It is now more urgent as Keir Starmer’s Labour party falls headlong into one moral void after another: surrendering to corporate raiders and the City, cutting disability benefits, placating racists, rescinding political rights, colluding with Israel’s genocide etc.Theprospect of a new partylit up this darkness with new hope. It inspiredhundreds of thousands to sign up. It ignited real hope, for the first time in decades, that a party based on socialist principles, and committed to grassroots democracy, could present a serious challenge to Margaret Thatcher’s dictum that there was no alternative.Expectations were high, the hope was exhilarating. Communication from the centre was sporadic and increasingly unsatisfactory, but still the enthusiasm remained.Now thelast few days have causedanxiety, confusion, despair and not a little anger. Many are at a loss to understand it, but the effect is devastating. One thing is clear: this public row must stop, and stop now.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A barefaced look was preferred – much like the “clean girl” trend of today. “In a censored society everyone needs debates about harmless topics,” says Koonz.Koonz is well-acquainted with the ways political strongmen rely on women’s labor at the family level to implement state ideology. Her 1986 book, Mothers in the Fatherland, describes how the ordinary women of Nazi Germany “operated at its very center”, incubating ideals of white supremacy, female subordination and sacrifice at home.View image in fullscreenFascism and the familyThinkers including 20th-century German theoristTheodor Adornoand contemporary American political philosopherGeorge Lakofftheorized about the paternalist personality of authoritarians, with Lakoff noting that in modern history, far-right authoritarian regimes institutionalize male authority through a family-like hierarchy: women are subservient to men and both obey the nation’s metaphorical “strict father”. In the home, paternal authority and maternal subservience prime children for a wider social order, teaching them to see women’s submission as stability, and to accept fear and conformity as the price of belonging.“There’s been a reluctance to name this moment as fascism,” says cultural historian Tiffany Florvil, yet extreme authoritarian dynamics can be clearly seen in the American right today. (Indeed,Trump supporters can’t seem tostopcalling him “Daddy”.)The government’s unprecedenteddeportationsof immigrants; use ofIceto unjustly detain people in detention centers fraught withhuman rights abuses; intimidation ofjudges,law firmsanduniversities; and assaults on thefundamental principles of liberal democracyare prompting historians who specialize in fascism toleave the country.And significant backlash against gender equality is under way. The idea that women’s bodies are state resources for sustaining population appears to be re-emerging; the Trump administration is encouraging traditional roles byrolling backworkplace equity,restrictingreproductive rights andpolicinggender identity.A woman’s “most glorious duty is to give children to her people and nation, children who can continue the line of generations and who guarantee the immortality of the nation”, Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propagandist,toldan audience of women in 1933. Racially selective population growth was core to the agenda of such nationalist, fascist regimes as Nazi Germany and Benito Mussolini’s Italy. The only path to honor for most women was birthing children, formalized throughfinancial rewardsandmedalsfor prolific mothers.The Nazi party [made] ordinary women feel valued in a way that women in more liberal parties didn’tClaudia Koonz, historianSimilarly, the Trump administration touts pronatalist rewards, such as a$1,000 government-funded investment accountfor new babies, and hasdiscussed others, including a “National Medal of Motherhood” for women with six children. While vice-president JD Vancecried: “I want more babies in the United States of America” at an anti-abortion rally in early 2025, Republicans in Congressplottedeliminating federal tax credits for daycare and other supports that enable women’s workforce participation – an effort to control women’s social roles.The administration’s policies suggest its goal is not only population growth but specificallymore white births. By rolling back reproductive rightsmoredrasticallythan at any point in the last 50 years, the Trump administration has set the stage forworseningmaternal mortality – especially for Black women, who die in childbirth at nearlythree-and-a-half timesthe rate of white women. It has also demonstrated hostility to people of color, tearingimmigrant families apart,curtailing immigrationandordering an endto birthright citizenship.Fascist pronatalist policy depends on the veneer of white, Christian “family values” – a strategy that echoes Scholtz-Klink’s work as Nazi Germany’s proto-influencer, promoting a sweet, soft life of “Kinder, Küche, Kirche” (“children, kitchen, church”). When interviewed, Scholtz-Klink insisted to Koonz that she and her female colleagues had nothing to do with concentration camps, genocide or political doctrine – that they barely even knew about those things. Instead, Scholtz-Klink made domestic and reproductive duty feel prestigious, rather than peremptory, helping “the Nazi party make ordinary women feel valued in a way that other women in more liberal parties didn’t”, Koonz says.Motherhood can be deeply fulfilling, and few would argue that family life is unimportant. Yet authoritarian movements have long politicized it, reframing it as women’s sole purpose and a substitute for autonomy and rights. National instability only amplifies the message that a woman’s rightful place is home with her children. “If there’s chaos,” Koonz says, “then the women who are keeping the home front stable have even more responsibility: ‘There’s chaos out there, but my family is going to have traditional values.’”View image in fullscreenHow women spread the domestic fantasyAs authoritarian regimes rise, they often rely on a women’s movement to keep society stable and operational on a household level, framing regressive policies in more approachable and alluring terms. This is especially true for fascist regimes, which rely on mass participation to advance their extreme nationalist agendas. Today, that role is being taken up by the digital“womanosphere”, also called the femosphere.A counterpart to the “manosphere”, an influential online sphere redolent with misogyny, the womanosphere is an informal web of online creators who rally around normative femininity. Its idea of womanhood is informed by anti-queerness, white supremacy, fundamentalist Christianity and traditional maternalism. It also maps on to the extreme, discriminatory agenda ofProject 2025, which aims to roll back historical victories of the women’s movement such as workplace equality, education and healthcare.These values are platformed byconservativemillennial and gen Z content creatorsincluding Alex Clark, host of the Maha wellness podcast Culture Apothecary;“professional yapper” Brett Cooper; YouTuber Isabel Brown; conservative provocateur Candace Owens; anti-transgender activist and podcast host Riley Gaines; Christian influencer Allie Beth Stuckey; and publications such as the “conservative Cosmo”,Evie magazine. Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk’s conservative student group, held ayearly women’s summitwhere marriage, procreation and homemaking were key topics.Womanosphere content ranges from the overtly political to what might, at first glance, look like ordinary lifestyle aesthetics. Thesenostalgic visions of beauty– wholesome, aspirational representations of gardening, cooking, wellness and motherhood, embodied by “trad” homemaking influencers such asHannah Neelemanand Sarah Therese – have broad appeal. While not all “cottagecore” creators are conservative proselytizers, this type of content is noted for its role in an“alt-right” pipeline, where liberatory innovations such as birth control are framed as “toxic”, and the ideal status is married, barefoot and pregnant.Now comes the ‘womanosphere’: the anti-feminist media telling women to be thin, fertile and RepublicanRead moreWomanosphere content elevates the joys of the home and motherhood while sidelining women’s mounting social and political disenfranchisement, ultimately reinforcing fascist values such as gender hierarchy and duty to the nation. To Koonz, it all feels like more of the same thing: “children, kitchen and church” for the digital age.In the womanosphere, the home is a woman’s place: good, normal women want to stay there. This digital movement reflects what feminist media scholar Dr Jilly Boyce Kaycalls“reactionary feminism”, an anti-progressive backlash that argues “commitment, affection, and protection” are women’s “evolutionarily-determined ‘interests’”, with little room for nuance.The womanosphere trades in individualistic strategies for rebelling against the perceived liberal status quo, reinforcing age-old gender hierarchies. Namely, if a woman is financially dependent on a husband, she is free from the burden of paid employment and can devote herself fully to domestic life, rather than splitting her time between job and home. The crushing pressure on women to both work and domost of the housework– as well as thepublic health crisisof parental burnout – make these arguments seductive.But womanosphere content tends to gloss over complex material realities; for instance, the conditions that made single-breadwinner households more viable in the 1950s no longer exist. Attacks on reproductive rights actually curtail the futures women are able to choose, and without financial independence, women can be unable to leave situations of domestic violence.Womanosphere creators often espouse the wisdom of removing oneself from the sphere of market-mediated labor while monetizing their contentSophie Lewis, feminist theoristWomen like Scholtz-Klink grasped the historically rare opportunity to distinguish themselves in authoritarian regimes by becoming mouthpieces; today, no official sanction is required (though political groups dofund content creators through often opaque campaigns). The attention economy offers its own incentives, and the contrarianism of women fighting gender parity can make for algorithmic gold. The hypocrisy is evident: womanosphere creators often espouse the wisdom of removing oneself from “the sphere of market-mediated labor while, in fact, monetizing their content”, says Sophie Lewis, feminist theorist and author of the recent book Enemy Feminisms: Terfs, Policewomen, and Girlbosses Against Liberation.Womanosphere influencers often post nonchalantly misogynistic content. Recently, influencer Alex Clark, who has boasted about her “sneaky” tactic of spreading ideology through wellness content, platformeda guestwho claimed that when women “step into the masculine” – by expressing anger, assertiveness or authority – it “actually literally kills [them]”, citing rising rates of breast cancer as proof. For the sake of their own health, the clip suggests, women should remain docile and calm.But patriarchal politics hurt women, even those who participate: far-right Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greenetoldthe Daily Mail this August that there are “women in our party that are really sick and tired of the way [Republican] men treat Republican women”. Republican women realize they cannot getabortionswhen they need them. Cooper, the womanosphere creator,admittedto the New York Times that rightwing peers have called her “crazy” for working while pregnant. Lauren Southern, a Canadian influencer who rose to fame posting content critical of feminism and immigration, recently released amemoirconfessing she was emotionally tortured in her traditionalist marriage. “The most miserable people I’ve met have been stuck in this weird, larpy trad dynamic,” Southern saidin an interviewthis May.View image in fullscreenWhen the state fails, women step inFascism may betray women, but it still relies on their support.“What fascisms old and new have in common is they tend to look to women to fill in the gaps that the state misses,” says historian Diana Garvin.Mussolini’s fascist Italy engineered an image of modernization, economic growth and agricultural plenty from the 1920s to the 40s. But after Mussolini alienated trade partners, Italy’s reliance on domestic products contributed to food shortages so severe Italians did not have enough wheat to make pasta. In her 2022 book Feeding Fascism: The Politics of Women’s Food Work, Garvin writes that the state’s propagandist narrative of domestic bliss concealed systemic reliance on women’s unpaid labor in the home; mothers were expected to absorb food shortages through their own ingenuity and hard work.Systems are crumbling – but daily life continues. The dissonance is realRead moreItalian lifestyle magazines such as La Cucina Italiana worked to launder the food scarcity resulting from Mussolini’s poor governance into a source of individual pride, sharing pictures of little girls who grew prize vegetables and offering recipes using leftover rice. The government wanted women to cover for its failures, and “be happy about it”, says Garvin.Similar efforts may be required in the US as Donald Trump guts what remains of a paltry social safety net. The administration has cut funding tohealthcareand theEnvironmental Protection Agency; dismantled theDepartment of Education, reducing the accessibility and equity of education for children; and downgraded systems intended to keep the food supply safe, including staff cuts at theFood and Drug Administration.Under the pretense of a return to rugged individualism, the Trump administration is abdicating responsibility for American needs. In July, the US Department of Homeland Security posted kitsch art ofa frontier couple cradling a babyon social media, with the caption “Remember your Homeland’s Heritage.” The message: Americans should be proud of their resilience, as they are being left on their own.Womanosphere influencers prime women to romanticize duty and encourage them to dismiss feminist political engagement as woke nonsense. They help direct the national conversation away from how the government could invest in communities through benefits such as better housing stability, paid family leave, Medicare for all and universal, affordable childcare. Democrats’ failure to adequately support and value women has enabled the right to capitalize on widespread dissatisfaction, convincing women to expect less from a nation that could give them more.Without adequate and accessible medical care, food and education, mothers can end up becoming de facto home teachers, farmers and medics.Without adequate and accessible medical care, food and education, mothers can end up becoming de facto home teachers, farmers andmedics. Trad influencers gloss this unjust workload as a homage to homesteading (and leverage it tomarket unsubstantiated remedies) instead of calling it what it is: picking up the state’s slack. Cuts to education seem less threatening when you are convinced your role is to homeschool your children; aless safe,more expensivefood supply seems less problematic when you believe everyone should be growing their own produce and making everything from scratch;defundingthe Center for Disease Control does not seem so bad when you have been conditioned to distrust vaccines and believe you can cure a child’s measles with “herbal remedies or old food medicine”.Mussolini’s government also “really wanted to get women out of middle-class jobs so that they could open up those spaces for men, because there had been real employment problems”, says Garvin. The nation used the cultural trope of the “donna-crisi” or “crisis woman” – a negative stereotype of an urban and independent woman, similar to the contemporary American right’s “victim of feminism” or JD Vance’s “childless cat ladies” – to slander working women. Yet while propaganda promoted the image of middle and upper-class women sheltered from work, the reality was more calculated, says Garvin: fascist Italy wanted lower-class women in the workforce, where they could be paid less than men.Sexual assault allegations seem to be a badge of honor in Trump’s America. Was #MeToo an epic failure?Read moreIn July, the Trump administration imposednew work requirements for Medicaid, a state-federal program providing healthcare to more than 77 million low-income people, 80% of them women with a median age of 40. Agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins has suggested these citizens can work in US farms to maintain their coverage, replacing deported immigrant workers. ​​For all their promises of domestic bliss, classical European fascist regimes senthousewivesinto factories andfieldswhen labor was needed. Consistently, it is women who are ultimately expected to shoulder the burdens of the nation’s failure.Women who become obedient domestic caretakers may be willfully, even happily, bearing the mantle. They may believe they see a fundamental truth in assuming dependence as the price of security, trusting that patriarchy will protect them so long as they keep its house spotless and bake its bread with a smile. Yet many do not reckon with the influence of hypocritical propaganda on their choices – or with the consequences of accommodating a tyranny that could turn on them.In place of freedom, equality, power and choice, the Trump regime offers women flattery and a duplicitously simplistic worldview that denies their agency. While women are crucial to the Maga project, some of its supporters have begun to realize that traditional life is not just a halcyon fantasy of the past, but a harbinger of a forlorn future. Life on the patriarchal homestead may not turn out as rosy as advertised."

He was saying public services are all crap, everything’s collapsing, we’ve got a high tax burden and his answer was just to abandon it all. I said no, that was because of austerity.

The difficulties we encounter are frequently the result of self-sabotage, and managing them often requires wrestling with our own drives, doing our best not to give in to every impulse. This is easier said than done, of course. To lose weight and keep it off, to successfully climb out of debt, to find meaningful work, to maintain long-term, happy relationships: all demand postponing our immediate desires in the service of a longer-term goal.Delaying gratification, as it’s called, has been a useful tactic for aeons. But at a certain point it becomes reasonable to ask: why doessomuch of modern life seem to involve swimming upstream? Why is it that following our instincts often seems to land us in so much trouble?One of the central ideas in the field of evolutionary psychology is that of “evolutionary mismatch”. Put simply, we evolved in a very different environment from the one in which we now find ourselves. As a result, our brains, bodies and instincts are poorly matched to their surroundings.How much does this really matter? Isn’t a hallmark of being human our species’ ability to adapt to changing circumstances? Yes and no. Yes, we have a remarkable ability to deal with new problems, collaborate to find solutions, and create technology to help us realise them. At the same time, anthropologists estimate that human genetics and anatomy have remained largely unchanged for about 100,000 years. Back then, we lived in small nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes, only developing agriculture about 10,000 years ago and civilisations 5,000 years ago.For all but avanishingly small number of us, the contemporary human habitat isn’t the one we were made for. Genetic adaptations (which can take tens of thousands of years) could hardly be expected to keep up with the move to cities, let alone technological and cultural shifts, which can have dramatic impacts within a single lifetime. So what has the fallout been?Perhaps the starkest impact has been on our waistlines. The instinct to binge on foods rich in salt, fat and sugar kept people alive for most of human history, when the next meal was never guaranteed. Now we live in a world where calories are cheap, and where scientists devote whole careers to making foods “hyperpalatable” – which is to say far more appealing than any food found in nature. These artificial snacks interfere with the body’s ability to regulate appetite, making it very difficult to have just one crisp, or just one biscuit. Obesity, previously rare, has now overtaken malnutrition as the leading public health issue relating to diet in many parts of the world.The realm of dating (and mating) has also changed beyond all recognition. A strong drive to find the right sexual partner was indispensable when we banded together in tribes of about 150 people against an unforgiving world. But in those days, the pool of potential mates was small. Now we have devices that connect us to thousands upon thousands of them. As a result, the process often becomes protracted and overwhelming – a phase of life characterised by choice paralysis, hurtful behaviour such as ghosting, and the constant anxiety that our true soulmate is just a swipe away.In the same way that hyperpalatable foods exploit our ancient appetites, AI-driven tools such as ChatGPT have begun to exploit our deep desire for meaningRising rates of depression and other mental health problems can also be viewed through the lens of mismatch. Hunter-gatherer life involved constant companionship, hands-on work that was immediately rewarding (such as finding food or building shelter), and communities rich with tradition, ritual and spiritual meaning. Modern technology now makes most of these things optional, rather than essential. As a consequence many of us are living a life disconnected from others, lacking in fulfilling work and devoid of meaning. Seen in this context, low mood is not the misfiring of a broken brain, but a signal that we might be missing out on important aspects of human experience.To deal with these gaps, some of us turn back to technology. In the same way that hyperpalatable foods exploit our ancient appetites, AI-driven tools such as ChatGPT and Replika have begun to exploit our deep desire for meaning, as well as social and romantic connection. AI companies themselves have beensurprisedby the extent to which people become emotionally attached to their products. Andreportsare emerging that chatbots can fuel the delusions and paranoid thinking of people vulnerable to psychosis.None of this is to say that the right path for humanity is to attempt to return to the distant past. Hunter-gatherers did not live in utopian harmony like the Na’vi in Avatar. Rather, I am suggesting that there is a powerful explanation for many of our current physical and mental difficulties, and it’s that the world has developed in ways our biology hasn’t been able to keep up with. If you don’t take this into account as you look at your own life, instead expecting yourself to perform like some kind of highly optimised machine, you open the door to profound self-criticism and resentment. The frustration of not being able to lose weight, the emptiness of the job you were always told to want, the loneliness of modern cities – these can all feel like individual failures.Conversely, understanding the life we evolved for allows us to look at our problems with more clarity and self-compassion, and can nudge us towards better, more informed decisions. Rather than berating ourselves for not being able to control our impulses, we can see them through the lens of mismatch and start to think about helpful mitigations. Some solutions are straightforward, like keeping junk food out of the house, deleting social media apps or limiting screen time.Others are more complex, and require stepping back to see the bigger picture. Community, collaborative problem-solving, ritual and meaning are vital ingredients for a satisfying life and will remain so, whatever technology we invent or cultural trends bubble up. Thinking about how to build these into our lives so that they’re part of its fabric, rather than optional extras, is a potentially life-changing exercise. Not because there’s anything wrong with us – but because we find ourselves in strange times.Dr Alex Curmi is a psychiatrist, psychotherapist in training and presenter ofThe Thinking Mindpodcast.Further readingThe Social Brain: The Psychology of Successful Groupsby Tracey Camilleri, Samantha Rockey and Robin Dunbar (Penguin, £10.99)The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating by David M Buss (Basic, £16.99)Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst by Robert Sapolsky (Vintage, £12.99)Explore more on these topicsEvolutionThe big ideaPsychologyAnthropologyBiologyMental healthHealth & wellbeingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hair and makeup: Emma Rankin using Westman Atelier and RareFamilyFor years I struggled with infertility and loss. Then I had a life-changing call with a psychicOn some level, I realised it was a bit unhinged, writes the author and podcaster Elizabeth Day. But what did I have to lose?Elizabeth DaySun 21 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTShareOn 29 December 2022, I received a text. ‘Hi mum I’m texting you off a friends phone I’ve smashed mine and their phones about to die, can you WhatsApp my new number x’ I was in a rental car when I got it, my partner at the wheel next to me as we drove down an anonymous stretch of motorway. Both the sky and the road were grey. It was that indeterminate space between Christmas and New Year when the days become sludgy and diffuse; a time when teenagers meet up with their friends to go shopping or gather in each other’s homes and post Snapchats or exchange festive gossip while pretending not to vape. It was the time of waiting – for the next thing to happen, for the promised excitement of New Year’s Eve and snogging underneath leftover mistletoe. So it wasn’t a particularly unusual text to receive, especially not given the trademark adolescent lack of grammar and punctuation.There was just one thing.I wasn’t a mother.Not yet.Because I was also waiting, suspended in silvery threads of an ambiguous hope. Three days previously, my husband, Justin, and I had flown to Los Angeles for our latest round of fertility treatment. This time, we had opted to try for pregnancy using an egg donor. We’d had the embryo transferred the morning after our plane landed.View image in fullscreen‘In the grip of existential uncertainty, I had begun exploring a different kind of logic. I had started looking for signs’I’d had a totally sober festive season until that point, sipping non-alcoholic wine to accompany the Christmas roast. My cocktails had been a carefully calibrated combination of oestrogen and progesterone rather than the kind I generally preferred, which were served in ice-cold martini glasses with extra brine.Justin and I hadn’t chosen for this to be our Christmas, but when you go through fertility treatment, you realise that timing as it exists for other people is beyond your control. You are at the mercy of hormonal fluctuations, the thickness (or otherwise) of your uterine lining and the inconsistent vagaries of menstrual cycles.And so, in the grip of existential uncertainty, I had begun exploring a different kind of logic – one that existed outside the parameters of rationality. I had started looking for signs. Call it superstition, spirituality or plain old stupidity, but I saluted pairs of magpies and took care not to walk under ladders. I went to a shaman in south London who performed rituals with feathers and pieces of rock. I wrote a letter to my future child. I tried to meditate and manifest and think positive and talk in a healthy way to my own body. I saw meaning in everything – a dream, a floating feather, a robin redbreast who turned up in the garden one unseasonably warm day in July. All of this, I told myself, was sent to tell me something. The universe was signalling that I was destined to have a child.At some level, I realised this was unhinged. I understood that, in the sea of my own sadness, I had latched on to any passing piece of driftwood to keep afloat. In a precarious world, certainty – just like hope – is an addictive placebo.Like many women who experience misplaced shame, I readily set about internalising the failure as my ownOn I clung. I told myself that receiving that text calling me “mum” was the surest sign yet that I was on the right path. I recalled listening to a podcast that claimed successful manifestation relied on acting as though you already possessed what you most desired. This was a test, I realised. I had to demonstrate that I was capable of maternal love.So I replied with extra care and kindness to that unknown texter using their friend’s WhatsApp number. I said they’d got the wrong person but I hoped everything would be sorted out.As I returned my phone to my pocket, I thought back to the preceding years of unsuccessful fertility treatment and recurrent miscarriage. I thought of the slow-motion grief they had caused me; the belief that I would never be fulfilled unless I had a baby. I thought of the difficult decision Justin and I had taken to pursue egg donation. I thought of the embryo now nesting inside me. And I thought:it was all meant to be. It led us here.This would turn out to be true, but not in the way I had anticipated. Because it would be a psychic, rather than a baby, who would change my life for ever.I’d spent the previous 12 years failing to have babies. During my first marriage, I’d had two unsuccessful rounds ofIVFfollowed by a “natural” pregnancy, which I lost at three months. I was in hospital for that miscarriage and can still recall seeing the blotted, bloodied remains of my much-longed-for child in a kidney-shaped cardboard tray the nurses had given me.Some months later, that marriage ended in the throes of a peculiar sadness: simultaneous grief for what was, for what might have been, and for what had never existed. I thought I was dealing with it but, in truth, I was numb. There seemed to be no way of communicating the magnitude of the loss. Not back then, anyway, when miscarriage and infertility were still barely talked about. A loved one advised me to treat it like a heavy period. Another questioned why I’d told anyone I was pregnant before the three-month mark, as if not speaking about it would have made it less real.And so, like many women who experience misplaced shame, I readily set about internalising the failure as my own. The doctors told me my infertility was “unexplained” – a diagnosis so blank that I could quite easily shade it with my own self-loathing. It was, I determined, all my fault.In my late 30s, I did a cycle of egg freezing at a different clinic. Once again, I was told my results were disappointing: two eggs, where most women my age could have expected about 15. By the time I met Justin, I was 39 and he was 43, with three children from a previous relationship. I decided I would try to be happy without a baby of my own. But then we got pregnant naturally just after my 41st birthday. That ended in miscarriage at seven weeks. We were both so devastated we realised we wanted to try again. We travelled to Athens, to a new clinic and a new set of protocols, and I had an operation to remove a uterine septum. Within a month, I was pregnant again. At seven weeks, we had a scan and saw and heard a heartbeat. At eight weeks, the heartbeat had gone. By now, the UK was in the grip of its first national Covid lockdown. I took pills to trigger a miscarriage at home. The pain was horrendous. Of my three miscarriages, this was the worst to get through.View image in fullscreen‘The doctor made it seem straightforward. All we had to do was find a suitable donor, for which he recommended hiring a “fertility consultant”’I took a few months off the ceaseless trying in order to feel my way back into my own body, to reconnect with who I was when I wasn’t riding a wave of pregnancy hormones, or having my insides prodded and scanned and examined by unfamiliar hands. When Covid restrictions started to lift, I was allowed to book a sports massage at home via an app. The masseur was Polish and when he began working on the left-hand side of my lower stomach, I gasped. He had pressed the exact point where I felt the aching, yawning tenderness of pregnancy loss. It was a very specific sensation, starting in the womb, then spreading through my synapses. I thought I might faint.“You have a lot of sadness here,” the masseur said.“Yes,” I replied, eyes closed, trying not to cry.Lockdowns lifted, vaccinations rolled out, and fertility clinics resumed their normal business. We had been recommended a place in LA by friends. This clinic, we were told, was at the forefront of fertility medicine (“Because lots of Hollywood stars get to their late 40s and the acting parts dry up and then they decide they want a child,” said one of my more cynical acquaintances).The clinic’s website looked impressive and claimed to offer several cutting-edge procedures that weren’t available anywhere else. In October 2021, Justin and I joined a Zoom call with one of the leading consultants, who apparently had a legion of celebrity children to his name. He was robotic in manner, listing all the ways in which he could ensure higher than average success rates. He advised egg donation.It was surreal scrolling through pages of beautiful donors you could filter according to height, education, hair, eye colourThe doctor made it seem straightforward. All we had to do was find a suitable donor, for which he recommended hiring a “fertility consultant”. This person would assess relevant medical histories and physical traits in potential donors to ensure their compatibility. In the UK, it is illegal to pay someone for their eggs but donors can receive up to £985 expenses per cycle. Donor-conceived children then have the right to access identifying information about their donor when they turn 18. But in the US, the laws are different – donors are paid a fee (typically, $5,000 to $10,000, but sometimes tens of thousands of dollars), and you can access hundreds of websites containing extensive profiles and photographs. It was surreal and a little dystopian scrolling through pages upon pages of beautiful women whom you could filter according to height, education, hair and eye colour. The women answered questions about their favourite books (The Alchemist and Harry Potter were popular choices and, for me I’m afraid, automatic cause for disqualification). They also listed their preferred foods and hobbies. It felt like a strange kind of speed dating.It took us over a year to find our donor. We got close a few times, but then we’d uncover some incompatible medical issue or they would change their minds and pull out. We also got defrauded by the consultant we’d hired, and the clinic was shockingly poor in its communication. The whole thing cost an inordinate amount of time and money, and I’m aware of my privilege in being able – just about – to afford it. Still, it was one of the most stressful periods of my life.Eventually, we found an amazing young woman (favourite book: Plato’s Republic) who wanted to help us. We remain so incredibly grateful to her.The donor’s egg retrieval was scheduled in LA. On the other side of the Atlantic, my cycle was synced with hers. The eggs were then fertilised with my husband’s sperm, resulting in four embryos, two of which were deemed to have a good cell number, minimal fragmentation and optimal symmetry. The embryos were awarded an AA grade, as if they were premium hotels. Apparently, these two had the highest chances of implantation in my womb (and were presumably offered late checkout and in-room spa treatments).Justin and I flew out to LA on Boxing Day 2022. The weather was terrible – one of those freak patches of torrential rain that sometimes beset the city – and our windscreen wipers squeaked and slid across the glass as we drove to the clinic. I changed into a surgical gown and lay on a gurney before being wheeled into theatre to have the embryo transferred via catheter to my womb. Before I was sedated, our doctor beamed a picture of our chosen embryo on to a TV screen hung high up on the wall.“An absolutely beautiful embryo,” he said.I squeezed Justin’s hand more tightly.This time, I thought, I had done everything right. I had taken all the drugs and undergone all the necessary surgical interventions and been monitored closely by the best medical professionals. I had gone to acupuncture and yoga and followed nutritional advice and eaten shedloads of protein and taken the correct supplements. I had done all the spiritual work I possibly could. I had followed everyone’s advice. All the signs were there. This time, I tried to convince myself, it was going to be OK.In the 10-day waiting period that followed, Justin had to return to London for work and I stayed in LA, with a quietly blooming feeling of cautious optimism. I had all the pregnancy symptoms – mid-afternoon exhaustion, nausea, sore boobs, vivid dreams. I went for a walk along Venice Beach one afternoon and wrote the name we’d picked out for our child in the sand.On the allotted morning, I went into the clinic for a blood test and was told I’d be phoned that afternoon with the results. Instead, they sent me an email. They had analysed my bloods. I wasn’t pregnant. “Cease all medication immediately,” the email read. Those symptoms I’d been experiencing? They were simply a result of the hormones I’d been taking. And all those signs I’d believed had been sent from the universe? They hadn’t meant a thing either.Justin cancelled everything and flew back to LA so we could be together – an act of love, if ever there was one. But I felt unmoored and exhausted and horribly sad. I remember FaceTiming with my best friend, Emma, shortly after we’d got the news.“What’s wrong with your eyes?” she asked.“Nothing,” I said. “Why?”“They look a bit … funny.”I glanced at myself reflected in the screen and could see straight away what she meant. My eyes were glittery and disconnected, as if I were viewing the world from the seabed of a deep ocean. I didn’t recognise my own features. I didn’t recognise myself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We still had one embryo left. The clinic advised us to try again straight away, possibly with a surrogate, but I just couldn’t face it. Well-meaning strangers would mention adoption, without realising that the adoption process is itself far from straightforward and could take years. I was already 44 and felt lost and letdown. I was angry with our doctor, angry at the callousness of the clinic’s email, angry at the entire fertility industry, and angry with anyone who had ever had an uncomplicated pregnancy that ended with a healthy child being born. But, most of all, I was angry at the illusory stories I’d believed – all those beautiful lies I’d told myself.I went for breakfast with a friend. She had recently split from a long-term partner and, in passing, mentioned a psychic who had given her a freakishly accurate telephone reading in which a future romance was outlined in detail.And even though I thought I was done with that woo‑woo stuff, I just couldn’t help myself.“Could I speak to her?” I asked.My friend gave me the psychic’s number and a few key pieces of advice: text to arrange the appointment; don’t give your full name (no possibility of her Googling); and when she calls, don’t ask her any questions (too leading).I followed her advice to the letter. The psychic, whom I will call Alexia, called me at 7pm on a Wednesday evening. Her voice was warm, her accent American.“Is Elizabeth your real name?” she asked.“Yes.”“OK, let’s see what’s here for you.” A pause. “Well,” she chuckled. “You love words.”I did! I loved words so much! At the most challenging points of my fertility journey, I often counted myself incredibly lucky to have a writing career I was passionate about. I had written eight books when I spoke to Alexia and my ninth was about to be published. She went on to say several other things that were spot-on, including identifying that my partner’s name began with a J and describing what he did for a living. Alexia asked if my mother had experienced neck pain recently (I later checked: she’d just booked a session with an osteopath after putting her neck out).“OK, so you write books but do you also do something else?” Alexia continued. “I’m getting … it’s almost like, I don’t know … you’re a life coach helping people through their failures or mistakes?”I didn’t feel sadness; I felt relief. Because sometimes quitting, not persisting, is the bravest thing you can doSince 2018, I’ve had a podcast calledHow to Fail, where I interview guests about three times they’ve failed in their lives and what they might have learned along the way. Not quite life coaching, but not a million miles away either. To reiterate: Alexia didn’t know my full name so wouldn’t have been able to look me up online. Might she have recognised my voice from the podcast? I felt it was unlikely given that she was American, and most of my listeners are UK-based. Also, if shehadactually been able to research me, wouldn’t she have been more direct and simply stated outright that I was a podcaster? Similarly, although she could tell instantly I was a writer, it took her about half an hour to identify correctly whether I wrote books or film scripts – again, with no guidance from me. Not once did she mention journalism, even though that is one of the first things that comes up if you do Google me. All of this gave me confidence in her, even in my newly sceptical state.Then, after about 40 minutes, Alexia said: “I feel as if you’re grappling with letting go of a lifelong desire. You don’t know whether to let it go or not.”“Uh-huh,” I replied, on the other end of the phone line. “That makes sense.”“I don’t know whether it’s to do with children but, if it is, I want to tell you – and I don’t always talk about past lives, but with you I get a very strong sense that you were a mother in a past life. You were the mother of six and it almost melted you.”It was such a striking phrase that I noted it down afterwards. “Melted” was the precise word she used.“And I feel this life has been offered to you to live on your own terms,” Alexia continued. “Which might be why, if you’ve tried to have babies before now, you could have experienced fertility issues or miscarriage.”I was dumbstruck. The number six was particularly important. I’d had three miscarriages and undergone three unsuccessful rounds of fertility treatment and each cycle had ended after an embryo transfer. Essentially, I’d had six failed pregnancies.“Be careful what you wish for,” Alexia carried on. “Sometimes, when we push really, really hard for something we think we want, and there seem to be lots of obstacles in our way, it’s because we’re being protected.”She told me a story of her own, about a relative whose child had been in a car accident and who was now in a persistent vegetative state. It had been a living tragedy, Alexia said, and so, really, there was no guarantee that having a child led to the happiness we yearn for.View image in fullscreen‘I started asking myself: what if my purpose in this lifetime wasnotto be a mother?’“I hope you don’t mind me sharing that,” Alexia said.“No, no, of course not.”In truth, I was grateful. So often during the preceding 12 years, I’d told myself a hundred different fairytales of how completed I’d feel by motherhood. But in a world where the most positive version of events exists, there also has to be the possibility of the most negative, too: a child who is ill or unhappy or who doesn’t love you back. Alexia gave me permission to imagine that. She gave me permission to stop trying so hard without it feeling like weakness. When she gave me that permission, I didn’t feel sadness; I felt relief. Because sometimes quitting, not persisting, is the bravest thing you can do.And the thing was, I had always had a deep-rooted, secret feeling that Iknewwhat it was to be a mother. I felt I had held babies in my arms and taken a toddler’s pudgy hand in mine, and smelled that milky, biscuity scent from the back of a sleeping child’s neck. It was as if my soul remembered. So, no, maybe I wouldn’t be a mother in this lifetime. But maybe I had been in the past. Maybe I would be in another.I’m sure there will be people reading this who don’t believe Alexia was accessing some collective spiritual energy to deliver me the message I most needed to hear. They will argue that she kept her observations vague enough that I could interpret whatever I wanted from them. And that’s totally fine. I’m not trying to convert anyone. If you didn’t have the experience I did, you can’t know how utterly real it felt to me.After speaking to her, I started to wonder whether all those signs from the universe (or whatever you want to call it) were in fact guiding me and protecting me. It’s simply that the destination wasn’t the one I’d pictured, so I was interpreting them wrongly. And there was part of me – the bruised, defensive part – that thought,well, even if none of this is true, isn’t it easier for me to believe it is?I started asking myself: what if my purpose in this lifetime wasnotto be a mother? What if, instead, it was to speak for others who go through similar pain and to reassure them that there is hope on the other side of it? What if I chose to focus on the abundance of love I already had in my life, rather than the absence of another kind? We cannot, all of us, have everything.The next day, I walked past a woman pushing her child in a buggy in the street. I smiled at her. All the bitterness and angst I had felt for so long had evaporated. It was magical; almost miraculous. At first, I didn’t think the sensation would last. Yet now, almost three years later, I still feel that same lifted peace. Of course, I also still feel grief, but it’s not constant. Sometimes, the sadness will rear up in unexpected moments and I’ve learned to let it, because I know it will pass. I’ve learned, too, that just because we feel sad for the life we didn’t live, doesn’t mean we made the wrong choices in this one.‘I was struck by the grammar of it, the angular nature’: Elizabeth Day’s best phone pictureRead moreAlthough I haven’t felt the need to contact Alexia again, I’ve booked a number of sessions for loved ones going through challenges. Each time, they report back to me and are astonished by her accuracy and the comfort she is able to give them. Each time, she says something different. A friend who didn’t believe in psychics, who gave a fake name for himself and his family members, has been fundamentally changed by what Alexia was able to tell him about a sick relative, his career and his relationship.A few months after my own experience with Alexia, I started writing a new novel. The plot and the characters came to me in a blissful rush. I wrote as if the brakes had been taken off, as if I were no longer pushing a metaphorical boulder up an unforgiving hill. I wrote, in short, as if being myself was enough. It was the most fun and creatively fulfilling experience I’ve ever had writing a book. It will be published a few days after the baby whose name I wrote in the sand would have turned two.And that text I received from the kid with the broken phone? I Googled it recently. It’s an internet scam. I suppose it could have been a sign from the universe to stop believing false promises. But maybe it wasn’t a sign at all. Maybe our task in this world is to build our own meanings – like fires lit from the kindling of many lives.One of Us by Elizabeth Day is published by 4th Estate (£18.99).

He was such a sweetheart.”Perhaps it is because he is currently filming King Lear that Pacino is preoccupied with our collective crawl toward death. He recently rewatched his younger self in Dog Day Afternoon, a Hollywood classic that celebrates its 50th anniversary on Sunday, and was struck by how many of the cast are now gone.“It hits you, seeing all those people in Dog Day,” the 85-year-old says by phone from Los Angeles. “Can you imagine how you feel? Wow. It’s like a dream. You’re dreaming. You have a dream of someone and you’re so happy about the dream and then you wake up and they’re not there any more? They don’t even exist – in three dimensions anyway.”‘Say hello to my little pen’: 14 things we learned from Al Pacino’s memoirRead moreCinema, of course, is one way to cheat death, at least in two dimensions. On screen Pacino will forever be a raw, vulnerable, incandescent presence in Dog Day Afternoon, a crime drama based on the true story of a bank heist that went wrong – and one of the earliest mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge that transgender people existed.Pacino plays Sonny Wortzik, a desperate man who, along with his partner Sal (John Cazale), attempts to rob a bank in Brooklyn, New York, to fund his partner’s gender-transition surgery. The heist turns into a chaotic hostage situation as Sonny’s personal struggles and a media frenzy unfold. The movie was directed bySidney Lumetand won an Oscar for Frank Pierson’s screenplay.Pacino had just played Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part II, a tough act for anyone to follow. He was approached about Dog Day Afternoon by Martin Bregman, who had been his personal manager and the producer of Serpico, also directed by Lumet and starring Pacino.“He told me he wanted me to do it, and I had read it and thought it was well-written but I didn’t want to do it,” Pacino recalls. “I was in London at the time and I thought, I’m running out of gas. I don’t know if I could do this again.“It seemed having that kind of intensity again and going through that was too close, I thought, to The Godfather II, which was an intense experience in a lot of ways – not the actual work but everything that had been happening in my personal life was affecting me.”Pacino turned the role down. “I thought, all right, I understand it’s a great offer and thank you but I don’t think I can do this. I’d like to pass.” He adds with a chuckle: “Once again, I’ve got some kind of gun and I’m gonna go in a bank and rob it: I don’t want to go through that.”Pacino settled back into life in New York but then“Bregman came back to mebecause they had someone else who said they wanted to do it, who was notorious, who was a famous actor.”Widely reported to beDustin Hoffman?Pacino denies knowledge of this, describing instead how Bregman persuaded him to take another look at the script. “He calls me. I read the text and realise this is more than what I even thought it was. This is an interesting, powerful piece of work. I knew Sidney was involved, who I loved; we did Serpico together.“The first thought I had was, why did I pass this up? Where was I in my head? He [Bregman] was a very wise man. I said, ‘Why aren’t I doing this, Mr B?’ He said, ‘I don’t know. Why aren’t you doing it?’ I said, ‘Yeah, OK, I’ll do it.’ He said, ‘All right.’ I guess he had some work to do or whatever he did but they gave me the part and that was it.”Al Pacino on how he got his Modigliani film off the ground after 30 yearsRead moreLumet gave the cast – many of whom had worked with Pacino on stage – three weeks to rehearse before shooting began, a rarity in the film industry. But Pacino had trouble finding his feet.He says: “For some reason, I felt as though I didn’t know who the character I was playing was. I kind of left that out of the rehearsals or something. I don’t know what happened but I knew when I saw something on the screen I said: no. I saw I didn’t have a character so I thought, what am I doing, where am I, who am I, where am I going?“I went home that night, took half a gallon of white wine, which I don’t usually drink, for some reason and spent the whole night finding a character within myself from the script. I come in the next day and of course Lumet is looking at me like, what happened, Al? The cast – my friends – are saying, ‘I think he’s having a breakdown.’“But I wasn’t. I was becoming somebody else, I think. I was becoming the guy that’s in the film. I don’t know to this day if I was kidding myself or what. But I did go through that and it helped me. Let’s put it that way: whether I was right or wrong to do it, it did help me with it. I had something to work with personally.”View image in fullscreenA poster for Dog Day Afternoon.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarOne of the film’s most famous lines was improvised on the spur of the moment. It was a reference a 1971 incident in which prisoners seized control of the maximum-security Attica correctional facility near Buffalo, New York, taking 42 staff members hostage and demanding improvements to inmate treatment and living conditions. The standoff ended in a violent assault by state police resulting in the deaths of 33 prisoners and 10 hostages, making it the deadliest prison riot in US history.With the heist in progress, Pacino’s character sometimes steps out of the bank to talk to the police, watched by a crowd of extras who have begun to cheer each appearance. Before one such exchange, the assistant director Burtt Harris whispered to Pacino to ask the crowd about Attica.“The cameras are rolling. He comes up to me. He says, ‘Come here, come here. Al, say Attica.’ I say, ‘What the f–.’ He says, ‘Say Attica.’ I’m on the run so I go out and I’m there and it’s in my head because I know all about Attica because I was around when it was happening.”As he sees a police officer moving towards him, Sonny shouts: “He wants to kill me so bad he can taste it!” Pacino recalls: “It seemed like the right spot. I said, ‘Remember Attica! Attica!’ The crowd took off. It was like a fuse that started lighting everybody up.“I started screaming because we all felt the same way about what happened at Attica. I mean, it was amazing. I knew I had them then. Those kind of things can happen in film; they occasionally do. As long as you don’t force-feed it, as long as it becomes a natural environmental thing that happens, it just happens.”Another totemic scene, in which Sonny and his partner Leon (Chris Sarandon), who identifies as a woman, have a long phone conversation, was improvised across three takes that Lumet then cut together. Pacino says: “One day he told me right there outside, ‘Al, this is out of our hands. It’s got its own life.’”Lumet was a giant of cinema whose other works would include 12 Angry Men,Networkand The Verdict. Pacino says: “He was the greatest director I ever worked with, in terms of working with. There’s other great directors, of course, I was fortunate enough to be with and film with, but as far as Sidney was concerned, he was understanding of the actors.“Directors came to see Sidney work. When he was on the cameras, how he operates, how he sets up a shot.”Pacino was “stunned” to meet the Italian directorFederico Fellinion the set of Dog Day Afternoon. Fellini had wanted him for a part but then decided he was not the right fit. “I remember him saying a compliment to me: ‘You are too good-looking for this role.’ I thought, wow, he knows how to handle an actor, doesn’t he? What a thing to say. OK!”View image in fullscreenAl Pacino and Penny Allen in Dog Day Afternoon.Photograph: Images/Rex ShutterstockA stage adaptation of Dog Day Afternoon isheading for Broadwaynext year, starringJon BernthalandEbon Moss-Bachrach, both known for their work on The Bear, and directed byRupert Goold. Pacino wishes them well. Why does he think the film, which captures the grit of 1970s New York so entirely, continues to resonate after half a century?“I would say it held up because somehow Lumet got to the humanity of it and the connection of it and the period. It plays more today than it even did then.”Pacino’s recent viewing of the film was on a big screen, which he heartily recommends. But he also enjoys TV – he lovedAdolescenceon Netflix – and has also become addicted to YouTube. “I live for it. It runs the gamut from A to Z. You can see anything you want - everything has been shot and interpreted.”But he is well aware that also means plenty of disinformation. “I saw the other day that I died again,” he laughs. “You see it all the time with celebs. ‘We want to give our condolences.’ Well, I think either I have it wrong or you have it wrong. I seem to be here!”Al Pacino on the inside story of The Godfather: ‘I was told, you’re not cutting it’Read moreMany in Hollywood might observe thatDonald Trumpis contributing to the breakdown of a shared set of facts. Pacino, however, remains tight-lipped as always. “I was never known to talk about politics,” he says. “I know something’s going on that’s a little different but at the same time I don’t go there. I certainly don’t go there in my public life. I just avoided it.”That makes him different from his contemporary and Godfather Part II co-star Robert De Niro, whohaslambastedTrumprepeatedly. Pacino says cheerfully:“He’s his guy. He’s his own person. He feels things and he says them and I think it’s really cool. I love Bob. Bob and I go back forever. He is someone I love.”Redford might be gone but De Niro and Pacino march on. Ripeness is all, as Pacino will presumably say in the upcomingLear Rex, in which he stars withRachel Brosnahan,Jessica Chastain, Ariana DeBose andPeter Dinklage.Still, he has reached an age when it is time to take stock. Last year he published amemoir,Sonny Boy, reflecting on his singular life and career. He jokes that he will speak to the Guardian again to mark the book’s 50th anniversary, which would be 2074.“You’ll be old enough,” he says, amused but with a touch of melancholy. “I won’t be here though. It’s a shame, isn’t it? It’s a shame we have to go away. God only knows: will we have memories when we go away? Memories are so important.”Explore more on these topicsAl PacinoDrama filmsFilm industrySidney LumetRobert De NirointerviewsShareReuse this content"

All remaining Israeli hostages must be released, Starmer added.Downing Street believes that recognition will help to counter some of the criticism it has faced at home, including from in the cabinet and among Labour MPs, over its response to the Gaza crisis, ahead of what is expected to be a politically fraught annual conference.In a video message to the nation, Starmer said: “The hope of a two-state solution is fading but we cannot let that light go out … Today, to revive the hope of peace and a two-state solution, I state clearly, as prime minister of this great country, that the UK formally recognises the state of Palestine.“In the face of the growing horrors in the Middle East we are acting to keep alive the possibility of peace and a two-state solution. That means a safe and secure Israel, alongside a viable Palestinian state. At the moment we have neither.”In an attempt to deal with criticisms of the announcement from the US and Israel, he said: “Let’s be frank, Hamas is a brutal terror organisation. Our call for a genuine two-state solution is the exact opposite of their hateful vision. So we are clear, this solution is not a reward for Hamas, because it means Hamas can have no future, no role in government, no role in security.”But he concluded: “The man-made humanitarian crisis in Gaza reaches new depths. The Israeli government’s relentless and increasing bombardment of Gaza, the offensive of recent weeks, the starvation and devastation are utterly intolerable. Tens of thousands have been killed, including thousands as they tried to collect food and water. This death and destruction horrifies all of us. It must end.”The UK is to recognise a Palestinian state based provisionally on 1967 borders, before Israel occupied the Gaza Strip andWest Bank. It will also pave the way for full diplomatic relations, with the Palestinian head of mission, Husam Zomlot, likely to be upgraded to full ambassadorial status.Zomlot said: “It marks an irreversible step towards justice, peace and the correction of historic wrongs, including Britain’s colonial legacy, the Balfour Declaration and its role in the dispossession of the Palestinian people.”Starmer first announced in July that the UK would recognise Palestine by the time of the UN general assembly, which begins next week, unless Israel abided by a ceasefire and committed to a two-state solution. The prime minister spoke to Netanyahu before the announcement.More than 150 countries, including France, which has led the western response, are expected to have recognised Palestine by the end of next week, although some may set conditions. The United States, now in effect opposed to a two-state solution, has rejected the UK move.Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said: “Further steps, including the establishment of diplomatic relations and the opening of embassies will be considered as the Palestinian Authority makes further progress on commitments to reform.”MapThe Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, said: “Recognising the state of Palestine, led by the Palestinian Authority, empowers those who seek peaceful coexistence and the end of Hamas. This in no way legitimises terrorism, nor is it any reward for it.”The move comes seven decades after the end of the British mandate in Palestine and the formation of the state of Israel, as the death toll from the war on Gaza continues to rise and conditions for the people trapped there become even more desperate.While the announcement is not being portrayed as a punishment of Israel, it is unlikely the step would have been taken if Netanyahu had conducted the military campaign in Gaza with less ferocity and greater regard for international law.Israel’s foreign ministry said it rejected what it called the “one-sided” recognition of a Palestinian state by Britain, Canada and Australia, warning that recognition could further destabilise the region.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No, it won’t, that’s down to humanitarian aid. Will this free hostages? That must be down to a ceasefire,” he told the BBC. “What do we say to the children of a future Palestinian state? Do we say we have to wait for the perfect conditions before we can recognise a Palestinian state?”Starmer had come under pressure from Labour MPs, including about third of his cabinet, to recognise Palestine, because of the moral imperative but also amid concerns that the party would lose votes to the left and pro-Gaza independents over the issue.One cabinet minister told the Guardian: “Symbols matter. The Labour government has placed itself on the right side of history. Everyone knows that recognition alone won’t change the lives of Palestinians, but it is a timely and necessary riposte to an authoritarian Israeli government that has increasingly made Israel a pariah state.“There now needs to be a serious effort to kickstart a peace process and change facts on the ground – or at least to prevent Israel from killing the two-state solution with further West Bank annexations.”Why Britain recognising Palestine matters – podcastRead more‘Not enough in itself’: wary welcome in West Bank over recognition of PalestineRead moreExplore more on these topicsUK newsPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warKeir StarmerWest BanknewsShareReuse this content"

I hate my opponents, and I don’t want the best for them, I’m sorry.”Trump’s speech was an awkward mix of eulogy and campaign speech, during which he frequently veered away from reading somber remarks about Kirk’s life and violent death to make offhand comments and jokes.View image in fullscreenPresident Donald Trump, seen on a stadium screen, speaks at the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Photograph: John Locher/APHe mentioned his use of federal forces to police cities and took a moment to promote an announcement at the White House on Monday. “I think we found an answer to autism. How about that? Autism: tomorrow we are going to be talking in the Oval Office in the White House about autism,” the president said.Trump also claimed Kirk had urged him to dispatch federal troops to Chicago. “One of the last things he said to me was ‘Please sir, save Chicago’. And we’re going to do that, we’re going to save Chicago, from horrible crime.”At the end of his remarks, after calling Erika Kirk back on stage, Trump acted more like he was at a rally than a memorial, mouthing the words to America the Beautiful in a comic manner and swaying side to side.Earlier,Vance eulogized Kirk in explicitly religious terms, calling him “a martyr for the Christian faith”, despite a lack of evidence that his religion played any role in the killing.“They tried to silence my friend Charlie Kirk, but today we speak with Charlie and for Charlie louder than ever,” the vice-president said. “The evil murderer who took Charlie from us expected us to have a funeral today – and instead, my friends, we have had a revival and celebration of Charlie Kirk and of his Lord Jesus Christ.”Vance also argued that Kirk, known for engaging with students, combined the traditions of Socrates and Christianity. “He was Athens and Jerusalem; the city of reason and the city of God in one person”, Vance said.Erika Kirk also stressed what she called the inspiration Kirk’s murder had given to his supporters to embrace Christianity. “After Charlie’s assassination, we didn’t see violence, we didn’t see rioting,” Kirk said, as applause swelled from the crowd, welcoming the implied contrast to the upheaval following the murders of George Floyd or Martin Luther King Jr. “We saw revival,” she said.“This past week, we saw people open a Bible for the first time in a decade,” Kirk said. “We saw people go to a church service for the first time in their entire lives.”“The answer to hate is not hate,” she added. “The answer we know from the Gospel is love, and always love, love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us.”Donald Trump Jr also described Kirk as a martyr. “Charlie joined a long line of courageous men and women who were murdered for what they believe,” he said.Trump Jr recounted traveling with Kirk on college campuses and receiving threats to their safety. “We went out there anyway, without fear. Charlie led the way. His message was clear then, and his message is clear now, we won’t back down,” he said.Stephen Miller, a top White House adviser, pledged to finish Kirk’s life’s work.“You thought you could kill Charlie Kirk,” Miller said. “You have made him immortal. You have immortalized Charlie Kirk, and now millions will carry on his legacy.”“To our enemies. You have nothing to give. You have nothing to offer. You have nothing to share but bitterness. We have beauty. We have light. We have goodness. We have determination. We have vision. We have strength.”The memorial service was being held at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, a 63,000-seat home of the Arizona Cardinals football team and the venue where Taylor Swiftlaunchedher Eras tour.The event mixed political rhetoric with Christian evangelism. Thousands of people wearing red, white and blue poured into the stadium and lines snaked several blocks before sunrise Sunday.View image in fullscreenPeople hold up Turning Point signs as they gather on the day of Charlie Kirk’s memorial service.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersJeffrey Barke, a physician with a large online following, went to the stadium with a group of friends from Orange county, California, on what he called a “pilgrimage of sorts” to honor Kirk’s life and legacy. He pledged to use own platform to aid in spreading “Charlie’s message”.Christina Sawick, wearing a “Trump was right about everything” hat, said she had been watching and listening to Kirk since 2016. On Sunday, she left her home in Mesa at 3am to attend his memorial service.She said she appreciated Kirk’s willingness to debate anyone regardless of their politics or background. “He didn’t sugarcoat anything,” she said. “He just wanted to be heard and he wanted everybody to be heard.”US secretary of state Marco Rubio praised Kirk’s impact on young men. “He sought to engage those he disagreed with, because he understood that we were not created to isolate ourselves from one another, but to engage,” Rubio said.A massive security presence, led by the US Secret Service, was in place, with the eventexpected to receivesecurity on par with the Super Bowl. A man armed with a gun and a knife, with inactive law enforcement credentials and amid claims he was providing private security, wasdetainedon Saturday at the venue.How Trump is seizing on Charlie Kirk’s killing for a campaign of vengeanceRead moreA spokesperson for Kirk’s Turning Point USA organization said the man was doing “advance security for a known guest” but it was not properly coordinated with the Secret Service or Turning Point. The spokesperson also said it was not believed the man was “attempting anything nefarious”.Americans are grappling with the killing and complicated legacy of the 31-year-old conservative “youth whisperer”, Trump ally and podcasting provocateur, who was shot and killed on 10 September in what prosecutors have labeled political violence – and which has deepened fears about the trajectory of a profoundly divided nation.Kirk was struck by a single bullet as he spoke before a crowd of 3,000 mostly college students at Utah Valley University, the first stop on his national “American Comeback” campus tour. Utah prosecutors have charged Tyler Robinson, 22, with capital murder in Kirk’s killing and said they will seek the death penalty.In the wake of Kirk’s death, Trump and his advisers have sought to cast blame on Democrats, even though elected leaders and party officials have uniformly condemned the killing. Officials have said they believe the suspect acted alone.Prosecutors have said they suspect Robinson killed Kirk because he personally had become sick of what he perceived to be Kirk’s “hatred”. But, citing three sources familiar with the investigation into Kirk’s killing, NBCreportedSaturday that federal authorities have not found any link between Robinson and leftwing groups, on which the Trump administration has threatened to crack down after the deadly shooting.View image in fullscreenPeople attend a memorial for Charlie Kirk in Glendale, Arizona, on Sunday.Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APFueled by an outpouring of grief and rage on the right, conservatives are demanding punishment for those who have mocked or disparaged Kirk – a campaign of retribution critics say mirrors the very cancel culture he railed against. Since his death, teachers, students, journalists and the late-night show host Jimmy Kimmel have beenfired, suspended or disciplinedover comments related to Kirk or his death, in a clampdown that free-speech advocates, democracy scholars and others say amounts to government censorship.Explore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingUS politicsUS crimeTrump administrationArizonaDonald TrumpJD VancenewsShareReuse this content"

The Eurofighters took off from the Rostock-Laage airbase to head off the aircraft as it flew in international airspace.Tensions between Nato and Russia have been dramatically rising after a series of what European governments say are deliberate, provocative acts by the Kremlin. On Friday, three Russian MiG-31 fighters violated Estonian airspace in the Gulf of Finland. Moscow denies this.Zelenskyy accuses allies of ‘wasting time’ as he prepares for Trump meetingRead moreAsked if the US was willing to defend EU countries from further Russian aggression, Donald Trump on Sunday said: “Yeah, I would. I would.” Earlier, the US president said he “didn’t like” Russia’s jet incursion but said he had not been briefed about it.Estonia condemned the Kremlin’s “brazen” behaviour. It said it was convening an emergency security council meeting for the first time in 34 years of Estonia’s membership of the UN. World leaders are gathering this week in New York for the UN’s general assembly.Estonian foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, said the violation was “part of a broader pattern of escalation by Russia, both regionally and globally”. It included violations of Polish and Romanian airspace. “This behaviour requires an international response,” Tsahkna said.Tallinn – a staunch supporter of Ukraine – has requested consultations under Nato’s article four, which allows members to meet with allies if their security is threatened. Last week, Poland’s foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, said Moscow wastesting Nato’s reactions with “incremental” hostile steps, short of a full-scale conflict.His comments at a security conference in Kyiv came after 19 Russian drones landed on Polish territory. Over the weekend, a man who was out foraging for mushroomsdiscovered debris from a decoy dronein a forested area, about 1.5km from the village of Sulmice, in Zamość county.Late on Sunday the Russian defence ministry said a Ukrainian drone attack on a resort area in Crimea had killed two people and injured 15.According to Bloomberg, citing Kremlin sources, Vladimir Putin has concluded that the US is unlikely to do much to strengthen Ukraine’s defences after his August summit with Donald Trump in Alaska. Russia intends to step up its attacks to force Kyiv to capitulate, the agency reported.Reports suggest Washington is planning to reduce security assistance to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, which share a border with Russia.Estonia’s defence minister, Hanno Pevkur, said Russian actions were aimed at shifting the west’s focus away fromUkraine. “This is exactly what Russia wants – to divert our attention away from helping Ukraine and to focus on our own back yard. That’s the key goal,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

European governments did not want a wider war but had no choice but to respond, he said.Rinkėvičs added: “Russia is doing just enough to make it seem like it is not going too far. But, knowing both the logic of thinking in Russia and the frequent incompetence at various levels, this [a conflict] could happen. The responsibility will lie with the Kremlin.”The Czech president, Petr Pavel, called onNatoto respond decisively to Russian aggression and to stay united. “Unfortunately, this is balancing on the brink of conflict, but giving in to evil is simply impossible,” he said.Russia, meanwhile, accused the UK on Sunday of being one of the leaders of what it said was a pro-war “camp”. According to the Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, western attempts to pressure Russia would not work or help efforts to end the war in Ukraine.Speaking on Fridaybefore his trip to the UN, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he was ready to hold talks with Putin or to meet him together with Trump. Russia says this can happen only when the “root causes” of the war have been addressed – meaning once Ukraine has surrendered.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropeEstoniaNatoUnited NationsGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

The government is planning to set out its belief that the expansion will be possible without breaching the UK’s carbon budget.A government source said: “The transport secretary has cleared Gatwick expansion for take-off. With capacity constraints holding back business, trade and tourism, this is a no-brainer for growth.“This government has taken unprecedented steps to get this done, navigating a needlessly complex planning system, which our reforms will simplify in future.“It is possible that planes could be taking off from a new full runway at Gatwick before the next general election.“Any airport expansion must be delivered in line with our legally binding climate change commitments and meet strict environmental requirements.”The shadow transport secretary, Richard Holden, welcomed the decision to approve Gatwick’s second runway.He said: “If done with sensible mitigations, it will be a vital step towards driving economic growth, improving connectivity, and strengthening Britain’s position on the global stage. But let’s be clear, this decision should have been made months ago.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Green party leader said: “It ignores basic climate science and risks undermining efforts to tackle the climate crisis.“Labour keeps wheeling out the same nonsense about growth, but at what cost? What this really means is more pollution, more noise for local communities, and no real economic benefit.”Local campaigners opposed to expansion are concerned about the impact on surface transport, noise, housing provision and wastewater treatment, but the airport insists it has conducted “full and thorough assessments” of those issues.Cagne, an umbrella aviation community and environment group for Sussex, Surrey and Kent, said it stood ready to serve a judicial review funded by residents and environmental bodies.The group said: “We know this government cares little for the environmental impact aviation is having on our planet and Gatwick’s neighbours, but not to demand that Gatwick pays for the infrastructure, the onsite wastewater treatment plant, and noise impact is unlawful in our book.”The Stay Grounded campaign said the approval “prioritises the profit of a few at the expense of us all”.Friends of the Earth’s head of campaigns, Rosie Downes, said: “With emissions from aviation rising as climate extremes increasingly batter the planet with more intense floods, droughts and wildfires, it’s a struggle to see how the government can conclude expansion at Gatwick is a wise move.”In July,Heathrow submitted plans for a third runwayas part of a £50bn investment, with the government insisting that expanding Europe’s largest airport could create 100,000 jobs and drive growth.The two-mile (3.2km) runway expansion would cross a diverted M25 and allow more than 750 additional flights a day over London, helping bring the total annual number of passengers to 150 million.Explore more on these topicsGatwick airportAir transportBusiness travelTransportHeidi AlexanderLabournewsShareReuse this content"

We find ourselves in a regrettable situation, but my motivation has always been to ensure the collective strength of our movement, put members first and build the genuinely democratic conference and socialist party we so urgently need.“I am determined to reconcile and move forward. I am engaged in ongoing discussions with Jeremy, for whom, like all socialists of my generation, I have nothing but respect.”On Friday, Sultana said she had instructed “specialist defamation lawyers” after she was “the subject of a number of false and defamatory statements” about her launch of a paid membership system.It came after a message encouraging supporters of the outfit to sign up was disowned as an “unauthorised email” by Corbyn.Sultana said she had taken the step because she had been “sidelined” and “effectively frozen out” by the former Labour leader and fellow independent MPs Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain, Iqbal Mohamed and Shockat Adam.The MP added: “Unfortunately I have been subjected to what can only be described as a sexist boys’ club: I have been treated appallingly and excluded completely.”Corbyn had previously urged people not to use the “supposed membership portal” and said legal advice was being taken over its launch.The row is the latest in a series of disagreements between the two MPs over the direction of the party, which is yet to hold an annual conference or decide on an official name.Sultana announced its launch in July before Corbyn appeared ready to confirm it.But the party appeared to be building momentum, with Sultana claiming more than 750,000 supporters had signed up.Sultana, who was suspended last year alongside six other Labour MPs for voting to scrap the two-child benefit cap, announced in July she was quitting Labour to set up a new political party.Explore more on these topicsZarah SultanaJeremy CorbynnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump administration officials have signaled that a deal for the Chinese-owned social media platform was imminent, though there has beensome confusionabout the status of the agreement.Trump said moguls Larry Ellison and Michael Dell were involved in the deal before adding: “I hate to tell you this – a man named Lachlan is involved. You know who Lachlan is? That’s a very unusual name,Lachlan Murdoch.“Rupert is probably gonna be in the group, I think they’re gonna be in the group, a couple of others. Really great people. Very prominent people. And they’re also American patriots, they love this country, so I think they’re gonna do a really good job.”Such a deal would involve Fox corporation being among the group of investors in TikTok,CNN reportedon Sunday, not Rupert and Lachlan as individual investors.Trump says Xi Jinping has agreed to approve TikTok deal, but details unclearRead moreRepresentatives for Fox – which is owned byRupert Murdochand whose chief executive officer is Lachlan Murdoch – did not immediately return a request for comment. Trump’s comments came after he subjected Rupert Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal to a lawsuit in connection with the outlet’s publication of allegations that the president composed a crude poem and doodle as part of a book compiled for the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th birthday in 2003.Congress passed a law in 2024 banning TikTok, owned for now by the China-based company ByteDance, unless it was sold to a US company, citing national security and privacy concerns. TheTrump administrationhas thwarted that law, extending the deadline for a transfer several times. The app has about 170 million users in the US, and Trump on Sunday credited it with helping him win a second presidency in 2024.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitttold Fox Newson Saturday that six Americans will sit on the company’s seven-seat board – and that data and privacy would be controlled by Oracle, Ellison’s company. The US would also control the app’s data and algorithm in America, according to Leavitt.“This deal does put America first,” Leavitt said on Saturday, invoking one of Trump’s preferred political slogans. “And let me just be very clear.

She disappeared after a night out, and her body was found two months later in the grounds of a hotel where she was last seen drinking with British soldiers.View image in fullscreenRose Wanyua Wanjiku, elder sister of Agnes Wanjiru, holds a photograph of Agnes, who died in 2012.Photograph: Brian Inganga/APWanjiru’s death has already been the focus of several inquests and criminal inquiries, but the latest charges are the first time a suspect has been formally identified in the case.The charge comes after a fresh police investigation, led by detectives in Kenya, which retains jurisdiction in the case. It followed an investigation in 2021 by the Sunday Times newspaper , in which several current and former soldiers in the regiment came forward to name a suspect.Following Tuesday’s court hearing, Purkiss’s name has been circulated widely in the Kenyan media.“We have lived with the pain of Agnes’s death for over a decade,” her family said in a statement earlier this week. “The reports that an arrest warrant has been issued against a UK citizen is a significant moment for us and is incredibly welcome.”No timeline has been set for any extradition hearing or future trial.A government spokesperson did not confirm whether a formal extradition request had been received by the home secretary.“Our thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru and we remain absolutely committed to helping them secure justice,” a UK government spokesperson said.“We understand that the Kenyan director of public prosecutions has determined that a British national should face trial in relation to the murder of Ms Wanjiru in 2012. This is subject to ongoing legal proceedings and we will not comment further at this stage.”The case is next listed for mention in court in Kenya on 21 October.Explore more on these topicsUK newsKenyanewsShareReuse this content"

Mikel Arteta had started with the dial turned towards caution but, by the time the board went up to show seven minutes of stoppage time, the manager had torn off the handbrake, sending on attacking substitutes, praying that one of his finishers could come up trumps.It was attack versus defence, as it had been throughout, but now it was a ridiculously extreme version. Pep Guardiola had everybody back, hisManchester Cityteam set up in a 5-4-1 formation, desperately holding on to the advantage given to them by Erling Haaland in the ninth minute.Arsenal 1-1 Manchester City: Premier League player ratingsRead moreThe breakthrough seemed to have come in a different age, Haaland running through to finish for his seventh City goal in six appearances this season. Thereafter, his team defended. And they defended some more. It was a war of attrition. Guardiola withdrew Phil Foden, he withdrew Haaland. He introduced more defensive players. Was it really him?City finished with 32.8% of the possession; the lowest number for a Guardiola team in 601 top-flight games. They looked leggy, which was unsurprising given they had played in the Champions Leagueat home to Napolion Thursday night. Arsenal had theirEuropean fixture at Athletic Bilbaoin a Tuesday tea-time kick-off. One question: why did Guardiola name an unchanged side?City looked set to stagger over the line; the hardest-fought of three points were within their grasp. Then Arsenal made it happen. Arteta’s team looked to have run out of ideas. But when one substitute, Eberechi Eze, saw another, Gabriel Martinelli, begin a run in behind the City backline, his lob was made to measure.Martinelli’s finish was outstanding. The first touch was true and, with the outside of his right boot, he managed the not insignificant feat of lifting the ball up and over Gianluigi Donnarumma and down into the far corner. Cue joy, relief, bedlam; the full heady cocktail for Arsenal. Arteta’s celebrations were arguably the wildest.It was not the result that Arsenal wanted and it was hard not to see the league leaders, Liverpool, as the biggest beneficiaries. Even when they are not scoring the last-gasp goals themselves, they are working for them. But for Arteta and Arsenal, it was at least something.Arteta had gone with another of his midfield muscle lineups. In the injury-enforced absence of Martin Ødegaard, he did not try Eze in the No 10 role at the outset; rather he went for Mikel Merino. He also preferred Leandro Trossard to Eze on the left. There were echoes of the approach in the 1-0defeat at Liverpoolat the end of August. The plan for solidity would be hit hard early on.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland resists doing a Zen celebration after scoring.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesArsenal brought the press, with Gabriel Magalhães tight to Haaland in a congested central space midway inside the City half. But the striker’s solution was to turn the ball up and around the corner to send Tijjani Reijnders racing upfield. Arsenal were exposed and Haaland did not hang around to admire his work. He eased up through the gears to give Reijnders an option to the right of centre and, when the pass was played, the weight on it just right, the finish was a formality.City were initially 4-4-2 out of possession, Bernardo Silva alongside Haaland, and Arsenal’s challenge was to navigate through the thick blue lines. They forced a handful of first-half corners and there were flickers from Noni Madueke on the right. But what could they look back on at the interval in terms of chances? Their only real one followed a drop of the shoulder by Madueke and a blast for the near corner. Donnarumma repelled it with a mighty paw.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also brought on Bukayo Saka, who was back in the squad after a hamstring injury, for Madueke. There was a more positive energy about Arsenal upon the restart; inside the stadium, too. It was not that City were penned back more. They could hardly get any deeper. It was that Arsenal had greater urgency. Saka was in the mood. Martín Zubimendi shot high from the edge of the area. Eze thumped a half-volley at Donnarumma.City almost landed the counterpunch in the 57th minute, Haaland barrelling up the inside left onto a Jérémy Doku pass and he had Foden square for the tap-in. Haaland took on the shot and David Raya saved. But really, the question concerned whether City could hold firm.Guardiola sent on Nathan Aké for Foden on 68 minutes and went to the back five. The next eyebrow-raiser was Nico González for Haaland in the 76th minute, Doku going into the No 9 position. It was so unusual to see Guardiola play this way, to sacrifice the aesthetic. The result was all that mattered.Arteta went through agonies in his technical area because it was so difficult for his players to find any spaces. After the burst at the start of the second half, it descended into a slog. Frustration replaced optimism in the stands.Arteta sent on Martinelli for Jurriën Timber and went to a back three. He also got Ethan Nwaneri on as an extra central attacking midfielder. The system was 3-2-4-1; in other words, all or nothing. Martinelli had made the difference off the bench in Bilbao, scoring one and setting up the other in the 2-0 win. Here, he was the match-saver.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The children were allegedly playing football in a prohibited area, “creating a disturbance to the public peace and a danger for people in transit”, according to the official notice given to the parents and published in the Italian press.Antonio Trampus, the father of one of the children, toldLa Stampa: “My son called me in tears. The police wouldn’t listen to reason. They could have called us parents and asked us to take our children home. Instead, they immediately took their names and addresses.”The fine could rise to as much as €500 if not paid within 60 days. “But we will not pay,” said Trampus, adding that the group was planning to appeal and take the matter up with the mayor of Venice, Luigi Brugnaro.The fines were enforced based on regulations introduced in 2019 banning ball games in certain areas of Venice. In Murano, the only square where the game is permitted is San Bernardo. But the parents argue that Pino Signoretto square was never included in the list of banned areas as it was only recently created after the neighbourhood was redeveloped.“San Bernardo is not suitable,” said Trampus. “Whereas the other square is. Removing the children there would mean returning it to the state it was in before.”The case sparked debate in Venice, with local councillor Marco Gasparinetti arguing that the police intervention was disproportionate and questioning the priorities in a citygrappling with overtourism, pickpockets and a dwindling local population.Referring to the parents being summoned to the police station, Gasparinetti wrote on Facebook: “Were they scammers? Pickpockets? Drug dealers? No, they were the parents of [14] children.”Gasparinetti added that it should have been enough to take the ball away and tell the children to stop playing. “Wouldn’t that have been more educational? Common sense and a sense of priority were lacking.”Corriere del Venetoreported that the children might have been penalised due to their age, because areas where ball games are permitted are exclusive to children under 11.Paolo Poggi, a retired professional footballer who was born in Venice, also contributed to the debate. “Long live children who spend time outdoors,” he toldLa Nuova Venezianewspaper. “The rules are sacrosanct, but common sense is needed. Children’s play experience must be preserved.”Explore more on these topicsItalyChildrenEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Theannouncementfollowed mounting pressure on Keir Starmer from within the Labour party and beyond.1.How will the decision be met within the Labour party?TheHamas attackson Israel on 7 October 2023 were met with horror across the British political spectrum. Yet soon after, concern began to mount around the scale of Israel’s response. As the death toll rose, and the situation on the ground in Gaza worsened, internal pressure on Starmer increased.The government had disappointed many on its own side by saying recognition would happen only as part of a negotiated peace deal. By July this year, more than 100 Labour MPs had signed a cross-party letter, led by the Rotherham MP Sarah Champion, calling for the government to formally acknowledge Palestine immediately.As global outcry grew, the Guardian revealed that cabinet ministers were alsoprivately urging the prime minister to act. They included his then deputy, Angela Rayner, and the now foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, told MPs he wanted recognition “while there’s still a state of Palestine left to recognise”.Starmer’s announcement will be met with widespread relief inside the Labour party. Recognition of a Palestinian state has long been a Labour manifesto promise. There is a widely held view that while largely symbolic, it is important to do. That said, there are more than a handful of Labour MPs on the right of the party who will be concerned that it could damage relations with key strategic allies, notably the US, without changing anything on the ground in Gaza.But as well as the moral imperative to act, the government also had a political one. Labour lost four seats at last year’s general election to pro-Palestinian candidates amid dissatisfaction over the party’s stance on Gaza – and the issue was cited as one of the main reasons why voters were abandoning the party for the Greens and leftwing independents.2.Will it be enough for the left?Probably not. While recognition was considered essential by many Labour MPs, it was also seen as just one step. Both within the party and without, there are demands for the government to go even further – on sanctions, arms, trade and war crimes.UK, Canada and Australia announce formal recognition of Palestine, with wave of Israel’s allies to followRead moreGovernment advisers are defensive, citing what the UK has already done to hold Israel to account since Labour came to power. They point to the UKrestoring fundingto the UN agency Unrwa,sanctioning far-right Israeli ministersandthose who committedsettler violence,breaking off trade negotiationswith Israel, backing thelegitimacy of the international criminal court,restricting arms licencesto Israel (though not preventing them entirely) andstepping up humanitarian aidto Gaza.Starmer’s failure to – publicly at least – condemn Israel’s latest ground offensive while standing alongside Donald Trump at Chequers left many wondering whether he had even privately urged the US president to use his power over the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to bring an end to the conflict, or to put his full political might behind ceasefire talks.Political movements to the left of Labour welcomed Palestinian self-determination, but want the government to do more.Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader who is now forming his own leftwing political movement, said: “Next, the UK should recognise the genocide in Gaza, end its complicity in crimes against humanity, and stop arming Israel.”The new Green party leader, Zack Polanski, said on X: “There won’t be a Palestinian state left if government’s continue enabling Israel’s unfolding genocide. Labour can’t credibly support Palestinian statehood whilst also continuing to arm Israel.”3.Will it help secure Starmer’s position?Downing Street insiders hope that Starmer’s move will help keep the wolves inside the Labour party at bay. The prime minister was under intense pressure from at least 100 Labour MPs and around a third of his cabinet to recognise the Palestinian state.Primarily, because they felt the situation on the ground in Gaza was so desperate. But also because it was urgent politically, after Labour lost four seats to pro-Gaza independents at the general election, with the threat of more to come, including, potentially, cabinet ministers Wes Streeting and Shabana Mahmood.It also helps take the heat out of the issue before the party’s conference in Liverpool next week, although Labour members and MPs would like to see the government go further by ceasing all arms trade with Israel and withdrawing military cooperation.While recognition on its own will by no means solve Starmer’s problems, and may create more tension on the international stage with Donald Trump opposing the move, it will at least prove to some of his internal critics that he is willing to listen to their concerns – and more than that, to act.4.What about the wider UK?Thousands of people across the UK have taken part in pro-Palestine marches since the start of the conflict, calling for recognition and an immediate ceasefire – suggesting there is widespread unease around the country over the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza. In the social media age, videos of the horrors on the ground have circulated widely.The marches have taken on an added complexity since the governmentproscribed Palestine Actionas a terrorist organisation despite concerns that the move could risk criminalising legitimate protest.Starmer’s decision to formally acknowledge Palestine will be a popular one. Pollsters YouGov found that public support for the move continued to significantly outweigh opposition, with44% backing it, while only 18% disagreed – with 37% unsure. The same polling found that 38% sympathised more with the Palestinian side, 12% with Israel, 17% with both sides equally – and 32% didn’t know.Labour insiders hope this could further solidify Starmer’s reputation for performing well on the international stage – despite the high stakes involved – although the domestic picture is far bleaker for the prime minister.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsPalestinian territoriesGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaLabournewsShareReuse this content"

If your measures are not good enough yet, put that on your risk assessment.”Delegates, some drinking free champagne provided by conference sponsors, asked anxious questions. What if a company could not afford to install age verification? How big would the fines be? Could sites avoid having to comply by blocking UK traffic? WasOfcomaware that rival site owners might be trying to sabotage competitors’ businesses by tipping off the regulator about non-compliance?View image in fullscreenA presentation by Ofcom at the Wyndham Diplomat hotel in Prague, Czech Republic.Photograph: Photographer: Bjoern Steinz/Björn Steinz/Panos Pictures“We exist to help you,” another Ofcom regulator said to the audience of about 50 men and seven women. “It’s hard. There are many, many things you need to know, but we exist to help members of the adult industry with compliance.”Seven weeks since the introduction of the Online Safety Act, Ofcom’s regulators want to tell a positive story about the pornography industry’s response to the legislation. All of the top 10 and most of the top 100 adult sites have either introduced age checks or blocked UK access, they said; social media sites that allow pornographic content, such as X and Reddit, have also deployed age assurance. There were 7.5m visits to the top five age verification sites in August, up from 1m in June.The regulators like to cast the 27 July introduction of age verification as the industry’s seatbelt moment, referring to it as AV Day, a moment that would decisively shut off children’s access to pornography in the UK. The reality has been more complicated.View image in fullscreenAn Ofcom screen at the Prague conference.Photograph: Photographer: Bjoern Steinz/Björn Steinz/Panos PicturesIn the days after the legislation was launched, there was an immediate sharp spike in the number of downloads of VPNs, which allow users to mask their geographical location, and circumvent age verification requests.“The rollout has been fairly disastrous,” Mike Stabile, the director of public policy from the Free Speech Coalition, which represents the adult entertainment in the US, said. He said that traffic had moved from compliant to non-compliant sites. “VPNs have surged; people have not been compliant; we’re seeing traffic go to pirate sites … I don’t think Ofcom would look at this and say: ‘This is what we wanted.’”Corey Silverstein, an American lawyer who represents a number of adult industry companies and who has unsuccessfully challenged the introduction of age verification legislation in several US states, said there was considerable hostility to the regulators. “People are very professional and very polite, but this isn’t the friendliest audience. Some people steer very clear of them. You can see it must be uncomfortable for them walking into a trade show like this.”But he gave a presentation advising pornography site owners that they would have to swallow their animosity toward the regulators and work with Ofcom to implement the new regulations.“Their goal is not to cut your legs off. They smile and they’re very nice. They’re not trying to kill you,” he said. “My understanding is they’re actually not even looking to financially fine you. They just want to push you in the right direction for compliance.”The Ofcom officials, wearing smartly ironed white shirts, worked steadily against a background noise of steels drums, handing out questionnaires printed on A4 paper, as a troupe of dancers in feathered leotards performed for delegates, and sponsors handed out cocktails.The form (on paper to allow sites the protection of anonymity) asked delegates to state whether they had adopted age verification in the UK and asked companies that were not yet compliant, to explain why they had done nothing. By Saturday evening, one Ofcom official said not too many delegates had agreed to fill in the forms, but they were hopeful that Sunday might see more responses.No site has yet been fined under the Online Safety Act, but Ofcom has opened 12 investigations into pornographic services, covering more than 60 sites and apps.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there was some grudging acknowledgment of Ofcom’s willingness to attend industry events and speak to people.“In the US, people really don’t want to talk to us,” Alex Kekesi, Pornhub’s vice-president of brand and community, said. “We appreciate that Ofcom has invited us to have a seat at the table. We’re often not included in conversations that have to do with regulating our industry.”In advance of 27 July, Ofcom established a Porn Portfolio team, made up of six compliance officers, working on persuading companies to adhere to the rules. Members of this team (who asked for their names and images not to be released for safeguarding reasons) have attended similar conferences in Berlin, Amsterdam and LA. A separate enforcement team of more than 40 staff members works on investigating those organisations that fail to comply.“We are very conscious of the size of the sector and the ease with which anybody can set up a service that shares pornographic content,” one of the regulators said. “We’re not saying that we are going to manage to get every single service into compliance. The approach we take is targeting our resources on those areas where the most children are at most risk of harm.” Penalties, when they are imposed, will be designed to have a deterrent effect; sites can be find up to £18m or 10% of global worldwide revenue.“Companies can choose to not comply and take the risk that we will come after them and find them. We want enforcement to change that balance of incentives, so they think it’s just not worth taking the risk,” the Ofcom official said.Another Ofcom employee rejected the argument that soaring VPN downloads meant the legislation had failed, arguing that the legislation was primarily aimed at preventing children from accidentally stumbling over pornographic material (rather than preventing those who were deliberating seeking out pornography from finding it).As well as contending with new age verification requirements, pornography site owners were also grappling with how to moderate AI-generated content, to ensure users aren’t allowed to create the kind of violent and illegal material that would attract Ofcom’s attention and trigger companies like Visa and Mastercard to stop processing their payments. Sites and apps that offer AI-generated pornography are also regulated by the act.“From a compliance perspective, how can you tell the difference between a 15-year-old AI model and an 18- or 19-year-old AI model?” one delegate asked, uncertain about how to prevent users from encouraging AI to create illegal child sexual abuse material.Steve Jones, who runs an AI porn site, said they had to train their AI systems to understand what was unacceptable. “We say your creation has to be at least 5ft tall, can’t be completely flat-chested and we ban things like pigtails and braces and all the childish toys and teddy bears and things like that,” he said. “AI doesn’t understand the difference between an adult woman that looks young and a young girl. We have to teach it. The AI itself has no morals and no ethics.”Explore more on these topicsPornographyOfcomInternet safetyChild protectionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But as the evidence about the Covid “VIP lane” affair is collated by this cool, clear investigation, “biggest misspending scandal of all time” starts to look like an understatement.When the Covid-19 pandemic hit the UK in the early months of 2020, doctors and nurses urgently required large amounts of personal protective equipment (PPE): the disposable masks, goggles and gowns that would allow them to treat an infectious disease without contracting it themselves. Our impoverished NHS did not own adequate stockpiles of PPE, so the Conservative government of the day set about buying it in. It appealed for companies that were not part of the regular NHS supply chain to pitch their services.So far, so good. But the UK also set up something that neighbouring countries didn’t have: a VIP lane. Applications that were recommended or passed on by persons deemed to be important – often senior Conservative party politicians – were given special treatment. This film cites internal emails stating that “[the] VIP route is for MPs who can make life painful and shout loudly”, and that such inquiries were to be funnelled to an inbox named “Covid-PPE-priority-appraisals”. As a leaked briefing document put it: “Opportunities from high-profile people require a rapid response.”Many of the companies that applied via the VIP lane were very swiftly given colossal sums of money to provide PPE. Even this favouritism – towards firms run by well-connected types who could contact people in power directly – might not have been so bad, had they been established PPE suppliers. But often they had no track record in the field. Several had only just been incorporated. We hear from a veteran PPE supplier who says his applications to the government were ignored, to the point that he resorted to the inefficient alternative of selling directly to individual NHS trusts. Friends of the Tories were given national contracts, worth tens or hundreds of millions of pounds, within weeks.One of the main defences used by MPs and lords who forwarded applications is that they didn’t decide whether their associates were actually awarded contracts, but Follow the Money makes it clear that they didn’t need to: a guiding principle had been established. There is strong evidence here that companies coming through the VIP lane got faster responses, were more likely to be approved, and enjoyed larger profit margins – often about 50% to 60%. They were also more likely to supply poor-quality PPE that was unusable.(To what extent particular companies did this is the subject of legal disputes and is thus not specified here, but the programme identifies an overall trend of VIP PPE being more likely to fail.)Follow the Money is mostly a repackaging of existing reporting, but producers/directors Jenna Weiler and Davina Bristow perform that task with calm rigour. It interviews numerous campaigners – from the Good Law Project’s Jolyon Maugham to Susan Hawley, the executive director of Spotlight on Corruption – as well as journalists. As a result, the programme effectively becomes a collaboration between investigators who would normally work alone for different outlets, and whose diligence has thus, up to now, not received the attention it deserved. It pools their knowledge and adds original reporting to complete a devastating picture.And then, just when you start to conclude that this PPE supply scandal is one of the most heinous of your lifetime … it gets worse. As the focus moved from treatment to containment, the government needed millions of those white oblong tests that once ruled all our lives. Guess what? The VIP lane opened again, with similar results. Meanwhile, British ports were clogged with containers full of PPE, because as well as paying more per unit than other countries, Britain had ordered far too many units. Some companies that had won contracts to supply PPE were later employed to dispose of it. We see a clip from the ongoingCovid inquiry, in which former health secretary Matt Hancock speaks with his trademark tone of maddeningly blase self-congratulation: asked about the several billion pounds’ worth of useless surplus PPE, he says: “We over-succeeded.”Follow the Money is of course careful to include statements from the accused, with the companies saying that they fulfilled the terms of their contracts faithfully, and ministers and MPs saying that in the teeth of a unique crisis, they had to get PPE by any means available. Watching this programme, however, forces us to at least consider something that is almost too disgusting to contemplate: that when our country faced one of its darkest hours, certain people in charge saw not a crisis, but an opportunity.Covid Contracts: Follow the Money aired on ITV1 and is on ITVXExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionCoronavirusCovid inquiryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now they’ve reconnected as pop-rock foes, with the “rivalry” – both bands were formed by the same management company, with McFly arriving three years after Busted in 2003 – cemented by an opening video segment based on Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet that pits them as “star crossed bands” living in “fair Britannia”. Millennial couples in rival Team Busted and Team McFly T-shirts, meanwhile, eye each other up nervously.A surprisingly buff McFly open proceedings, anchoring their rock credentials with 2023’s Where Did All the Guitars Go?, an embarrassing “real music” diatribe about the “shit” on the radio. But while there are some other duds in their 12 song set – Red is a Kidz Bop version of U2; the faux-breezy pop of Happiness falls into that “shit” category – they also have a handful of top-tier bops (Obviously, All About You, a raucous One For the Radio), and enough musical variety, to keep even the patient Busted fans happy.As McFly’s colourful visuals start to pixelate and fracture at the end of their set, they’re replaced by the teenage punk iconography of a depleted Busted, reduced to a duo after James Bourne pulled out of the tour due to illness. Bourne’s goofy presence is instantly missed as Charlie Simpson and Matt Willis earnestly try to contort time-stamped teenage anthems such as Dawson’s Geek, Britney and What I Go To School For into Serious Rock poses. A lovely Sleeping With the Light On – dedicated to Bourne – is a highlight, however, as is a surprisingly ferocious Thunderbirds Are Go, which Simpson delivers as if fronting Turnstile.Kept apart for over 90 minutes the bands start to inch closer: Willis and McFly bassist Dougie Poynter appear in opposite audience gangways to sling insults at each other (Willis suggests Poynter smells like cheese and has herpes), before the more sensible Simpson and Danny Jones croon their way through Busted’s 3am and McFly’s Not Alone. It’s only during the encore that the bands fuse together, tearing through Shine a Light and Year 3000 with an infectious energy missing from parts of what’s gone before.In this rock-tinged boyband battle royale, while acknowledging a bloodied and bruised Busted, victory just about goes to a still intact McFly.Touring until 8 NovemberExplore more on these topicsMusicMcFlyPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Both had just produced, in rapid succession, three defining masterpieces which would ensure their immortality – in Verdi’s case Rigoletto, Il Trovatore and La Traviata, in Dylan’s the trilogy of albums starting withBringing It All Back Home. The question that now loomed was – where to go from here?For Verdi, as for Rossini and Donizetti before him, the answer was Paris, and the conquest (and financial rewards) of French opera. The outcome wasThe Sicilian Vespers, a five act grand opera in French, complete with ballet, depicting the Sicilian rising against French invaders in 1282. It is a work of uncommon musical fascination, in which Verdi subjects his art to a form of self-renewal in something of the manner that Dylan would also do more than a century later. The score, much admired by Berlioz, is full of new forms of declamation and controlled grandeur. But it has never held a position in the repertoire to compare with its predecessors.Stefan Herheim’s Covent Garden production of Sicilian Vespers in 2013, now revived by Dan Dooner, was the Royal Opera’s very first. Herheim’s treatment has lashings of his characteristically bold theatrical panache. He sets it, not in 13th century Sicily as Verdi prescribed, but in the Paris opera’sLe Peletier theatreat the time of the work’s premiere. Ballerinas, boulevardiers and Balzacien low-lifes abound. All this is superimposed on the opera’s original plot in ways that can be hard to follow. Franco-Italian tensions fill the stage, as they do the score, though mercifully the 30-minute ballet in act three is cut. At the end, though, this production’s hollowness and ambiguities leave us hanging.View image in fullscreenBallerinas, boulevardiers and Balzacien low-lifes … The Sicilian Vespers.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianNone of that is down toSperanza Scappucciin the pit, who makes an impressive debut as the Royal Opera’s principal guest conductor, the first woman to hold the post. From the overture onwards – in which events preceding the opera itself are acted out on stage – Scappucci conducts a well-paced account, allowing Verdi’s explorations of rhythm and tonality to flower, and she is attentive both to the composer’s new orchestral colours and to her singers.In a new cast of principals,Joyce El-Khouryas Hélène is at her best in the soft and reflective duets with her lover Henri in act four, but only intermittently vocally comfortable in the main body of the role’s more forceful demands. The Ukrainian tenorValentyn Dytiukbrings stentorian ardour to all of Henri’s big moments. Most convincing of all is the bass-baritoneQuinn Kelseyas the conflicted French governor Montfort, who is also Henri’s father, and who gets to explore the father-son relationship in music of dark inwardness, expressively sung.Ildebrando D’Arcangelogets the opera’s best known aria, “Et toi, Palerme”, sung to what may be a backcloth of Etna in eruption. But even he cannot make much of Herheim’s disjunctive conception of Jean Procida as simultaneously an implacable Sicilian patriot and a dandyish Parisian ballet-master.At theRoyal Opera House, London, until 6 OctoberExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicGiuseppe VerdiRoyal Opera HousereviewsShareReuse this content"

I was flying back to France from the UK after a friend’s funeral. I’d been living in Paris doing a French-language course and living with a host family who, to be honest, weren’t particularly welcoming.It was late at night when I got back to the apartment, only to find the entrance code to the building had changed – something the host family had neglected to mention. They must have already been in bed, because nobody was answering my calls. Short of throwing rocks at the fourth-floor window to wake them up, I had no way of getting inside.I was stuck wandering around Paris with my suitcase, wondering what to do now. I rang my girlfriend back in the UK to ask if she might be able to book me a hotel online – this was before smartphones. She had a look, but everywhere was €350 a night or more, which was crazy money for a young student and absolutely out of my budget.The kindness of strangers: we broke down in the outback and a retired mechanic came to our rescueRead moreAt this point I was feeling stuck, hopeless – and quite hungry. I wandered over to a McDonald’s and the staff there clearly realised something was not going well for me, so they offered me a couple of burgers for free as they were closing up.I wandered over to sit on a bench and eat my Big Macs when a guy came over to me and started speaking in broken French. He clearly wasn’t a local, so I switched to English and, sure enough, he was a Brit just like me. He asked me for directions to the McDonald’s and I told him it was just down the road, but that he was out of luck as they had just closed for the night.He started walking away but I yelled out that they’d given me more food than I could eat, if he would like one of my burgers?He accepted my offer and sat down on the park bench to eat with me. We got chatting and I told him my story about not being able to get into my apartment, while he told me he was an executive at a big bank, here on a work-funded trip. He said: “Don’t take this as a weird offer or anything, but I can see you’re in a tight spot – do you want to sleep on my hotel room floor?”I was a little hesitant and initially declined. But chewing over the fact that I had nowhere else to go, I called my girlfriend for advice. She had a conversation with this man over the phone and we decided the safer course of action was to take up the offer, rather than spend the night on the street. He slept in the bed, and I slept on the floor of his five-star hotel, which was actually quite comfortable.That man rescued me from unfortunate circumstances and I came away reminded that people can be good to each other. All he gained from that offer was the knowledge that he’d helped someone else. And a free burger, I suppose – but he was going to get that anyway.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceFrom making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Later photograph: Simon Webb/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Grooming: Alice Theobald at Arlington Artists. Archive image: BBC/Matt SquireBorn in Stockport in 1976, Will Mellor is an actor known for his role as Jambo in Hollyoaks and a decade-long run in Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps. His co-star in the latter show was Ralf Little, born in 1980 in Oldham, who starred in The Royle Family before joining the sitcom in 2001. Mellor has since appeared inMr Bates vs the Post Office, Line of Duty and Broadchurch, while Little has been in Inside No 9, Doctor Who and Death in Paradise. The pair host theTwo Pints podcast, and the second series of Will & Ralf Should Know Better airs from 29 September on U&Dave.RalfThis was taken in a pub called the Archer in the fictional Two Pints universe. We were portraying twentysomethings who didn’t have prospects or social mobility, but were quite happy with their lot. As a result, there’s a slight world-weariness and ennui to our facial expressions. We were probably channelling the aloof rock stars from the 90s we loved and those photoshoots where nobody ever smiled.The first time I met Will was in 1997. I was friends with the guy who played Max Cunningham in Hollyoaks and he took me along to a Halloween party in Liverpool where the rest of the cast would be. No one knew me from Adam – I’d filmedThe Royle Family, but it hadn’t come out yet. I turned up dressed as Batman. The Men in Black song came on, and suddenly I was standing next to Will, who had come as Bram Stoker’s Dracula and was the only other person at the party who knew the choreography. Afterwards, I thought: “That was fun – but I’ll probably never see you again.”A few years later we met at the read-through for Two Pints. He remembered dancing with Batman, and told me he loved The Royle Family. Then he said: “I’m off to get a cup of tea.” I thought: “What a charming bloke.” Two minutes later he returned, unbeknown to me having put his finger up his bum. He said: “Hey, smell that”, and shoved it under my nose. An inauspicious yet oddly effective start to a 20-year relationship.The 2000s were heady, exciting days. We had a great time, but often Will would be surprisingly sensibleDespite how disgusting Will could be, we were thick as thieves. We were never the sort of mates who popped round each other’s houses, but our work schedule meant we were inseparable. The 2000s were heady, exciting days: we would rehearse from Monday to Thursday, shoot on Friday in front of a live audience, then all go out on a Friday night.We had a great time, but often Will would be surprisingly sensible. He had been raised to be a tough, rough man and he knew if he kept drinking there might be some kind of trouble, and he didn’t want a fight so he’d take himself home. He might pretend to be daft, but he is a very smart, self-aware man. In the last five years, I’ve noticed him become even more thoughtful and considered. He’s been through a lot and he’s about to turn 50. All of that has made him reflect on his life and who he is in a really beautiful way.When Two Pints ended, we didn’t make a conscious effort to stay in touch, but we didn’t not stay in touch. I think that’s my relationship with most people: I can go for months without speaking to my mates. I give the impression of being incredibly forthcoming while actually not revealing anything. It could be a defence mechanism, I’m not sure. You’d have to ask my therapist. Will, meanwhile, is the opposite. He is completely open.We’ve both spent our lives pretending to be other people – on and off screen. In our 20s we were driven by the mindset that nothing mattered, and acted like everything was a joke, a bit of fun. Which it was, to an extent. Now, there are fewer knob gags and there’s less messing around. Don’t get me wrong, we don’t avoid that entirely. But there is a lot more depth to us than before.WillI realised quickly that Ralf was an annoying twat. It was like having a little brother. A fly you couldn’t kill. One that really made me laugh.Because of our shared sense of humour, it was hard doing scenes together – especially when filming in front of the live audience. It was like being at school, when you know you’ll get told off if you crack up but that just makes everything even funnier. The crew would say: “If we don’t get this scene, we’re going to run over time, and we can’t do that, so boys, PLEASE!” I’d look at Ralf and he’d be laughing so hard there was snot coming out of his nose and tears falling from his eyes. Once, we had to make him physically leave the set so we could get a shot done. Even though he was in the scene.Those days were some of the best of my life. I’d left Hollyoaks and had a bit of a music career. There was no pressure or responsibilities. There were pints, too – sometimes even during rehearsals. Then, after the recording on Fridays, we’d go clubbing. The hangovers weren’t even that bad.In the last few years, my sister, and my dad have died. Grief has changed everythingWhen we shot the last scene of Two Pints, I cried. I couldn’t help it.

I hadn’t started losing people yet. In the last few years, my sister and my dad have died. Grief changed everything. I realised there’s a vulnerability to life. Having kids has made me very protective and emotional, too. It’s a good thing. I’m a bloke from a council estate, and it took me a while to learn that it’s OK to not be OK.Compared with Ralf, I am a lot more in touch with my emotions. But we work well together: Ralf is a lot calmer under stress and I’m all over the place. I’m up and down and vocalise every single thing I see and think. I get angry quickly. Ralf can chill me out, and I can help him talk.Of course, over the years we’ve fallen out. You can’t be friends with somebody unless you’ve had a few rows. For a while I think we were rivals for the limelight, fighting for attention, but not any more.Coronation Street’s Katherine Kelly looks back: ‘My friends were very accepting of me being a bit different’Read moreA few years ago, Susan Nickson, who created Two Pints, wrote a first draft of an episode called Two Pints: Last Orders. It was brilliant. We pitched it to the BBC and they said no. Which is strange, because it’s still popular and nostalgia is big business.That’s the thing about that show: although it was huge, there was so much snobbery about it. At its peak, the British Comedy awards didn’t include it in the best sitcom longlist.The press didn’t like us, either. While it was frustrating, it helped the show. We had a cult following – this massive working-class audience. The more the papers put us down, the more fans jumped on board.When this photo was taken, the whole of our lives were in front of us. It was exciting and unknown. That’s a feeling I am determined to recreate, because I’m scared of getting older. I hate the fact I’m ageing and that time flies so fast.From now on, my goal is to try new things, make memories and continue to laugh too much with Ralf.Explore more on these topicsFriendshipFlashbackTelevisionRalf LittlePhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When you factor in their parents and carers, it highlights the huge number of people who anxiously watch this area of policy. All of them know that the systems those kids depend on are dysfunctional and broken. And they are also keenly aware of something else: that whereas their experiences once tended to be ignored and overlooked, they have now crossed from the online world into Radio 4’sWoman’s Hour,The One Show, Good Morning Britain and all the rest, as a huge conversation about the politics of all this gets louder and louder.Beyond the worsening Send crisis itself, there are obvious reasons for that: months of anonymous briefings and rumours, and the prospect ofa legislative white paperthat, we are told, will finally arrive at some unspecified point “in the autumn”. At the department for education, Bridget Phillipson – the secretary of state who is also running to beLabour’s deputy leader– says she wants many more children to be included in mainstream schools, and is aiming at a system that is more “timely, more effective, and actually maximises support”. In the vaguest of ways, that might sound reasonable enough, but there have also been rumblings that have caused many Send families no end of concern.Which brings us toanother big figure. Around 640,000 children and young people with Send currently have an education, health and care plan (endless acronyms are an in-built part of the special needs universe – these are known as EHCPs). These documents are the responsibility of local authorities and, in theory, they set out the specific help and support individual kids need as a matter of legally enforceable rights: their numbers have gone up in recent years chiefly because, in an endlessly squeezed school system, they are often the only way of securing dependable help.Getting an EHCP is usually a grinding struggle, and making sure the provision they set out actually materialises can entail the same kind of fight. But for parents and carers whose lives are often a mess of unreturned phone calls and emails, along with theofficial Send tribunal, they represent a precious means of accountability. Moreover, if the kind of dedicated help they provide and its foundation in law were either diluted or done away with, many kids’ inclusion in mainstream schools would be impossible (I speak from experience here: my son is autistic andhas an EHCP, and without it, the productive years he spent in mainstream schools would have been unthinkable). Even if the government’s Send reforms start to work, that will remain the case for a long time to come.Supporting kids with Send is expensive. But the cost of not doing so is far greater | Carrie GrantRead moreLate last year, whispers from the top of governmentbegan to circulate, about drastically restricting the number of EHCPs. Ministers, meanwhile, have refused to be drawn on whether or not EHCPs and the very clear rights they enshrine will survive their reforms at all. The current line is that there will always be “a legal right to extra support”for Send kids. But that could mean very different things: either a continuation of EHCPs and the needs-based rights they provide, or a fairly meaningless guarantee that kids will be legally entitled to whatever the state decides it can offer. Among parents and Send professionals, the result has been a mixture of queasy anxiety and increasing frustration.Last week, two big developments showed that similar feelings are now spreading through Westminster. The first happened on Monday, when a huge crowd of Send familiesgathered outside parliamentfor a lunchtime protest addressed by – among others – the Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey, while inside MPsprepared for a debateabout the Send crisis, and the prospect of big changes to the system. Thanks to Rachel Filmer, a parent from Poole who is one of the prime movers in the newSave Our Children’s Rightscampaign (full disclosure: I am also involved),a petitionopposing any moves on families’ legal entitlements had surpassed 100,000 signatures – which led on toa three-hour session in Westminster Hall. Ninety MPs were there, the kind of turnout that speaks volumes about how hot these issues have become.It was fascinating to watch: one of those occasions when MPs talk about the human stories contained in their casework, and depart from the usual pre-written party lines. OneLabourMP said that many of his constituents wanted “reassurance regarding education, health and care plans. They do not want them to be scrapped; they would like a personalised plan, such as the EHCP, to remain in the reformed system.” Another asked the government to confirm that “legal protections will be in place for those families who so desperately need that support”. Lib Dems, Greens and Tories voiced the same opinions – and, even among the more on-message Labour MPs present, beyond one or two veiled hints, there were no arguments for either restricting or getting rid of EHCPs.View image in fullscreenLiberal Democrat party leader Ed Davey speaks to protesters outside parliament on 15 September 2025.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockThree days later came a real watershed moment:the publication of a reportfrom the Commons’ education select committee, which has been immersed in an exhaustive inquiry into the Send crisis for the last eight months. Though it says that the current need and demand for EHCPs is “unsustainable”, it insists – entirely correctly – that the solution to that problem lies in doggedly improving ordinary, everyday support, not taking rights away and leaving children stranded.Whatever the government’s answer to the Send crisis, the report says: “The solution cannot be to remove the statutory entitlements from a system which lacks accountability in many other areas and in which parents already have so little trust and confidence … The Send reforms must not be based on any withdrawal of statutory entitlements for children and young people with Send.” Those words do not need much translating.One BBC headlinecrisply summed them up as, “Don’t scrap care plans for children with special educational needs, say MPs”. The Labour chair of the committee, Helen Hayes,was almost as blunt: “There should be no reduction in that entitlement and no raising of the threshold for that entitlement.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThere is a new element of the politics of special needs education, which centres on a party that could not muster a single MP for the Westminster Hall debate, but was mentioned several times. Back in the spring, with his usual blithe disregard for the complexities of the real world, the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said that the NHS was“massively overdiagnosing”special needs and disabilities. Early this month, Richard Tice, the party’s deputy leader,said that Send spendingwas “being hijacked by far too many parents who are abusing the system, taking it for a ride”. These are the blowhards and know-nothings who may yet move from local to national government: they do not seem to have given any thought to the idea that to make that leap, millions of Send parents and their friends and families will be among the voters they will need.For now, as that white paper approaches, I am more interested in what Reform’s poisonous banalities might mean for the balance of opinion among other MPs, and Labour people in particular. It feels as if there is a mounting realisation in Westminster that existing Send rights increasingly look like a precious wall of defence against the cruelty that would be let loose if Reform took national power. And I increasingly sense something else: a rising aversion to standing anywhere near anyone who believes in the modern myths of “overdiagnosis” or the idea that changes to the Send system ought to start with snatching away rights and entitlements.I would like to think the same sentiments have surfaced in the education department. In only a matter of weeks, we will see. But in the meantime, for millions of people all too used to silence and slow service, the wait goes on.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsOpinionBridget PhillipsonChildrenLabourAutismcommentShareReuse this content"

On the surface, it is about flags, identity and political allegiance. But to me, as an American living in Britain, recent events reveal something deeper: both our societies are normalising hate ​and othering in ways that corrode not only our politics but our souls.The something is aggressions and micro-aggressions: a coarsening of everyday encounters. I have snapshots. Recently, at a celebrated creative hub in London, I twice endured blatant bias. My guests and I – the only all-Black table in the room – were left in the dark, literally. As night fell, every other table was given a lamp except ours. When I raised it with management, I was interrupted, dismissed and told it was an oversight. A Black staff member was sent to smooth things over​. An official later told me that while they had “a different view of what happened”, they accepted that this was “how [I] experienced it” and admitted it “fell short of [their] usual standards”. My Blackness was overlooked, diminished and dismissed – while whiteness was appreciated, affirmed and celebrated, in a space that loudly markets itself as a home of “belonging”.​The pendulum has swung back. Much more overt aggression is normalised in a way I haven’t seen in years. Recently in US airports and restaurants, I ​have been called the N-word: a word ​historically intended not ​just to insult, but to erase.These are not minor indignities. They are signs of a culture where suspicion and prejudice are no longer whispered but weaponised. In Colorado, three students were critically wounded after a school shooting. In Minnesota, political leaders were among those targeted in a mass attack by an assailant who compiled a sprawling “hitlist” of dozens of Democrats, though investigators noted he appeared to hold few consistent or coherent ideological beliefs. In Sweden, 10 students and staff members were killed in a tragic attack at an adult education centre in Örebro – a case in whichpolice confirmed“there was nothing … to suggest he had acted on ideological grounds”. Here in Britain, far-right activity and asylum seeker protests have surged, fuelled by a combination of inflammatory rhetoric and relative silence from political leaders.What unites these threads is not ideology but a deficit of empathy. And without empathy, democracies falter.Martin Luther King Jr warned:“Let no man pull you so low as to hate him.”Hatred, he knew, corrodes the hater as much as the hated. Love, by contrast, is the only force capable of transforming both. This is not abstract philosophy. It is lived truth.And the message of Jesus Christ was never about defending doctrines or drawing boundaries of purity. It was a message of radical love – love that crossed lines, embraced the despised and saw the soul beyond the sin. That is the love the world is starving for today.Rabbi Jonathan Sacks made the same case in his 2015 bookNot in God’s Name: “We are all children of Abraham … God is calling us, Jew, Christian and Muslim, to let go of hate and the preaching of hate, and live at last as brothers and sisters … honouring God’s name by honouring his image, humankind.” His challenge was theological, yes, but also civic. Societies cannot thrive if they are built on grievance. Empathy must become a public practice woven into our schools, workplaces and laws. Politicians who thrive on division should be held accountable not only for what they say but for the cultures of cruelty they foster.Even in the US, where free speech is sacrosanct, presidents have acknowledged, rhetorically at least, that liberty cannot mean licence. “We must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry, and violence,”the Trump White House once declared. That statement should apply to every American citizen – bar none – and to every society that claims to be democratic.From Britain’s protests to the US’s violence, public theatre often drowns out deeper questions. The real issue is not which side shouts louder, but whether societies can still summon empathy in an age addicted to division. Free speech is vital for democracy – but without empathy and responsibility, it becomes a blunt instrument that wounds the vulnerable while shielding the powerful.Here in Britain, empathy would mean confronting racism where it hides in plain sight: in private clubs that celebrate whiteness while ignoring Blackness, and in everyday encounters where bias is excused as banter. It would mean reshaping our politics so grievance is not weaponised but grace is prioritised.This is not about sentimentality. Empathy is not naivety. It is an act of moral courage. It means refusing to define people solely by their worst moments. It means seeing the soul in the person across from us – even when their words wound.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I do not feel hatred. Hatred corrodes the soul. Outrage, when held rightly, becomes the fuel for truth-telling – for refusing to allow dignity to be diminished or injustice to be normalised. My hope is that even in the face of such ugliness, we can build a society where empathy does the work that hate once claimed: binding us together, not tearing us apart.What is the endgame in this toxic immigration debate: is it friends and neighbours thrown out of the country? | Jonthan LiewRead moreI think often of my son. He is growing up in a world more toxic than the one I inherited. He will face choices about whether to meet cruelty with cruelty or to answer it with love. What I want him to know; what I want us all to know, is that empathy is not weakness. It is strength. It is the refusal to let hate dictate who we are. In the end, it is the only inheritance worth leaving behind.I think, too, of another child:Charlie Kirk’s son in the US. One will grow up without his father; my own will grow up watching what that boy’s father stood for. Two boys, oceans apart, but inheriting the same question: will we break the cycle of hate? My prayer is that, in different ways, both will come to know this: the only way forward, the only way to heal what is broken, is love.Keith Magee is a theologian and author, andchairs the Guardian FoundationDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But lifting has paid off for me in surprising ways – and shown I can change my life dramaticallySun 21 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 21 Sep 2025 16.40 EDTShareIoccasionally do self-improvement stuff for work –fell-running,Hula-Hooping,getting up early– and despite sincerely appreciating some of it, and saying I’ll keep it up, I never do. Until a year ago, when I went to a gym to write aboutlifting heavy weights. This was, to say the least, surprising. I have never enjoyed exercise: I hated it at school, and worked out in my 20s only as an adjunct to an eating disorder. Since then, I’ve mostly walked and done bits of pilates as a dull but necessary investment in my spine. I’ve always been sedentary, a stranger to endorphins.For some reason, though, I finished writing about lifting heavy weights, shut my laptop and went straight to the gym to lift more. Since then, I have gone three times every week, come rain, shine orStorm Éowyn. Here’s the good, the bad and the ugly from my surprise year of lifting.It sucks you in …There’s an internal momentum to weightlifting: progress is quantifiable, incremental and happens when you persevere with no need for natural aptitude. You get better just by showing up, and that’s what keeps me coming. But this is good and bad. We had one of those rare, perfect autumn mornings of golden sun the other day, but I spent much of it in a grey, stale-smelling, artificially lit hangar where they were playing the worst crimes of Capital FM, lifting lumps of metal. I was hoping to get a personal best I could brag about here, but didn’t. This did not feel like the sanest choice.…but it also demands you stopThere’s a lot to love about an activity in which sitting and scrolling (resting between sets of weights) is essential, and which requires rest and regular days off for success. Exercise that values its opposite so fervently feels special.The lifting community is low-key inspiringAt my local authority gym, I occasionally chat with (or eavesdrop on) other lifters. It’s astonishing how many are quietly showing up with chronic health conditions and pain, after gruelling double shifts, or bearing heavy caring responsibilities. If they can do it, surely I, with my easy job and functioning body, can too.You can bear anything for six reps …A lifelong giver-up, I now tell myself this often, and it’s true. I even apply it to other parts of my life occasionally.View image in fullscreenI showed up! I tried! And that’s fine!Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian…but failing is fineTechnically speaking, to “lift to failure” (reach the limit of your capability) can be good forbuilding muscle. But emotionally, intellectually, I’ve discovered the gym is also the one place I’m fine with failing. When I mess up, drop a dumbbell or fall over (all regular occurrences), I truly feel it doesn’t matter. I showed up! I tried! I have honestly never felt like this in any other context.It’s a bit cringey …“Reps”, “traps”, “delts”, “gains” – all that bro-y weightlifting terminology feels silly in my middle-aged mouth. Even so, it has unlocked a new language for talking, albeit a bit shamefacedly, to my “swole” sons, and I love lifting for that.And it hasn’t rewired me …So much weightlifting philosophy feels positive: I read evangelical accounts of how it has transformed women’s attitudes to food, movement and body shape. But there’s plenty of punitive, prescriptive, thunderingly self-absorbed and vapid stuff out there too. People love telling you what you’re doing wrong; why your diet’s bad; why you aren’t getting #gains. I’m not immune to this stuff and I haven’t been magically rewired by picking up a barbell to take simple delight in my body (I wish).…but ithas shown me change is (still) possibleLifting is famously good for middle-aged women, for our bones, muscles and mood. But it’s been even more powerful, and beneficial, to realise I’m still mutable. I’ve watched my body change gradually (calluses on my palms, extra heft around my shoulders) and acquired skills (I’ve doubled how much I can deadlift; more usefully, I carried a printer the size of a Renault Clio upstairs without disaster yesterday). But even better, lifting has unlocked a sense of possibility. Something that felt fundamental to my personality changed dramatically in months – maybe other things might?

My partner and I have spent many nights agonising over career directions, what investments to make and how to map out our next 10, even 20 years.How lucky am I to do so in this age? Never before have we lived in an era with more information, analysis and hot takes.

Finding joy in others. It’s free, simple and will gladden your heart | Nadine LevyRead moreYou might get a rude shock from the Daodejing. The relatively short Chinese philosophy text is credited to the great master Laozi (who probably didn’t exist). The way of life portrayed in it, Daoism (or Taoism), isn’t a religion in the way of temples and rituals, but more in the way of a philosophy. Living in tune with the natural order is at its heart.The Daodejing is more than 2,000 years old and likely from the warring states period of Chinese history. Its more than 5,000 characters sum up in poetic verse how to live in accordance with “the way’ (the Dao) and its virtues (the De).But if you hope this might read like any other self-help book, you better hold on to your sticky notes.Take its first par:The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.The name that can be named is not the eternal name.You could dismiss this as philosophical gobbledegook, but that’s perhaps the point. I’m not going to even explain it to you. Do your job! You may yell back at me. But its inscrutability is its power.

What’s the best thing to say? What words mean what? We spend our time optimising and maxxing all aspects of our lives into aesthetic colour-coded calendars.Thanks to social media, we are more perceived and judged than ever before. Not only are weafraid of embarrassmentbut we are also afraid of being misunderstood and taken out of context. We worry over every word and image to ensure we are expressing ourselves correctly.But the Daodejing shows through contradictions the limitations of words and language:Nothing in all beneath heaven is so soft and weak as water.And yet, for conquering the hard and strong, nothing succeeds like water.And nothing can change it:weak overcoming strong,soft overcoming hard.This is not to say we should all live our life passively without thinking. But I have found living life clutching to absolute ideas and truths to be tiring. In Daoism, this go-with-the-the flow attitude is calledwuwei, and is often translated as effortless action.In explaining this to you, I have given you my biases and prejudices. My idea of what these words mean. My words contain ideas beyond containing. The universe is inherently contradictory: water nurtures yet it drowns, the sun cultivates yet it burns. How can simple words convey what is meant to be experienced with all five senses? I’m unsure of an existence beyond my own cognition.

But I’m also hoping that gas turbines can also contribute.”That would be in direct conflict with the government’s determination to wean the UK off gas, as part of the transition to net zero.What is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?Read moreThe multibillion-dollar tech agreement, signed to coincide with the flummery of Donald Trump’s visit, involves welcoming a slew of vast new energy-hungry datacentres, built by US companies. (The term datacentreoccurs 14 times in the official release.)Demand for these digital warehouses has rocketed with the adoption of generative artificial intelligence, which requires vast volumes of data to train its models.Appearing recently on comedian Theo Von’s podcast, Sam Altman, the chief executive of the ChatGPT creator, OpenAI,mused: “I do guess that a lot of the world gets covered in datacentres over time,” – before blithely suggesting: “Maybe we put them in space.”Ministers’ determination to roll out the red carpet for US tech is understandable, given Labour’s urgent need for economic growth and the drive to improve public sector productivity, but it has come with little or no public discussion about potential downsides.That is particularly worrying given the stranglehold over these technologies of a small number of ultra-powerful American companies, with no reason to stick with the UK if the bubble bursts.Nick Clegg, who, as a former “president of global affairs” at Meta, knows something about selling out to Silicon Valley,called the US-UK deal“just another version of the United Kingdom holding on to Uncle Sam’s coat-tails”.A paper published last yearby sustainability experts from MITwarned that the “unfettered growth” of generative AI, while having clear benefits for particular sectors, also “incurs significant costs”.The authors, led by MIT’s Noman Bashir, called for what they described as “the frenetic pace of development akin to a Klondike gold rush” to be replaced by “a more deliberate, thoughtful approach that considers long-term environmental impacts and societal needs”.The International Energy Agency is expecting electricity consumption by the world’s datacentres to more than double between 2024 and 2030, to 945 terawatt hours – equivalent to the current demand of Japan.Anotherrecent paperfound that as generative AI models become larger and more sophisticated they use dramatically more energy – up to 4,600 times more than simpler models. Calling for “coordinated efforts across the AI value chain”, to tackle the environmental impacts of the technology, the authors warn that rapid adoption of AI could lead to a 24-fold increase in the sector’s electricity use.Alongside the US-UK tech deal was an agreement on nuclear cooperation, which Labour hopes will lead to a series of small modular reactors being built – some of which could help to meet datacentres’ voracious needs. However, even under the accelerated timetable for construction envisaged in the deal, these are likely to take years to arrive.Researchcarried outfor the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero paints a relatively reassuring picture, by comparing energy usage by datacentres to an analogue counterfactual: a translation task to the use of a human translator, for example. However, it is far from clear as yet that the use of AI is reducing the demand for other sources of energy demand.Rapid adoption of the technology is coinciding with increasing demand for electricity, as petrol cars give way to electric, and the government tries to persuade households to switch from gas boilers to heat pumps.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the UK the Environment Agency, which was already warning about a future water shortfall for homes and farming, recently conceded the rapid expansion of AI hadmade it impossible to forecast future demand.Researchcarried out by Googlefound that fulfilling a typical prompt entered into its AI assistant Gemini consumed the equivalent of five drops of water – as well as energy equivalent to watching nine seconds of TV.That may be a small cost for oiling the wheels of a once-in-a-century productivity breakthrough. However, even its most optimistic cheerleaders concede that the economic benefits of generative AI may take quite some time to materialise.Meanwhile, evidence is mounting of some of the social costs of what amounts to a mass human experiment.In the UK a paperfrom the Social Market Foundation thinktanklast week warned that the increasing use of chatbots can erode pupils’ cognitive skills – and urged the government to tighten guidelines for schools about their use.Even more alarmingly, OpenAI recently said it wouldinstall “stronger guardrails”after heartbroken US parents claimed their son Adam Raine killed himself after “months of encouragement” from ChatGPT.Their harrowing story echoes wider concerns aboutthe role of chatbots in mental health crises, and a more diffuse worry about the impact of a tsunami of AI slop on public debate.None of this is to deny the technology’s potential benefits, from drug discovery to coding.However, the reality of its energy thirstiness, together with increasingly clear social costs, demands a more clear-eyed look at the trade-offs involved than has so far been evident in Labour’s breathless embrace of the tech giants.Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorEconomics viewpointArtificial intelligence (AI)LabourEnergy industryGasNvidiaChatGPTcommentShareReuse this content"

I am as guilty as they comeSun 21 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 21 Sep 2025 10.52 EDTShareThere are some small details that tell you everything you need to know about who a person really is. How they vote. If they give a nod of thanks to drivers who have stopped for them at pedestrian crossings. Whether they have a cat or a dog.So it is unsurprising that a nationwide survey has discovered that more than half of British people lie about what they watch on television. A conclusive 54% owned up to “exaggerating, fabricating or downplaying” their TV truth, pretending to be into documentaries, crime thrillers and historical biopics to sound “smarter”, “cooler” or “more in the know”.Hard relate.I am – gulp – a Real Housewives superfan. If you don’t know what that means, you have permission to feel extremely smug – it’s an American reality franchise following the rollercoaster lives of ludicrously wealthy women. Think EastEnders but in mansions, and they aren’t actors (technically). I started with the one set in New York and it proved to be a gateway drug for every US city spin-off produced so far. A London version has recently launched. (The jury is out, but also hasn’t missed a single episode.)Being a Real Housewives obsessive is a lonely life. Doggers somehow manage to find each other, but we Real Housewives fans are too ashamed to out ourselves in public, so I don’t know anybody else who partakes. These shows are the very definition of a guilty pleasure.Once an acquaintance told me a sad story about her brother cutting off the whole family after their father died, and I replied that I thought this was quite common because I had a friend in the same situation, and began detailing it. Halfway through a sentence, I had the horrifying realisation that it wasn’t a friend this had happened to, it was a character on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills spin-off Vanderpump Rules. And not even one I liked!That’s how deeply I have absorbed the Bravo channel multiverse into my soul. I’ve known some of the individuals on these series for more than a decade, laughed at and with them, cried with and for them, been by their sides for the most momentous moments of human existence. I’m not naive enough to believe reality TV is completely real: obviously producers are, shall we say, nudging the narrative now and then, but even the most desperate (to be on the next season) Housewife can’t fake deaths, divorce, infertility or imprisonment.There are some brave ambassadors out there, unmasking themselves and making the rest of us a little less embarrassed about our proclivity. John Oliver has waxed evangelical about The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City on fellow late-night host Stephen Colbert’s programme. “It is a masterpiece, it is prestige television. Think of a show that you like in your head right now – it’s better than that show,” he said. “They’re both intentionally funny and unintentionally funny, they’re self-aware and they’re not … It’s incredible telly, it’s a rich text.”Other unexpected admirers of the oeuvre include the respected actor Brenda Fricker (“It’s better than sex. It’s better than getting drunk. I just love it.”) and Michelle Obama (“[My family] razz me about my love of reality TV and the Real Housewives. I watch it all – all of it.”).Most Bravoholics are more covert – apart from atBravoCon, a three-day event where fans congregate and let their freak flags fly in a safe space. At the most recent extravaganza, 35,000 of them descended on Las Vegas to meet 160 stars, or “Bravolebs”, if you speak the lingo. Presumably after bonding for life while they were there, they would ignore each other in the street if they passed by the week after, like the Freemasons, but extra mortified.Funnily enough, the reason that some enjoy Real Housewives is exactly why they hide it. “People really like judging other people. It’s that simple,” Andy Cohen, the legendary executive producer and reunion host, toldthe Hollywood Reporter.“There’s a moral aspect to this – you see people behaving well or behaving badly. People like to sit in judgment and watch people get their reward or comeuppance.”Prison, revenge porn and blush-pink villas: your ultimate guide to the Real Housewives franchiseRead moreAlmost needless to say, the reality of my reality secret – and of all those who lie about the small-screen entertainment they are consuming – is that everybody is far too busy worrying about what others might think of what they are watching to think anything about what anyone else is watching.If the calibre of famous enthusiasts has made you even slightly Real Housewives-curious, there are rules. As Oliver instructed Colbert: “Go back to the start. Go back to season one. You wouldn’t tell someone: ‘If you want to read Lord of the Rings it’s fine to jump in on page 604.’”Of course you wouldn’t – because you wouldn’t have that conversation. As if anybody would admit to another human being that they were geeky enough to be interested in Lord of the Rings.Polly Hudson is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionOpinionUS televisionReality TVcommentShareReuse this content"

But a host of issues, from housing to mental health, is getting in the waySun 21 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 21 Sep 2025 09.46 EDTShare“Why aren’t women having babies?” It’s the question on everyone’s lips as the fertility rateplummets to a record lowin England, Scotland and Wales. A range of answers are always trotted out, from the entirely reasonable (childcare and housing costs; the motherhood career penalty) to the ludicrous (being so dim about our own fertility that we wake up one day realising we’ve left it too late). Yet perhaps it’s time we ask not only “why aren’t women having babies?”, but also “why aren’t men?”Men are largely invisible in the birthrate debate. It’s ironic that amid all the pontificating and the policy ideas for encouraging more women to have babies – a conversation often being had by men – the other half of humanity is strikingly underexamined. Part of the problem is an absence of data: like many European countries, we don’t really have any on male fertility. Without data, we only have half the picture.So what do we know? Well, we know what isdriving the birthrate crisisis not really people having fewer children, but far fewer people becoming parents at all. As the demographer Stephen J Shaw recently wrote, childlessness is on the rise despite the fact that most people still say that they want children. He highlighted how unplanned childlessness – or involuntary infertility – could often be down to simply not being able to find the right partner. This makes sense in light of what is being termed a “relationship recession” or a “mating gap”. People are simply not coupling up like they used to.The anxiety-inducing statistic Shaw cites is that a British woman who reached the age of 28 without children in 2023 had only a 50% chance of becoming a mother. What he doesn’t ask is this: if most women still want to have children, what is happening to suitable, willing male partners as people enter their late 20s and 30s?Dr Joe Strong, a demographer and fellow at Queen Mary University of London, tells me that male-female couples tend to be closer in age than ever before, and that university-educated men are also postponing having children. “Evidence from among men and women in relationships shows that a major reason for delaying childbirth is waiting until both people are ready,” he says. “Decisions aren’t made in a vacuum; men’s postponement of childbirth is tied up with the huge economic and social obstacles that women face.”This echoed feelings raised by the men I have spoken to. Of those who were in couples and wanted children (there were a few who simply didn’t), waiting until a female partner was ready, or had established her career, had been a major factor, as was getting on the property ladder. Of those who were single, it was about finding someone who you’re sure you want to do it with in a dating culture that doesn’t always feel conducive to that goal.Tom, in his late thirties, wanted kids with his ex, whom he was with for several years, but she didn’t want children with him. Now that he’s single, he speaks not of a “biological clock” (although men do actually have one of those, too) but of a “psychological clock”. “You don’t have an infinite amount of time to get to know someone well enough to know really in your heart of hearts whether you want to spend the rest of your life raising a child [with them]”, he tells me.Then there’s the economics of it. Tom is on universal credit after losing his job. “Is it even possible, logistically, financially to have a child any more? It doesn’t feel like it for me. It doesn’t feel like it’s ever going to be in the near future,” he says. He couldn’t afford the housing or childcare needed to raise a child in the city, and moving away would mean being isolated from the community of friends and family that everyone needs when they become a parent.Strong notes that “increasing labour market precarity means it is harder for men to fulfil social expectations of being able to ‘provide’ for families.” It used to be far easier to launch yourself into the adult world: housing and living costs were more affordable, jobs were often plentiful. Having a child at, say, 25, when you’d been living independently since the age of 18, perhaps felt more normal than it does now, and certainly more doable when you didn’t need two incomes to sustain housing costs. If you’re still living with your parents, or in a shared house and suffering from crushing depression, having babies is unlikely to be on your mind, especially if you can barely afford to go out for a drink.On top of economic circumstances, though, has been a fundamental shift in how we have come to see having a child. What used to be a “cornerstone” life event – something that you did as you entered adult life – is now a “capstone” one, meaning something you do when you’ve ticked off all those other life goals. Except ticking them off feels harder and harder.“There is no one size fits all explanation for men’s fertility decisions,” Strong points out. “Decisions on whether and when to have children vary enormously across contexts and demographic groups.” This is a nuanced conversation that requires nuanced solutions. We need to know more about all the factors influencing male fertility and the birthrate, from modern dating culture and porn to housing, the male mental health crisis and cannabis use. If you’re in your 20s or 30s, you’ll probably be having these conversations with people all the time. I know that I am. It makes their absence from the discourse all the more striking.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionChildrenWomenMenFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

They must be the beginning of a renewed effortSun 21 Sep 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 21 Sep 2025 21.30 EDTShareDeath rains down on Gaza City. Starvation stalks the north of Gaza. Israel has now killedmore than 65,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians.The prospects of even a ceasefire look dim, never mind a long-term settlement. Butformally announcingthe UK’s recognition of a Palestinian state on Sunday, Sir Keir Starmer remarked: “The hope of a two-state solution is fading but we cannot let that light go out.” Canada and Australia announced recognition too ahead of the United Nations summit in New York on Monday, in a wave spearheaded by France.Britain’shistorical responsibilitiesmake recognition particularly necessary. It remains wholly insufficient. Not only was the UK dragged to this point; unlike others, it made the announcement conditional. The prime ministerstatedthat it would happen unless Israel agreed to a ceasefire and other terms, which Benjamin Netanyahu’s government was never going to meet. In doing so, he wrongly presented statehood as a bargaining chip – instead of clearly declaring the inalienable right of Palestinians to self-determination.The mass diplomatic shift is symbolic; the US will continue to block full Palestinian membership of the UN. At best, this is part of aconcerted effortto end the war, revive the longer-term prospects for statehood and prevent ethnic cleansing. The UN general assemblyoverwhelmingly backed a motioncalling for a two-state solution earlier this month.The more cynical reckoning is that governments are scrambling to appease domestic anger at their complicity, and avoiding more substantive steps. Israel looksmore isolatedby the day. While the Trump administration appears unshiftable, public support in the US toois plummeting. A detailed UN report has found thatIsrael is committing genocidein Gaza. Yet only two weeks ago, British ministerssaidthat the UK had not reached that conclusion.Mr Netanyahu, who calls recognition a “reward” for terror, suggests that Israel could become an autarkic “super-Sparta” and pursues an endless war. Israeliswant him to stop. But after the Hamas atrocities of 7 October 2023,only 21%believe that Israel and a Palestinian state could coexist peacefully.Palestinianscan put limited faith in such a prospect after the last two years – but the alternative looks like further annexation and expulsion.The two-state solution has been on life support for years, savaged daily by Israeli settlers with official encouragement. The assault on Gaza and its people appears designed to bury it. Donald Trump, who could end this war with a phone call, refused Palestinian delegatesthe visas they neededto attend the general assembly. Emmanuel Macron and others still hope to convince him that his dream of a Nobel-winning grand Middle Eastern deal cannot be realised without progress for Palestinians.The EU, Israel’s largest trading partner, has real leverage. The Commission has finallyurged the suspension of free tradebut, as yet, even more modest plans to suspend research grants have not been agreed. Britain and European states must end all arms transfers and military cooperation, cut trade privileges and pursue international accountability.Promoting a mirage of a Palestinian state without taking meaningful action to halt the annihilation would be cruel, cowardly and self-serving. But while ending the killing must be the priority, the destination cannot be simply stopping Palestinian deaths. It must be establishing the opportunities for life and nationhood that should have been ensured long ago.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

One offering was more audacious than the rest: six vases of jasperware, the blue and white pottery created by Wedgwood. China may have invented porcelain, but Josiah Wedgwood of Stoke-on-Trent created a transnational pottery empire, whose story was synonymous with commerce, colonialism and the formation of British identity.More recently, Wedgwood’s challenges have mirrored those ofBritish manufacturing. The business boomed in the mid 20th century, and by 1986 it employed about 12,000 people worldwide. Many were based in Stoke-on-Trent, where Wedgwood’s “paintresses” trained young apprentices to create curling floral designs. Today, Staffordshire’s potteries face an existential crisis. Four ceramics firms have gone bust or shifted production overseas in the last two years. Last week, the Fiskars Group, Wedgwood’s parent company, announced that it waspausing production for 90 days, putting 70 workers on temporary leave.Fiskars has said that this is merely a “short-term measure” caused by a lull in demand. But Wedgwood’s challenges are longstanding. As Tristram Hunt noted in his 2021biography of Josiah Wedgwood, executives began a debt-fuelled acquisition spree in the 1990s, paying themselves handsomely while laying off more than a thousand staff. They outsourced much of Wedgwood’s manufacturing to Tangerang, Indonesia, in the mid-2000s. While Tangerang enjoyed a $25m investment, Stoke-on-Trent haemorrhaged jobs to workers who were paid just an eighth of the wage of British employees.Prevailing wisdom holds that businesses can’t compete without outsourcing labour to cheaper locations. Wedgwood shows the opposite can be true. Relocating manufacturing overseas helped destroy the brand’s heritage value: “made in Indonesia” did not have the same ring (particularly for customers in Asian markets) as “made in England”. The success ofBurleighand Emma Bridgewater, both of which still make pottery in Stoke, demonstrates that people value authenticity and are willing to pay for it.In 2009, Wedgwood fell intoadministrationand its remaining assets were acquired by a US private equity firm. Fiskars, the Finnish group that has owned Wedgwood since 2015, has been a more stable steward, investing in a tourist destination, World of Wedgwood, in Staffordshire. Nonetheless, much of Wedgwood’s pottery is still made overseas, and in 2019 the companycut 103 jobs. Further redundancies in Stoke would be a blow to artisanal craft skills and to one of the remaining pillars of the Staffordshire potteries.The former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane recently criticised thegovernment’s “arid” approach to growthand urged it to pay more attention to the “opportunities of workers in the everyday economy”. This, surely, is the type of story he had in mind. Labour’sindustrial strategywas a small step in the right direction that promised to slash the electricity bills of many businesses. But it did little to confront the culture of short-term profits that precipitated Wedgwood’s challenges, and its bill reduction won’t come into effect until 2027. Ceramics workers have called for moreimmediate helpwith gas prices; none has been forthcoming. Wedgwood’s pottery is a reminder of the skills that Labour should be trying to protect.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I find the distortion of my faith, which centres on justice, peace, reconciliation and compassion, as misused by extreme rightwing groups to foster racism, division, hate and fear, to be absolutely nauseating.I wonder how these people would receive the real Jesus as a person, whose whole life and work crossed boundaries, reached out to and healed broken people, taught people to love even their enemies, challenged power and ended up dying an ignominious death as an executed criminal.The Christian message has often been corrupted by power-hungry manipulators through the centuries, but ordinary Christian people like me remain steadfast in working for peace, trying to love even our enemies, and crossing boundaries to seek fellowship withallpeople of good will, of every faith and none.I hope and expect that leaders of every Christian denomination and community will challenge the divisiveness of using the symbol of the cross as a weapon to foster hate and fear. Maybe it’s time the college of bishops made a bit more noise.Anne DobbingSt John’s Town of Dalry, Dumfries and GallowayI share the abhorrence of the use of Christian symbols by far‑right activists who gathered in London recently. It is frankly nauseating to see the signs of God’s love being weaponised in this manner. Those who will not welcome the stranger, who demonise the vulnerable, and who stoke fear and call for violence, demonstrate little understanding of the Christ whose prayer they claim to recite. Many Christian leaders have said that publicly. Many preachers will have pointed out that Christian nationalism is an oxymoron.A key to unlocking a better future and countering hatred is to be found in practical acts of love. It is found in the churches where those seeking asylum are welcomed, offered support, and treated as human beings. It is found in the churches, which, through listening to those in their congregations or communities who feel threatened because of the colour of their skin, have committed to learning how to be anti-racist and to standing in solidarity with other faith communities. It is found in churches which recognise the deprivation and despair felt in their localities and throw open their premises as warm spaces, food banks or community larders, and then work alongside community members to advocate for policy change.Yes, church leaders need to speak out, but the priority for many churches in this moment is to support the weak. In that way, the true meaning of the cross of Christ is revealed.Rev Dr Jonathan HustlerSecretary, Methodist ConferenceI hope that liberal Christians will indeed want to contest the political beliefs of Christian nationalists such as those who rallied in London, as your editorial encourages them to do. But it is less clear that insisting as they do so that they hold the “true” Christian principles is very helpful for the rest of us in the non-Christian majority.Much more helpful is for all people of good will in our country, whatever their religious or non-religious beliefs, to unite around shared values of freedom, justice, and human rights. When we come together around shared values we do not need to argue theological truths, and a great source of needless division is removed.Andrew CopsonChief executive, Humanists UKHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It’s his toxic influence on British domestic politics enabled by Keir Starmer.Our chameleon-like prime minister takes on the colours of whichever powerful person he meets. In this instance, xenophobia, racism and the tech bro politics ofDonald Trump.

How is any government supposed to counter it?, 14 September).Your report of the nationalist rally in London the previous day estimated the numbers present at 110,000. As someone who attended the capital’s three largest demonstrations –against South African apartheidin 1985,against the Iraq warin 2003 (1.5 million), and for asecond referendumon EU membership in 2019 (around 1 million) – I can testify that extra-parliamentary mobilisation on the left has always been far stronger.Trouble is, Keir Starmer and his ministers have cut themselves off from such support by taking the opposite stance on every significant issue that sparks it. There is a vacancy for a progressive government that would confront present-day apartheid inIsrael(and stop sending it weapons), start to disengage Britain from the project to prolong US primacy through constant wars, and point us unambiguously towards rejoining the EU sooner rather than later. It would draw strength from the principled, progressive majority in the country rather than constantly antagonising, betraying and disappointing it.Jake LynchAssociate professor, The University of SydneyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It’s by far one of the best teams in Europe. I would prefer to play another way, but when we play a lot of games in 10 years [as City manager], the teams defend deep, deep, deep and take a result of fantastic performance, mindset, strategy … Sometimes it happens. You have to defend, honestly. It’s because the opponent is better. When you have to accept it, you have to survive in that way. And we did it.”Asked about the possession statistics, he said: “One time in 10 years is not bad, right? I have to prove myself against another strategy. Now I am a transition team.”Having finished as runners-up for the past three seasons, Arsenal are five points behind Liverpool, the league leaders, after five games. Arteta refused to accept criticism over his decision to select Mikel Merino ahead of Eberechi Eze after the England forward came off the bench at half-time and set up the equaliser. But he recognised that service must improve to Viktor Gyökeres, after the new £55m striker did not register a shot during the match.“To have very big open chances is extremely difficult, but he’s certainly trying his best and trying to do that, and we have to provide more for him,” Arteta said. “There were a lot of situations when the chances were there and then especially the final pass was missing today.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalManchester CitynewsShareReuse this content"

Even though it’s one of the toughest circuits, mentally and physically it’s maybe one of the easiest.”The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, said the team had been considering replacing Russell with the reserve driver Valtteri Bottas earlier in the weekend and praised the British driver for sticking at his task.“On Friday, it was touch and go,” Wolff said. “In the morning, he himself said: ‘I’m not sure I can make it.’ Then somehow he recovered but overnight it got worse, every single day. So I think it was a big push for him to even drive, and then to perform like this is mega.“Doing a one-and-a-half-hour race here in Baku, not putting a single foot wrong. That was a super-merited P2.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneLando NorrisOscar PiastriGeorge RussellMcLarenMercedes GPMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Manchester United and Arsenal’s supporters then spontaneously applauded on 47 minutes, with the travelling Arsenal fans displaying the words “We love you Beardy” on handheld signs, and after the game, both managers’ thoughts were clearly primarily with Beard’s loved ones.“Beardy is an incredible human. He has and will continue to leave a legacy in our game,” the Manchester United manager Skinner said. “It’s a very sad day but there’s some solace in knowing that his memory will always live on. He was a larger-than-life character. I think you live on in people’s memories – I know that I’ll keep his legacy alive by talking about him all the time.”Goodbye Matt Beard: the Del Boy of women’s football who took Liverpool to two WSL titlesRead moreWhile neither of these two teams were on the long list of WSL sides that Beard managed across his successful career, his influence on the game was so far-reaching that players and staff at both clubs knew him well, not least the new United assistant coach, Scott Rogers, who previously worked on Beard’s backroom team at Liverpool. United’s new goalkeeper coach, Joe Potts, was Liverpool’s goalkeeping coach under Beard, too. They were both visibly emotional during the minute’s silence.Similarly, Arsenal’s summer signings from Liverpool, Olivia Smith – who started the game – and the substitute Taylor Hinds, had everybody’s respect for their professionalism in such challenging circumstances. Liverpool’s match at Aston Villa, scheduled for midday on Sunday, was postponed.The Arsenal head coach Slegers praised both players’ professionalism in the circumstances, saying: “We gave them the option to choose what they wanted to do today. It’s very hard, and we’re all very sad. They both said Matt would have wanted them to play. And they went out and did it, and there was a lot of emotion I think [in] the one-minute silence moment. It was really hard for them but it shows a lot of strength from them.”It was the talented Smith, who transferred to Arsenal for £1m and had played under Beard at Liverpool before he left the Merseyside club in February, who went closest to opening the scoring in the first half, when her powerfullystruck effort from the edge of the penalty area was touched on to the crossbar by Phallon Tullis-Joyce.View image in fullscreenManchester United’s Ella Toone shoots wide from distance.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAThat aside, Arsenal’s Daphne van Domselaar was the busier of the two goalkeepers in the first half, saving well from Melvine Malard with fewer than 60 seconds on the clock and later doing well to block a low Jess Park strike after initially fumbling a cross.The hosts were giving the European champions a tough test, with Park once again showing lots of silky skill as she continues to endear herself to the United fans after her deadline-day switch from Manchester City.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The substitute Chloe Kelly was presented with a golden chance inside the penalty area but could not quite connect with her strike.At the back for Arsenal, their 18-year-old centre-back Katie Reid produced another solid performance, as she continues to deputise for the injured Leah Williamson, and Slegers will have been delighted by the teenager’s calm handling of the threats posed first by Malard and then substitute Elisabeth Terland, who had scored a hat-trick on this ground three days earlier.Manchester United’s Ella Toone drove a bouncing effort wide in stoppage time but in the end both teams had to settle for a clean sheet. The game felt very much overshadowed by the weekend’s news, however, and Slegers added of Beard: “I felt his warmth as a person.“It’s such sad news, everyone was really shocked, and I feel very, very sorry for his closest family and his loved ones.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester United WomenArsenal WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A broken thumb denied him a Test debut against New Zealand last winter; an abdominal injury forced him out of the squad to face Zimbabwe at the start of this summer. And after England bowled first in the final T20 international against Ireland, he jarred a knee while taking a catch in the deep, forcing him off the field and bringing into question what role he would play in the chase.But a grimacing knock was also a breakthrough: Cox struck a 35-ball 55, his first international half-century, in a chase of 155, securing England a comfy six-wicket victory and a 2-0 series win. Having entered at 33 for two, the 24-year-old – who was not originally included in the touring party – was tested in an experimental middle order and reeled off the strokes that made him the leading run-scorer in this year’s Hundred. Tom Banton showed calm, too, putting on 49 with Cox and remaining unbeaten on 37.“I seem to do well in an Oval [Invincibles] shirt,” said Cox. “So I was like: ‘Come on, this is just franchise cricket and I’m playing for the Oval, so just enjoy it and have a bit of fun.’ To get in this team is pretty tough. There wasn’t a chance I wasn’t going to bat because I might have to wait another two years.”Ireland v England: third men’s T20 cricket international – liveRead moreRain got in the way of the second T20, and while winter jackets were still required, Malahide found some sun in the early afternoon. England made two changes: in came Cox and Sonny Baker, who made his second white-ball bow this month. The first had been ruined by Aiden Markram’s bat as Baker conceded 76 from his seven overs on his one-day ­international debut.Ross Adair’s record is some way off Markram’s, but the 31-year-old’s quirky method – the backlift set up for cross-bat bludgeons – enjoyed Baker’s opening spell. The quick’s second over went for 16 as Adair lofted the ball over the off-side ring.Spin brought England joy. Liam Dawson took two deliveries to find Paul Stirling’s edge, while Rehan Ahmed had Adair sweeping to deep midwicket, gone for 33 off 23. Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker ­combined for 123 in the opening T20 but there was less stability in the middle order this time round. Jamie ­Overton prompted a couple of miscues, while Ireland failed to decode Adil Rashid’s googly.View image in fullscreenJos Buttler catches out Ireland’s Paul Stirling during the T20.Photograph: Brian Lawless/PAThe game, however, refused to go Baker’s way: Gareth Delany picked a slower ball to drive through the ­covers for four and back-to-back sixes behind square leg followed, the seamer’s threat reduced whenever he dropped short. He finished with figures of none for 52 from four overs. Brighter days will hopefully follow but the shift from domestic cricket has been brutal.Passing showers delayed the restart before Jos Buttler fell for none to a ludicrous catch by Curtis ­Campher at short cover, flying low to his right for the one-hander. Cox, who hurt himself at deep backward square when holding on for Rashid’s third wicket, settled quickly after Jacob Bethell departed at the start of the fifth over. He swung hard over the leg side and moved to 22 off just eight deliveries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I haven’t played since the Hundred final, resting my rib for four weeks, but I also had a bit of a sore knee then. I’m not going to let down the opportunity to play for your country because I’ve got a sore knee.”Phil Salt swapped his usual hyper-aggression for a more measured approach at the other end, and while he edged behind off Campher for a 23-ball 29, England’s required rate was below six as they entered the final 10 overs. Cox eventually ­succumbed to Ben White’s legspin, but he had already decided the game’s direction.Explore more on these topicsCricketIreland Cricket TeamEngland cricket teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Kenya finished second in those two categories with 11 total medals and seven gold. Jamaica, a traditional powerhouse at the championships won the third-most medals (10) but only one gold.

However in the US media, countries are usually ranked by total medals rather than gold, and the US won the most overall medals in Beijing with 18 compared to Kenya’s 16.This year’s edition in Tokyo was disappointing for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, who finished without a gold for the first time since 2003 in Paris.

Régis Le Bris’s side could easily have folded after the 33rd-minute dismissal of their left-back Reinildo Mandava for violent conduct and the rare second-half mistake from Robin Roefs that allowed Matty Cash to shoot Emery’s team ahead from 25 yards.Another Bournemouth blank for Eddie Howe as Newcastle are heldRead moreInstead, with the central defenders Nordi Mukiele and Omar Alderete outstanding, Le Bris’s 10 men simply regrouped before Wilson Isidor half-volleyed his third league goal of the season to strip the shine from the Villa manager’s weekend.With seconds remaining an increasingly agitated Emery was evidently so disgusted by the visitors’ passivity that he turned on his heel, briefly shook Le Bris by the hand and stormed down the tunnel.“We have to accept one point but this is not how we want to be as a team,” said Villa’s manager. “We need to get our identity back. We need to get confident again. I’m frustrated and disappointed. It should have been easier playing against 10 men but we’re not playing with the identity we’ve shown in the last three years. For me, it’s not enough.”Emery added: “We were lazy sometimes in defence. For example, when we conceded we were lazy.”Le Bris seemed somewhat more content. “It was a good draw,” he said after his promoted side’s eighth point in five games. “We started really well. Then came the red card but we reacted very well. We made a new gameplan, the team did really well in a deep block and it became a set piece game. I really liked our reaction to Villa’s goal, it would have been easy to give up but we showed we wanted to suffer together. The value of this point is really important.”With 11 men it could easily have been three points, especially as Chris Rigg had shimmered in midfield on his first Premier League start. Poor Rigg was sacrificed as Le Bris sent on an extra defender and switched to a back five after Reinildo’s exit, but there is surely much more to come from the talented 18-year-old.With Rigg still on the pitch it had taken some fine defending on Ezri Konsa’s part to deny Isidor as the striker repeatedly threatened Emiliano Martínez’s goal.Morgan Rogers remained worryingly isolated and seemingly unable to link Villa’s attacking play, and Roefs was left largely untested throughout a first half dominated by the moment when Cash slid in to drag Reinildo down and then, inadvertently, fell on top of the former Atlético Madrid defender. Reinildo, the first player from Mozambique to appear in England’s top tier, took so much exception to this that he flicked out his right leg and raked the inside of the right-back’s thigh with his studs.View image in fullscreenReinildo Mandava’s reaction to a push from Matty Cash earned him a red card.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAAn early exit ensued, prompting a home reshuffle featuring Rigg’s withdrawal and Dan Ballard’s introduction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alderete, a Paraguay defender, very nearly reminded him how to score but directed a header against the underside of the bar.Suitably encouraged, Sunderland forced a series of corners and throws – Mukiele takes a seriously mean long throw – as Villa could easily have been mistaken for the team at a numerical disadvantage. Tellingly, Emery’s increasingly agitated touchline gesticulations frequently appeared infinitely more dynamic and urgent than his players’ often strangely passive passing and movement.The moment in the 67th minute when Cash tried his luck from 25 yards and watched his hard, viciously swerving shot misread by Roefs promised to be a turning point, but it would ultimately prove a false dawn.Sunderland’s Netherlands Under-21 goalkeeper looked quietly furious with himself after his attempt at a punch merely left his fingertips grazed by Cash’s strike. Creditably, his teammates refused to fold and the intelligence of Granit Xhaka and Enzo Le Fée in a necessarily narrow midfield continued to drive Sunderland forward.When the former directed the subtlest of cushioned headers over Emery’s backline, Isidor’s low, scoring shot left Martínez helpless and his manager incandescent.The late moment when Watkins failed to make any sort of contact with the most inviting of balls into the box from the substitute Jadon Sancho seemed a microcosm of his team’s enduring travails.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueSunderlandAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In what is a highly controversial move, Bradley and his 12-man side will each collect $500,000 (£370,000) – $300,000 of which must be directed towards charity, with the rest labelled a stipend – while the European contingent continue to perform at the Ryder Cup for free. Added to the mix is the fact that tickets start at $750 per tournament day.Much has been made of likely antipathy from the New York audience towards Donald and his players as Europe look to retain the trophy theywon in Rome two years ago. However, the Englishman believes USA could find themselves under intense gallery pressure if Europe gain an upper hand. “That could happen,” said Donald. “We all know how high the ticket prices are, and it’s going to be an expensive trip out for a family of four. If the US players are getting paid a stipend, or whatever it is, and they aren’t performing, the New Yorkers could make them know about it.”‘My time in the sun’: Rory McIlroy on Ryder Cup hopes and Masters gloryRead moreDonald, who also led Europe in 2023, seems comfortable that the visitors have avoided the cash element despite theRyder Cupescalating as a commercial entity. “I wanted to get ahead of this when I first heard about it last year and looked like it was likely going to happen,” Donald said of the USA team being paid. “I reached out to all the 12 guys from Rome to see how they felt. Their voices are important. Everyone was like: ‘We haven’t even considered playing for money for that event.’“We just don’t see that. We understand what it represents. We have a great purpose and that’s really enough for us. We understand that the money raised goes to help the European Tour Group and the grassroots. We talk a lot about this, we are here to inspire the next generation. So this money is going to good things. It will hopefully help future Ryder Cup players become great players. I think our purpose, why we play the Ryder Cup, is pretty strong and that’s enough for that week.“It speaks to what the Ryder Cup means to these guys. A couple of hundred thousand dollars to these guys isn’t a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. Those weeks of the Ryder Cup, they are the best weeks. There’s so much more to them. We certainly don’t need any motivation or monetary rewards to get us up.”View image in fullscreenThe victorious European team in Rome in 2023.Photograph: Marco Iacobucci/ShutterstockDonald’s level of grit is often underplayed. The 47-year-old is softly spoken but lacks nothing in competitive steel. “There’s plenty of anger and a chip on my shoulder underneath,” he said. “I want to win. When I was No 1 in the world, I would look at any slight towards me and use that as motivation.“I certainly could have easily walked away a couple years ago after a great job in Rome and people were pleased. This is a great challenge. To have this opportunity, to push yourself to try to do something that’s very difficult to do, that’s pretty motivating for me. Hopefully we can do it.”By Sunday night Donald could become the first European captain since Tony Jacklin to win home and away Ryder Cups. Recent records suggest he faces an uphill task, with the Europeans without a win on US soil since 2012, but the captain is keen to accentuate positives. Donald’s 10 ½ points from 15 matches when a player stands out as an exceptional modern day return and was a key part of the Miracle of Medinah 13 years ago. Donald will be assisted in New York by Thomas Bjørn, José María Olazábal, Alex Norén and the Molinari brothers, Edoardo and Francesco.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She is due to publish a new picture book titled Kindness Along the Way in November. She is also, alongside her daughters, a patron of the Teenage Cancer Trust and a breast cancer charity.Ferguson – who elsewhere in the leaked email says Epstein has “always been a steadfast, generous and supreme friend to me and family” – wrote that she was “advised, in no uncertain terms, to have nothing to do with you and to not speak or email you and if I did I would cause more problems to you, the duke and myself”.The spokesperson for the duchess said that she stood by her public condemnation of Epstein. They added: “Like many people, she was taken in by [Epstein’s] lies. As soon as she was aware of the extent of the allegations against him, she not only cut off contact but condemned him publicly, to the extent that he then threatened to sue her for defamation for associating him with paedophilia.“She does not resile from anything she said then. This email was sent in the context of advice the duchess was given to try to assuage Epstein and his threats.”Explore more on these topicsSarah FergusonJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

His son Nick and daughter-in-law Lise have been constantly at his side and John died peacefully in hospital this morning.”Stapleton’s formerGMTVco-presenter Kate Garraway said she was “absolutely devastated to hear of the passing of my dear friend and journalistic hero”, describing him as a “rock solid broadcaster and the ultimate gentleman”.Charlotte Hawkins and Susanna Reid, fellow presenters of Good Morning Britain, also paid tribute. Reid described Stapleton as a “legend” and “consummate pro” who was “always good-humoured and gracious to work with”. Hawkins said he was a “brilliant broadcaster” and a “genuinely lovely man”.Nick Stapleton posted on Instagram that his father had not been happy living with Parkinson’s. He added: “It turns out he got what he wanted – to leave us on his terms, without suffering. Living independently and still doing the things he loved until almost the very end. I’m sad for me and my wife … but I’m happy for him.”Stapleton was a fan of Manchester City, who said in a post on X they were “saddened to learn” of his death. Nick said that when he and his father “watched them win the Champions League in Istanbul he turned to me and said he’d die happy. He meant it.”Stapleton, a presenter for Newsnight, Watchdog and GMTV’s News Hour,revealed his diagnosis with Parkinson’s diseasein October 2024.Appearing on ITV’s Good Morning Britain after announcing his diagnosis, he said: “There’s no point in being miserable … It won’t ever change. Parkinson’s is here with me now for the rest of my life. Best I can do is try and control it and take the advice of all the experts.”Stapleton was born in Oldham and began his working life as a trainee reporter in the north-west, before moving into television as a presenter on the BBC’s Nationwide and then forNewsnight, where he reported on conflicts around the world.He became a household name after moving into the world of light entertainment and consumer affairs. He presented the BBC’s Watchdog programme between 1985 and 1993 alongside his wife,Lynn Faulds Wood, who died in 2020.Watchdog was renowned for exposing shoddy workmanship and illegal working practices, with the team often confronting business owners.View image in fullscreenStapleton with Kirsty Wark and Jill Dando, fellow presenters of the BBC’s Breakfast Time programme, in 1988.Photograph: David Crump/Daily Mail/ShutterstockIn 2002, Stapleton found himself having a conversation with police officers after a segment on GMTV when a reporter was sent out to see how quickly they could acquire some cannabis in south London.After Stapleton showed the drugs on GMTV, some viewers complained and the police interviewed him, despite the fact he had made it clear thecannabis was to be destroyed immediatelyafter the show.Stapleton said: “I got a message down my earpiece from the producer that there had been a complaint and there was a Metropolitan police officer waiting to see me. I thought she was joking at first but a charming lady inspector was waiting on the studio floor and we had a little chat. She wanted to know how it came into my possession and that was it.”Stapleton was also part of the presenting team, alongside Sir Trevor McDonald and Roger Cook, for Carlton Television’scontroversial debate in 1997 about the monarchy, in which members of the public gave their views on the future of the royal family.The show, which was filmed at Birmingham’s National Exhibition Centre and included audible booing from the audience, who also heckled panellists, was described by the journalist Sir Robin Day as “the most contemptible programme I have ever watched”.Steve Clark, Carlton’s head of factual programmes at the time, defended the boisterous debate, asking: “Is the standard of debate in the House of Commons at Question Time any better than that?”It ended with a poll of 2.5 million callers, 66% of whom believed there should be a future for the monarchy.After revealing his Parkinson’s diagnosis in 2024, Stapleton went onBBCOne’s Morning Live to discuss his illness. “Speaking is how I’ve earned my living for the best part of 50 years,” he said. “It’s very frustrating sometimes, particularly [when] people are constantly saying to you: ‘Sorry, what did you say?’ And you have to repeat yourself, time and time again.“I am fairly pragmatic about the prospect of this getting worse. I try to remain positive, because what’s the point of not being?”He also partnered with Children in Need and sang a song from the musical & Juliet, after revealing that he used singing to cope with his diagnosis.Stapleton’s son, Nick, followed him into television, becoming the co-presenter of the Bafta-winning BBC daytime series Scam Interceptors.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionFactual TVBBCNewsnightGMTVnewsShareReuse this content"

Davey boycotted last week’s state dinner with Donald Trump over the lack of US efforts to push Israel to seek peace.The Lib Dems were also notably more vehement than Labour in condemning the language seen at last weekend’sfar-right marchin London.Speaking to reporters after her speech, Cooper said she opposed the recent spate of hanging flags from lamp-posts and other street furniture: “If you want to display your patriotism, you can put a flag up in your house, in your window.

It also contained allegations of sexual harassment denied by the company. It states she was fired for “poor performance and toxic behaviour”.However, the former diplomat was barred from publicising the memoir after Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, secured a ruling preventing her from doing so. She subsequently appeared before a US Senate judiciary subcommittee, in which she said Meta worked “hand in glove” with Beijing over censorship tools – something the company has denied.Pan Macmillan, which published the memoir, said it had sold more than 150,000 copies across all formats. The book was also named in The Sunday Times‘ bestselling hardbacks of 2025 so far. The paperback edition is due to be published early next year.New York magazine has previously reported that Wynn-Williams was paid an advance for the book of more than $500,000 (£370,000).Haigh highlighted Wynn-Williams’s case in the House of Commons during a debate about employment rights on Monday. She said Wynn-Williams’s decision to speak out had plunged her into financial peril.“Despite previous public statements that Meta no longer uses NDAs [non-disclosure agreements] in cases of sexual harassment – which Sarah has repeatedly alleged – she is being pushed to financial ruin through the arbitration system in the UK, as Meta seeks to silence and punish her for speaking out,” she said.“Meta has served a gagging order on Sarah and is attempting to fine her $50,000 for every breach of that order. She is on the verge of bankruptcy. I am sure that the whole house and the government will stand with Sarah as we pass this legislation to ensure that whistleblowers and those with the moral courage to speak out are always protected.”It is understood that the $50,000 figure represents the damages Wynn-Williams has to pay for material breaches of the separation agreement she signed when she left Meta in 2017. Meta has emphasised that Wynn-Williams entered into the non-disparagement agreement voluntarily as part of her departure.Meta said that to date, Wynn-Williams had not been forced to make any payments under the agreement.The company did not wish to comment on Haigh’s intervention. It has previously said that Wynn-Williams’s Senate testimony was “divorced from reality and riddled with false claims” about China and the company’s treatment of teenagers.Meta has described the book as a “mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives”. It has said she was fired for “poor performance and toxic behaviour” and that an investigation concluded she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment.It said the ruling preventing her from publicising the memoir confirmed the “false and defamatory book should never have been published”.The ruling stated Wynn-Williams should stop promoting the book and, to the extent she could, stop further publication. It did not order any action by Pan Macmillan.Wynn-Williams has not spoken in public since appearing at the Senate hearing in April. In a written statement this month, she said she was grateful that the US Senate was continuing to investigate Meta’s behaviour.“I wish I could say more,” she said. “I urge other tech employees and those who are thinking of whistleblowing to share what they know before more children are harmed.”Her lawyer confirmed Wynn-Williams “remains silenced about the very matters Congress is investigating, despite clear and unanimous voices from Congress calling on Meta to end their arbitration proceedings which threaten to bankrupt her”.Explore more on these topicsMetaFacebookSocial networkingnewsShareReuse this content"

It was repulsive, absolutely untouchable.”The Chicago River has a long history of being meddled with. Each year it isdyed greenfor St Patrick’s Day and, infamously, in 2004 the tour bus of Dave Matthews Bandreleased800lbs(363kg) of human waste through a bridge grate that landed on top of a boat of mightily unfortunate sightseers traveling on the river.Revealed: river pollution twice as bad inside national parks as outside themRead moreIndeed, Chicagoinitially grewby treating its slow-moving river as an unfettered dumping area. Sewage and other waste was routinely funneled into the river, including carcasses and effluent from huge slaughterhouses that clustered beside the waterway – to the extent that a section of the river is still called “bubble creek” due to the gas given off by the rotting sludge on the riverbed.The river became so foul, causing deadly outbreaks of cholera and typhoid, that the city took the extraordinary step in 1900 ofreversingthe river’s flow by creating a system of canals and locks, to avoid Chicago’s source of drinking water in Lake Michigan becoming poisoned. Today, the 156-mile (265km) river meanders from Lake Michigan through Chicago so its water ultimately empties into the Gulf of Mexico.“We treated the river like it was part of the sewer system, which haunted us,” said Margaret Frisbie, the executive director ofFriends of the Chicago River. Riverside buildings typically didn’t even have windows overlooking what was known as “the stinking river”, with the ribbon of water shunned as part of Chicago’s civic fabric.“Until just a few years ago people would’ve thought it would be outrageous to jump into it,” Frisbie said. When Friends of the Chicago River formed in 1979 with a vision to restore the ecological function of a river that could be enjoyed by people and wildlife alike, “people thought we were crazy,” she said.Yet the 1970s was a seminal decade for environmental protection in the US, with the passage of the Clean Water Act and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) – bringing new restrictions on pollution dumped into rivers, streams and lakes. Where once American rivers were so toxic theycould catch fire, a new era had begun that would allow US cities to think more affectionately of their foundational waterways.View image in fullscreenOfficials stand above the Chicago River on Sunday in Chicago, Illinois.Photograph: Chris CostosoIn Chicago, the slaughterhouses shut down, new sewage and storm water infrastructure was built and teams of volunteers, as they do to this day, toiled to clean up trash.Dozens of species of fishreturned, as did beavers and snapping turtles such asChonkosaurus, an enormous, locally famous specimen sometimes seen lounging by the river.In 2016, a riverside public pathway was completed to knit the downtown area to its adjacent water, allowing Chicagoans in new bars and restaurants to gaze upon a river that is no longer a fetid soup, a place clean enough that people can now swim in it. On 12 September, it was announced that Friends of the Chicago Riverwonan international prize in recognition of the river’s transformation.“So many people are on rental boats on the river these days – it’s heaving with people,” Frisbie said. “People want to work near the river, live near it, be on it. It’s remarkable to see people have that connection with it again.“This swim is emblematic of all the work we’ve done over the past 50 years to improve our rivers. It shows you can change the destiny of any natural resource and do some good. It feels that’s something we need right now.”America’s rivers may now increasingly be places of scenic recreation rather than industrial sacrifice zones, but this does depend on the vicissitudes of politics. TheTrump administrationisnarrowingthe application of the Clean Water Act, which helped ensure healthier rivers, and is similarly weakening rules on what coal plants and factories can dump in waterways. The bad old days may be a thing of the past, but ongoing progress isn’t guaranteed.View image in fullscreenOlivia Smoliga, Olympic gold medalist and the first-place winner of the Chicago River swim, on Sunday.Photograph: Chris Costoso“If the federal government retreats from enforcement, things could slide backwards,” Frisbie said. “It’s incumbent on cities, countries and states to be vigilant. Our river is beloved now – people want to use it, wildlife needs it, we need it. We want to maintain that rather than see it roll back.”On Sunday, though, few swimmers were mulling such weighty topics as they lined up in robes, serenaded by the skirl of the Chicago police department’s bagpipes and drum, before stripping and vaulting into the river, bobbling flotation devices tethered to their waists.Organizers had zealously tested the water in the weeks before the event, finding that the river was consistently safe in terms of EPA standards on fecal coliform – essentially, poo in the water. The river was scanned, too, for any potential obstructions to the swimmers.Among the participants for the first river swim in 98 years – all strictly vetted to ensure they could complete the course – wasOlivia Smoliga, who grew up in the Chicago suburbs and went on to win a gold medal in backstroke at the 2016 Olympic games.Open water swimming is a different beast to the lanes of a pool, but Smoliga’s competitive spirit compelled her to speed around the river loop, even though it was not intended to be a race.“You have people throwing elbows there – you have to watch out for fingernail length, everything,” she said. “The fact they were able to clean up the river and do such great work, to have this full on race happen, is trippy. But it’s really cool.”Explore more on these topicsChicagoRiversPollutionIllinoisnewsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli prime minister suggested that if Iranians took to the streets and overthrew their government, he would flood the country with Israel’s top water experts, bringing with them cutting edge technology able to recycle and desalinate Iran’s water.Netanyahu clearly felt he had shaped his appeal to highlight one of the Iranian government’s great vulnerabilities, and on that he was right, even if he was precisely the wrong man to make such a pitch.Iran is facing multiple resource crises brought on by climate change, sanctions, successive mistakes and neglect by government. Blackouts, planned or unexpected, occur most days in dusty Tehran, even, ironically, at the US embassy, once the nerve centre of the defeated imperialists.View image in fullscreenA taxi driver tries to cool off by having water poured on his head on a hot summer day in Tehran, Iran, in July.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe president, Masoud Pezeshkian, is disarmingly open about the scale of the crisis. “There is currently a problem with water, electricity and gas. There is no water behind the dams. The wells beneath our feet are also running dry. Those who claim there is water should come and tell us where this water is …”For five years, Iran has been struggling with a drought that, experts agree, has been madefar more severeby climate change. Steadily dropping levels of rainfall – a sweltering Tehran had only 158mm of rainfall last year, 42% less than the long term average – have combined with excessive consumption, particularly in agriculture, plus mass unauthorised extraction of groundwater and a fondness for prestigious but faulty engineering projects.The water is running frighteningly low and this summer no fewer than 19 of Iran’s dams had only between 3 and 15 % of their water left. The capital’s three dams – Lar, Malu and Amir Kabir – were at critical levels by September, but appeals to the citizens of Tehran to cut their water consumption by 25% have not yet worked, so now there are plans to halt all construction work in the city for two years. Iran is now on the brink of the taps running dry.In an interview with the Guardian in her Tehran offices, Shina Ansari, Iran’s vice-president and head of the government’s Environmental Protection Agency, does not disguise the gravity of the crisis. “Iran is located in the so-called dry belt of the Earth, and we have faced challenges for a long time, but over the past three decades the temperature has risen by 1.8C and over the past five years there has been a 30% reduction in rainfall. Right now we are in the fifth consecutive year of near drought.”There have been mistakes in the past, she says, such as locating water-consuming industries in dry areas, or placing large populations in areas that do not have enough water resources. “Due to the major limitations that we face, we have no other choice but to change some of our agricultural methods.” This, she admits, is socially sensitive.View image in fullscreenAn Iranian man walking along a dried-up Zayandeh Rub riverbed in the city of Isfahan, 450km (281 miles) south of Tehran, in December 2021.Photograph: NurPhoto SRL/AlamyEverywhere the symptoms of water shortages are clear to see, including evaporating lakes, dried out dams, massive land subsidence in ancient cities such as Isfahan, or cracks on the main rail line between Tehran and Mashhad. On government lawns, sprinklers have been turned off. The pressure reduction means water doesn’t reach high-rise flats in tower blocks. Even the productivity of palm trees in Iran’s great agricultural hub Abandan in the south of Iran has halved due to excess salt in the water.Subsidence, says Mehdi Jamalinejad, governor of Isfahan, a city of architectural treasures inhabited by more than 5 million people, “is no longer an earthquake that has been extinguished, but rather an erupting volcano.” Nine main metro stations in Isfahan, 274 main fire department junctions, 328 mosques, 37 libraries, three main hospitals, one hotel and 258 schools are located in areas with high subsidence, he tells the Guardian. Forty schools have been evacuated, and many of them were demolished due to intensified subsidence. In the last week alone, three subsidence incidents in the centre of Isfahan caused sinkholes of 7 to 15 metres in public pathways.Overextraction is a critical part of the issue, says Issa Kalantari, a former agriculture minister who has been warning Iran of the coming crisis for 20 years. “In the Isfahan city basin, we annually extract 1.1bn to 1.2bn cubic metres of water from the Earth and use it for agriculture. This excessive extraction of groundwater resources has greatly contributed to the subsidence of Isfahan. We now have 23bn cubic metres of “air” in an area of ​​up to 2,700sq km in Isfahan city and the Gavkhoni wetland. This is extremely dangerous, because this figure means that there is a 10-metre underground void that constantly causes subsidence in Isfahan city. This is why Isfahan’s historical monuments, roads, refineries, power plants and even its schools and houses are being destroyed.”But the single dramatic and tragic example is the near complete evaporation of the turquoise Lake Urmia in north-western Iran, once the Middle East’s largest lake and the world’s sixth largest saltwater lake. A tourist destination 20 years ago, it now has a water depth of only half a metre. The effects of the long drought and rapid evaporation in the high temperatures have combined with excessive dam production and agricultural overproduction.View image in fullscreenSatellite images show how water filled most of Lake Urmia in 2020 (left) – and the desiccated lakebed three years later.Photograph: NASA Earth Observatory/AFP/Getty ImagesDespite the preparation of innumerable comprehensive rescue plans, including taking water from the Caspian Sea, or paying farmers to stop using so much water, it is possible the lake will no longer exist by the end of this summer if current conditions persist. In fact, according to Banafsheh Zahrai, the head of the Water Institute at the University of Tehran, the lake has already reached a “point of no return”, due in large part to the irrigation of ever expanding farmland around it. And its loss will have a multiplier effect she warns: “The consequences of the drying up of Lake Urmia do not end with just warmer regional weather or turning into salt flats; rather, similar to the experience of the drying of the Aral Sea, we will witness outbreaks of various cancers, all kinds of diseases, and vast areas around the lake becoming depopulated.”On top of that, says Alireza Shariat, secretary general of the Iranian Water Industry Federation, the salt bed that forms after a lake dries up strongly reflects sunlight. This phenomenon creates what experts call the “urban heat island effect”. On a regional scale, such an effect increases air temperatures and pushes climate conditions toward warmer and drier conditions. It means that from now on, the areas around Urmia, Bazargan, Kurdistan and even eastern Azerbaijan will have to face a warmer and drier climate than in the past. Salt storms will proliferate. “This normalisation is the most dangerous part of the story. When people no longer show sensitivity towards their land and natural resources, disaster becomes an everyday reality”.Around the lake, agricultural land, which used to be only 300,000 hectares (741,316 acres) in the late 1970s has now reached about 700,000 hectares (1,729,738 acres). To irrigate this vast area of ​​land, about 4.5 to 5bn cubic metres of water are needed annually. But the region’s water yield is less than 4bn cubic metres, a significant part of which is lost in the normal process of evaporations.Shariat predicts: “Soon we should only search for Lake Urmia in history books or in old photographs; there is no trace of it left in reality.”View image in fullscreenIranians bathing in Lake Urmia, north-western Iran, in 2016.Photograph: Ebrahim Noroozi/APMeanwhile, groundwater is being lost to thousands of illegal wells. More than 8,000 unauthorised wells were found in the mountainous region of Alborz in northern Iran alone. No one can find a way of stopping desperate farmers from building them, even though they add to the risk of subsidence. As Hamidreza Janbaz, former adviser to the deputy minister of water and soil of the ministry of agriculture, told the Guardian: “We have 8m hectares (19.8m acres) of irrigated land in the country and we have dug 1m wells 80 to 200 metres deep, which means that there is one well for every hectare of the country’s irrigated land.” All in all, the figures show that Iran is suffering from a massive overabstraction of water calculated to be 43m cubic metres per year.Even within the confines of a censored media, Iranians have a developed ability to parcel out blame, which is currently being spread around between sanctions, climate change, the water mafia and the absence of expertise.It seems universally accepted that Iran’s set of institutional controls over water usage – its water governance system – is badly fragmented, so although the Ministry of Energy is alone responsible for water, the Ministry of Agricultural Jihad, the Ministry of Interior, governors and MPs all each have some responsibility, but do not coordinate.Ansari is battling to change the direction of travel, she says. For example, “too many dams in the past were built without environmental impact assessments, but since 1994 these assessments are mandatory. We have tried to reorganise the priority for water so lakes and wetlands come first. We are facing the fact that deep water resources are completely empty, so we are trying to limit the expansion of cities and locate more industries closer to the southern coastland. It is very challenging,” she says, with some understatement.Tackling the issue of agriculture is another urgent priority: agriculture takes up 88% of water consumption but only produces about 10 to 12% of the country’s GDP. Many say the farmers’ consumption of water needs to be nearly halved, so instead of allocating 77bn cubic metres of water to the agricultural sector, it needs to be cut to 40bn cubic metres of water. Iranian farmers need to move out of water consuming crops such as rice or watermelons, or out of agriculture altogether. The goal of self sufficiency in food may also need to be suspended. But getting farmers to move out of watermelons and rice and into pistachios is not easy.Ansari admits: “Due to the major limitations from which we suffer we have no other choice but to change fundamentally some of our methods and policies in the agriculture industry. It is a fact that agriculture consumes the most water so we have to focus there, but by no means not exclusively. Many of our crops in the past were water consuming, especially around the wetlands and rivers. Changing the systems of irrigation matters, but so do the crop themselves. In parts of central Iran, we have had a lot of rice agriculture like in Japan. That has to change. Sometimes that involves finding substitute methods of income so these communities are not only dependent on agriculture.” Those words foreshadow thousands of difficult discussions with Iran’s farmers.But, she says, Iran can draw on its traditions. “In several of our ancient cities like Nain, Yazd, Kerman, our ancestors used qanats – underground water channels – or wind catchers (towers on the top of buildings). We have shown we have the ingenuity.” However, she believes that a root cause of many of Iran’s difficulties is that in the past century they have followed western methods of development. “We need to combine historic lessons with modern ways of controlling energy and water resources.”What of reducing Iran’s use of fossil fuels, the bigger picture? The simple truth is that Iran faces the dilemma common to almost all the biggest emitters, where though the impacts of climate change in the form of drought or rainfall or heatwaves are grave and worsening, the income from fossil fuels – Iran is believed to have the thirdlargest oil reservesin the world – is too critical to their economy to imperil.View image in fullscreenA boy stands in front of old and abandoned boats where there was once a lake in the Iranian province of Sistan and Balochistan.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyAre there signs that Iran wants to shift direction? With more than 20 years experience and a doctorate in environmental management, Ansari is a genuine expert, and her appointment as vice-president has been taken as a sign that the new government takes climate change seriously. Her emphasis throughout is the need to tackle all aspects of the climate problem together.But she stressed how at many global summits including COP she had underlined that environmental issues should be excluded from “unilateral illegal sanctions”, arguing “this is about the unity of humanity”. The continuance of sanctions is one reason Iran has refused to ratify the Paris Agreement limiting greenhouse gas emissions, even though it has signed the document.The independent Climate Change Performance Index puts Iran at the bottom of its 67-country list, but Ansari insists demand for renewable solar and wind energy, now at 1% of the energy mix, is “skyrocketing”, particularly in the private sector. The target for renewable energy is to build a 12,000MW capacity, something she believes is 100% achievable by the end of the development plan in 2028. President Masoud Pezeshkian has set an even more ambitious target of 30,000MW within four years, and, in a sign of how much political support renewables are gaining, Pezeshkian attended the opening of a giant solar power plant being launched by Mobarakeh Steel, due to bring 600MW of solar power online once fully functioning.Ansari says the ministry is determined to help reduce gas flaring, the wasteful process of burning off gas during the oil extraction. Gas flaring in Iran alone releases 38m tons of greenhouse gases annually, nearly matching the total yearly emissions of Sweden or Norway.But the speed of climate change, and critically its impact on drought, may prove, in the end, to be too fast.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe big emittersGreenhouse gas emissionsIranMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Today, they wait for a green energy breakthrough of another kind: blade recycling.Where they once stood,a clutch of 14 newer turbines have taken their place. They are larger, more powerful, and will generate five times more green electricity than the originals while taking up less space.Elsewhere in Europe, similar plans to “repower” the continent’s oldestwindfarmswith more efficient turbines and more powerful blades are under way, increasing clean power generation. However, this green revolution brings a fresh sustainability challenge for the industry as companies consider what to do with the thousands of obsolete older models.About 85% to 90% of a wind turbine is made from steel and other materials that can be easily recycled. However, the carbon fibre blades, designed to withstand the wear and tear of the elements, are more difficult to break down.By 2030 Europe is expected to dismantle about 14,000 wind turbines, creating 40,000-60,000 tonnes of blade wasteThe race to find a way to recycle old turbine blades needs to progress apace. By 2030Europeis expected to dismantle about 14,000 wind turbines, creating 40,000-60,000 tonnes of blade waste, according to WindEurope. Germany alone will account for approximately 23,300 tonnes, followed by Spain with 16,000 and Italy with 2,300.The US wind power industry is expected to follow suit. By 2050 the government expects wind turbine blade waste to range from about 200,000 to 370,000 tonnes a year as windfarms approved under the Biden administration reach the end of their lives.View image in fullscreenPieces of wind turbine blades are buried in the Casper regional landfill in Wyoming, US. Some of the world’s oldest turbines have been dumped in landfill.Photograph: Benjamin Rasmussen/Getty ImagesToday, most of the world’s established windfarm developers have vowed to avoid their old blades ending up in the ground. However, the fact that some of the world’s oldest turbineshave been dumped in landfillhas raised concerns over the industry’s sustainability credentials.Opponents of wind power have seized on the dilemma of what to do with old turbines. Donald Trump, who hasmade his loathing for the technology clear, claimed that wind turbines “start to rust and rot in eight years”.The US president said during his visit to Scotland in July: “You can’t really turn them off, you can’t burn them. They won’t let you bury the propellers, the props, because there’s a certain type of fibre that doesn’t go well with the land.”Those claimshave been dismissed by expertsand those working towards new ways to reuse old turbines. Steven Lindsay, a blade recycling entrepreneur in Scotland, told the Guardian “the reality isn’t as President Trump described”.He said: “Decommissioning old windfarms is about managing an infrastructure transition that transforms yesterday’s clean energy assets into tomorrow’s raw materials.“We’ve been using circular economy principles to repurpose and recycle the blades into valuable products for years – from using whole blade segments as high-impact public realm infrastructure like shelters, to extracting the fibres for remanufacture into something new.”View image in fullscreenThe Hagshaw Hill site above the Spireslack opencast coalmine in Lanarkshire was Scotland’s first commercial windfarm.Photograph: Construction Photography/Avalon/Getty ImagesThe former employee ofScottishPower, which owns the Hagshaw Hill windfarm, struck a deal with the rival developer SSE to use retired blades from its older windfarms as shelters for electric vehicle charging points in Dundee. Bus shelters and bike shelters made from turbine blades are on offer, too.However, the vast majority of turbines will not have the option of being repurposed. ScottishPower’s parent, the Spanish energy company Iberdrola, believes it may have a solution that could work at scale.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In this way it could continue contributing to the energy transition and promoting the circular economy in Spain, the company said.Mario Ruiz-Tagle, the chief executive of Iberdrola Spain, said: “We are inaugurating much more than an industrial plant. We are inaugurating a new stage in the circular economy of renewable energies. This factory, the first on the peninsula dedicated to recycling wind turbine blades, is a concrete response to a challenge that is already here.”Across the industry, companies including ScottishPower, SSE and Denmark’s Ørsted have promised to work closely with government bodies and industry associations to develop a new generation of wind turbine blade that is easier to recycle and the recycling facilities to get the job done.An Ørsted spokesperson said: “If it takes longer than anticipated to find recycling solutions that are both environmentally sustainable and commercially viable, we will store any decommissioned blades temporarily to save them from landfill.”View image in fullscreenScottishPower owns the Hagshaw Hill windfarm.Photograph: ScottishPowerIn the meantime, the industry is working with experts to extend the lives of Britain’s existing turbines to delay the need for long-term storage. The Offshore RenewableEnergy(ORE) Catapult, a government-backed innovation body, has started work with the renewables developer RWE to replicate real-world conditions in its testing lab with the aim of figuring out how to extend the life of the UK’s existing blades, and delay the need for recycling.Lorna Bennet, a senior sustainability engineer at the ORE Catapult, said: “With about 500 offshore wind turbines in UK waters due to reach the end of their original intended lifespan in the next five years there is an urgent obligation to not only think about how to increase the number of installed wind turbines generating clean energy, but to consider how we can extend the lifespan of current turbines and their components.”The early results of this testing suggests that wind turbine blades could have their lifetimes safely extended by half, in what could prove a step-change for the industry.This would come too late for the blades from Hagshaw Hill, which are destined to wait in Ayrshire for a recycling solution for Britain’s blade challenge – perhaps providing another milestone for the UK’s green economy.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryWind powerRecyclingRenewable energyEnergyScotlandEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Over the last few years we’ve seen this increasingly Trumpian approach creep in – and not only from Reform politicians – where legitimate questions are met with hostility or silence.”While Reform’s treatment of the Nottingham titles has been the highest-profile case of its type, there have been other recent examples of local authorities across the country accused of freezing out journalists.Over the summer, a BBC-funded local democracy reporter (LDR) in London said he had been effectively barred by Conservative-run Hillingdon council, due to what it regarded as “political bias” in his reporting.It followed a complaint of bias after a story about an allegedlymisleading Tory campaign leafletthat claimed a local recreation ground was under threat.Hillingdon council said it had not barred the reporter but “raised concerns about the balance of coverage”, stating it felt it had not been approached fairly for comment. “Following positive dialogue with the publication, the council will continue to engage with the reporter and has been doing so for the past five weeks,” it said.Earlier this month, Emily Price, news editor at the website Nation.Cymru, said “Engaging with Reform UK’s politicians and comms operation has become more and more arduous – particularly over the last few months.” She said it included threats of legal action.In 2022, a coalition of local media joined forces to oppose the exclusion of LDRs from briefings by Labour’s former Bristol mayor Marvin Rees. The row led to a boycott of the meetings by other local media, including the BBC, BristolLive and BristolWorld.Repeated attempts have been made to resolve the ban of the Nottingham Post. However, last week Reform’s councillors blocked an attempt to debate the paper’s treatment at a council meeting.Higgerson said: “Nottinghamshire Live is by far the best-read news source in Nottinghamshire and also read by millions more across the UK. I know our teams there will continue to rigorously report on their patch, but it is worrying that Reform have not yet found a way to move forward from this ban, to allow the people of Nottinghamshire clear sight of how the council is performing.”The Nottingham Post’s editor, Natalie Fahy, has said the saga has served as a warning overhow a future Reform government might treat the media.In an article published on Friday, Fahy said she had been left speechless by Reform councillors, who blocked a debate about the council’s treatment of the paper from being discussed.“I see now how politicians think they can play the system to avoid a discussion on something that could be embarrassing for them,” she said.Explore more on these topicsRegional & local newspapersNewspapersReform UKNottinghamNottinghamshireNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

In north-east Lincolnshire, all metal detecting requires a prior permit.“PSPOs were meant to target activities harming local quality of life but they’re increasingly used as a blanket prohibition to criminalise activities and behaviour that no reasonable person would consider antisocial,” said Josie Appleton, director of the Manifesto Club.“Some local authorities have banned shouting in the middle of absolutely nowhere,” she added. “While shouting might be annoying, how else are you meant to respond if someone’s in danger?”In the last year alone, councils have introduced PSPOs that ban shouting in the middle of the countryside, urination in designated sea areas across Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, and the possession of any object that could pose a fire risk in the Peak District. Open water swimming has been criminalised in Salford and parts of Somerset. Pitching tents or sleeping on beaches has been outlawed by multiple councils.Jon Moses, of the Right to Roam campaign, said: “We need a rules-based access system, like Scotland’s, with a comprehensive code that reflects how people use the countryside, sets clear limits on irresponsible behaviour and helps build consensus on real issues.”Some of the most contentious PSPOs ban camping stoves, which many say are vital for outdoor safety, and remove exemptions for supervised use by educational and youth groups.“Carrying a stove on the hills is a safety requirement,” said one local walker who works with youth groups. “These bans make it unlawful for young people to prepare food or stay warm in poor weather – putting them at risk.”Appleton said the bans risk criminalising young people and school groups for taking part in responsible outdoor learning. “If young people aren’t taught to use stoves safely, they’ll either misuse them or avoid the outdoors altogether,” she said.The orders apply to open access land, moorland, footpaths and informal picnic areas. They are often not signposted, leaving people unsure of the rules. Despite their sweeping effect, campaigners say councils often provide little evidence that the banned activities are persistent or cannot be managed with more proportionate tools. In the case of the Peak District, the orders were passed withminimal public consultationand no published rural or equality impact assessments.While walking her dog in rural Kent, Tessa saw a notice threatening her with a £1,000 fine if she engaged in 12 activities, including shouting, swearing, drinking alcohol or using a catapult.View image in fullscreenWhile walking her dog in rural Kent, Tessa saw a notice threatening her with a £1,000 fine if she engaged in 12 activities, including shouting, swearing, drinking alcohol or using a catapult.“I was in the middle of nowhere and suddenly there was this sign screaming at me about all the things I couldn’t do,” she said. “It’s ‘ban everything’, bureaucratic overreach; an outrageous policing of everyday behaviour.”Swimming in natural water has come under widespread attack. North Lincolnshire’s blanket ban criminalises any swimming outside a club context. In Abbots Pool, Somerset, wading and even quiet, individual swimming has become a criminal act punishable by fines of £75.Imogen Radford, the Right to Swim lead at the Outdoor Swimming Society, said councils increasingly misuse the legislation. “The PSPO legislation states that there has to be an actual problem affecting local people before it can be enacted,” she said. “The idea that wild swimming is antisocial blows my mind.”Wild camping bans have also proliferated – often, say campaigners, with no attempt to distinguish between destructive, long-term encampments and responsible, overnight stays. InDorset, Worthing, Sefton and parts of the Lake District, PSPOs now criminalise anyone pitching a tent or sleeping on a beach.Critics say the new wave of PSPOs represents a fundamental shift in how public space is governed. Appleton said: “This isn’t about protecting sensitive sites – it’s about controlling harmless behaviour.”What’s being lost, they argue, is not just access but the sense the countryside belongs to everyone. “We’re seeing a retreat from trust,” she added. “These orders treat people not as stewards, but as problems to be prosecuted.”A spokesperson for Canterbury city council said: “All our PSPOs are fully consulted on and we are absolutely certain we have the support of the vast majority of the public.”A spokesperson for Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council said: “The orders can be modified in specific areas, for versatile enforcement.”An Elmbridge council spokesperson said greater numbers of fishers had “resulted in reports of littering and human waste being deposited on the land”.A Dorset council spokesperson said: “Dorset council introduced the PSPOs following public consultation.”A spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire council said: “The numbers of applications received show that people continue to enjoy metal detecting responsibly within the designated areas.”Cumberland council said: “Cumberland council has zero tolerance for environmental harm, and anyone breaching the PSPO risks a fine or prosecution.”Explore more on these topicsRural affairsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

By early 2025, that figure had dropped to 75.3%. If that rate of change continues, manual driving instructors could soon become, in the words of industry insiders, a “niche business”.Some in the industry expect the change to happen even faster. Mark Born, the head of the AA and BSM driving instructor academy, said instructors were adapting more quickly than learners.“Among new instructors entering the profession, 36% now choose to teach exclusively in automatic cars,” he said. “In the next five years, that trajectory will start to accelerate dramatically and in 10 years – if not far sooner – I’d guess that manual driving instructors will start to be in the clear minority, if not actually a niche business.”Manual lessons would, at that point, become more expensive than automatic ones, he said. “There will be more people wanting to learn to drive manuals – because those are the cars that their parents are handing down to them – than instructors able to teach them.”View image in fullscreenLearners in automatic cars can focus on hazard awareness and road positioning earlier than those in manuals – but tend to have lower test pass rates.Photograph: Ian Allenden/AlamyThis shift occurs alongside a significant decline in the number of driving instructors. Between April 2011 and April 2024, the number of approved driving instructors in the UK fell by more than 6,000.Adam Bragg, the co-founder of Drive, a driving instructor training company, said instructors were “crossing over to automatics as quickly as they can”, but learner demand was proving slower to adapt.“The demand from learners [to have lessons in automatic cars] is slower than we expected, which is largely down to new drivers being given hand-me-down cars, which are currently predominantly manuals,” he said.Bragg considers his family a case in point. He is keeping their manual car six years longer than he otherwise would so it is available for his daughter when she turns 17. “My family is far from alone in making these sorts of decisions around when they’re going to go electric,” he said. “It’s only when hand-me-down cars become electric that manual driving instructors become a thing of the past.”The AA Driving School has forecast that by 2025–26, more than one in four driving test passes will be in automatic vehicles – a rise driven in part by growing electric vehicle adoption and regulatory pressure.Born said he anticipated changes to the licensing system to keep pace, including the introduction of a fast-track conversion route for learners who passed their test in an automatic car but later wished to drive a manual. Currently, those who pass their test in an automatic vehicle are not permitted to drive manual cars without retaking the full practical test.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The simplified mechanics of automatic vehicles eliminate the need for gear and clutch control, allowing learners to focus on hazard awareness and road positioning earlier.However, automatic learners tend to have lower pass rates. In 2022–23, the pass rate for automatic driving tests was approximately 43%, compared with 48% for manual tests.The change could put further strain on an alreadyoverstretched driving test system, said Jason Tilley, of the Tilley school of motoring in Nottingham. As of March 2025, nearly three-quarters of test centres across Great Britain were reporting waiting times close to the legal maximum of 24 weeks.“People pass their tests quicker if they’re learning to drive automatic cars, which will help us get through the backlog of people waiting for lessons more quickly – but worsen the problems at the test-centre end of the pipeline,” he said. “There are no easy answers.”Explore more on these topicsMotoringYoung peopleElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

You’ve seen a situation where more and more people are shopping online or going to out-of-town centres, shopping centres, high-profile shops have left Oxford Street, and the pandemic was a real body blow to this street.“Today is a glimpse to what the future could be like, where this is a place where people can walk. It increases footfall. It increases spend, [it will be a] great place to shop, to do leisure, but also have outdoor events.“[Today] will go down in history, in my view, as the day the fightback began to rescue this street.”Khanwants to ban vehiclesfrom a 0.7-mile stretch between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch, with the potential for further changes towards Tottenham Court Road.Detailed proposals for traffic under the pedestrianisation plan will be consulted on later this year.The mayor said he “fully understands” the “minority of residents” who raised concerns over congestion and accessibility, and said the authority had consulted residents.“We’re going to carry on not just working with residents and the council, but working with retailers, landowners and others to make sure we can return this street to its previous glory,” Khan said.Asked if he had plans to pedestrianise more thoroughfares in the capital, the mayor said: “We’ve already worked with councils to pedestrianise parts of London, outside Somerset House.

Long live Brazil!” the Golden Globe-nominated actor Wagner Moura told a sea of protesters in Salvador, the capital of his home state, Bahia.Moura, the star of the Netflix drama Narcos, hailed the “extraordinary moment” his country’s democracy was experiencing after Bolsonaro’s historic conviction – a contrast with the democratic backsliding in the US under Bolsonaro’s re-elected ally Donald Trump.In São Paulo, tens of thousands gathered outside the city’s art museum and hoisted a giant Brazilian flag over their heads – a patriotic response to Trump’s unsuccessful attempts to interfere in Bolsonaro’s trial with a pressure campaign of tariffs and sanctions.At a rally in Belo Horizonte, local singer Fernanda Takai denounced the “shameless” manoeuvres to help Bolsonaro dodge jail and politicians avoid being held to account for their misdeeds. “We need to take a stand, to show how angry we are,” Takaitoldthe newspaper Estado de Minas.In the capital, Brasília, where Bolsonaro is currently under house arrest, thousands assembled near the congress and supreme court buildings that were trashed by rightwing radicals on 8 January 2023 at the climax of the former president’s coup attempt.There were also protests overseas, including in Berlin, Lisbon and London, where demonstrators gathered outside parliament to demand Bolsonaro be jailed.Before the rallies – Brazil’s largest pro-democracy demonstrations in years – Buarque, who was forced into exile in Italy in the late 1960s during the military dictatorship, spurned the idea of an amnesty for Bolsonaro.“We do not want a repeat of the 1979 amnesty … which meant that nobody was punished [for the regime’s crimes],” the celebrated singer-songwritertoldthe news website UOL.Buarque rejected the idea that granting Bolsonaro and his seven co-conspirators an amnesty would reduce political tensions. “It was the putschists who committed the crime. We [democrats] owe them nothing,” the singer said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroProtestLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Further, they seek visitation from Ice officers to raise concerns about conditions inside the facility.‘The dungeon’ at Louisiana’s notorious prison reopens as Ice detention centerRead morePeople with chronic health conditions are not receiving prescribed medications, according to SEDND and NIPNLG’s statement, and there is no access to services such as a law library or religious programming, which are required under federal detention standards.Angola’s official name is the Louisiana state penitentiary. The strike there comes after Louisiana’s governor, Jeff Landry,declared a state emergencyin July to address what he said is a lack of capacity to house offenders at the prison.Advocates say that the reopening of what was formerly known as Camp J for immigration detentions and deportations has subjected detainees to unsafe and degrading conditions.“The real emergency is what’s happening inside: people are being denied life-saving medication, and some may die as a result,” SEDND said in a statement. “These hunger strikers are bravely speaking out, risking retaliation from Camp J guards and putting their own lives on the line to ensure those around them receive the medical care they need.”Louisiana for now holds the second largest population of immigrant detainees in the country after Texas. A small airport inAlexandriahas become the nation’s leading departure point for deportation flights during Donald Trump’s second presidency.TheLouisianastate penitentiary has a history of being used for purposes beside housing state prisoners. In 2022, dozens of juvenile detainees were moved to a renovated former death row facility on the prison grounds, which led to litigation from youth advocates.Reports from inside described abuse by guards, lack of education, and extended isolation. A judge eventually ordered the youths transferred, and called the conditions “intolerable”. Camp J itself was also briefly used in 2020 to house pre-trial detainees with Covid-19.Trump’s deportation hub: inside the ‘black hole’ where immigrants disappearRead moreCamp J, once notorious enough to be shut down in 2018, has now been rebranded. Beside Louisiana Lockup, that particular facility is now also referred to as Camp 57, a homage to Landry, the state’s 57th governor. Advocates warn that what made Camp J so brutal before, including the guard culture of abuse, violence and desperation, still remains intact.“The fact that Angola cannot provide even the most basic medical care and supplies is yet another reason this facility should be shut down,” said Bridget Pranzatelli of the National Immigration Project.The US Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the hunger strike. Homeland security has previously published a list of more than 50 Ice detainees it said were already being held at the Angola facility and who allegedly have prior criminal convictions for serious charges.Explore more on these topicsLouisianaIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US prisonsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

ThePhilippineshas an average of 20 tropical cyclones each year, making it one of the most vulnerable countries to natural disasters.“Our purpose is not to destabilise but to strengthen our democracy,” Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David, the head of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, said in a statement, calling on the public to demand accountability.Protests were largely peaceful, though police arrested 72 people, including 20 minors, in two separate incidents.At least 39 officers were injured, and a trailer that was being used as a barricade was set ablaze, according to a spokesperson. Maj Hazel Asilo told AFP that it was unclear whether those arrested were “protesters or just people who are causing trouble”.View image in fullscreenProtesters clash with riot police during the rally in Manila.Photograph: Francis R Malasig/EPAA morning demonstration at a park in Manila drew nearly 50,000 people, according to city estimates, while thousands more joined an afternoon rally at the capital’s EDSA thoroughfare.“They are draining the people’s money while citizens suffer from floods, their homes being swept away, while officials ride private planes, live in mansions,” Manuel Dela Cerna, 58, told AFP.Protesters have called for misappropriated funds to be returned, and for those implicated tobe jailed.The protests echo outrage over alleged government corruption and inequality elsewhere in Asia, including in Nepal, where a gen Z-led protest movementtoppled the government of Nepalthis month, and Indonesia, whereprotests recently eruptedover privileges given to lawmakers.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr revealed the flood-control corruption scandal in his annual state of the nation address, and later established an independent commission to investigate the allegations.In a separate inquiry in the senate, the owner of a construction company accused nearly 30 lawmakers and officials of taking cash payments, in televised testimonies that have gripped the country. Past TV interviews given by the owner’s family, showing their luxurious lifestyle, have also resurfaced, fuelling public anger.Marcos Jr has sought to placate the public, expressing support for the protests.“Do you blame them for going out on the streets?” he asked reporters at a press conference this week. “If I weren’t president, I might be out in the streets with them.“Of course, they are enraged. They are angry, I’m angry. We should all be angry, because what is happening is not right.”Sunday’s protests were held on a historically significant date: on 21 September in 1972 president Marcos’s father and namesake, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, imposed martial law. He held on to power for 14 more years, and is accused ofplundering as much as $10bn.Marcos Jr has promised that inquiries into the flooding scandal would spare “no sacred cows”.The senate president, Francis Escudero, and house speaker, Martin Romualdez, Marcos Jr’s cousin, have stepped down in the fallout from the scandal.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesAsia PacificProtestSouth and central AsiaFloodingnewsShareReuse this content"

He added: “We are bewildered as to why any of this happened and are very happy that this ordeal is over.”Barbie said: “They told us nothing. Even when we were taken to Kabul airport we thought maybe we were just flying somewhere for medical treatment.” Instead, they were put on flight to Doha, the capital ofQatar, whose officials had led negotiations for their release.Barbie said the toughest part of the past eight months had been “seeing my 80-year-old husband struggling to get into the back of a police truck with his hands and ankles chained”.The pair, who ran a charitable training programme that had been approved by theTaliban, were arrested on 1 February with their interpreter, Juya, and an American friend, Faye Hall.The arrest came when they were returning to their home in Bamyan province, central Afghanistan. Hall was released in March after negotiations that were also led by Qatari officials.The fate of Juya is unknown. As well as interpreting for the couple, he also helped care for Peter Reynolds, who requires regular heart medication, during his detention.He was prevented from interpreting for the couple during court proceedings, to the concern of their family. In March, their daughter Sarah Entwistle, who also campaigned for Juya’s release,told the Guardian: “Mum is obviously extremely concerned that without a competent interpreter, their case cannot be accurately or fairly represented and [they] will not be able to properly follow or engage in the proceedings, in serious breach of their rights.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their son, Jonathan Reynolds,told the BBCthat he was “ecstatic and massively grateful” to those who had been involved in securing their release.In a joint statement on Friday, their four children said: “This experience has reminded us of the power of diplomacy, empathy and international cooperation.”Peter and Barbie Reynolds were first held in a maximum security facility, “then in underground cells, without daylight, before being transferred” to the intelligence services in Kabul, UN experts have said.The couple married in a newly opened church in Kabul in 1970 and spent almost two decades living in Afghanistan, running educational programmes for women and children. When the Taliban returned to power in 2021, the couple remained in Afghanistan against the advice of the British embassy.Despite their ordeal, Barbie said they hoped to return. She said: “We are looking forward to returning to Afghanistan if we can. We are Afghan citizens.”Their son said: “They have not just a heart for the people of Afghanistan, but they have strategy as well, and the work they’ve been doing has been very fruitful and has a massively positive impact.”On Friday, the Taliban foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Qahar Balkhi said the couple “had violated the laws of Afghanistan” and were released from custody “following the judicial process”.Explore more on these topicsUK newsAfghanistanTalibanSouth and central AsiaQatarnewsShareReuse this content"

He’s duetted with Ozzy Osbourne, he livestreamed Nirvana covers for charity during lockdown. Now, on latest album F-1 Trillion, he’s gone country, explaining the preponderance among the audience of Stetsons and cowboy boots, doubtless getting their first airing since Beyoncé’s Country Carter shows here in June.Tonight, Malone ricochets with chaotic panache between rock, trap and twang, never making a big deal out of it. To create this patchwork of supposedly divergent elements in a moment when the culture war is using such divisions to break America apart, feels almost political. His hand-picked opening act – fellow chart-topping rap-to-country convert Jelly Roll – references those divisions explicitly, offering his music as “medicine” and promising, on breakthrough hit I Am Not Okay, “it’s gonna be alright”.Malone, however, isn’t one for preaching. He’s an entertainer, a genial, gently wasted presence who’ll drag a guy from the audience to sit cross-legged beside him on a campfire reading of Stay, who’ll lead the crowd in chants of “Ozzy! Ozzy!” and do press-ups on the gangway as barrages of pyro explode around him. With his just-woke-up hair, scruffy beard, vintage Ozzy T-shirt, cigarette and polystyrene beaker always in hand, Malone’s styled himself like an outlaw country shit-kicker from the 70s (albeit one with facial tattoos and platinum grills), though his music is slick and owes more to Jon Bon Jovi than Johnny Cash. If he leans too often towards power-balladry, it’s because he’s a genre-blind shark, hunting hooks and anthemic moments wherever he finds them.He finishes the set in a glass box above the audience, telling them they can do whatever they want if they try – that enduring American dream, one that’s getting ever harder to believe in. But when it’s sold by a man with a whiskey-stewed rocker’s rasp that keeps slipping into the sweet, singsong melodiousness of a dancehall lothario, simply dripping dangerous, oblivious charm as he swaggers, “I’ve got ‘Fuck you’ money!”, it’s not hard to see how it seduces.Explore more on these topicsPost MalonePop and rockRapreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was the cliche of stopping you in your tracks, so I had to sit on my bed and experience it. I still find it completely haunting.The first single I boughtIt was my 12th or 13th birthday and my stepdad [Foreigner guitarist Mick Jones] gave me 20 bucks, so I went and bought four 12-inches from Tower Records on 66 and Broadway, including (Nothing Serious) Just Buggin’ by Whistle and Let’s Go All the Way by Sly Fox.The song I do at karaokeI don’t do karaoke because I can’t sing. I’ve also been blessed to work with some of the most incredible singers who you’d never want to sing in front of. Gun to my head, I would do Drops of Jupiter by Train.The song I inexplicably know every lyric toNow it’s everything my two-year-old daughter listens to, although some of the Sesame Street songs from the 70s still have a magic quality, like Somebody Come and Play by the Sesame Street Kids.The best song to play at a partyYou can’t lose if you throw on Young Hearts Run Free by Candi Staton, because it just unites everybody. If you don’t find your body moving to it, you don’t have a pulse. I also like the Kym Mazelle cover from the 1996 soundtrack of Romeo + Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes that has made its way to the TikTok generation.The song I can no longer listen toI don’t know if there’s a song that I used to love that I’ve burned out on. I don’t actively listen to my own songs, but if I’m at a wedding and Uptown Funk comes on, I’m not telling the DJ to turn it off.The song I secretly like, but tell everybody I hateI used to love Pantera as a kid. So, This Love by them.The best song to have sex toI cannot listen to music during sex because my brain will start to drift. I’ll wonder what mic they used on the snare. It’s the same reason that I can’t run to music, because the rhythm dictates my pace. If anything, I need something that washes over me, like Music for Airports by Brian Eno which goes on for 48 minutes, so that’s plenty of time.The song that changed my lifeI was in a funk, rock and heavy metal band called the Whole Earth Mamas, playing clubs in New York. We idolised bands like Living Colour and 24-7 Spyz. When I heard They Reminisce Over You (TROY) by Pete Rock & CL Smooth, I was so blown away, I thought: “I only want to play this sort of music now,” so I became a DJ.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Across 43 pages, chief justice John Roberts demolished the long-held belief that a president is not above the law. For Trump, who once bragged that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it, Christmas had come early.JusticeAmy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, joined the majority but voiced doubt all the same.“Congress has concurrent authority over many Government functions,” she wrote, “and it may sometimes use that authority to regulate the President’s official conduct, including by criminal statute. Article II” – the constitutional provision concerning presidential power – “poses no barrier to prosecution in such cases.”.A year on, Trump runs amok, forever touting his enhanced powers under Article II.“A lot of people are saying: ‘Maybe we like a dictator,’” he teased recently. “I don’t like a dictator. I’m not a dictator.”Au contraire, his past self might’ve parried. Before returning to office, Trump said he would be a dictator on day one.Amid it all, Barrett plugs her book. At a recent forum hosted by Bari Weiss, founder of the Free Press, the second-most junior justice affected nonchalance.“I don’t know what a constitutional crisis would look like.”“I don’t think that we are currently in a constitutional crisis.”“I think our country remains committed to the rule of law.”“I think we have functioning courts.”When supreme court justices speak, utterances like “I think” and “I don’t know” convey more than a modicum of doubt. Barrett does not offer comfort.Listening to the Law is clearly written. Mixing memoir and civics, her book explains Barrett’s rationale for voting to overturn Roe v Wade, by which the court removed the federal right to abortion; tweaks Roberts for salvaging a pillar of Obamacare; and delivers a parting shot atJoe Biden.Back in 2022, when the court issued its abortion decision in Dobbs v Jackson, Samuel Alito (appointed by George W Bush) wrote the majority opinion. Clarence Thomas (appointed by George HW Bush) and Brett Kavanaugh (a Trump appointee) joined with Alito but also penned separate individual concurrences. Barrett and Neil Gorsuch (another Trump appointee), voted with the majority but otherwise stayed mum.Now, Barrett says Roe v Wade lacked textual support and political buy-in. Nor did time add legitimacy. For her, Roe (decided in 1973) was not akin to Brown v Board of Education, the 1954 decision that outlawed segregation in public schools, because the 14th amendment expressly secures the right to equal protection but is silent on abortion.“The Supreme Court redeemed both itself and the 14th amendment’s promise – albeit after decades of injustice – in Brown,” Barrett writes.“It’s impossible to say that a supermajority of Americans has traditionally considered abortion access so obviously fundamental to liberty that the constitution protects it even without explicitly saying so.”Time to turn to the numbers: “63% say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 36% say it should be illegal in all or most cases,”Pew Researchreports. In 2022, in the first election after Dobbs, voters in Kansas embraced individual autonomy and reproductive rights. A year later, in 2023, Ohio, Virginia and Kentucky followed, even as Ohio and Kentucky remained Republican-run.Without mentioning Roberts by name, Barrett dings him for sustaining tax credits that underlie the Affordable Care Act, AKA Obamacare, hated target of the right for 15 years and more. Criticizing the majority’s reasoning in a 2015 case that upheld part of the ACA, she writes: “I was not on the Court when it decided King v Burwell. As a law professor, however, I wrote an article expressing the view that the dissent had the better of the argument.”If you want to get into the weeds, it was a matter of statutory construction. On a similar score, Barrett recalls Biden v Nebraska. In that 2023 decision, the court determined that the 46th president’s loan-forgiveness program lacked necessary statutory and factual predicates. Six justices held that Biden could not revamp the student loan program on a foundation of 9/11-era legislation – the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 – and Covid-19.Again, irony rears its head. Trump at the time praised the outcome, saying: “Today, the Supreme Court … ruled that President Biden cannot wipe out hundreds of billions, perhaps trillions of dollars, in student loan debt, which would have been very unfair to the millions and millions of people who paid their debt through hard work and diligence, very unfair.”Now, Biden v Nebraska may now doom Trump’s tariffs. Last month, the US court of appealscited the caseas it branded the tariffs illegal.“In this respect, the Government’s argument resembles the argument expressly rejected by the Supreme Court in Nebraska, where the Court concluded that Congress’s authorization to the Secretary of Education to ‘waive or modify’ laws and regulations governing student debt did not encompass student debt relief.”The case heads to the supreme court. Whether Barrett and the five other conservatives adhere to recent precedent is a live question. As a group, they appear to bend over backwards for Trump.Not surprisingly, Barrett has little to say about January 6 and the attack on Congress Trump incited, except to remind us that the supreme court unanimously struck down a Colorado law that would have barred Trump from the 2024 ballot as a result of the riot. As the court saw things, the states could not unilaterally enforce the anti-insurrection provisions of the 14th amendment.Then there’s Trump’s continued hints about seeking a third term. Questioned by Fox News, Barrett waspredictably non-reassuring.Fox: “The 22nd amendment says you can only run for office for two terms.”Barrett: “True.”Fox: “You think that’s cut and dry?”Barrett: “Well, you know, that’s what the amendment says.”It wasn’t exactly a ringing rejection. Stay tuned.Listening to the Lawis publishedin the US by Penguin Random HouseExplore more on these topicsBooksAmy Coney BarrettLaw (US)US supreme courtDonald TrumpJoe BidenJohn RobertsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Directors are best off ignoring the Friar’s observation “they stumble that run fast” and Ellie Hurt rightly puts pedal to the metal in her vigorous production. Not for nothing is Zoe West’s Romeo wearing Nike trainers.The first act is breathtaking, the adrenaline sustained right from the opening brawl through to the Capulets’ ball. Romeo’s reflections on Rosaline with Benvolio (Kelise Gordon-Harrison) are fizzier than usual; the Nurse (Ebony Feare) is hurried out of giving her lament for Susan; and instead of trying to calm tempers, Joe Alessi’s hard-nut Capulet is ready to glass Tybalt (Milo McCarthy) with a bottle of bubbly. As the party rages, Mercutio (Elliot Broadfoot) grabs the mic to reprise lines from the Queen Mab speech like it’s a dance anthem, Mab’s drumming of a soldier’s ear turned into clubby beats.View image in fullscreenEnthralling … Kelise Gordon-Harrison and Elliot Broadfoot.Photograph: Pamela RaithWhen Juliet (Alicia Forde) and Romeo find themselves alone together, everything grinds to a halt and the stage at last falls silent. Their shared sonnet is delivered tenderly yet with a wholly realistic adolescent awkwardness. Teenage viewers who find the delicate wooing of rhyming couplets unrelatable may take heart from this Romeo’s drunken belch beforehand – and recognise the mutual blushes and hesitant touches that follow. Then the giddiness of their first kiss propels the play onwards again, with a beautifully managed balcony scene fired by nervous excitement. There’s a fresh realism given, too, to Romeo’s discovery of his new love’s identity: “Is she a Capulet? Oh for fuck’s sake!”View image in fullscreenDeluded … Milo McCarthy as Paris, right, with Joe Alessi as Capulet.Photograph: Pamela RaithThe streamlined text and dramaturgy by Tommo Fowler add to the pace, as do Dom Coyote’s compelling music and Sascha Gilmour’s unfussy, split-level set. The first prologue takes place as if in the tomb, the cast forming a chorus who carry vials, and the lovers’ death bed remains on stage throughout. The usual extraneous characters and speeches are excised (alas poor Balthasar!) but so too are the roles of Lady Capulet and Romeo’s parents altogether. Those are somewhat compensated by the Nurse and the Friar but you lose a sense of broader familial tragedy, as well as the elder generation’s implication in the cycle of violence. The slashed dramatis personae also reduces the effect of bustling households at war.The violence, sometimes accompanied by KJ’s strobe lighting, needs a little more edge although it is an inspired move to intercut Tybalt and Mercutio’s deaths with Juliet’s forceful “Gallop apace” soliloquy for added dynamism. This Tybalt is not an outlandish Prince of Cats but seems grimly committed to an inherited hatred he does not fully comprehend. McCarthy doubles as a dim, deluded Paris while Alessi makes a callous Capulet (given many of his absent wife’s lines) who is dripped in bling and overly concerned with status. The care for these young lovers comes from Feare’s playful Nurse and the practical Friar (Eithne Browne) as well as a soothing chorus who repurpose phrases from speeches into song lyrics.Hurt’s timings are on point until the end, as Juliet awakes to see Romeo’s drugs take hold – a scene that brings to bear all of the vulnerability and devotion in West and Forde’s performances throughout. They’re a dream pairing in an often enthralling, intelligent and accessible show.AtEveryman theatre, Liverpool, until 4 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreRomeo and JulietEveryman theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

With a husband who never listens, a hormonal daughter and a son refusing to grant her – even when she’s on the loo – a moment’s peace, Manito is reporting back from the frontline of unglamorous family life. And she fashions from it effective standup too, even if it starts to feels one-note, and resists our host’s efforts, never very convincing, to shape it into more than the sum of its parts.Those parts can be effective as stand-alone routines. There’s a reliably amusing number about her infant son leaving her exposed in the toilet of a Mexican restaurant. There’s a bit about easyJet’s baggage restrictions that makes up for in ardour and comic exaggeration what it lacks in originality. There are also first-base routines, like the one about sex education in the 90s, and weak punchlines, like the “space cakes” line wrapping up a section on her kids’ dressing-up days at school. I also found Manito’s scornful persona a bit two-dimensional, at least in the show’s first half, where everything is “the next load of bollocks” – like her holiday to Skegness, where “it’s windy, it’s raining, and it’s shit”.It’s a relief when we start glimpsing other sides to her, as when she sheds tears at a waxing session, or – a highlight, this – when the war in Gaza throws her chosen charity for the London marathon into embarrassing relief. By this stage, we’re getting a more rounded Manito (long-distance runner; daughter to a Lebanese dad fretting about the Middle East, and a mum developing a taste for medicinal cannabis) in place of the middle-aged grouch caricature. We get some vivid material, too. But it comes at you in scattershot fashion, with many an apropos-of-nothing segue and with Manito’s various stabs at making the show cohere (is it about the so-called “sandwich generation”? is it about her attempt to “improve her reputation”?) never quite coalescing.AtFarnham Maltings, 24 September.

Stopping at a table of new novels, she noticed a couple with Mantel’s endorsement on the cover, which, she tells me, she generally regards as instantly justifying the book’s price. This time, though, “I suddenly thought there aren’t going to be many more of these. It was such a sad moment. We’re not going to get another Mantel book, and we’re also not going to get to know about the books that she read and loved.”To many readers who gobbled up Mantel’s books – 17 of them, including the novelBeyond Black, and theWolf Hall trilogy, which won two Booker prizes – it’s extraordinary that she found time or energy for anything beside the mammoth research that her vast historical enterprises entailed, not to mention her enthusiastic and detailed involvement in their various adaptations. But Mantel was an engaged and enthusiastic supporter of other writers, especially those in the crucial early stages of their careers. Perhaps she never forgot how long it took her to see the first novel she wrote,A Place of Greater Safety, finally emerge in print in 1992.It’s fitting, then, that the award inaugurated in her name, the Hilary Mantel prize for fiction, should focus on recognising such promise. A panel of five judges, chaired by O’Farrell, will assess 15,000 words of a novel in progress, and both winner and runner-up will receive not only money, but mentoring from Mantel’s literary agency, AM Heath; the publishing house John Murray; and the creative writing charityArvon. O’Farrell is joined by Mantel’s editor of 20 years, Nicholas Pearson; actor Ben Miles, who played Thomas Cromwell in the stage versions of the Wolf Hall trilogy; and novelists Chigozie Obioma and Chetna Maroo, who both had their debut novels shortlisted for the Booker prize.Numerous writers attest to the difference Mantel’s support made, especially early in their careersWhen it comes to first-time writers, Mantel understood that this kind of support is crucial, says O’Farrell. “Someone saying: ‘This is good, keep going, we want to see how you finish it.’ I think it will make an enormous difference.”Numerous writers attest to the difference it did make. Jessie Burton, author ofThe Miniaturist, remembers a letter she received at the beginning of her publishing life: “In early 2014, [Mantel] wrote such a warm note in her amazing handwriting, which I have framed by my dressing table.” She remembers “being astonished because she was, and is, my literary hero. A few years later, she wrote to me again, to say it was ‘a treat to see you flourish’.”Miles sees the prize as the perfect way to celebrate Mantel’s contribution to literature and to the lives of other writers and artists. “It’s a great way to honour her memory, and to cause me to recall how lucky I was meeting her, working with her and ultimately writing with her,” he told me. “It was a rare, rare thing, and something I’ll treasure all my life.” Mantel and Miles collaborated to write the stage play of the final part of the trilogy,The Mirror and the Light, and on abook of photographywith Miles’s brother, George, which was the last work Mantel published before she died.“She adored talking to young writers,” Miles remembers. When they were working on the stage plays, “you’d see the cast of actors not quite know how to approach Hilary. Some were huge fans. Some had heard of her, but hadn’t read the books. But she was such a wonderful presence in any room, and over the weeks, the actors would feel that they could approach her more and talk to her about the work. Occasionally, one of the actors would mention something that they were writing, be it a TV series or a novel or a book about rhetoric for actors and directors. And Hilary would say, ‘Show me, let me see.’ She was such a collaborator.”Thebook about rhetoricwas co-written by director Philip Wilson and the actor Giles Taylor, who played Archbishop Cranmer in the stage version of The Mirror and the Light. “We became good friends,” Taylor says, “and I introduced her to the children’s mentoring charityScene & Heard, in which inner-city kids write short plays for non-human characters, which are performed and directed by professionals. The children’s words are not edited or changed in any way, and their writing is constantly funny, surprising and compelling. Hilary, of course, loved it. As soon as the performance was over she marched up to the artistic director and demanded to be a patron, which she duly became. Within a month of getting involved she had personally rung the then culture secretary and insisted he came along, which he did. Nobody turned down the redoubtable dame.”That openness to other people’s work went both ways: Miles also recalls Mantel sending him and his brother extracts from The Mirror and the Light as she was writing it. “And it was really hard not to gush,” he laughs. “But it was a genuine question; she wanted to know what we thought of what she was doing.”Mantel was straightforward about her abilities and her ambitions. Possibly she felt false modesty to be a form of inverted vanity, and she was highly attuned to the challenges of creating her fictional worlds and to the intense effort – intellectual, emotional, logistical – that each project demanded. But although she might occasionally have tended towards the aphoristic, even her pithiest advice opened up horizons. “If you don’t mean your words to breed consequences,” she wrote in a piece forthe Guardian, “don’t write at all; the only tip you can give to a prospective writer is: ‘Try to mean what you say.’” In practice, meaning what you say is harder than it looks, and Mantel’s work was an extended elaboration of how it is done. In her 2017 Reith Lectures, she said: “In time, I understood one thing; that you don’t become a novelist to become a spinner of entertaining lies, you become a novelist so you can tell the truth.”With this prize comes another chance for Mantel’s generosity and her lifelong commitment to the power of literature to make itself felt. “By writing a novel one performs a revolutionary act,” she once wrote. “A novel is an act of hope. It allows us to imagine that things may be other than they are.”The Hilary Mantel prize for fiction will be open to unpublished writers living in the UK and Irelandfrom Monday to 31 December 2025, and will be awarded in spring 2026.

I got introduced to a new way of life. She is a businesswoman; she wore Armani suits. It opened up a new world.We’re now retired, but we had both been self-employed, so when I got paid for a project we’d go out and celebrate irresponsibly. We’d go to Harvey Nicks, drink far too many cocktails, and then end up buying a pair of Jimmy Choos and nice lingerie. It was fun, very erotic. Linda is so sexy and I get so much enjoyment from what she wears and how she shows off.The boudoir photography started after we’d been together six months. We were at a hotel, and she had a little Sony camera, and I just took a picture of her bending over. She’s got a great bum and she knows it. Taking photos became quite an intense hobby for me. Linda seems to revel in showing herself off, and I enjoy my wife looking utterly beautiful. I’m trying to capture how amazing she looks and how amazing she is. And I get very turned on too.As the night progresses, my excitement grows, and after a couple of hours, she’ll say something like: ‘Could you untie this?’We’d set up photo shoots on our holidays or free weekends. She would take her time dressing up. I’d set up my camera and we would spend a couple of hours trying different poses and experimenting with the light. As the night progressed, my excitement would grow, and after a couple of hours, she’d say something like: “Could you untie this?” And that would always lead to sex. Quickies have never been our thing. We enjoy quite intense, long nights, even if it’s just being naked and talking.Boudoir photography has been a lot of fun. We’d go through the pictures together afterwards, and get down to the best 20 or 30 that we’ll save for ever. I have looked at them many times afterwards on my own and got pleasure from them.We’re getting older now so we need a day for recovery time, but our sex life is very healthy. We used to do the photography sessions every couple of weeks, but now it’s probably every couple of months. There’s nothing too serious or pornographic about it, but it gives us both a lot of pleasure.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

It was inspired by a metro accident outside Rotterdam in which the train overran the elevated station stop, but was saved from plunging into the water below by a 10-metre-high sculpture of a whale’s tail, one of two placed there by artist Maarten Struijs. There were no passengers on board, and the driver managed to escape unharmed.Was this a one-off? Have there been other works of art that have played a rescue role? Or is their potential for salvation solely restricted to the spiritual?Astrid, CoventrySend new questions tonq@theguardian.com.Readers replyA one-off, due to a vanishingly unlikely coincidence. The whale tail sculpture’s ability to support the weight of the train without breaking was an unexpected fluke – and it would never have happened at all had it not been for its amazingly serendipitous location at what should surely now be known as Rotterdam whale-weigh station.ThereisnoOwlThe art therapist Margaret Naumburg successfully worked with schizophrenic patients during the second world war at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, using arts therapy as a first-line treatment. Allen Ginsberg was treated similarly at the same hospital in 1949 and went on to have a career as a major and influential poet. Thomas Hennell recovered from a schizophrenic episode while painting a mural at Claybury mental hospital in the 1930s, and went on to become a war artist.dave56I’m not sure the spiritual is divorced from the physical. It’s a continuum. Art has been a thread throughout my life, from being old enough to hold a drawing implement. It has allowed me to express myself, explore the world and what’s going on in my head, move through time. It’s a flow that I follow, like a little boat on a river, sometimes flowing fast and sometimes barely flowing at all, but always at the heart of who I am. It’s saved me many times.LorLalaDoing art can save lives. Seeing art can be inspirational, but practising creativity is how many lives have been saved. I am pretty sure I wouldn’t still be here if not for creativity.kiramangoThere was that one time when a man was almost killed by a train coming out of his own fireplace, but luckily it turned out to be just a painting by Magritte.misruleOlafur Eliassonuses art to raise awareness of humankind’s role in causing climate collapse, specifically by using melting ice installations in cities across the globe. Hopefully, their expected impact might change a few minds, perhaps some influential ones, who might change the course of history … and halt the extinction of most species.woodworm20If we are including music, then yes, art can save lives. At 13, I’d decided to kill myself and put on a Suicidal Tendencies album while I thought about the best way to do it. I loved their music but had never paid much attention to the lyrics before. But for the first time, as I lay there, I listened to the lyrics, which often dealt with the singer’s mental health issues. Realising that there were others out there who were struggling as well made me feel not so alone and isolated.HectormandarinThere was a study that showed male suicide levels went down significantly when a football World Cup was on. Even in countries that hadn’t qualified. Whether it was a distraction, or a reason to get out of bed, or a community feeling, who knows? I would think that art would be positive for mental health under a similar idea.PeteTheBeatLooking slightly askance at the question, there’s theTrump takeover of a centre of art in Washington DC. The subsequent artist and audience boycott of the centre may be a small contribution towards the saving of lives if it contributes to the end of the Trump era.IcommentthereforeIamIn 1984, I was a teenage dance student at Phnom Penh’s School of Fine Arts who was sent on a tour of a remote region of the Cambodian countryside. At that time, the country was in the middle of a civil war in which villages controlled by the government during the day were controlled by Khmer Rouge guerrillas at night. The government wanted to prove to its traumatised people that it was authentically Khmer. So, on its behalf, my fellow traditional performing arts students and I travelled along muddy roads in a bus, and staged dances and plays in fields or village squares for farmers and other rural people. One morning, we were having noodles in a market when the vendor informed us that Khmer Rouge fighters had come to our performance the previous evening armed with rocket launchers, with the intention of slaughtering us.

ItsSupersonic hair dryerwas followed by the Airwrap multi-styler, a revolution in hair styling that uses air rather than direct heat to curl hair – and regularly sells out in stores worldwide despite its high price.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There have been two updates to the Airwrap since – a 2022 upgrade and the app-drivenAirwrap id, which launched last year with variants for both curly and straight hair. This summer’s Co-anda 2x is a completely re-tooled product, with a more powerful motor for faster styling, and new attachments, including an air-powered straightener. I tested the new model to find out if it could really be worth £580.View Straight + Wavy at John LewisView Diffuser version at DysonHow I testedView image in fullscreen‘I compared the speed of styling and the overall finish with my older Airwrap id.’Photograph: Lisa Smith/The GuardianI tested the Airwrap Co-anda 2x right after washing my medium-length curly hair, using the drying attachment to rough-dry my hair before testing each brush attachment, the straightener and the curling wands. I styled my hair before heading out to work to see how long the finished style would last during a day of typical wear.When testing, I was looking for overall ease of use (how intuitive the Airwrap and its individual attachments are to use); the effectiveness of each attachment in drying, straightening and creating curls; how well each of my styles lasted throughout the day; and the look and feel of my hair after styling.I tested the Co-anda 2x both with the MyDyson app and without it. On different days, I tried a simple, relaxed daytime style and a more defined party look. Finally, I compared the speed of styling and the overall finish of the curls with my older Airwrap id.Dyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x: what you need to knowView image in fullscreenThe Co-anda 2x Straight + Wavy comes with six attachments.Photograph: Lisa Smith/The GuardianView Straight + Wavy at John LewisView Diffuser version at DysonThe Co-anda 2x is the latest in Dyson’s range of multi-stylers, all of which use heated air rather than direct heat to style hair, as mentioned above. This has two key advantages: styling the hair with air means less risk of scorching, dehydrating or damaging it compared with heated curling tongs and wands; and with an air-powered multi-styler, you can style hair from damp rather than having to dry your hair first – a godsend for busy mornings.As with previous Airwraps, the big selling point here is the curling attachments, which use the phenomenon known as the Coandă effect to create a vortex that attracts your hair, causing it to wrap around the barrel in an impressively foolproof way. The same effect can be found in other products, such asShark’s FlexStyleandFlexFusionmulti-stylers (as well as less glamorous things such as aircraft wings). When you get the knack of it, styling with the Co-anda is almost completely effortless and about as close to magic as hairstyling gets.Like Dyson’s Airwrap id, the Co-anda 2x comes in two colours and two different variants – one with tools and attachments forstraight and wavy hair, and one with attachments forcurly and coily hair. I tested the Straight + Wavy version in ceramic pink, which comes with six attachments: a drying attachment, two curling barrels in different sizes, two styling brushes, and a new plate-free air straightening attachment.The Co-anda 2x can be controlled from your phone via the MyDyson app. You can choose from three different heat and speed settings manually on the handle or in the app, and the temperature settings can also be fine-tuned from the app to give you a slightly cooler “high heat” setting, for instance. There’s also a separate “cool shot” button to finish and set your style.Dyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x specificationsPower:1,300WMotor speed:150,000 RPMTemperature settings:three (adjustable using the MyDyson app), plus a “cold shot”Speed settings:threeAttachments:Straight + Wavy version: drying attachment, two curling barrels, volumising brush, smoothing brush and Airsmooth 2x straightening attachment; Diffuser version: drying attachment, diffuser, wide-toothed tension comb, volumising brush, smoothing brush and one 40mm curling barrelWeight:410g (main unit with curling barrel); 716g including cable and power adaptorDyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x: what we loveView image in fullscreen‘My daytime style and party-glam look both lasted a full day without dropping.’Photograph: Lisa Smith/The GuardianIf you’ve ever tried a Dyson Airwrap, you’ll know there’s something mildly thrilling about watching your hair twist itself around the barrel and pop out seconds later in a perfect ringlet. The curl id program in the MyDyson app takes all the guesswork out of curling by sending the best wrapping, drying and cooling times for your hair type directly to the device, which changes settings automatically so you never have to press a button if you don’t want to.You can also change the direction of the airflow to the Airwrap’s curlers at the flick of a switch – a neat trick that no other multi-styler currently offers. On rival multi-stylers such as Shark’s, it’s a bit of a pain to have to switch between the attachments every time you want to change curl direction – especially if you’re alternating the direction of the ringlets for a less uniform, more natural look. This is much less faff.I found the app easy to set up and pleasingly foolproof in use – you can adjust the suggested timings to your preference, for example, to style or cool for a little longer and help set your hair in place. Of course, you can also operate the styler manually, if you prefer. The new handle design with soft-touch buttons is comfortable to hold, and the heat and airflow settings are easy to check and adjust while you’re styling; I found it handy to be able to drop the heat or speed setting for finer sections of hair around my face, for example.The styling attachments twist easily on to and off the base unit, and contain RFID chips that automatically set the recommended airspeed and heat settings for each attachment. I found these suggested smart settings worked well for my medium-thick, medium-length hair and generally used them as they came. However, as with the suggested timings in the app, you can adjust these manually via the handle should you prefer. The Straight + Wavy version I tested includes two sizes of curling barrel, 30mm for more defined ringlets and 40mm for looser waves and curls. It’s worth noting, however, that the “with diffuser” variant for curly and coily hair includes only the 40mm barrel.The biggest upgrade is the Co-anda 2x’s new, more powerful motor, which spins at 150,000 RPM – 36% faster than the Airwrap id and faster even than theSupersonic hairdryer. This translates into noticeably faster styling times; I found it knocked about a third off styling times from freshly washed to dried and styled compared with the id. Indeed, the Co-anda 2x completed the initial rough-dry in just a couple of minutes and wrapped hair more efficiently around its curling barrels.Despite the beefed-up motor, the Co-anda 2x is also impressively lightweight; the main unit and 40mm curler weighed 410g on my kitchen scales. That’s not vastly dissimilar to the Airwrap id, but the Co-anda 2x definitely feels smaller and lighter when you hold them side by side. My hair felt soft and looked shiny and healthy after styling, drawing compliments from passing colleagues. Most importantly, both my daytime style and my party-glam look lasted a full day without dropping, outlasting the same styles created with the Airwrap id.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

That’s a bit of a blow, if you’ll excuse the pun, especially if you’ve invested in additional attachments for your previous models. There’s currently no equivalent to the Airwrap id’s conical barrel, a versatile attachment that I found I missed when using the Co-anda 2x.At £580, the Co-anda 2x is Dyson’s most expensive styling product to date and one of the most expensive beauty products on the market. This might feel like an investment too far if you’ve recently bought another Airwrap, particularly given that you won’t be able to use your old attachments.Despite following the instructions to the letter, I didn’t get on very well with the new straightening attachment, which, likeDyson’s Airstraitstand-alone straightener, uses air jets rather than hot plates to straighten your hair. The full-size Airstrait does a good job on my type 3 curly hair, but the smaller attachment on the Airwrap didn’t seem to grip my hair well enough to fully straighten it. It’s possible the attachment would work better on wavy hair rather than my full curls, but if you’re in the market for an air styler that also straightens, it’s worth keeping this in mind. An alternative option isShark’s FlexFusion styler(or even more recent update, theShark Glam), which includes a standard hotplate straightener alongside its air-powered curling attachments.Dyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x warranty and repairsView image in fullscreenHelpful maintenance tips can be found in the MyDyson app.Photograph: Lisa Smith/The GuardianThe MyDyson app has a section with useful maintenance tips to help keep your Co-anda in good working order, and guidance on everything from fixing connectivity issues to cleaning the filter, to hopefully get it going again if it stops working. If you’d rather talk to a person – or have reached the limit of the help the app can provide – Dyson also has a dedicatedhelpline, which is also how to book a repair under warranty if necessary.Like all of Dyson’s hair care products, the Co-anda 2x is covered by a two-year warranty under which Dyson will repair or replace your air styler if it stops working. Any spare parts and replacement accessories you buy for your Airwrap come with a one-year warranty. Book a repair and Dyson will arrange for a courier to collect your broken item.Repaired and refurbished items are also sold directly by Dyson – you can save money and do your bit for the environment by buying a refurbished machine fromDyson Renewed. There were no Co-anda 2x devices in the Dyson Renewed storefront at the time of writing, but other Airwraps were available.Third-party sites such asSell My Dysonare your best bet for turning your old Airwrap into cash; andRecycle Your Electricalswill help you recycle any non-repairable items.Should I buy the Dyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x?The Airwrap Co-anda 2x is an undeniably impressive styling tool – but let’s be clear: the price is very high. It costs £100 more than theAirwrap idand over £200 more than the closest non-Dyson equivalent,Shark’s 5-in-1 FlexFusion, all of which firmly positions it at the top end of the market.That said, if you style your hair frequently, the Co-anda 2x earns its premium. It’s faster, more versatile, and easier to use than anything else out there, including all previous Airwraps and Shark’s FlexStyle and FlexFusion multi-stylers. The combination of easy-to-use manual buttons and the stylist-in-your-pocket MyDyson app means it’s easy for even beginners to create different day and evening styles that last. It also leaves hair looking shiny and healthy – especially compared with hair styled with direct heat from traditional hot tools. Being able to style directly from damp hair is a godsend for busy mornings.Still, it’s worth acknowledging that upgrading from a recent Airwrap, especially the recent id model, isn’t the most sustainable choice – and is hard to justify from a monetary perspective too. Unless your current device is genuinely worn out, sticking with what you have will be the better option for both Mother Earth and your pocket.Ultimately, though, if you don’t already own an Airwrap (or you skipped the last update), the Co-anda 2x is Dyson’s best yet. It’s an expensive product, without question, but if you’re willing to pay a premium, it really does blow the competition away.View Straight + Wavy at John LewisView Diffuser version at DysonFor more, read the Filter’s guides tothe best hot brushesandthe best hair straightenersLise Smith is awriter with more than 15 years of experience covering beauty, lifestyle, parenting and the performing arts, and more than 40 years of living with rebellious curls.

Food styling: Lucy-Ruth Hathaway.Felicity Cloake's masterclassDessertHow to make lemon sorbet – recipeThe ultimate feel-good dessert in nine simple stepsFelicity CloakeSun 21 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareIwon’t pretend that these are the height of Italian fashion, but style is eternal – as is the childish joy of a bright yellow frozen lemon. You could, of course, buy in lemon sorbet instead, and use the flesh from the lemon shells for cocktails or lemonade (and/or freeze the juice for future use), but this really is such an easy make-ahead dessert that I urge you to give it a go.Prep25 minCook5 minFreeze4 hr 30 min+Serves4115g white sugar1 unwaxed lemon(organic lemons are never waxed)4 large lemonsA pinch of salt1 tbsp vodka, or gin or similar (optional)1 A note on the lemonsLook for large, handsome lemons – as the season proper gets underway in southern Europe, there will be increasing amounts of choice, which means this is a recipe to bookmark for the winter (assuming you don’t want to make it for pudding this evening). Make sure you get at least one unwaxed fruit, albeit of any size, because you need it for its zest.2 A note on the syrupStart by making a syrup, which may seem a faff, but it will help dissolve the sugar without you having to heat the lemon juice and so dull its flavour. White sugar is preferable colour-wise, while golden is fine; brown, however, will change the taste of the sorbet. Put the sugar in a small pan with 75ml water.3 Make the syrupView image in fullscreenFinely grate the zest of the unwaxed lemon into the sugar pan, then set it over a medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Take off the heat and leave to cool completely. (Minus the lemon zest, this is also how you make simple syrup for cocktails.)4 Prep the lemonsCarefully trim the bases off the four remaining lemons, so they will sit flat on a work surface, then cut off the tops about a quarter of the way down – these will be the sorbets’ lids later. Use a small, preferably serrated knife (a grapefruit knife is ideal, if you have one; a pointed teaspoon might also come in useful for cleaning the shells) carefully to cut out all the flesh inside the lemons.View image in fullscreen5 Collect the juiceRoughly chop the lemon flesh, then press it through a fine sieve to capture every last drop of juice (I use my hands). Gently squeeze the hollow shells and lids, too, to free any remaining juice from them. Juice the zested lemon, too, then pour all the juice into a measuring jug: you should have about 300ml in total, but don’t worry about being too exact.6 Flavour the sorbetStir a pinch of salt and the optional alcohol into the lemon juice (though you can certainly leave it out, the booze does help improve the texture of the sorbet); if you’re using limoncello or similar, add a little more to make up for its lower alcohol content. You could also at this stage add finely chopped fresh mint or basil leaves.View image in fullscreen7 Finish the sorbet baseAdd equal amounts of syrup and cold water to the juice mixture, 25ml at a time in total, and taste after each addition, until the mix is to your liking – remember that freezing will mute the flavour slightly, so it should be really quite intense. Even so, depending on the lemons and your palate, you might not need all the syrup.8 Freeze and/or churnFreeze and churn in an ice-cream maker. If you don’t have an ice-cream maker, pour the sorbet into a sturdy, freezer-proof box that’s large enough to hold it in a fairly shallow layer, then freeze for about 90 minutes, until it’s starting to go solid around the edges. Use a fork, whisk or food processor vigorously to beat the mix to an icy slush, then return to the freezer and repeat the freeze and whisk at least twice more.9 Finishing touchesView image in fullscreenOnce the sorbet is firm, scoop it into the reserved lemon shells, filling them generously so it spills out a bit. Top each with a lid, stand on a baking tray and freeze again until you’re ready to eat. The sorbets are best consumed soon after making, but they should keep well for up to a week (and, though the texture will deteriorate, they will still be delicious for much longer).Explore more on these topicsDessertFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodFruitItalian food and drinkIce-cream and sorbetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the multi-flooredCampanelledoesn’t deign to open at weekends (for now, anyway), because, well, why bother? Who would go? Mind you, on the Friday lunchtime when I stepped into this elegant, all-day brasserie in a Grade II-listed building that was once home to the London Shipping Exchange, the whole place was empty, save for a flurry of diligent, all-female staff. Friday, it seems, is also not a busy day in the City.Campanelle’s à la carte menu is similarly sparse, and oddly uninspiring. It offers the likes of lobster linguine, breaded veal cutletsalla Milaneseand Amalfi lemon tart, and claims to be influenced by the whole of Italy. At breakfast, however, it serves buttermilk chicken waffles and cornbread with organic nama yasai berry jam, though, curiously, not much in the way of fine Italian pastries or coffee.View image in fullscreenWhile Campanelle’s breakfast menu does feature tomato and ’nduja bruschetta, it also offers the rather less Italian likes of buttermilk chicken waffles.Restaurants of this kind, which are apparently designed to take money from people with money, tend to drill down on one specific region – let’s say Puglia – before creating an intricate, often fictitious backstory about how Puglia is sealed in the chef/patron’s heart via hisnonnain the Foggia mountains. Not so here, however; they haven’t even bothered with a ChatGPT-generated yarn. Instead, there’s just a short list ofantipasti,frittiand pastas, as well aspesceandcarnethat’s reportedly cooked on a charcoal grill, although during my visit I sniffed not a whiff of smoke in the air. Furthermore, Campanelle’s menu makes no claims that itscapelli d’angelo(angel-hair pasta) or linguine are handmade, even though a main course serving of pasta carbonara and a painfully lacklustre beef shin ragu fettuccine both come in at £26. That ragu, by the way, was in such dire need of seasoning that even a humble Oxo cube would have worked wonders.My starter of langoustine arancini turned out to be the highlight of the entire meal: two plump, hot, crisp balls of breaded al dente risotto rice, generous with the shellfish and with a real kick of chilli. They came perched on puddles of what was little more than a glorified mayo, but they were satisfying nevertheless. By comparison, the angel hair pasta with baby ceps was a sadly rudimentary affair that tasted mainly of garlic and field mushrooms.Alone in my quiet restaurant hell, my solitude was soothed by the arrival of another diner, a forlorn, hedge-fund manager sort who mooched in for his reservation for two while cursing the secretary who had scheduled a Friday lunchtime client meeting. After that, a few sombre-looking groups took up some of the other tables in this corporate-facing and not-very-Italian-at-all restaurant. These were clearly work teams who at some point had agreed it would be “great to get together and grab a bite”, and now here they were of a Friday afternoon, grabbing that very bite, without wine, in a stiff City restaurant while sitting elbow to elbow with people they had nothing in common with other than matching security lanyards. Campanelle is a great illustration of the pros of working from home.View image in fullscreen‘Oddly uninspiring’: Campanelle’s native lobster linguine.The whole “let’s get back to the office” brigade should be condemned in the afterlife to spend eternity in an upscale, business-lunch restaurant of this sort. Just as they are at Campanelle, the banquettes will be comfy, the light fittings expensive, the air-conditioning cool and the wine list impressive, but each plate of crab salad with smoked celeriac will be accompanied by the terror of hearing Julie from Rushmore Infinity Brokers’ faltering anecdote about her cockapoo, while her colleagues quietly die inside.The tiramisu, you might at this stage be unsurprised to learn, is not an authentic, multi-layered slice of semi-orderly, cocoa-encrusted stodge. Rather, it is a neatly stacked, precise and pretty tiramisu that’s plated as if it’s off to Royal Ascot on top of someone’s head. Call me old-fashioned, but I like my tiramisu scooped from a bowl and hitting my plate with a wobbly splat; I also want a blast of amaretto so strong that it grows hairs on my face. What I don’t want is a tiramisu I can eat between meals, like a 1970s Milky Way bar, without ruining my appetite.View image in fullscreen‘Plated as if it’s off to Royal Ascot on top of someone’s head’: Campanelle’s tiramisu.Campanelle is a restaurant for people who don’t want to go to lunch, but absolutely have to, mainly because they are contractually obliged to entertain clients. If you are one of those people, the nicest thing to be said for this place is that it’s close both to the office and to several mainline train stations, and that the bill is far easier to get through corporate accounts than the nearbyJason AthertonandGordon Ramsayplaces. Other than that, this is definitely notla bella vita.Campanelle19-21 Billiter Street, London EC3, 0203-745 0909. Open Mon-Fri 7.30am-9.30pm.

Someone approaches you at a party and tells you they made £200 in a couple of weeks, and all they had to do was take some money and pass it on. Or you see an advert that offers a job you can do remotely.Say yes to any of these and you are in danger of becoming a “money mule” – the name banks and police use for an individual who transfers illegally obtained money on behalf of criminals, often through their bank account. In most cases the person paying into your account is an unsuspecting victim of a scam, while the withdrawal or onward payment is made to a criminal.Criminals recruit mules throughout the year, and they prey on young people who need cash and may think they are doing someone a favour. In the UK, Santander says 31% of the people confirmed to have used its accounts as money mules were between 18 and 24 years old. University students may be particularly susceptible as the new academic year starts.View image in fullscreenThe repercussions of being a money mule can make it difficult to get credit – such as a mobile phone contract, says Santander.Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PABeing asked to give anyone access to your account is a red flag, as is being asked to transfer money you know nothing about. “There’s never a genuine reason for someone to use your bank account,” says Laura Carter, the head of fraud customer experience at Santander. “It’s facilitating money laundering.”Fraud detection and bank controls mean that being a money mule is a short-term prospect, she says, but the repercussions can be lengthy.“The account will get shut and they [the money mule] will go on an industry database,” Carter says. “It can make it difficult to get credit – you might not be able to get a mobile phone contract and, longer term, you might not be able to get a mortgage.”The digital bankRevolutpoints out that facilitation is a crime. “Whether you are complicit in a scheme and aware of what you’re doing, or an unwitting victim who doesn’t know the funds are illicit, you can still face severe legal consequences,” it says.In the worst-case scenario you could be given up to 14 years in prison.What the scam looks likeOften it happens in person, says Carter, so beware of approaches from people you do not know or not that well who claim to have a good money-making opportunity for you.Social media posts offering #internetmoney and similar are a recruitment tool for scammers, as are ads offering remote jobs.The good news is, you’re owed a tax refund. The bad news? It’s a scamRead moreThe “friend” or “recruiter” will say that they need to use your account or ask you to receive and send on money.What to doSay no to anyone who asks for access to your account or for you to pass money through it for any reason.Question unexplained cash, says Revolut: “If unexpected money suddenly appears in your account, do not transfer or use it … Contact support immediately and report the transaction.

Why is the French fashion icon suddenly back in vogue?Jess Cartner-MorleySun 21 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 21 Sep 2025 05.03 EDTShareMarie Antoinette: the Fragonard cupcake who bankrupted France with her lust for fashion and diamonds, who bottle-fed pet lambs while her people starved. No matter that, in truth, her frocks and jewels were small fry in her country’s financial ruin; the optics, as we would say now, were terrible. So what if she never actually said “let them eat cake” – history is no match for a great soundbite. But while opulence hastened Marie Antoinette’s downfall, it has also brought her immortality. Only Cleopatra rivals her as the most glamorous queen in history.View image in fullscreenMarie Antoinette’s pearl jewels.Photograph: Sotheby’s/Bridgeman ImagesEven as she was driven to the scaffold, an ignominious jerky ride by open ox cart through crowds of jeering Parisians, the last queen of France knew the power of fashion. Marie Antoinette had worn only black since the death of her husband nine months earlier, defying a Jacobin ban on the wearing of a colour associated with the monarchy. But on the morning of 16 October 1793, she dressed in a pristine white chemise, petticoat, dress and bonnet. The febrile fury of a hungry and angry people had already torn her reputation to shreds – she was denounced in the press as a whore, a child abuser, a barely human “she-wolf” – but knowing that all eyes, still, were on her clothes, she protested her innocence to the last in the best way she knew.View image in fullscreenKirsten Dunst (left) in Sofia Coppola’s 2006 film Marie Antoinette.Photograph: I Want Candy/Zoetrope CorpTwo and a half centuries later, Marie Antoinette still cuts a defiantly glamorous figure in culture, as compelling as she is controversial. Marie Antoinette Style, the first British exhibition devoted to her life and legend, opens at the V&A museum in London on 20 September. Its 250 dazzling pieces include one of her silk slippers, her pearls and diamonds, a dinner service, and the last letter she wrote from the Conciergerie prison before her death at the age of 37. To ratify her status as a fashion superstar, the show is sponsored byManolo Blahnik, shoemaker to style icons from Diana, Princess of Wales to Carrie Bradshaw, who writes in his foreword to the catalogue that he has “been obsessed with Marie Antoinette as long as I can remember”.View image in fullscreenThe Sutherland Diamonds.Photograph: Kira Zumkley/Victoria and Albert MuseumRight now, the last queen of France is having a moment. Not since she roamed the mirrored halls of Versailles in her macaroon-hued pomp has Marie Antoinette been this hot. That a self-obsessed, shoeaholic airhead has recaptured the zeitgeist may not be an entirely flattering reflection of this cultural moment, but the V&A’s exhibition could not have come at a more perfect time. With the world on a white-knuckle collision course between steepening inequality and thebling, $50m Venice wedding aestheticsof the planet’s ruling class, the terrible glamour of Marie Antoinette’s story could hardly be more pertinent.View image in fullscreenThe wedding gown of Duchess Hedvig Elisabeth, modelled on Marie Antoinette’s dress.Photograph: Göran Schmidt Livrustkammaren/SHMWe are in a new gilded age. Donald Trump adores the trappings of French luxury – never has a Washington inauguration been served with such lashings of Dior as it did in January – and the codes of royalty, which the US president reveres as a benchmark of prestige. Beyond politics, Marie Antoinette’s whiplash trajectory – from obscurity to the nation’s sweetheart to cancellation – reflects the rollercoaster of our celebrity age, which loves to idolise beauty and then smash it to pieces.There was more creativity, and more strategy, to her look than her image as a Versailles Barbie suggestsThere are uncanny echoes of the particular contradictions of modern popular culture in her story. Marie Antoinette is remembered for bling – her wedding dress, at age 14, was made of diamond-encrusted silver cloth – but her most famous creation was Hameau de la Reine, a model farm in the gardens of Versailles, where she and her friends would cosplay as shepherdesses and milkmaids, dressed in charming rustic “lawn dresses” and straw hats becomingly fastened with silk ribbon. If Versailles was the superyacht of its day, then Hameau de la Reine was the tradwife,Maha-adjacentInstagram opportunity – theBallerina Farmof the 18th century, if you will. And then, of course, there is her infamous declaration of “let them eat cake”, which she almost certainly never said, since she had been dead 50 years when the allegation was first hurled at her, but has stuck fast nonetheless. The first deepfake, perhaps?View image in fullscreenA 1783 portrait of the queen by Élisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun.Photograph: Christophe Fouin/Château de VersaillesThe list of famous women who have been compared to Marie Antoinette is a reminder that the monstering of female celebrities, and the ghoulish vulturing of their memories, is corset-laced through the centuries. There have been comparisons to Diana, another beautiful, blue-eyed young blond royal who was pursued mercilessly by the press and met a brutal early death in Paris. Hillary Clinton was likened to Marie Antoinette by rightwing commentators keen to portray her as elitist, out of touch and privileged: the name was flung when she claimed to be “dead broke” after leaving the White House, and when she described Trump supporters as a “basket of deplorables”.View image in fullscreenPortrait of Marie Antoinette by François Hubert Drouais, 1773.Photograph: Victoria and Albert MuseumCarrie Johnson earned the moniker Carrie Antoinette when she chose gold wallpaper for a £112,000 revamp of Downing Street. Melania Trump’s former spokesperson, Stephanie Grisham, compared the first lady to “the doomed French queen” in her 2021 memoir, describing her as “Dismissive. Defeatist. Detached.” Earlier this year, the Duchess of Sussex’s Netflix series With Love, Meghan was damned as a misfire by commentators who noted that the scenes of her feeding chickens while sporting perfectly blow-dried hair may have aimed for Martha Stewart but landed as Marie Antoinette. The comparison is generally an insult, so it was unclear what Kanye West was getting at when he described his then wife Kim Kardashian as “a modern day Marie Antoinette” in a 2016 magazine interview, but that’s Kanye for you.View image in fullscreenKate Moss in a 2012 outfit inspired by Marie Antoinette by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen.Photograph: Tim WalkerLove her or loathe her, Marie Antoinette’s is a cracking story. Born Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna von Österreich-Lothringen in Vienna, Austria, in 1755, she was sent to Paris by her mother, the empress of Austria, to be married to the French dauphin when she was 14. Her fiance, the grandson of the reigning king, was just a year older. She was a pawn in complex European diplomacy – it was said that her mother would have preferred to send an older daughter, but her sisters were married, dead or too pockmarked to please the image-conscious French court – and her pale-skinned, blue-eyed beauty sealed the deal. She married Louis-Auguste two days after meeting him.View image in fullscreenAn armchair of carved walnut, late 1780s.Photograph: Victoria and Albert MuseumThe dauphine was an outsider at Versailles. The French, who had only just finished fighting Austria on the battlefields, were suspicious of the young foreigner. Her teenage husband was a weak, colourless character, while Marie Antoinette – who loved fashion, and launched a trend for hair worn 3ft high and decorated with feathers – had main-character energy in spades.View image in fullscreenAntoinetta shoes by Manolo Blahnik.Photograph: Manolo BlahnikShe was a spectacular dresser, no doubt about that – for her husband’s coronation, she wore an embroidered gown swagged with sapphires – but there was more creativity, and more strategy, to her look than her cartoonish historical image as a Versailles Barbie suggests. Before her reign, fashion in the French court had been the domain of the kings’ mistresses. Queens were conventional, domestic figures. Marie Antoinette, childless for the first eight years of her marriage, found her status as a royal wife – and a foreign one, at that – increasingly precarious as a result.So she leaned into fashion not merely as entertainment, but as a way to boost her profile, as mistresses before her had done. She appeared at one masked ball dressed as Gabrielle d’Estrées, the Renaissance mistress of Henri IV, in a confection of silver and white gauze girdled with diamonds and edged with gold silk fringing. Her chief collaborator in image-making was her dressmaker, Rose Bertin, dubbed the “minister of fashion” by the press. Together they set a trend for Rococo pastels, and for wedding-cake gowns iced with a fever dream of embroidery, ribbons and ruffles. Her wardrobe was her own splendid livery, a defiant statement of feminine power.View image in fullscreenSevres Bol-sein ou Jatte-téton by Jean-Jacques Lagrenée le Jeune.Photograph: Martine Beck-Coppola/Grand Palais RMNIn 1781, she was said to have spent 750,000 livres – the currency of the day – on diamonds, and almost a million on porcelain. For context, the daily wage for most of her subjects was three livres. The French public, angered by the huge debts being incurred by the elites, were quite understandably furious, and found a lightning rod for their discontent. As the financial crisis deepened in the 1780s, with the price of a loaf of bread rising to almost a full day’s pay, she earned the nickname Madame Deficit. This was never going to end well.View image in fullscreenMarie Antoinette’s crystal flask.Photograph: Michel Urtado/Grand Palais RMNIn 1792, at the height of the revolution, angry crowds stormed her apartment in central Paris. Finding her absent, they smashed her mirrors and closets, venting their anger on the queen’s wardrobe. The royal family was abolished in France that same year, the queen found guilty of treason, and her fate sealed. Like Marilyn Monroe and Diana, the high drama of her early death enshrined her in the history books, and memorialised her at the height of her beauty and glamour.View image in fullscreenJacquemus’ Le Chouchou fashion show at Chateau de Versailles.Photograph: Stéphane Cardinale/Corbis/GettyNearly 200 years later, the second coming of Marie Antoinette – now reaching its zenith – began, fittingly, with the original Material Girl. In 1990, Madonna performed her hit Vogue at the MTV Video Music awards, dressed as Marie Antoinette, wearing a dress Glenn Close had worn on screen as the Marquise de Merteuil in Dangerous Liaisons, accessorised with a paper fan, pearls at her throat and feathers in her hair.View image in fullscreenBracelet clasps from France.Photograph: Dominic Naish/Victoria and Albert MuseumThe feminist semi-rehabilitation of the French queen was then fuelled by the death of Diana, with comparisons drawn between the two women, and gathered speed in 2006 with the release of Sofia Coppola’s film, based on Antonia Fraser’s sympathetic 2001 biography. Coppola, Hollywood’s patron saint of beautiful entrapped girlhood, gave us a prom queen Marie Antoinette, in pink Converse trainers and Manolo Blahniks, her powdered complexion swapped for Kirsten Dunst’s dewy youthfulness.View image in fullscreenA 2025 Dior shoot in the dairy at Versailles.Photograph: Buck EllisonThe ghost of Diana seems to haunt some scenes – Dunst’s Marie Antoinette is a hugger, in defiance of royal protocol – but Coppola’s greatest gift to Marie Antoinette’s legacy was to make her cool, adorning her in corsets and chokers that could have stepped off Vivienne Westwood’s catwalk, and in sugary pinks and yellows that are more Clueless than Rococo.View image in fullscreenA Moschino runway show in Milan, 2020.Photograph: Pixel Formula /Sipa/ShutterstockCoppola’s film is a perennial on fashion mood boards, but several designers have recently revisited the queen herself. In 2023, the cult French label Jacquemus staged a show at Versailles inspired by Marie Antoinette (backstage, the mood board was plastered with paparazzi images of Diana). When the Northern Irish designer Jonathan Anderson took up his post at Dior to great fanfare this year, one of the first images released of his new collection showed actor Sam Nivola in a white shirt, silk necktie and pearl choker, photographed in the marble and gilt dairy built for Marie Antoinette in her Versailles Hameau.View image in fullscreenMadonna performing Vogue on the MTV Video Music awards in 1990.Photograph: Frank Micelotta Archive/GettyThe V&A show features a Tim Walker photograph, taken for a 2012 issue of American Vogue, in which Kate Moss plays Marie Antoinette, lounging in couture in a plush pastel suite at the Ritz in Paris, surrounded by coiffed lapdogs. Moss plays to perfection the pampered young queen in an Alexander McQueen gown frothing with petticoats, an extraordinary headdress of ice-blue tulle wobbling above her beautiful face like one of Marie Antoinette’s famous feathered pouf styles. Her feet, in lace booties, are not tucked demurely beneath her, but stuck out with teenage insolence; she does not grace us with eye contact, but gazes petulantly at the chihuahuas. The image encapsulates how glamour was at the heart of Marie Antoinette’s love-to-hate-her persona.It is a measure of her eternal fame – and a fitting mirror image of her legendary spending – that everything she owned is priced as treasure. In 2018, Sotheby’s sold a diamond and pearl pendant from her collection for $36m, 18 times its presale estimate. Fashion helped to kill her, but it has also made her name live for ever. Marie Antoinette’s mother, in a letter written the day her daughter was dispatched by carriage across Europe, advised her that “all eyes will be on you”. How right she was. They still are.Marie Antoinette Styleis at theV&A South Kensington, London,to22 March.Explore more on these topicsFashionV&AMuseumsManolo BlahnikfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We instantly clicked,got married a few months later,andhad to decide which country we lived in: hers or mine. For ahost of reasons – mostlyto do withwork – we chose hers. Fortunately, I managed to find a job there, andafter a few yearsgotpermanent resident status. At one level, thatwas all good.In moving to my wife’s country, I gave up my preferred career andmuch of my social network. I can deal with that. But the big challenge I face is that, while I’ve never liked it much, I now detest the country in which I reside. Iintensely dislike the behaviour, the prevailing attitudes, the social and political environment, the cityI have to live in, and so on. I just hate it, but I’m stuck here for practical reasons connected with my wife’s work andour son’s education. (We wouldn’t be able to afford the international tuition fees for him to study in my home country, so moving back is not an option.)It’s making me very depressed; I feel helpless to make any changes that would support my wellbeing.My friends tell me to grin and bear it, to ignore the annoyances, butI can’t escape them.Any suggestions on what I can do to improve my situation?I’m sorry you hate where you live so much. You didn’t say where it is or name your home country.I was interested in the run-up to this though: the instantly “clicking”, the quick marriage, and the suddenness with which you began to detest where you live (though you never liked it). What happened? I felt that was key, even if it was just something which unleashed a hatred which had been growing and suddenly seems unsustainable.I went to psychotherapist Mark Vahrmeyer, who thought your letter showed “someone who doesn’t seem to think about their needs very well. I’m not surprised you feel depressed. You put up with things [that don’t make you happy]. Was there a lot of discussion between you and your wife, not just about where you’d live but about what sort of life you’d build?”I couldn’t get over the feelings of resentment in your letter and how long that has been simmering awayIs there anything practical you can do? Often when we get mired in a problem we insist nothing can be done, but even in the most entrenched positions there is usually some wiggle room. Are your son’s tuition fees the only thing holding you back? I presume you are talking about uni/college – are you sure that’s what he’ll do? You may have to ask yourself how you’d feel if you stay where you are – so unhappy – and what that would do to your relationship with your son if he is what’s keeping you there. Or is there something else?There was very little mention of your wife. Vahrmeyer wondered “what your relationship is like and if you talk to her about this? Is there a chance to retire in the near future” – when maybe you could live in your country of origin – “or to travel there more?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

What can we do?Read moreI’m sure you know that no country is perfect, and I wonder how ideal the country you left would feel if you lived there now. Even in the most wonderful place there is frustration and unhappiness. The issue remains, however, that you are deeply unhappy and need to look not only at why that is, but also at what it brings up in you beyond the obvious. I couldn’t get over the feelings of resentment in your letter and how long they have been simmering away.“It’s one thing to talk about detesting somewhere, but how,” Vahrmeyer asked, “do you talk about your needs? Is anything you want gettable from where you are now? Can your needs be met in other ways?”You’ve clearly travelled a lot, but I sensed a passivity; that can happen with depression, but maybe you’ve gone along with life and now realise you need to take control of some things. Maybe you could think about where you’d like to be in five years’ time, how you’d like to live, what you’d like to be feeling, and work backwards to see how you might achieve that. But to do that, you need to look not just at your immediate feelings but where they come from.You might find these podcasts helpful:What It Means to Belong; andShould we move?Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

Until one couple turned super sleuths …Sali HughesSun 21 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTShareOn Friday 13 June this year, a name that many people had been desperately trying to uncover for almost a decade was finally revealed. In a Northern Irish courtroom, a former vegan recipe content creator turned internet entrepreneur from Somerset was exposed as the hitherto anonymous proprietor of a gossip website named Tattle Life. His true identity is Sebastian Bond, and his unmasking may have kickstarted the biggest flurry of celebrity lawsuits since the Leveson inquiry revealed the extent of phone hacking in British tabloids.Tattle Life is a members-only forum that invites users to create and contribute to publicly readable threads of what it calls “commentary and critiques of people that choose to monetise their personal life as a business and release it into the public domain”.The site itself is monetised via Google adverts and ostensibly specialises in “calling out” (overwhelmingly female) people in the public eye, policing them on their online commercial integrity (adverts, brand deals, sponsorships and so on) and on their lifestyles, specifically their parenting, marriages, relationships and friendships. In practice, many of its targets are not by any measure well known – they’re small business owners, people with a modest online presence. Daily theorising on their personal and professional lives sits alongside mean-spirited commentary on stars such as Stacey Solomon, Katie Price, housekeeping influencer Mrs Hinch and huge vloggers such as Lydia Millen and Zoe Sugg. Northern Irish fashion retailer Donna Sands fell into the former category and it is she and her husband, Neil, a former Silicon Valley executive and serial entrepreneur, who have dealt the heaviest blow to the site since its inception more than eight years ago.It all began in January 2021, Donna says, when a friend told her she’d heard Donna’s name come up between colleagues at her office. Threads from a gossip site were being discussed. Donna, who had never heard of Tattle Life, went to look and found an extended rally of critical comments that became more extreme by the page. “I realised very quickly it went from, ‘She’s fat, she’s ugly, her wedding dress is so tacky’ to, ‘She looks so fat, maybe she’s pregnant’ and then to, ‘No, she couldn’t be pregnant because she’s actually too selfish to have a child.’” Comments turned to her women’s fashion business which, as is common for many independent retailers, Donna sometimes marketed on Instagram. “Then it was, ‘Oh, she must just buy it all off [low-cost fast fashion site] Shein and wrap it up in nice paper and send it out to her customers.’” This false claim was the first thing customers saw when they Googled the business. “So people lose trust in what the brand is and in the integrity of me as a business owner,” Donna says.I remember writing to Tattle Life, hitting send and feeling the humiliation of begging somebody to stop hurting your wifeSoon, the abuse took a darker turn. One Tattle Life user had followed the Sands to a house viewing, posted their location on the site and told users where the couple were moving before they’d even shared the news with their families. Another, a solicitor, approached the couple in a restaurant, said she was from Donna’s home town, accepted a drink and engaged them in conversation, before posting an embellished version of what was said on Tattle Life the same evening. The couple became nervous of anyone they didn’t know well. Neil says, “The straw that broke the camel’s back was when I wrote [to Tattle Life] and said, ‘I’m begging you to take this down.’ I can remember writing those emails and hitting send and feeling the humiliation of begging somebody to stop hurting your wife. It was having a big effect on my family. My parents are elderly and our families have nothing to do with any of this … ” And yet, Neil says, these family members, hardly “people that choose to monetise their personal life”, also apparently fell within the Tattle Life users’ ever-expanding remit and regularly featured in their discussions. Neil claims his pleading emails were stonewalled, as were those of multiple other Tattle Life victims. “It’s a really important thing that’s not being discussed,” Neil says. “That when this guy woke up in the morning, he opened his email and a couple of things would just go through his head, I guess. The first is, ‘I’m going to ignore those solicitors’ letters. I’m going to ignore the court order that says ‘persons unknown’ at the top of it. I’m going to ignore the mother who says that her son has cut himself today for the fourth time because he can’t put up with another day’s abuse … ”Just as most of Tattle Life targets are female, so, too, is the majority of its user base. Women, famous and not, are commonly torn down for their appearance and weight, as well as that of their children and partners. There is an obsession with “dishonesty” that frequently becomes nonsensical and unhinged. I also create content on Instagram as part of my job and have variously been accused of secretly being taller/shorter/fatter/thinner and of lying about my eye colour, having engaged in cosmetic surgery I haven’t had, my need to wear glasses and even the weather outside. If this was the full extent of the content, I suspect we’d all be delighted. But Tattle Life victims have also talked of deeply traumatic experiences inflicted on them by contributors.Reporting influencers and celebrities to social services for child abuse is believed by victims to be a common tactic (one content creator who wants to remain anonymous told me in 2020 that social services had turned up to her labour in hospital). Fake and malicious reviews are left for small businesses, services, books and products created by figures of Tattle Life hate, sometimes resulting in failure and closure. People have been maliciously accused of alcoholism or drug addiction. Some victims claim to have left their jobs or closed their businesses as a result of the harassment.Since 2019, I’ve spoken to more than two dozen victims (the Sands have been contacted by many more) who are too frightened to go on the record, or who can’t because of legal proceedings they’re bringing against the website. They’ve cited documented incidences of death certificates, mortgage deeds, home addresses, medical information, official correspondence, children’s photographs and their school details being obtained or leaked and posted on the site – all Googleable for public consumption. I have learned of three suicide attempts, including one by a model and mother I spoke to in her inpatient mental health facility, as a direct result of “unbearable” treatment by Tattle Life users. Neil and Donna Sands have even more testimony. People with disabilities, serious and terminal illnesses; their spouses, the bereaved, their children – all are considered fair game if connected to someone Tattle Life considers to be unlikable or dishonest. Those who describe the trauma of the abuse are generally accused of faking their feelings for attention and sympathy.View image in fullscreenCelebrities who have been targeted by Tattle Life include digital creator Lydia Millen …Photograph: Dave Benett/WireImageView image in fullscreenTV star Stacey Solomon …Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianView image in fullscreenmodel Katie Price …Photograph: Olivia Harris/The GuardianView image in fullscreenand entrepreneur and author Zoe Sugg.Photograph: David M Benett/Getty ImagesNonetheless, Tattle Life has, the Sands say, a history of either ignoring calls to remove defamatory posts or doubling down on them. Having failed to achieve any redress via this route, they began pursuing legal action, which in 2023 resulted in the award of £300,000 in damages, plus substantial legal costs, which means that Bond now owes them more than £1m. Describing Tattle’s business model as “solely aimed at making profit out of people’s misery”, Mr Justice McAlinden warned that “a day of reckoning will come for those behind Tattle Life and for those individuals who posted on Tattle Life”. A further ruling in June this year, finally allowing Bond’s name to be made public, also led to a flood of emails to Neil and Donna from other victims. They now have evidence of vast amounts of correspondence to the site’s email, forwarded to them by other Tattle Life targets after Neil appealed for proof that other victims’ pleas had been ignored. “We’ve heard so many. There was a pregnant mother who tried to take her life on Christmas Day because of what was happening on Tattle Life. There was another who ended up in a mental health facility, and the woman who was caring for her posted her patient notes on the site. The stories just make your head spin.”So how did the Sands succeed in identifying Bond, where so many victims, journalists and others hadn’t? Neil’s tech background “definitely helped”, he says, explaining that a network of tech contacts helped to investigate the digital architecture of Tattle Life, “but I would say that perseverance was probably what won this out. I remember going, ‘If I can find a thread to pull on this sweater, I’m going to pull it all apart.’ I just wasn’t letting somebody hurt my wife like that.” Much of the investigation involved grunt work and the forensic observation of Bond’s mostly pseudonymous online identities. Connections were made between Tattle Life and social media accounts; then to Bond’s own vegan recipe influencer account, @nestandglow, and other businesses. “And, yeah, we eventually got to his identity but, again, his identity is hitting a moving target with a dart. He has so many different pseudonyms. I think he had 14 emails and most of them were active.”The Sands were insistent that the uncovering of Bond had to be done correctly, in contrast to the ethical void and absence of due process on hate sites such as Tattle Life. They requested anonymity for all parties, including Bond, until a verdict was delivered. Neil says, “By requesting anonymity the whole way through it, we weren’t getting people’s hopes up. So we had to make that choice every time we went into court to say, ‘Let’s just keep this reporting restriction on, so that this guy isn’t impacted if it’s not him.’”One of the more frustrating aspects of previous social media pushback against Tattle Life, and specifically attempts to unmask those behind it, is the way some victims have taken to doxing suspected users, admins and owners, using the same ham-fisted, scattershot and premature tactics as the people they seek to admonish. One online witch-hunt concluded with a novelist and her sister, both entirely innocent and uninvolved, being “exposed” on Instagram, where they received so much abuse that they closed their accounts. The Sands were determined not to engage in the same hypocrisy. There were also practical benefits to keeping Bond anonymous, Neil says: “There was a good chance that if we had raised his name earlier, he would have pulled the site down and run. And a lot of people wouldn’t have seen their justice.”This guy is going to throw his users under the bus. They’re scared and they should be. The internet’s not an anonymous placeThe Sands have successfully submitted an application to the courts obliging Bond to reveal the email addresses of some of Tattle Life’s most egregious users, who needed nothing more than that to start posting anonymously on the site. They want people to know that there will be repercussions for online abuse, harassment and defamation, and that no one is truly anonymous. I’m not sure many care. Since I was first contacted by a family blogger in 2019 and told I was a target on a “hate site”, I have identified about 30 of the women who, at various points, have spent up to 16 hours a day criticising me and, much more upsettingly, making up stories about me, my family and my relationships. Some fled when they realised they had been uncovered, a small number wrote to me later to apologise, some remain while pretending to the group that they haven’t yet been caught, but mostly they are unrepentant and happy to continue as before. They are teachers, nurses, solicitors, accountants, marketing professionals, college lecturers and at-home mothers living in Orkney, Coventry, Cambridge, London, the US, Australia. What they all absolutely believe is that they are on the right side of the argument; that they are merely “expressing an opinion” on their subjects and their loved ones. Meanwhile, victims are expected to have a thicker skin, and advised, “If you don’t like it, don’t look.”View image in fullscreenDonna and Neil Sands, whose determination finally unmasked the man behind Tattle Life.Photograph: Rob Durston/The GuardianNeil and Donna Sands reject this position. Neil says, “It’s not regular human experience that anything you do has this centralised hub of hate, targeted specifically around what you’ve put out into the world and that you should be just fine with it.” Donna adds, “They say, ‘Oh, well, don’t go on to the site. They [the site’s targets] must be highly self-centred.’ Nobody wants to go on to the site but to see if there’s something really untrue … I always felt like I’d rather know than have people thinking that behind my back.”Another issue with the often well-meant advice not to look is that it ignores the tendency for both users and content to follow subjects off the site, around the internet and into everyday life. Although I had a third party monitoring the site and screen-grabbing anything that I might need in the future, I personally became so obsessive in avoiding it that I bought blocking software, and asked my husband to Google anything I ever needed where there was even a small chance of a Tattle Life search result. Yet still I would hear from Tattle Lifers who couldn’t resist bringing their “opinions” to my social media accounts, “supporters” who felt the need to tell me what was being said, and even complete strangers in the street. I will never forget the humiliation and panic caused by a teacher at my son’s school approaching me to say how sorry she was about “all the horrible stuff about you” that she’d read on Tattle Life. Or how several Tattle Life users – one of them a schoolteacher – persistently attempted to follow my then young children’s locked Instagram accounts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Most painfully, they interpreted my deliberate decision not to post about my children as a sign that I didn’t much care about them. Unable to cope with the constant harassment, personal embarrassment and guilt at having put my loved ones in the line of fire, I seriously considered quitting my job and changing careers. I reduced my social circle dramatically, became nervous of going out and had to seek (ongoing) medical and psychological treatment. All of which Tattle Life users excitedly scanning this piece will doubtless be discounting as exaggeration, a just price for an online presence, or simply untrue.No one is beyond criticism or unkindness, and I am used to the combative and unpleasant nature of internet discourse. I am not kept awake at night by a stranger hating my clothes. But the lies, embellishments and unfounded speculation are unforgivable and damaging. “We weren’t shy of someone saying you’re fat or you’re ugly,” Donna says. “It’s not nice and it is not necessary because we’re all adults. These are 30-, 40-, 50-year-old women. We can take a lot of the flak, but it’s when stories are made up and people believe it and change their opinion of you, which undoubtedly they will.”For a site purporting to be obsessed with honesty, Tattle Life appears to take a hard line on attempts to correct the record. There is much testimony from people who have jumped on the site to defend the subject with facts, and have been immediately blocked and deleted. Positive takes dilute the hate and may prompt reflection on the part of the community. They are bad for business. Neil’s theory is that this is why Bond at one point closed the site to new members. “He didn’t need them. They would turn down the volume within a thread. Somebody would defend their brother or sister, their wife or whatever, and then the thread would go quiet, because there was a voice of reason in it. And so new members were a problem for him. As long as he had the same people active on the site, saying the same crazy, hateful, clickbaity stuff, that was great for him. It was a great business model.”Now, maybe not so much. Following the ruling on the Sands’ case, Tattle Life added a disclaimer to the site, letting members know that the proprietor is not responsible for the legality of user content or supportive of abuse. Neil believes this is a signal that users are on their own if someone decides to sue them. He points out that the traditional model of social media relies on trust between the owner of the site and the user. “But this guy, as soon as he gets a chance, he’s going to throw his users under the bus.” Neil claims to have evidence that traffic on the site has slowed dramatically and users are leaving. In fear of legal and professional repercussions, perhaps? “They are scared – and they should be. The internet’s not an anonymous place and if this guy can be found, every one of those people can be.”The day he has to walk up the high court steps will be the first time anybody ever answered for online hate as a businessI ask whether remorseful Tattle Lifers have been in touch with them. I received a handful of apologetic emails myself after Iwent public with my experienceswith Tattle Life and even met one of my former trolls for BBC Radio 4’sFile on 4. To her credit, she took full responsibility for her actions and said – I felt, sincerely – that she could pinpoint the exact timeline of difficulties in her own life simply by reading her vitriolic posts on the site. Donna Sands is suspicious of the sudden regret of fallen Tattlers. “Of course, the first thing everyone says is, ‘Oh, you know what? I was in a really bad headspace and I shouldn’t have said it, and my career is so important. I’m really, really sorry, and I’ll make a charitable donation.’ And you’re like, ‘Well, you’ve been doing this for years and laughing … ’”Neil adds, “I know lots of people are coming out of the woodwork now, being like, ‘Oh, it’s my mental health.’ But so many victims, for these last eight or whatever years, their mental health was never a second thought to these people.”However vile, vindictive and dishonest a post on a hate site may be, there is an uncomfortable ethical dilemma attached to outing its author. Will anyone really think well of someone exposing an NHS nurse who got carried away? Neil says they are aware of the potential for moral hazard: “We’ve always been very positive people. We are not big personalities by any means. And I would hate for us to be the couple that you’re afraid to say something to in a bar in case you get a legal letter … But I can tell you that there is a deep thirst in those who were victimised for that user list. It won’t be impossible to do, but I think we have to be careful because I think we’re better than this … The internet is better than this. Human beings are better than this.“The thing is,” Neil adds, “they’re not all bad people.” But they are, he insists, helping to make something very bad. “They’ve all enriched that guy. I can tell you that much. I think it would engender a huge mistrust in society if you dragged every one of these people out and said they’re all trolls and no one’s to be trusted. But the most egregious ones, like the psychiatric nurse who posted the patient notes, that’s not even the fat end of the wedge. That’s the middle of the wedge. There are people who encourage others to take their lives on there.” Donna cuts in, “There’s a girl in my town and she had cancer, and there was a JustGiving page for her, and they trolled it all the way up until she died. And then after that, I was like, what are they going to say now? And it was, ‘Oh look, the grieving husband, there he is!’ They’re laughing about the grieving husband.”You be the judge: should my boyfriend stop trolling rightwing social media accounts?Read moreSo while they set about uncovering the identities of the worst Tattle trolls, what’s the Sands’ long-term plan? “We want somebody to be accountable,” Neil says. “The day that he has to walk up the high court steps will be a big day for everybody because it’ll be the first time anybody ever answered for online hate as a business.”In August, Bond suffered another blow when his challenge to the court order freezing £1.8m of his assets was rejected. Disclosing that the Tattle founder was facing some 40 further lawsuits, Bond’s counsel unsuccessfully argued that it would be unfair to force his client so sell bitcoin holdings of £1.6m to pay for ongoing legal representation, due to the capital gains tax he would incur in the process. A further court date is scheduled. Bond’s appearance, Neil believes, would provide a much-needed focus for “a lot of victims who have no place to vent their kind of frustration, their anger, or to point at any sort of closure for what’s happened to them”.Next, they want Tattle Life to be shut down. The business model of monetising somebody’s pain has to go away, they say. Crucially, they want the nine major UK and Ireland mobile phone networks to de-list the site, making it inaccessible by smartphone, and for Google to suspend Tattle’s ad revenue from platforming its roving ads. If that happened, the hate would become unprofitable, especially to a company that owes large sums of money to the Sands and potentially many more victims who say they’re gearing up for legal action.The Sands want Bond to be compelled to appear in court, to finally face his victims from the dock and know that he is being judged, just as Tattle Life victims have been for the last eight years. “And I’m very excited for that,” Neil says. “No matter which way it goes, it’s a victory because he never thought for one moment that anyone would catch him.”Explore more on these topicsOnline abuseSocial mediaDigital mediaMedia lawInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to cook and eat with the minimum of squalor – and the maximum of safetyAlice WilkinsonSun 21 Sep 2025 03.15 EDTLast modified on Sun 21 Sep 2025 03.17 EDTShareThe communal kitchen is the beating heart of a houseshare. In the sitcom Friends, it’s where Monica gets a turkey stuck on her head; in New Girl, it’s where Nick repeatedly fixes the kitchen sink whenever he’s “going through stuff”. It’s the natural place for drunken deep and meaningful chats, first kisses and epic fallouts. It’s also where many people discover how truly disgusting having housemates can be. It can often feel like you’re taking your health into your own hands when you cook in a shared kitchen.It’s something the rising number of seasoned house-sharers among us know too well. While the exact number of house-sharers in the UK is hard to quantify precisely,Spare Room reportthe number of people in the UK looking to rent via the flat-sharing platform has tripled between 2013 and 2023, and further reports indicate11.5% of house sharers are over 40. It’s also something this year’s fresher students who are opting to live in university halls are about to find out.“Shared living is a real melting pot of practices and habits and people exposing each other to risks in different ways – usually in a space with little ventilation,” saysDr David Megson, a reader in chemistry and environmental forensics at Manchester Metropolitan University.View image in fullscreenFriends for life?Photograph: Posed by models; Maskot/Getty ImagesDr Alison Cottell, a microbiologist lecturing at the University of Surrey, agrees that life in a shared kitchen is about weighing up the risks. “Bacteria are everywhere, and it’s normal to come into contact with them every day, but you want to avoid spreading anything high-risk.”Having lived in four university house shares and eight professional house shares, I’ve seen a real spectrum of kitchen crimes committed. But how worried should you be about someone else’s disgusting habits? Are they simply annoying, or could they make you unwell? The chemist and the microbiologist give their verdicts.Burning food on to the panView image in fullscreenIt’s unsightly – but is it dangerous?Photograph: Willowpix/Getty Images/iStockphotoYes, burning food createsacrylamide, although it is unlikely to cause cancer, as you would need to consume a large amount. “The black colour on burnt food isn’t the specific toxic substance,” says Megson, “but it is a location where toxic chemicals can be created during the burning process. So scraping the burnt bit in the bin and eating the unburnt bit is my advice.” He has a vivid memory of a housemate scraping a non-stick pan with a metal fork. “I found it painful even then and I didn’t know much about the world of forever chemicals.”Using a metal utensil scrapes off the top layer of Pfas, the chemicals used to make the non-stick coating on a pan, he explains, meaning you end up eating them. Studies have linked these “forever chemicals”, which are almost impossible to break down, toinfertilityandcancer, as well as other diseases. “Using the pan at too high a temperature is also going to release some of those chemicals,” he says. While most non-stick pans come with a warning not to heat them above 250C or 300C, this is hard to monitor. “If something’s burnt to the bottom of the pan, don’t scrape it off with your fork. Let it soak it and wash it up gently,” is Megson’s advice.You could try purchasing wooden utensils and advising your housemates to use the non-stick pan on the smaller ring on the hob – or, like Megson and I, you could get a pan of your own, take care of it, and keep it in your allotted cupboard.Home-curing meatView image in fullscreenDo not wash chicken under the tap.Photograph: Kinga Krzeminska/Getty Images“There’s a whole pig on the kitchen table and chunks of it being cured on a rack in the fridge.” A text I’ll never forget and hopefully one I’ll never receive again. A housemate, getting experimental in the kitchen, was butchering a pig and massaging it with salt in order to dry cure it himself.“You’re likely to end up with a really stinky kitchen,” says Cottell, who explains that, as well as the bacteria that will grow if it’s not properly cured (the salt is meant to dry the meat out, so bacteria can’t survive), there might be pathogens (disease-causing organisms) that multiply on raw meat and make you ill if you eat them. If you see flies around it, it’s a problem. They’ll carry these germs to other surfaces and foods.If you have a housemate who’s into fermenting vegetables, it’s fungi you’ve got to watch out for, says Cottell. “When done correctly, fermenting creates an acidic environment in which many bacterial pathogens cannot grow. Fungi, however, can reproduce in acidic conditions. While they’re unlikely to infect a person when ingested, they may produce toxins that can cause illness if they’re consumed.”Handling meat is one of Cottell’s main concerns in a shared kitchen setting. “TheFood Standards Agencyundertook a study on food-hygiene practices two years ago,” she says, “and found that twice the number of students were not adhering to health recommendations such as those around handling meats, compared with the rest of the population. Students were found to be more likely to engage in risky practices like washing raw chicken under the tap or not storing meat properly” – that is, on the bottom shelf of the fridge in an airtight container. Chicken can harbour campylobacter and salmonella, and washing it sprays bacteria over large areas.The advice? Don’t rinse chicken under the tap. Cook meat thoroughly. Use different chopping boards for raw meat and ready-to-eat food. And, if you are going to attempt to cure meat, do your research, cover it properly and regularly wipe the surfaces.Not doing the laundryView image in fullscreenMusty smell? It might be the bacteria in damp clothing.Photograph: Anastasiia Krivenok/Getty ImagesIt smells distinctly musty, but is dirty laundry actually harmful? “Dirty clothes left for days in a laundry basket are unsavoury, but there aren’t many direct foodborne health risks here,” says Cottell. That’s the case even if the basket is in the kitchen.What you can smell is bacteria trapped in the damp fibres. “Bacteria aren’t going to leap out on to your surfaces or into your food,” she reassures. “In the unlikely event that soiled clothing comes directly into contact with something you’re about to eat, that could cause contamination, which might cause a very short-lived sickness.” If someone musty-smelling is cooking for you, ask them to roll up their sleeves.Leaving dirty dinner plates to soak … for a weekView image in fullscreenWashing up may be tedious but is also essential.Photograph: Olga Rolenko/Getty ImagesThe plates might be growing mould, even attracting flies – and, when the washing up is finally tackled, it’s not always particularly thorough.“Health risks associated with leaving unwashed crockery on worktops or to soak in the sink really depend on what the items have been used for. A plate on which raw meat has been defrosted and then left in a sink of warm dishwater poses a significantly higher risk than one that has been used for a piece of toast,” notes Cottell. That’s because of the bacteria on raw meat that cause illness.And the plate with rotting food on the side? “The bacteria that cause food to rot create horrible smells and make the food unpalatable,” she says. “Such bacteria do not usually cause infections, but may produce waste products as they break down the food they are growing on. It’s these waste products that can cause someone to feel ill if they eat them.” So don’t be tempted to finish off your housemate’s mouldy pizza.Keep an eye on how well dishcloths are being rinsed, too. “They are renowned for harbouring large numbers of bacteria,” says Cottell. “If you have wiped an area where you’ve prepared raw meat and then another area that you’re going to eat from, or prepare ready-to-eat food on, you’re contaminating it with potentially harmful bacteria.”Drying your dishcloths and teatowels well is key, she adds. “These bacteria can live in damp conditions for a couple of days, but they won’t survive on a dry surface for long. Boil the cloths to kill off pathogens and use soap. Soap is crucial because it breaks down the fats and membranes in viruses and bacteria, which ensure they don’t survive.”Vaping indoorsView image in fullscreenBeware second-hand smoke and toxin-laden surfaces.Photograph: Radu Bighian/Getty ImagesIt’s quite common now to sit opposite a housemate and watch them alternate between tokes on their blue-raspberry vape and forkfuls of their meal. It’s a wild ride for their tastebuds – but does it also pose health risks for you?“When it comes to vapes, it’s a complete lottery,” says Megson.One study looked at 50 different vape brandsand found 113 different chemicals across them. “It’s a complete spectrum of the unknown. They’re chemically complex mixtures and, when heated, there are going to be some potentially nasty compounds. Having it in that enclosed environment is far from ideal. If there was anyone vaping in my house, I’d ask them to go ask outside in the same way I would if they were smoking a cigarette.”Even if your housemate vapes in their own room, it’s not good for your health, as it contributes to air pollution in the house.

Aside from the fact you’re putting on a dinner party for mice, moisture from things like bean juice allow harmful bacteria to live longer. And, as the food rots, it will create toxins that, if ingested, might cause illness. But, from a microbiologist’s perspective, the main risk is contamination.Cottell says: “Pathogens like norovirus and staphylococci can spread via food if people haven’t washed their hands properly [when preparing it]. If you’re not wiping the sides often and you’re living with people who have poor hand hygiene, who don’t wash them after going to the loo or blowing their nose, you’re risking pathogens from the surface they touch contaminating food.”Keep the surfaces clean by wiping them with warm, soapy water before preparing your own meals. “When you get bacteria like salmonella on a surface that’s clean, it quickly dries out and won’t usually be able to cause disease for long,” says Cottell. “But drop it on a kitchen surface (microwave, fridge, oven or table) where there’s lots of dirt, fat and oil residues, and pathogens survive much longer.”Relying on air freshenersView image in fullscreenManufacturers don’t have to list ingredients.Photograph: George Mdivanian/AlamyA valiant attempt at domesticity that doesn’t require doing any actual washing? There’s always one housemate who burns incense 24/7, or insists on a plug-in air freshener. “If I ever go to a hotel, the first thing I do is take the scented plug out,” says Megson. “Because it’s a chemical cocktail.”Ingredients in air freshenersdon’t have to be listedand many of them contain potentially harmful compounds, with some studies indicating thatregular use can even affect heart healthover time. “It might be nice to cover the unpleasant smells in a shared home, but it can really irritate people’s respiratory and sensory systems. Candles incense,oudare the same. Anything you’re lighting could contain and create some nasty chemicals,” says Megson.It won’t smell as exotic as sandalwood and jasmine, but opening windows and staying on top of the cleaning is the best advice.Never clearing out the shared fridgeView image in fullscreenYou can keep your own shelf immaculate – but what about everyone else?Photograph: Kilito Chan/Getty ImagesAfter moving into a house share, you’ll usually be allotted a kitchen cupboard and shelf in the fridge all to yourself. Keep yours as clean as you like, but you can’t escape the wrinkly peppers and furry yoghurts that lurk elsewhere in shared fridges.Cottell admits the smell of rotting food is nauseating, but she’s less concerned about the “food-spoiling bacteria” that are creating these sulphurous odours because it means we’re aware food has gone off and are therefore less inclined to eat it. “I’m more worried about the hidden bacteria that you can’t taste or smell,” she says.Leftover rice and pasta in the fridge is safe as long as it’s eaten cold, but red flags arise if it’s reheated, because of bacillus cereus. “It’s a soil-borne microbe which is common in rice and, when reheated, can lead to a short but intense sickness bug.”Don’t rinse raw chicken: nine food safety tips from microbiologistsRead moreBut raw meat in the fridge is the biggest red flag of all. “Campylobacter and salmonella are spread predominantly through poultry and cause nasty diarrhoeal diseases. Then there are many different strains of enteropathogenic E coli too, generally spread through meat that’s not cooked properly.”It’s a problem in fridges if meat juice drips down on to ready-to-eat food. Ideally, you would store raw meat at the bottom of the fridge, but if you’re allotted the middle shelf, that’s tricky.The solution? Keep your meat in a sealed container and ask your housemates to do the same. If they’re not playing ball, fight your way to the top shelf.How to Stay Sane in a House Share by Alice Wilkinson is out now (DK Red, £14.99) and £1.99 on Kindle throughout September.

The hundreds of responses we received told their own story of polarisation.While many condemned the event as a “scary” indication of a country “sleepwalking to fascism”, others were emphatic that the event was not “far right”, and had been attended by ordinary people from all walks of life in defence of “British values”.Alongside passionate defences of Britain’s diversity, however, anti-immigrant sentiments were shared openly.Disappointment in government was one point of agreement. This week, shortly beforePresident Donald Trump’s state visit, the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government told the Guardian that social cohesion work begun by Angela Rayner as secretary of state would continue.Peter, a 35-year-old philosophy lecturer fromLondon, said: “I’m exactly the type of person likely to be labelled part of the ‘Metropolitan liberal elite’ – and ‘part of the problem’.“Having said that, I grew up in a highly Eurosceptic area [and] the protests came on the back of a trip home where I immediately noticed that the town I grew up in was plastered in union jacks and St George’s crosses – even our local Chinese restaurant.“This made me realise, to a point of considerable discomfort, that I’m potentially out of whack with a lot of other people.”Sarah, also from London said: “This was not a far-right rally. This was a free speech protest. Given [the number] of people in attendance, the amount of violence was very low.“I have mobility issues and dislike crowd situations, otherwise I would have attended. However, if future protests are held, I will seriously consider attending them.”View image in fullscreenCounter-protesters at the ‘unite the kingdom’ event in London.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/Zuma/RexAn anonymous reader, 60, said: “What we are seeing in London and around the UK with the ‘unite the kingdom’ campaign seems to be a consequence of more moderate voices staying silent in the face of a deliberate campaign of misinformation and agitation by the far right.“Into a vacuum where there ought to be clear statements by leaders from all walks of life about our values of compassion and inclusion has flowed US-style fabrication of stories and manipulation of people who are discontented. There needs to be a counter-narrative from the non-rightwing parties.“People see the rising extremism in the USA and it spreads here unchallenged, abetted by out-of-control social media.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ideally, I’m hoping that there are huge changes in the voting system and we move toPR[proportional representation].”Lee Newman, 48, from Kent, said: “I was there Saturday. I loved it. We are not racist like the media and government want to label us. We are all concerned about how broken our country is.”Bruce Webb, 54, from the Isle of Wight, said an “upbeat” day“turned ugly” at Whitehall, where the scenes he witnessed made him “extremely thankful for the police protecting us”.Webb, who had joined the counter-protest: added: “I came up to the march to defend the rights of asylum seekers. The most unique and depressing experience was seeing two sets of British groups fighting and shouting.“A huge amount of the crowd were up for a colourful, patriotic march, but the presence ofTommy Robinson, Katie Hopkins and Elon Muskgave the feeling the day was a surreal political event.”A reader described being on the train with ”unite the kingdom” protesters travelling hundreds of miles down to London from the north-west. She added: “They were very jolly, clear in their own minds that they were doing the right thing. I only hope visiting multicultural London going about its normal, everyday life gave some of the thousands of ’unite the kingdom’ visitors as much of a wake-up call as we had on Saturday.”Explore more on these topicsThe far rightTommy RobinsonLondonRaceImmigration and asylumProtestfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They would train at Batuk, the British army base that still operates today, close to Nanyuki, a poor market town in the east of the country.In a town that struggles with poverty, unemployment and limited economic opportunities, many women in Nanyuki would turn to selling sex for money – British soldiers being a lucrative source of trade.Agnes Wanjiru, a 21-year-old hairdresser and mother to a five-month-old baby, was among them. On the night she disappeared, in late March 2012, she was last seen in the bar of the Lion’s Court hotel, a popular haunt with British soldiers, where she had been drinking with two friends, Florence Nyaguthii and Susan Nyambura.The next morning, when Agnes failed to return home, her family and friends began looking for her. They spent weeks searching, until, about two months later, Agnes’s body was found in a septic tank in the grounds of the hotel.In the years since then, her disappearance has been the subject of a number of criminal investigations and inquests, Agnes’s family campaigning to get answers while caring for Stacey, the daughter she left behind.Over the course of 13 and a half years, the campaign was spearheaded by her niece Esther Njoki and sister Rose Wanyua Wanjiku, who saw power pass between six prime ministers and seven defence secretaries in the UK, and three presidents in Kenya, before they saw any progress.Their campaign was cast into the international spotlight, and was given added momentum, when the Sunday Times, almost four years ago to the day, began reporting on Agnes’s case.Serving and former soldiers who were in Kenya at the time Agnes disappeared spoke out, with several coming forward to name a suspect in the case.It put renewed pressure on the governments of both countries, amid anger and protests in Kenya over Britain’s continued military presence in the region. Separately, the renewed interest in the case also resulted in a fresh police investigation, led by Kenyan detectives, with the support of the UK’s royal military police.With jurisdiction in the case resting with Kenya, detectives flew out from Nairobi to the UK to question suspects and witnesses, many of them British soldiers.After almost a decade and a half with no arrests, no court appearances, and no convictions, it seemed unlikely that there would ever be a breakthrough in the case.Yet on Tuesday, the high court in Nairobi issued an arrest warrant for Robert James Purkiss, a former British soldier, originally from Greater Manchester.It is only an arrest warrant, with the charges set before the Kenyan court not proven. Purkisswould need to be extradited in order to face those charges.It means the Kenyan government will first need to submit an extradition request to the UK Home Office, which will need to be certified by the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, and sent to the courts, with extradition cases normally heard at Westminster magistrates court.For a suspect to be extradited, the court must be satisfied there are reasonable grounds for believing the conduct described is an extradition offence, and only then will a warrant be issued in the UK and a suspect arrested.A date would then be set for an extradition hearing in front of British judge, which Purkisswould have the opportunity to contest, before the separate criminal proceedings could take place in Kenya. The case is next due to be mentioned at court in Nairobi on 21 October.If Purkissis successfully extradited to face trial in Kenya, the criminal proceedings would look different to those in the UK; the jury system was abolished in Kenya at the end of colonial rule.Similar to in a UK criminal case, a defendant has the opportunity to plead guilty or not guilty, and if a case goes to trial, the prosecution and defence will set out their respective cases, with the opportunity to cross-examine each other’s witnesses.However, it is the presiding judge who makes a decision in a case, rather than a citizen jury, with legal expert assessors, who assist the judge in determining facts, used in some cases, particularly more serious trials.Neither the Home Office nor the Ministry of Defence has disclosed whether a request for extradition has yet been submitted by the Kenyan government.“Our thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru and we remain absolutely committed to helping them secure justice,” a UK government spokesperson said.“We understand that the Kenyan director of public prosecutions has determined that a British national should face trial in relation to the murder of Ms Wanjiru in 2012.“This is subject to ongoing legal proceedings and we will not comment further at this stage.”Explore more on these topicsKenyaAfricaMilitaryExtraditionUK criminal justiceanalysisShareReuse this content"

Long live Brazil!” the Golden Globe-nominated actor Wagner Moura told a sea of protesters in Salvador, the capital of his home state, Bahia.Moura, the star of the Netflix drama Narcos, hailed the “extraordinary moment” his country’s democracy was experiencing after Bolsonaro’s historic conviction – a contrast with the democratic backsliding in the US under Bolsonaro’s re-elected ally Donald Trump.In São Paulo, tens of thousands gathered outside the city’s art museum and hoisted a giant Brazilian flag over their heads – a patriotic response to Trump’s unsuccessful attempts to interfere in Bolsonaro’s trial with a pressure campaign of tariffs and sanctions.At a rally in Belo Horizonte, local singer Fernanda Takai denounced the “shameless” manoeuvres to help Bolsonaro dodge jail and politicians avoid being held to account for their misdeeds. “We need to take a stand, to show how angry we are,” Takaitoldthe newspaper Estado de Minas.In the capital, Brasília, where Bolsonaro is currently under house arrest, thousands assembled near the congress and supreme court buildings that were trashed by rightwing radicals on 8 January 2023 at the climax of the former president’s coup attempt.There were also protests overseas, including in Berlin, Lisbon and London, where demonstrators gathered outside parliament to demand Bolsonaro be jailed.Before the rallies – Brazil’s largest pro-democracy demonstrations in years – Buarque, who was forced into exile in Italy in the late 1960s during the military dictatorship, spurned the idea of an amnesty for Bolsonaro.“We do not want a repeat of the 1979 amnesty … which meant that nobody was punished [for the regime’s crimes],” the celebrated singer-songwritertoldthe news website UOL.Buarque rejected the idea that granting Bolsonaro and his seven co-conspirators an amnesty would reduce political tensions. “It was the putschists who committed the crime. We [democrats] owe them nothing,” the singer said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroProtestLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

ThePhilippineshas an average of 20 tropical cyclones each year, making it one of the most vulnerable countries to natural disasters.“Our purpose is not to destabilise but to strengthen our democracy,” Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David, the head of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, said in a statement, calling on the public to demand accountability.Protests were largely peaceful, though police arrested 72 people, including 20 minors, in two separate incidents.At least 39 officers were injured, and a trailer that was being used as a barricade was set ablaze, according to a spokesperson. Maj Hazel Asilo told AFP that it was unclear whether those arrested were “protesters or just people who are causing trouble”.View image in fullscreenProtesters clash with riot police during the rally in Manila.Photograph: Francis R Malasig/EPAA morning demonstration at a park in Manila drew nearly 50,000 people, according to city estimates, while thousands more joined an afternoon rally at the capital’s EDSA thoroughfare.“They are draining the people’s money while citizens suffer from floods, their homes being swept away, while officials ride private planes, live in mansions,” Manuel Dela Cerna, 58, told AFP.Protesters have called for misappropriated funds to be returned, and for those implicated tobe jailed.The protests echo outrage over alleged government corruption and inequality elsewhere in Asia, including in Nepal, where a gen Z-led protest movementtoppled the government of Nepalthis month, and Indonesia, whereprotests recently eruptedover privileges given to lawmakers.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr revealed the flood-control corruption scandal in his annual state of the nation address, and later established an independent commission to investigate the allegations.In a separate inquiry in the senate, the owner of a construction company accused nearly 30 lawmakers and officials of taking cash payments, in televised testimonies that have gripped the country. Past TV interviews given by the owner’s family, showing their luxurious lifestyle, have also resurfaced, fuelling public anger.Marcos Jr has sought to placate the public, expressing support for the protests.“Do you blame them for going out on the streets?” he asked reporters at a press conference this week. “If I weren’t president, I might be out in the streets with them.“Of course, they are enraged. They are angry, I’m angry. We should all be angry, because what is happening is not right.”Sunday’s protests were held on a historically significant date: on 21 September in 1972 president Marcos’s father and namesake, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, imposed martial law. He held on to power for 14 more years, and is accused ofplundering as much as $10bn.Marcos Jr has promised that inquiries into the flooding scandal would spare “no sacred cows”.The senate president, Francis Escudero, and house speaker, Martin Romualdez, Marcos Jr’s cousin, have stepped down in the fallout from the scandal.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesAsia PacificProtestSouth and central AsiaFloodingnewsShareReuse this content"

Wait for it.”Starmerin his announcement on Sundaysaid the goal was to “revive the hope of peace and a two-state solution”. Yet Israel has made it clear that it views a two-state solution already as defunct, with Netanyahu saying bluntly: “There will be no Palestinian state.”The remarks came at a ceremony marking the expansion of theE1 project between Jerusalem and Ma’ale Adumim, which would effectively cut the Palestinian-controlled sectors of the West Bank in two.Smotrich said last month that he believed the plans would “bury” the idea of a Palestinian state.Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaCanadaIsrael-Gaza waranalysisShareReuse this content"

Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, the “rock star” of this wing of politics, implored audiences to join the Liberals.So far, so reasonable. After May’s election drubbing, a further splitting of conservative voters into more fringe parties won’t help the Coalition. As Cpac founder Andrew Cooper said, the Liberals have “hardly any members and the average age is 65”.The problem for Ley, however, was the solution from speakers including her parliamentary colleagues – Price, Matt Canavan, Alex Antic, Angus Taylor, Bridget McKenzie – was not a call to unite behind her. Indeed, Ley was barely mentioned (except to audience boos during Hanson’s speech).Instead, Abbott called for party “reform”; Price, recently dumped by Ley from the shadow ministry, asked attenders to help “shape” the party; several speakers mooted alliances between the Coalition and Hanson.Cpac, as it always does, wants Liberals lurching further right.View image in fullscreenOne Nation unveiled a working pinball machine themed for their ‘Please Explain’ cartoon series, depicting Pauline Hanson as a caped superhero fighting a cyborg version of energy minister Chris Bowen.Photograph: Josh Butler/The Guardian“We’ve got a battle to get the conservative side of politics back together, and this is the beginning,” said Cpac chair Warren Mundine.The Sky News host Rowan Dean floated: “Liberals, Nationals, One Nation working together.”It’s important to note here: Cpac is not mainstream Australia. It’s not even the mainstream of the Liberals.Some in the Coalition see the several hundred attenders at Brisbane’s Star casino – overwhelmingly but not exclusively older white people, starstruck by News Corp opinionistas and obsessed with Trump’s Maga America – as the party “base”. But despite being held in the LNP heartland of Queensland, most Liberals stayed away.Outside those on the speaking lineup, there only appeared to be one other Coalition MP in the venue. There were more One Nation parliamentarians in the crowd.This is the Jacinta Price wing of the Coalition, the Sky After Dark faction, unlikely to praise a more moderate voice like Ley; indeed even hard-right Peter Dutton’s campaign was criticised by speakers for being “Labor-lite”. Some more moderate Liberals are frustrated at continually being dragged off-message by harder-right colleagues, as Ley’s team seeks to chart a more mainstream path to attract “middle Australia” voters instead of focusing on imported culture wars pushed by commentators and former MPs now in media roles.But the discussion about the future of the Coalition is a legitimate one. Senior Coalition voices are alarmed at shedding support to moderate “teal” independents, and on their right to One Nation. The recent Newspoll delivered the Coalition’s lowest-ever primary, just 27%, while One Nation had risen to 10%. Dutton left the Coalition a smouldering wreck with just 43 lower House seats. Something needs to shift if the Coalition can survive as a meaningful force.Hanson, in a lower-profile slot on Sunday afternoon, claimed One Nation was “the real opposition”. Having heard discussion about whether One Nation should link up with the Coalition, she said she would “no longer be the bridesmaid”.Deputy Liberal leader Ted O’Brien, with the weekend’s toughest assignment in representing Ley’s more moderate position, railed against Labor’s economic policies and claimed “our values are under attack”; but he was constantly heckled, numerous audience members jeering “what are you going to do about it” and “when are you going to start?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While Cpac speakers demanded the Coalition talk more about migration, support Australia’s “Judeo-Christian” heritage, and oppose Labor tax changes, many calls for “leadership” to oppose climate targets were top of the agenda.Sure, the weekend wasn’t all a battle for theLiberal partysoul.Matt Schlapp, Cpac’s American chair, joked “I thought net zero was Biden’s IQ?”; Liz Truss, of the blink-and-you’ll-miss-it British prime ministership, claimed she was “cancelled” and removed in a “globalist coup”.Numerous speakers praised murdered conservative activist Charlie Kirk, with a tribute wall for written messages.One Nation unveiled a working pinball machine themed for their Please Explain cartoon series, depicting Hanson as a caped superhero fighting a cyborg version of the energy minister, Chris Bowen. The former Nationals MP Christensen, now with conservative advocacy group CitizenGo, set up a photo wall like a police mugshot for people to pose with a sign reading “eSafety thought police”.But the conference’s main thread was clear: what now for Liberals?The answer, according to Cpac, was obvious.Every Cpac conference has heard that the Liberals’ mounting election failures are because leaders aren’t rightwing enough. Scott Morrison in 2022, Dutton in 2025, and a string of Liberal state election defeats, according to recent editions of Cpac, came because they were too progressive. The then Liberal vice-president Teena McQueen said in 2022they should “rejoice” as teals defeated moderates.Cpac volunteers walked through the crowd distributing copies of conservative magazine The Spectator, handing out one with a front cover bearing a caricature of Ley and the headline “Leybor Lite”.The dissonance of the message at Cpac was stark. On the one hand, Abbott, Mundine and othersexplicitly apologised for a “terrible” election campaign; on the other, speakers praised Dutton, saying the Coalition must double down on his strategy, on nuclear and Trump-style politics and opposing climate action.Admitting a bad outcome, but repeating the same strategy.Explore more on these topicsCoalitionAustralian politicsPauline HansonSussan LeyLiberal partyanalysisShareReuse this content"

We must end the cycle of violence,” he said.“The terrorist atrocities that occurred byHamason 7 October ensure and underline why Hamas can play no role in the future Palestinian state. But just as the Jewish people have a homeland in Israel, Palestinians have a legitimate aspiration for their own homeland as well.”The plan is designed to build renewed momentum for a two-state solution, including a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the hostages from terror attacks orchestrated by Hamas.In August, Australia said it would join the international push led by France, promptingfury from Israeli’s leader Benjamin Netanyahuand possible retribution from the US president, Donald Trump.Republicans warn Australia of ‘punitive measures’ over recognition of Palestinian stateRead moreAlbanese will speak at a major conference on a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and Hamas this week.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe establishment of an embassy and active diplomatic relations will flow once the Palestinian Authority meets reform commitments sought by the international community.They include recognition of Israel’s right to exist and commitments to hold democratic elections and enact significant reform to finance, governance and education.Governments recognising Palestine insist Hamas must have no role in any new state.“This is the world saying that what is going on in Gaza is completely unacceptable,” Albanese said.“You can’t have a circumstance where people have been denied essential food and water and medicines. You can’t have the number of civilian deaths that we’ve seen.”Netanyahu hit out at leaders recognising Palestine, including Albanese.“There will be no Palestinian state,” he said.“I have a clear message to those leaders who are recognising a Palestinian state after the horrendous 7 October massacre: You are rewarding terror with an enormous prize.“And I have another message for you: It’s not going to happen.”He said the Israeli government’s response would come after his return from the United States this week, telling world leaders: “Stand by.”The foreign minister,Penny Wong, responded to Netanyahu from New York, saying Australia was pressing for peace.“We’re working with others because we want to be part of the global momentum for peace,” she said.“That is where other countries are. That is what people are working for.”US President Donald Trump, who opposes recognition and has threatened retaliation against Canada already, will be an outsize presence in New York this week. Albanese is trying to secure his first face-to-face meeting with the president, even as a group of 25 of his close allies warned Australia’s recognition of Palestinecould spark “punitive measures”from the US.The group, including Trump loyalists Ted Cruz of Texas and Elise Stefanik of New York, wrote to Albanese, Starmer, Carney and French presidentEmmanuel Macronurging a rethink at the weekend.MapBut Israel’s government is increasingly isolated on the world stage, including over its latestmilitary offensive targeting Gaza City. The continued expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank has also angered international leaders.A United Nations independent international commission ofinquiry found last weekthat genocide is occurring in Gaza.Its report accused Netanyahu and other senior Israeli leaders of incitement of genocide. Israel’s foreign ministry categorically rejected the report’s finding and called for the commission’s abolition.There is no timeline yet for the international court of justice hearing into Israel’s compliance with an international convention on genocide, butobservers expect it is unlikely to occurbefore 2027.‘Direct evidence of genocidal intent’: the UN commission of inquiry’s report on Israel’s actions in GazaRead moreAlbanese has been a vocal proponent of Palestinian statehood for decades, and Labor’s national platform has called for recognition to be a priority for Australian governments.The White House moved to block senior Palestinian representatives from travelling to the UN this week for talks, denying members of the delegation visas.The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, said Labor had extended recognition of Palestine ahead of crucial conditions being in place.“Hamas still holds Israeli hostages, seized during the terrorist raids of 7 October 2023. Hamas is still in power in Gaza and continues to attack Israel. The Palestinian people can see no hope of democratic self-governance while Hamas is in power,” she said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyAnthony AlbaneseUnited NationsEmmanuel MacronKeir StarmerDonald TrumpPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Eurofighters took off from the Rostock-Laage airbase to head off the aircraft as it flew in international airspace.Tensions between Nato and Russia have been dramatically rising after a series of what European governments say are deliberate, provocative acts by the Kremlin. On Friday, three Russian MiG-31 fighters violated Estonian airspace in the Gulf of Finland. Moscow denies this.Zelenskyy accuses allies of ‘wasting time’ as he prepares for Trump meetingRead moreAsked if the US was willing to defend EU countries from further Russian aggression, Donald Trump on Sunday said: “Yeah, I would. I would.” Earlier, the US president said he “didn’t like” Russia’s jet incursion but said he had not been briefed about it.Estonia condemned the Kremlin’s “brazen” behaviour. It said it was convening an emergency security council meeting for the first time in 34 years of Estonia’s membership of the UN. World leaders are gathering this week in New York for the UN’s general assembly.Estonian foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, said the violation was “part of a broader pattern of escalation by Russia, both regionally and globally”. It included violations of Polish and Romanian airspace. “This behaviour requires an international response,” Tsahkna said.Tallinn – a staunch supporter of Ukraine – has requested consultations under Nato’s article four, which allows members to meet with allies if their security is threatened. Last week, Poland’s foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, said Moscow wastesting Nato’s reactions with “incremental” hostile steps, short of a full-scale conflict.His comments at a security conference in Kyiv came after 19 Russian drones landed on Polish territory. Over the weekend, a man who was out foraging for mushroomsdiscovered debris from a decoy dronein a forested area, about 1.5km from the village of Sulmice, in Zamość county.Late on Sunday the Russian defence ministry said a Ukrainian drone attack on a resort area in Crimea had killed two people and injured 15.According to Bloomberg, citing Kremlin sources, Vladimir Putin has concluded that the US is unlikely to do much to strengthen Ukraine’s defences after his August summit with Donald Trump in Alaska. Russia intends to step up its attacks to force Kyiv to capitulate, the agency reported.Reports suggest Washington is planning to reduce security assistance to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, which share a border with Russia.Estonia’s defence minister, Hanno Pevkur, said Russian actions were aimed at shifting the west’s focus away fromUkraine. “This is exactly what Russia wants – to divert our attention away from helping Ukraine and to focus on our own back yard. That’s the key goal,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

European governments did not want a wider war but had no choice but to respond, he said.Rinkėvičs added: “Russia is doing just enough to make it seem like it is not going too far. But, knowing both the logic of thinking in Russia and the frequent incompetence at various levels, this [a conflict] could happen.

According to the Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, western attempts to pressure Russia would not work or help efforts to end the war in Ukraine.Speaking on Fridaybefore his trip to the UN, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he was ready to hold talks with Putin or to meet him together with Trump.

The airport said Collins was “not yet able to deliver a new secure version of the check-in system”, and confirmed a cyber-attack had taken place.Airports urged passengers to check the status of their flights before travelling and asked them to arrive no earlier than three hours before long-haul flights and two hours before shorter journeys.Collins said on Saturday it was dealing with a “cyber-related incident”. The hack joins a long line of attacks that have hit big companies in recent months. The UK’s largest automotive employer, Jaguar Land Rover, has beenunable to produce any cars for three weeksbecause of a hack, while the British retailersMarks & Spencerand theCo-op were also hitby separate attacks earlier this year.Airlines were still able to check in passengers manually.AtHeathrow90% of more than 350 flights had been delayed by 15 minutes or more, while six were cancelled by 3pm on Sunday afternoon, according to the data company Flightradar24. The average delay was 34 minutes. Thirteen flights were cancelled on Saturday, although the vast majority of hundreds of flights were delayed.A Heathrow spokesperson said the “underlying problem was outside our influence” but added that the airport had brought in extra staff to help cope with any disruption. It is understood that Heathrow has not mandated any cancellations for Monday, and the majority of flights are expected to be operating.“Work continues to resolve and recover from Friday’s outage of a Collins Aerospace airline system that impacted check-in,” Heathrow said in a statement. “We apologise to those who have faced delays, but by working together with airlines, the vast majority of flights have continued to operate.”In Brussels 86% of flights by 3pm on Sunday had been delayed at the airport at Zaventem, one of two serving the Belgian capital. Delays ranged from 15 minutes to four hours.The airport said 15% of its scheduled flights would be cancelled overall this weekend. It cancelled 25 departures out of 234 on Saturday, and 50 out of 257 on Sunday “in order to avoid long queues and late cancellations”, a spokesperson said.In Berlin 73% of about 200 flights were delayed. “Due to a systems outage at a service provider, there are longer waiting times,” Berlin airport said on its website. “Please use online check-in, self-service check-in and the fast bag drop service.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The children were allegedly playing football in a prohibited area, “creating a disturbance to the public peace and a danger for people in transit”, according to the official notice given to the parents and published in the Italian press.Antonio Trampus, the father of one of the children, toldLa Stampa: “My son called me in tears. The police wouldn’t listen to reason. They could have called us parents and asked us to take our children home. Instead, they immediately took their names and addresses.”The fine could rise to as much as €500 if not paid within 60 days. “But we will not pay,” said Trampus, adding that the group was planning to appeal and take the matter up with the mayor of Venice, Luigi Brugnaro.The fines were enforced based on regulations introduced in 2019 banning ball games in certain areas of Venice. In Murano, the only square where the game is permitted is San Bernardo. But the parents argue that Pino Signoretto square was never included in the list of banned areas as it was only recently created after the neighbourhood was redeveloped.“San Bernardo is not suitable,” said Trampus. “Whereas the other square is. Removing the children there would mean returning it to the state it was in before.”The case sparked debate in Venice, with local councillor Marco Gasparinetti arguing that the police intervention was disproportionate and questioning the priorities in a citygrappling with overtourism, pickpockets and a dwindling local population.Referring to the parents being summoned to the police station, Gasparinetti wrote on Facebook: “Were they scammers? Pickpockets? Drug dealers? No, they were the parents of [14] children.”Gasparinetti added that it should have been enough to take the ball away and tell the children to stop playing. “Wouldn’t that have been more educational? Common sense and a sense of priority were lacking.”Corriere del Venetoreported that the children might have been penalised due to their age, because areas where ball games are permitted are exclusive to children under 11.Paolo Poggi, a retired professional footballer who was born in Venice, also contributed to the debate. “Long live children who spend time outdoors,” he toldLa Nuova Venezianewspaper. “The rules are sacrosanct, but common sense is needed. Children’s play experience must be preserved.”Explore more on these topicsItalyChildrenEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The idea of a 2% wealth tax on fortunes worth more than €100m has been proposed byGabriel Zucman, an economics professorwho has become a household name in France.The economist argues that the tax – named the Zucman tax by others – could help France with its squeezed budget. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, this month appointed a new prime minister,Sébastien Lecornu, after the centrist François Bayroufailed to win support for an austerity budget.Arnault –previously the world’s richest man– claimed that a 2% wealth tax would be an “offensive, which is deadly for our economy”. He also said he was “certainly the largest individual taxpayer and one of the largest professional taxpayers through the companies I run” in France.Arnault’s net worth stood at $169bn (£125bn) on Friday, mainly because of his 48% stake in LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, according to Bloomberg. After joining his family company and turning it from construction to property, Arnault grew his fortune by buying up brands ranging from the jewellers Bulgari and Tiffany & Co, the fashion houses ChristianDiorand Celine, to perfumes and whiskey brand Glenmorangie.Arnault, who lives in Paris, sparked a French national debate over tax in 2012when he sought Belgian citizenship. However, in April 2013, he withdrew his application as “a gesture of my attachment to France and my faith in its future”, according to Bloomberg.Zucman is a professor of economics at the Paris School of Economics and the École normale supérieure, and last yearwrote a prominent studyon the wealth tax for the G20. In June,Zucman wrote in the Guardian: “Unprecedented wealth concentration – and the unbridled power that comes with such wealth – has distorted our democracy and is driving societal and economic tensions.”The wealth tax could raise as much as €20bn, according to Zucman. However, other economists have argued that it would raise only €5bn if the ultra-wealthy leaveFrance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are no obvious signs for it beyond a little note next to the intercom. When buzzed this week, no one appeared at the door.This is the registered office of Hunnewell Partners, which describes itself as an “entrepreneurial private equity and litigation funding practice”.The company is also the ultimate owner of Imedi TV, a broadcaster described by the disinformation monitoring arm of the EU’s foreign affairs service as the “propaganda megaphone undermining Georgia’s EU aspirations”, or the “ruling party’s most powerful propaganda machine, relentlessly pushing anti-western rhetoric and echoing Kremlin-style disinformation”.Hunnewell Partners said Imedi TV, Georgia’s most popular broadcaster, was a small part of its holdings and that it had editorial independence. Imedi TV accused the EU’s disinformation body of factual inaccuracies and misunderstanding the channel’s editorial line. It denies being pro-Russian and anti-western.There are strong and opposing views on both sides, but there can be little doubt that Georgia’s future is in the balance, and this London company is part of the debate.The country seceded from the USSR in 1991 and there is a constitutional obligation on its governments to seek accession to the EU, but in recent years its politics has been transformed.The governing party, Georgian Dream, led byits honorary chair, Bidzina Ivanishvili, the richest man in the country, has been accused by western governments, the EU and civil society groups of moving Georgia back into Russia’s sphere of influence and corrupting its democratic institutions.A series of opposition leaders have been imprisoned in recent weeks and months.View image in fullscreenBidzina Ivanishvili, the founder and leader of the Georgian Dream party.Photograph: David Mdzinarishvili/EPAIn October, Georgia will hold important municipal elections. Last week, the UK and 36 other countries raised concerns about the lack of an invitation into the country for election monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) at a time of growing“repression” of civil societyand independent journalists.At a crucial moment in Georgia’s history, Imedi TV is said to be a malign player, helping to prop up what NGOs and western governments – including the US, which has imposed sanctions on Ivanishvili –claim is an increasingly authoritarian regime.It seems the UK government’s public shows of concern have not gone unnoticed in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital. This week alone, the broadcaster’s cameras “accidentally” filmed what the channel described as evidence of a “secret meeting” between two “radical opposition representatives” as they left the British embassy.In August, Imedi reported on claims from Archil Gorduladze, the chair of the Georgian parliament’s legal affairs committee, that the British embassy had attempted to fund individuals connected to the opposition United National Movement party (UNM).Last December, the Georgian parliament passed a “family values and the protection of minors” law that provides a legal basis for authorities to outlaw Pride events and public displays of the LGBTQ+ rainbow flag, and to impose censorship of films and books.Before that, Imedi and other government-supporting media outlets “amplified stories with limited relevance to Georgia’s context, such as the marriage of UK armed forces minister Luke Pollard to his male partner”, according to a report by the Media Development Foundation, an NGO, entitled Sexist Hate Speech and Homophobia.“Identical texts were shared across various government-aligned Facebook pages, featuring a wedding photo of the politician, accompanied by the caption: ‘British MP got married’ and the quote: ‘I’m a happy man because I get to call him my husband,’” the report said.A spokesperson for Imedi TV said: “Although Imedi TV respects and often reflects the cultural conservatism of its viewers, it rejects any accusation of homophobia. The channel believes in individuals’ right to choose their own lifestyle.“Imedi reported that the British embassy in Georgia attempted to fund media outlets and NGOs associated with opposition party leaders. That is a perfectly valid story to report. There was also information circulating about the embassy financing their trainings; we raised questions about this, but the British embassy left our inquiries unanswered.”On the recent report from the embassy, the spokesperson said: “A meeting between any politician and an ambassador is important, especially when it comes to an opposition politician who is often supported by some ambassadors through their statements. If Nigel Farage was caught having an undeclared meeting with the US embassy in London to discuss the flag march, that would be all over the news.”Imedi TV claims that while it is opposed to UNM taking back power, it also holds Georgian Dream to account.It is against this background that a cross-party group of MPs in the UK, including Blair McDougall, a Labour MP who was recently made a minister, have been asking for the government to act.James MacCleary, a Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, said: “Under Hunnewell’s control, Imedi TV has become a propaganda arm of the Georgian Dream government, parroting pro-Russian lines and attacking the democratic opposition. That is why I have pushed the government for months to bring sanctions against Bidzina Ivanishvili and his cronies, including Irakli Rukhadze [a co-founder of Hunnewell Partners].”View image in fullscreenThe registered office of Hunnewell Partners, above a wine shop in Belgravia, London.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianHunnewell Partners has a controversial history and one that has been chronicled through the UK’s high court, court of appeal and supreme court. In February 2008, the previous owner of Imedi TV, the Georgian businessmanArkadi Patarkatsishvili, known as Badri, died of a heart attack. He was said to be worth £6bn but his wealth was hidden around the world.A company called Salford Capital Partners sought to recover the funds for the grieving family, a process made more difficult by the emergence of a secret second wife in Moscow.Apart from the chief executive of Salford Capital Partners, Eugene Jaffe, three other key individuals involved in the recovery were Rukhadze, a US citizen, Igor Alexeev, a Russian who also holds US citizenship, and a British solicitor, Ben Marson.There was a falling-out with Jaffe. Rukhadze, Alexeev and Marson split off, offering Badri’s family their services “after learning much of the very complex information about the location and nature of Badri’s assets”, according to a supreme court summary of the case.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The court of appeal rejected its appeal and in March the supreme court dismissed an attempt to revise the duties and liabilities of fiduciaries.In her original high court judgment in 2018, Mrs Justice Cockerill said she “formed the view that I have to treat the evidence of Mr Jaffe, Mr Rukhadze and to a slightly lesser extent Mr Alexeev and Mr Marson with considerable caution, because for these reasons even to the extent that the witnesses were honestly trying to assist I could not be confident that I was receiving accurate factual evidence”.She described Rukhadze, who is also chair of Imedi’s supervisory board, and described by Hunnewell as “actively involved in all strategic decisions”, as an “unusually focused man with a strong sense of self-belief”.“I received the impression that he would not be overly concerned about lying in what he considered a good cause,” she said, “and indeed, in some respects I have concluded that his evidence was not truthful but constructed (sometimes on the hoof and inconsistently with the case put by his legal team) on the basis that he perceived that this would be most helpful to his case.”Of Marson, who recently changed his name to Marson-Knight, the judge said his demeanour suggested he was “trying to assist the court” but “at points it appeared to me that he had persuaded himself of a position which was not, looked at objectively, credible”.She went on: “At others I was regretfully persuaded that despite his professional status he was prepared to be less than candid during his evidence. I also note that his casual approach to the erroneous use of statements of truth on the defences indicated that his conduct fell below the levels that one would expect for a qualified solicitor.”Marsons’s claims in court in relation to the status of his employment before the founding of Hunnewell Partners was described as “little short of incredible and drives a conclusion that his evidence in this respect was not honest”.A spokesperson for Hunnewell said: “Your extracts above are very narrow quotes from hundreds of pages of findings and seek to unfairly paint the Hunnewell Partners in a negative light.”Badri’s family transferred Imedi TV to Hunnewell Partners 2021 and in March this year a young British journalist, Will Neal, had an article published in the Byline Times examining the company’s ownership and past client list.Imedi TV and other pro-government channels subsequently aired claims that suggested Neal was part of the “deep state”, apparently on the basis that he had been given a grant from the Civil Society Foundation, a Georgian NGO that was formerly part of the Open Society group, founded by the the financier George Soros.View image in fullscreenImedi TV coverage of Will Neal’s reporting.Photograph: imedi.geAfter leaving the country for personal and business meetings, Neal was blocked at the border as he sought to return. He is appealing against the decision but has as yet not been given a reason for this treatment. There is no suggestion that Hunnewell Partners played a role.“I know for a fact that the issue was raised by the UK ambassador with the Georgian foreign minister, but I don’t know that any … sort of reason was given diplomatically behind the scenes,” he said.A spokesperson for Hunnewell Partners said: “Hunnewell Partners had no involvement whatsoever in Georgia’s decision to deny Will Neal entry into Georgia. This action also occurred without our prior knowledge. The first we learned of the incident was through media reporting.“We have neither the desire nor the power to inconvenience a journalist in that way. Nor does any of Hunnewell’s affiliates. We actively support and promote the principle of a free and independent press in every jurisdiction, and are perfectly happy to accept scrutiny that is unbiased and based on the facts.”Georgia’s foreign affairs ministry did not respond to a request for comment.The British government has enacted sanctions against some Georgian politicians, businessmen and officials, including the country’s general prosecutor, but civil society groups and opposition figures want more.The UK’s position as a safe haven for wealthy people is said by opposition figures to give it greater leverage over the Georgian government, including Ivanishvili, who the Pandora Papers leak in 2021 showed had registered12 companies in the British Virgin Islandsbetween 1998 and 2016.Hunnewell Partners is a co-investor with a private equity fund founded by Ivanishvili in a Georgian cement company. Rukhadze has already been put under sanctions by Ukraine and Lithuania.A Hunnewell spokesperson said: “These measures are not based on any proper assessment of the facts and stem from a smear campaign launched by figures in the Georgian opposition and the previous president Mikheil Saakashvili, who seized Imedi TV and put it under state control during his reign.“They are targeting Irakli Rukhadze in an attempt to suppress the most popular TV station in Georgia because it opposes their return to power.”Of the business link, the spokesperson added: “There’s an indirect business relationship with Ivanishvili via one investment, the cement company. Nothing very unusual, given [Ivanishvili’s] prominence in Georgian business.”He added that Hunnewell’s directors had taken precautions to not violate sanctions imposed on Russia with Rukhadze having resigned from the board of Rissa, a Russian bottled water company where he’d been a director for 20 years.For some, the case of Hunnewell Partners is a test as to the British government’s resolve over Georgia’s future as a democracy. Sandro Kevkhishvili, the anti-corruption programme manager at Transparency International Georgia, said: “Rukhadze is not formally a member of Georgian Dream but he is, as he says, a supporter. It is a political actor. So what is the British government’s position on this? That is the question. And using a sanctions mechanism of some kind is definitely one way of dealing with it.”Giorgi Kandelaki, a former member of parliament and now a researcher at the Soviet Past Research Laboratory, said Georgia’s transformation mattered.“What is unfolding in Georgia is not just another instance of democratic backsliding in a distant country,” he said. “Georgia’s trajectory carries a profound geopolitical weight: a nation once counted among the west’s most committed allies is now being taken over by the enemies of freedom.”Explore more on these topicsGeorgiaEuropePress freedomnewsShareReuse this content"

Lebanon’s president, Joseph Aoun, denounced the strike, which he said violated the ceasefire betweenIsraeland Hezbollah.Despite the signing of a ceasefire last November, Israel has carried out near-daily strikes on Lebanon, more than 4,500 in total, according to the Lebanese army.

Every week, new restrictions are imposed,” said the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (Ocha).Australia, Canada and the UKannounced the formal recognition of a Palestinian statehoodon Sunday, which the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, said was meant to “revive thehope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis”. More states are expected to follow, in what is widely seen as an expression of disapproval of Israel’s conduct in Gaza.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reacted to the announcements with anger, accusing the western countries of giving an “absurd prize for terrorism”.Western countries and much of the international community have called on Israel to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and called for a halt to the Gaza City campaign.The invasion of Gaza City is also unpopular in Israel, with tens of thousands of people protesting on Saturday night, calling for an end to the war and for the government to make a deal to rescue the remaining hostages.Israeli strikes have killed more than 65,000 people in Gaza over the last 23 months and destroyed most of the Palestinian territory. Israel launched the war in response to the 7 October attack by Hamas-led militants that killed about 1,200 people.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesLebanonnewsShareReuse this content"

All remaining Israeli hostages must be released, Starmer added.Downing Street believes that recognition will help to counter some of the criticism it has faced at home, including from in the cabinet and among Labour MPs, over its response to the Gaza crisis, ahead of what is expected to be a politically fraught annual conference.In a video message to the nation, Starmer said: “The hope of a two-state solution is fading but we cannot let that light go out … Today, to revive the hope of peace and a two-state solution, I state clearly, as prime minister of this great country, that the UK formally recognises the state of Palestine.“In the face of the growing horrors in the Middle East we are acting to keep alive the possibility of peace and a two-state solution. That means a safe and secure Israel, alongside a viable Palestinian state. At the moment we have neither.”In an attempt to deal with criticisms of the announcement from the US and Israel, he said: “Let’s be frank, Hamas is a brutal terror organisation. Our call for a genuine two-state solution is the exact opposite of their hateful vision. So we are clear, this solution is not a reward for Hamas, because it means Hamas can have no future, no role in government, no role in security.”But he concluded: “The man-made humanitarian crisis in Gaza reaches new depths. The Israeli government’s relentless and increasing bombardment of Gaza, the offensive of recent weeks, the starvation and devastation are utterly intolerable. Tens of thousands have been killed, including thousands as they tried to collect food and water. This death and destruction horrifies all of us. It must end.”The UK is to recognise a Palestinian state based provisionally on 1967 borders, before Israel occupied the Gaza Strip andWest Bank. It will also pave the way for full diplomatic relations, with the Palestinian head of mission, Husam Zomlot, likely to be upgraded to full ambassadorial status.Zomlot said: “It marks an irreversible step towards justice, peace and the correction of historic wrongs, including Britain’s colonial legacy, the Balfour Declaration and its role in the dispossession of the Palestinian people.”Starmer first announced in July that the UK would recognise Palestine by the time of the UN general assembly, which begins next week, unless Israel abided by a ceasefire and committed to a two-state solution. The prime minister spoke to Netanyahu before the announcement.More than 150 countries, including France, which has led the western response, are expected to have recognised Palestine by the end of next week, although some may set conditions. The United States, now in effect opposed to a two-state solution, has rejected the UK move.Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said: “Further steps, including the establishment of diplomatic relations and the opening of embassies will be considered as the Palestinian Authority makes further progress on commitments to reform.”MapThe Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, said: “Recognising the state of Palestine, led by the Palestinian Authority, empowers those who seek peaceful coexistence and the end of Hamas. This in no way legitimises terrorism, nor is it any reward for it.”The move comes seven decades after the end of the British mandate in Palestine and the formation of the state of Israel, as the death toll from the war on Gaza continues to rise and conditions for the people trapped there become even more desperate.While the announcement is not being portrayed as a punishment of Israel, it is unlikely the step would have been taken if Netanyahu had conducted the military campaign in Gaza with less ferocity and greater regard for international law.Israel’s foreign ministry said it rejected what it called the “one-sided” recognition of a Palestinian state by Britain, Canada and Australia, warning that recognition could further destabilise the region.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No, it won’t, that’s down to humanitarian aid. Will this free hostages? That must be down to a ceasefire,” he told the BBC. “What do we say to the children of a future Palestinian state? Do we say we have to wait for the perfect conditions before we can recognise a Palestinian state?”Starmer had come under pressure from Labour MPs, including about third of his cabinet, to recognise Palestine, because of the moral imperative but also amid concerns that the party would lose votes to the left and pro-Gaza independents over the issue.One cabinet minister told the Guardian: “Symbols matter. The Labour government has placed itself on the right side of history. Everyone knows that recognition alone won’t change the lives of Palestinians, but it is a timely and necessary riposte to an authoritarian Israeli government that has increasingly made Israel a pariah state.“There now needs to be a serious effort to kickstart a peace process and change facts on the ground – or at least to prevent Israel from killing the two-state solution with further West Bank annexations.”Why Britain recognising Palestine matters – podcastRead more‘Not enough in itself’: wary welcome in West Bank over recognition of PalestineRead moreExplore more on these topicsUK newsPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warKeir StarmerWest BanknewsShareReuse this content"

Don’t let Jihadist ideology dictate your policy,” the post read.Israeli officials have been making this argument in recent weeks as they sought to head off the growing momentum in the UK, France, Canada, Portugal and others towards recognition.Yaakov Amidror, a former national security adviser to Netanyahu, said Hamas could now say to the Palestinians that without its 2023 attack, which killed about 1,200, the recognition of Palestine by the UK and others would not have happened.“It will be understood as a reward to them, and Starmer has lost any leverage that he had … and [a Palestinian state] is not going to happen anyway,” said Amidror, an analyst at the conservative Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security and the Jewish Institute for National Security of America in Washington.“Israel is determined to destroy the terrorist organisation that is called Hamas. Some of our friends around the world have decided that Hamas should survive and Israel should leave the Gaza Strip, taking our hostages … There is a gap here that cannot be bridged with nice words.”Netanyahu’s ‘super-Sparta’ vision braces Israel for isolated economic futureRead moreBut successive opinion polls in Israel have shown strong demand for a negotiated end to the conflict in Gaza.

Analysts in Israel suggest that Netanyahu will make a decision only after his forthcoming trip to Washington at the end of the month.Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, called for wholesale annexation of the occupied West Bank.“The days when Britain and other countries would determine our future are over … The only response to this anti-Israeli move is sovereignty over the historic homeland of the Jewish people in Judea and Samaria, and permanently removing the folly of a Palestinian state from the agenda,” Smotrich said on X.Explore more on these topicsIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warThe far rightHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

Theannouncementfollowed mounting pressure on Keir Starmer from within the Labour party and beyond.1.How will the decision be met within the Labour party?TheHamas attackson Israel on 7 October 2023 were met with horror across the British political spectrum. Yet soon after, concern began to mount around the scale of Israel’s response. As the death toll rose, and the situation on the ground in Gaza worsened, internal pressure on Starmer increased.The government had disappointed many on its own side by saying recognition would happen only as part of a negotiated peace deal. By July this year, more than 100 Labour MPs had signed a cross-party letter, led by the Rotherham MP Sarah Champion, calling for the government to formally acknowledge Palestine immediately.As global outcry grew, the Guardian revealed that cabinet ministers were alsoprivately urging the prime minister to act. They included his then deputy, Angela Rayner, and the now foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, told MPs he wanted recognition “while there’s still a state of Palestine left to recognise”.Starmer’s announcement will be met with widespread relief inside the Labour party. Recognition of a Palestinian state has long been a Labour manifesto promise. There is a widely held view that while largely symbolic, it is important to do. That said, there are more than a handful of Labour MPs on the right of the party who will be concerned that it could damage relations with key strategic allies, notably the US, without changing anything on the ground in Gaza.But as well as the moral imperative to act, the government also had a political one. Labour lost four seats at last year’s general election to pro-Palestinian candidates amid dissatisfaction over the party’s stance on Gaza – and the issue was cited as one of the main reasons why voters were abandoning the party for the Greens and leftwing independents.2.Will it be enough for the left?Probably not. While recognition was considered essential by many Labour MPs, it was also seen as just one step. Both within the party and without, there are demands for the government to go even further – on sanctions, arms, trade and war crimes.UK, Canada and Australia announce formal recognition of Palestine, with wave of Israel’s allies to followRead moreGovernment advisers are defensive, citing what the UK has already done to hold Israel to account since Labour came to power. They point to the UKrestoring fundingto the UN agency Unrwa,sanctioning far-right Israeli ministersandthose who committedsettler violence,breaking off trade negotiationswith Israel, backing thelegitimacy of the international criminal court,restricting arms licencesto Israel (though not preventing them entirely) andstepping up humanitarian aidto Gaza.Starmer’s failure to – publicly at least – condemn Israel’s latest ground offensive while standing alongside Donald Trump at Chequers left many wondering whether he had even privately urged the US president to use his power over the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to bring an end to the conflict, or to put his full political might behind ceasefire talks.Political movements to the left of Labour welcomed Palestinian self-determination, but want the government to do more.Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader who is now forming his own leftwing political movement, said: “Next, the UK should recognise the genocide in Gaza, end its complicity in crimes against humanity, and stop arming Israel.”The new Green party leader, Zack Polanski, said on X: “There won’t be a Palestinian state left if government’s continue enabling Israel’s unfolding genocide. Labour can’t credibly support Palestinian statehood whilst also continuing to arm Israel.”3.Will it help secure Starmer’s position?Downing Street insiders hope that Starmer’s move will help keep the wolves inside the Labour party at bay. The prime minister was under intense pressure from at least 100 Labour MPs and around a third of his cabinet to recognise the Palestinian state.Primarily, because they felt the situation on the ground in Gaza was so desperate. But also because it was urgent politically, after Labour lost four seats to pro-Gaza independents at the general election, with the threat of more to come, including, potentially, cabinet ministers Wes Streeting and Shabana Mahmood.It also helps take the heat out of the issue before the party’s conference in Liverpool next week, although Labour members and MPs would like to see the government go further by ceasing all arms trade with Israel and withdrawing military cooperation.While recognition on its own will by no means solve Starmer’s problems, and may create more tension on the international stage with Donald Trump opposing the move, it will at least prove to some of his internal critics that he is willing to listen to their concerns – and more than that, to act.4.What about the wider UK?Thousands of people across the UK have taken part in pro-Palestine marches since the start of the conflict, calling for recognition and an immediate ceasefire – suggesting there is widespread unease around the country over the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza. In the social media age, videos of the horrors on the ground have circulated widely.The marches have taken on an added complexity since the governmentproscribed Palestine Actionas a terrorist organisation despite concerns that the move could risk criminalising legitimate protest.Starmer’s decision to formally acknowledge Palestine will be a popular one. Pollsters YouGov found that public support for the move continued to significantly outweigh opposition, with44% backing it, while only 18% disagreed – with 37% unsure. The same polling found that 38% sympathised more with the Palestinian side, 12% with Israel, 17% with both sides equally – and 32% didn’t know.Labour insiders hope this could further solidify Starmer’s reputation for performing well on the international stage – despite the high stakes involved – although the domestic picture is far bleaker for the prime minister.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsPalestinian territoriesGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaLabournewsShareReuse this content"

It is a weekend and though the narrow streets of al-Am’ari camp are hot and quiet, his shop is crowded.Everyone inal-Am’ari, on the outskirts of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, knows that the UK, France, Portugal and Canada have said they willrecognise a Palestinian stateimminently, following formal recognition of Palestine by more than 140 other countries.“It is perfect. Even if it is very late coming, it means they have recognised the rights of the Palestinian people,” said Abu Said, who did not give his full name for fear of harassment or detention by Israel’s security forces.But although there is universal welcome for the move, there are significant reservations, too.Abu Said said: “It is not enough to recognise in itself. We need actions and implementation. The Palestinian people have suffered a lot and many promises were made and broken over 77 years.”View image in fullscreenAbu Said: ‘It is perfect. Even if it is very late coming, it means they have recognised the rights of the Palestinian people.’Photograph: Jason Burke/The GuardianAt the nearby Che Guevara Cafe, Mohamed Rizk, a librarian, said he was angered by the British decision, to be formally announced on Sunday, which he described as “symbolic only”.“What are the borders of the state they are recognising? Does anyone know? Has anyone said? It is only to pacify us,” he said. “At the end of the day, the US will veto anything anyway.”The walls of the cafe are decorated with images of iconic Palestinian figures such as Yasser Arafat, who led the Palestine Liberation Organisation for decades and co-founded Fatah, now the ruling party of the Palestinian Authority, which is based in Ramallah and exercises part authority over some of the occupiedWest Bank.On another wall are pictures of Palestinian refugees from the period of the wars surrounding the foundation of Israel in 1948. Many of the original inhabitants of al-Am’ari camp were expelled from the central city of Lydda, or Lod, lived under Jordanian authority until the war of 1967, and then under Israeli military occupation.The camp, now a maze of concrete tenements, is a bastion of support for Fatah. Walls have been painted with graffiti to welcome prisoners home from Israeli jails during the two ceasefires in the current Gaza conflict. Many residents were critical of the Hamas raid into Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to 250 hostages being taken to Gaza. The ensuing Israeli offensive has so far killed more than 65,000 people, mostly civilians, and devastated the territory.On a third wall was a big screen showing images of the aftermath of the latest Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City, broadcast by Al Jazeera.“Are Britain and France and the others going to impose arms embargos? Get food to Gaza? Start treating Netanyahu like they treat Putin?” Rizk said.View image in fullscreenThe Che Guevara Café, with images of  refugees during the 1948 war and its aftermath on the wall.Photograph: Jason Burke/The GuardianNearby, Umm Karim, a 40-year-old lab technician, was parking her car on a potholed sidestreet. She too withheld her full name, and said the British declaration was “not enough”.“We need practical measures, like breaking off diplomatic relations, lots of sanctions or at least prosecution of any British citizens who fight in the Israeli army,” she said.In July, David Lammy, the then British foreign secretary, told the UN that the UK bore a special burden of responsibility to support the two-state solution given its history in the region: specifically, the Balfour declaration of 1917 favouring the establishment of a homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine.“Our support for Israel, its right to exist and the security of its people is steadfast. However, the Balfour declaration came with the solemn promise ‘that nothing shall be done, nothing which may prejudice the civil and religious rights’ of the Palestinian people as well … This has not been upheld and it is a historical injustice which continues to unfold,”Lammy said.Nour Odeh, an analyst and journalist from Ramallah, said Britain’s historical role should never be ignored or overlooked.“This is a debt, and it’s never too late to do the right thing. But now to just give themselves a pat on the back and move on would be cynical and counterproductive. Recognition is a political and legal act and a commitment,” she said.One reason given for Britain’s decision is the plan to accelerate Israeli settlements in theWest Bank, which ministers fear will end any hope of a two-state solution. The French move is part of a broader diplomatic initiative.Benjamin Netanyahu has accused France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, of fuelling antisemitism and rewarding Hamas by recognising Palestine. “It is not diplomacy; it is appeasement. It rewards Hamas terror, hardens Hamas’s refusal to free the hostages,”the Israeli prime minister said.Many Israelis and Palestinians point to the example of South Africa, where the apartheid regime was dismantled in part as a result of international censure and sanctions. “South Africa did not have a change of heart. They were compelled to make very realistic decisions to survive,” said Odeh.Diana Buttu, a Palestinian analyst and former peace negotiator based in Haifa, said the new recognitions of Palestine meant both “potential and fear”.“Now there is an opportunity to use this to push for an end to occupation … The fear is that it is a way of evading responsibility,” Buttu said.“[In which case], it would distract from Gaza and do nothing for the West Bank, where it is getting worse and worse on the ground, and there will be repercussions for the Palestinians. The tools are all there. There is just no political will.”In al-Am’ari, Abu Said listed the multiple efforts to resolve the conflict by diplomacy and by force during his lifetime. He compared the recent history of the Palestinians to his own 40 years as a barber.“The customers come and go, the fashions change, everyone has a different idea of what to do, but at the end of the day I am still standing in my shop and nothing is very different.”Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesWest BankMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

He added: “We are bewildered as to why any of this happened and are very happy that this ordeal is over.”Barbie said: “They told us nothing. Even when we were taken to Kabul airport we thought maybe we were just flying somewhere for medical treatment.” Instead, they were put on flight to Doha, the capital ofQatar, whose officials had led negotiations for their release.Barbie said the toughest part of the past eight months had been “seeing my 80-year-old husband struggling to get into the back of a police truck with his hands and ankles chained”.The pair, who ran a charitable training programme that had been approved by theTaliban, were arrested on 1 February with their interpreter, Juya, and an American friend, Faye Hall.The arrest came when they were returning to their home in Bamyan province, central Afghanistan. Hall was released in March after negotiations that were also led by Qatari officials.The fate of Juya is unknown. As well as interpreting for the couple, he also helped care for Peter Reynolds, who requires regular heart medication, during his detention.He was prevented from interpreting for the couple during court proceedings, to the concern of their family. In March, their daughter Sarah Entwistle, who also campaigned for Juya’s release,told the Guardian: “Mum is obviously extremely concerned that without a competent interpreter, their case cannot be accurately or fairly represented and [they] will not be able to properly follow or engage in the proceedings, in serious breach of their rights.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their son, Jonathan Reynolds,told the BBCthat he was “ecstatic and massively grateful” to those who had been involved in securing their release.In a joint statement on Friday, their four children said: “This experience has reminded us of the power of diplomacy, empathy and international cooperation.”Peter and Barbie Reynolds were first held in a maximum security facility, “then in underground cells, without daylight, before being transferred” to the intelligence services in Kabul, UN experts have said.The couple married in a newly opened church in Kabul in 1970 and spent almost two decades living in Afghanistan, running educational programmes for women and children. When the Taliban returned to power in 2021, the couple remained in Afghanistan against the advice of the British embassy.Despite their ordeal, Barbie said they hoped to return. She said: “We are looking forward to returning to Afghanistan if we can. We are Afghan citizens.”Their son said: “They have not just a heart for the people of Afghanistan, but they have strategy as well, and the work they’ve been doing has been very fruitful and has a massively positive impact.”On Friday, the Taliban foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Qahar Balkhi said the couple “had violated the laws of Afghanistan” and were released from custody “following the judicial process”.Explore more on these topicsUK newsAfghanistanTalibanSouth and central AsiaQatarnewsShareReuse this content"

She said: “I’ve struggled with fake news for one year now about all my crimes. No evidence has been produced. So now fake documentation. And I guess the next step is fake evidence.”Siddiq and 20 other individuals, including her aunt, her mother, her brother and her sister, have been on trial in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, since the start of August. She is accused of influencing her aunt, Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted as Bangladesh’s prime minister last year,to secure a plot of landin a suburb of Dhaka for her family members.She denies the allegations, which she says are politically motivated.Keir Starmer’s independent adviser on the ministerial code cleared her in January after a series of allegations emerged from Bangladesh, but he had added that it was “regrettable that she was not more alert to the potential reputational risks” that arose from her familial ties and her Treasury role.Sheresignedfrom her roles as economic secretary to the treasury and city minister, claiming the allegations from Bangladesh were proving a distraction for the government.The identity documents published last week were said by the newspapers to contradict Siddiq’s previous claims that she had never had a national ID card and that a Bangladeshi passport in her name had expired around two and half decades ago.Siddiq said that she stood by these declarations and that her concern now was that the allegedly forged documents could be the start of more “fake news” from Dhaka, adding that she had never denied being a Bangladeshi citizen as well as a British national, and that she had informed the Treasury of this on becoming a minister.The Guardian has seen her declaration to the Treasury proving this to be the case.Siddiq, who was born in London, has Bangladeshi citizenship due to both parents being born there. She said she also had a Bangladesh passport as a child but that it expired when she was about 18 years old and it was not renewed.She said she did not understand why the allegedly fake documents had been produced, but that it filled her with concern about what was to come, adding: “One thing they could be doing is that they’re fabricating these things to see how well it lands, because then they’re going to fabricate evidence, maybe just to see how much the British press swallow it. It could be something like that.”It was claimed that records show that a passport for Siddiq was issued in London in September 2001, when Siddiq was 19, and a national identity card issued in January 2011.It was further claimed that she applied to renew her passport in January 2011 at the Agargaon passport office in Dhaka and that she has a voter registration number.Siddiq said that none of the claims were true.A broadcast interview in 2017 has also been cited as evidence that Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Highgate, has not been honest about her citizenship.She had been asked by Channel 4 whether she would intervene in the case of Ahmad bin Quasem, a Bangladeshi lawyer trained in the UK who had allegedly been abducted inBangladesh.She responded: “Are you aware I am a British MP? I was born in London. Are you implying that I am a Bangladeshi politician? Because I don’t think that’s the right thing to imply.“Are you calling me Bangladeshi? Because I am British, be very careful what you’re saying because I’m a British MP from Hampstead and Kilburn.”Siddiq said that the conversation had been taken out of context by those seeking to traduce her. She said: “I basically said: ‘Sorry, I’m not Bangladeshi. I’m British, meaning, I’m not a Bangladeshi MP, I’m not taking on casework from a Bangladeshi.’ There’s nothing about citizenship.”Siddiq added that she had beenprevented from having legal representation at the trial in Dhakaand that the authorities had still not contacted her.The anti-corruption commission prosecuting Siddiq has claimed that a summons was sent to an address listed on Siddiq’s Bangladesh passport, national identity card and in the voter roll.Siddiq said she had never lived at the address said to be contained on what she described as “fake documents”.The anti-corruption commission and the Times have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsBangladeshSheikh HasinaSouth and central AsiaLabournewsShareReuse this content"

I am engaged in ongoing discussions with Jeremy, for whom, like all socialists of my generation, I have nothing but respect.”On Friday, Sultana said she had instructed “specialist defamation lawyers” after she was “the subject of a number of false and defamatory statements” about her launch of a paid membership system.It came after a message encouraging supporters of the outfit to sign up was disowned as an “unauthorised email” by Corbyn.Sultana said she had taken the step because she had been “sidelined” and “effectively frozen out” by the former Labour leader and fellow independent MPs Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain, Iqbal Mohamed and Shockat Adam.The MP added: “Unfortunately I have been subjected to what can only be described as a sexist boys’ club: I have been treated appallingly and excluded completely.”Corbyn had previously urged people not to use the “supposed membership portal” and said legal advice was being taken over its launch.The row is the latest in a series of disagreements between the two MPs over the direction of the party, which is yet to hold an annual conference or decide on an official name.Sultana announced its launch in July before Corbyn appeared ready to confirm it.But the party appeared to be building momentum, with Sultana claiming more than 750,000 supporters had signed up.Sultana, who was suspended last year alongside six other Labour MPs for voting to scrap the two-child benefit cap, announced in July she was quitting Labour to set up a new political party.Explore more on these topicsZarah SultanaJeremy CorbynnewsShareReuse this content"

The government is planning to set out its belief that the expansion will be possible without breaching the UK’s carbon budget.A government source said: “The transport secretary has cleared Gatwick expansion for take-off. With capacity constraints holding back business, trade and tourism, this is a no-brainer for growth.“This government has taken unprecedented steps to get this done, navigating a needlessly complex planning system, which our reforms will simplify in future.“It is possible that planes could be taking off from a new full runway at Gatwick before the next general election.“Any airport expansion must be delivered in line with our legally binding climate change commitments and meet strict environmental requirements.”The shadow transport secretary, Richard Holden, welcomed the decision to approve Gatwick’s second runway.He said: “If done with sensible mitigations, it will be a vital step towards driving economic growth, improving connectivity, and strengthening Britain’s position on the global stage. But let’s be clear, this decision should have been made months ago.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Green party leader said: “It ignores basic climate science and risks undermining efforts to tackle the climate crisis.“Labour keeps wheeling out the same nonsense about growth, but at what cost? What this really means is more pollution, more noise for local communities, and no real economic benefit.”Local campaigners opposed to expansion are concerned about the impact on surface transport, noise, housing provision and wastewater treatment, but the airport insists it has conducted “full and thorough assessments” of those issues.Cagne, an umbrella aviation community and environment group for Sussex, Surrey and Kent, said it stood ready to serve a judicial review funded by residents and environmental bodies.The group said: “We know this government cares little for the environmental impact aviation is having on our planet and Gatwick’s neighbours, but not to demand that Gatwick pays for the infrastructure, the onsite wastewater treatment plant, and noise impact is unlawful in our book.”The Stay Grounded campaign said the approval “prioritises the profit of a few at the expense of us all”.Friends of the Earth’s head of campaigns, Rosie Downes, said: “With emissions from aviation rising as climate extremes increasingly batter the planet with more intense floods, droughts and wildfires, it’s a struggle to see how the government can conclude expansion at Gatwick is a wise move.”In July,Heathrow submitted plans for a third runwayas part of a £50bn investment, with the government insisting that expanding Europe’s largest airport could create 100,000 jobs and drive growth.The two-mile (3.2km) runway expansion would cross a diverted M25 and allow more than 750 additional flights a day over London, helping bring the total annual number of passengers to 150 million.Explore more on these topicsGatwick airportAir transportBusiness travelTransportHeidi AlexanderLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Davey boycotted last week’s state dinner with Donald Trump over the lack of US efforts to push Israel to seek peace.The Lib Dems were also notably more vehement than Labour in condemning the language seen at last weekend’sfar-right marchin London.Speaking to reporters after her speech, Cooper said she opposed the recent spate of hanging flags from lamp-posts and other street furniture: “If you want to display your patriotism, you can put a flag up in your house, in your window. Putting it on public property can send a different kind of message.”Explore more on these topicsLiberal Democrat conferenceLiberal DemocratsEd DaveynewsShareReuse this content"

She disappeared after a night out, and her body was found two months later in the grounds of a hotel where she was last seen drinking with British soldiers.View image in fullscreenRose Wanyua Wanjiku, elder sister of Agnes Wanjiru, holds a photograph of Agnes, who died in 2012.Photograph: Brian Inganga/APWanjiru’s death has already been the focus of several inquests and criminal inquiries, but the latest charges are the first time a suspect has been formally identified in the case.The charge comes after a fresh police investigation, led by detectives in Kenya, which retains jurisdiction in the case. It followed an investigation in 2021 by the Sunday Times newspaper , in which several current and former soldiers in the regiment came forward to name a suspect.Following Tuesday’s court hearing, Purkiss’s name has been circulated widely in the Kenyan media.“We have lived with the pain of Agnes’s death for over a decade,” her family said in a statement earlier this week. “The reports that an arrest warrant has been issued against a UK citizen is a significant moment for us and is incredibly welcome.”No timeline has been set for any extradition hearing or future trial.A government spokesperson did not confirm whether a formal extradition request had been received by the home secretary.“Our thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru and we remain absolutely committed to helping them secure justice,” a UK government spokesperson said.“We understand that the Kenyan director of public prosecutions has determined that a British national should face trial in relation to the murder of Ms Wanjiru in 2012. This is subject to ongoing legal proceedings and we will not comment further at this stage.”The case is next listed for mention in court in Kenya on 21 October.Explore more on these topicsUK newsKenyanewsShareReuse this content"

His son Nick and daughter-in-law Lise have been constantly at his side and John died peacefully in hospital this morning.”Stapleton’s formerGMTVco-presenter Kate Garraway said she was “absolutely devastated to hear of the passing of my dear friend and journalistic hero”, describing him as a “rock solid broadcaster and the ultimate gentleman”.Charlotte Hawkins and Susanna Reid, fellow presenters of Good Morning Britain, also paid tribute. Reid described Stapleton as a “legend” and “consummate pro” who was “always good-humoured and gracious to work with”. Hawkins said he was a “brilliant broadcaster” and a “genuinely lovely man”.Nick Stapleton posted on Instagram that his father had not been happy living with Parkinson’s. He added: “It turns out he got what he wanted – to leave us on his terms, without suffering. Living independently and still doing the things he loved until almost the very end. I’m sad for me and my wife … but I’m happy for him.”Stapleton was a fan of Manchester City, who said in a post on X they were “saddened to learn” of his death. Nick said that when he and his father “watched them win the Champions League in Istanbul he turned to me and said he’d die happy. He meant it.”Stapleton, a presenter for Newsnight, Watchdog and GMTV’s News Hour,revealed his diagnosis with Parkinson’s diseasein October 2024.Appearing on ITV’s Good Morning Britain after announcing his diagnosis, he said: “There’s no point in being miserable … It won’t ever change. Parkinson’s is here with me now for the rest of my life. Best I can do is try and control it and take the advice of all the experts.”Stapleton was born in Oldham and began his working life as a trainee reporter in the north-west, before moving into television as a presenter on the BBC’s Nationwide and then forNewsnight, where he reported on conflicts around the world.He became a household name after moving into the world of light entertainment and consumer affairs. He presented the BBC’s Watchdog programme between 1985 and 1993 alongside his wife,Lynn Faulds Wood, who died in 2020.Watchdog was renowned for exposing shoddy workmanship and illegal working practices, with the team often confronting business owners.View image in fullscreenStapleton with Kirsty Wark and Jill Dando, fellow presenters of the BBC’s Breakfast Time programme, in 1988.Photograph: David Crump/Daily Mail/ShutterstockIn 2002, Stapleton found himself having a conversation with police officers after a segment on GMTV when a reporter was sent out to see how quickly they could acquire some cannabis in south London.After Stapleton showed the drugs on GMTV, some viewers complained and the police interviewed him, despite the fact he had made it clear thecannabis was to be destroyed immediatelyafter the show.Stapleton said: “I got a message down my earpiece from the producer that there had been a complaint and there was a Metropolitan police officer waiting to see me. I thought she was joking at first but a charming lady inspector was waiting on the studio floor and we had a little chat. She wanted to know how it came into my possession and that was it.”Stapleton was also part of the presenting team, alongside Sir Trevor McDonald and Roger Cook, for Carlton Television’scontroversial debate in 1997 about the monarchy, in which members of the public gave their views on the future of the royal family.The show, which was filmed at Birmingham’s National Exhibition Centre and included audible booing from the audience, who also heckled panellists, was described by the journalist Sir Robin Day as “the most contemptible programme I have ever watched”.Steve Clark, Carlton’s head of factual programmes at the time, defended the boisterous debate, asking: “Is the standard of debate in the House of Commons at Question Time any better than that?”It ended with a poll of 2.5 million callers, 66% of whom believed there should be a future for the monarchy.After revealing his Parkinson’s diagnosis in 2024, Stapleton went onBBCOne’s Morning Live to discuss his illness. “Speaking is how I’ve earned my living for the best part of 50 years,” he said. “It’s very frustrating sometimes, particularly [when] people are constantly saying to you: ‘Sorry, what did you say?’ And you have to repeat yourself, time and time again.“I am fairly pragmatic about the prospect of this getting worse. I try to remain positive, because what’s the point of not being?”He also partnered with Children in Need and sang a song from the musical & Juliet, after revealing that he used singing to cope with his diagnosis.Stapleton’s son, Nick, followed him into television, becoming the co-presenter of the Bafta-winning BBC daytime series Scam Interceptors.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionFactual TVBBCNewsnightGMTVnewsShareReuse this content"

I hate my opponents, and I don’t want the best for them, I’m sorry.”Trump’s speech was an awkward mix of eulogy and campaign speech, during which he frequently veered away from reading somber remarks about Kirk’s life and violent death to make offhand comments and jokes.View image in fullscreenPresident Donald Trump, seen on a stadium screen, speaks at the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Photograph: John Locher/APHe mentioned his use of federal forces to police cities and took a moment to promote an announcement at the White House on Monday. “I think we found an answer to autism. How about that? Autism: tomorrow we are going to be talking in the Oval Office in the White House about autism,” the president said.Trump also claimed Kirk had urged him to dispatch federal troops to Chicago. “One of the last things he said to me was ‘Please sir, save Chicago’. And we’re going to do that, we’re going to save Chicago, from horrible crime.”At the end of his remarks, after calling Erika Kirk back on stage, Trump acted more like he was at a rally than a memorial, mouthing the words to America the Beautiful in a comic manner and swaying side to side.Earlier,Vance eulogized Kirk in explicitly religious terms, calling him “a martyr for the Christian faith”, despite a lack of evidence that his religion played any role in the killing.“They tried to silence my friend Charlie Kirk, but today we speak with Charlie and for Charlie louder than ever,” the vice-president said. “The evil murderer who took Charlie from us expected us to have a funeral today – and instead, my friends, we have had a revival and celebration of Charlie Kirk and of his Lord Jesus Christ.”Vance also argued that Kirk, known for engaging with students, combined the traditions of Socrates and Christianity. “He was Athens and Jerusalem; the city of reason and the city of God in one person”, Vance said.Erika Kirk also stressed what she called the inspiration Kirk’s murder had given to his supporters to embrace Christianity. “After Charlie’s assassination, we didn’t see violence, we didn’t see rioting,” Kirk said, as applause swelled from the crowd, welcoming the implied contrast to the upheaval following the murders of George Floyd or Martin Luther King Jr. “We saw revival,” she said.“This past week, we saw people open a Bible for the first time in a decade,” Kirk said. “We saw people go to a church service for the first time in their entire lives.”“The answer to hate is not hate,” she added. “The answer we know from the Gospel is love, and always love, love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us.”Donald Trump Jr also described Kirk as a martyr. “Charlie joined a long line of courageous men and women who were murdered for what they believe,” he said.Trump Jr recounted traveling with Kirk on college campuses and receiving threats to their safety. “We went out there anyway, without fear. Charlie led the way. His message was clear then, and his message is clear now, we won’t back down,” he said.Stephen Miller, a top White House adviser, pledged to finish Kirk’s life’s work.“You thought you could kill Charlie Kirk,” Miller said. “You have made him immortal. You have immortalized Charlie Kirk, and now millions will carry on his legacy.”“To our enemies. You have nothing to give. You have nothing to offer. You have nothing to share but bitterness. We have beauty. We have light. We have goodness. We have determination. We have vision. We have strength.”The memorial service was being held at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, a 63,000-seat home of the Arizona Cardinals football team and the venue where Taylor Swiftlaunchedher Eras tour.The event mixed political rhetoric with Christian evangelism. Thousands of people wearing red, white and blue poured into the stadium and lines snaked several blocks before sunrise Sunday.View image in fullscreenPeople hold up Turning Point signs as they gather on the day of Charlie Kirk’s memorial service.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersJeffrey Barke, a physician with a large online following, went to the stadium with a group of friends from Orange county, California, on what he called a “pilgrimage of sorts” to honor Kirk’s life and legacy. He pledged to use own platform to aid in spreading “Charlie’s message”.Christina Sawick, wearing a “Trump was right about everything” hat, said she had been watching and listening to Kirk since 2016. On Sunday, she left her home in Mesa at 3am to attend his memorial service.She said she appreciated Kirk’s willingness to debate anyone regardless of their politics or background. “He didn’t sugarcoat anything,” she said. “He just wanted to be heard and he wanted everybody to be heard.”US secretary of state Marco Rubio praised Kirk’s impact on young men. “He sought to engage those he disagreed with, because he understood that we were not created to isolate ourselves from one another, but to engage,” Rubio said.A massive security presence, led by the US Secret Service, was in place, with the eventexpected to receivesecurity on par with the Super Bowl.

The spokesperson also said it was not believed the man was “attempting anything nefarious”.Americans are grappling with the killing and complicated legacy of the 31-year-old conservative “youth whisperer”, Trump ally and podcasting provocateur, who was shot and killed on 10 September in what prosecutors have labeled political violence – and which has deepened fears about the trajectory of a profoundly divided nation.Kirk was struck by a single bullet as he spoke before a crowd of 3,000 mostly college students at Utah Valley University, the first stop on his national “American Comeback” campus tour. Utah prosecutors have charged Tyler Robinson, 22, with capital murder in Kirk’s killing and said they will seek the death penalty.In the wake of Kirk’s death, Trump and his advisers have sought to cast blame on Democrats, even though elected leaders and party officials have uniformly condemned the killing. Officials have said they believe the suspect acted alone.Prosecutors have said they suspect Robinson killed Kirk because he personally had become sick of what he perceived to be Kirk’s “hatred”. But, citing three sources familiar with the investigation into Kirk’s killing, NBCreportedSaturday that federal authorities have not found any link between Robinson and leftwing groups, on which the Trump administration has threatened to crack down after the deadly shooting.View image in fullscreenPeople attend a memorial for Charlie Kirk in Glendale, Arizona, on Sunday.Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APFueled by an outpouring of grief and rage on the right, conservatives are demanding punishment for those who have mocked or disparaged Kirk – a campaign of retribution critics say mirrors the very cancel culture he railed against. Since his death, teachers, students, journalists and the late-night show host Jimmy Kimmel have beenfired, suspended or disciplinedover comments related to Kirk or his death, in a clampdown that free-speech advocates, democracy scholars and others say amounts to government censorship.Explore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingUS politicsUS crimeTrump administrationArizonaDonald TrumpJD VancenewsShareReuse this content"

I forgive him because it was what Christ did, and it is what Charlie would do.”Those in the stadium rose to their feet in applause.Prosecutors have charged Tyler Robinson, 22, of fatally shooting Charlie Kirk on 10 September at Utah Valley University (UVU). Robinson, of Utah, could face the death penalty if convicted.Authorities have said Robinson texted his partner after the shooting that he had had enough of Kirk’s “hatred”. In an interview with the New York Times published on Sunday, Erika Kirk said she had been asked whether she wants to see the suspect face the death penalty.Sheremarked: “I’ll be honest. I told our lawyer, I want the government to decide this. I do not want that man’s blood on my ledger.“Because when I get to heaven, and Jesus is like, ‘Uh, [an] eye for an eye? Is that how we do it?’ And that keeps me from being in heaven, from being with Charlie?”In her remarks at State Farm Stadium, Erika Kirk vowed to continue her husband’s work as the newly appointed leader of the group he founded, Turning Point USA.“The answer to hate is not hate,” she said. “The answer we know from the gospel is love and always love – love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us.”Kirk was shot dead during the first stop on his “American Comeback” tour of college campuses. His death has sparked a fierce political debate about the power of words, decency, rising violence and free speech.Many prominent conservatives have sought to cast blame on the left for Kirk’s assassination. Several speakers, including the president, demonized Democrats and accused them of fomenting violence, even though elected officials and party leaders condemned the murder.“I hate my opponents, and I don’t want the best for them,” Donald Trump said in his remarks at the memorial. The president added: “I’m sorry, Erika.”Kirk’s killing was the latest act of political violence that has targeted Republicans and Democrats in recent years.The hours-long service included remarks from several members of Trump’s Make America Great Again (Maga) movement, including the vice-president JD Vance, who was a close personal friend of Kirk’s.Explore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingUS politicsArizonanewsShareReuse this content"

Mourners obliged the red, white and blue “Sunday best” dress code, filling the at-capacity venue with stars, stripes and Maga hats.“We’ve got it from here,”said vice-president JD Vance, memorializing Kirk, his friend and the founder of the youth activist group Turning Point USA, as one of the most pre-eminent voices on the American right.Inside the domed stadium, emotions were already raw whenErika Kirk, Charlie’s widow, took the stage. She inhaled deeply and looked Heavenward then dabbed tears from her eyes and began her remarks before a rapt audience, Trump among them.She said her husband’s work was devoted to saving the “lost boys of the west” who lack direction and meaning, including the 22-year-old suspect charged with his murder. “That man,” she said, her chest heaving. “I forgive him.” A tearful crowd rose to its feet in sustained applause as Kirk cast her eyes upward.A political widow in an instant, Kirk will succeed her husband as the chief executive of the political movement he founded. “I will make you proud,” she said.Her words marked the emotional crest of an hours-long service that began with Christian worship songs and ended with a live performance by Lee Greenwood of God Bless the USA – anda speech from the presidentto a “nation in mourning”. “America loved Charlie Kirk,” Trump said, admiring the 31-year-old’s ability to “always draw a crowd”.Charlie Kirk memorial: Trump says he ‘hates’ his opponents at event attended by tens of thousandsRead moreAs the afternoon wore on, the speeches became sharper and more political – a battle cry that implored the government officials present to be aggressive in “wielding the sword against evil”. There were only a handful of explicit references toDemocratsand the left – but many speeches mixed personal remembrances of Kirk with a searing vilification of his ideological opponents.“To those trying to incite violence against us, those trying to foment hatred against us, what do you have? You have nothing,” said Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff, his voice rising with indignation.“You are nothing. You are wickedness. You are jealousy, you are envy, you are hatred. You are nothing. You can build nothing. You can produce nothing. You can create nothing. We are the ones who build.”Prosecutors have said Kirk was killed by a lone gunman, Tyler Robinson, who has been charged with capital murder and could face the death penalty if convicted. While authorities have not revealed a clear motive for the shooting, prosecutors say texts from Robinson indicated he had enough of Kirk’s “hatred”.“We are all Charlie Kirk now,” said Florida congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, who began her political career helping to “battle the socialist indoctrination on college campuses” as Turning Point USA’s national Hispanic outreach director.Before the memorial began, conservative media personalities and influencers circulated in the VIP section of the stadium. Colorado congresswoman Laura Boebert, wearing a blue blazer, mingled with Kyle Rittenhouse, who became a cause célèbre on the right after being acquitted of fatally shooting two men during protests against a police killing in Kenosha, Wisconsin.“Honored to be here,”tweetedbillionaire businessman and former Trump administration adviser Elon Musk.Musk was seated next to Trump, a reunification Turning Point USA spokesperson Andrew Kolvet said Kirk had wanted “so badly”.View image in fullscreenErika Kirk speaks at the event.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersEddie Wallin crossed the Atlantic to attend Kirk’s memorial. His journey took him from Sweden to Texas, where he rented a car and drove 17 hours to reach Glendale, subsisting on bananas and other provisions that he could eat behind the wheel.Wearing a white shirt emblazoned with the word “Freedom”, Wallin recalled meeting Kirk in 2019, during a trip to Texas. He said Kirk, smiling, told him he never expected to meet a Swedish conservative. Six years later, Wallin said he encountered Kirk again during the 2024 presidential election won by Trump and was surprised the organizer, by then a hugely prominent figure in Maga politics, remembered him.“After so many years, he remembered me,” Wallin said. “I will remember him for my whole life.”Friends and colleagues shared personal anecdotes, depicting Kirk as a tireless promoter of conservative cultural values and a “Maga warrior” who encouraged those he loved to get married and have “millions of kids”.Turning Point USA staff described Kirk’s journey from a teenager with an “idea and a folding table” into the leader of one of the most influential conservative youth movements of the modern era. One suggested Kirk was having “heavenly Fomo” – fear of missing out – looking down on the event, the largest in the organization’s history. The memorial, with Super-Bowl level security at the stadium where Taylor Swift launched her historic Eras tour, was pulled together in just 10 days.The stage bore stamps of a Turning Point production: columns of sparklers flared, red lights blinked and two large American flags featured prominently, atop the TV screens that reflected the program to the audience.Mike McCoy, Kirk’s former chief of staff, quoted philosopher Soren Kierkegaard: “The martyr dies and his rule has just begun.” The audience roared.Several speakers, including Trump, spoke of their shock at learning that Kirk had been fatally shot. Frank Turek was there on the Utah Valley University campus, standing feet from Kirk when he was struck by a single bullet. Turek recalled the harrowing minutes that followed, including a struggle to pull Kirk’s 6ft 5in frame into a car as medics performed first aid. “His face was looking at mine but he wasn’t looking at me,” Turek said. “He was looking past me, right into eternity.”Long before the speaking program began, mourners wiped their eyes, swayed to the music, their arms raised in worship. Parents brought young children – even babies – to the memorial. One father padded the lining of his jacket with diapers, as no bags were allowed under the rigorous security in place for the event.Near one of the entrance’s, Turning Point Action registered voters and handed out information to students interested in starting new chapters on their high school or college campuses – a political movement Erika Kirk vowed would grow “10 times greater through the power of his memory”.Several stands sold T-shirts with a sketch of Kirk and the text, “This is our turning point.”Many supporters and speakers vowed to carry on Kirk’s work.Vance puts Charlie Kirk’s Christian faith front and center – with an eye on 2028Read moreJeffrey Barke, a physician with a large online following, came with a group of friends from Orange county, California, on what he called a “pilgrimage of sorts” to honor Charlie Kirk’s legacy.“What you’re seeing here is not just a tribute to his movement, you’re seeing a revival of his message: faith, family, freedom,” Barke said, gesturing to the crowd of supporters. Though only 31, Kirk left a lasting spiritual and political legacy, Barke said.“I think every one of us needs to be a bit more uncomfortable than we’re used to in spreading Charlie’s message,” he said, pledging to use his own platform and social media presence to do so.Christina Sawick, wearing a “Trump was right about everything” hat, said she was inspired by the attendance to pay tribute to Kirk, whom she had followed since 2016. On Sunday, she left her home in Mesa at 3am to attend the service. Sawick said the country seems to have reached a turning point, and she hopes Americans will follow Kirk’s legacy.“I want people to get behind our president,” she said. “And that there’s nothing wrong with making America great again.”Explore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingUS politicsArizonaDemocratsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Local communities see them as ‘harbingers of gentrification’Such properties are a housing alternative for younger people, but longterm residents worry about being priced out of their homes and losing communityJenna ZazaSun 21 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 21 Sep 2025 07.02 EDTShareIn the heart of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, a property management firm has opened a 19-bed co-living complex with rooms as small as 74 sq ft for rent. For almost $1,900 a month, it is touting “authentic Brooklyn energy” on a block “with real local charm”.The firm, Cohabs, dubbed the site Crown 120. But for longtime residents, it was the Kingston Lounge, a storied jazz club and bar. Its transformation serves as a tangible reminder of cultural erasure and gentrification.When Cohabs presented the project in May 2023, some locals expressed concern. “This history [of the lounge] is people, it’s not just buildings,” Sarah Lazur, a member of Brooklyn community board 8,saidat a land use meeting.Co-living housing is similar to a college dormitory, where residents share a communal kitchen, bathroom and living spaces.While renters are drawn in by the promise of a built-in community, flexible leases and, in some cases, all-inclusive rent, some long-time dwellers of the neighborhoods they land in see fewer benefits. Co-living “is not something that is contributing to the longterm health and structure of the community”, added Lazur.Crown 120was eventually approved regardless. Its opening is one of many such sites across New York City, where co-living has been rapidly expanding as a housing alternative for gen Z and younger millennial renters. The encroachment of these developments into traditionally working-class neighborhoods like Crown Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bushwick has fueled anger among residents who fear displacement and loss.“These houses are really designed to create connections for our members,” Elisa Richou, Cohabs’ US head of partnerships and brand growth, said. “New York City can be overwhelming, but beautiful and magical sometimes and we really just wanted to create a safe space.”Within five years of Cohabs’ New York debut, they developed 23 houses, each fitted with luxury amenities like a gym and cinema room. Their members are mainly younger professionals in their 20s and typically from overseas, looking to start a new chapter of their lives.View image in fullscreenA co-living space in Bedford, Brooklyn.Photograph: Evgenia RigautGabriela Caribe, 25, who works in international affairs, has been living in a Cohabs building for almost two years. Originally from Brazil, Caribe’s company assigned her to their New York office initially for a six-month stint, before she pushed for a longer contract.“It feels like home to me,” she said. “I share my life, and I build my life here, with my housemates, and it’s the whole reason I stayed in New York for this long.”Living at the site “really creates an instant community that you’re a part of”, said Caribe. “I had lived with one roommate before, but with co-living, it’s just much better. I will definitely continue to do this.”It comes at a premium price tag. At Cohabs, some rooms can cost more than $2,400. Richou says they are not just selling housing, but experiences in “up-and-coming” neighborhoods.Celestina León, Brooklyn community board 4’s district manager, sees things differently. These developments are “harbingers of gentrification and a loss of community”, she said.“Being a transitional population, they’re not necessarily being set up to be a good neighbor,” said León. “They’re basically set up to have a Bushwick experience, and then go on their way. And it’s very insulting.”Residents at Cohabs sites do not typically stick around for long. Its average members’ stay is 11 months, according to Richou.Some of those who have lived in affected neighborhoods for years worry about the lasting impact of such brief stays. At the May 2023 land use meeting where Crown 120 was discussed, Lazur called co-living developments the “antithesis” of community and an “unofficial hotel for European tourists”.Such fears aren’t unfounded, according to Kevin Dalton, a real estate agent at Compass, who explained that the conversion of single and two-family homes into units holding up to as many as 34 people can lead to a significantly higher rent roll – and increase rent in the area.Crown Heights, Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant “are becoming more and more desirable”, Dalton said. “They’re not as far along in the process of gentrification as Williamsburg, but you see the writing on the wall.”Lisa Atkinson, a former member of Brooklyn community board 8, claimed at the land use meeting in May 2023 that residents were being priced out of the community. “They’re leaving because they cannot afford it because developers like your company [are] coming in,” she said.Community board 8 declined to comment.Daniel Clark, Cohabs’ US general manager, said the company engages with communities before opening developments, to ease concern about gentrification and displacement. The firm “tries to be responsible” by highlighting local businesses to their members, Clark said, as a way to invest back into the neighborhood.But Caribe, the Cohabs tenant, thinks differently. Co-living houses “are a bit of isolated bubbles, in the middle of very historical communities”, she said. “Co-living spaces are expanding so fast that you’re losing a bit of the community’s heritage and roots of the neighborhood, especially since many members aren’t New Yorkers.”But at the same time, she added, “you need to open space for young people to come in and start living in the city and what young people want is community and co-living”.Despite New York’s net housing stock growing by 60,000 additional units in two years, it’s barely meeting demand, with nearly 275,000 new households. The city’s vacancy rate also dropped from 4.54% to 1.4%, the lowest recorded since 1968, according toHousingPreservation and Development.The rapid rise of co-living has prompted calls for specific regulations to prevent mismanagement and tenant abuse. “It’s so pervasive, and there is so much money that there is a lot of potential for abuse, corruption,” Dalton said. “Regulation is something that does need to happen.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkHousingCommunitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The idea of a 2% wealth tax on fortunes worth more than €100m has been proposed byGabriel Zucman, an economics professorwho has become a household name in France.The economist argues that the tax – named the Zucman tax by others – could help France with its squeezed budget. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, this month appointed a new prime minister,Sébastien Lecornu, after the centrist François Bayroufailed to win support for an austerity budget.Arnault –previously the world’s richest man– claimed that a 2% wealth tax would be an “offensive, which is deadly for our economy”. He also said he was “certainly the largest individual taxpayer and one of the largest professional taxpayers through the companies I run” in France.Arnault’s net worth stood at $169bn (£125bn) on Friday, mainly because of his 48% stake in LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, according to Bloomberg. After joining his family company and turning it from construction to property, Arnault grew his fortune by buying up brands ranging from the jewellers Bulgari and Tiffany & Co, the fashion houses ChristianDiorand Celine, to perfumes and whiskey brand Glenmorangie.Arnault, who lives in Paris, sparked a French national debate over tax in 2012when he sought Belgian citizenship. However, in April 2013, he withdrew his application as “a gesture of my attachment to France and my faith in its future”, according to Bloomberg.Zucman is a professor of economics at the Paris School of Economics and the École normale supérieure, and last yearwrote a prominent studyon the wealth tax for the G20. In June,Zucman wrote in the Guardian: “Unprecedented wealth concentration – and the unbridled power that comes with such wealth – has distorted our democracy and is driving societal and economic tensions.”The wealth tax could raise as much as €20bn, according to Zucman. However, other economists have argued that it would raise only €5bn if the ultra-wealthy leaveFrance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The last, to DeVonta Smith with 1:48 left, gave Philadelphia a 27-26 lead but the two-point conversion failed.Matthew Stafford drove the Rams 44 yards in 10 plays to set up Karty’s 44-yard attempt before Davis delivered the heroic walk-off play. Jalen Carter had blocked Karty’s 36-yard try with 8:46 left.Held to 33 yards of offense in the first half, Philadelphia improbably rebounded for their 12th straight home win and 19th victory in their last 20 games overall, including last season’s run to a Super Bowl championship.Dallas Cowboys 14-31 Chicago BearsCaleb Williams tied a career high with four touchdown passes and the Chicago Bears (1-2) gave Ben Johnson his first win as a head coach by beating the Dallas Cowboys (1-2). The Bears got a win they sorely needed coming off a 52-21 blowout loss at Detroit. Johnson called out his team’s practice habits during the week. But he had to like what he saw against the Cowboys. Johnson’s offense broke off several big plays in racking up 385 yards. It added up to a rough day for Dallas defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus in his first appearance at Soldier Field since the Bears fired him as head coach last November.Green Bay Packers 10-13 Cleveland BrownsAndre Szmyt kicked a 55-yard field goal as time expired and the Cleveland Browns rallied from a 10-0 deficit with under four minutes left to beat the Green Bay Packers.The Browns (1-2) snapped an eight-game losing streak dating to last season when it appeared for much of the game they might be shut out. But the defense kept them in it with four sacks and came up with the key turnover which resulted in it being tied.Green Bay (2-1) appeared as if they might win with a last-minute field goal when they drove to the Browns 25, but Shelby Harris blocked a 43-yard field goal attempt by Brandon McManus and Greg Newsome II recovered at the 47.Cleveland took over and went 16 yards in five plays. Joe Flacco had an eight-yard completion on third-and-two to get the ball to the Packers 35. Flacco then spiked the ball, bringing Szmyt on with two seconds remaining. It was redemption for the rookie kicker, who missed an extra point and field goal in a 17-16 loss to Cincinnati in Week 1.New York Jets 27–29 Tampa Bay BuccaneersIncredibly, there were more crucial blocked field goals on Sunday. Chase McLaughlin’s fifth field goal was a 36-yarder with no time remaining to give the Tampa Bay Buccaneers victory over the visiting New York Jets.not a bad first TD of your career@WILL_JUN1OR📺:#NYJvsTBon FOXpic.twitter.com/itAM2FwjB0— New York Jets (@nyjets)September 21, 2025McLaughlin’s winning kick came after the Buccaneers (3-0) blew a 17-point, fourth-quarter lead. New York (0-3) went ahead by a point when Will McDonald IV blocked a field goal and scored on a 50-yard return with 1:49 remaining. Jamel Dean returned an interception for touchdown and Baker Mayfield threw a touchdown pass to Mike Evans as the Buccaneers recorded their first 3-0 start since 2005. Mayfield completed 19 of 29 passes for 233 yards.Pittsburgh Steelers 21-14 New England PatriotsAaron Rodgers threw a go-ahead 17-yard touchdown pass to Calvin Austin III with 2:16 left, and the Pittsburgh Steelers (2-1) beat the New England Patriots (1-2). Rodgers passed for 139 yards and two touchdowns, Kenneth Gainwell ran for a one-yard TD and the Steelers’ defense forced five turnovers to help Pittsburgh win at New England for the first time since 2008. The Steelers had lost four since then in Foxborough, including the AFC championship game in the 2016 season. The Patriots were driving with a chance to tie and had fourth-and-one at the Pittsburgh 28, but DeMario Douglas caught a pass from Drake Maye and was stopped for a one-yard loss. Rodgers also moved into fourth place in careerNFLTD passes with 510. He trails Tom Brady (649), Drew Brees (571) and Peyton Manning (539).Denver Broncos 20–23 Los Angeles ChargersJustin Herbert found Keenan Allen for a tying touchdown with 2:44 remaining and then led Los Angeles into position for Cameron Dicker’s game-ending 43-yard field goal as the Chargers beat the Denver Broncos for their first 3-0 start since 2002. After Herbert eluded the Broncos’ pass rush and connected with Allen, Bo Nix and the Broncos went three-and-out. That set up Herbert and the Chargers on their 32, and he went 4 of 4 on the final drive. Herbert was 28 of 47 for 300 yards with the TD and one interception. The Broncos fell to 1-2.New Orleans Saints 13–44 Seattle SeahawksRookie Tory Horton returned a punt 95 yards for a touchdown – the longest punt return in Seahawks franchise history – and caught one of Sam Darnold’s two TD passes in Seattle’s rout of the winless New Orleans Saints. Kenneth Walker III ran for two TDs for the Seahawks (2-1), with the first set up by another big play on special teams. D’Anthony Bell blocked a punt by Kai Kroeger deep in New Orleans territory, and Walker’s three-yard run gave Seattle a 21-0 first-quarter lead. Seattle led 38-6 at the break for the second-highest-scoring half in franchise history. The Saints’ Spencer Rattler fell to 0-9 as a starter.Arizona Cardinals 15–16 San Francisco 49ersEddy Pineiro has kicked a 35-yard field goal to give the San Francisco 49ers a narrow win over the Arizona Cardinals. This marks the 49ers’ third straight win to open the season. San Francisco overcame an injury to Nick Bosa and the absence of starting quarterback Brock Purdy. Rookie Upton Stout broke up a pass to force a punt, allowing Mac Jones to lead a game-winning drive. The Cardinals had taken the lead with a rare tiebreaking safety in the fourth quarter. Both teams traded touchdowns in the fourth quarter, but Pineiro’s kick sealed the victory.Las Vegas Raiders 24–41 Washington CommandersA reconfigured Commanders (2-1) offense led by quarterback Marcus Mariota produced 201 yards on the ground, 174 in the first half alone, to help Washington beat the Las Vegas Raiders (1-2). Mariota filled in for an injured Jayden Daniels, making his first NFL start since 2022 with Atlanta. He went 15 for 21 for 207 yards through the air and ran six times for 40 yards, including a two-yard TD. Washington scored via a 43-yard TD pass by Mariota, a 60-yard run by Jeremy McNichols, a one-yard plunge by Jacory “Bill” Croskey-Merritt and a 90-yard punt return by Jaylin Lane. Raiders QB Geno Smith threw three TD passes to Tre Tucker and was sacked five times.Houston Texans 10–17 Jacksonville JaguarsTrevor Lawrence found Brian Thomas Jr for a 46-yard gain, Travis Etienne scored on the next play and the Jacksonville Jaguars held on to beat the Houston Texans . It was Jacksonville’s first win over the Texans at home since 2017. Houston had won 12 of the previous 14 in the AFC South series. This one was decided on the final two drives. The Jaguars (2-1) got a huge play from Lawrence to Thomas, and then the Texans (0-3) seemingly let Etienne score from 10 yards out with 1:48 remaining. CJ Stroud drove Houston into striking distance, but Josh Hines-Allen tipped his pass and Antonio Johnson intercepted the wobbler to seal the victory.Cincinnati Bengals 10–48 Minnesota VikingsIsaiah Rodgers helped make Carson Wentz’s debut at quarterback for Minnesota (2-1) a rousing success. Rodgers set a Vikings record with two defensive touchdowns and forced three of Cincinnati’s five turnovers in a romp that was the worst loss in Bengals history. Jordan Mason rushed for 116 yards and two scores on just 16 attempts, Will Reichard made a 62-yard field goal – the longest in Vikings history – as the first half ended and Wentz threw for two touchdowns over three quarters. Jake Browning was picked off twice in a rough start for the Bengals (2-1), who missed Joe Burrow in their first game since their quarterback had toe surgery.Indianapolis Colts 41–20 Tennessee TitansDaniel Jones threw for 228 yards and a touchdown while Jonathan Taylor rushed for 102 yards and three scores as the visiting Indianapolis Colts stayed unbeaten with a lop-sided win over the Tennessee Titans. Jones completed 18 of 25 passes as Indianapolis (3-0) cruised through their first road game of the year. The Colts led for all but 49 seconds of the game, although they did have to punt for the first time this year at the 9:13 mark of the second quarter. Tennessee rookie Cam Ward connected on 23 of 38 passes for 219 yards and a touchdown, along with an interception that Kenny Moore II returned 32 yards for a score on the game’s third play. The Titans (0-3) are 3-17 since the start of the 2024 season.Atlanta Falcons 0-30 Carolina PanthersThe Carolina Panthers (1-2) earned their first win of the season, defeating the Atlanta Falcons 30-0. Bryce Young ran for a touchdown, while Chau Smith-Wade returned an interception for a score. Rookie Ryan Fitzgerald contributed with three field goals. Young completed 16 of 24 passes for 121 yards, avoiding turnovers after struggling in previous games. The Panthers intercepted Michael Penix Jr twice and forced three turnovers. The Falcons (1-2) struggled offensively, with Bijan Robinson being the lone standout with 111 yards from scrimmage. It was Carolina’s first shutout since 2020.Explore more on these topicsNFLPhiladelphia EaglesLos Angeles RamsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Mikel Arteta had started with the dial turned towards caution but, by the time the board went up to show seven minutes of stoppage time, the manager had torn off the handbrake, sending on attacking substitutes, praying that one of his finishers could come up trumps.It was attack versus defence, as it had been throughout, but now it was a ridiculously extreme version. Pep Guardiola had everybody back, hisManchester Cityteam set up in a 5-4-1 formation, desperately holding on to the advantage given to them by Erling Haaland in the ninth minute.Arsenal 1-1 Manchester City: Premier League player ratingsRead moreThe breakthrough seemed to have come in a different age, Haaland running through to finish for his seventh City goal in six appearances this season. Thereafter, his team defended. And they defended some more. It was a war of attrition. Guardiola withdrew Phil Foden, he withdrew Haaland. He introduced more defensive players. Was it really him?City finished with 32.8% of the possession; the lowest number for a Guardiola team in 601 top-flight games. They looked leggy, which was unsurprising given they had played in the Champions Leagueat home to Napolion Thursday night. Arsenal had theirEuropean fixture at Athletic Bilbaoin a Tuesday tea-time kick-off. One question: why did Guardiola name an unchanged side?City looked set to stagger over the line; the hardest-fought of three points were within their grasp. Then Arsenal made it happen. Arteta’s team looked to have run out of ideas. But when one substitute, Eberechi Eze, saw another, Gabriel Martinelli, begin a run in behind the City backline, his lob was made to measure.Martinelli’s finish was outstanding. The first touch was true and, with the outside of his right boot, he managed the not insignificant feat of lifting the ball up and over Gianluigi Donnarumma and down into the far corner. Cue joy, relief, bedlam; the full heady cocktail for Arsenal. Arteta’s celebrations were arguably the wildest.It was not the result that Arsenal wanted and it was hard not to see the league leaders, Liverpool, as the biggest beneficiaries. Even when they are not scoring the last-gasp goals themselves, they are working for them. But for Arteta and Arsenal, it was at least something.Arteta had gone with another of his midfield muscle lineups. In the injury-enforced absence of Martin Ødegaard, he did not try Eze in the No 10 role at the outset; rather he went for Mikel Merino. He also preferred Leandro Trossard to Eze on the left. There were echoes of the approach in the 1-0defeat at Liverpoolat the end of August. The plan for solidity would be hit hard early on.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland resists doing a Zen celebration after scoring.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesArsenal brought the press, with Gabriel Magalhães tight to Haaland in a congested central space midway inside the City half. But the striker’s solution was to turn the ball up and around the corner to send Tijjani Reijnders racing upfield. Arsenal were exposed and Haaland did not hang around to admire his work. He eased up through the gears to give Reijnders an option to the right of centre and, when the pass was played, the weight on it just right, the finish was a formality.City were initially 4-4-2 out of possession, Bernardo Silva alongside Haaland, and Arsenal’s challenge was to navigate through the thick blue lines. They forced a handful of first-half corners and there were flickers from Noni Madueke on the right. But what could they look back on at the interval in terms of chances? Their only real one followed a drop of the shoulder by Madueke and a blast for the near corner. Donnarumma repelled it with a mighty paw.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also brought on Bukayo Saka, who was back in the squad after a hamstring injury, for Madueke. There was a more positive energy about Arsenal upon the restart; inside the stadium, too. It was not that City were penned back more. They could hardly get any deeper. It was that Arsenal had greater urgency. Saka was in the mood. Martín Zubimendi shot high from the edge of the area. Eze thumped a half-volley at Donnarumma.City almost landed the counterpunch in the 57th minute, Haaland barrelling up the inside left onto a Jérémy Doku pass and he had Foden square for the tap-in. Haaland took on the shot and David Raya saved. But really, the question concerned whether City could hold firm.Guardiola sent on Nathan Aké for Foden on 68 minutes and went to the back five. The next eyebrow-raiser was Nico González for Haaland in the 76th minute, Doku going into the No 9 position. It was so unusual to see Guardiola play this way, to sacrifice the aesthetic. The result was all that mattered.Arteta went through agonies in his technical area because it was so difficult for his players to find any spaces. After the burst at the start of the second half, it descended into a slog. Frustration replaced optimism in the stands.Arteta sent on Martinelli for Jurriën Timber and went to a back three. He also got Ethan Nwaneri on as an extra central attacking midfielder. The system was 3-2-4-1; in other words, all or nothing. Martinelli had made the difference off the bench in Bilbao, scoring one and setting up the other in the 2-0 win. Here, he was the match-saver.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Young raced back and got twisted around with the ball tailing back over his head.He turned his body and leaped at the wall, but the ball was jarred out of his glove when he hit the fence. The ball never touched the wall, however, and a stumbling Young kicked it back up into the air with his right foot – hacky-sack style – before gloving it a second time for a circus catch.Umpires immediately ruled Baty out as he sprinted around second base.In the ninth inning, Alvarez led off with a high line drive to deep left-center field. Young again raced back and jumped, this time catching the ball cleanly at the top of the fence to help preserve a 3-2 victory.New York, who have lost 11 of 15, began the day with a one-game lead over Cincinnati for the final National League wildcard spot. The loss, combined with the Reds’ win over the Chicago Cubs, put the teams even with 80 wins each. However the Reds hold the tiebreaker after they won the series between the teams earlier this season.The Mets, who have the second-highest payroll inMLB, were 21 games above .500 at one point this season but have been plagued by poor starting pitching, blown leads and costly errors in the second-half of the season.Explore more on these topicsMLBNew York MetsWashington NationalsBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

In what is a highly controversial move, Bradley and his 12-man side will each collect $500,000 (£370,000) – $300,000 of which must be directed towards charity, with the rest labelled a stipend – while the European contingent continue to perform at the Ryder Cup for free. Added to the mix is the fact that tickets start at $750 per tournament day.Much has been made of likely antipathy from the New York audience towards Donald and his players as Europe look to retain the trophy theywon in Rome two years ago. However, the Englishman believes USA could find themselves under intense gallery pressure if Europe gain an upper hand. “That could happen,” said Donald. “We all know how high the ticket prices are, and it’s going to be an expensive trip out for a family of four. If the US players are getting paid a stipend, or whatever it is, and they aren’t performing, the New Yorkers could make them know about it.”‘My time in the sun’: Rory McIlroy on Ryder Cup hopes and Masters gloryRead moreDonald, who also led Europe in 2023, seems comfortable that the visitors have avoided the cash element despite theRyder Cupescalating as a commercial entity. “I wanted to get ahead of this when I first heard about it last year and looked like it was likely going to happen,” Donald said of the USA team being paid. “I reached out to all the 12 guys from Rome to see how they felt. Their voices are important. Everyone was like: ‘We haven’t even considered playing for money for that event.’“We just don’t see that. We understand what it represents. We have a great purpose and that’s really enough for us. We understand that the money raised goes to help the European Tour Group and the grassroots. We talk a lot about this, we are here to inspire the next generation. So this money is going to good things. It will hopefully help future Ryder Cup players become great players. I think our purpose, why we play the Ryder Cup, is pretty strong and that’s enough for that week.“It speaks to what the Ryder Cup means to these guys. A couple of hundred thousand dollars to these guys isn’t a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. Those weeks of the Ryder Cup, they are the best weeks. There’s so much more to them. We certainly don’t need any motivation or monetary rewards to get us up.”View image in fullscreenThe victorious European team in Rome in 2023.Photograph: Marco Iacobucci/ShutterstockDonald’s level of grit is often underplayed. The 47-year-old is softly spoken but lacks nothing in competitive steel. “There’s plenty of anger and a chip on my shoulder underneath,” he said. “I want to win. When I was No 1 in the world, I would look at any slight towards me and use that as motivation.“I certainly could have easily walked away a couple years ago after a great job in Rome and people were pleased. This is a great challenge. To have this opportunity, to push yourself to try to do something that’s very difficult to do, that’s pretty motivating for me. Hopefully we can do it.”By Sunday night Donald could become the first European captain since Tony Jacklin to win home and away Ryder Cups. Recent records suggest he faces an uphill task, with the Europeans without a win on US soil since 2012, but the captain is keen to accentuate positives. Donald’s 10 ½ points from 15 matches when a player stands out as an exceptional modern day return and was a key part of the Miracle of Medinah 13 years ago. Donald will be assisted in New York by Thomas Bjørn, José María Olazábal, Alex Norén and the Molinari brothers, Edoardo and Francesco.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet the British driver, try as he might, could make no headway, starting in seventh and finishing in the same place.Piastri will consider himself lucky that what might have been a huge swing in Norris’s favour was averted. As it was, he dropped only six points and still enjoys a 25-point advantage with seven meetings remaining. The British driver was left to rue not doing better in qualifying, as a start near the front would have likely netted him a hatful.What was most striking about Piastri foundering was that it stood in such stark contrast to the cool equanimity with which the 24-year-old has handled being in a title fight in only his third season in the sport. It also suggests that as the pressure continues to build as he and Norris vie for the title, closing it out remains the hardest task of all.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri climbs out of his car after crashing on the first lap of the F1 Azerbaijan GP.Photograph: Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty ImagesIt was McLaren’s worst weekend of the season at a race where they could have sealed the constructors’ title, with both drivers compromised from qualifying. Piastri clattered out on Saturday, once more too hot into a corner, and his Sunday went from bad to worse.While Verstappen shot away from pole into a lead he would not relinquish, Piastri had a shocking launch from ninth. He made a jump-start, then stopped the car; anti-stall kicked in and left him mired and dropped to last.Chasing places, he went into turn five, underestimated his lack of grip in the dirty air from the field in front and was helpless as he ploughed into the wall, ending a 34-race scoring streak. It left the Australian stony-faced at the side of the track watching the race unfold after a weekend to forget.Piastri has shown only rare moments of misjudgment this season and while he held his hands up, tried to take what little comfort he could from a weekend he must hope is but a minor case of the yips.“Qualifying yesterday was what it was,” he said. “Then Sunday, just more silly mistakes. It was certainly a messy weekend.“I would be more concerned if I was slow and trying to make up for it that way and having errors because of that. The fact that they’re just simple lapses in judgment, if I am trying to find a silver lining then I suppose I have that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was confined to stately locomotion pretty much all afternoon.McLaren’s attempt at going long on his tyres was stymied partly by a slow pit stop, which potentially cost him three places, and at the close, despite fresher rubber, not having enough of a pace advantage to make a difference against Liam Lawson and Yuki Tsunoda, who took fifth and sixth.Verstappen, by contrast, was absolutely serene in giving a demonstration of what a title fight this might have been had Red Bull given him a more consistently competitive car.McLaren’s team principal, Andrea Stella, has refused to count him out as a title contender, even given the points gap means it remains a slim chance. Verstappen has now closed what was a 94-point deficit to 69. It is a mountain to climb but the world champion may enjoy giving McLaren sweaty palms at the very least.Quick GuideF1 Azerbaijan GP results and standingsShow1Max Verstappen(Neth) Red Bull1hr 33min 26.408sec2George Russell(GB) Mercedes GP+14.6093Carlos Sainz Jr(Sp) Williams +19.1994Andrea Kimi Antonelli(It) Mercedes +21.7605Liam Lawson(NZ) Racing Bulls +33.2906Yuki Tsunoda(Jpn) Red Bull +33.8087Lando Norris(GB) McLaren +34.2278Lewis Hamilton(GB) Ferrari +36.3109Charles Leclerc(Mon) Ferrari +36.77410Isack Hadjar(Fr) RB +38.98211Gabriel Bortoleto(Br) Sauber +1:07.60612Oliver Bearman(GB) Haas +1:08.26213Alexander Albon(Tha) Williams +1:12.87014Esteban Ocon(Fr) Haas +1:17.58015Fernando Alonso(Sp) Aston Martin +1:18.70716Nico Hülkenberg(Ger) Sauber +1:20.23717Lance Stroll(Can) Aston Martin +1:36.39218Pierre Gasly(Fr) Alpine +1 lap19Franco Colapinto(Arg) Alpine +1 lapNot classifiedOscar Piastri (Aus) McLaren 0 laps completed.Fastest LapVerstappen (Neth) Red Bull 1:43.388 on lap 50.Drivers' championship standings1Oscar Piastri(Aus) 324pts, 2Lando Norris(GB) 299, 3Max Verstappen(Neth) 255, 4George Russell(GB) 212, 5Charles Leclerc(Mon) 165, 6Lewis Hamilton(GB) 121, 7Kimi Antonelli(It) 78, 8Alexander Albon(Tha) 70, 9Isack Hadjar(Fr) 39, 10Nico Hülkenberg(Ger) 37, 11Lance Stroll(Can) 32, 12Carlos Sainz Jr(Sp) 31, 13Liam Lawson(NZ) 30, 14Fernando Alonso(Sp) 30, 15Esteban Ocon(Fr) 28, 16Pierre Gasly(Fr) 20, 17Yuki Tsunoda(Jpn) 20, 18Gabriel Bortoleto(Br) 18, 19Oliver Bearman(GB) 16, 20Franco Colapinto(Arg) 0, 21Jack Doohan(Aus) 0.Constructors' championship standings1McLaren623pts, 2Mercedes290, 3Ferrari286, 4Red Bull272, 5Williams101, 6Racing Bulls72, 7Aston Martin62, 8Sauber55, 9Haas44, 10Alpine20.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Behind him George Russell took a well-earned second from fifth despite suffering from illness all weekend but his pleasure in grinding it out was overshadowed by the sheer unadulterated delight from Carlos Sainz, who made the most of a mixed-up grid to take a superb third in his first season with Williams.

Over 5,000m in Tokyo the American reinforced the message even more emphatically.When the bell rang for the final lap Hocker was in 11th place, and close to 15 metres off the lead. But he quickly began picking off his rivals before timing his final surge to perfection to take gold in 12min 58.30sec, ahead of Belgium’s Isaac Kimeli, with Jimmy Gressier adding bronze to his 10,000m gold.World Athletics Championships: USA dominate table again as GB suffer worst finish since 2003Read moreHocker later wasted no time in claiming vindication after being controversially disqualified last week for “jostling” in the semi‑finals of the 1500m. “I wanted to end the world championships on my terms,” he said.“I felt like I was robbed in the 1500m. I knew I had the opportunity today and that I had the legs to take this field. I had a lot of bodies ahead of me but I felt very strong; enough to pass them one by one.“I felt like I raced perfectly. Every time I run the 5,000m I am pushed out of my comfort zone. I felt here that I was working every lap. I make music on my computer and play some guitar and piano. Now I want to eat a lot of Japanese food. I just want to eat and drink.”There was further success for the USA team on the final night in Tokyo in the women’s 4x100m relay, as Sha’Carri Richardson led them home ahead of Jamaica in a raging storm that left the track covered in surface water.It meant that Melissa Jefferson‑Wooden, the 100m and 200m champion, finished with a third title. “It’s crazy to be going home with three gold medals,” she said. “I added my name to the history books once again. I am right where I want to be.”The great Jamaican sprinter Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who has won 25 Olympic and world medals in a career stretching back to 2007, was more than happy to settle for silver in her final race.View image in fullscreenJamaica’s Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce embraces the Germany team after the women’s 4x100m final, winning a silver in what was the last race of her career.Photograph: Petr David Josek/AP“I have had an amazing career and today’s medal is the icing on the cake,” she said. “My son will be excited. Today is a full circle moment for me. I was a reserve at my first world championships in Osaka in 2007. I couldn’t have it any other way.“I am grateful for the medals, the stadiums and the crowds where I have competed throughout my career. I have some plans and I want to focus on advocacy and support women and athletes. I want to continue to make an impact.”Germany took bronze after Gina Lückenkemper held off Darryl Neita. “I wasn’t sure we had won a medal when I crossed the line because we were in an outside lane,” she said. “And then Daryll Neita from GB, she told me. She’s like: ‘Girl, you’ve got it.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Suryakumar dedicated India’s victory to their armed forces, while several of his teammates expressed similar thoughts on social media.A furious Pakistan considered withdrawing from the tournament to protest against the match referee, Andy Pycroft, who they say condoned unsportsmanlike behaviour by India. They delayed their match against United Arab Emirates by an hour on Wednesday and went ahead with the game only after an apology from Pycroft and the assurance of an inquiry by the InternationalCricketCouncil.Once play was under way, a 105-run opening stand between Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill helped the defending champions to secure victory. Put in to bat, Pakistan set India a target of 172, which they reached with seven balls remaining.A 72-run partnership between Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub for the second wicket laid the foundation for Pakistan’s innings after Fakhar Zaman (15) fell early.

It’s by far one of the best teams in Europe. I would prefer to play another way, but when we play a lot of games in 10 years [as City manager], the teams defend deep, deep, deep and take a result of fantastic performance, mindset, strategy … Sometimes it happens. You have to defend, honestly. It’s because the opponent is better. When you have to accept it, you have to survive in that way. And we did it.”Asked about the possession statistics, he said: “One time in 10 years is not bad, right? I have to prove myself against another strategy. Now I am a transition team.”Having finished as runners-up for the past three seasons, Arsenal are five points behind Liverpool, the league leaders, after five games. Arteta refused to accept criticism over his decision to select Mikel Merino ahead of Eberechi Eze after the England forward came off the bench at half-time and set up the equaliser. But he recognised that service must improve to Viktor Gyökeres, after the new £55m striker did not register a shot during the match.“To have very big open chances is extremely difficult, but he’s certainly trying his best and trying to do that, and we have to provide more for him,” Arteta said. “There were a lot of situations when the chances were there and then especially the final pass was missing today.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalManchester CitynewsShareReuse this content"

It was a painting of his late father, done by a close friend, attached to the wall in his corner office, and his affection for that gift summed up his deep love for family, which is just one reason why the thoughts of so many people in women’s football turned immediately to his wife, children and all of his loved ones, afterthe shocking news of his deathat the age of 47.The Beard family’s loss is being felt all across the sport on a deeply sad weekend for the women’s game, as he is remembered for his way of making people laugh and his ability to win football matches. Straight-talking in press conferences, but then charming off the microphone, he made time for fans, for fundraising events and for the pub. Some saw him as the “Del Boy of women’s football”, good at finding a bargain in the transfer market and fiercely proud of his London roots, but as a coach he was certainly no plonker – his achievements as a manager make him the most successful women’s‑team coach in Liverpool’s history and undoubtedly one of the best of the Women’s Super League era. Even before the division was founded in 2011, he was already a key figure in the development of the women’s game and he fiercely championed its growth long before it entered the mainstream.Liverpool’s WSL match at Aston Villa postponed after Matt Beard’s deathRead moreHis Liverpool side securing back-to-back WSL titles in 2013 and 2014 stamped his name into the history books for certain, but he had already led Chelsea to their first FA Cup final in 2012, and before that he had guided Millwall Lionesses to promotion in 2009. He had a spell in the US coaching Boston Breakers – and he would later joke about nobody there being able to understand his cockney accent – before taking another club to their first FA Cup final in 2019, this time West Ham.He had a short interim spell in charge of Bristol City – which included a League Cup final appearance, although, modestly, he was always at pains to credit that run to the club’s head coach, Tanya Oxtoby, for whom he was covering during maternity leave – before he returned in 2021 to manage Liverpool, where he was loved by so many supporters and staff. Back on Merseyside, he guided Liverpool to promotion back to the WSL with the second‑tier title in 2022, and two years later they clinched a fourth‑placed finish in the top flight, disrupting the modern, so‑called big four in spite of their smaller playing budget.View image in fullscreenMatt Beard and his Liverpool team celebrate winning the WSL in 2013.Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesObserving him during matches, he was as competitive as anyone in his demeanour on the touchline and he probably set a record for the highest number of expletives yelled in frustration every season, often aimed at the match officials. Nevertheless, there was always a level of respect and the former WSL referee Cheryl Foster was among the countless people to pay tribute to Beard on social media on Saturday night. And naturally, for a coach who worked at so many top-level women’s clubs, the tributes have been widespread and heartfelt. The former England and Chelsea goalkeeper Carly Telford wrote on X: “There aren’t enough words for Matt Beard, he believed in the women’s game when few did … he cared for us all as if we were his daughters, and he always always had time for anyone and everyone … he made a bad day better!

That brief spell with the club did not last and he stood down in August, but he frequently expressed a view that football was nowhere near as important as the key things in life. For example, when he left Liverpool in February, I phoned him a couple of days later just to check how he was doing, and I mistakenly expected to hear a sad tone. Instead, he chirped: “I’ve never been better, I’ve just been for a hike with my son!” BothBurnley’s and Liverpool’s matches on Sunday were postponed, as players and staff grieve.In a statement issued via the League Managers Association, Emma Hayes said: “Matt Beard was an incredible investor in the women’s game and someone who will be remembered by his players, his staff, and his colleagues for the amazing character that he was. Matt will leave a huge void in the women’s game. He was one of a kind, and his loss will be felt by all.”View image in fullscreenA picture in remembrance of Matt Beard on the screen at Villa Park, where Liverpool were due to play Aston  Villa.Photograph: Jess Hornby/WSL/WSL Football/Getty ImagesWorking in women’s football, if you are arranging to meet someone for a catch-up, you usually find that the vast majority of people in the sport want to have a coffee. Not Beard. “When are we going to get a pint?” he would often ask.Personally, when remembering Beardy, I will recall an early morning scene at Melwood of him tucking into a cooked breakfast, after he had said good morning to everybody in the building, and his subsequent words in an interview later that day: “Here, no one is above anyone. For me, it’s important that everyone feels valued, so I make a habit of saying good morning to everyone when I come in, just to make sure they know, whether they’re in the kitchen or the physio room or the ground staff. Your job is your job. Family comes first.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballLiverpool FC WomenChelsea WomenWest Ham United WomenWomen's Super LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Régis Le Bris’s side could easily have folded after the 33rd-minute dismissal of their left-back Reinildo Mandava for violent conduct and the rare second-half mistake from Robin Roefs that allowed Matty Cash to shoot Emery’s team ahead from 25 yards.Another Bournemouth blank for Eddie Howe as Newcastle are heldRead moreInstead, with the central defenders Nordi Mukiele and Omar Alderete outstanding, Le Bris’s 10 men simply regrouped before Wilson Isidor half-volleyed his third league goal of the season to strip the shine from the Villa manager’s weekend.With seconds remaining an increasingly agitated Emery was evidently so disgusted by the visitors’ passivity that he turned on his heel, briefly shook Le Bris by the hand and stormed down the tunnel.“We have to accept one point but this is not how we want to be as a team,” said Villa’s manager. “We need to get our identity back. We need to get confident again. I’m frustrated and disappointed. It should have been easier playing against 10 men but we’re not playing with the identity we’ve shown in the last three years. For me, it’s not enough.”Emery added: “We were lazy sometimes in defence. For example, when we conceded we were lazy.”Le Bris seemed somewhat more content. “It was a good draw,” he said after his promoted side’s eighth point in five games. “We started really well. Then came the red card but we reacted very well. We made a new gameplan, the team did really well in a deep block and it became a set piece game. I really liked our reaction to Villa’s goal, it would have been easy to give up but we showed we wanted to suffer together. The value of this point is really important.”With 11 men it could easily have been three points, especially as Chris Rigg had shimmered in midfield on his first Premier League start. Poor Rigg was sacrificed as Le Bris sent on an extra defender and switched to a back five after Reinildo’s exit, but there is surely much more to come from the talented 18-year-old.With Rigg still on the pitch it had taken some fine defending on Ezri Konsa’s part to deny Isidor as the striker repeatedly threatened Emiliano Martínez’s goal.Morgan Rogers remained worryingly isolated and seemingly unable to link Villa’s attacking play, and Roefs was left largely untested throughout a first half dominated by the moment when Cash slid in to drag Reinildo down and then, inadvertently, fell on top of the former Atlético Madrid defender. Reinildo, the first player from Mozambique to appear in England’s top tier, took so much exception to this that he flicked out his right leg and raked the inside of the right-back’s thigh with his studs.View image in fullscreenReinildo Mandava’s reaction to a push from Matty Cash earned him a red card.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAAn early exit ensued, prompting a home reshuffle featuring Rigg’s withdrawal and Dan Ballard’s introduction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alderete, a Paraguay defender, very nearly reminded him how to score but directed a header against the underside of the bar.Suitably encouraged, Sunderland forced a series of corners and throws – Mukiele takes a seriously mean long throw – as Villa could easily have been mistaken for the team at a numerical disadvantage. Tellingly, Emery’s increasingly agitated touchline gesticulations frequently appeared infinitely more dynamic and urgent than his players’ often strangely passive passing and movement.The moment in the 67th minute when Cash tried his luck from 25 yards and watched his hard, viciously swerving shot misread by Roefs promised to be a turning point, but it would ultimately prove a false dawn.Sunderland’s Netherlands Under-21 goalkeeper looked quietly furious with himself after his attempt at a punch merely left his fingertips grazed by Cash’s strike. Creditably, his teammates refused to fold and the intelligence of Granit Xhaka and Enzo Le Fée in a necessarily narrow midfield continued to drive Sunderland forward.When the former directed the subtlest of cushioned headers over Emery’s backline, Isidor’s low, scoring shot left Martínez helpless and his manager incandescent.The late moment when Watkins failed to make any sort of contact with the most inviting of balls into the box from the substitute Jadon Sancho seemed a microcosm of his team’s enduring travails.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueSunderlandAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Gallagher was quickest to react after Román parried Marcos Llorente’s low effort across goal, slotting home to give the visitors the lead. But their celebrations proved short-lived.

He is an aerial presence, an effective linker of the play and a proven finisher. But he is not Alexander Isak. Newcastle’s struggles in front of goal continued againstBournemouthin a third successive away goalless draw in the league and Eddie Howe admitted it would take time for his team to adapt to their new striker.“It’s a really strange occurrence, three 0-0s away from home for us,” Howe said. “We’re going to be a different team attacking-wise this year without Alex. I think that’s not why we haven’t scored in three away games but we’ll be attacking with a different emphasis. We’re evolving into a different team, hopefully a better team. That’s the plan. But it may take a bit of time.”Emery wants Aston Villa’s ‘identity back’ after Isidor earns point for 10-man SunderlandRead moreThe threat posed by Woltemade, Newcastle’s record signing who scored on his debut against Wolves, was largely nullified by Andoni Iraola’s side but the tall Germany striker made himself a nuisance. The travelling supporters were up in arms when, after touching down Tino Livramento’s cross, the tall Germany striker appeared to have his shirt tugged by Bafodé Diakité in the penalty area but the referee, Robert Jones, was not convinced.“My gut instinct was that it was a penalty,” Howe said. “I was adamant that it was. The fact that he was tugged and it stopped him from getting a shot off … for me, it was a clear penalty.”Howe made seven changes to the team that startedthe Champions League defeat to Barcelonaon Thursday as he tries to manage his priorities between four competitions. Bruno Guimarães, who had made 68 consecutive starts for Newcastle in the Premier League until this game, was an unused substitute.“We can’t look at it as a starting XI,” Howe said of his squad rotation. “If you look at our schedule, it’s relentless. We’re playing every midweek up until Christmas, so it’s going to be the squad that carries us to success, not 11 players.”Against a Bournemouth side who came into this off the back of three league wins and in the Champions League places, Howe deployed a back five that sat stubbornly in their own third to begin with. Iraola, ever flexible, kept the visitors guessing, switching his wingers more than once in the opening exchanges.View image in fullscreenEddie Howe and the players applaud the fans at full time.Photograph: Adam Davy/PATyler Adams, set up by David Brooks’s back‑heel from the right, drew the first save from Nick Pope. Brooks, this time coming in from the left, was then found by Evanilson’s cutback and finished coolly, only to be offside. Jacob Murphy, a second-half substitute against Barcelona, was Newcastle’s biggest threat. He had their best chance in the first half when he combined with Woltemade and Sandro Tonali before his shot was saved by Djordje Petrovic.It was perhaps no surprise that, by the time the half-time whistle went, there was a feeling both teams were cancelling each other out. Howe studied Iraola’s Rayo Vallecano during his sabbatical after leaving Bournemouth; the two coaches are known to occasionally exchange text messages and take leaves out of each other’s tactics books.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was Iraola, however, who was the more agitated on the touchline. He had thrown on Justin Kluivert,the scorer of a hat-trickin this fixture at St James’ Park last season, in the hope of a goal threat. The Spaniard was particularly aggrieved when Newcastle’s Malick Thiaw, who had just received a yellow card for handball, escaped another moments later for a cynical foul on Ryan Christie. Thiaw was withdrawn a couple of minutes later.“I think it’s a second yellow. It’s quite clear,” Iraola said. “They subbed him straight away – they took him out the next minute, at the first chance they had.”After dummying the free-kick that came from Thiaw’s foul, Kluivert was not going to pass up the opportunity to have a strike at goal when Bournemouth were awarded one in shooting range in stoppage time. The Dutchman’s powerful but low effort was batted away by Pope to preserve a point for Newcastle that leaves them in 13th. After Barcelona and Bournemouth, it is Bradford up next for Howe’s side as they begin the defence of their Carabao Cup title. The changes will surely be rung again.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBournemouthNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Manchester United and Arsenal’s supporters then spontaneously applauded on 47 minutes, with the travelling Arsenal fans displaying the words “We love you Beardy” on handheld signs, and after the game, both managers’ thoughts were clearly primarily with Beard’s loved ones.“Beardy is an incredible human. He has and will continue to leave a legacy in our game,” the Manchester United manager Skinner said. “It’s a very sad day but there’s some solace in knowing that his memory will always live on. He was a larger-than-life character. I think you live on in people’s memories – I know that I’ll keep his legacy alive by talking about him all the time.”Goodbye Matt Beard: the Del Boy of women’s football who took Liverpool to two WSL titlesRead moreWhile neither of these two teams were on the long list of WSL sides that Beard managed across his successful career, his influence on the game was so far-reaching that players and staff at both clubs knew him well, not least the new United assistant coach, Scott Rogers, who previously worked on Beard’s backroom team at Liverpool. United’s new goalkeeper coach, Joe Potts, was Liverpool’s goalkeeping coach under Beard, too. They were both visibly emotional during the minute’s silence.Similarly, Arsenal’s summer signings from Liverpool, Olivia Smith – who started the game – and the substitute Taylor Hinds, had everybody’s respect for their professionalism in such challenging circumstances. Liverpool’s match at Aston Villa, scheduled for midday on Sunday, was postponed.The Arsenal head coach Slegers praised both players’ professionalism in the circumstances, saying: “We gave them the option to choose what they wanted to do today. It’s very hard, and we’re all very sad. They both said Matt would have wanted them to play. And they went out and did it, and there was a lot of emotion I think [in] the one-minute silence moment. It was really hard for them but it shows a lot of strength from them.”It was the talented Smith, who transferred to Arsenal for £1m and had played under Beard at Liverpool before he left the Merseyside club in February, who went closest to opening the scoring in the first half, when her powerfullystruck effort from the edge of the penalty area was touched on to the crossbar by Phallon Tullis-Joyce.View image in fullscreenManchester United’s Ella Toone shoots wide from distance.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAThat aside, Arsenal’s Daphne van Domselaar was the busier of the two goalkeepers in the first half, saving well from Melvine Malard with fewer than 60 seconds on the clock and later doing well to block a low Jess Park strike after initially fumbling a cross.The hosts were giving the European champions a tough test, with Park once again showing lots of silky skill as she continues to endear herself to the United fans after her deadline-day switch from Manchester City.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The substitute Chloe Kelly was presented with a golden chance inside the penalty area but could not quite connect with her strike.At the back for Arsenal, their 18-year-old centre-back Katie Reid produced another solid performance, as she continues to deputise for the injured Leah Williamson, and Slegers will have been delighted by the teenager’s calm handling of the threats posed first by Malard and then substitute Elisabeth Terland, who had scored a hat-trick on this ground three days earlier.Manchester United’s Ella Toone drove a bouncing effort wide in stoppage time but in the end both teams had to settle for a clean sheet. The game felt very much overshadowed by the weekend’s news, however, and Slegers added of Beard: “I felt his warmth as a person.“It’s such sad news, everyone was really shocked, and I feel very, very sorry for his closest family and his loved ones.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester United WomenArsenal WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Even the most pessimistic of Blades supporters would have anticipated that the return of United’s favourite son for a third stint in the dugout would have provided even the most fractional of lifts, enough to at least pick up a first point of the season against a Charlton side without a win since the opening day.Saturday lunchtime in S2 was fizzling with excitement and anticipation, despite the miserable weather that engulfed Bramall Lane. There were Chris Wilder scarves on sale outside, the Blades had announced tickets were selling at a rate of knots and it all seemed to point to one outcome. The problem is, nobody told Nathan Jones and his Charlton side – or, it seems, the home players.View image in fullscreenThe Blades fans welcome back Chris Wilder with a banner honouring him.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersOlaofe’s goal may have come late but even if the Blades had escaped with a draw it was difficult to argue there was a lift in mood and the fabled new manager bounce, which felt like it would be an inevitability as a giant banner was unfurled pre-match depicting Wilder and his unparalleled passion for his boyhood club.As the rain hammered down on the returning manager’s slumped shoulders, the mood gradually descended as dark as the early-autumn Sheffield skies over the course of another miserable afternoon. You could sense the tension throughout, with the desperation to end their worst start to a season in 30 years almost palpable on occasions.We may only still be in September, but the omens are not good, Olaofe’s goal consigning the Blades to a sixth successive defeat from the start the season. Only threeChampionshipsides since 2004 have started a season with six defeats in a row and two of them were relegated.Forget talk of promotion right now, after the heartbreakof May’s playoff final, in the wake of which Wilder lost his job. When you have scored one goal in six league games, that talk must be paused. This is now a discussion about whether Wilder,brought backafterRubén Sellés’s dismal start, can resurrect a team that have fallen from the verge of the Premier League to being bereft of confidence in four months.View image in fullscreenCharlton’s Isaac Olaofe scores the only goal of the game in added time.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA“It’s not the homecoming everyone expected,” Wilder said. “Maybe I’ve underestimated the amount of work we need to do. There’s a bit of fragility around us and I shouldn’t have underestimated the effect of the last five or six games. It was chaos really, and I have to find a way through that chaos.”The brutal reality is that the Blades weren’t even close to coming out on top. But the biggest worry is that the determination, grit and attitude Wilder’s sides are famous for – and which played such a role in their success – were badly lacking. What had started with a ferocious roar as Wilder emerged from the tunnel became worryingly subdued quite quickly.Given the appalling conditions and the difficult start both sides have made, it always felt as if it would be a game of few chances. A bright start from United quickly faded and neither team were able to craft too many clear-cut openings all afternoon. As Wilder alluded to, in the critical moments his side panicked, perhaps out of sheer desperation to find a first win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

James Bree’s composure in squaring the ball for Olaofe to stroke home brought with it not so much a sense of frustration from the home supporters, but one of exasperation for a moment they sensed was coming given their travails. Wilder could do nothing but stand and watch.View image in fullscreenSheffield United players look dejected after the final whistle signals their sixth straight defeat.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersThe only noise from the home fans at full-time were boos, something Wilder is not too accustomed to, having been rightfully worshipped by the supporters he calls his own. The Charlton fans, revelling in their second win of the season, were the ones making the noise and jokingly telling Wilder he was going to be sacked in the morning.There is still a long way to go, but it is clear the notion of Wilder’s mere presence and his passion for this club are not going to be enough to drag the Blades out of this current strife.Explore more on these topicsSheffield UnitedCharlton AthleticChampionshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I don’t really care how people look at it.”He suffered in qualifying with a scruffy lap that included brushing the wall, while his team put him out too early with the track grip still evolving, and maintained that with overtaking hard in Baku, his race chances had been scuppered on Saturday.“Of course I wanted more, so it was not a good result,” Norris said. “I couldn’t do anything more. It was lost yesterday. It’s just impossible to overtake. So I look back to yesterday more than anything today.”During the race Norris became embroiled in a series of DRS trains from which he could not escape, compounded by a slow pit stop fromMcLaren– the team’s second for Norris in two races – without which he might have made up at least two more places. He felt he had exacted all he could in difficult circumstances. “I could have ended up in the wall and gone long and something worse happened.

Beard, who had two spells in charge of Liverpool, left the club in February.Beard won back-to-back WSL titles with the Reds in 2013 and 2014 during his first spell and rejoined the club in 2021 after stints with Boston Breakers in the US, West Ham and Bristol City. He guided Liverpool to promotion back to the WSL in his first season back at the helm and remained in charge until February.Liverpool’s WSL match postponed after Matt Beard’s death, Premier League buildup and more – matchday liveRead moreThe club announced the death of the 47-year-old late on Saturday in a statement and confirmed on Sunday morning that their match against Aston Villa would not go ahead.Liverpool posted on X: “Liverpool’s Barclays Women’s Super League fixture against Aston Villa today has been postponed. Following the sudden and tragic news of the passing of former LFC Women manager Matt Beard, the match at Villa Park – scheduled for noon BST – will not take place. Details of a rearrangement will be confirmed in due course.”After leaving Liverpool, Beard was announced as Burnley manager in June but resigned in August. The Clarets earlier confirmed their Northern Premier Division match against West Brom, which was scheduled for Sunday, had been postponed after the news of Beard’s death.Richard Bevan, the League Managers Association chief executive, paid tribute to Beard: “Matt was a true champion of women’s football and dedicated his early career to advancing the game on its path to professionalisation. He played an integral role in the development of players, coaches, and the wider game as one of the most active managers in women’s football over the past 15 years, achieving success at some of the biggest clubs in the game.”View image in fullscreenA picture in remembrance of Matt Beard on the big screen at Villa Park.

He was a caring and loving person who always made time for people. Matt was integral to the growth of the women’s game in this country and is a man who will be sadly missed by everyone in the footballing community.”Hayes, who took over from Beard in 2012, said in a statement to the LMA: “He was always smiling. Matt will leave a huge void in the women’s game. He was one of a kind, and his loss will be felt by all. My heart goes out to his family, but I want to take the time to acknowledge what a special man he really was.”Manchester United described Beard as a “giant” of the women’s game, posting: “Matt was a fierce opponent of ours; a giant of women’s football.”View image in fullscreenChelsea’s Aggie Beever-Jones scores the only goal of their game against Leicester.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersThere was a minute’s silence before the WSL games that went ahead.

A broken thumb denied him a Test debut against New Zealand last winter; an abdominal injury forced him out of the squad to face Zimbabwe at the start of this summer. And after England bowled first in the final T20 international against Ireland, he jarred a knee while taking a catch in the deep, forcing him off the field and bringing into question what role he would play in the chase.But a grimacing knock was also a breakthrough: Cox struck a 35-ball 55, his first international half-century, in a chase of 155, securing England a comfy six-wicket victory and a 2-0 series win. Having entered at 33 for two, the 24-year-old – who was not originally included in the touring party – was tested in an experimental middle order and reeled off the strokes that made him the leading run-scorer in this year’s Hundred. Tom Banton showed calm, too, putting on 49 with Cox and remaining unbeaten on 37.“I seem to do well in an Oval [Invincibles] shirt,” said Cox. “So I was like: ‘Come on, this is just franchise cricket and I’m playing for the Oval, so just enjoy it and have a bit of fun.’ To get in this team is pretty tough. There wasn’t a chance I wasn’t going to bat because I might have to wait another two years.”Ireland v England: third men’s T20 cricket international – liveRead moreRain got in the way of the second T20, and while winter jackets were still required, Malahide found some sun in the early afternoon. England made two changes: in came Cox and Sonny Baker, who made his second white-ball bow this month. The first had been ruined by Aiden Markram’s bat as Baker conceded 76 from his seven overs on his one-day ­international debut.Ross Adair’s record is some way off Markram’s, but the 31-year-old’s quirky method – the backlift set up for cross-bat bludgeons – enjoyed Baker’s opening spell. The quick’s second over went for 16 as Adair lofted the ball over the off-side ring.Spin brought England joy. Liam Dawson took two deliveries to find Paul Stirling’s edge, while Rehan Ahmed had Adair sweeping to deep midwicket, gone for 33 off 23. Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker ­combined for 123 in the opening T20 but there was less stability in the middle order this time round. Jamie ­Overton prompted a couple of miscues, while Ireland failed to decode Adil Rashid’s googly.View image in fullscreenJos Buttler catches out Ireland’s Paul Stirling during the T20.Photograph: Brian Lawless/PAThe game, however, refused to go Baker’s way: Gareth Delany picked a slower ball to drive through the ­covers for four and back-to-back sixes behind square leg followed, the seamer’s threat reduced whenever he dropped short. He finished with figures of none for 52 from four overs. Brighter days will hopefully follow but the shift from domestic cricket has been brutal.Passing showers delayed the restart before Jos Buttler fell for none to a ludicrous catch by Curtis ­Campher at short cover, flying low to his right for the one-hander. Cox, who hurt himself at deep backward square when holding on for Rashid’s third wicket, settled quickly after Jacob Bethell departed at the start of the fifth over. He swung hard over the leg side and moved to 22 off just eight deliveries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I haven’t played since the Hundred final, resting my rib for four weeks, but I also had a bit of a sore knee then. I’m not going to let down the opportunity to play for your country because I’ve got a sore knee.”Phil Salt swapped his usual hyper-aggression for a more measured approach at the other end, and while he edged behind off Campher for a 23-ball 29, England’s required rate was below six as they entered the final 10 overs. Cox eventually ­succumbed to Ben White’s legspin, but he had already decided the game’s direction.Explore more on these topicsCricketIreland Cricket TeamEngland cricket teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Two late throws flipped the placings and shunted Australia’s Matt Denny off the podium, as Sweden’s Daniel Ståhl – who had been dancing under an umbrella at the start of the evening – claimed the gold medal with a throw of 70.47m.Denny described the conditions as the worst in which he has competed, and later he shed tears in a moment with his wife in the stands, dismayed and frustrated at how the competition played out. “It was just really hard, really emotional and disappointing,” said theParis bronze medallist, who slipped and fell during the competition.“I didn’t get a concussion, I didn’t break any bones and I didn’t tear anything, so I’m good for next season so that’s the main thing, and that was the first thing that my wife said to me.”The high jump was also affected the stormy weather, and forced Olyslagers into a long wait after her 2m clearance. “Even if [I was] waiting and out there in the rain, I have such a joy because I know these moments are forever,” she said. “The gold medal was the added bonus, but being out there and enjoying it, I’ll never forget what I just experienced.”Havingwon the world indoorand Diamond League titles already in 2025, Olyslagers entered the competition as favourite and quickly moved to 2m without a miss, as the rain and wet mat made jumping difficult. Only Żodzik was able to challenge her after the second rain delay with her own clearance of 2m, but neither was successful at 2.02m.Olyslagers’s countrywoman Eleanor Patterson finished fifth, having cleared 197cm, the same as the joint bronze medallists Yaroslava Mahuchikh and Angelina Topic, but the Australian found herself off the podium on a countback.View image in fullscreenMatt Denny finished fourth in a discus final hit by bad weather in Tokyo.Photograph: Ashley Landis/APOlyslagers said her medal was the result of her preparation, and throughout the evening she leaned on her strong Christian faith. “Of course the raindrops started sideways underneath our towels and then we had to go [under cover], but again, I was just spending time with Jesus out there and I was like, I could be here for hours, the stadium can shut down, I’m in my happy place right now.”Earlier, Jess Hull was within two tenths of another national record in the 800m final but finished eighth behind the Kenyan winner Lilian Odira, unable to make up ground on a pack that started swiftly. She was happy to repeat a similar time from the semi-final on Friday and was in awe of her rivals in her first taste of a major global final in the two-lapper.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was Australia’s second best result in the event at a world championships meeting, after Craig Mottram’s bronze in 2005. “Instantly, over the line, it’s just sheer joy, sheer happiness,” Robinson said. “A minute later, the ‘what ifs’ start kicking in, and it’s like: ‘Man, I’m one spot off a medal, what if I found a little bit more?’ But that’s hindsight. I feel like in the race I was giving my all a kilometre in, and I was just hoping that I could hang on for as long as possible.”The Australian men’s 4x100m group failed to finish after a botched change between Calab Law and Rohan Browning, heaping more misery on the relay program. In the heats on Saturday the men’s 4x400m team were disqualified for a changeover area breach and the women’s 4x100m dropped the baton.The Tokyo world championships end with Australia 15th on the medal tally with one gold and three bronze.

It also contained allegations of sexual harassment denied by the company. It states she was fired for “poor performance and toxic behaviour”.However, the former diplomat was barred from publicising the memoir after Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, secured a ruling preventing her from doing so. She subsequently appeared before a US Senate judiciary subcommittee, in which she said Meta worked “hand in glove” with Beijing over censorship tools – something the company has denied.Pan Macmillan, which published the memoir, said it had sold more than 150,000 copies across all formats. The book was also named in The Sunday Times‘ bestselling hardbacks of 2025 so far. The paperback edition is due to be published early next year.New York magazine has previously reported that Wynn-Williams was paid an advance for the book of more than $500,000 (£370,000).Haigh highlighted Wynn-Williams’s case in the House of Commons during a debate about employment rights on Monday. She said Wynn-Williams’s decision to speak out had plunged her into financial peril.“Despite previous public statements that Meta no longer uses NDAs [non-disclosure agreements] in cases of sexual harassment – which Sarah has repeatedly alleged – she is being pushed to financial ruin through the arbitration system in the UK, as Meta seeks to silence and punish her for speaking out,” she said.“Meta has served a gagging order on Sarah and is attempting to fine her $50,000 for every breach of that order. She is on the verge of bankruptcy. I am sure that the whole house and the government will stand with Sarah as we pass this legislation to ensure that whistleblowers and those with the moral courage to speak out are always protected.”It is understood that the $50,000 figure represents the damages Wynn-Williams has to pay for material breaches of the separation agreement she signed when she left Meta in 2017. Meta has emphasised that Wynn-Williams entered into the non-disparagement agreement voluntarily as part of her departure.Meta said that to date, Wynn-Williams had not been forced to make any payments under the agreement.The company did not wish to comment on Haigh’s intervention. It has previously said that Wynn-Williams’s Senate testimony was “divorced from reality and riddled with false claims” about China and the company’s treatment of teenagers.Meta has described the book as a “mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives”. It has said she was fired for “poor performance and toxic behaviour” and that an investigation concluded she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment.It said the ruling preventing her from publicising the memoir confirmed the “false and defamatory book should never have been published”.The ruling stated Wynn-Williams should stop promoting the book and, to the extent she could, stop further publication. It did not order any action by Pan Macmillan.Wynn-Williams has not spoken in public since appearing at the Senate hearing in April. In a written statement this month, she said she was grateful that the US Senate was continuing to investigate Meta’s behaviour.“I wish I could say more,” she said. “I urge other tech employees and those who are thinking of whistleblowing to share what they know before more children are harmed.”Her lawyer confirmed Wynn-Williams “remains silenced about the very matters Congress is investigating, despite clear and unanimous voices from Congress calling on Meta to end their arbitration proceedings which threaten to bankrupt her”.Explore more on these topicsMetaFacebookSocial networkingnewsShareReuse this content"

But more needs to be done, and faster,” said the IWF’s chief executive, Kerry Smith.The child protection charity the NSPCC also called for guidelines. “Tech companies must introduce robust measures to ensure children’s safety is not neglected and government must implement a statutory duty of care to children for AI developers,” said the NSPCC’s chief executive, Chris Sherwood.A user-created chatbot falls within scope of the UK’sOnline Safety Act, under which sites can be punished with multimillion-pound fines or, in extreme cases, blocked. The IWF said the sexual abuse chatbots were developed by users and the website’s creators.Ofcom, the UK watchdog charged with implementing the act, said: “The fight against child sexual exploitation and abuse is a top priority for Ofcom, and online service providers who fail to introduce the necessary protections should expect to face enforcement action.”The IWF has reported a marked increase in reports of AI-generated abuse material in the first six months of this year, up 400% on the same period last year, withvideo content surgingdue to improvements in the technology behind the images.The chatbot content is accessible in the UK but has been reported to the IWF’s US counterpart, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, because it is hosted on US servers. When contacted by the Guardian, NCMEC said any report made to its cyber tipline was referred to law enforcement. The IWF said the site appeared to be owned by a China-based company.Scenarios offered by the chatbots, the IWF said, included an eight-year-old girl trapped in an adult’s basement and a preteen homeless girl being invited into a stranger’s house. In these scenarios, the chatbot played the role of the girl and the user played the adult.IWF analysts said the explicit chatbots were accessed via a link within an advert for the site on social media – and took users to a section of the site containing illegal material. Other sections of the site offered non-sexual and sexual, but legal, chatbots and scenarios.One chatbot that displayed a CSAM image was asked by analysts about its character and it confirmed it was designed to mimic the behaviour of a preteen, according to the IWF. Other chatbots that did not display CSAM nonetheless referred to not wearing clothes and having no inhibitions, when asked by analysts.The IWF said the site had received tens of thousands of visits, including 60,000 in July.A UK government spokesperson said: “UK law is crystal clear – creating, possessing or distributing child sexual abuse images, including those that are AI generated, is illegal … We recognise there’s more to do. The government will use all the tools at its disposal to continue to tackle this horrendous crime.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Child protectionChildrenInternet safetyComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

If your measures are not good enough yet, put that on your risk assessment.”Delegates, some drinking free champagne provided by conference sponsors, asked anxious questions. What if a company could not afford to install age verification? How big would the fines be? Could sites avoid having to comply by blocking UK traffic? WasOfcomaware that rival site owners might be trying to sabotage competitors’ businesses by tipping off the regulator about non-compliance?View image in fullscreenA presentation by Ofcom at the Wyndham Diplomat hotel in Prague, Czech Republic.Photograph: Photographer: Bjoern Steinz/Björn Steinz/Panos Pictures“We exist to help you,” another Ofcom regulator said to the audience of about 50 men and seven women. “It’s hard. There are many, many things you need to know, but we exist to help members of the adult industry with compliance.”Seven weeks since the introduction of the Online Safety Act, Ofcom’s regulators want to tell a positive story about the pornography industry’s response to the legislation. All of the top 10 and most of the top 100 adult sites have either introduced age checks or blocked UK access, they said; social media sites that allow pornographic content, such as X and Reddit, have also deployed age assurance. There were 7.5m visits to the top five age verification sites in August, up from 1m in June.The regulators like to cast the 27 July introduction of age verification as the industry’s seatbelt moment, referring to it as AV Day, a moment that would decisively shut off children’s access to pornography in the UK. The reality has been more complicated.View image in fullscreenAn Ofcom screen at the Prague conference.Photograph: Photographer: Bjoern Steinz/Björn Steinz/Panos PicturesIn the days after the legislation was launched, there was an immediate sharp spike in the number of downloads of VPNs, which allow users to mask their geographical location, and circumvent age verification requests.“The rollout has been fairly disastrous,” Mike Stabile, the director of public policy from the Free Speech Coalition, which represents the adult entertainment in the US, said. He said that traffic had moved from compliant to non-compliant sites. “VPNs have surged; people have not been compliant; we’re seeing traffic go to pirate sites … I don’t think Ofcom would look at this and say: ‘This is what we wanted.’”Corey Silverstein, an American lawyer who represents a number of adult industry companies and who has unsuccessfully challenged the introduction of age verification legislation in several US states, said there was considerable hostility to the regulators. “People are very professional and very polite, but this isn’t the friendliest audience. Some people steer very clear of them. You can see it must be uncomfortable for them walking into a trade show like this.”But he gave a presentation advising pornography site owners that they would have to swallow their animosity toward the regulators and work with Ofcom to implement the new regulations.“Their goal is not to cut your legs off. They smile and they’re very nice. They’re not trying to kill you,” he said. “My understanding is they’re actually not even looking to financially fine you. They just want to push you in the right direction for compliance.”The Ofcom officials, wearing smartly ironed white shirts, worked steadily against a background noise of steels drums, handing out questionnaires printed on A4 paper, as a troupe of dancers in feathered leotards performed for delegates, and sponsors handed out cocktails.The form (on paper to allow sites the protection of anonymity) asked delegates to state whether they had adopted age verification in the UK and asked companies that were not yet compliant, to explain why they had done nothing. By Saturday evening, one Ofcom official said not too many delegates had agreed to fill in the forms, but they were hopeful that Sunday might see more responses.No site has yet been fined under the Online Safety Act, but Ofcom has opened 12 investigations into pornographic services, covering more than 60 sites and apps.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionNews of these investigations has prompted some unease among owners of pornography sites, who are also contending with tightened regulation in the US and France. But there was some grudging acknowledgment of Ofcom’s willingness to attend industry events and speak to people.“In the US, people really don’t want to talk to us,” Alex Kekesi, Pornhub’s vice-president of brand and community, said. “We appreciate that Ofcom has invited us to have a seat at the table. We’re often not included in conversations that have to do with regulating our industry.”In advance of 27 July, Ofcom established a Porn Portfolio team, made up of six compliance officers, working on persuading companies to adhere to the rules. Members of this team (who asked for their names and images not to be released for safeguarding reasons) have attended similar conferences in Berlin, Amsterdam and LA. A separate enforcement team of more than 40 staff members works on investigating those organisations that fail to comply.“We are very conscious of the size of the sector and the ease with which anybody can set up a service that shares pornographic content,” one of the regulators said. “We’re not saying that we are going to manage to get every single service into compliance. The approach we take is targeting our resources on those areas where the most children are at most risk of harm.” Penalties, when they are imposed, will be designed to have a deterrent effect; sites can be find up to £18m or 10% of global worldwide revenue.“Companies can choose to not comply and take the risk that we will come after them and find them. We want enforcement to change that balance of incentives, so they think it’s just not worth taking the risk,” the Ofcom official said.Another Ofcom employee rejected the argument that soaring VPN downloads meant the legislation had failed, arguing that the legislation was primarily aimed at preventing children from accidentally stumbling over pornographic material (rather than preventing those who were deliberating seeking out pornography from finding it).As well as contending with new age verification requirements, pornography site owners were also grappling with how to moderate AI-generated content, to ensure users aren’t allowed to create the kind of violent and illegal material that would attract Ofcom’s attention and trigger companies like Visa and Mastercard to stop processing their payments. Sites and apps that offer AI-generated pornography are also regulated by the act.“From a compliance perspective, how can you tell the difference between a 15-year-old AI model and an 18- or 19-year-old AI model?” one delegate asked, uncertain about how to prevent users from encouraging AI to create illegal child sexual abuse material.Steve Jones, who runs an AI porn site, said they had to train their AI systems to understand what was unacceptable. “We say your creation has to be at least 5ft tall, can’t be completely flat-chested and we ban things like pigtails and braces and all the childish toys and teddy bears and things like that,” he said. “AI doesn’t understand the difference between an adult woman that looks young and a young girl. We have to teach it. The AI itself has no morals and no ethics.”Explore more on these topicsPornographyOfcomInternet safetyChild protectionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

ItsSupersonic hair dryerwas followed by the Airwrap multi-styler, a revolution in hair styling that uses air rather than direct heat to curl hair – and regularly sells out in stores worldwide despite its high price.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There have been two updates to the Airwrap since – a 2022 upgrade and the app-drivenAirwrap id, which launched last year with variants for both curly and straight hair. This summer’s Co-anda 2x is a completely re-tooled product, with a more powerful motor for faster styling, and new attachments, including an air-powered straightener. I tested the new model to find out if it could really be worth £580.View Straight + Wavy at John LewisView Diffuser version at DysonHow I testedView image in fullscreen‘I compared the speed of styling and the overall finish with my older Airwrap id.’Photograph: Lisa Smith/The GuardianI tested the Airwrap Co-anda 2x right after washing my medium-length curly hair, using the drying attachment to rough-dry my hair before testing each brush attachment, the straightener and the curling wands. I styled my hair before heading out to work to see how long the finished style would last during a day of typical wear.When testing, I was looking for overall ease of use (how intuitive the Airwrap and its individual attachments are to use); the effectiveness of each attachment in drying, straightening and creating curls; how well each of my styles lasted throughout the day; and the look and feel of my hair after styling.I tested the Co-anda 2x both with the MyDyson app and without it. On different days, I tried a simple, relaxed daytime style and a more defined party look. Finally, I compared the speed of styling and the overall finish of the curls with my older Airwrap id.Dyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x: what you need to knowView image in fullscreenThe Co-anda 2x Straight + Wavy comes with six attachments.Photograph: Lisa Smith/The GuardianView Straight + Wavy at John LewisView Diffuser version at DysonThe Co-anda 2x is the latest in Dyson’s range of multi-stylers, all of which use heated air rather than direct heat to style hair, as mentioned above. This has two key advantages: styling the hair with air means less risk of scorching, dehydrating or damaging it compared with heated curling tongs and wands; and with an air-powered multi-styler, you can style hair from damp rather than having to dry your hair first – a godsend for busy mornings.As with previous Airwraps, the big selling point here is the curling attachments, which use the phenomenon known as the Coandă effect to create a vortex that attracts your hair, causing it to wrap around the barrel in an impressively foolproof way. The same effect can be found in other products, such asShark’s FlexStyleandFlexFusionmulti-stylers (as well as less glamorous things such as aircraft wings). When you get the knack of it, styling with the Co-anda is almost completely effortless and about as close to magic as hairstyling gets.Like Dyson’s Airwrap id, the Co-anda 2x comes in two colours and two different variants – one with tools and attachments forstraight and wavy hair, and one with attachments forcurly and coily hair. I tested the Straight + Wavy version in ceramic pink, which comes with six attachments: a drying attachment, two curling barrels in different sizes, two styling brushes, and a new plate-free air straightening attachment.The Co-anda 2x can be controlled from your phone via the MyDyson app. You can choose from three different heat and speed settings manually on the handle or in the app, and the temperature settings can also be fine-tuned from the app to give you a slightly cooler “high heat” setting, for instance. There’s also a separate “cool shot” button to finish and set your style.Dyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x specificationsPower:1,300WMotor speed:150,000 RPMTemperature settings:three (adjustable using the MyDyson app), plus a “cold shot”Speed settings:threeAttachments:Straight + Wavy version: drying attachment, two curling barrels, volumising brush, smoothing brush and Airsmooth 2x straightening attachment; Diffuser version: drying attachment, diffuser, wide-toothed tension comb, volumising brush, smoothing brush and one 40mm curling barrelWeight:410g (main unit with curling barrel); 716g including cable and power adaptorDyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x: what we loveView image in fullscreen‘My daytime style and party-glam look both lasted a full day without dropping.’Photograph: Lisa Smith/The GuardianIf you’ve ever tried a Dyson Airwrap, you’ll know there’s something mildly thrilling about watching your hair twist itself around the barrel and pop out seconds later in a perfect ringlet. The curl id program in the MyDyson app takes all the guesswork out of curling by sending the best wrapping, drying and cooling times for your hair type directly to the device, which changes settings automatically so you never have to press a button if you don’t want to.You can also change the direction of the airflow to the Airwrap’s curlers at the flick of a switch – a neat trick that no other multi-styler currently offers. On rival multi-stylers such as Shark’s, it’s a bit of a pain to have to switch between the attachments every time you want to change curl direction – especially if you’re alternating the direction of the ringlets for a less uniform, more natural look. This is much less faff.I found the app easy to set up and pleasingly foolproof in use – you can adjust the suggested timings to your preference, for example, to style or cool for a little longer and help set your hair in place. Of course, you can also operate the styler manually, if you prefer. The new handle design with soft-touch buttons is comfortable to hold, and the heat and airflow settings are easy to check and adjust while you’re styling; I found it handy to be able to drop the heat or speed setting for finer sections of hair around my face, for example.The styling attachments twist easily on to and off the base unit, and contain RFID chips that automatically set the recommended airspeed and heat settings for each attachment. I found these suggested smart settings worked well for my medium-thick, medium-length hair and generally used them as they came. However, as with the suggested timings in the app, you can adjust these manually via the handle should you prefer. The Straight + Wavy version I tested includes two sizes of curling barrel, 30mm for more defined ringlets and 40mm for looser waves and curls. It’s worth noting, however, that the “with diffuser” variant for curly and coily hair includes only the 40mm barrel.The biggest upgrade is the Co-anda 2x’s new, more powerful motor, which spins at 150,000 RPM – 36% faster than the Airwrap id and faster even than theSupersonic hairdryer. This translates into noticeably faster styling times; I found it knocked about a third off styling times from freshly washed to dried and styled compared with the id. Indeed, the Co-anda 2x completed the initial rough-dry in just a couple of minutes and wrapped hair more efficiently around its curling barrels.Despite the beefed-up motor, the Co-anda 2x is also impressively lightweight; the main unit and 40mm curler weighed 410g on my kitchen scales. That’s not vastly dissimilar to the Airwrap id, but the Co-anda 2x definitely feels smaller and lighter when you hold them side by side. My hair felt soft and looked shiny and healthy after styling, drawing compliments from passing colleagues. Most importantly, both my daytime style and my party-glam look lasted a full day without dropping, outlasting the same styles created with the Airwrap id.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

That’s a bit of a blow, if you’ll excuse the pun, especially if you’ve invested in additional attachments for your previous models. There’s currently no equivalent to the Airwrap id’s conical barrel, a versatile attachment that I found I missed when using the Co-anda 2x.At £580, the Co-anda 2x is Dyson’s most expensive styling product to date and one of the most expensive beauty products on the market. This might feel like an investment too far if you’ve recently bought another Airwrap, particularly given that you won’t be able to use your old attachments.Despite following the instructions to the letter, I didn’t get on very well with the new straightening attachment, which, likeDyson’s Airstraitstand-alone straightener, uses air jets rather than hot plates to straighten your hair. The full-size Airstrait does a good job on my type 3 curly hair, but the smaller attachment on the Airwrap didn’t seem to grip my hair well enough to fully straighten it. It’s possible the attachment would work better on wavy hair rather than my full curls, but if you’re in the market for an air styler that also straightens, it’s worth keeping this in mind. An alternative option isShark’s FlexFusion styler(or even more recent update, theShark Glam), which includes a standard hotplate straightener alongside its air-powered curling attachments.Dyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x warranty and repairsView image in fullscreenHelpful maintenance tips can be found in the MyDyson app.Photograph: Lisa Smith/The GuardianThe MyDyson app has a section with useful maintenance tips to help keep your Co-anda in good working order, and guidance on everything from fixing connectivity issues to cleaning the filter, to hopefully get it going again if it stops working. If you’d rather talk to a person – or have reached the limit of the help the app can provide – Dyson also has a dedicatedhelpline, which is also how to book a repair under warranty if necessary.Like all of Dyson’s hair care products, the Co-anda 2x is covered by a two-year warranty under which Dyson will repair or replace your air styler if it stops working. Any spare parts and replacement accessories you buy for your Airwrap come with a one-year warranty. Book a repair and Dyson will arrange for a courier to collect your broken item.Repaired and refurbished items are also sold directly by Dyson – you can save money and do your bit for the environment by buying a refurbished machine fromDyson Renewed. There were no Co-anda 2x devices in the Dyson Renewed storefront at the time of writing, but other Airwraps were available.Third-party sites such asSell My Dysonare your best bet for turning your old Airwrap into cash; andRecycle Your Electricalswill help you recycle any non-repairable items.Should I buy the Dyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x?The Airwrap Co-anda 2x is an undeniably impressive styling tool – but let’s be clear: the price is very high. It costs £100 more than theAirwrap idand over £200 more than the closest non-Dyson equivalent,Shark’s 5-in-1 FlexFusion, all of which firmly positions it at the top end of the market.That said, if you style your hair frequently, the Co-anda 2x earns its premium. It’s faster, more versatile, and easier to use than anything else out there, including all previous Airwraps and Shark’s FlexStyle and FlexFusion multi-stylers. The combination of easy-to-use manual buttons and the stylist-in-your-pocket MyDyson app means it’s easy for even beginners to create different day and evening styles that last. It also leaves hair looking shiny and healthy – especially compared with hair styled with direct heat from traditional hot tools. Being able to style directly from damp hair is a godsend for busy mornings.Still, it’s worth acknowledging that upgrading from a recent Airwrap, especially the recent id model, isn’t the most sustainable choice – and is hard to justify from a monetary perspective too. Unless your current device is genuinely worn out, sticking with what you have will be the better option for both Mother Earth and your pocket.Ultimately, though, if you don’t already own an Airwrap (or you skipped the last update), the Co-anda 2x is Dyson’s best yet. It’s an expensive product, without question, but if you’re willing to pay a premium, it really does blow the competition away.View Straight + Wavy at John LewisView Diffuser version at DysonFor more, read the Filter’s guides tothe best hot brushesandthe best hair straightenersLise Smith is awriter with more than 15 years of experience covering beauty, lifestyle, parenting and the performing arts, and more than 40 years of living with rebellious curls.

But the aggressive action Trump seeks could dramatically backfireSun 21 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 21 Sep 2025 12.58 EDTShareDonald Trump has once again taken a wrecking ball to the rule of law and long-standing norms as he seeks to fire Lisa Cook, theFederal Reservegovernor, and pursue his unprecedented assault on the central bank’s independence. Just as he failed to understand the huge problems his tariffs would create, Trump fails to understand the serious damage his attacks on the Federal Reserve could cause.In April, Trumplaunched repeated attackson the Fed, threatening to fire its chairman, Jerome Powell, and demanding it slash interest rates. Trump called Powell“a stupid guy”and said “Powell’s terminationcannot come fast enough!”Trump ultimately chickened out on firing Powell after financial markets tumbled at the prospect, but he hasn’t stopped pressing the Fed to chop its rates –suggesting they should be below 1%– to spur the slowing economy. Although Trump keeps denying it, heinherited a robust economy from Joe Biden. It’s Trump’s tariffs and the humongous economic uncertainty they created that have dragged down economic growth.The reason most central banks worldwide have independence is that lawmakers realized long ago that if presidents or prime ministers control central banks, they will often cut interest rates too aggressively to goose economic growth short-term and lift their popularity. But a few years hence, that often leaves the nation, and their successors, with painfully high inflation.Trump apparently holds the misbegotten notion that if he takes control of the Fed and its interest rates, then only good things will happen. He’s convinced that this would not only reduce the interest rates that consumers pay onmortgages, but wouldsave the federal governmenthuge sums by reducing the interest rates paid on the bonds that finance the nation’s colossal $37.5tn debt.Federal Reserve cuts US interest rates for first time since DecemberRead moreBut central bankers and economists warn that Trump-orchestrated rate cuts could backfire big time. In a New York Times opinion piece,Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen,former Federal Reserve chairs, wrote: “A particularly clear lesson of history is that when central banks are forced to finance government deficits – by keeping interest rates excessively low, to cite one possibility – the result is inevitably higher inflation and economic damage.”In other words, if Trump muscles his way into controlling the Fed and slashing its rates, financial markets might worry that Trump’s power play will further push up inflation (beyond the inflation his tariffs are already causing). Core inflation is running at 3.1%, well above the Fed’s target of 2.0%. That’s a big reason Powell opposes steep rate cuts (notwithstanding theFed’s quarter-percent rate cut on Tuesday).As any non-Trumpian economist will tell you, the higher inflation resulting from Trump-induced rate cuts is likely to cause interest rates to rise on mortgages, auto loans and the bonds that finance the nation’s $37.5tn debt. What’s more, that higher inflation could rattle stock markets and cause the dollar to sink against other currencies.Never an assiduous student of history, Trump probably doesn’t realize that some not-too-distant episodes of political interference in Fed policy didn’t end well. After the second world war, Harry Truman’s treasury department pressured the Fed to hold down interest rates to make it easier to finance the war debt. That helped fuel double-digit inflation in the late 1940s.Richard Nixon pressed Arthur Burns, then Federal Reserve chair, to hold down interest rates to help Nixon win re-election 1972. By doing Nixon’s bidding, Burns helped fuel a burst of late 70s inflation that caused his successor as Fed chair, Paul Volcker, to jack up interest rates to 20% to tame inflation. Those 20% rates threw the US into a deep recession. “Once Fed credibility is lost, it can be costly to regain, as the depth of the Volcker recession demonstrated,” Bernanke and Yellen wrote.Then there’s the case of Turkey, where Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ended the central bank’s independence and engineered big interest rate cuts to goose Turkey’s economy. Soon, Turkey’s inflation soared to 80% as its currency went into free fall. Ultimately, a chastened Erdoğan appointed a central bank head who hikedinterest rates to 50% from 8.5%to sharply reduce inflation.Trump’s supporters say no way would he be so unwise or aggressive on interest rates, but didn’t he impose asky-high 145% tariffon China? This summer, Trumpurged the Fed to slash ratesfrom 4.5% to1%or 1.5%. Paul Krugman, a Nobel prize-winning economist, wrote, “That’s an enormous drop– one which has never been done except in the teeth of a deep recession … the implications will be profound and disastrous. The United States will be well on its way to becoming Turkey, where an authoritarian ruler imposed his crackpot economics on the central bank, sending inflation soaring to 80%.”In recent weeks, Trump has stepped up his war on the Fed’s independence. He nominated Stephen Miran, head of the Council of Economic Advisers, to be a Fed governor. Miran, whowas confirmed this week, said he would take a leave of absence from the economic council – as opposed to resigning – in a move showing more loyalty to Trump than Fed independence.Byseeking to fire Lisa Cook, Trump became the first president in US history to try to remove a Fed governor. Trump’s move appeared to violate the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which says Fed governors can only be fired for “cause”. Trump ordered her firing without giving her anydue process, saying he was firing her because, he said, she owns two different homes that she calls primary residences even though there’s strong evidence she told her bank that one wasa vacation home.Thus far two lower courts have enjoined Cook’s firing andon Thursday, Trump appealedthe case to the supreme court. If the justices uphold Trump’s firing of Cook despite the slim evidence that she did anything wrong, then every Fed governor will fear getting fired if they do the least thing Trump doesn’t like – for instance, if they oppose cutting rates because inflation is rising due to Trump’s tariffs.Over the years, everyone from progressive economists to Republican presidents have urged the Fed to cut rates to speed growth and reduce unemployment. (In 1992, I did an Oval Officeinterview with George HW Bushin which he called on the Fed to lower rates.) It’s healthy discourse for Americans – whether presidents, politicians or professors – to urge the Fed to cut rates. But it’s not at all healthy for a president to destroy the Fed’s independence and turn its members into puppets who make decisions based on a their wishes instead of sound economics and data. That’s a dangerous recipe for fast-rising inflation and long-term interest rates.Trump’s policies are largely responsible for today’s worsening economy: slowing growth, rising prices and soaring federal debt. Trump’s tariffs have undercut GDP growth and increased inflation, while his Big Beautiful tax cuts will add $3tn to the national debt and push up long-term interest rates.Trump could go far to fix these problems by scrapping his unpopular tariffs and repealing his huge tax giveaway to the rich. But instead Trump wants the Federal Reserve to somehow fix those problems, and he will keep bullying, bashing and blaming the Fed unless it does his bidding.Sadly, this is yet another example of Trump refusing to take responsibility for his policy mistakes and rushing to pin the blame on others.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsFederal ReserveOpinionDonald TrumpUS economycommentShareReuse this content"

On the surface, it is about flags, identity and political allegiance. But to me, as an American living in Britain, recent events reveal something deeper: both our societies are normalising hate ​and othering in ways that corrode not only our politics but our souls.The something is aggressions and micro-aggressions: a coarsening of everyday encounters. I have snapshots. Recently, at a celebrated creative hub in London, I twice endured blatant bias. My guests and I – the only all-Black table in the room – were left in the dark, literally. As night fell, every other table was given a lamp except ours. When I raised it with management, I was interrupted, dismissed and told it was an oversight. A Black staff member was sent to smooth things over​. An official later told me that while they had “a different view of what happened”, they accepted that this was “how [I] experienced it” and admitted it “fell short of [their] usual standards”. My Blackness was overlooked, diminished and dismissed – while whiteness was appreciated, affirmed and celebrated, in a space that loudly markets itself as a home of “belonging”.​The pendulum has swung back. Much more overt aggression is normalised in a way I haven’t seen in years. Recently in US airports and restaurants, I ​have been called the N-word: a word ​historically intended not ​just to insult, but to erase.These are not minor indignities. They are signs of a culture where suspicion and prejudice are no longer whispered but weaponised. In Colorado, three students were critically wounded after a school shooting. In Minnesota, political leaders were among those targeted in a mass attack by an assailant who compiled a sprawling “hitlist” of dozens of Democrats, though investigators noted he appeared to hold few consistent or coherent ideological beliefs. In Sweden, 10 students and staff members were killed in a tragic attack at an adult education centre in Örebro – a case in whichpolice confirmed“there was nothing … to suggest he had acted on ideological grounds”. Here in Britain, far-right activity and asylum seeker protests have surged, fuelled by a combination of inflammatory rhetoric and relative silence from political leaders.What unites these threads is not ideology but a deficit of empathy. And without empathy, democracies falter.Martin Luther King Jr warned:“Let no man pull you so low as to hate him.”Hatred, he knew, corrodes the hater as much as the hated. Love, by contrast, is the only force capable of transforming both. This is not abstract philosophy. It is lived truth.And the message of Jesus Christ was never about defending doctrines or drawing boundaries of purity. It was a message of radical love – love that crossed lines, embraced the despised and saw the soul beyond the sin. That is the love the world is starving for today.Rabbi Jonathan Sacks made the same case in his 2015 bookNot in God’s Name: “We are all children of Abraham … God is calling us, Jew, Christian and Muslim, to let go of hate and the preaching of hate, and live at last as brothers and sisters … honouring God’s name by honouring his image, humankind.” His challenge was theological, yes, but also civic. Societies cannot thrive if they are built on grievance. Empathy must become a public practice woven into our schools, workplaces and laws. Politicians who thrive on division should be held accountable not only for what they say but for the cultures of cruelty they foster.Even in the US, where free speech is sacrosanct, presidents have acknowledged, rhetorically at least, that liberty cannot mean licence. “We must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry, and violence,”the Trump White House once declared. That statement should apply to every American citizen – bar none – and to every society that claims to be democratic.From Britain’s protests to the US’s violence, public theatre often drowns out deeper questions. The real issue is not which side shouts louder, but whether societies can still summon empathy in an age addicted to division. Free speech is vital for democracy – but without empathy and responsibility, it becomes a blunt instrument that wounds the vulnerable while shielding the powerful.Here in Britain, empathy would mean confronting racism where it hides in plain sight: in private clubs that celebrate whiteness while ignoring Blackness, and in everyday encounters where bias is excused as banter. It would mean reshaping our politics so grievance is not weaponised but grace is prioritised.This is not about sentimentality. Empathy is not naivety. It is an act of moral courage. It means refusing to define people solely by their worst moments. It means seeing the soul in the person across from us – even when their words wound.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I do not feel hatred. Hatred corrodes the soul. Outrage, when held rightly, becomes the fuel for truth-telling – for refusing to allow dignity to be diminished or injustice to be normalised. My hope is that even in the face of such ugliness, we can build a society where empathy does the work that hate once claimed: binding us together, not tearing us apart.What is the endgame in this toxic immigration debate: is it friends and neighbours thrown out of the country? | Jonthan LiewRead moreI think often of my son. He is growing up in a world more toxic than the one I inherited. He will face choices about whether to meet cruelty with cruelty or to answer it with love. What I want him to know; what I want us all to know, is that empathy is not weakness. It is strength. It is the refusal to let hate dictate who we are. In the end, it is the only inheritance worth leaving behind.I think, too, of another child:Charlie Kirk’s son in the US. One will grow up without his father; my own will grow up watching what that boy’s father stood for. Two boys, oceans apart, but inheriting the same question: will we break the cycle of hate? My prayer is that, in different ways, both will come to know this: the only way forward, the only way to heal what is broken, is love.Keith Magee is a theologian and author, andchairs the Guardian FoundationDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Finding joy in others. It’s free, simple and will gladden your heart | Nadine LevyRead moreYou might get a rude shock from the Daodejing. The relatively short Chinese philosophy text is credited to the great master Laozi (who probably didn’t exist). The way of life portrayed in it, Daoism (or Taoism), isn’t a religion in the way of temples and rituals, but more in the way of a philosophy. Living in tune with the natural order is at its heart.The Daodejing is more than 2,000 years old and likely from the warring states period of Chinese history. Its more than 5,000 characters sum up in poetic verse how to live in accordance with “the way’ (the Dao) and its virtues (the De).But if you hope this might read like any other self-help book, you better hold on to your sticky notes.Take its first par:The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.The name that can be named is not the eternal name.You could dismiss this as philosophical gobbledegook, but that’s perhaps the point. I’m not going to even explain it to you. Do your job! You may yell back at me. But its inscrutability is its power. Perhaps those authors knew 2,000 years ago it would be impossible to perfectly convey anything in words and opted instead for a vibe.The ancient Chinese text of the Zhuangzi teaches us to reject entrenched values – and treasure the diversity of humanity | Karyn LaiRead moreI have seen my generation agonise over how to act and how to be. What’s the best thing to say? What words mean what? We spend our time optimising and maxxing all aspects of our lives into aesthetic colour-coded calendars.Thanks to social media, we are more perceived and judged than ever before. Not only are weafraid of embarrassmentbut we are also afraid of being misunderstood and taken out of context. We worry over every word and image to ensure we are expressing ourselves correctly.But the Daodejing shows through contradictions the limitations of words and language:Nothing in all beneath heaven is so soft and weak as water.And yet, for conquering the hard and strong, nothing succeeds like water.And nothing can change it:weak overcoming strong,soft overcoming hard.This is not to say we should all live our life passively without thinking. But I have found living life clutching to absolute ideas and truths to be tiring. In Daoism, this go-with-the-the flow attitude is calledwuwei, and is often translated as effortless action.In explaining this to you, I have given you my biases and prejudices. My idea of what these words mean. My words contain ideas beyond containing. The universe is inherently contradictory: water nurtures yet it drowns, the sun cultivates yet it burns. How can simple words convey what is meant to be experienced with all five senses? I’m unsure of an existence beyond my own cognition. The only person that is able to understand how to walk your path and to do so with virtue is you.As another great philosopher (Yoda) once said: “Do or do not. There is no try”.

When you factor in their parents and carers, it highlights the huge number of people who anxiously watch this area of policy. All of them know that the systems those kids depend on are dysfunctional and broken. And they are also keenly aware of something else: that whereas their experiences once tended to be ignored and overlooked, they have now crossed from the online world into Radio 4’sWoman’s Hour,The One Show, Good Morning Britain and all the rest, as a huge conversation about the politics of all this gets louder and louder.Beyond the worsening Send crisis itself, there are obvious reasons for that: months of anonymous briefings and rumours, and the prospect ofa legislative white paperthat, we are told, will finally arrive at some unspecified point “in the autumn”. At the department for education, Bridget Phillipson – the secretary of state who is also running to beLabour’s deputy leader– says she wants many more children to be included in mainstream schools, and is aiming at a system that is more “timely, more effective, and actually maximises support”. In the vaguest of ways, that might sound reasonable enough, but there have also been rumblings that have caused many Send families no end of concern.Which brings us toanother big figure. Around 640,000 children and young people with Send currently have an education, health and care plan (endless acronyms are an in-built part of the special needs universe – these are known as EHCPs). These documents are the responsibility of local authorities and, in theory, they set out the specific help and support individual kids need as a matter of legally enforceable rights: their numbers have gone up in recent years chiefly because, in an endlessly squeezed school system, they are often the only way of securing dependable help.Getting an EHCP is usually a grinding struggle, and making sure the provision they set out actually materialises can entail the same kind of fight. But for parents and carers whose lives are often a mess of unreturned phone calls and emails, along with theofficial Send tribunal, they represent a precious means of accountability. Moreover, if the kind of dedicated help they provide and its foundation in law were either diluted or done away with, many kids’ inclusion in mainstream schools would be impossible (I speak from experience here: my son is autistic andhas an EHCP, and without it, the productive years he spent in mainstream schools would have been unthinkable). Even if the government’s Send reforms start to work, that will remain the case for a long time to come.Supporting kids with Send is expensive. But the cost of not doing so is far greater | Carrie GrantRead moreLate last year, whispers from the top of governmentbegan to circulate, about drastically restricting the number of EHCPs. Ministers, meanwhile, have refused to be drawn on whether or not EHCPs and the very clear rights they enshrine will survive their reforms at all. The current line is that there will always be “a legal right to extra support”for Send kids. But that could mean very different things: either a continuation of EHCPs and the needs-based rights they provide, or a fairly meaningless guarantee that kids will be legally entitled to whatever the state decides it can offer. Among parents and Send professionals, the result has been a mixture of queasy anxiety and increasing frustration.Last week, two big developments showed that similar feelings are now spreading through Westminster. The first happened on Monday, when a huge crowd of Send familiesgathered outside parliamentfor a lunchtime protest addressed by – among others – the Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey, while inside MPsprepared for a debateabout the Send crisis, and the prospect of big changes to the system. Thanks to Rachel Filmer, a parent from Poole who is one of the prime movers in the newSave Our Children’s Rightscampaign (full disclosure: I am also involved),a petitionopposing any moves on families’ legal entitlements had surpassed 100,000 signatures – which led on toa three-hour session in Westminster Hall. Ninety MPs were there, the kind of turnout that speaks volumes about how hot these issues have become.It was fascinating to watch: one of those occasions when MPs talk about the human stories contained in their casework, and depart from the usual pre-written party lines. OneLabourMP said that many of his constituents wanted “reassurance regarding education, health and care plans. They do not want them to be scrapped; they would like a personalised plan, such as the EHCP, to remain in the reformed system.” Another asked the government to confirm that “legal protections will be in place for those families who so desperately need that support”. Lib Dems, Greens and Tories voiced the same opinions – and, even among the more on-message Labour MPs present, beyond one or two veiled hints, there were no arguments for either restricting or getting rid of EHCPs.View image in fullscreenLiberal Democrat party leader Ed Davey speaks to protesters outside parliament on 15 September 2025.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockThree days later came a real watershed moment:the publication of a reportfrom the Commons’ education select committee, which has been immersed in an exhaustive inquiry into the Send crisis for the last eight months. Though it says that the current need and demand for EHCPs is “unsustainable”, it insists – entirely correctly – that the solution to that problem lies in doggedly improving ordinary, everyday support, not taking rights away and leaving children stranded.Whatever the government’s answer to the Send crisis, the report says: “The solution cannot be to remove the statutory entitlements from a system which lacks accountability in many other areas and in which parents already have so little trust and confidence … The Send reforms must not be based on any withdrawal of statutory entitlements for children and young people with Send.” Those words do not need much translating.One BBC headlinecrisply summed them up as, “Don’t scrap care plans for children with special educational needs, say MPs”. The Labour chair of the committee, Helen Hayes,was almost as blunt: “There should be no reduction in that entitlement and no raising of the threshold for that entitlement.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Back in the spring, with his usual blithe disregard for the complexities of the real world, the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said that the NHS was“massively overdiagnosing”special needs and disabilities. Early this month, Richard Tice, the party’s deputy leader,said that Send spendingwas “being hijacked by far too many parents who are abusing the system, taking it for a ride”. These are the blowhards and know-nothings who may yet move from local to national government: they do not seem to have given any thought to the idea that to make that leap, millions of Send parents and their friends and families will be among the voters they will need.For now, as that white paper approaches, I am more interested in what Reform’s poisonous banalities might mean for the balance of opinion among other MPs, and Labour people in particular. It feels as if there is a mounting realisation in Westminster that existing Send rights increasingly look like a precious wall of defence against the cruelty that would be let loose if Reform took national power. And I increasingly sense something else: a rising aversion to standing anywhere near anyone who believes in the modern myths of “overdiagnosis” or the idea that changes to the Send system ought to start with snatching away rights and entitlements.I would like to think the same sentiments have surfaced in the education department. In only a matter of weeks, we will see. But in the meantime, for millions of people all too used to silence and slow service, the wait goes on.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsOpinionBridget PhillipsonChildrenLabourAutismcommentShareReuse this content"

It inspiredhundreds of thousands to sign up. It ignited real hope, for the first time in decades, that a party based on socialist principles, and committed to grassroots democracy, could present a serious challenge to Margaret Thatcher’s dictum that there was no alternative.Expectations were high, the hope was exhilarating. Communication from the centre was sporadic and increasingly unsatisfactory, but still the enthusiasm remained.Now thelast few days have causedanxiety, confusion, despair and not a little anger. Many are at a loss to understand it, but the effect is devastating.

But a host of issues, from housing to mental health, is getting in the waySun 21 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 21 Sep 2025 09.46 EDTShare“Why aren’t women having babies?” It’s the question on everyone’s lips as the fertility rateplummets to a record lowin England, Scotland and Wales. A range of answers are always trotted out, from the entirely reasonable (childcare and housing costs; the motherhood career penalty) to the ludicrous (being so dim about our own fertility that we wake up one day realising we’ve left it too late). Yet perhaps it’s time we ask not only “why aren’t women having babies?”, but also “why aren’t men?”Men are largely invisible in the birthrate debate. It’s ironic that amid all the pontificating and the policy ideas for encouraging more women to have babies – a conversation often being had by men – the other half of humanity is strikingly underexamined. Part of the problem is an absence of data: like many European countries, we don’t really have any on male fertility. Without data, we only have half the picture.So what do we know? Well, we know what isdriving the birthrate crisisis not really people having fewer children, but far fewer people becoming parents at all. As the demographer Stephen J Shaw recently wrote, childlessness is on the rise despite the fact that most people still say that they want children. He highlighted how unplanned childlessness – or involuntary infertility – could often be down to simply not being able to find the right partner. This makes sense in light of what is being termed a “relationship recession” or a “mating gap”. People are simply not coupling up like they used to.The anxiety-inducing statistic Shaw cites is that a British woman who reached the age of 28 without children in 2023 had only a 50% chance of becoming a mother. What he doesn’t ask is this: if most women still want to have children, what is happening to suitable, willing male partners as people enter their late 20s and 30s?Dr Joe Strong, a demographer and fellow at Queen Mary University of London, tells me that male-female couples tend to be closer in age than ever before, and that university-educated men are also postponing having children. “Evidence from among men and women in relationships shows that a major reason for delaying childbirth is waiting until both people are ready,” he says. “Decisions aren’t made in a vacuum; men’s postponement of childbirth is tied up with the huge economic and social obstacles that women face.”This echoed feelings raised by the men I have spoken to. Of those who were in couples and wanted children (there were a few who simply didn’t), waiting until a female partner was ready, or had established her career, had been a major factor, as was getting on the property ladder. Of those who were single, it was about finding someone who you’re sure you want to do it with in a dating culture that doesn’t always feel conducive to that goal.Tom, in his late thirties, wanted kids with his ex, whom he was with for several years, but she didn’t want children with him. Now that he’s single, he speaks not of a “biological clock” (although men do actually have one of those, too) but of a “psychological clock”. “You don’t have an infinite amount of time to get to know someone well enough to know really in your heart of hearts whether you want to spend the rest of your life raising a child [with them]”, he tells me.Then there’s the economics of it. Tom is on universal credit after losing his job. “Is it even possible, logistically, financially to have a child any more? It doesn’t feel like it for me. It doesn’t feel like it’s ever going to be in the near future,” he says. He couldn’t afford the housing or childcare needed to raise a child in the city, and moving away would mean being isolated from the community of friends and family that everyone needs when they become a parent.Strong notes that “increasing labour market precarity means it is harder for men to fulfil social expectations of being able to ‘provide’ for families.” It used to be far easier to launch yourself into the adult world: housing and living costs were more affordable, jobs were often plentiful. Having a child at, say, 25, when you’d been living independently since the age of 18, perhaps felt more normal than it does now, and certainly more doable when you didn’t need two incomes to sustain housing costs. If you’re still living with your parents, or in a shared house and suffering from crushing depression, having babies is unlikely to be on your mind, especially if you can barely afford to go out for a drink.On top of economic circumstances, though, has been a fundamental shift in how we have come to see having a child. What used to be a “cornerstone” life event – something that you did as you entered adult life – is now a “capstone” one, meaning something you do when you’ve ticked off all those other life goals. Except ticking them off feels harder and harder.“There is no one size fits all explanation for men’s fertility decisions,” Strong points out. “Decisions on whether and when to have children vary enormously across contexts and demographic groups.” This is a nuanced conversation that requires nuanced solutions. We need to know more about all the factors influencing male fertility and the birthrate, from modern dating culture and porn to housing, the male mental health crisis and cannabis use. If you’re in your 20s or 30s, you’ll probably be having these conversations with people all the time. I know that I am. It makes their absence from the discourse all the more striking.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionChildrenWomenMenFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

A military warplane dropped two 500lb (230kg) bombs on their boarding school, witnesses said. Imagine, if you can, the carnage and the horror.At least 18 died. Others suffered life-changing injuries. The ruling regime claims to be fighting terrorists. Yet more often than not, it is defenceless, blameless civilians who are killed, maimed and displaced. No, this isn’t Gaza. It isn’t Ukraine. It’s Myanmar, where appalling atrocities, including crimes against humanity, often go unreported and unpunished. That doesn’t render them any less heinous or less deserving of universal condemnation.Myanmar, formerly British-run colonial Burma, where civil war has raged since an army coup overthrew the elected government in 2021, is a microcosm of today’s fractured world. National leaders gatheringat the UN general assembly this weekface numerous daunting problems: among them, the authoritarian assault on democracy; record levels of conflict; pervasive flouting of human rights; impunity in the committing of genocide and war crimes; humanitarian emergenciesexacerbated by foreign aid cuts; rising poverty; and environmentally damaging exploitation of less-developed countries’ natural resources.Isolated, neglected, violence-wracked Myanmar suffers from all these ills. Viewed in this global context, it represents a test of the dwindling capacity of the UN-led system, regional organisations and “great powers” to maintain order and uphold shared laws and values. It’s a test they are failing miserably. And when it comes to China and Russia, and increasingly Donald Trump, the failure is intentional. As in many other so-called conflict zones, what is happening day after day in Myanmar is a largely un-observed, international disgrace. Myanmar holds up a mirror toa world of pain.The ruling junta led byMin Aung Hlaing, an absurdly bemedalled Chaplin-esque dictator, is wholly illegitimate. Nationwide protests sparked by its overthrow of Nobel peace prize-winnerAung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy government were brutally suppressed. Rivalrous ethnic armed organisations subsequently seized large areas from the military – including much of western Rakhine state, where this month’s school bombing occurred. Undeterred, Min Aung Hlaingplanning elections in Decemberto rebrand his regime andcement his rule. It’s already clear that the polls, if they go ahead, will almost certainly be a travesty, their results likely fixed in advance.Support from neighbouring China is key to the junta’s survival. As ever, Beijing prefers “strongman” rule to genuine democracy, prioritising state control, security and its infrastructure, energy and mining investments. President Xi Jinpingwelcomed Min Aung Hlaing, accused by international criminal court prosecutors ofcrimes against humanity, to his second world war anniversary parade this month. Exhibiting similar disregard for democracy and human rights in Myanmar, India’s leader, Narendra Modi,also embraced the dictatorand backed his sham election. As chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), Malaysia insists a ceasefire must precede any vote. But Thailand and Cambodia have broken ranks.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of an airstrike in Thayet Thapin village in Rakhine state, Myanmar, 12 September 2025.Photograph: APFurther reflecting contemporary geopolitical schisms, Vladimir Putin’s Russia, which is the junta’s main arms supplier and has extensive experience of bombing civilians, is also closely aligned with Myanmar’s child-murderers. More surprising, and disturbing, is growing US ambivalence. Trump has sanctioned criminal gangs andethnic militiasthat run junta-fosteredscam centres, people trafficking and drug-smuggling operations. But in July, the USeased some restrictions, fuelling suspicion that, in return for Myanmar’s rare earth minerals, Washington may recognise the regime. This softening coincided with a lubricious letter from Min Aung Hlaingpraising Trump’s “strong leadership”.The suffering of Myanmar’s people knows no bounds. Thousands of civilians have died since the coup; thousands more are held without trial. Up to 4 millionhave been displacedand pushed further into poverty. After anearthquake struck in March, junta forces continued airstrikes, ignoring a supposed ceasefire and blocking emergency aid. Last month UN investigators said summary executions and the “systematic torture” of detainees, including burning of genitals, gang-rape, strangulation, beatings and electric shocks, were part of “a pattern of atrocities which isintensifying across the country”.In addition, the plight of victims of an earlier crime – the Myanmar army’s genocidal2017 pogromthat drove more than 700,000 mostly Muslim Rohingya residents of Rakhine state across the border into Bangladesh – grows steadily worse. Ongoing fighting, plus hate attacks by Buddhist-majority militia, have forced a further 150,000 Rohingyato fleesince 2024. Now US and, prospectively, UK foreign aid cuts mean food and medical assistance is running out for the more than 1 million exiles in Bangladeshi camps. The UN refugee agency warns that by December, on current trends, there will be no food at all.By almost any measure, Myanmar’s crisis is everyone’s crisis, reflecting the failings of a dysfunctional world. What is to be done? A special session of the UN general assembly next week will seek a “sustainable resolution” of the problems facing Rohingya and other Myanmar minorities. The EU and Britain, as UN security council Myanmar “penholder”, must do more; additional sanctions are imperative. Yet it remains unlikely that Asean or the US will adopt a more interventionist stance – or that China will suddenly see the light.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was such a sweetheart.”Perhaps it is because he is currently filming King Lear that Pacino is preoccupied with our collective crawl toward death. He recently rewatched his younger self in Dog Day Afternoon, a Hollywood classic that celebrates its 50th anniversary on Sunday, and was struck by how many of the cast are now gone.“It hits you, seeing all those people in Dog Day,” the 85-year-old says by phone from Los Angeles. “Can you imagine how you feel? Wow. It’s like a dream. You’re dreaming. You have a dream of someone and you’re so happy about the dream and then you wake up and they’re not there any more? They don’t even exist – in three dimensions anyway.”‘Say hello to my little pen’: 14 things we learned from Al Pacino’s memoirRead moreCinema, of course, is one way to cheat death, at least in two dimensions. On screen Pacino will forever be a raw, vulnerable, incandescent presence in Dog Day Afternoon, a crime drama based on the true story of a bank heist that went wrong – and one of the earliest mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge that transgender people existed.Pacino plays Sonny Wortzik, a desperate man who, along with his partner Sal (John Cazale), attempts to rob a bank in Brooklyn, New York, to fund his partner’s gender-transition surgery. The heist turns into a chaotic hostage situation as Sonny’s personal struggles and a media frenzy unfold. The movie was directed bySidney Lumetand won an Oscar for Frank Pierson’s screenplay.Pacino had just played Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part II, a tough act for anyone to follow. He was approached about Dog Day Afternoon by Martin Bregman, who had been his personal manager and the producer of Serpico, also directed by Lumet and starring Pacino.“He told me he wanted me to do it, and I had read it and thought it was well-written but I didn’t want to do it,” Pacino recalls. “I was in London at the time and I thought, I’m running out of gas. I don’t know if I could do this again.“It seemed having that kind of intensity again and going through that was too close, I thought, to The Godfather II, which was an intense experience in a lot of ways – not the actual work but everything that had been happening in my personal life was affecting me.”Pacino turned the role down. “I thought, all right, I understand it’s a great offer and thank you but I don’t think I can do this. I’d like to pass.” He adds with a chuckle: “Once again, I’ve got some kind of gun and I’m gonna go in a bank and rob it: I don’t want to go through that.”Pacino settled back into life in New York but then“Bregman came back to mebecause they had someone else who said they wanted to do it, who was notorious, who was a famous actor.”Widely reported to beDustin Hoffman?Pacino denies knowledge of this, describing instead how Bregman persuaded him to take another look at the script. “He calls me. I read the text and realise this is more than what I even thought it was. This is an interesting, powerful piece of work. I knew Sidney was involved, who I loved; we did Serpico together.“The first thought I had was, why did I pass this up? Where was I in my head? He [Bregman] was a very wise man. I said, ‘Why aren’t I doing this, Mr B?’ He said, ‘I don’t know. Why aren’t you doing it?’ I said, ‘Yeah, OK, I’ll do it.’ He said, ‘All right.’ I guess he had some work to do or whatever he did but they gave me the part and that was it.”Al Pacino on how he got his Modigliani film off the ground after 30 yearsRead moreLumet gave the cast – many of whom had worked with Pacino on stage – three weeks to rehearse before shooting began, a rarity in the film industry. But Pacino had trouble finding his feet.He says: “For some reason, I felt as though I didn’t know who the character I was playing was. I kind of left that out of the rehearsals or something. I don’t know what happened but I knew when I saw something on the screen I said: no. I saw I didn’t have a character so I thought, what am I doing, where am I, who am I, where am I going?“I went home that night, took half a gallon of white wine, which I don’t usually drink, for some reason and spent the whole night finding a character within myself from the script. I come in the next day and of course Lumet is looking at me like, what happened, Al? The cast – my friends – are saying, ‘I think he’s having a breakdown.’“But I wasn’t. I was becoming somebody else, I think. I was becoming the guy that’s in the film. I don’t know to this day if I was kidding myself or what. But I did go through that and it helped me. Let’s put it that way: whether I was right or wrong to do it, it did help me with it. I had something to work with personally.”View image in fullscreenA poster for Dog Day Afternoon.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarOne of the film’s most famous lines was improvised on the spur of the moment. It was a reference a 1971 incident in which prisoners seized control of the maximum-security Attica correctional facility near Buffalo, New York, taking 42 staff members hostage and demanding improvements to inmate treatment and living conditions. The standoff ended in a violent assault by state police resulting in the deaths of 33 prisoners and 10 hostages, making it the deadliest prison riot in US history.With the heist in progress, Pacino’s character sometimes steps out of the bank to talk to the police, watched by a crowd of extras who have begun to cheer each appearance. Before one such exchange, the assistant director Burtt Harris whispered to Pacino to ask the crowd about Attica.“The cameras are rolling. He comes up to me. He says, ‘Come here, come here. Al, say Attica.’ I say, ‘What the f–.’ He says, ‘Say Attica.’ I’m on the run so I go out and I’m there and it’s in my head because I know all about Attica because I was around when it was happening.”As he sees a police officer moving towards him, Sonny shouts: “He wants to kill me so bad he can taste it!” Pacino recalls: “It seemed like the right spot. I said, ‘Remember Attica! Attica!’ The crowd took off. It was like a fuse that started lighting everybody up.“I started screaming because we all felt the same way about what happened at Attica. I mean, it was amazing. I knew I had them then. Those kind of things can happen in film; they occasionally do. As long as you don’t force-feed it, as long as it becomes a natural environmental thing that happens, it just happens.”Another totemic scene, in which Sonny and his partner Leon (Chris Sarandon), who identifies as a woman, have a long phone conversation, was improvised across three takes that Lumet then cut together. Pacino says: “One day he told me right there outside, ‘Al, this is out of our hands. It’s got its own life.’”Lumet was a giant of cinema whose other works would include 12 Angry Men,Networkand The Verdict. Pacino says: “He was the greatest director I ever worked with, in terms of working with. There’s other great directors, of course, I was fortunate enough to be with and film with, but as far as Sidney was concerned, he was understanding of the actors.“Directors came to see Sidney work. When he was on the cameras, how he operates, how he sets up a shot.”Pacino was “stunned” to meet the Italian directorFederico Fellinion the set of Dog Day Afternoon. Fellini had wanted him for a part but then decided he was not the right fit. “I remember him saying a compliment to me: ‘You are too good-looking for this role.’ I thought, wow, he knows how to handle an actor, doesn’t he? What a thing to say. OK!”View image in fullscreenAl Pacino and Penny Allen in Dog Day Afternoon.Photograph: Images/Rex ShutterstockA stage adaptation of Dog Day Afternoon isheading for Broadwaynext year, starringJon BernthalandEbon Moss-Bachrach, both known for their work on The Bear, and directed byRupert Goold. Pacino wishes them well. Why does he think the film, which captures the grit of 1970s New York so entirely, continues to resonate after half a century?“I would say it held up because somehow Lumet got to the humanity of it and the connection of it and the period. It plays more today than it even did then.”Pacino’s recent viewing of the film was on a big screen, which he heartily recommends. But he also enjoys TV – he lovedAdolescenceon Netflix – and has also become addicted to YouTube. “I live for it. It runs the gamut from A to Z. You can see anything you want - everything has been shot and interpreted.”But he is well aware that also means plenty of disinformation. “I saw the other day that I died again,” he laughs. “You see it all the time with celebs. ‘We want to give our condolences.’ Well, I think either I have it wrong or you have it wrong. I seem to be here!”Al Pacino on the inside story of The Godfather: ‘I was told, you’re not cutting it’Read moreMany in Hollywood might observe thatDonald Trumpis contributing to the breakdown of a shared set of facts. Pacino, however, remains tight-lipped as always. “I was never known to talk about politics,” he says. “I know something’s going on that’s a little different but at the same time I don’t go there. I certainly don’t go there in my public life. I just avoided it.”That makes him different from his contemporary and Godfather Part II co-star Robert De Niro, whohaslambastedTrumprepeatedly. Pacino says cheerfully:“He’s his guy. He’s his own person. He feels things and he says them and I think it’s really cool. I love Bob. Bob and I go back forever. He is someone I love.”Redford might be gone but De Niro and Pacino march on. Ripeness is all, as Pacino will presumably say in the upcomingLear Rex, in which he stars withRachel Brosnahan,Jessica Chastain, Ariana DeBose andPeter Dinklage.Still, he has reached an age when it is time to take stock. Last year he published amemoir,Sonny Boy, reflecting on his singular life and career. He jokes that he will speak to the Guardian again to mark the book’s 50th anniversary, which would be 2074.“You’ll be old enough,” he says, amused but with a touch of melancholy. “I won’t be here though. It’s a shame, isn’t it? It’s a shame we have to go away. God only knows: will we have memories when we go away? Memories are so important.”Explore more on these topicsAl PacinoDrama filmsFilm industrySidney LumetRobert De NirointerviewsShareReuse this content"

It was the cliche of stopping you in your tracks, so I had to sit on my bed and experience it. I still find it completely haunting.The first single I boughtIt was my 12th or 13th birthday and my stepdad [Foreigner guitarist Mick Jones] gave me 20 bucks, so I went and bought four 12-inches from Tower Records on 66 and Broadway, including (Nothing Serious) Just Buggin’ by Whistle and Let’s Go All the Way by Sly Fox.The song I do at karaokeI don’t do karaoke because I can’t sing. I’ve also been blessed to work with some of the most incredible singers who you’d never want to sing in front of. Gun to my head, I would do Drops of Jupiter by Train.The song I inexplicably know every lyric toNow it’s everything my two-year-old daughter listens to, although some of the Sesame Street songs from the 70s still have a magic quality, like Somebody Come and Play by the Sesame Street Kids.The best song to play at a partyYou can’t lose if you throw on Young Hearts Run Free by Candi Staton, because it just unites everybody. If you don’t find your body moving to it, you don’t have a pulse. I also like the Kym Mazelle cover from the 1996 soundtrack of Romeo + Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes that has made its way to the TikTok generation.The song I can no longer listen toI don’t know if there’s a song that I used to love that I’ve burned out on. I don’t actively listen to my own songs, but if I’m at a wedding and Uptown Funk comes on, I’m not telling the DJ to turn it off.The song I secretly like, but tell everybody I hateI used to love Pantera as a kid. So, This Love by them.The best song to have sex toI cannot listen to music during sex because my brain will start to drift. I’ll wonder what mic they used on the snare. It’s the same reason that I can’t run to music, because the rhythm dictates my pace. If anything, I need something that washes over me, like Music for Airports by Brian Eno which goes on for 48 minutes, so that’s plenty of time.The song that changed my lifeI was in a funk, rock and heavy metal band called the Whole Earth Mamas, playing clubs in New York. We idolised bands like Living Colour and 24-7 Spyz. When I heard They Reminisce Over You (TROY) by Pete Rock & CL Smooth, I was so blown away, I thought: “I only want to play this sort of music now,” so I became a DJ.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He presented 232 episodes of the BBC consumer action show Watchdog – working with his wife,Lynn Faulds Wood, who died in 2020 – and was a stalwart of cornflakes broadcasting for both main networks in the UK: presenting the BBC’s Breakfast Time and four iterations of ITV daybreak shows, including Good Morning Britain.But Stapleton,who has died aged 79, was at core a serious and brave reporter. He made films for the BBC’s Panorama and Newsnight and for ITV’s World in Action, frequently covering international conflicts, including the 1982 Falklands Conflict and the 2003 Iraq War, for which he won a Royal Television Society prize.Broadcaster John Stapleton dies aged 79Read moreStapleton was a beneficiary of a period – captured in Michael Frayn’s 1967 novel Towards the End of the Morning – when newspaper reporters and television companies were mutually enraptured with each other. With print credentials from the Oldham Evening Chronicle and then The Daily Sketch in London, Stapleton joined ThamesTelevision, first as a researcher on This Is Your Life and then a reporter for the network’s evening magazine show, Tonight.View image in fullscreenJohn Stapleton with Lynn Faulds Wood, his wife and fellow presenter on Watchdog.Photograph: Radio Times/Getty ImagesLikeMichael Parkinson, another Northern newspaper reporter who became a TV star, Stapleton never forgot his journalistic instinct, although, in his first high-profile screen appearances, the audience might not have been aware of them.He fronted a sexist relic, the Miss United Kingdom contest, in 1976 and 77. This beginning soon proved to be atypical of his career and is likely to have happened because the then 30-year-old presenter – with good looks that remained improbably boyish into old age, due to discipline and genetic luck rather than cosmetic intervention – was one of few reporters who could move among so-called “beauty queens” without shades of a slavering sketch on The Benny Hill Show.A happier early berth was Nationwide, a more journalistic BBC One ancestor of The One Show, where a mix of hard news (Northern Ireland) and consumer investigations and presenting shifts shaped a broadcasting persona that well fitted breakfast television when it began in Britain in the early 1980s. Watchdog grew up from puppy strands of shopper advocacy on Nationwide and Breakfast News so Stapleton was a natural choice to front it, co-hosting with specialist consumer journalist Faulds Wood, who he had married after first meeting her in a pub near Thames, his first employer.It is a measure of Stapleton’s presentational reliability that he is one of relatively few broadcasters to have moved easily between the BBC and ITV, where journalistic approaches could be very different. Another tribute to his professionalism is that although ITV kept panicking and changing the format of its morning shows – TV-AM, GMTV, Daybreak, Good Morning Britain – he was involved in each iteration. Always trustworthy as a frontman, he also brought employers an adaptability, rooted in his newspaper training, that meant he could double as a reporter in battle zones and at election counts in the UK or US. As well as negotiating international time-zones, he also moved easily around the television clock, comfortable at breakfast, prime-time or mid-morning, where he hosted ITV’s The Time, The Place from 1991-98.View image in fullscreenStapleton on Lorraine, 13 Nov 2024.Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/ShutterstockThough eschewing the on-screen cosiness of some other husband-and-wife presenter couples, Stapleton and Faulds Wood were possibly happier together off-screen than those showier duos.They suffered much medical misfortune – bowel and skin cancer for her, Parkinson’s disease for him – but, first together and then him alone, commendably brought their reporting skill to these traumas, identifying symptoms, treatments and mitigations that might help others in a medicalised form of consumer journalism. He appeared on one of the few morning shows he never presented – GB News’ The Great British Breakfast – as a guest as recently as last month.John and Lynn’s son, Nick Stapleton, continues the family business of keeping an eye on businesses family and otherwise inBBC One’s Scam Interceptors, one of the many heirs of a genre his parents did so much to create and grace.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s duetted with Ozzy Osbourne, he livestreamed Nirvana covers for charity during lockdown. Now, on latest album F-1 Trillion, he’s gone country, explaining the preponderance among the audience of Stetsons and cowboy boots, doubtless getting their first airing since Beyoncé’s Country Carter shows here in June.Tonight, Malone ricochets with chaotic panache between rock, trap and twang, never making a big deal out of it. To create this patchwork of supposedly divergent elements in a moment when the culture war is using such divisions to break America apart, feels almost political. His hand-picked opening act – fellow chart-topping rap-to-country convert Jelly Roll – references those divisions explicitly, offering his music as “medicine” and promising, on breakthrough hit I Am Not Okay, “it’s gonna be alright”.Malone, however, isn’t one for preaching. He’s an entertainer, a genial, gently wasted presence who’ll drag a guy from the audience to sit cross-legged beside him on a campfire reading of Stay, who’ll lead the crowd in chants of “Ozzy! Ozzy!” and do press-ups on the gangway as barrages of pyro explode around him. With his just-woke-up hair, scruffy beard, vintage Ozzy T-shirt, cigarette and polystyrene beaker always in hand, Malone’s styled himself like an outlaw country shit-kicker from the 70s (albeit one with facial tattoos and platinum grills), though his music is slick and owes more to Jon Bon Jovi than Johnny Cash. If he leans too often towards power-balladry, it’s because he’s a genre-blind shark, hunting hooks and anthemic moments wherever he finds them.He finishes the set in a glass box above the audience, telling them they can do whatever they want if they try – that enduring American dream, one that’s getting ever harder to believe in. But when it’s sold by a man with a whiskey-stewed rocker’s rasp that keeps slipping into the sweet, singsong melodiousness of a dancehall lothario, simply dripping dangerous, oblivious charm as he swaggers, “I’ve got ‘Fuck you’ money!”, it’s not hard to see how it seduces.Explore more on these topicsPost MalonePop and rockRapreviewsShareReuse this content"

The difficulties we encounter are frequently the result of self-sabotage, and managing them often requires wrestling with our own drives, doing our best not to give in to every impulse. This is easier said than done, of course. To lose weight and keep it off, to successfully climb out of debt, to find meaningful work, to maintain long-term, happy relationships: all demand postponing our immediate desires in the service of a longer-term goal.Delaying gratification, as it’s called, has been a useful tactic for aeons. But at a certain point it becomes reasonable to ask: why doessomuch of modern life seem to involve swimming upstream? Why is it that following our instincts often seems to land us in so much trouble?One of the central ideas in the field of evolutionary psychology is that of “evolutionary mismatch”. Put simply, we evolved in a very different environment from the one in which we now find ourselves. As a result, our brains, bodies and instincts are poorly matched to their surroundings.How much does this really matter? Isn’t a hallmark of being human our species’ ability to adapt to changing circumstances? Yes and no. Yes, we have a remarkable ability to deal with new problems, collaborate to find solutions, and create technology to help us realise them. At the same time, anthropologists estimate that human genetics and anatomy have remained largely unchanged for about 100,000 years. Back then, we lived in small nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes, only developing agriculture about 10,000 years ago and civilisations 5,000 years ago.For all but avanishingly small number of us, the contemporary human habitat isn’t the one we were made for. Genetic adaptations (which can take tens of thousands of years) could hardly be expected to keep up with the move to cities, let alone technological and cultural shifts, which can have dramatic impacts within a single lifetime. So what has the fallout been?Perhaps the starkest impact has been on our waistlines. The instinct to binge on foods rich in salt, fat and sugar kept people alive for most of human history, when the next meal was never guaranteed. Now we live in a world where calories are cheap, and where scientists devote whole careers to making foods “hyperpalatable” – which is to say far more appealing than any food found in nature. These artificial snacks interfere with the body’s ability to regulate appetite, making it very difficult to have just one crisp, or just one biscuit. Obesity, previously rare, has now overtaken malnutrition as the leading public health issue relating to diet in many parts of the world.The realm of dating (and mating) has also changed beyond all recognition. A strong drive to find the right sexual partner was indispensable when we banded together in tribes of about 150 people against an unforgiving world. But in those days, the pool of potential mates was small. Now we have devices that connect us to thousands upon thousands of them. As a result, the process often becomes protracted and overwhelming – a phase of life characterised by choice paralysis, hurtful behaviour such as ghosting, and the constant anxiety that our true soulmate is just a swipe away.In the same way that hyperpalatable foods exploit our ancient appetites, AI-driven tools such as ChatGPT have begun to exploit our deep desire for meaningRising rates of depression and other mental health problems can also be viewed through the lens of mismatch. Hunter-gatherer life involved constant companionship, hands-on work that was immediately rewarding (such as finding food or building shelter), and communities rich with tradition, ritual and spiritual meaning. Modern technology now makes most of these things optional, rather than essential. As a consequence many of us are living a life disconnected from others, lacking in fulfilling work and devoid of meaning. Seen in this context, low mood is not the misfiring of a broken brain, but a signal that we might be missing out on important aspects of human experience.To deal with these gaps, some of us turn back to technology. In the same way that hyperpalatable foods exploit our ancient appetites, AI-driven tools such as ChatGPT and Replika have begun to exploit our deep desire for meaning, as well as social and romantic connection. AI companies themselves have beensurprisedby the extent to which people become emotionally attached to their products. Andreportsare emerging that chatbots can fuel the delusions and paranoid thinking of people vulnerable to psychosis.None of this is to say that the right path for humanity is to attempt to return to the distant past. Hunter-gatherers did not live in utopian harmony like the Na’vi in Avatar. Rather, I am suggesting that there is a powerful explanation for many of our current physical and mental difficulties, and it’s that the world has developed in ways our biology hasn’t been able to keep up with. If you don’t take this into account as you look at your own life, instead expecting yourself to perform like some kind of highly optimised machine, you open the door to profound self-criticism and resentment. The frustration of not being able to lose weight, the emptiness of the job you were always told to want, the loneliness of modern cities – these can all feel like individual failures.Conversely, understanding the life we evolved for allows us to look at our problems with more clarity and self-compassion, and can nudge us towards better, more informed decisions. Rather than berating ourselves for not being able to control our impulses, we can see them through the lens of mismatch and start to think about helpful mitigations. Some solutions are straightforward, like keeping junk food out of the house, deleting social media apps or limiting screen time.Others are more complex, and require stepping back to see the bigger picture. Community, collaborative problem-solving, ritual and meaning are vital ingredients for a satisfying life and will remain so, whatever technology we invent or cultural trends bubble up. Thinking about how to build these into our lives so that they’re part of its fabric, rather than optional extras, is a potentially life-changing exercise. Not because there’s anything wrong with us – but because we find ourselves in strange times.Dr Alex Curmi is a psychiatrist, psychotherapist in training and presenter ofThe Thinking Mindpodcast.Further readingThe Social Brain: The Psychology of Successful Groupsby Tracey Camilleri, Samantha Rockey and Robin Dunbar (Penguin, £10.99)The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating by David M Buss (Basic, £16.99)Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst by Robert Sapolsky (Vintage, £12.99)Explore more on these topicsEvolutionThe big ideaPsychologyAnthropologyBiologyMental healthHealth & wellbeingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Stopping at a table of new novels, she noticed a couple with Mantel’s endorsement on the cover, which, she tells me, she generally regards as instantly justifying the book’s price. This time, though, “I suddenly thought there aren’t going to be many more of these. It was such a sad moment. We’re not going to get another Mantel book, and we’re also not going to get to know about the books that she read and loved.”To many readers who gobbled up Mantel’s books – 17 of them, including the novelBeyond Black, and theWolf Hall trilogy, which won two Booker prizes – it’s extraordinary that she found time or energy for anything beside the mammoth research that her vast historical enterprises entailed, not to mention her enthusiastic and detailed involvement in their various adaptations. But Mantel was an engaged and enthusiastic supporter of other writers, especially those in the crucial early stages of their careers. Perhaps she never forgot how long it took her to see the first novel she wrote,A Place of Greater Safety, finally emerge in print in 1992.It’s fitting, then, that the award inaugurated in her name, the Hilary Mantel prize for fiction, should focus on recognising such promise. A panel of five judges, chaired by O’Farrell, will assess 15,000 words of a novel in progress, and both winner and runner-up will receive not only money, but mentoring from Mantel’s literary agency, AM Heath; the publishing house John Murray; and the creative writing charityArvon. O’Farrell is joined by Mantel’s editor of 20 years, Nicholas Pearson; actor Ben Miles, who played Thomas Cromwell in the stage versions of the Wolf Hall trilogy; and novelists Chigozie Obioma and Chetna Maroo, who both had their debut novels shortlisted for the Booker prize.Numerous writers attest to the difference Mantel’s support made, especially early in their careersWhen it comes to first-time writers, Mantel understood that this kind of support is crucial, says O’Farrell. “Someone saying: ‘This is good, keep going, we want to see how you finish it.’ I think it will make an enormous difference.”Numerous writers attest to the difference it did make. Jessie Burton, author ofThe Miniaturist, remembers a letter she received at the beginning of her publishing life: “In early 2014, [Mantel] wrote such a warm note in her amazing handwriting, which I have framed by my dressing table.” She remembers “being astonished because she was, and is, my literary hero. A few years later, she wrote to me again, to say it was ‘a treat to see you flourish’.”Miles sees the prize as the perfect way to celebrate Mantel’s contribution to literature and to the lives of other writers and artists. “It’s a great way to honour her memory, and to cause me to recall how lucky I was meeting her, working with her and ultimately writing with her,” he told me. “It was a rare, rare thing, and something I’ll treasure all my life.” Mantel and Miles collaborated to write the stage play of the final part of the trilogy,The Mirror and the Light, and on abook of photographywith Miles’s brother, George, which was the last work Mantel published before she died.“She adored talking to young writers,” Miles remembers. When they were working on the stage plays, “you’d see the cast of actors not quite know how to approach Hilary. Some were huge fans. Some had heard of her, but hadn’t read the books. But she was such a wonderful presence in any room, and over the weeks, the actors would feel that they could approach her more and talk to her about the work. Occasionally, one of the actors would mention something that they were writing, be it a TV series or a novel or a book about rhetoric for actors and directors. And Hilary would say, ‘Show me, let me see.’ She was such a collaborator.”Thebook about rhetoricwas co-written by director Philip Wilson and the actor Giles Taylor, who played Archbishop Cranmer in the stage version of The Mirror and the Light. “We became good friends,” Taylor says, “and I introduced her to the children’s mentoring charityScene & Heard, in which inner-city kids write short plays for non-human characters, which are performed and directed by professionals. The children’s words are not edited or changed in any way, and their writing is constantly funny, surprising and compelling. Hilary, of course, loved it. As soon as the performance was over she marched up to the artistic director and demanded to be a patron, which she duly became. Within a month of getting involved she had personally rung the then culture secretary and insisted he came along, which he did. Nobody turned down the redoubtable dame.”That openness to other people’s work went both ways: Miles also recalls Mantel sending him and his brother extracts from The Mirror and the Light as she was writing it. “And it was really hard not to gush,” he laughs. “But it was a genuine question; she wanted to know what we thought of what she was doing.”Mantel was straightforward about her abilities and her ambitions. Possibly she felt false modesty to be a form of inverted vanity, and she was highly attuned to the challenges of creating her fictional worlds and to the intense effort – intellectual, emotional, logistical – that each project demanded. But although she might occasionally have tended towards the aphoristic, even her pithiest advice opened up horizons. “If you don’t mean your words to breed consequences,” she wrote in a piece forthe Guardian, “don’t write at all; the only tip you can give to a prospective writer is: ‘Try to mean what you say.’” In practice, meaning what you say is harder than it looks, and Mantel’s work was an extended elaboration of how it is done. In her 2017 Reith Lectures, she said: “In time, I understood one thing; that you don’t become a novelist to become a spinner of entertaining lies, you become a novelist so you can tell the truth.”With this prize comes another chance for Mantel’s generosity and her lifelong commitment to the power of literature to make itself felt. “By writing a novel one performs a revolutionary act,” she once wrote. “A novel is an act of hope. It allows us to imagine that things may be other than they are.”The Hilary Mantel prize for fiction will be open to unpublished writers living in the UK and Irelandfrom Monday to 31 December 2025, and will be awarded in spring 2026.

His son Nick and daughter-in-law Lise have been constantly at his side and John died peacefully in hospital this morning.”Stapleton’s formerGMTVco-presenter Kate Garraway said she was “absolutely devastated to hear of the passing of my dear friend and journalistic hero”, describing him as a “rock solid broadcaster and the ultimate gentleman”.Charlotte Hawkins and Susanna Reid, fellow presenters of Good Morning Britain, also paid tribute. Reid described Stapleton as a “legend” and “consummate pro” who was “always good-humoured and gracious to work with”. Hawkins said he was a “brilliant broadcaster” and a “genuinely lovely man”.Nick Stapleton posted on Instagram that his father had not been happy living with Parkinson’s. He added: “It turns out he got what he wanted – to leave us on his terms, without suffering. Living independently and still doing the things he loved until almost the very end. I’m sad for me and my wife … but I’m happy for him.”Stapleton was a fan of Manchester City, who said in a post on X they were “saddened to learn” of his death. Nick said that when he and his father “watched them win the Champions League in Istanbul he turned to me and said he’d die happy. He meant it.”Stapleton, a presenter for Newsnight, Watchdog and GMTV’s News Hour,revealed his diagnosis with Parkinson’s diseasein October 2024.Appearing on ITV’s Good Morning Britain after announcing his diagnosis, he said: “There’s no point in being miserable … It won’t ever change. Parkinson’s is here with me now for the rest of my life. Best I can do is try and control it and take the advice of all the experts.”Stapleton was born in Oldham and began his working life as a trainee reporter in the north-west, before moving into television as a presenter on the BBC’s Nationwide and then forNewsnight, where he reported on conflicts around the world.He became a household name after moving into the world of light entertainment and consumer affairs. He presented the BBC’s Watchdog programme between 1985 and 1993 alongside his wife,Lynn Faulds Wood, who died in 2020.Watchdog was renowned for exposing shoddy workmanship and illegal working practices, with the team often confronting business owners.View image in fullscreenStapleton with Kirsty Wark and Jill Dando, fellow presenters of the BBC’s Breakfast Time programme, in 1988.Photograph: David Crump/Daily Mail/ShutterstockIn 2002, Stapleton found himself having a conversation with police officers after a segment on GMTV when a reporter was sent out to see how quickly they could acquire some cannabis in south London.After Stapleton showed the drugs on GMTV, some viewers complained and the police interviewed him, despite the fact he had made it clear thecannabis was to be destroyed immediatelyafter the show.Stapleton said: “I got a message down my earpiece from the producer that there had been a complaint and there was a Metropolitan police officer waiting to see me. I thought she was joking at first but a charming lady inspector was waiting on the studio floor and we had a little chat. She wanted to know how it came into my possession and that was it.”Stapleton was also part of the presenting team, alongside Sir Trevor McDonald and Roger Cook, for Carlton Television’scontroversial debate in 1997 about the monarchy, in which members of the public gave their views on the future of the royal family.The show, which was filmed at Birmingham’s National Exhibition Centre and included audible booing from the audience, who also heckled panellists, was described by the journalist Sir Robin Day as “the most contemptible programme I have ever watched”.Steve Clark, Carlton’s head of factual programmes at the time, defended the boisterous debate, asking: “Is the standard of debate in the House of Commons at Question Time any better than that?”It ended with a poll of 2.5 million callers, 66% of whom believed there should be a future for the monarchy.After revealing his Parkinson’s diagnosis in 2024, Stapleton went onBBCOne’s Morning Live to discuss his illness. “Speaking is how I’ve earned my living for the best part of 50 years,” he said. “It’s very frustrating sometimes, particularly [when] people are constantly saying to you: ‘Sorry, what did you say?’ And you have to repeat yourself, time and time again.“I am fairly pragmatic about the prospect of this getting worse. I try to remain positive, because what’s the point of not being?”He also partnered with Children in Need and sang a song from the musical & Juliet, after revealing that he used singing to cope with his diagnosis.Stapleton’s son, Nick, followed him into television, becoming the co-presenter of the Bafta-winning BBC daytime series Scam Interceptors.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionFactual TVBBCNewsnightGMTVnewsShareReuse this content"

With a husband who never listens, a hormonal daughter and a son refusing to grant her – even when she’s on the loo – a moment’s peace, Manito is reporting back from the frontline of unglamorous family life. And she fashions from it effective standup too, even if it starts to feels one-note, and resists our host’s efforts, never very convincing, to shape it into more than the sum of its parts.Those parts can be effective as stand-alone routines. There’s a reliably amusing number about her infant son leaving her exposed in the toilet of a Mexican restaurant. There’s a bit about easyJet’s baggage restrictions that makes up for in ardour and comic exaggeration what it lacks in originality. There are also first-base routines, like the one about sex education in the 90s, and weak punchlines, like the “space cakes” line wrapping up a section on her kids’ dressing-up days at school. I also found Manito’s scornful persona a bit two-dimensional, at least in the show’s first half, where everything is “the next load of bollocks” – like her holiday to Skegness, where “it’s windy, it’s raining, and it’s shit”.It’s a relief when we start glimpsing other sides to her, as when she sheds tears at a waxing session, or – a highlight, this – when the war in Gaza throws her chosen charity for the London marathon into embarrassing relief. By this stage, we’re getting a more rounded Manito (long-distance runner; daughter to a Lebanese dad fretting about the Middle East, and a mum developing a taste for medicinal cannabis) in place of the middle-aged grouch caricature. We get some vivid material, too. But it comes at you in scattershot fashion, with many an apropos-of-nothing segue and with Manito’s various stabs at making the show cohere (is it about the so-called “sandwich generation”? is it about her attempt to “improve her reputation”?) never quite coalescing.AtFarnham Maltings, 24 September.

Directors are best off ignoring the Friar’s observation “they stumble that run fast” and Ellie Hurt rightly puts pedal to the metal in her vigorous production. Not for nothing is Zoe West’s Romeo wearing Nike trainers.The first act is breathtaking, the adrenaline sustained right from the opening brawl through to the Capulets’ ball. Romeo’s reflections on Rosaline with Benvolio (Kelise Gordon-Harrison) are fizzier than usual; the Nurse (Ebony Feare) is hurried out of giving her lament for Susan; and instead of trying to calm tempers, Joe Alessi’s hard-nut Capulet is ready to glass Tybalt (Milo McCarthy) with a bottle of bubbly. As the party rages, Mercutio (Elliot Broadfoot) grabs the mic to reprise lines from the Queen Mab speech like it’s a dance anthem, Mab’s drumming of a soldier’s ear turned into clubby beats.View image in fullscreenEnthralling … Kelise Gordon-Harrison and Elliot Broadfoot.Photograph: Pamela RaithWhen Juliet (Alicia Forde) and Romeo find themselves alone together, everything grinds to a halt and the stage at last falls silent. Their shared sonnet is delivered tenderly yet with a wholly realistic adolescent awkwardness. Teenage viewers who find the delicate wooing of rhyming couplets unrelatable may take heart from this Romeo’s drunken belch beforehand – and recognise the mutual blushes and hesitant touches that follow. Then the giddiness of their first kiss propels the play onwards again, with a beautifully managed balcony scene fired by nervous excitement. There’s a fresh realism given, too, to Romeo’s discovery of his new love’s identity: “Is she a Capulet? Oh for fuck’s sake!”View image in fullscreenDeluded … Milo McCarthy as Paris, right, with Joe Alessi as Capulet.Photograph: Pamela RaithThe streamlined text and dramaturgy by Tommo Fowler add to the pace, as do Dom Coyote’s compelling music and Sascha Gilmour’s unfussy, split-level set. The first prologue takes place as if in the tomb, the cast forming a chorus who carry vials, and the lovers’ death bed remains on stage throughout. The usual extraneous characters and speeches are excised (alas poor Balthasar!) but so too are the roles of Lady Capulet and Romeo’s parents altogether. Those are somewhat compensated by the Nurse and the Friar but you lose a sense of broader familial tragedy, as well as the elder generation’s implication in the cycle of violence. The slashed dramatis personae also reduces the effect of bustling households at war.The violence, sometimes accompanied by KJ’s strobe lighting, needs a little more edge although it is an inspired move to intercut Tybalt and Mercutio’s deaths with Juliet’s forceful “Gallop apace” soliloquy for added dynamism. This Tybalt is not an outlandish Prince of Cats but seems grimly committed to an inherited hatred he does not fully comprehend. McCarthy doubles as a dim, deluded Paris while Alessi makes a callous Capulet (given many of his absent wife’s lines) who is dripped in bling and overly concerned with status. The care for these young lovers comes from Feare’s playful Nurse and the practical Friar (Eithne Browne) as well as a soothing chorus who repurpose phrases from speeches into song lyrics.Hurt’s timings are on point until the end, as Juliet awakes to see Romeo’s drugs take hold – a scene that brings to bear all of the vulnerability and devotion in West and Forde’s performances throughout. They’re a dream pairing in an often enthralling, intelligent and accessible show.AtEveryman theatre, Liverpool, until 4 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreRomeo and JulietEveryman theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

In life and in death, Twitch’s aura was well earned; as Optimo (Espacio), with his DJ partner JG Wilkes, Twitch’s irreverent humour, political action and renegade attitude shifted the axis of good taste on to a broader, wilder plain and inspired generations of clubbers.In the early 1990s, Twitch co-founded the Edinburgh club night Pure. With Jeff Mills’ first UK gig, he effectively (alongside Glasgow’s Rubadub) brought Detroit to Scotland, side-stepping the decade’s Madchester obsession in favour of a weirder palette of acid house and techno. When Pure ran its course, Twitch switched to Glasgow and formed Optimo (Espacio) with Wilkes in 1997 – and having had a decade of techno dominance, they decided they had other ideas.They stencilled “Optimo Sundays. You won’t like it, sugar” and “Optimo says it’s not as good as it used to be” on to flyers, positioning themselves as a honeypot for freaks. Optimo (Espacio) shoved an elbow into the club scene’s ribs, eschewing Detroit and Chicago worship for a ferociously agnostic take on genre. DJ sets had ESG’s avant-pop woven into Parliament-Funkadelic’s righteous jams, Nitzer Ebb’s EBM stompers into Donna Summer’s sensual drum machine riffs.Twitch roared through blends like a Mustang through a hot desert, fearless and determined. “It’ll work, surely it’ll work – yes, it fucking worked,” you’d think when he pulled it off, and he rarely fumbled. You can hear that skill and vision on countless mixes. Today, multigenre DJ mixes are familiar to the point of being standard, but when Optimo’s double CD How to Kill the DJ (Part 2) dropped in 2004, in a scene dominated by seamless European minimal house, its influence was a mushroom cloud. Barring 2manydj’s As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt 2, How to Kill the DJ (Part 2) – which blended Nurse with Wound into Blondie, for example – stands out as that era’s boldest DJ effort to bring rockers and ravers together.View image in fullscreenJD Twitch (right), with Optimo partner JG Wilkes.Photograph: PRTheir most impactful trick, though, was how they structured their Glasgow parties, with DJ sets before and after live acts. The Rapture played in 2002, which fuelled an appetite for DFA Records and gave clubbers permission to dance to indie bands, sparking possibilities; Alex Kapranos was often in the crowd, and has spoken aboutOptimo’s influence on his band, Franz Ferdinand. LCD Soundsystem’s performances and Twitch’s push of their music came full circle with the news of Twitch’s illness: DFA printed a run of T-shirts to raise money for his hospice care that read “No DFA without Optimo”, and rightly so.McIvor had a bear-hug that made everything all right, a reassuring bellow and a natural inquisitiveness that made you feel remembered. The latter extended beyond his close circle, as he weaved his politics unabashedly in his work. Pure was founded in the shadow of rampant football violence, and he made great efforts to cultivate an anti-sectarian atmosphere at the party.He campaigned for anti-racist causes and Scottish independence. Optimo’s own record label released compilations such as Against Fascism Trax and Anarcho Disco, which funded donations to groups such as Hope Not Hate, and his DJ fees and label funds were often given to food banks. In a dance music culture obsessed with statement-making career moves, with showboating flourishes designed to do numbers on social media or live streams, McIvor built his own rep on playing thousands of sets, and by being a sincere champion of the underdog until the end.Optimo Boiler Room x AVA Festival DJ SetWhen grieving for someone, hearing a piece of music can whip you back into a particular time and place with them, and it will be McIvor’s legacy that so many songs will do that. On the final Optimo (Espacio) Sunday in 2010, the duo blasted Dinosaur’s Kiss Me Again, the Joubert Singers’ Stand on the Word and Jefferson Airplane’s White Rabbit with equal fervour.When they closed Sónar By Day in 2017 with Slayer’s Reign in Blood, the sangria-soaked masses leapt up in astonishment, and whenever they dropped Motörhead’s Ace of Spades they sent ravers into headbanger mode.On the 20th anniversary of Optimo (Espacio) in Glasgow, they played the 12-inch extended version of Bronski Beat’s Smalltown Boy and, when it built to crescendo, they made the tender power of Jimmy Somerville’s voice feel like a 10-ton truck rolling through the room.In Fran Lebowitz’s 2021 TV series Pretend It’s a City, the New York writer argued that her job was to somehow justify artists to the public; that there must be a reason, a root, for why someone comes along and is more brilliant than others. But sometimes, she says, talent just falls out of the sky and lands on someone – it’s what they want to do with it that counts. In his wild, big-hearted life, McIvor made it count.Explore more on these topicsClub cultureDance musicPunkElectronic musiccommentShareReuse this content"

But the multi-flooredCampanelledoesn’t deign to open at weekends (for now, anyway), because, well, why bother? Who would go? Mind you, on the Friday lunchtime when I stepped into this elegant, all-day brasserie in a Grade II-listed building that was once home to the London Shipping Exchange, the whole place was empty, save for a flurry of diligent, all-female staff. Friday, it seems, is also not a busy day in the City.Campanelle’s à la carte menu is similarly sparse, and oddly uninspiring. It offers the likes of lobster linguine, breaded veal cutletsalla Milaneseand Amalfi lemon tart, and claims to be influenced by the whole of Italy. At breakfast, however, it serves buttermilk chicken waffles and cornbread with organic nama yasai berry jam, though, curiously, not much in the way of fine Italian pastries or coffee.View image in fullscreenWhile Campanelle’s breakfast menu does feature tomato and ’nduja bruschetta, it also offers the rather less Italian likes of buttermilk chicken waffles.Restaurants of this kind, which are apparently designed to take money from people with money, tend to drill down on one specific region – let’s say Puglia – before creating an intricate, often fictitious backstory about how Puglia is sealed in the chef/patron’s heart via hisnonnain the Foggia mountains. Not so here, however; they haven’t even bothered with a ChatGPT-generated yarn. Instead, there’s just a short list ofantipasti,frittiand pastas, as well aspesceandcarnethat’s reportedly cooked on a charcoal grill, although during my visit I sniffed not a whiff of smoke in the air. Furthermore, Campanelle’s menu makes no claims that itscapelli d’angelo(angel-hair pasta) or linguine are handmade, even though a main course serving of pasta carbonara and a painfully lacklustre beef shin ragu fettuccine both come in at £26. That ragu, by the way, was in such dire need of seasoning that even a humble Oxo cube would have worked wonders.My starter of langoustine arancini turned out to be the highlight of the entire meal: two plump, hot, crisp balls of breaded al dente risotto rice, generous with the shellfish and with a real kick of chilli. They came perched on puddles of what was little more than a glorified mayo, but they were satisfying nevertheless. By comparison, the angel hair pasta with baby ceps was a sadly rudimentary affair that tasted mainly of garlic and field mushrooms.Alone in my quiet restaurant hell, my solitude was soothed by the arrival of another diner, a forlorn, hedge-fund manager sort who mooched in for his reservation for two while cursing the secretary who had scheduled a Friday lunchtime client meeting. After that, a few sombre-looking groups took up some of the other tables in this corporate-facing and not-very-Italian-at-all restaurant. These were clearly work teams who at some point had agreed it would be “great to get together and grab a bite”, and now here they were of a Friday afternoon, grabbing that very bite, without wine, in a stiff City restaurant while sitting elbow to elbow with people they had nothing in common with other than matching security lanyards. Campanelle is a great illustration of the pros of working from home.View image in fullscreen‘Oddly uninspiring’: Campanelle’s native lobster linguine.The whole “let’s get back to the office” brigade should be condemned in the afterlife to spend eternity in an upscale, business-lunch restaurant of this sort. Just as they are at Campanelle, the banquettes will be comfy, the light fittings expensive, the air-conditioning cool and the wine list impressive, but each plate of crab salad with smoked celeriac will be accompanied by the terror of hearing Julie from Rushmore Infinity Brokers’ faltering anecdote about her cockapoo, while her colleagues quietly die inside.The tiramisu, you might at this stage be unsurprised to learn, is not an authentic, multi-layered slice of semi-orderly, cocoa-encrusted stodge. Rather, it is a neatly stacked, precise and pretty tiramisu that’s plated as if it’s off to Royal Ascot on top of someone’s head. Call me old-fashioned, but I like my tiramisu scooped from a bowl and hitting my plate with a wobbly splat; I also want a blast of amaretto so strong that it grows hairs on my face. What I don’t want is a tiramisu I can eat between meals, like a 1970s Milky Way bar, without ruining my appetite.View image in fullscreen‘Plated as if it’s off to Royal Ascot on top of someone’s head’: Campanelle’s tiramisu.Campanelle is a restaurant for people who don’t want to go to lunch, but absolutely have to, mainly because they are contractually obliged to entertain clients. If you are one of those people, the nicest thing to be said for this place is that it’s close both to the office and to several mainline train stations, and that the bill is far easier to get through corporate accounts than the nearbyJason AthertonandGordon Ramsayplaces. Other than that, this is definitely notla bella vita.Campanelle19-21 Billiter Street, London EC3, 0203-745 0909. Open Mon-Fri 7.30am-9.30pm.

Food styling: Lucy-Ruth Hathaway.Felicity Cloake's masterclassDessertHow to make lemon sorbet – recipeThe ultimate feel-good dessert in nine simple stepsFelicity CloakeSun 21 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareIwon’t pretend that these are the height of Italian fashion, but style is eternal – as is the childish joy of a bright yellow frozen lemon. You could, of course, buy in lemon sorbet instead, and use the flesh from the lemon shells for cocktails or lemonade (and/or freeze the juice for future use), but this really is such an easy make-ahead dessert that I urge you to give it a go.Prep25 minCook5 minFreeze4 hr 30 min+Serves4115g white sugar1 unwaxed lemon(organic lemons are never waxed)4 large lemonsA pinch of salt1 tbsp vodka, or gin or similar (optional)1 A note on the lemonsLook for large, handsome lemons – as the season proper gets underway in southern Europe, there will be increasing amounts of choice, which means this is a recipe to bookmark for the winter (assuming you don’t want to make it for pudding this evening). Make sure you get at least one unwaxed fruit, albeit of any size, because you need it for its zest.2 A note on the syrupStart by making a syrup, which may seem a faff, but it will help dissolve the sugar without you having to heat the lemon juice and so dull its flavour. White sugar is preferable colour-wise, while golden is fine; brown, however, will change the taste of the sorbet. Put the sugar in a small pan with 75ml water.3 Make the syrupView image in fullscreenFinely grate the zest of the unwaxed lemon into the sugar pan, then set it over a medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Take off the heat and leave to cool completely. (Minus the lemon zest, this is also how you make simple syrup for cocktails.)4 Prep the lemonsCarefully trim the bases off the four remaining lemons, so they will sit flat on a work surface, then cut off the tops about a quarter of the way down – these will be the sorbets’ lids later. Use a small, preferably serrated knife (a grapefruit knife is ideal, if you have one; a pointed teaspoon might also come in useful for cleaning the shells) carefully to cut out all the flesh inside the lemons.View image in fullscreen5 Collect the juiceRoughly chop the lemon flesh, then press it through a fine sieve to capture every last drop of juice (I use my hands). Gently squeeze the hollow shells and lids, too, to free any remaining juice from them. Juice the zested lemon, too, then pour all the juice into a measuring jug: you should have about 300ml in total, but don’t worry about being too exact.6 Flavour the sorbetStir a pinch of salt and the optional alcohol into the lemon juice (though you can certainly leave it out, the booze does help improve the texture of the sorbet); if you’re using limoncello or similar, add a little more to make up for its lower alcohol content. You could also at this stage add finely chopped fresh mint or basil leaves.View image in fullscreen7 Finish the sorbet baseAdd equal amounts of syrup and cold water to the juice mixture, 25ml at a time in total, and taste after each addition, until the mix is to your liking – remember that freezing will mute the flavour slightly, so it should be really quite intense. Even so, depending on the lemons and your palate, you might not need all the syrup.8 Freeze and/or churnFreeze and churn in an ice-cream maker. If you don’t have an ice-cream maker, pour the sorbet into a sturdy, freezer-proof box that’s large enough to hold it in a fairly shallow layer, then freeze for about 90 minutes, until it’s starting to go solid around the edges. Use a fork, whisk or food processor vigorously to beat the mix to an icy slush, then return to the freezer and repeat the freeze and whisk at least twice more.9 Finishing touchesView image in fullscreenOnce the sorbet is firm, scoop it into the reserved lemon shells, filling them generously so it spills out a bit. Top each with a lid, stand on a baking tray and freeze again until you’re ready to eat. The sorbets are best consumed soon after making, but they should keep well for up to a week (and, though the texture will deteriorate, they will still be delicious for much longer).Explore more on these topicsDessertFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodFruitItalian food and drinkIce-cream and sorbetfeaturesShareReuse this content"
