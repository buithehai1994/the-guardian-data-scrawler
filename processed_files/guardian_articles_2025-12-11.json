Where on earth is parliament?John CraceYou’d think MPs would be lining up to decry the US president’s support for far-right nationalists. Instead, only backbenchers and a few junior ministers bothered to turn upThu 11 Dec 2025 11.56 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 15.13 ESTShare’Twas the fortnight before Christmas and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. Apart from a few exceptions. The Labour backbencher Matt Western had managed to secure an urgent question onPresident Trump’s new national security strategyand the Commons itself was remarkable for its absences. A roll-call of dishonour.Take Nigel Farage. You would have thought he would have had a lot to say on the subject. After all, when Barack Obama had intervened in the Brexit referendum campaign to say the UK would be atthe back of the queue for any trade deal with the US, Nige had been outraged. How dare the president try to interfere with the democratic processes of another sovereign country? So now that Donald Trump was threatening to do much the same thing in countries all across Europe, surely this was the time for Nige to make a stand. This was surely a point of principle for him. Were he to have any.US engaging in ‘extreme rightwing tropes’ reminiscent of 1930s, British MPs warnRead moreThat’s not all. You’d also expect Farage to have a thing or two to say about The Donald’s admiration for all things Russia. A possible sellout of Ukraine. Because Nige has always got very angry when people point out that, back in 2014, he had said thatUkraine had got what was coming when Vladimir Putin invaded Crimea. The Ukrainians should never have expressed a desire to join Nato. I never meant to say that, he sobbed. The words had just come out wrong. And as for Nathan Gill, the former Reform leader in Wales, getting a10-year stretch for taking money from the Russians, Nige had been shocked – SHOCKED – that a close associate could have done such a thing. Here was a moment of redemption.Then there was the explicit racism of Trump’s security strategy. The charming predictions of “civilisational erasure”. A known rightwing racist trope. The wrong sort of people gaining ascendancy. Brown and black people. Now we know that Nige finds all racism abhorrent. We know it, because he has said so frequently in the last few weeks.Especially when confronted with the evidence of 28 boys with whom he was at school. They must all have slipped down a wormhole where their memories had been erased, he said. And besides, what’s wrong with a bit of banter? Make your mind up, Nige.View image in fullscreenFarage did not appear to denounce the explicit racism of Trump’s security strategy. Maybe he had important constituency business in Clacton.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianSo for all these reasons, you’d have expected Farage to bust a gut to get to the Commons. To stand up for democracy and his own integrity. But he was nowhere to be seen. Now to be fair, it’s possible he had important constituency business in Clacton – there’s a first time for everything – but surely he might have sent along one of his trusty sidekicks. Dicky, Lee, Danny or Sarah. But no. Not one of them bothered to show their faces. When it’s a president whose favours you crave, then all bets are off. When it comes to the national interest or the personal interest, the latter wins hands down.Reform wasn’t alone in its cowardice. Kemi Badenoch, that proud defender of British democracy, was also nowhere to be seen. Nor indeed were any of her shadow cabinet. Instead it was left to Mike Wood, a shadow junior minister of such little importance that even he doesn’t have a clue what his job is meant to be, to speak for the Tory party.In what may well be a first and last outing at the dispatch box for an urgent question, Mike managed to completely miss the point. At first he didn’t even seem to have grasped that the question was about the US security strategy. Instead he waffled on about the Tories promising to increase defence spending to 3%. No wonder the few MPs that were in the chamber looked baffled. And then when he did get to the strategy, he offered the remarkable observation that it was really all about China. People who were concerned about Russia were being neurotically conspiratorial. Almost as though the Tories were also going out of their way to appease The Donald.Not to be left out, theLabourfrontbench were also guilty of being absent without leave. Western’s urgent question had originally been directed at the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, but Darren Jones was nowhere to be seen. So the short straw went to Seema Malhotra, the lowest-ranked minister in the Foreign Office, to do the honours for the government. She looked miserable throughout.Malhotra began by saying the US-UK relationship was tickety-boo. There were lots of really good, exciting things to be found in the US strategy. The Donald was an amazing guy. Ravishingly good looking and the sharpest mind on the planet. He and Keir Starmer were the perfect pairing.Then a few caveats. All done in a mumble. Hoping that no one in the US embassy was listening and would report back to the president. We did have a slightly different perspective on some things, she said almost inaudibly. But then again, too few to mention. It took a while but after a bit of pressing, she got round to saying that Sadiq Khan was doing a decent job. Though the president hadn’t in any way been racist in calling him a horrible, disgusting man. Would this do? Could she sit down now?It was left to Western himself, with contributions from the Labour MPs Chi Onwurah, Liam Byrne and the Lib Dems Calum Miller and Bobby Dean to get to the heart of the matter: there was nothing remotely normal about the US security strategy. It was all there in black and white. A threat to destabilise European democracies. Support for far-right nationalists. Withdrawal from Nato. Support for Russia. It was a moment of existential crisis forEurope. It was time to wake up. When the US president says this stuff, you had better believe him. Just choosing to ignore it all, hoping things will work out if you don’t rock the boat was an abrogation of responsibility.At times like this, it feels as if some of our politicians are sleepwalking to disaster.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchDonald TrumpEuropeNigel FarageLabourReform UKConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

But his music is quite different: a slippery layer cake of samples, multitudinous keys and lo-fi pop production, with Brown singing of a world where “the ebb and flow isn’t ebbing right”, be it in love or civic life. There is still room for an instant-classic R&B ballad though, in Tossed Away.Ben Beaumont-Thomas49Rochelle Jordan – Through the WallEverything isjust soon the British Canadian producer’s sixth album: expensively plush deep house suggesting club lights low, gleaming mirrors, potent looks igniting across the dancefloor. As much as the cold beat and ballroom flow of Ladida or the slapping “body, body, body” incantations of On 2 Something suggest a steadfast commitment to abandon, Jordan maintains impeccable poise and control throughout, whether in diva mode on Words 2 Say, breaking hearts on Bite the Bait, standing up for her needs on Doing It Too (“I’m not too much / You just give too little”) or patiently waiting for a frustrated lover to see the light on Ladida. Commanding, wise and committed to atmospheric excellence, party hosts don’t come better.Laura Snapes48Jerskin Fendrix– Once Upon a Time … in ShropshireView image in fullscreenHarebrained prog cabaret … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttJerskin Fendrix’s high-profile scores for the last three Yorgos Lanthimos films can’t really help prime you for the Midlands composer’s eccentrically beautiful second album, which pairs pristine musical theatre with the harebrained prog cabaret of Faith No More and (particularly) the under-sung Morphine. At first, Once Upon a Time … casts the rural bliss of growing up in 00s Shropshire in a golden light, a haven of getting ratted on Baileys and listening to Kanye on a farm, then having a lovely hungover group breakfast in someone’s kitchen. But the unexpected deaths he has experienced in recent years intrude to spoil paradise, eliciting feverish, absurdist expressions of grief – Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle is a bravura wig-out – and fathomless devastation from his camp, craggy voice. It demands a full theatrical production.LS47Clipping– Dead Channel SkyClipping frontman Daveed Diggs is best known for being in the original cast of Hamilton, and for all that this album is filled with noisy industrial rap, you can easily imagine it being successfully adapted for the Broadway stage. Dead Channel Sky is set in a cyberpunk dystopia not dissimilar to the scorched-sun “real world” of the Matrix, humming with janky tech and populated with fascists and freaky hedonists. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes render it in acid squiggles and revving breakbeats, while Diggs delivers his mutoid poetry like a prophet jacked up on some amphetamine he’s synthesised in a backstreet lab.BBTTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more46The Tubs – Cotton CrownIn different hands,the Tubs’ second album might be a crushing listen, and understandably so. In 2014, frontman Owen Williams’ mother, the songwriter and author Charlotte Greig,died by suicide. Grief, as these songs detail, made him a rubbish boyfriend. But Cotton Crown is often funny and ardent, and especially self-aware about how new love might feel like a life raft to a depressed mind ill-equipped to reciprocate: “Know it’s all in my brain / Caught in the middle of loving you and being insane,” Williams sings on Fair Enough. His striking voice, somewhere between Richard Thompson and Bob Mould, bolts through the band’s joyful jangle-pop. Clear students of the form, they’re virtuosos with zero patience for perfection, their riffs hurtling and plundering like seagulls going at a spilled catch as they vigorously rough you up with profundity.LS45Smerz – Big City LifeView image in fullscreenAn album of stilted beauty … Smerz.Photograph: Alva Le FebvreCatharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt feel like the pop girlies of the incredibly prolific and off-kilterCopenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory scene, making music that’s more outward-facing and arch than some of their insular and traditional (and equally great) classmates. Their second album lurches between throwing yourself at life – “you’re a girl in the city and you shouldn’t think twice”, they chant in deadpan harmony on Roll the Dice – and actually thinking twice quite a lot in existential spirals about purpose and desire. The dissonance between confidence and anxiety comes through in the album’s stilted beauty: one minute, their whorls of prepared piano carry you along like clouds amid perfectly turned pop-R&B and balladry; then they stab and stutter, like cracks in the pavement destined to trap your heels. In 2023, K-pop’s brightest hopes NewJeans hired them as co-writers: more pop bearing their imprint can only be a good thing.LS44Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendReleased almost exactly a year after her superstar-minting breakthrough Short n’ Sweet, and using a palette of soft rock, 80s pop, light disco and yearning country melodies, Carpenter added rich colour to one of pop’s most distinctive self-portraits. Her blatant sexuality is offset by an ironising sense of camp and a deep streak of cynicism, as she wonders whether to wrap her little finger round a series of hot but useless men. But whether dialling her exes while hopped up on “go-go juice” or being toxic for the sport of it (“you think that I’m gonna fuck with your head / well, you’re absolutely right”), Carpenter knows she’s part of the problem. Her fake helplessness at her own worst impulses is just one part of a formidable screwball comedy arsenal – she’s a Rosalind Russell for the dating app era.BBT43Jennifer Walton – DaughtersView image in fullscreenBolt from the blue … Jennifer Walton.Photograph: Liam CosfordThis Sunderland producer’s previous work included one EP of power electronics, one of antic club tracks, collabs with Aya and 96 Back as Microplastics, gigging with Kero Kero Bonito and a smattering of other credits. So her staggering, fully formed songwriterly debut was a total bolt from the blue. A swarming orchestral epic with shades of Julia Holter and Phil Elverum, it addressed her grief for her late father in serenely surrealist images – hitting a deer with a car in the middle of the night – and the painfully mundane realism of sitting in hospital corridors together. The standout Miss America combined both to stunning effect, a numbed incantation of everything Walton had seen on the US trip where she learned of her father’s diagnosis, the familiar now remade horribly mythic.LS42Erika de Casier– LifetimeErika de Casier’s fourth album updates the Y2K R&B template that fought for body-to-body sensuality in the face of rising digital creep. The old-school dial tones that pierce Lifetime’s rapt, liquid atmosphere work both as Janet homage and ironic sigh at how good those forebears had it when emotional warfare could only be conducted via pager: “Took a screenshot so / I could look at your pretty face all the time now / Without a sign that I’m online,” de Casier sings on earworm Delusional, a low-slung anthem for contemporary dating anxiety. “Hit midnight / Not even a text to hold me warm,” she rues on The Chase. That’s one of the most inviting things about Lifetime: its seductively cool surfaces conceal de Casier frantically kicking her feet below the surface, just like the rest of us.LS41Danny Brown – StardustThe Detroit rapper’s first post-rehab record totally disprovedhis fearsthat sobriety makes artists boring. On Stardust, Brown is still hard-wired with cartoonish verve, coupled with a genuinely touching sense of gratitude: “Sleeping real good at night ’cos I’m proud of myself,” he raps on Book of Daniel. While you probably wouldn’t describe someone who ponders “going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” as a wise elder, his hunger for life, opportunity and unmediated sensation blares through in how evidently gagged he is to centre younger producers from the digicore and hyperpop undergrounds: his unruly kids 8485, Jane Remover, Underscores, Frost Children and more make Stardust trip with glitch, rave, squealing riffs and overdriven noise. The rare record that makes you want to riot and shed a smiling single tear emoji.LS40-3140YHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsView image in fullscreenChews you up … YHWH Nailgun.Photograph: Steve GullickIn 21 minutes, the New York band’s debut chews you up and spits you out the other side in a tentacular whirr of rototoms, guitars that shriek and whine like neglected machinery, erratic tempos and frontman Zack Borzone’s choked-out vocals. The way the record lurches and reels brings to mind the classic horror film scene in which a human undergoes a violent, magnificent transformation into some sort of beast: much like Gilla Band’s Most Normal, 45 Pounds is a font of mutant rock pleasures.LS39Sudan Archives – The BPMThe title refers to the beats per minute of dance music, but for an album that is so totally alive, it surely also refers to a pounding heart. Sudan Archives (AKA Angeleno producer-singer-songwriter-violinist Brittney Parks) announces that “life’s a game and I got VR goggles” as she revels in the epicurean joys of sex, dancing, travel and music itself with an almost superhuman appetite: “The rest are cowards / They choose to eat and we devour.” It’s all done with breezy good humour but there’s something inspiring, even quietly political about this mindful rejection of the straight life. Her backings – full of pop-R&B and ethereal electro – also dart away from obvious mainstream paths.BBT38Ethel Cain – Willoughby Tucker, I’ll Always Love YouView image in fullscreenRomantic slowcore … Ethel Cain.Photograph: Dollie KyarnIt’s easy to see why US singer-songwriter Cain has become so adored. This album further sketches out the kind of storytelling universe that attracts footnote-writing fandoms: it’s a prequel to the events of her debut album Preacher’s Daughter, deepening the tale of Ethel and a cast of young peers as they fumble towards connection and understanding. Her moody, romantic slowcore is also perfect music for listening to on headphones as you walk around boring suburban streets wishing you could leave for bigger things. It’s also great for road trips: songs between five and 15 minutes that seem to make a long, slow blur of the pell-mell world outside.BBT37Olivia Dean – The Art of LovingThe British breakthrough of the year, as Dean – already doing decent business with her pleasant but rather neat debut Messy – reached a completely new level of songcraft. Bossa nova, folk and soul (classic and neo) are warmed together with beautiful production, evaporating any sense of pastiche to make a sound that’s both easy on the ear but distinctly Dean’s. Every song has a superb top line, Dean stretching them into loose jazzy shapes (Let Alone the One You Love, Lady Lady) or tightening them into brisk pop (Man I Need, Something Inbetween). But it’s the lyrics that make these songs so red-blooded: every stage of love, from the first flutter of flirtation to the adrenal shock of rejection, is made so true to life.BBT36Anna von Hausswolff – IconoclastsView image in fullscreenSense of awe … Anna von Hausswolff.Photograph: Philip SvenssonAnna von Hausswolff is no stranger to a monumental statement: her primary instrument is the pipe organ,a towering edifice of tin and arsenicthat offers her an ever-renewing sense of awe. But the Swedish composer’s sixth album goes bigger than ever, grappling with mortality, transcendence and evil in a series of stormy epics that also lash a little pop structure to her prow. “Oh, I’m breaking up with language / Oh, in search of something bigger than this,” she screams on Stardust, an exhilarating co-pilot on the path to absolution.LS35Bon Iver – Sable, FableIf, as Justin Vernon recently suggested, this is the last ever Bon Iver album, it’s a beautiful redemption arc: a loving send-up of his anxious, myopic sad-sack self blossoms into a radiant appreciation of possibility, sensuality, risk. Everything Is Peaceful Love has one of the year’s best refrains: “Damn if I’m not climbing up a tree right now!”, giddy with thrill and absolutely no idea of what to do when you get up there other than enjoy the view. And while there are gorgeously passionate songs here, it’s the ones about gracefully letting go of an unviable love that really underscore the admirable humility in Vernon’s bowing out.LS34Snocaps – SnocapsKatie Crutchfield’s full-throated transformation into country doyenne on her last couple of albums as Waxahatchee almost makes it easy to forget her indie-rock origins. Fourteen years since she and twin sister Allison wound down their teen band PS Eliot, the DIY stalwarts got back together – with a little help from MJ Lenderman and producer Brad Cook – and went back to brass tacks for their surprise album as Snocaps. What a treat it was: full of punchy indignation – “I could never just …coast!” they exclaim on Coast – crunchy ruminations and sing-songy contemplations of what it means to depend on and grow alongside one another. You’d follow them anywhere.LS33Amaarae – Black StarView image in fullscreenIrrepressible … Amaarae.Photograph: Salomé Gomis-TreziseWe all need an Amaarae in our lives: the person who, when you weakly protest that you’re a bit tired to go out, will soon have you holding a bottle of decanted rum in the back of an Uber, while alongside you she looks quizzically at a series of resealable plastic bags. “Ketamine, coke and molly,” she chants on Starkilla; “I spiked this drink so please open your mouth,” she tells her lover on Fineshyt. And this club-ready album from the irrepressible Ghanaian-American pop star ends up being a sensual body high, as she chases sex and glamour into the ends of the night.BBT32Perfume Genius – GloryWith typical grace and humour Mike Hadreas sends up his self-defeating tendencies on his seventh album, and wonders how old you have to be to escape those lifelong patterns: like the contradiction of struggling to face the world while also fantasising about violence and romanticising “all the poems I’ll get out” of it. It feels apt that Glory starts with the western twang of It’s a Mirror, suggesting a fixed, brawny masculine archetype – then breaks it down over the course of the record, a gothic, celestial voyage into the interior, and the latest addition to a uniquely beautiful American songbook.LS31Horsegirl – Phonetics On and OnView image in fullscreenFinely tuned … Horsegirl.Photograph: Ruby FayeSpindly rock à la the Velvets and the Raincoats is as spartan in its constituent parts as it is high on reward, and Chicago trio Horsegirl demonstrated the inexhaustible pleasures of this 60-year-old form on their second album. With production from Cate Le Bon, they wove magic from just a few thrumming guitar and bass notes and Nora Cheng’s nonchalant, near-spoken vocals, as well as a knack for melodic hooks as finely turned as intricate woodwork: the bittersweet, skipping chorus of Information Content is an all-timer.LS30-2130Oklou – Choke EnoughTrance, medieval polyphony and Y2K pop may seem like odd bedfellows, but French singer-producer Oklou cast them all in a dawn-like haze on her gorgeous debut album, flowing these distinct disciplines together until they swooped and soared like a flock of starlings. Choke Enough was no academic exercise, either, with standout pop moments including Take Me By the Hand with Bladee – a winsome conjuring of how Alice Deejay might sound in collaboration with a piping minstrel.LS29Jacob Alon – In LimerenceView image in fullscreenRustling with life … Jacob Alon performing at the ZYN Rolling Stone UK Awards, in London’s Roundhouse.Photograph: Sue Moore/Hogan Media/ShutterstockOne of the star-making moments of the year was at the Mercury prize, as Scottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon reduced the arena audience to a hush with just a voice and an acoustic guitar (though there were delighted whoops when a call of “free Palestine” was folded into their rendition of Fairy in a Bottle). It hopefully brought a broader audience to their debut album In Limerence, which has shades of Adrianne Lenker, Jeff Buckley and even Paul McCartney’s cadences to its unguarded indie-folk. It would have been easy to make this music blandly beautiful, but Alon and producer Dan Carey keep it rustling with life, as they reach for a burbling synth, trumpet improvisation or dusty-sounding drum kit.BBT28KeiyaA – Hooke’s LawThe title of the Chicago producer’s second album references the law of physics that reflects how stretch is proportional to load, how a spring always bounces back when tested within its elastic limit. The whistlestop Hooke’s Law expands and contracts accordingly as KeiyaA’s trifles with loss and romantic disappointment find their embodiment in racing breakbeats and collagist chaos one minute, gorgeous, soul-weary stillness – as with the liquid Stupid Prizes – the next. Listening can feel like being pleasurably blitzed with sensation, with each repeat revealing new details: an invitation to submit to KeiyaA’s masterful grip.LS27Wet Leg – MoisturizerIn 2022 they released one of the 21st century’s biggest indie debuts, which scored a UK No 1 and Grammy and Brit awards. The pressure was there for the follow-up, but not only did it top the charts again and earn another couple of Grammy noms, it had even more swagger and heart. “You wanna fuck me, I know, most people do,” Rhian Teasdale shrugs on Mangetout, and she actively intimidates a lustful bloke on Catch These Fists – but much of the album is given over to her wonderment at falling in love. “I’ll be your Davina, I’m coming to get you … I’ll be your Shakira, whenever, wherever”, she sings: great new vows for millennial weddings.BBT26Wolf Alice – The ClearingView image in fullscreenSomething symphonic … Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice performing at Manchester Arena.Photograph: Andy Von Pip/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“English bands are so hesitant to ever admit ambition, but I am ambitious with this record,” Wolf Alice’s drummerJoel Amey saidas The Clearing was announced – and sure enough, this was a huge step up and out for a band who were already one of British indie’s biggest. There’s something symphonic about the heft of it and not just because of the string sections, thanks to superb production by Greg Kurstin: the bass and toms are heavy yet warm, the piano pounding yet not overbearing. Ellie Rowsell sings about suitably big themes, too, from universe-bending love on Leaning Against the Wall (“it really, really made the room sing, the way you said my name”), invaluable friendship on Just Two Girls, and The Sofa’s uplifting manifesto for being wild and indolent instead of toeing the line.BBT25Wednesday – BleedsThe North Carolina band’s sixth album is littered with endings, some violent – the title of Carolina Murder Suicide tells you all you need to know – some devastatingly mundane, as Karly Hartzman examined the cracks that led to a long relationship’s end. Her unique gaze unites both, noticing the details and dynamics that other songwriters might write off as inconsequential: like the “mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail” at a wake in Wound Up Here (By Holdin On). Full of screaming noise and riffs that evoke knee-sliding through the mud, as well as moments of unexpected sweetness, Bleeds shows the fullest picture of her band yet.LS24Titanic – HagenView image in fullscreenUncontainable euphoria … Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta of Titanic.Photograph: Janet ChauThere can be few faster-evolving ensembles than that of Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta, who in just two albums have leapt from sparkling cabaret jazz to … whatever the uncontainable euphoria of Hagen is. It’s a record that vaults from blast beats to choral beauty, eerie splendour to nervy cacophonies, like nothing else you’ve heard. Despite these bold stylistic clashes, it hangs together beautifully, thanks also to Fratti’s spectacular voice, as capable of cirrus-like delicacy as parched sharpness.LS23Cate Le Bon – Michelangelo DyingWhere two of this year’s most prominent breakup albums were savage (Lily Allen) or spectacular (Rosalía), Welsh innovator Cate Le Bon’s hypnotically murky seventh album reflected the circular sadness of love faltering – the catch-22 of wanting to escape heartbreak while knowing that letting go means relinquishing something that was once profound. Michelangelo Dying contains some of her very best choruses and melodies, powerful enough to penetrate the album’s billowing haze of guitar, sax and synths, like a hand reaching out in the dark.LS22Little Simz – LotusView image in fullscreenWider reckoning … Little Simz performing at the Co-op Live arena in Manchester.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianSimz’s sixth album came amid a dispute with the Sault producer Inflo – she has sued him for allegedly failing to repay a loan – and a couple of tracks target him in all but name (“You talk about God when you have a God complex / I think you’re the one that needs saving”). But Simz seems to be having a wider reckoning: she revels in how far she’s come from once just having “a dream and a pushbike”, and reflects on self-preservation, creative frustration and – in a gorgeous, naturalistic back-and-forth with Wretch 32 – push-pull family dynamics.BBT21John Glacier – Like a RibbonFor all that you can link her to trip-hop and cloud rap, what British MC has ever really sounded like this? It would be easy to call Glacier monotone, but in truth her careful, even flow holds so much musicality: her deliberately limited melodic and rhythmic range means that the subtle distinctions in her vocals are fascinating, as she goes from bored to wry to boastful to poignant within one-degree turns on the emotional thermostat. The grainy, faintly corrupted beats are superb, but it’s that delivery, and her lyrics themselves – stoic and even amused as life blows her from place to place – which make this album an all-timer in UK rap.BBT20-1120Aya – Hexed!A series of surreal vignettes confronting addiction, panic and the challenges of growing up queer, Aya Sinclair’s experimental electronic masterwork is a wind-whipped dash around the towns and moors of Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. From the rotor blade-whomp of Peach to the infernal pattering snares on Navel Gazer, her sound design hits you like a ton of feathers: a surreal, destabilising flurry of detail. And the lyrics, done as careful mutters or sarky sing-song, are world-class. Her poetry revels in multiple meanings – is she saying “Flemish” or “phlegmish”? – and in the plasticity of language, rhyme and even lived experience, whether retelling a toxic relationship (“Couple rows so we could pop our cysts / as though the pus’d bust right out of the tryst”) or evoking the feeling of being totally cut adrift: “Abseil away another day supine inside the bag.”BBT19Clipse – Let God Sort Em OutView image in fullscreenRich with wisdom … Malice and Pusha T of Clipse.Photograph: Cian MooreThey may have been outdone by Oasis as 2025’s most anticipated fraternal comeback, but there was still considerable excitement around the return of Gene and Terrence Thornton, AKA Clipse’s Malice and Pusha T. After making two of the best albums in 00s rap, Malice found God and left Pusha to it. But on returning, Malice’s mic tone – which always had a sort of ancient, oaken majesty to it – felt rich with wisdom, while Pusha, who in the interim had beefed Drake to hugely entertaining effect, still had his nose for a scrap, this time with Travis Scott. Together, they advocated for their own brilliance and for what they see as a better class of rap, sometimes at the same time: “They content-create, I despise that / I create content then they tries that.”BBT18Big Thief – Double InfinityAfter their bassist Max Oleartchik left the group, Big Thief pressed on as a trio but brought in a number of auxiliary musicians, resulting in an album that sounds like it could have been worked up around the campfire of a utopian off-grid commune. These are some of the American band’s best, biggest-hearted songs to date, with the type of easy facility with melody – and equally easy access to their emotions – that can’t be taught. Take Grandmother, in which frontperson Adrianne Lenker surveys our collapsing world and flawed humanity, and decides on the singalong chorus: “Gonna turn it all into rock’n’roll.” In many other hands this would be trite, but as with so much of Big Thief’s music, the purity of intention makes it life-affirming.BBT17Alex G – HeadlightsView image in fullscreenA new frontier … Alex G.Photograph: Chris MaggioWhat constitutes integrity? Working for love or money? Freedom or obligation to others? On his first album for a major label, standing at a new frontier of success, Alex G weighs these existential questions in appropriately vast, beautiful indie-rock epics, some breathless with anxiety (Spinning), others sardonic (Real Thing) or severe (Headlights). Despite the very contemporary, very Alex G touches – take the sprite-like voices and distortion of Bounce Boy – there’s a comforting solidity to this record that makes it feel as though it’s existed for ever, sharing the same spooked twilight as the best of Yo La Tengo and REM.LS16Pulp – MoreThe anticipation of a reunion album rarely measures up to the often dismal results. Perhaps the key is to spend a solid chunk of years playing together again, as Pulp did, before risking putting anything down on record. “I exist to do this / Shouting and pointing,” Jarvis Cocker sang on comeback single Spike Island; anyone who’s seen Pulp in recent years can attest that he has lost none of his calligraphic physical flair. Nor, as the magnificent More proves, has his gimlet eye for the grubby disappointments of middle age diminished. Life apparently feels no less of a charade at 62 than early adulthood did back in the 90s, a fact he sells as both anticlimax and a weird kind of comfort: if that’s the case, the unvarnished love songs and heartfelt stands against commodification suggested, you might as well stick it all on the line.LS15Turnstile – Never EnoughView image in fullscreenUncomplicated thrills … Turnstile in concert in Guadalajara, Mexico.Photograph: Medios y Media/Getty ImagesIs it hardcore punk or not? As this dull debate brewed on comment sections and Discord servers, the rest of the world got on with the business of just enjoying the uncomplicated thrills on Turnstile’s latest. Certainly, Seein’ Stars sounds like 90s Duran Duran, the epic title track could be played as NFL teams run on to the field and even the hardcore-paced Dull and Solo have a sheen to them. But for every frowning punk purist, you had 10 more lining up to pile into the pit with smiles a mile wide.BBT14Deftones – Private MusicThis was the US alt-metallers’ first album back after serendipitously getting a huge new following via TikTok, particularly for their sweeter, shoegazier material. But rather than court that audience by cynically remaking Sextape 11 times over, they instead created a balletic cyborg of a record. The riffs could put a dent in concrete masonry, but the groove-metal rhythms are light-footed and, as ever, vocalist Chino Moreno sets out even wider tonal possibilities. It’s as if waves of pain and relief pass across his spirit as he goes from dry croaks to thunderous denouncements to blissful clean singing.BBT13Suede – AntidepressantsThree decades since their debut and five albums into the second phase of their career, Suede sound as impassioned and vital as they ever have. Brett Anderson’s voice is a long way from the nasal sneer of Animal Nitrate all those years ago: it’s now rounder and deeper in colour, reminiscent of Echo and the Bunnymen’s Ian McCulloch, but the core Suede theme – humanity in all its reckless and sexy brokenness – is still there. Playing post-punk with a Britpop grandeur, Anderson and co reckon with the fleeting nature of existence (“Formless as a cloud / Weightless as a sound”) and the caprices of brain chemistry, but with a sense of optimism, even triumph.BBT12Jim Legxacy – Black British Music (2025)View image in fullscreenMore assured … Jim Legxacy.Photograph: Igoris TarranHis previous mixtape Homeless N*gga Pop Music was at No 42 in our 2023 albums list; rapper-producer Jim Legxacy jumps up the rankings as his place in British rap becomes more and more assured. Beats-wise, he defines the joyous anything-goes energy of the current UK underground, expertly applying chipmunk effects to samples, adding funny DJ-style vocal tags (“turn that mediocre bullshit off, we’re listening to Jim Legxacy right now!”) and even making a left turn into high-tempo pop-rock for ’06 Wayne Rooney. There’s more of a mournful cast to the lyrics though, as he works through grief for his late sister, and confronts the lingering effects of his impoverished, fatherless childhood.BBT11Jade – That’s Showbiz Baby!Pop’s trickiest manoeuvre is crossing the divide from successful group to solo career. After departing Little Mix, Jade Thirlwall didn’t so much jump it as pirouette across: her multi-part debut solo single Angel of My Dreams was completely nuts, impossible to ignore and spent 20 weeks on the UK chart. Could a whole album match up? From trashy ballroom house (It Girl) to disco-funk (Fantasy, Headache), Robyn-esque sad bangers (Plastic Box, Self Saboteur) and waltz-time ballads (Natural at Disaster), she certainly has the range, not to mention smart and sweary lyrics – rhyming Edward Enninful with experimental is a neat encapsulation of what moves her. It’s her voice that really sets it all apart, though: as you’d expect of a talent show graduate turned longtime pop star, it remains stunning on a technical level, but Thirlwall also brings a whole West End musical’s worth of emotion.BBT10-6 coming soonCome back tomorrow for the next 10 albums in the countdown!

It’ll take more than youth clubs and StarmerTok to reach themGaby HinsliffLabour’s £500m national youth strategy has some positives, but real change must start by tackling the root causes of unhappinessThu 11 Dec 2025 11.58 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 13.09 ESTShareBonnie Blue, the porn actor who recently made headlines for her antics in Bali – which you probably shouldn’t Google – has come out in support of Nigel Farage.And in not unconnected news, “rage baiting” – saying deliberately annoying things to get attention – is the Oxford University Press’sword of the year. Bonnie’s most effective way of advertising her X-rated content to the masses now is by generating enough controversy to get her publicly talked about, and she’s very good at making just enough noise (this time inthe Spectator, of all places) to drum up a bit of traffic.But to say that diversifying into hard-right politics makes her an outlier for her existing young fanbase is nonetheless an understatement, given Reform is now polling atjust 5%among under-24s. If Bonnie is selling something young men want, it ain’t her take on inheritance tax policy.What a lot of lost teenagers actually want from government, according to research launchedthis weekby the culture secretary Lisa Nandy, is heartbreakingly simple: a trusted adult outside the family with time for them (one in five can’t identify anyone who fits this category, with boystwice as likely as girlsto lack such a figure); something fun to do that gets them off the phones with which they have a love-hate relationship; a secure job; better mental health support.The national youth strategy unveiled this week was Labour’s attempt to reach out to gen Z, with a thoroughly welcome £500m investment in youth workers (to provide those supportive trusted adults) plus more youth apprenticeshipsand a review of what is undermining their mental health that may prove a lot more thoughtful than headlines aboutoverdiagnosissuggest. (I’d be very surprised if Peter Fonagy, the psychologist leading the review for Wes Streeting, doesn’t dig deep into the societal shifts affecting teenagers, from the pandemic to parenting, social media and academic pressures at school.) But it will take more than Keir Starmer joining TikTokto get all this across to young people, and more than this rather thin strategy to bring it together coherently.Like Bonnie, politicians live or die now by their ability to reach an audience increasingly getting its news from what goes viral on social media. Streeting instinctively gets the need for drama and controversial talking points, which is why his bit of the package is the one arguably mostly likely to reach gen Z ears. Reconciling the showmanship with serious policymaking, however, appears to be a work in progress.So here’s a talking point to consider, and it’s rethinking the generational contract between old and young. A report this week from rightwing thinktank the Centre for Social Justice, authored by former Tory MP Miriam Cates, argued forscrapping the pension lockthat has been boosting pensioner incomes ever since her party introduced it back in 2011, and investing the money in children. She joins a groundswell of rightwing voices saying surprisingly loudly what a Labour government daren’t: that too much of the welfare bill goes on elderly people, painfully squeezing what is available to the young.As young children, this generation of teenagers endured a lockdown that disrupted their education and kept them from their friends, mostly to protect the lives of elderly people. Now they’re trying to spread their wings in a world that won’t make space for them. They’re berated for not getting jobs even as well-intended rises in the minimum wage and in employers’ national insurance make them more expensive to hire, and nagged to get off their phones even when there’s precious little else to do. (Nandy’s research on the gap she is trying to fill showed a quarter of teenagers didn’t know of anywhere nearby offering opportunities to do something more sociable, from youth clubs to sports clubs to the kind of arts and music provision that councils have had to cut in the austerity years.) Bans on teenagers congregating in shopping malls and fast-food joints, often introduced post-pandemic amid fears about antisocial behaviour, froze them out of the few remaining places they could hang out independently with friends.Though Nandy’s new youth clubs are a good downpayment on a new deal for the young, tackling their unhappiness at the root will require less blaming them for their own troubles, more money, and more honest reflection by adults on whether as a society we’ve got the balance between maturity and youth right. If it takes a village to raise one child, then raising everyone’s children takes a country.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionKeir StarmerWes StreetingLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Gael García Bernal plays a sociopathic outsider threatening the apparently perfect life of his long-lost preacher father (William Hurt). In what now looks like a dry run forThere Will Be Blood, Dano is the earnest son campaigning for creationism to be taught at school, and sideswiped by the emergence of his sinister half-brother. Variety labelled the film “noxious”. It’s undoubtedly nasty, but Dano helps to lend it a pulse.9.Swiss Army Man(2016)Superficially macabre, this buddy-movie with Dano as the stranded shipwreck survivor and Daniel Radcliffe as the corpse who washes ashore is surprisingly touching. Sure, it is full of the sort of manufactured eccentricity that would reach fever pitch in the same directors’ next film,Everything Everywhere All at Once. But even as Dano is using Radcliffe’s body as a water dispenser, a hunting weapon and a fart-powered raft, a palpable tenderness emerges. They make a lovely couple.8.The Fabelmans(2022)View image in fullscreenVersatile … (from left): Paul Dano, Mateo Zoryan Francis-DeFord and Michelle Williams in The Fabelmans.Photograph: Merie Weismiller Wallace/APFor a measure of Dano’s versatility, try this: in the space of a few months, he played the placid engineer Burt Fabelman, workaholic dad to the budding film-maker hero of Steven Spielberg’s autobiographical saga (and loosely based on the director’s own father, Arnold),andmenaced Gotham City as the Riddler in The Batman. Dano nails Burt’s hushed, gulping melancholy as he watches his unfaithful wife (Michelle Williams) and ambitious son (Gabriel LaBelle) slip free of his influence.7.Little Miss Sunshine(2006)A likable road movie about an Albuquerque family driving cross-country in a yellow VW van so that the youngest child (Abigail Breslin) can compete in a beauty pageant. It smacks now of a certain Sundance 00s indie preciousness but the cast, including Alan Arkin (who won an Oscar for playing the disreputable grandfather), is a treat. Dano is poignant and funny as the emo teen who communicates solely in scribbled notes (eg “I hate everyone”) until a crisis draws from him an anguished Munchian scream. Few actors could make the mission-statement dialogue that follows – “Fuck beauty contests! Life is one fucking beauty contest after another!” – sound so sincere.6.For Ellen(2012)View image in fullscreenWrenching … Dano in For Ellen.Photograph: Album/AlamyComedian and actor Kate McKinnon described Dano in 2016 as a “hunky sad-eyed sex machine” but that quality has rarely been exploited straightforwardly on screen. One exception is this wrenching study of a deadbeat-dad rock musician who grabs a last chance to connect with his daughter. “It came alive because of Paul,” said the film’s director, So Yong Kim. “He developed so many details. The outfits, the rings, fingernails, hair, the way he walked and carried himself. He transformed completely.”5.The Batman(2022)As the masked, panting, clingfilm-wrapped Riddler, AKA Edward Nashton, Dano is terrifying even when he isn’t dispatching his victims with hammers and bombs. He even seems to give Robert Pattinson’s Batman the heebie-jeebies. Best of all is the moment near the end of Matt Reeves’s increasingly baggy superhero reboot when Dano is at last seen without his mask, and the suspense tightens all at once. Apprehended by cops in a diner, he is presented with an array of different IDs, each one bearing his face. “Which one’s you?” asks the arresting officer. “You tell me,” he replies coolly. Spoken like a true character actor.4.L.I.E.(2001)View image in fullscreenCherubic … Paul Dano in L.I.E.Photograph: Metro Tartan/AllstarDano had amassed plenty of childhood acting experience – aged 12, he was already sharing a Broadway stage with George C Scott – but his special gift for flayed vulnerability was first apparent to cinema audiences in this unsettling indie drama. In only his second screen role, he plays a neglected teenager who falls into the orbit of a sex offender (Brian Cox). Still shocking is the moment when Cox tenderly shaves Dano’s cherubic face with a cut-throat razor. “My first thought now is: how did we do that?”Dano said in 2023, before confirming that Cox, with whom he was reunited in the odd-couple comedy-drama The Good Heart and on television in the BBC’s War and Peace, “was lovely to me”.3.Ruby Sparks(2012)Marketed as a romcom, this is far stickier and more complex than that label would suggest: one wag described it as Annie Hall meets Frankenstein. Back in the care of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the husband-and-wife directing team behind Little Miss Sunshine, Dano plays a blocked novelist whose creative juices start flowing again after he invents an idealised female character, Ruby (played by Dano’s partner, Zoe Kazan, who is also the film’s screenwriter). Once she springs to life, he discovers he can modify and control her characteristics merely by setting them down on paper, which leads to an acutely disturbing climax. Dano is adept at compartmentalising the sweet (Swiss Army Man) and the unsavoury (Prisoners), but it’s fascinating to see them mixed together here on the same palette.2.There Will Be Blood(2007)View image in fullscreenElectrifying … Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano in There Will Be Blood.Photograph: TCD/ProdDB/Alamy‘As a kid, I’d cry every day seeing homeless people’: Paul Dano on money, fatherhood and being shaved by Brian CoxRead moreWhen Paul Thomas Anderson sacked Kel O’Neill, the actor initially cast as the snivelling, sanctimonious preacher Eli Sunday, Dano was promoted to the role with only a few days’ notice. (He also kept his original part, the smaller role of Eli’s brother Paul.) The result is electrifying: Eli may writhe and wriggle as he casts the demons out of his congregation, but it’s Dano who feels like a man possessed. In accusing him of giving “a non-entity performance”,Quentin Tarantinomisunderstands the dynamic between the ogre-like oil prospector Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and the irksome Eli, who threatens his stranglehold. The Pulp Fiction director craves an equally weighted standoff. But the oil titan is rattled and exasperated precisely because this apparently puny adversary gets under his skin. He can’t fathom the boy: he’s not a business rival, like the prim suits Plainview taunts in the restaurant scene, and he isn’t a cheat, like the man posing as Plainview’s brother. Those dopes are run-of-the-mill. (Plainview insults the former and wastes no time killing the latter.) Eli, though, is a uniquely stubborn irritant. To put another alpha-male type opposite Day-Lewis would have rendered the battle conventional. That’s one thing Dano couldn’t be if he tried.1.Love & Mercy(2014)View image in fullscreenA mighty performance … Paul Dano in Love & Mercy.Photograph: François Duhamel/Roadside Attractions/AllstarThis fractured Brian Wilson biopic ping-pongs between the 1960s (LSD, Pet Sounds, the first massing of clamorous voices in Wilson’s head) and the 1980s (when the genius Beach Boy was drugged and dominated by an exploitative doctor, played by Paul Giamatti in skin-crawling mode). A bold concept demands bold actors, and this film has them: John Cusack is suitably dazed and wary as the older Wilson, while Dano has the more demanding task in encapsulating the musician’s fizzing highs and plunging lows, as well as all the shades of trauma in between. From Wilson’s perfectionism in the studio, conducting a chorus of barking dogs or abandoning an expensive recording session because of bad vibrations, to his hounded timidity in the presence of his abusive father (Bill Camp), this is a layered and mighty performance – Dano’s best on film, in fact, equalled only by his portrayal of a convict having an affair with a prison employee in Ben Stiller’s 2018 mini-series Escape at Dannemora. Judging from Tarantino’s macho playground taunts (he calls Dano “weak sauce” and “a weak sister”), his beef seems to hinge on a perceived deficit of red meat in the milky-faced actor. A few minutes of Love & Mercy are all it takes to render that charge at best ill-informed, at worst moronic. As Anthony Lane attestedin his rave New Yorker review: “There is nothing wimpish in [Dano’s] fine depiction of Wilson.”Explore more on these topicsFilmRankedPaul DanoThere Will Be BloodQuentin TarantinoThe FabelmansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But things will get worse in the days ahead, NHS leaders said, as medical bosses urged people to get vaccinated against the virus so they can enjoy Christmas gatherings more safely.‘We don’t have enough rooms to isolate’: NHS doctor reveals impact of rise in flu casesRead moreKeir Starmer and the health secretary, Wes Streeting, have launched a coordinated assault on the British Medical Association for its “irresponsible” decision to call thousands of resident doctors inEnglandout on strike next week.They urged resident – formerly junior – doctors to endorse the government’s latest offer to settle the long-running pay and jobs dispute and avoid the NHS having to grapple with a five-day strike due to start next Wednesday that has caused huge alarm in the service.Sir Jim Mackey, the chief executive of NHS England, has already described the strike as “cruel”, “calculated” and designed to “cause mayhem” given its timing. It may yet be called off, but only if enough resident doctors see an improved offer from Streeting, made on Wednesday, as enough of a reason to do so.NHS ‘facing worst-case scenario’ as hospital flu cases jump 55% in a weekRead moreNHS England data released on Thursday showed an average of 2,660 people a day were being treated in hospital last week as a direct result of flu – 55% up on the 1,717 the week before and enough to fill three NHS trusts. It is the highest number ever seen in the first week of December and included 106 people in intensive care, mostly with difficulty breathing.Prof Meghana Pandit, NHS England’s joint medical director, said: “The number of patients in hospital with flu is extremely high for this time of year.“Even worse, it continues to rise and the peak is not in sight yet, so the NHS faces an extremely challenging few weeks ahead.”The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) – which mainly affects babies and elderly people – and Covid are also causing problems. Those, combined with a mutated and highly virulent strain of flu that is circulating, are threatening to “engulf hospitals”, Pandit added.Starmer says resident doctors would be irresponsible to strike in face of flu crisisRead moreThe number of people needing care has put a growing number of hospital trusts under such pressure that they have had to declare a critical incident – an admission that they cannot cope with demand and need help.The UKHealthSecurity Agency appealed for people who had not had a flu jab to get one as soon as possible.Dr Conall Watson, a consultant epidemiologist at the UKHSA, said: “There is still plenty of flu vaccine available to protect those who need it. What’s running out is time to be protected ahead of Christmas.”The agency sought to reassure the public that the flu vaccine that is available UK-wide does reduce the risk of flu leaving people seriously unwell.It explained that the virus is causing escalating problems because of an unusually early start to the season and “a drifted flu H3N2 strain … circulating … meaning less natural immunity in the community”.But, it added, its data “shows the vaccine being used this winter is effective at preventing severe disease”.“H3N2 strains typically affect older adults more severely than H1N1 strains, leading to more hospitalisations and deaths, creating pressure on our NHS this winter.”The latest UKHSA figures showed worryingly low take-up of the flu vaccine among at-risk groups. Just 37.4% of under-65s who have one or more long-term health conditions had been vaccinated by 7 December.Even fewer pregnant women – only 35.6% – had done so, as had 41.5% of children aged two or under and 42.3% of three-year-olds.However, take-up among the over-65s is much higher, at 71.7%Doctors urged the public to do what they can to minimise the risk of getting or spreading flu. Ed Hutchinson, a professor of molecular and cellular virology at Glasgow University, said: “Things like masking, social distancing and working from home can have a large impact on the spread of influenza viruses.”Shereen Hussein, a professor of health policy at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, urged people to check on the welfare of older relatives and neighbours and take them to be vaccinated.“This Christmas, safe connection should be the priority [when visiting people]. Short but frequent visits, good ventilation, wearing a mask if you have mild symptoms or have been recently unwell, and using phone or video calls if an in-person visit is not safe,” Hussein added.Watson, from the UKHSA, also reiterated its advice that “if you have symptoms and need to go out, you should consider wearing a face covering”.Some pharmacies have recently run short of flu vaccine. However, pharmacy groups stressed that they comprised only a few “isolated” cases and that there is plenty of the vaccine available.Separate NHS England data also published on Thursday showed that the waiting list of those seeking planned hospital care rose again in October, albeit slightly, to 7.4m treatments, up from 7.39m in September.Dr Vicky Price, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: “The latest performance data … paints a sadly familiar picture of a system under relentless strain.“While the ongoing ‘flu-nami’ is being invoked as the primary cause of the crisis, this is a convenient scapegoat when the reality is that the situation is the direct result of a longstanding and predictable breakdown in NHS capacity and workforce shortages.”Streeting said there was “a tidal wave of flu tearing through our hospitals”.Explore more on these topicsNHSFluHospitalsHealthEnglandIndustrial actionnewsShareReuse this content"

Or what will stop them disguising themselves as civilians and taking over this free economic zone? This is all very serious. It’s not a fact that Ukraine would agree to it, but if you are talking about a compromise then it has to be a fair compromise.”He said if Ukraine did agree to such a scheme, there would need to be elections or a referendum to ratify it, saying that only “the Ukrainian people” could make decisions on territorial concessions.1:18Zelenskyy says ceasefire needed before elections can take place in Ukraine – videoUnder the US plans, said Zelenskyy, Ukraine would withdraw from Donbas, where Russia is advancing, while the frontlines would be frozen in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Russia would give up a few small pockets of land it controls in other regions.Zelenskyy has been under immense pressure from Donald Trump to sign up to the US peace plan. In recent days Trump has attacked Zelenskyy, claiming he “has not even read” the draft peace plan andsuggesting he lacks legitimacyand Ukraine should hold an election.Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said on Thursday: “The president is extremely frustrated with both sides of this war, and he is sick of meetings just for the sake of meeting.”Zelenskyy said the Ukrainian negotiating team had sent their revised plan back to Washington on Wednesday, and that questions over territory and control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant were two of the remaining sticking points. “It’s not the final plan; it’s a reaction to what we received … the plan is constantly being worked on and edited, and this is a continuous process that is still going on,” he said.If Washington and Kyiv do agree, the much bigger question remains of whetherVladimir Putinis really ready to sign a deal or is merely buying time with fake negotiations and hoping to continue his military advance over the winter.In Berlin, the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, said on Thursday that if Putin was allowed to get his way in Ukraine then the prospect of war inEuropewould become more real, warning that the continent had been “quietly complacent” over the threat from Russia.A new war waged by Russia could come within the next five years and could be “on the scale of war our grandparents and great-grandparents endured”, Rutte suggested. He issued a now-familiar call for all European countries to increase defence spending. “Too many believe that time is on our side. It is not. The time for action is now,” he added.Rutte is among the European politicians who have been working hard to keep the Trump administration on side when it comes to Ukraine policy, as the US president appears to get ever more impatient with the lack of a peace deal.On Thursday afternoon, Zelenskyy held a video call with about 30 leaders from the “coalition of the willing” nations, which support Ukraine, but without Trump.In some European capitals there is increasing sentiment that Ukraine will have to make painful compromises, as the country enters its fourth winter of full-scale war, with a difficult situation on the frontline and huge power issues caused by repeated Russian strikes on energy infrastructure.However, the leaders of France, Britain and Germany, whomet Zelenskyy in Downing Street on Monday, are keen to stress that only Ukraine can decide on territorial questions. “It would be a mistake to force the Ukrainian president into a peace that his people will not accept after four years of suffering and death,” Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, said on Thursday.Zelenskyy said that in addition to the overall framework agreement, there were two separate documents that Ukraine hoped to sign in the coming days, one on potential security guarantees that would come into effect if Russia attacked Ukraine again and one on Ukraine’s economic renewal.Also on Thursday, top EU officials met in Lviv, in western Ukraine, to discuss Ukraine’s accession prospects, even as Hungary’s Russia-friendly leader, Viktor Orbán, continues to block formal negotiations.All other EU members are in favour of Ukraine joining, and officials have said they want to accept Ukraine anyway provided the country can move forward on aligning its laws and practices with EU regulations. “Ukraine will become a member of the EU, and nobody can block it,” said Marta Kos, the EU enlargement commissioner, at the talks.Zelenskyy said he hoped Trump would put pressure on Hungary and any other EU country that might block Ukraine. “We all understand that the US president has various levers of influence, and these will work on those who are currently blocking Ukraine,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS foreign policyDonald TrumpVladimir PutinEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

All I can say to support that woman is yes I did hear about it, yes I was invited to be a part of the team, yes I saw, I did see, factual transcripts, I know it was going on, I know that the surveillance teams were being used against her and her family. But I can’t provide any documentary evidence for that.”Associated Newspapers Ltd (ANL) is accused by seven claimants, including Sir Elton John and his husband, David Furnish; Elizabeth Hurley; Sadie Frost and Sir Simon Hughes, of carrying out or commissioning unlawful activities such as hiring private investigators to place listening devices inside cars, “blagging” private records and accessing private phone conversations.ANL denies the allegations and is defending the legal action. ANL has said that allegations of unlawful information gathering in relation to Lawrence are “appalling and utterly groundless smears”.Last month, a second private investigator central to the legal action by the Duke of Sussex and others against the publisher of the Daily Mail claimed that his signature on an earlier witness statement was a “forgery”.Gavin Burrows, linked to the most serious allegations of unlawful information, retracted his alleged confession, saying it was “completely false”.Burrows had allegedly claimed in a 2021 witness statement that he and his team obtained information by hacking voicemails, tapping landline phones and bugging cars. He also allegedly said he had worked on behalf of the Mail on Sunday.Five of the claimants have told the high court they embarked on the legal action against ANL based on evidence apparently obtained by Burrows.Burrowspreviously retracted his alleged statement in 2023.In a fresh, 30-page witness statement made on 25 September 2025, and released by the high court last month, he restated his denial, saying he had never carried out any illegal activity on behalf of ANL.The Dispatches programme, broadcast on Thursday, also provided new details as to the funding of those helping Harry and Lawrence build a legal case against Associated Newspapers.According to the programme, the father of James Stunt, long a target of Daily Mail investigations, provided money to Graham Johnson, a former News of the World journalist, who has been assisting as a researcher. James Stunt is the former of husband of Petra Ecclestone.Geoff Stunt told Dispatches that any claim that he “funded research into illegal activities at the Daily Mail as some kind of ‘revenge’ … is false and misconceived”.He told the programme that he had “funded research into whether he and his family members had been subject to ANL’s unlawful information gathering activities” but that he “has never funded research into illegal activities at the Daily Mail for the purposes of the present claims”.The actor Hugh Grant also told the programme that he funded Johnson’s research into rumours the paper had offered money to the Soham murderer Ian Huntley.He said: “In 2015 Graham Johnson asked me to help fund research into … reports that Daily Mail journalists had offered payments to Ian Huntley, subsequently convicted of the murder of two young girls at Soham.“If the research had established the truth of these reports it would have been a matter for the police, not the civil courts … I have never used the services of Graham Johnson, whether directly or indirectly, for evidence gathering for litigation of any kind.”Explore more on these topicsMediaDaily MailNewspapers & magazinesNational newspapersNewspapersPrince HarryDoreen LawrencenewsShareReuse this content"

Most likely – here’s why | Luke BeckRead more“As the Australian Human Rights Commission put it, ‘There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights.’”Reddit argued it was a forum primarily for adults without the traditional social media features the government has “taken issue with”.Reddit was challenging the law on the grounds it infringed on the implied freedom of political communication. It was also seeking to challenge whether Reddit could be considered an age-restricted social media platform under the legislation.It said it was not seeking to challenge the law to avoid compliance, and had implemented age-assurance measures since Wednesday.The company said the vast majority of Redditors were adults, and advertising wasn’t targeted to children under 18. The Apple app store age rating for Reddit is 17+.“Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark on actually protecting young people online,” Reddit said. “So, while we will comply with this law, we have a responsibility to share our perspective and see that it is reviewed by the courts.”Reddit’s challenge is separate from one filed by New South Wales Libertarian MP John Ruddick’sDigital Freedom Project group. The next court appearance for Digital Freedom Project group is late February, and Reddit expects it will be heard sometime next year, if the high court takes up the case.A law that has the effect of reducing the overall volume of political communication in Australia will be invalid unless it is proportionate to a legitimate purpose, constitutional law professor Luke Beckwrote in the Guardian on Thursday.“[But] the social media account ban only slightly reduces the overall volume of political communication in Australia,” the Monash University academic said.“The law does not ban teenagers from using the internet or having online group chats. It’s likely that in the [Ruddick] social media account case … the government will succeed.”The Guardian revealed on Tuesday thatReddit had argued to the eSafety commissioner in Septemberthat it should be excluded from the ban.“The sole or significant purpose of our platform is to provide knowledge-sharing in timely, context-rich conversations; interaction between end-users is simply an incidental step to enabling this primary purpose,” Reddit said in the letter obtained under freedom of information laws.‘Already had a profound effect’: parents react to Australia’s social media banRead more“It is not in keeping with Reddit norms for users to use their real names or identities on Reddit, as communities are not centred around real-time social networking among young people.”Reddit does not promote real-time presence, friend requests or activity feeds that drive ongoing engagement, the company said. It said it was committed to collecting minimal personal information from users to preserve pseudonymity on the platform.Reddit was a “pseudonymous platform organised around sharing information in topic-based communities rather than personal profiles or social networks,” the platform said.The 10 platforms the government announced were covered by the ban – Twitch, Kick, YouTube, Threads, Facebook, Instagram, Snap, X, TikTok and Reddit – had all implemented measures to comply by Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsSocial media banRedditSocial mediaAustralian lawnewsShareReuse this content"

The remaining £2.4bn will come from departmental spending outlined in November’s budget.Phillipson said: “This government will fix the broken education system for children and young people with Send by making sure that their local school is also the right school.Ministers face calls to explain how £6bn Send funding hole will be paid forRead more“Ahead of our reforms next year, we’re laying the foundations of a new system that shifts children with Send from forgotten to included and earns the confidence of parents.“This £3bn investment will transform lives. It will open the door to opportunity for tens of thousands of children with Send, giving them the chance to learn, belong and succeed in their local community.”The urgent need for change was highlighted byfiguresshowing that legal action by parents over their children’s special needs provision have continued to soar. The Ministry of Justice said the number of Send appeals heard by tribunals rose for the ninth year in a row to 25,002 in 2024-25, an 18% increase on the previous year.TheDepartment for Education(DfE) is working on reforms to be included in the schools white paper planned for early next year, with the schools minister, Georgia Gould, advisers and DfE officials conducting regional and online forums to gauge responses from parents, charities and school leaders.One of the DfE’s main principles is that children with special needs should be able to attend local schools alongside their peers, rather than having to travel long distances to find suitable provision.The DfE said its announcement would “lay the groundwork for significant future reform of the Send support system, helping to make schools inclusive by design”, with the white paper to detail how schools will be funded to support the specialist places.Gould said the white paper would look at “every aspect of the school system”, including issues such as behaviour and the high proportion of pupils with special needs who are suspended or excluded, while maintaining the important role of special schools for children with complex needs.About 460,000 children and young people in England have special needs provision through education, health and care plans (EHCPs), a legal document agreed between local authorities and families. But many find the EHCP processcomplicated and bureaucratic, forcing increasing numbers to appeal through specialist Send tribunals to modify or enforce their agreements with councils.The figures from the Ministry of Justice show that the number of registered appeals heard by the tribunals rocketed from just over 3,100 a decade ago to 25,002 in the last school year. The backlog has continued to grow, with 15,000 open cases recorded in September.Of the cases decided by the tribunal, 99% were found in favour of the appealing families.Madeleine Cassidy, the chief executive of the Independent Provider of Special Education Advice, a charity that focuses on England’s special needs laws, said: “[The figures] expose the scale of unlawful decision-making in local authorities.Childrenand young people with Send are still being routinely denied the educational provision to which they are legally entitled. This is a systemic failure, and one that must be addressed in next year’s white paper.”Some parents of special school pupils in England spending £5,000 on EHCPsRead moreSome of the new funding comes at the expense of free schools that were in the pipeline, including a Middlesbrough sixth form to be opened in a collaboration between Eton college and the Star academy chain. But two other sixth forms planned by the group, in Dudley and Oldham, will go ahead.The 60,000 special needs places include 10,000 included in special schools within the free school projects paused by the DfE. The department said just 15 special and alternative provision (AP) free schools would continue as planned but local authorities would be given the option to complete the remaining 77 projects or receive equivalent funding to deliver Send places.Meg Powell-Chandler, the director of theNew Schools Network, said: “We regret the decision to cancel a number of projects, and remain concerned that uncertainty persists for 77 vital special and AP free school proposals that would provide much-needed, high-quality specialist places.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsFree schoolsChildrenBridget PhillipsonDepartment for EducationSchool fundingSchoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

So I am surprised by his uninformed comments in response to claims from nearly 50 years ago from politically motivated actors.“If he is interested, I can show him the many messages that I have received from fellow pupils, including Jewish ones, that entirely contradict these allegations.”A number of those who have made claims of persistent abusive behaviour by Farage at school, running from the age of 13 to 18, have been concerned by the lack of comment from Dulwich college since the allegations were first made.Milne wrote: “To protect the college’s reputation in the long term, we have avoided making public statements in response to individual reports. This should not be interpreted as indifference: safeguarding the college’s good name and upholding its values are of paramount importance to us.“I appreciate that this can appear like silence, but the intention is to act responsibly and protect the long-term interests of the college and its community. What we can unequivocally state is that the behaviours described are entirely at odds with the Dulwich college of today.”Milne said the modern school had “robust” policies on “equality, diversity and inclusion, as well as strong anti-bullying measures”.Milne added: “I want to reassure you that the college takes these matters extremely seriously, and that our approach is guided by a genuine commitment to our values and to the wellbeing of the whole community – past and present. I hope this offers some clarity, though I appreciate that these issues evoke strong feelings for many alumni.”Lihou, 61, said: “As a former pupil and boarder at the school, I wrote to Dulwich college a week ago. I can say I am very pleased to have received a reply from the current master that the Dulwich of today has a very clear commitment to dignity, respect and to their processes to ensure that no repeat of the horrific racism and antisemitic bullying directed at the numerous people that have come forward can happen again.”A Reform spokesperson said: “This witch-hunt is merely an attempt to discredit Reform andNigel Farage. Instead of debating Reform on the substance of our ideas and policies, the leftwing media and deeply unpopular Labour party are now using 50-year-old smears in a last act of desperation. The British public see right through it.”Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageLondonReform UKRaceAntisemitismEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The content, which was used entirely without our knowledge, stands against all of our values.”The spokesperson said the venue “absolutely condemns antisemitism in every form”. They continued: “Acts of hatred, discrimination or prejudice of any kind are entirely unacceptable and have no place in our community or spaces. The safety of our staff and gig-going audiences remains of paramount importance to us.“We stand in solidarity with the Jewish community and remain committed to ensuring that our spaces are places where everyone feels secure, respected and valued.”Primal Scream, founded by frontman Bobby Gillespie in 1982, were performing a 25th anniversary show for their album XTRMNTR.As the band performed the song, pictures of political figures, including the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the US president, Donald Trump, appeared behind them with an animation of the swastika combined with the Star of David replacing their eyes.Images of the destruction in Gaza were also shown on screen. The video concluded with the words: “Our government is complicit in genocide.”The Community Security Trust, which offers security, advice and training to protect British Jews, released a statement saying it had reported the band to the police and urged the venue to conduct an “urgent investigation”. A CST spokesperson said: “Entwining a Star of David with a swastika implies that Jews are Nazis and risks encouraging hatred of Jews.“There needs to be an urgent investigation by the venue and the promoter about how this happened, and we have reported this to the police.”The Creative Community for Peace, a pro-Israel advocacy group that campaigns against antisemitism in the entertainment industry, described the display as “an act of profound malice, desecration, and cruelty”.It said: “The Star of David is a sacred symbol of Jewish identity; the swastika is the emblem of a genocidal regime responsible for the murder of 6 million Jews. To merge these two symbols is an act of profound malice, desecration, and cruelty. It is antisemitism in its starkest form.”Primal Scream and the Metropolitan police have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsLondonPrimal ScreamPop and rockAntisemitismEnglandShareReuse this content"

It means we need to try to isolate these patients and treat them – so they’ll come in with shortness of breath, [and a] cough.And while thenumbers are going up, we’re still getting the other patients coming in with falls and heart attacks and trauma. It puts pressure on the emergency department, and it puts pressure on the wards because you’re increasing the number of respiratory patients you’re managing.The other problem we find, and I’m sure other hospitals find this as well, is that when you’ve got these respiratory cases, you need to try to isolate them as much as possible so you avoid spreading the virus to other patients.NHS ‘facing worst-case scenario’ as hospital flu cases jump 55% in a weekRead moreThis winter is quite bad. It’s probably one of the worst we’ve had so far with the numbers of patients we’ve got coming in, and trusts will struggle differently depending on their infrastructure.My own trust is a very old hospital, with quite dated wards and architecture, which means we don’t have enough single rooms to actually isolate patients in.It’s at the level across most hospitals at the moment wherecorridor carehas been normal. The danger now is corridor care is normalised, and patients are coming in with respiratory infections, which makes it much more challenging to try to maintain your infection control. It is challenging.Graph showing flu rates over last four yearsI would really recommend to patients, if they’ve got symptoms that would go with the flu or with the cold, to try to stay at home if possible. Do self care, go on to theNHS 111app or the website. If not, they can always go to their GP or even go to their pharmacy.In the vast majority of cases, managing the flu is really self-help. Just wait for things to settle down. But if you do need emergency care – you feel extremely short of breath or anything of concern – then, you know, we’re always there in the hospital to take care of people.Starmer says resident doctors would be irresponsible to strike in face of flu crisisRead moreIt’s affecting all age groups. The vast majority are frail and elderly, because they have less respiratory reserve. But we’re also getting some young patients coming in with the flu and [it’s] hitting them badly.Flu itself can be a killer. It can be a dangerous disease if it’s not treated appropriately. Elderly people will die, and some young people will die from this as well.If you are a high-risk individual, all I would say, and for everyone, is make sure you get your immunisations if you’re in one of those categories that has it for free – including school-age children – because then you decrease the risk to your friends and relatives.The pressure builds up. First and foremost in the emergency departments, and then it goes around the wards.Everyone works really hard over the winter period and we expect winter is always going to be our busiest period, but it is especially hard. What you have to remember is that when the general public go down, a lot of our nurses and doctors and staff are going down as well.”Explore more on these topicsNHSFluHospitalsDoctorsHealth policyInfectious diseasesHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

There are one or two nice lines and sharp moments but they are submerged in a treacly soup of sentimentality; in the end, I couldn’t get past the cartoony quasi-Richard Curtis characterisation and the weird not-quite-earthlingness of the people involved. Having said this, I am aware of having been first in the queue to denigrateWinslet’s Christmas film The Holiday, that is regarded by many as one of the most successful films of all time.Helen Mirren is the June of the title, an affectionate but sharp-tongued matriarch who is diagnosed with terminal cancer in the run-up to Christmas, and her entire quarrelling clan will have to assemble in her hospital room. June, with a kind of benign cunning, realises that she can use her last days as a cathartic crisis that will cure her adult children’s unspoken hurt. They are a stressed careerist (Winslet), a stay-at-home mum (Andrea Riseborough), a hippy-dippy natural birth counsellor (Toni Collette) and a troubled soul (Johnny Flynn), plus all their various kids. There is also June’s daft old husband Bernie, played by Timothy Spall, who likes a drink and can’t talk about his feelings, and whose scatterbrained goofiness has a sad origin. Stephen Merchant plays Riseborough’s lovably useless husband and a gentle hospital nurse, played by Fisayo Akinade, is the ensemble’s self-effacing guide to a wiser future.It is an impressive cast with everyone giving their considerable all, and in fact Winslet delivers a rather impressively restrained, controlled performance, and perhaps less broad than everyone else’s. She and Riseborough have a big setpiece confrontation scene out in the grim hospital corridor by the chocolate machine and it’s well-managed – you wouldn’t expect anything less with actors of that calibre; it’s better, I think, than the comparable scene between Flynn and Spall, which is resolved in a wordless musical montage. In the end, it is Bernie who realises that time is running out, and some liberties will have to be taken with the calendar if June, on her morphine drip, is to witness the Christmas Day nativity scene that June’s children and grandchildren have promised to put on for her.There’s nothing wrong with a weepie or big emotional moments, but for me Goodbye June is too unreal, too contrived in its sugary farewell.Goodbye June is in cinemas from 12 December, and on Netflix from 24 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFamily filmsKate WinsletHelen MirrenAndrea RiseboroughToni CollettereviewsShareReuse this content"

She woke up to a friend banging on her bedroom window, and had to quickly do her hair before rushing to the venue, a dreamy castle in Chattanooga,Tennessee. Fortunately, the rest of the day went smoothly, and on the afternoon of 18 October, she walked down the aisle in a big white dress to be wed to her husband. And her wife.“Your favorite throuple got hitched,” Margaret French, 32, Janie’s wife, captioned an Instagrampostabout the day.The wedding was ceremonial, says Margaret, a marketing director and owner of Margaret French Presents, a company that hosts “creative escapes”. “We can’t get legally married. That would be bigamy,” she adds. (Bigamy, or being married to multiple people at the same time, is illegal in all 50 states.)She, Janie, and their husband, Cody Coppola, 36, have been together since 2016. Cody, a sales rep, and Margaret got legally married in 2018, mostly for insurance purposes. Janie, a communications manager, is not technically married to either of them, but all three refer to each other as spouses.They also worked with a legal expert to pull together documents that would allow them “to get as close as you can get to legally married without being legally married”, Margaret explains. These include wills, life insurance and power of attorney. The throuple co-owns a house in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Janie is in the process of legally taking Cody’s last name.Having a wedding ceremony was important to the spouses.“Doing the big, public wedding where we spent way too much money and invited too many people was our way of saying: this is real, this is legit, we’ve been together almost a decade and this is our celebration of that,” Margaret says.Margaret and Janie discussed what it was like to plan a wedding for three. (Cody was unavailable – “getting the three of us right now is nearly impossible,” Margaret says.)View image in fullscreen‘Doing the big, public wedding where we spent way too much money and invited too many people was our way of saying: this is real,’ French says.Photograph: Brian Storey/Margaret FrenchGetting togetherMargaret French: Cody and I met on Tinder in January 2016. Cody and I pretty much partnered up immediately, and we moved in together after nine months. We were monogamous for half a second. We started dating other women very casually, and then, in November, we met Janie. It was supposed to be a hookup, and then she never went home.It took a while to make it official – we were best friends with benefits for over a year.Janie Coppola: Almost two years.MF: Almost two years. In the six months before we got married, Cody and I were like, ‘Oh, we’re in love with Janie.’ So we defined our relationship, and Janie became our partner.JC: I had told Maggie that I loved her a couple of months before she got married to Cody [in 2018]. And by [the time of that] wedding, I had not told Cody I loved him.MF: We progressed at different rates.JC: I did [tell him] shortly after that. It wasn’t super serious until right around that point, and then it happened very quickly.I was one of 14 guests at their wedding. It was very small. Maggie’s whole family knew about me. Cody hadn’t told his family yet. He was waiting until after the wedding.Maggie and Cody both checked on me throughout the day to make sure I was doing okay. We spent the whole day together. I helped them get ready, and I provided breakfast for the wedding party. I was like the maid of honor. It was really sweet and special to be included.MF: Cody and I got married because we loved each other, but also for insurance. So it was romantic and beautiful and all of that, but we wouldn’t have gotten married that quickly if it weren’t for insurance. It was not the fairytale dream wedding, which is why we did this one.We all moved to Tennessee in 2020, and that’s when we were like, we’ve made this cross-country move and we have three cats together – we are a family for all intents and purposes, and we want to get married.The proposalMF: In 2022, we got engaged. Janie knew something was happening. She had picked out her ring, but we didn’t tell her when we purchased it.We did a photoshoot with a friend of ours who was a photographer. I told Janie that we were just doing a fun photoshoot with a friend. Then Cody showed up, and we did a surprise proposal, which was very cute.The bachelorette(s) partyMF: We planned on getting married in 2024. But at the beginning of 2021, we had bought a house that was condemned and spent 18 months and all of our money renovating it. We looked at how much we still owed on the house, the renovation, and how much we wanted to spend on a wedding, and decided to wait another year.We also decided to have a big bachelorette party. So we delayed the wedding, but had the bachelorette party in 2024. We went to New Orleans, and paid for an AirBnB for 22 people. That sounds insane until you think of it as two bachelorette parties – 11 people each. It’s still a lot.Cody didn’t have a bachelor party. He and his buddies play Dungeons and Dragons and they’ll do board game nights. I think they had a special D&D weekend while we were gone.The planningMF: Janie took care of all the logistics, and I took care of the aesthetics. I knew I wanted it to feel like a fairytale. A lot of that was decided when we found our venue, which looked like a castle.View image in fullscreen‘We didn’t have a wedding planner or coordinator. We did all the set up the day of,’ French says.Photograph: Brian Storey/Margaret FrenchJC: I did a lot of prep. I was the one who organized venue viewings, hired vendors, did the budget, the website, the registry, and the thank you cards. Maggie did decorations. She had a whole backdrop – she made a moon and a banner. She did flowers, candles and place cards. She and Cody made little 3D printed cats for each seat to represent which meal people were getting (it was very standard wedding food: chicken marsala, pasta primavera, or salmon).We had meetings once a week as a family where we would discuss if there were any outstanding issues and make sure that we were on track with the budget.MF: [Cody’s job was] he showed up on the day. And he paid. [Laughs.] He helped me a lot with my bigger builds. The finicky, technical stuff that I needed support on, that was him. One of the nice things about having three of us is if we needed him, we asked him for help and he did it.JC:But there was nothing that we initially really needed him for. Other than what he did do, which was helping with the seating chart. He also was managing our emotions, which is a full time job.MF: [While] building the house, we got past any difficulties about choosing stuff and who’s in charge. Once we got to the wedding, we were like, we’re good at this, we communicate really well.The wedding dayMF: We didn’t have a wedding planner or coordinator. We did all the set up the day of. I had spent the last eight months making everything. My best friend and I got to the venue at eight, then a bunch of family members showed up at nine, and we were pretty much fully set up by noon.JC: Not having a bridal party made everything so much easier. We weren’t managing anyone’s emotions but our own. It was wonderful. A day where everyone’s fawning all over you.MF: [At the ceremony] Cody did the traditional thing and walked up [the aisle] first. Since I had already gotten my white dress bride moment back in 2018, I wanted to make sure Janie had her big moment. I wore a buttery gold dress, and came out second. Janie came out last, and she was walked down the aisle by Cody’s dad and my mom.View image in fullscreen‘My advice to other polyamorous couples who want to get married is to be selfish, and make the day about you and your love,’ French says.Photograph: Brian Storey/Margaret FrenchJC: My mom could not come because she said it was against her religion. But I had both sides of their families walking me down and giving me away, and that was sweet.MF: We didn’t have any idea where we were going to stand until the rehearsal. My brother was the officiant, and we had him stand to the side of us instead of behind us. Janie and I were on either side of Cody, in a semi-circle angled toward the audience so everyone could see us.We created our own idea of what we wanted [a wedding] to be. Not being just two people, things automatically changed. We exchanged rings three times and there were four kisses total. [Each person kissed each other, and then Janie and Margaret kissed Cody’s cheeks.]Our first dance, we totally messed up. Our choreographer is our realtor. I told him I would send him a video of the dance, but I can’t. He was so excited, and it’s horrible. We decided we were going to do three groupings: [Janie] and I danced first and Cody stood to the side, then Janie went off and Cody and I danced. And then I went off and he and Janie danced. Then we just grabbed people. It kind of fell apart at the end.View image in fullscreen‘We weren’t managing anyone’s emotions but our own,” Janie Coppola says. “It was wonderful.”Photograph: Brian Storey/Margaret FrenchView image in fullscreen‘I knew I wanted it to feel like a fairytale,’ French says.Photograph: Brian Storey/Margaret FrenchWhat they learnedMF:My advice to other polyamorous couples who want to get married is to be selfish, and make the day about you and your love.JC: My number one piece of advice is don’t invite anyone you wouldn’t buy dinner for.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Despite being, you know, not a real person he was once treated with enough reverence to cause parent-led protests, a ban of all advertising and then of the film itself. It provided a sharp edge to an otherwise blunt and unremarkable post-Halloween knockoff and might help to explain why it managed to eke out four junky sequels and a 2012 remake.We’re now at the inevitablesecondremake stage but the 2025 redo arrives after the gimmick of Killer Santa has now become asubgenrein itself. He’s cropped up inChristmas Bloody Christmas, Christmas Evil, Santa’s Slay,Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale, Deadly Games and last year’sTerrifier 3and the makers of this December’s take are more than aware that seeing Santa with a weapon isn’t enough to shock today’s horror fans.Ella McCay review – James L Brooks returns with a sorry mess of a movieRead moreThe lengths to which writer-director Mike P Nelson then goes to in order to refresh and reinvigorate the formula can, in brief moments, be something to respect, a film-maker unwilling to churn out yet another slice-and-dice rehash (he previously tried to approach hisWrong Turn remakewith a similar ambition). But there’s almosttoomuch on his mind here, at least for one film to tackle, and so a straightforward slasher soon becomes a vaguely political, sometimes supernatural and strangely sentimental cross between TV shows like Dexter and You and films like Venom, Mr Brooks and Bill Paxton’s lesser-known 2001 effort Frailty, aChristmascocktail that could have done with fewer ingredients.One thing the film does stick with is the protagonist, poor little Billy Chapman, understandably traumatised at a young age after seeing his parents get brutally murdered by a criminal dressed as Santa. This time he’s played by Rohan Campbell, an actor best known for his role in another misbegotten franchise rejiggerHalloween Ends, and this time, we’re made to feel even sorrier for him. While yes, once again his adult response to his childhood trauma is murdering people while also dressed as Santa (not good!), his methods and motivation are a bit more – or one might saytoo– complicated. Every Christmas, Billy has an Advent calendar that demands a new kill every day, insisted upon by a gravelly voice in his head who acts as a supporting character throughout. After he’s drawn to a new town, he becomes fixated on a local woman who seems to share his propensity for violence, while also finding out about an unsolved mystery involving a spate of child disappearances. Oh, and there is also a local Nazi cult to deal with …Merv review – a dog steals the show in Amazon’s by-the-book Christmas romcomRead moreWhile Nelson’s desire to keep remixing the formula does keep those of us familiar with the original guessing, it often feels like change for the sake of change, aimed at surprising a niche audience who actually remember a deeply forgettable film. Those who arrive fresh to it will probably find his ideas a little too regifted to impress all that much. What might have seemed edgy a couple of decades ago (what if a fucked-up killer finds someone who isalsofucked up?) has now become the familiar stuff of a cable series and Nelson just can’t seem to decide how seriously we’re supposed to be taking any of this. He is either desperately trying to satiate the bloodthirsty Midnight Movie crowd with mushy gore, mass-slaughtering Nazis or pulverising heads, or he’s trying to add pathos to a character who really doesn’t deserve it, climaxing with an oddly pitched finale aimed less at making us vomit and more at making us cry. What none of the tonal shifts and story tweaks can do is distract us from his boringly flat direction, failing to justify why something so drab and cheap-looking would warrant the surprisingly wide theatrical release it’s receiving this weekend.Since the film it’s based on wasn’t all that good to begin with, there is nothing sacrilegious about yet another remake but there’s also no real point to it either. No one will be compelled to protest this time – they will be too indifferent to care.Silent Night, Deadly Night is out in cinemas on 12 DecemberExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsChristmasreviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Zain Jaafar/AFP/Getty ImagesAmong the many people I met, there was a pervasive feeling of hopelessness and a sense that resistance is slowly becoming a memoryByEwen MacAskillThu 11 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 04.52 ESTShareIn November, Israeli flags suddenly appeared beside a highway in the Palestinian West Bank. More than 1,000, placed about 30 yards apart on both sides of the road, stretching for roughly 10 miles. They were planted south of Nablus, close to Palestinian villages regularly targeted by extremist Israeli settlers. I saw the flags on my way to visit those villages, the morning after they were put up. Their message echoed the ubiquitous graffiti painted by settlers across the West Bank: “You have no future inPalestine.”Compared with the70,000 Palestinians killedin Gaza andmore than 1,000in the West Bank since October 2023, the flags amount to no more than a minor provocation. But they reflect how dominant Israel has become in the West Bank, land recognised under international law as belonging to the Palestinians. During the second intifada, the Palestinian uprising from 2000 to 2005, Israeli settlers would not have risked planting such flags, for fear of coming under fire from Palestinians. Not now.I returned to theWest Banklast month for the first time in 20 years. In the early 2000s, I had visited regularly as a correspondent for the Guardian, in support of Jerusalem-based colleagues covering the second intifada. The uprising was much more violent than the first, which ran from 1987 to 1993. The enduring image of the first is of Palestinian youths throwing rocks at Israeli soldiers. The second was a full-scale confrontation, with Israel attacking Palestinian cities and towns with artillery, tanks, helicopters and jets while Palestinians fought back with rifles and explosives. Palestinians ambushed soldiers and settlers in the West Bank, making roads a risky venture, especially at night, and terrorised Israel by sending suicide bombers across its border to attack bus stops, cafes, hotels and anywhere else that was crowded. More than 3,000 Palestinians and more than 1,000 Israelis were killed.I had not planned to write anything about my trip to the West Bank last month. But I changed my mind when I witnessed how much daily life for Palestinians had deteriorated, how dispirited they have become and how much controlIsraeland its settlers now exercise over the Palestinian population. I had expected conditions for Palestinians would be worse, but not this much worse.I had been invited to attend a conference at Birzeit University, on the outskirts of Ramallah, organised byProgressive International, a loose coalition of leftwing organisations and individuals worldwide founded in 2020 by, among others, the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and the US senator Bernie Sanders. The conference on the decolonisation of Palestine was organised jointly by Progressive International, the Palestinian thinktank Al-Shabaka and the Ibrahim Abu-Lughod Institute of International Studies at Birzeit. The university’s academics and students have had a long history of protest and clashes with Israeli forces, and the campus has been repeatedly raided by Israeli forces over the last two years.After the conference, a few attenders set off around the West Bank. I was curious as to why there had been no Palestinian uprising in the West Bank comparable to the second intifada, in support of their compatriots in Gaza. Curious, too, about how much support there was for Hamas in the West Bank, and whether anyone believed that an independent Palestinian state was something we might see in the next few decades. Their responses were varied and complex but consistent themes emerged. One was how demoralised they have become. The other was how far away the prospect of a sovereign independent Palestine now seemed.Ramallah, the political, cultural and economic centre of the West Bank, looked cleaner, less chaotic and in places, more prosperous than the last time I was there, not that different from many European cities, with billboards advertising restaurants, speciality chocolate shops and the opening of new gyms. Young, fashion-conscious Palestinians sat chatting in cafes and bars; according to some of the older generation, they are generally less concerned about politics.But this air of normality and prosperity is doubly deceptive. First, Ramallah is not typical of the rest of the West Bank. And second, one of the reasons Ramallah appears so different and less chaotic is the absence of so many of the villagers from surrounding areas who used to line the sides of the city’s streets with their piles of fruit and vegetables. Faced with an expanding maze of Israeli checkpoints and gates that make a journey uncertain, many farmers no longer make the trip to Ramallah. The obstacles are a deterrent not only to farmers but to trade and business generally throughout the West Bank.At the end of the second intifada, there were, according to the UN, 376 checkpoints and barriers in the West Bank. Today there arean estimated 849, many of them erected in the last two years. Checkpoints and barriers are a topic of conversation among Palestinians in much the same way weather is in the UK. While an app that provides information supplied by bus drivers and other road users helps, it is no guarantee, as I found, that roads will be open. The occupation is colour-coded: red metal barriers are closed much of the time, and yellow ones are open more frequently. Yellow Israeli number plates grant access to roads denied to those driving with green Palestinian plates.Israeli army incursions into the centre of Ramallah have become more common over the past two years. Israeli soldiers arrive in force, make arrests and leave. In a raid in August, they targeted currency exchanges, made five arrests and, according to Palestinians, left more than a dozen injured by live fire, rubber bullets or teargas.During a major incursion in 2002, Israel took over much of the city. Its tanks and bulldozers battered into the presidential compound, reducing much of it to ruins and besieging Yasser Arafat, then the Palestinian leader. The darkly lit, cramped rooms in which he was confined until close to his death in 2004 have been left intact, forming part of an Arafat mausoleum and museum. The remains of the compound are a symbol of defiance, from a time when Palestinians were united and there was a sense of hope.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian demonstrator uses a slingshot to throw stones at IDF vehicles on the outskirts of Ramallah, West Bank, September 2001.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/Getty ImagesOne of the biggest differences between the second intifada and the present day is that Arafat tacitly backed the uprising. His secular Fatah group fought alongside the Islamists – Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad – and the leftwing Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. By contrast, Arafat’s successor, Mahmoud Abbas, who was elected president in 2005, has resisted pressure over the past two years to launch a new uprising in the West Bank. Abbas’s decision is unpopular among Palestinians in the West Bank, according to polls and the Palestinians I spoke to.Among the few I found who supported Abbas’s decision was Maher Canawati, the mayor of Bethlehem, who, like Abbas and Arafat, is a member of Fatah. He said Abbas had faced lots of criticism. “People wanted him to say: ‘Let’s go fight.’” But the president’s caution had been vindicated, Canawati said. “People in the West Bank understood that this was not the time to do what they did in the first and second intifada. We do not want to give them an excuse to attack us. We are helpless. We are not at the same level as the Israelis,” Canawati said. “If we decided to go with an uprising, it would give them the green light to retaliate as they did in Gaza.”From the mayor’s office, it is possible to see the Church of the Nativity, where steps lead to a grotto celebrated by Christians as the birthplace of Jesus. In 2002, during the second intifada, Israeli forces held the church under siege for 39 days, firing at Palestinian militants holed up inside. Few tourists realise that close to the steps to the grotto, the bodies of the Palestinian dead had been left to rot. Not that there are that many tourists these days. Canawati, a Christian whose family has lived in Bethlehem since the 17th century and owns The Three Arches, one of the biggest suppliers in Palestine of biblical souvenirs, said tourism had dwindled to almost zero in the past two years.It is not just tourism that is suffering. The economy of the West Bank as a whole is dire. Per capita, income is down 20% andunemploymenthovers around 33%. On top of this, while the population is suffering, the Palestinian Authority, nominally responsible for administration of the West Bank and run by Fatah, is synonymous with corruption, embezzlement, dodgy contracts and nepotism. Palestinians I spoke to were incensed by the way jobs were so often awarded not on merit but on family links, contacts, backhanders or political affiliation.It is not hard to find examples. While wandering around the centre of Tulkarm, in the north of the West Bank, a stall-holder called me over to chat. He said he had been a star student at university, gained a degree in law and proudly showed his membership card of the Palestinian bar association. So why was he working at a fruit and vegetable stall? He said he just did not have contacts inside the PA that would open the way to a legal career.Canawati acknowledged there was corruption but softened this admission by adding “like other countries”. Given the unpopularity of Abbas, the PA and Fatah, I asked Canawati how Hamas would fare if there was to be an election in the West Bank. Hamas would have “no chance”, he said, though almost everyone else I spoke predicted Hamas would win. In the absence of national legislative elections – there have been none since 2006 – student council elections at Birzeit University are viewed as a barometer of sorts. In thelast election in 2023, before 7 October, an Islamist bloc affiliated to Hamas won 25 of the 51 seats while a Fatah-affiliated group took 20 and one affiliated to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine took six.Raising the 7 October massacre, in which more than 1,200 Israelis and foreigners were killed and about 250 taken hostage, invariably provoked a strong reaction. Why, Palestinians would angrily ask, take 7 October as a starting point? Why not start with repeated Israeli airstrikes on Gaza that left thousands dead between 2005 and 2023? They viewed Hamas as part of the resistance and few that I met were prepared to criticise the attack.One of the exceptions was Omar Haramy, director of Sabeel, a centre for Palestinian liberation theology based in Jerusalem. In his view, Palestinian civil society’s failure to have a serious discussion about the massacre is a problem. As we spoke, he was standing near the Jaffa Gate entrance to the Old City of Jerusalem, close to Israel’s Kishle police station. Haramy, who said he had been held there and questioned many times, suggested that if Palestinians had put pressure on Hamas early on, maybe they would have released the children, women and elderly people who had been taken hostage. “Is this the values we want as Palestinians? To take babies as hostages? For God’s sake. This is not who we are.” He viewed the various factions and political parties as a burden in the push for liberation. “They are all complicit, with no elections, with no vision. It’s all sad and messed up.”The most serious change since my last visit to the region is the expansion of Israeli settlements. There are 3.3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank, including 435,000 in East Jerusalem. The number of Israeli settlers has jumped from 400,000 at the time of the second intifada to more than 700,000 now. But those figures do not convey the extent of the encroachment of the settlements, their suffocating impact, occupying more hilltops overlooking cities, towns and villages and even setting up in the middle of them, behind walls and barbed wire, often only yards from Palestinian homes, and protected by Israeli soldiers.During the second intifada, I interviewed the leader of a small settlement in the centre of Hebron, whose population was overwhelmingly Palestinian. When I asked him what he thought of Palestinians, he replied they were “animals”. When I told him I would quote him, he did not attempt to retract the statement. I have never been able to shake off the memory of that casual contempt. But it seems tame in comparison with what is happening today, as settlers, encouraged by extremists in the Israeli cabinet, harass Palestinians with increasing frequency and viciousness, rampaging through villages with impunity, intimidating Palestinians in an attempt to drive them out.About 10 miles from Hebron is the hillside village of Umm al-Khair, infamous as the scene of violent confrontations with settlers. Eid Siliman Hathaleen, a Palestinian Bedouin and community activist from the village, said the Bedouins had bought the land in 1952 but settlers and the Israeli army are conducting a sustained campaign against them. Palestinian homes have been demolished while settlers expand their presence. Seven new mobile homes appeared overnight in October in the middle of the village, while an Israeli order had come to demolish a further 14 Palestinian homes.View image in fullscreenRelatives and friends of Palestinian activist Awdah Hathaleen gather in Umm al-Kheir in August to mourn his death the previous month.Photograph: Tamir Kalifa/Getty ImagesThe village, like the rest of the West Bank, is under constant surveillance from cameras, military vehicles and drones. While we chatted, Israeli soldiers arrived. An hour before, Israeli peace activists who had turned up in a show of solidarity with the villagers were moved after soldiers declared the location a closed military zone, Hathaleen said. The soldiers told us the place we were standing was now too designated a closed military zone.While Hathaleen and young soldiers argued about the military order, a senior figure in uniform, heavily armed and wearing a black balaclava and dark glasses joined us. Exasperated by the exchanges, he eventually said: “You have four minutes. Go. Goodbye.” Hathaleen, who said the soldiers had come at the request of settlers, filmed the confrontation on his phone, a potentially risky provocation – but one that ended peacefully. Hathaleen said his father, Siliman Hathleen, also a community activist fighting against demolitions, died after being hit by an Israeli police truck in 2022. His cousin, Awdah Hathaleen, a consultant on the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, wasshot dead in the villageby a settler in July.In Palestinian villages south of Nablus, representatives of agricultural cooperatives and women’s organisations told us of attacks from settlers descending from the hilltops to beat them up, destroy property and spread a poisonous white powder that killed crops. In one village, farmers, coming up with ingenious ways to counter this, had started growing vegetables in barrels filled with uncontaminated soil.Is it possible that anger with Israeli military incursions and settler attacks – not to mention the destruction of Gaza – will provoke large-scale retaliation, a third intifada, in the West Bank? The Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research,in a poll in October, found 49% of Palestinians in the West Bank – and 30% in Gaza – still favoured armed struggle as the most effective way to achieve a Palestinian state.Abdaljawad Omar, assistant professor of philosophy at Birzeit, who goes under the pen name Abboud Hamayel, is sceptical about the possibility. He has written a forthcoming book about the Palestinian resistance. He does not advocate a return to violence but regretted the prevailing fatigue and paralysis, what he calls “emotional hollowing”. He said: “Anger has mutated into impotent resentment. Today stones are seldom thrown in the West Bank. This is something new … Resistance is slowly becoming a memory.”The hotbed of resistance in the second intifada was the refugee camps, many of which date back to 1948, when roughly 750,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled from their homes in what became the state of Israel. At the entrance to the Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem there is an arch above which rests a huge key, symbolising the hope that one day its inhabitants might go back to Israel to reclaim their former homes. Around the walls of the camp are murals that range from a commemoration of Palestinian heroes, such as stone-throwing youths andguerilla fighter Leila Khaled, to an unflattering painting of US president Donald Trump. Rushing to prayers at midday one Friday, residents had little time to talk but were dismissive of the ceasefire in Gaza – “What ceasefire?” – and ridiculed Trump’s plan for a Gaza Riviera.The one-tonne metal key fixed above the arch and the murals celebrating resistance feel like symbols from a bygone age, an era that is slipping away, not least because the dream of the refugees of a return to their original homes in Israel is almost certainly never going to be fulfilled. I interviewed a father in another of the camps in Bethlehem during the second intifada who was adamant he, like the other residents, would not leave the camp other than to return to his original home. Does that diehard stubbornness still exist? A former resident of the camps expressed surprise on hearing that families who had been among the most intractable were considering for the first time leaving, ground down, in part, by unemployment, poverty and debt.View image in fullscreenPalestinians manufacture a giant symbolic key to mark the 60th anniversary of the Palestinian Nakba (Day of Catastrophe), in the Aida refugee camp near Bethlehem, May 2008.Photograph: Mahfouz Abu Turk/ReutersThe Israeli military is not waiting for them to leave. Earlier this year the IDF demolished large parts of the three of the camps that have been on the frontline of resistance, during the second intifada and since 2023, all three in the north of the West Bank. Israel described the three as “hubs of terror”: Tulkarm, Nur Shams and Jenin. Palestinians said the Israeli military, through flyers and loudspeakers, warned the residents of Aida and other camps they, too, will be destroyed unless they behave.When the Israelis mounted an incursion into the Jenin refugee camp in 2002, they met fierce resistance. I interviewed an Israeli sergeant at the time, Israel Kaspi, a combat veteran who had seen service in the Yom Kippur war in 1973 and in Lebanon in 1982, who saidthe fighting in Jeninhad been the most intense he had ever been involved in. The Palestinians had turned the refugee camp into a fortress, he said. Israel lost 23 soldiers as they fought from street to street, house to house, and room to room, amid booby-traps, explosives hidden in alleyways and in rubbish bins, dynamite sealed inside walls, and Palestinians firing from well-prepared positions.Earlier this year, when they attacked the camps in Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams, the Israelis lost three soldiers but managed to empty the camps of a combined total of 30,000 residents, shattering close-knit communities and dispersing them to temporary accommodation elsewhere in the West Bank. An estimated 850 homes and other buildings were destroyed across the three camps.On a visit to the camps at Tulkarm and Nur Shams last month, I could see tracks of tanks or bulldozers in the muddy road but nothing inside, partly because it was dark but also because venturing further is dangerous. The Israeli military had warned that anyone trying to enter the camps would be shot. This was not an empty threat: three days latera cameraman, Fady Yasmeen, was shotduring a protest near the entrance.I travelled to Tulkarm with Aseel Tork, who works for a not-for-profit organisation that runs community projects in rural areas, in particular for women and the young, the Bisan Centre for Research and Development. It was designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel in 2021, a move condemned by, among others, the United Nations office of the high commissioner of human rights. Tork told me that she believed a third intifada is impossible now. “When the first and second intifadas happened, the Palestinian community as a whole was looking out for one another. There were fewer divisions among us: ideologically, politically, geographically. Right now, we cannot – and have not – stood up for the people in Gaza the way we should have. If an intifada was going to happen, it would have happened after 7 and 8 October.”At an event in Ramallah in November, titled Poetry after Gaza, a Kafka quote came up in conversation between a European and a Palestinian. I was to hear it again twice during the week from Palestinians in other settings. “Plenty of hope – for God, an infinite amount of hope – only not for us.”Where do Palestinians look for hope? Few answers are forthcoming. An overhaul of the Palestinian Authority? Elections are long overdue – but problematic from an international standpoint, given the level of professed support for Hamas. Is a two-state solution, an independent Palestine and Israel side by side, even viable, given how much land settlers now occupy in the West Bank? A one-state solution, with Israel as an enlarged apartheid state, in which Palestinians could fight for equal rights, backed by the international community, as in South Africa? One weary Palestinian writer, after declaring the two-state solution dead, said he would settle for a one-state solution if it just meant he would finally be able to move about freely.View image in fullscreenThe border wall at Aida refugee camp, December 2023.Photograph: Adri Salido/Anadolu/Getty ImagesA global campaign began last month for the release of Marwan Barghouti, widely regarded as the figure likeliest to unify the Palestinians. Barghouti, accused by Israel of being the leader of Fatah militants in the West Bank during the second intifada, has been in an Israeli jail since 2002, convicted on five counts of murder, which he denies. The longstanding Palestinian hope is that he could emerge from there as a Palestinian Nelson Mandela. Although he is Fatah, he is popular among supporters of Hamas and the other factions. Iinterviewed Barghouti in Ramallahthe year before he was captured and wrote then that I thought he could a future leader. He was impressive but did not have the warmth of Mandela and to me he seemed, maybe unfairly, to be more of a street fighter than a political visionary. But perhaps he has changed while in prison, as Mandela did. Barghouti has been held in solitary confinement since the 7 October attack and beenbeaten by prison guardsfour times, the last, in September this year, leaving him unconscious, according to his son Arab.Barghouti was on a list of prisoners Hamas submitted to Israel to be freed as part of the October ceasefire deal. Although Israel released others convicted of murder, it refused to release Barghouti. Its decision may reflect Israel’s preference for a weak, malleable Palestinian leader, Abbas, to a potentially more forceful figure.Basem Ezbidi, a leading political scientist and member of the Al-Shabaka thinktank, who was at university with Barghouti, cautioned against expecting a political saviour. “In times of despair, people tend to create myths in which a superhero comes to the rescue,” he said. “People see Marwan Barghouti in that way. But he is not a man who makes miracles. He may be cleaner than others but it is not enough to be clean: you have to have the political skills and the right vision.”With a shortage of options from within, many Palestinians see the international community as their best hope, believing a turning point has been reached because of worldwide outrage over the destruction of Gaza. At the Birzeit conference, Saleh Hijazi, a policy coordinator for the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) National Committee, said more pressure had to be put on Israel by ending military ties, enforcing arrest warrants against Israelis accused of war crimes, divestment from complicit companies and expelling Israel from international bodies such as the UN, Fifa and the Olympics. Action is already being taken at state level, as in Malaysia, which closed down ports to Israeli ships, and even in Europe, he said. “We can now begin to see our South Africa moment arrive. But more escalation of BDS is needed.”Such campaigns might work in the long run, as they did in South Africa. But in the short or medium term they will not change the lives of Palestinians in the West Bank, caught between a Palestinian Authority that cannot protect them and Israel, with its military clampdown and its out-of-control settlers. While the body count in the West Bank was higher during the second intifada, life was absolutely worse now in every other way, said Budour Hassan, a legal researcher at Amnesty International. Hassan, who is from Nazareth, said: “Even back then there was hope, maybe. Now the people seem completely desperate. They feel completely abandoned.”BDS: how a controversial non-violent movement has transformed the Israeli-Palestinian debateRead moreFor the past two years, Manger Square in Bethlehem has been deliberately left in darkness and silence at Christmas time in a show of solidarity with Gaza. On 6 December, the Bethlehem mayor relit the Christmas tree in front of thousands of Palestinians – Muslims as well as Christians – and a scattering of visitors from around the world. Canawati hoped the resumption of festivities will revive tourism. He viewed the relighting of the tree as a symbol of hope and resilience.“Those who lost hope, they have left,” Canawati told me. (Since 2023, an estimated 4,000 Palestinians have left Bethlehem for abroad.) “I will never leave, regardless of what is going to happen. I know there are many like me,” Canawati said. Describing himself as an optimist, he hoped the reaction to Gaza will push world leaders into supporting the Palestinian cause, and that negotiations initiated by Trump will lead to a peace deal and a sovereign Palestinian state.But he tempered this with dismay over extremists in the Israeli cabinet and among the settlers. Echoing the despair I found around the West Bank, the mayor said: “The extremists do not want a two-state solution or a one-state solution. The extremists do not want to give us our state or be part of their state. They want the land without the people. They just want us gone.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readWest BankPalestineIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s not even a fortnight since the government agreed toraise the prices the NHS pays for new medicinesand here comes the boss of GSK, Britain’s second largest pharma firm, to extol the virtues of doing business in the US.The US is “still the leading market in the world in terms of the launches of new drugs and vaccines”,said the chief executive, Emma Walmsley, ina BBC interview, explaining why GSK invests about three times as much over there as it does at home. Alongside China, the US is also “the best market in the world to do business development”.Her comments have caused a stir but, actually, are merely a statement of reality. It would be absurd to pretend the UK has suddenly shot to the top of the competitiveness table in life sciences as a result of the multipronged price and tariffs deal at the start of this month.Yes, the UK retains excellent research facilities, links with universities and other soft “ecosystem” benefits – successive governments’ boasts about the UK being a life sciences “superpower” are not wholly fanciful. But the US remains streets ahead in terms of what it spends on new drugs, the depth of its research and manufacturing bases and the funding its startups and biotech businesses can raise. That’s just how things are.But, as Walmsley also said, this month’s deal onNHSprices and tariffs is welcome. Critics complain the terms represent a capitulation to big pharma and Trump. But what else was the government supposed to do? If it is serious about the “superpower” stuff, it had to avert tensions that existed long before the president threatened to impose tariffs at nose-bleed rates on UK pharma exports to the US.View image in fullscreenGSK’s Emma Walmsley is the latest UK pharma chief to talk up opportunities in the US.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesQuarrels over NHS pricing were plainly related to lost investments in the UK, such asMerck’s scrapping of a £1bn ­research centre in London. One issue was the complicated “voluntary” price scheme, which tries to promote innovation while protecting the NHS budget via a cap. Companies’ rebate payments have been unpredictable and last year’s tally was 23% of sales, far above comparable rates in other large European countries. The other issue is the price the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) allows the NHS to spend on life-extending drugs.The deal wrapped the items together. The UK got zero tariffs on exports to the US for three years. The price rebate was capped at 15%. And Nice raised its baseline price thresholds by 25% at the lower end.Cue the complaints about NHS budgets being diverted from frontline equipment and hospitals. Yes, that is undeniably a risk: the health service’s spending on pharmaceuticals will rise by £3bn a year. But the alternative was less investment in the UK, which might create even more pressure on budgets over time and even less access for patients to new medicines. In a world of trade-offs, and from a tricky negotiating position, the government looks to have landed in roughly the right spot. A deal had to happen,as argued here many times.Walmsley called it “a step in the right direction”, which is positive but not a five-star review. That is probably also fair. The plan is for the UK to double to 0.6% the percentage of GDP spent on new medicines over a decade, which leaves plenty of time for tensions to flare again. Meanwhile, the terms of the post-2029 “voluntary” scheme also have to be negotiated.But other projects are happening in the wings, such as the £600m-backed Health Data Research Service, which aims to “turbocharge access to NHS data for researchers” by exploiting the health service’s strength as a unified system. At a time when the government’s industrial strategy seems to bemoving in slow motion on several fronts, the position in life sciences could easily have been worse.

What it is not traditionally known for is honesty. I live in Los Angeles, work in the entertainment industry when I’m not moonlighting as a semi-reputable journalist and have done my fair share of lying … or, more accurately, omitting the truth. One of the least pleasant experiences in town is being asked to give honest feedback to someone who is at best an acquaintance. It’s worse yet if that person is a friend, lover or family member who actually takes your opinion seriously. Overall, the notion of offering honesty to a peer is akin to rubbing poison oak on your privates.And yet, despite knowing how gruesome this can be, I still solicit feedback on scripts, films and even nascent ideas I’m toying with. Naturally, I feel guilty doing it. I blubber about how gracious the person is for taking the time to engage with my creative output, how generous they are and how crucial this step is to any sort of actual success in the industry. I’m even lying when I say that to someone. I should tell them: “I’m sorry I just asked you to do the equivalent of punching several of your own teeth out for free. Please don’t destroy my self-esteem completely. Let my mother finish the job.”Look again at the Nuzzi affair. Because when our politics and media are so debased, the joke’s on us | Nesrine MalikRead moreWhen someone is brutally forthcoming with their true feelings about something or someone in Hollywood, it’s absolutely jarring. We all signed a metaphorical pact to never divulge what we actually believe, to always spare the feelings of someone who could speak ill of us later and to be, at most, highly passive-aggressive or sarcastic. I’ve lived here for nearly 20 years, and I like it this way. I used to imagine there was a level of success that afforded you the opportunity to opt out of the Hollywood social contract. I don’t know if Orson Wellesever had a nice thing to say about another person in the film business, but at least he was funny about it. As you know, he’s dead now, so he doesn’t have to worry about getting dragged on social media for calling Humphrey Bogart a coward. Quentin Tarantino, however, is very much not dead and still lobbing bombs at his sole discretion.The latest object of Tarantino’s ire is the actor Paul Dano, who, according to Tarantino, single-handedly ruined Paul Thomas Anderson’s masterpiece There Will Be Blood. Tarantino appeared on Bret Easton Ellis’s podcast and declared Dano“the weakest fucking actor in Sag” and “the limpest dick in the world”. He doesn’t simply dislike the man’s work. He thinks he is the worst working actor in America. That would include LeBron James, who is presumably a Sag member after starring in the Razzie award-winning Space Jam: A New Legacy. Would swapping King James for Dano as Eli Sunday make There Will Be Blood a better film, then? Only if there’s a scene of Eli dunking onDaniel Plainview.Since this is Hollywood, no one has come out and agreed with Tarantino, but numerous big names havepublicly supported Dano. This is far from the first time Tarantino has come for a beloved movie fixture. In 1992, Tarantinoroundly panned David Lynch’s Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Meafter it premiered at the Cannes film festival, declaring that “David Lynch has disappeared so far up his own ass that I have no desire to see another David Lynch movie until I hear something different”. That film was a notorious bomb that was booed at Cannes, so it was a safe opinion to have at the time. But today, Fire Walk With Me has been reappraised by critics and audiences, and is now considered one of the late director’s finest works. Whoops.Tarantino has been piercing the veil of Hollywood decorum for decades now, but it seems that he finally picked the wrong target. Dano is 41 years old, but has the cherubic face of a teenager who spends most of his time sorting Pokémon cards. You want to pinch his cheeks and ruffle his hair, then tell him: “Go get ’em, champ.” Making fun of Dano is like kicking a bunny at a birthday party. He looks like the counselor at a Lutheran summer camp. How can you hate that guy?Whywould you hate that guy? You’re picking on the quiet accountant who brings homemade brownies for everyone at work. More importantly, you’re breaking the social pact of the entertainment business: never, ever say anything cruel about someone who’s successful, even if you sincerely believe it.When a person violates this unwritten rule, they behave as if they are above the law. What all of this makes clear is that no one is successful enough to be honest, and that you can be an acclaimed filmmaker and still be completely wrong about art. I will go on lying, omitting and smiling when all I want to do is frown. If Tarantino can’t get away with it, why would I?Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going off to finish the third act of my Space Jam 3 spec script. I think Dano would be great opposite Bugs Bunny.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsQuentin TarantinoOpinionPaul DanocommentShareReuse this content"

British livesAditya ChakraborttyMore than £3bn that could have been used for UK patients will go to big pharma for its branded products – money for care siphoned off for profitThu 11 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 11.23 ESTShareOf Arthur Scargill it was said that he began each day with two newspapers. The miners’ leader read the Morning Star of course, but only after consulting the Financial Times. Why did a class warrior from Yorkshire accord such importance to the house journal of pinstriped Londoners? Before imbibing views, he told a journalist, he wanted“to get the facts”.In that spirit, let us parse a deal just struck by the governments of Donald Trump and Keir Starmer. You may not have heard much about this agreement on medicine, but it is huge in both financial and political significance – and Downing Street could not be more proud.A“world-beating deal,”boasts the science minister, Patrick Vallance. It “paves the way for the UK to become a global hub for life sciences,” claims the business secretary, Peter Kyle, with the government press release adding: “Tens of thousands of NHS patients will benefit.”Presented with such triumph, His Majesty’s press is up on its hindlegs. “Happy pills” ran a laudatory editorial in the Times, while the Daily Mail sportingly thanked Donald Trump for his “US lifeline for UK pharma”.Britain 1, America 0! Except that’snot the view from Washington. “A major win for American workers,” says the trade secretary, Howard Luttnick, which “ensures that the breakthroughs of tomorrow will be built, tested, and produced on American soil.” The health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, acclaims “results that put Americans first”.One deal, two diametrically opposed readings: who is right? The answer, I regret to inform you, is the Trumpettes. Take this headline from the liberals at the New York Times: “To avoid tariffs, UK agrees to Trump’s demand to pay more for drugs”.Starmer and his team have not only been handed a costly defeat; they are misleading you and me about what it means for ourNHS, our future treatment, our lives.Because modelling suggests this will almost certainly cost British lives. Before any agreement was signed, there was an estimate from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) last month that branded medicines could soon cost the NHSan extra £3bn a year. That £3bn extra does not buy us anything – it is more money for the same medicines.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, denies it will cost as much, but when I asked the Department of Health how he made those calculations I got no answer. I have also spoken to independent experts who think this brilliant deal will cost more, not less. For the sake of argument, let’s go with a cost of £3bn a year.Reading between the lines of Streeting’s statements, this money will have to be found fromthe NHS’s own budget. That £3bn will be have to be found each year by giving fewer cancer scans, longer waits for ambulances and at A&E, and delays on surgery.There appears to be no government assessment of what this means – and again neither Streeting’s ministry nor the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology were able to provide one. So I went to Karl Claxton, a professor at the University of York and an expert on the economics of NHS medicines. His modelling, based on years of evidence on the impacts of cuts to health budgets suggests that this deal, celebrated up and down Whitehall and hailed in the Times and the Daily Mail, will mean 15,971 more dead people every year. (If Streeting’s estimate is right, then the number of extra deaths will fall, although only as far as 6,192 – a comparative bargain.) They won’t know that they’ve died in the service of a deal that provides extra profits to some of the richest companies in the world but Claxton’s view is that the link is “causal”. This deal, he says, is “a catastrophe for all NHS patients”.This is quite possibly the first time you’ve read about this agreement and what it means. Just as with theAI deal stuck by Starmera few weeks ago, there is no paperwork, no official evidence, no vote attached to this. All you have is a Whitehall press release. While national newspapers have been keen to cover the resident doctors’ pay dispute, with 76 stories over the past month according to the Guardian’s research department, they have devoted only 13 stories to this deal, which in financial terms is far bigger.It also represents a larger threat to our medical system. Unlike the disaster capitalism that reigns over much of US healthcare, the NHS tightly regulates approved drugs, to ensure they offer value for money and that manufacturers do not rake off too much profit. The result is that pills and injections in the US are on averagethree times more expensivethan in the UK. For an object lesson in how to use the power of the public sector to reduce the cost of essentials and attack profiteering, look no further than the NHS’s drug regime. No wonder the pharmaceutical industry hates it.Its best chance of undermining it has come with Trump’s return to the Oval Office. After promising voters he would lower the cost of living and create more jobs, he demanded pharmaceutical companies invest more in the US and charge Americans less for their medicine. He has also slapped tariffs on the goods the rest of the world sells to the US, which includes a few billion-pounds-worth of British-made serums and tablets. And so Downing Street was set on a collision course with AstraZeneca, Merck (called MSD in Europe) and other billion-pound businesses.Things came to a head in the middle of September, with an extraordinary sequence of events. First, MSD scrapped plans for a research centre in King’s Cross, north London, even though it was already under construction. On the same day, the industry’s main lobby group warned about the relatively low prices paid by the NHS for medicines, saying that “in many global boardrooms, the UK is now viewed as a contagion risk with practices that, if adopted by other markets, would threaten the sector’s ability to invest and innovate globally”. Within 24 hours, Eli Lilly, maker of Prozac and Mounjaro, appeared in a trade journalpulling plans for a labalready agreed with the government. Its boss later slammed the UK as “probably the worst country in Europe” for drug prices. The next day, AstraZenecapaused a project in Cambridgethat was supposed to create 1,000 jobs.These announcements“look very coordinated from the outside”, one senior government official confided to journalists. “I’ve never seen anything like this before, it’s actually pretty sinister.” The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry denies any claims of collusion.And so we end up with a deal that has barely been explained to the people whom it will most directly hurt. Meanwhile, we have a government hailing as a victory what is actually a singular and costly capitulation, and holding on to lame promises that these drugmakers will invest in the UK. As Sally Gainsbury of the health thinktank the Nuffield Trust says, it is now “part of a Ponzi scheme, buying treatments that aren’t the best use of money”.An organisation devoted to saving lives is now being used as part of trade deals, its precious resources and structural integrity haggled away to multinational companies and foreign bullies.Labournever ceases to remind voters that it gave them the NHS, yet in chasing the unicorn of fabulous economic growth its leaders are now changing the very purpose of its proudest creation.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionHealthLabourPharmaceuticals industryTariffsTrump administrationTrade policycommentShareReuse this content"

People no longer want Brexit triumphalism, but things that actually workThu 11 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 08.01 ESTShareWhat’s in a name? A government minister has a good answer for Shakespeare’s question. “Names aren’t just convenient labels for people, places and things. They come with expectations,” the minister said. “Countries don’t normally have these pressures. But Great Britain? It’s quite a name to live up to.”The words are from the opening of Great Britain? How We Get Our Future Back,publishedlast year by the Labour MP Torsten Bell, now a Treasury minister. Bell’s book is about why this country is, and feels, broken. But it is also spot on about this country’s enduring naming problem. As Bell puts it: “What began as a statement about our geography has become one about our quality.”This may seem merely semantic. It is not. Great Britain may have been originally so described because of its relative size, not from any claim of superiority. But the name has slowly acquired some of these more pretentious associations. Particularly in recent times, governments have actively tried to promote the idea of distinctive British greatness. This deliberate freighting matters. It does this country, and the effort to rebuild trust in politics, few favours.On Monday, the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander,unveiled the logoand colourful livery of Great British Railways, the renationalised rail system that will soon replace the fragmented and privatised network that has existed since 1997. There are positives in the new structure, and even the new look. The name, though, is definitely not one of them.The name Great British Railways is puffed-up, misleading, tin-eared and backward-looking. It is puffed-up because, despite the purely geographical origin of the words Great Britain, the name sounds boastful for no reason. It is misleading because the railways are not great; tin-eared because the public is not so easily deceived; and backward-looking because it panders to a version of this country that no longer exists. Everyone knows it is a nonsense.But the rail rebranding is not alone. Keir Starmer’s government has a fondness for Great British namings. As well as Great British Railways, it is also bequeathing Great British Energy, the publicly owned clean energy company that was briefly Starmer’s flagship national infrastructure project back when Labour was in opposition. If other industries require public rescue, new candidates may follow. Great British Water, anyone?Institutions matter. They provide stability to a nation-state and, just as important, a sense of order. But that vital task cannot be wished into existence by a rebranding exercise. It is one reason why the right name is important. British Railways, as the rail system was known after nationalisation in 1948, was a good name at the time, because it was exactly what it said on the tin. The same was still true after it began calling itself British Rail in 1965.None of this should in any way imply that such institutions are so important they should never be reformed. Not a bit of it. One big reason why no government today would dare go back to using the otherwise-obvious name of British Railways is that the 1948 system became associated, unfairly or not, with a resistance to modernisation and efficiency. Calling it British Railways would suggest a naive reversion to an unlamented past.Yet the naming of Great British Railways is also silly for two serious reasons. The first is that it is a hollow Brexit-era conceit in what is now an increasingly post-Brexit era, with which it obviously jars. The second is that greatness and Britain have a particularly strong, although not universal, resonance in England, but are not echoed to the same degree in Britain’s devolved nations.In 2011 David Camerontried to rebrandBritish global soft power in terms of supposed “great” businesses, creativity, entrepreneurialism and assorted other “great” qualities. After the Brexit vote, this drive became more bombastic. Boris Johnson won the Conservative leadership with what he dubbed “a vision of Britain as the greatest place on Earth”. The “great” effort was then relaunched in time for the G7 and Cop26 meetings chaired by Johnson. Ever keen to jump on a bandwagon, the then-Tory transport secretary Grant Shapps promised a new public body in 2021 to replace Network Rail under the name Great British Railways.Labour has now adopted that same name for its own rail plans. The effort is misplaced. The public does not regard Brexit-era national triumphalism or ersatz Johnsonism as the key to restoring the railways or the energy supply industry. It wants things that work efficiently, are well-run and provide good value. To brand the renationalised rail system as “great” takes the public for fools. For a government that needs all the friends it can get, this is a mistake.But it is also a mistake because there is a missed opportunity. This government wants to show that the United Kingdom can still deliver for its nations and regions. It is right to try. But it would have a rather better chance of achieving it if, instead of pretending to restore lost British greatness as Johnson did, Labour instead saw such infrastructure and utilities issues within a framework of a strengthened UK that works with the devolved nations.Merely to rebrand major projects as Railways UK or Energy UK would not, of course, be sufficient. It would certainly not be enough to save Labour from its likely defeats by the nationalist parties in the May 2026 elections. But it would provide a much clearer institutional framework within which to try. It would give more intellectual and political coherence to the changes that are needed in so many places in the UK. Get it right, and the results might actually be great.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsRail transportOpinionTransportInfrastructurecommentShareReuse this content"

This is the question we must urgently reckon withMunira WilsonNo parent should worry about their child’s safety while they work. But a crisis in our early-years sector is shielding predators such as Vincent ChanThu 11 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 03.33 ESTShareIremember those initial heart-wrenching days and weeks leaving my daughter, aged nine months, at the nursery. She was distraught as I left, and I – like so many parents – headed off to work feeling guilty for leaving her, wondering if I was doing the right thing. Every parent does the research and nursery visits, reads the Ofsted reports and assumes that the staff in their chosen nursery will have the necessary qualifications and training to take care of their child. Obviously, there will be hiccups along the way, but never in your wildest nightmares do you think your child might be physically – or worse still, sexually – abused.Yet theharrowing case of Vincent Chan, a former nursery worker in Camden, north London, who pleaded guilty to nine counts of sexual assault and 17 counts of taking or making indecent photos of children, hit the headlines last week, leaving parents with young children across the country feeling physically sick and asking the question: How did this happen? Tragically, this is not an isolated case.In September,Roksana Leckawas sentenced to eight years in prison for 21 counts of child cruelty at Riverside Nursery in Twickenham Green and a nursery in Hounslow. Last year, Kate Roughley was jailed for manslaughter following neglect of baby Gigi Meehan at a nursery in Cheadle, Greater Manchester. The BBC’s Panorama investigation exposed a litany of cases of poor care and neglect in nurseries across the country.No parent should be left worrying about the safety of their child as they head off for a day’s work. No child should be subject to abuse that could have lifelong implications. And yet, too many children have experienced abuse at the hands of those we were told to trust. How have we got here?Expanding entitlement to“free” childcare provisionto more families has, in the words of somesector leaders,led to a “race to the bottom”. These places have been consistently underfunded by government, leaving childcare providers to fill the gaps. Some told me they’re now dealing with “crowd management” – as opposed to providing quality care. Minimum wage, long hours and an under-appreciation for the role have fuelled a recruitment and retention crisis that leaves good staff burnt out. With such a high turnover, providers are then hesitant to invest in staff who may leave after only a few months.The Department for Education’s ownreporton hiring incentives, published in October, noted that many candidates for early-years roles lacked relevant qualifications, provided no evidence of soft skills and demonstrated little interest in the role or a desire to work in early years. If many staff don’t care about the children they’re working with, how can we hope for them to identify concerning behaviours before it’s too late?CCTV footage was pivotalto securing convictions in both the Cheadle andTwickenham cases. In the Camden case, it is unclear whether CCTV footage was in use at the time of Chan’s offences, but if it had been, it would have been wiped by the time his offences came to light. Now is the time to mandate the use of CCTV in nurseries, with clear guidance that the footage should be regularly reviewed by management and form part of Ofsted inspections.Yes, of course, there are always privacy concerns, but no parent I have ever spoken to would put their baby’s privacy over their safety. Babies cannot communicate when harm is being done to them, so it is crucial we have regularly monitored CCTV to ensure neglect and abuse are not taking place. It could also provide a helpful tool for staff training.The Australian government isnow piloting CCTVin nurseries, alongside a register of early-years practitioners. A register would ensure staff qualifications, training and previous history are tracked. Shockingly, the Twickenham Green parents only discovered during the course of the trial that Lecka lacked relevant qualifications and that red flags had been raised in relation to her behaviour at a previous nursery in which she had worked.Ensuring that Ofsted has the powers and the resources to inspect nursery chain providers is another area that government needs to focus on. While the government has made somewelcome moveson this issue, including reducing the gap in inspections from six years to four years and requiring new settings to be inspected within 12 months of opening, it is yet to set out a timeframe for when these powers will come into effect. Furthermore, currently, if a setting deregisters and closes, Ofsted has no powers to investigate that setting and the staff who worked there any further.Every time one of these horrifying cases comes to light, we all say, “never again”. Every time a government minister speaks about these cases, they say children’s safety is of the utmost importance to government. The time for prevarication is over. Parents are demanding immediate action, and we need to work cross-party to secure change.Munira Wilson is Liberal Democrat MP for TwickenhamDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He is failing to introduce itThu 11 Dec 2025 13.31 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 16.22 ESTShareIn opposition, Sir Keir Starmer called the unelected House of Lords “indefensible”. This week, barely 18 months into his prime ministership, Sir Keir took the total of unelected peers he has appointed since July 2024 to 96. Remarkably, Wednesday’s 34new life peerages, mainly Labour supporters, take his appointment total above those of each of his four most recent Conservative predecessors. You must go back toDavid Cameronto find a prime minister who did more to stuff the Lords than Sir Keir.At the last election, Labour presented itself to the voters as a party of Lords reform. The party manifesto promised to remove the remaining hereditary peers, to reform the appointments process, to impose a peers’ retirement age, and to consult on proposals for replacing the Lords with an alternative second chamber. TheHouse of Lords, the manifesto flatly declared, was “too big”.In office, Labour’s record on Lords reform has been dismal. True,the billremoving the hereditaries is finally close to completing its parliamentary passage (it has taken nearly 16 monthsalready, and it is not yet over the finishing line). But there is nothing to show for the other manifesto pledges, which were not included in the current bill. Nor are we likely to see them any time soon. The Starmer government missed its best Lords reform moment last year. Today, authority diminished, there seems little appetite for more.Instead, Labour’s main preoccupation in the Lords is not reform but party advantage. Though Labour has its large Commons majority, there are currently 282 Conservativesin the Lords, compared with 209 Labour peers. The government has lostover 100 divisionsin the Lords since 2024, most recently on the employment rights billon Wednesday. Peers have also dug in against the private member’s bill on assisted dying. Labour leaders in the Lords want more Labour appointments, so they can ​p​ush such opposition back. That may sound reasonable, but it merely feeds an ermine ​arms race which has made both main parties enemies of reform for years.The result is that the upper house, which Labour once deemed too big, is getting even bigger. Sir Keir hasalready appointedmore new life peers than the 85 remaining hereditaries who will lose their places when the reform bill finally becomes law. The wish for a more even balance with the Tories means there will be more to come. After the Blair-era reforms,Lords membershipstood at 666. Today, the figure is 850, with this week’s new appointees waiting in the wings. With 650 MPs in the Commons, the UK parliament may soon have more than 1,500 members. This is a ludicrous, unnecessary and, to many, corrupt total. There is nothing like it in any other parliament.Yet unless and until Sir Keir gets a grip on the appointments system, these figures will only mount, feeding even greater public anger. In the absence of the root-and-branch reform that Labour once supported, the best way to reduce numbers in the Lords is the one proposed byMeg Russellof the UCL Constitution Unit and others: to cap membership at no higher than that of the Commons (and ideally lower). Labour could achieve this by adopting new rules and formulas that limit a prime minister’s scope to appoint. Such changes would be popular and rational. They ​also need making now, if only ​to prevent Nigel Farage from flooding the Lords with even larger numbers of new peers​ in a few years’ time.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Church of England is right to push backThu 11 Dec 2025 13.31 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 13.55 ESTShareThe story of Christmas is ataleof poverty and flight from persecution. According to Christian tradition, humanity’s saviour is born in a stable, since Mary and Joseph are unable to find a room in Bethlehem. The holy family subsequently flee to Egypt to escape the murderous intentions of King Herod. This drama grounds the New Testament message of compassion for the stranger, the fugitive and all those who find themselves far from home. “I was hungry and you gave me food to eat,”says Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew. “I was a stranger and you welcomed me.”The spirit of a far-right show of force planned on Saturday by Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, AKA Tommy Robinson, will be somewhat different. Sincereportedlyconverting fully to Christianity whileservinga prison sentence for contempt of court, Mr Yaxley-Lennon has energetically deployed his faith to promote his own gospel of ethnic discord and political polarisation. The Unite the Kingdom rally he organised in July featured hymns, a plethora of wooden crosses and a Christian preacher whospokeof a war against “the Muslim”. His latest provocation is a “carol service” in central London, ostensibly to “put Christ back in Christmas”.It would be easy to mock the absurdity of a seasonal event implicitly dedicated to the cause of undermining peace and goodwill. But the apparent rise of Christian nationalism in Britain needs to be taken seriously. Crusader-style rhetoric has long been afeatureof fringe extremist organisations. But Mr Yaxley-Lennon’s malign influence is popularising it to an extent hitherto unseen. In Reform UK, there are also signs that national populism in Britain is learning from the successful weaponisation of cultural Christianity elsewhere. Nigel Farage, though not a regular church attender, has begun totalk uphis affinity with conservative Anglicanism. The theologian James Orr, an influential figure in Maga circles and a friend of JD Vance, has beenrecruitedas a senior Reform UK adviser.An ethnocentric politics legitimising xenophobia, cultural exclusivism and indiscriminate deportations is fundamentally unchristian, as the late Pope Francis repeatedlyunderlined. The Church of England has now launched its own campaign against the far-right misappropriation of Christian imagery and the gospel message. The Rev Arun Arora, the bishop of Kirkstall and the co-lead bishop on racial justice for the church, pithily observed that Mr Yaxley-Lennon’s conversion does not accord him “the right to subvert the faith so that it serves his purpose rather than the other way around”.In its various guises, the contemporary far right is seeking to transformChristianityinto a vehicle for cultural and ethnic supremacism, exploiting and corrupting desires for meaning and belonging. In Donald Trump’s America and Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, this project has furnished a spurious religious underpinning to a politics of authoritarian power and exclusion.Nothing could be further from the spirit of St Paul when heasserts: “There is neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither slave nor free; nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” The modern notion of universal human rights owes a debt to this revolutionary assertion made 2,000 years ago. Mr Yaxley-Lennon maintains that his confrontational carol service can be a moment to “reclaim and celebrate our heritage, culture and Christian identity”. There is a crucial opposition, though, between glorifying nativism and reflecting on the meaning of the nativity.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I, however, respect the UK National Screening Committee’srecommendationnot to screen most men using the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test.The job of the committee was to weigh up the benefits and harms of any available test for routine screening. PSA testing, as a first step to diagnose cancer, results in false negatives and a significant number of false positives, meaning it has both low sensitivity and low specificity, making it a poor screening marker. PSA screening has been conducted in the US; there are varying estimates that, over three decades, it has resulted inmore than 1 million patientsreceiving treatment (eg surgery or radiotherapy) they did not need.Randomised trials are considered the gold standard in modern medicine. Approximations from theEuropean Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancerestimate that PSA-based screening prevents about 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer per 1,000 men screened over 13 years. This illustrates the problem of overdiagnosis of low-volume, low-risk cancers that would not cause patients harm. In addition to a huge psychological burden for patients, any treatment may be unnecessary and result in possible lifelong side-effects (such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction).As difficult as it may seem, we should not settle for PSA tests for routine screening. We must redouble efforts to identify screening markers with high sensitivity and high specificity, and accelerate research into treatment for this terrible disease.Aamir AhmedLondonI deeply sympathise with your letter writer Pat Sharpe regarding the loss of her husband. However, as a retired consultant physician, I have always refused PSA testing. There is a naive belief that early detection and treatment improves outcomes. For most cancers this is true, but sadly not so for prostate cancer. The best study I know of (Hamdy et al, New England Journal of Medicine, 2023) clearly shows that outcomes in terms of mortality are essentially identical whether patients are assigned to radical surgery, radiotherapy or simple observation. Few patients die in any group, and active treatment doesn’t influence this.However, radical treatment has frequent and horrible side-effects. Screening is only worthwhile if there is effective treatment. This isn’t so for prostate cancer.Dr Graham SimpsonMelbourne, AustraliaPat Sharpe’s letter resonates forcefully with my wife and me. I had always understood PSA testing to be little more than worthless. However, a year ago, I had to undergo routine blood tests and decided to ask the nurse to include a PSA test because of an interview I had heard on the radio that morning. I was 62, with no symptoms or reason to test.I am so glad that I asked. I had an elevated PSA (6.4) and was swiftly diagnosed with high-risk, high-volume prostate cancer; fortunately it was still contained.I have had a prostatectomy, which brings its own consequences, but my wife and I can live with those. Had I continued in my ignorance, I wonder just how many more Christmases I would have enjoyed.Adrian BellGosport, HampshireI first showed a (slightly) elevated PSA level some 20 years ago in the course of an annual check-up. The consultant to whom I was referred explained that I could have a biopsy but that it carried a risk of erectile dysfunction and/or impotence. So, valuing my continence and sexual life, I declined. This set a pattern over the ensuing years of a gradually but consistently rising PSA. Eventually I had a multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) and a number of other non-invasive tests, and I was advised that the likelihood of my having cancer was very low.As I understand it, mpMRI is a far more accurate predictor than PSA. Why is it not used in routine screening? Men who, like me, do not want to undergo the painful and potentially damaging biopsy, might be much more likely to have the painless and safe mpMRI scan.David GollanczLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Those who support its existence in its current or similar form justify it on the grounds that it performs a useful revising function which can improve the detail of legislation, and it undoubtedly does good work.Senior opponents of assisted dying bill urge Lords not to deliberately block itRead moreBut the fact that it is unelected can only be tolerated in a democracy provided its members accept that it is for the House of Commons to have the last word on what becomes law and what doesn’t in this country.If the Lords resort to blocking procedures, and impede the implementation of decisions taken in the Commons, this is effectively breaking this convention. So how long should we, as the democratically elected chamber, put up with it?Matters seem to be coming to a head with a private member’s bill currently in the House of Lords. The proposed law in question is the assisted dying bill, which was the subject of lengthy and often lively debate in the Commons. We, as democratically elected MPs, each made up our own mind on the bill because it’s a “conscience issue”, not party policy.We didn’t support it, but respect the fact that it passed through the Commons with a convincing majority. The question now is: is it acceptable for the Lords simply to keep talking in an attempt to reach the end of the parliamentary session without ever getting to a vote? The answer to that must be no.What is happening to the assisted dying bill in the House of Lords?Read moreOr, if they do get to a vote, and they reject the will of the Commons, what should happen next? The expectation is clearly that, within a reasonable timeframe, the decision of the democratically elected chamber should take precedence.Any attempt to derail that process not only breaks convention, it also risks setting a precedent that would undoubtedly increase the calls for a radical reform of the House of Lords sooner rather than later.We would respectfully suggest that members of the Lords who may be contemplating going down that route should think very carefully about the consequences of their actions.Nia Griffith MPJustin Madders MPDebbie Abrahams MPHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I live by the River Kennet and I caught one on my garden trail camera in August, along with otters in the same 30-second clip. The identification of the beaver is unmistakable, and was confirmed by the Berks, Bucks and Oxon wildlife trust. Two weeks ago, my neighbour caught a beaver on her garden trail camera. Her garden is 50 yards downstream of ours.Two independent beaver sightings three months apart suggest that the beaver or beavers are resident. I have heard anecdotally of beaver gnawings in the area, but I cannot confirm that. There are beavers in captivity at Ewhurst Park 10 miles away, but inquiries with them have confirmed that they have not had any escapees.Perhaps wild beavers are more widespread than anyone, including the Beaver Trust, realises.Richard FosterThatcham, BerkshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It’s 3pm on a Thursday, you think, they’ve probably just been reffing a local game. Then, you think, there isn’t a football pitch around here. And why haven’t they changed and showered? Then more referees walk in, more linesmen, one of them in a comedy wig. And eventually the penny drops.Yes, “the Darts” is back: an indispensable festive trimming that – much like Christmas itself – always seems to roll around a little sooner every year. Fire up all the old cliches: “the beauty of set play”, “bent the wire”, “pressure the shot”. Wheel John Part out of the attic. Fingers poised on the 180 zoom. You know it’s serious, because it’s two hours before his match andLuke Littleris already on the practice board.Littler won on opening night, of course he did. Nobody will be too fussed about dwelling on the finer details of his 3-0 win over Darius Labanauskas, least of all Littler himself. But the Lithuanian can certainly be proud of the way he pushedthe defending champion, averaging 95 and taking the first two sets to deciding legs.Certainly there was little here to disabuse anyone of the notion that Littler is the overwhelming favourite to claim the sport’s first ever £1m prize. It took 23 years for Phil Taylor – a 16-time winner – to accumulate that sum in world championship prize money. This year’s winner could do it in the space of a few weeks. Even Labanauskas walked away with £15,000 for his first-round defeat.And in a way there has always been a kind of paradox at the heart of this championship: an event that somehow keeps getting bigger while also managing to stay exactly the same. This is the first year in which the field has expanded from 96 players to 128. Next year’s tournament will move from the West Hall to the larger Great Hall in an attempt to meet the voracious demand that led to all the tickets selling out in 12 minutes in July.View image in fullscreenFans in fancy dress enjoy the darts; tickets for this year’s tournament sold out in 12 minutes.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBy any barometer the sums of money at stake here are genuinely life-changing, sums that have gently warped the gravity of the sport. The prize money on the lower rungs of the tour – the weekly tournaments in regional leisure centres where most pros spend most of their existence – is handy, but still not quite enough to make a viable living.By contrast, a single run at Alexandra Palace can make or break an entire year, an entire career. Take the delighted Arno Merk, an amateur from Germany who has barely played on television before, whose first-night win over Kim Huybrechts netted him a cheque of at least £25,000. “It’s a hefty sum of money,” he said. “I’m definitely going to use it as a springboard and go full-throttle to become a professional. I’m not going to buy a car or anything.”‘It can be brutal’: Gian van Veen learns to fly with the stars after dartitisRead moreAnd so in a sport still defined by fine margins, these few weeks take on a more feverish, desperate hue than ever before. The highs can be supreme; the lows crushing. In the first week of 2023 Michael Smith sat atop the world, having tasted perfection in the greatest leg of darts ever seen. Two years later he lost his first match, at which point all the 2023 money also dropped off his ranking, instantly dumping him out of the top 16.Now, after a nightmarish few years in which his body has fallen apart and his ranking has collapsed, Smith is back. He comfortably saw off Lisa Ashton, the women’s world matchplay champion, 3-0 on opening night, offering hope of a happy coda to a year blighted by ankle injuries, shoulder injuries and chronic arthritis in a wrist that left him barely able to practise for more than half an hour. “The butterflies was bad this morning,” Smith admitted. “It’s hard coming the first night, especially if you get beat.”View image in fullscreenFans in chicken costumes are searched by security on their way in to Alexandra Palace.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianMichael van Gerwen is just one of the many pros who have been grumbling at the potential for outsized world championship prize money to distort the sport. “I don’t think the distribution is fair,” he said recently. “The world champion soon hardly needs to play any other tournament.” All of which raises an interesting counter-question: in a 12-month sport, has this show now becometoobig?One to chew on for the darts hardcore and the tour stalwarts. But for all the strides this sport has made over the decades, this remains its one genuine showpiece, its one cut-through event, and to an extent its rewards are simply a reflection of its status. And from the happy costumed throngs making their annual pilgrimage up the hill, you will hear few complaints.After all, if darts has taught us anything, it’s the value of giving people exactly what they want.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipsDartsLuke LittlernewsShareReuse this content"

This represented a 14th victory in their past 16 matches and it felt a significant one, too, given the pileup at the top of the table amid the scrap to advance automatically to the last 16 in March.Europa League roundup: Forest win late at Utrecht, Rangers lose to FerencvarosRead moreThen came an ominous message from Emery. “We can’t stop,” he said. “TheEuropa Leagueis very important for us – to be favourites, it depends if we are playing consistently, getting in the top eight. There are other teams progressively getting better. This competition is very difficult. But of course we are motivated, focused and we want to enjoy each moment, share emotions with our supporters. “That is what playing in Europe is all about. We have had those exciting moments in the Conference League, Champions League and now the Europa League. Three points today gives us confidence for the process.” Villa are third on 15 points after a fifth win from six matches, but only five points separate Lyon, who are top, and Red Star Belgrade in 17th.On the eve of this fixture, Xherdan Shaqiri, who returned last year to the club he first joined aged eight, insistedBaselcan beat anyone here. Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester United have all departed this stadium empty-handed across the past 15 years and on touchdown in Basel, Emery was quick to acknowledge that the Swiss side’s recent form also commanded respect.Basel had won their previous seven home matches in this competition, including two this season. Villa, of course, know all about the power of home form having lost just twice at Villa Park since August 2024; it has fuelled their surge up the Premier League and they return to domestic duty at West Ham on Sunday.View image in fullscreenEvann Guessand did well to control a miscued clearance and fire the ball past the Basel goalkeeper to put Aston Villa in front in the 12th minute.Photograph: Pierre Albouy/ReutersEmery, determined to add a fifth Europa League win to his CV, knows there is a balance to strike between this competition and the league, which remains the priority. Villa made eight changes from their stoppage-time victory over Arsenal, with Matty Cash, Ezri Konsa and Amadou Onana the trio to retain their starting berths. Emiliano Martínez and Pau Torres, who was forced off through injury last weekend, were absent altogether. Martínez was again missing with a back problem, which forced him to pull out of the starting lineup at Brighton last week. “It is not a big problem,” Emery said.Rotation equals opportunity and Guessand seized his chance on 12 minutes in scruffy circumstances. Marwin Hitz, the Basel goalkeeper, punched a Villa corner clear but Shaqiri’s clearance cannoned off the calf of an unknowing Philip Otele and Guessand, on the slide, showed awareness to locate the bottom corner to score his second Villa goal, both coming in this competition.Basel thought they had equalised courtesy of a crisp Léo Leroy finish approaching the half hour, but Dominik Schmid was ruled offside in the buildup following a review by the video assistant referee. Federer had to sympathise with a close call, commonplace in his previous life. Six minutes later, Shaqiri floated a free-kick into the box and Flavius Daniliuc gambled. So did Marco Bizot, the Villa goalkeeper deputising for Martínez, rushing from his goal towards the penalty spot, where Daniliuc flicked the ball into the net. Emery winced on the touchline. Basel’s Muttenzerkurve, home to their ultras, turned up the volume.View image in fullscreenFlavius Daniliuc enjoys his goal against Aston Villa that levelled up the game for Basel at 1-1.Photograph: James Marsh/ShutterstockVilla underwhelmed in the first half and Emery recognised as much, introducing one of his most trusted players in Tielemans at the break. He replaced Cash and Lamare Bogarde shifted to right-back. Emery has masterminded Villa’s turnaround from relegation strugglers to European regulars and perhaps he also has psychic powers. At this point, Villa supporters probably believe he is capable of anything.Just as it seemed Villa were huffing and puffing, Bogarde threaded a pass into Emiliano Buendía, who cleverly held off his marker and rolled a pass into the path of an advancing Tielemans on the edge of the box. On the move, the Belgian connected beautifully, coolly side-footing a shot low into the bottom corner before hurtling towards the pocket of Villa fans to celebrate. “Of course when we are winning, every plan more or less makes sense,” Emery said.Villa should have extended their advantage five minutes later when Jadon Sancho squared for Guessand on the edge of the six-yard box but the winger blazed over. Emery called for the cavalry soon afterwards, Boubacar Kamara, Morgan Rogers and Ollie Watkins entering from the bench midway through the second half. But ultimately Villa did not have to overexert themselves.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueBaselAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Nonetheless, these are worrying times for Wilfried Nancy andCeltic. Seriously worrying, in truth.Back-to-back losses since the Frenchman’s arrival would be bad enough without the rampant manner in which Roma ensured six points from six in visits to Glasgow during this season’sEuropa League. What a canter this proved from minute one.Celtic are a club with aspirations of being a serious force in Europe and so recently were.Roma, inspired by Evan Ferguson’s first half double, faced disjointed and dysfunctional opposition. Sunday’s League Cup final against St Mirren carries huge meaning for Nancy. He has to prove, primarily, that he can field a team that will play to their strengths. Nancy is operating in the most unforgiving of environments, where patience was thin long before his arrival.Classy Tielemans seals win in Basel to keep Aston Villa on march in EuropeRead moreRoma’s first visit to Celtic Park came a matter of weeks after they toyed with Rangers at Ibrox. Celtic knew they would face high level opposition. Indeed, a key challenge in this Roma season may soon be whether to prioritise a tilt at the Serie A title or try to combine the same with a proper attempt at claiming silverware in Europe. Gian Piero Gasperini has unsurprisingly fuelled hopes of glory.Celtic’s aspirations are lower nowadays. A crucial transfer window awaits, in which Nancy must try to rejuvenate a stale and imbalanced squad. Celtic should still be the favourites to prevail in Scotland but Sunday’s home loss against Hearts, Nancy’s first game in office, signalled the scale of the Frenchman’s task.Nancy is determined to do it his way. He stuck with the players and adjusted formation that toiled days earlier. Three centre-backs, all left-footed, were again deployed. If you were to be kind, you would suggest the midfield is fluid. Roma sensed vulnerability, with the visitors completely dominating the early exchanges. They were heavily assisted for the opening goal, when not needing it, by Celtic.View image in fullscreenWilfried Nancy cut a frustrated figure on the touchline in Celtic’s loss.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAKasper Schmeichel had cheaply given possession straight to Roma, triggering the attack which led to a corner. Matías Soulé whipped it in, with Liam Scales’s panic as Gianluca Mancini lurked meaning the centre-back headed the ball straight into his own net. Albeit comedic in arrival, the goal only emphasised the extent to which Roma had Celtic pinned inside their own territory.Reo Hatate was next to hand Roma a favour, the midfielder having his pocket easily picked 25 yards from Celtic’s goal. Ferguson should have doubled the Roma lead but cracked his shot against the outside of a post. As Schmeichel saved from the wonderful Soulé, Celtic were clinging on. Roma soon claimed the second, their dominance deserved. It arrived in blissfully simple circumstances, Soulé releasing Mehmet Zeki Celik on the right wing. Celik’s cross left Ferguson with little more than a tap in.Hatate scooped over as Celtic mounted something approaching a response but this was galling for anybody of green and white persuasion. Apathy rather than anger set in as Ferguson notched a Roma third. Soulé was the creator, finding the feet of the Irishman before Ferguson spun and battered the ball low beyond Schmeichel.An iota of salvation should have arrived for Celtic in the same spell of stoppage time but Arne Engels struck the post with his penalty after being fouled by Mario Hermoso. Nancy later admitted his players were “too soft” in the first half.Unable to make 11 changes at the break, Nancy opted for three. One of the replacements, Kelechi Iheanacho, should have reduced the arrears in the 53rd minute but shot wide when clean through on goal. Albeit Roma looked content with their lot, Iheanacho’s chance arrived in a period where Celtic at least played with structure.The former Leicester City man was more ruthless with his next opportunity. Iheanacho converted a low cross from Engels. The trouble for Celtic? The goal was chalked off for offside. It had long since been that kind of night for the Scottish champions.The Roma substitute Leon Bailey was denied a goal by an identical, belated intervention from officialdom. Thousands of punters did not bother to hang around for the VAR check, such was the state of affairs regardless. Nancy must have taken note. He is a coach in need of a sharp upturn in fortune.Asked afterwards if he had expected such a difficult start, Nancy replied: “I expected it. Come on guys, I just came one week ago. A few players played six games in a row, we have injured players, we have big games coming. So I expected that.”“I want to be positive, we have situations I can be positive about but tonight was difficult,” he added. “In the first half, we were too soft in certain moments. We have to be stronger. We didn’t cope with the intensity in the first half. The second half was better. When we raised the pressure we were able to connect better. We need to be closer to be able to connect and get forward quicker.”Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueCelticRomamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The prices drew a furious reaction from FSE, which said the minimum the most dedicated fans can expect to pay to watch their team from the first match to the final would be $6,900 (£5,137.74) – five times more than it would have cost to do so when the World Cup was held in Qatar in 2022. That figure could more than double once costs such as flights and accommodation are factored into attending a tournament held in Canada, Mexico and the US.FSE said: “Football ­Supporters Europe is astonished by the ­extortionate ticket prices imposed byFifaon the most dedicated ­supporters for next year’s Fifa World Cup. This is a monumental betrayal of the ­tradition of the World Cup, ­ignoring the contribution of ­supporters to the spectacle it is.“We call on Fifa to immediately halt PMA ticket sales, engage in a consultation with all impacted parties, and review ticket prices and category ­distribution until a solution that respects the tradition, universality, and cultural significance of the World Cup is found.”Members of England ­Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) were also ­astonished to hear of the prices from the Football Association on Thursday. The cheapest tickets for England’s opening match, against Croatia in Dallas, will cost $265 (£195) and are priced at a minimum of $220 (£165) when Thomas Tuchel’s side face Ghana in Boston and Panama in New Jersey in their other Group L games.View image in fullscreenEngland fans could buy tickets for the final of Euro 2024 for as little as €95.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianESTC members discovered that a semi-final ticket would set them back a minimum of £687, up from £508 to attend the quarter-finals, and £220 and £175, respectively, to go to the last-16 and last-32 ties. Those prices will force loyal fans to decide whether it is worth attending the tournament. By comparison, following England from the first match of Euro 2024 to the final with tickets in the “fans first” category would have cost €375 (£328) according to information published by Uefa in the autumn of 2023.Even tickets in the next category up would have cost a total of €860 (£753). Fans also discovered earlier this week that tourists to the US face­having to reveal their social media activityfrom the last five years, under new plans from President Donald Trump’s administration.FSE’s outrage was shared by the England supporters group Free Lions, which said on X: “This can’t be allowed to happen. Match-goers across the world deserve protection from these rip-off prices.”Thursday featured the opening of a random lottery for tickets opened by Fifa for the first time since the draw for the tournament was held last week. All fans, not just those able to purchase tickets through the PMA allocation, will be able to go online between now and 13 January and try to order as many tickets as they would like at fixed prices. Tickets sold in earlier windows have been subject to dynamic pricing, meaning they will rise or fall depending on demand.PMA allocations will equate to 8% of a stadium’s capacity for each match. FSE said that rather than adopting a standard price across all group matches, pricing appeared to have been calculated “dependent on vague criteria such as the perceived attractiveness of the fixture”.Fifa has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026FifaFootball ticket pricesWorld CupFootball politicsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Having arrived in Dublin missing some of their big-hitters including star striker Jean-Philippe Mateta and the marauding wing-back Daniel Muñoz, they left with a comfortable victory that virtually assured them of a place in theConference Leagueplayoffs.Oliver Glasner has already said that he will play a weakened team against Finnish side KuPS in their final group stage match next week despite slipping up against Strasbourg on their last outing as Palace are in the middle of a marathon December in which they will play eight times. So it was heartening for him to see some of his fringe players shine, as Christantus Uche capped only his second start since joining on an initial loan from Getafe in the summer with a well-taken goal and Eddie Nketiah scored for the second game in succession.Europa League roundup: Forest win late at Utrecht, Rangers lose to FerencvarosRead moreAShelbourneside that finished their domestic season last month were no match even for a largely second-string Palace, who had only 15 senior outfield players available with Mateta and Muñoz sidelined by knee injuries. Uche ended the evening being serenaded by the visiting support but Glasner is hoping there is plenty more to come from the Nigerian.“One swallow doesn’t make a summer. So it was one swallow and it’s nice to see, but a few more I have to follow, then it will be summer,” he said.Quick GuideConference League: Aberdeen hopes ended by StrasbourgShowMartial Godo’s first-half strike was enough to earn Strasbourg a 1-0 win at Aberdeen in the  Conference League, ending the Scottish Premiership side's hopes of a playoff place.Dimitar Mitov made several excellent saves – including one from the penalty spot – to keep the home side in the game but they ultimately slipped to defeat. Godo got the winner against the run of play in the 35th minute, taking a touch from Sam Amo-Ameyaw's defence-splitting pass before finding the bottom corner.Aberdeen made a fast start, with Stuart Armstrong heavily involved. The former Scotland man intercepted a loose ball after 10 minutes and fed Marko Lazetic who saw his effort blocked. The hosts had the ball in the net after 14 minutes, Mats Knoester heading in an Armstrong corner at the far post – but a VAR check confirmed a handball.Strasbourg's former Chelsea defender Ben Chilwell was denied by Mitov, before Adil Aouchiche pounced on further hesitation in the visiting defence to let rip from the edge of the area, hitting narrowly over. Aberdeen had the better of the first half but went in behind after Godo's sucker-punch of a strike.Mitov flew across his goal early in the second half to deny Godo from a Guela Doué cross, then stuck out a paw to turn Godo’s deflected effort over the bar. Strasbourg had a great chance to double their lead from the penalty spot after 71 minutes, but Ismaël Doukouré saw his spot-kick saved by Mitov.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Thankfully there was no repeat of the unsavoury scenes in France when a minority of Palace fans werefighting among themselves before kick-off, although there was a banner behind the goal that read “Kick racists out of Palace”. Heavy rain in the Irish capital greeted the 1,800 who had made the trip, with the game being held at Shamrock Rovers’ Tallaght Stadium because Shelbourne’s Tolka Park ground does not meet Uefa requirements.This is the first time Shelbourne have reached the league stage of a European competition but they had managed only one point and no goals from their first four matches. Manager Joey O’Brien – the former Bolton and West Ham defender who took over from Damien Duff in July – had urged his players to embrace the occasion in front of a sold-out crowd that included his former Republic of Ireland teammate.It didn’t take long for Palace to establish their dominance despite the slippery surface. A flowing move in the 11th minute that was sparked by Daichi Kamada’s clever pass allowed Nketiah to lay the ball on a plate for Uche, who made no mistake with an excellent finish into the far corner. The lively Nketiah thought that he should have had a penalty when he raced into the area after being gifted possession but the Slovenian referee waved away his protests.View image in fullscreenYeremy Pino after scoring Palace’s third goal.Photograph: Sebastian Frej/Getty ImagesIt wasn’t long before his name was on the scoresheet as the former Arsenal striker tapped home from a yard out after Uche, who had been played in by Yeremy Pino, had struck the post. Poor Shelbourne were hanging on for dear life. Kameron Ledwidge was lucky to escape a booking for two agricultural changes on Pino before Chris Richards struck the crossbar from a corner.The game was in effect over as a contest eight minutes from half-time when Pino meandered past some comically weak challenges into the area and dispatched a shot past Wessel Speel, the on-loan Dutch goalkeeper.The Spaniard, Kamada and Adam Wharton were withdrawn for the second half as Glasner took the opportunity to give them a rest, with Will Hughes, Jefferson Lerma and Romain Esse replacing them. The latter almost scored with his first touch as Palace were quickly back into their groove but saw his shot blocked.Esse, who has been used sparingly by Glasner since he joined form Millwall last year and looked like he had a point to prove, was desperately unlucky to see one effort strike both posts before being gratefully clasped by Speel on the goalline. Uche should have at least hit the target seconds later but a glaring miss showed he is still far from the finished article.There were concerned looks on the Palace bench when Justin Devenny limped off late on as the 17-year-old striker Benji Casey was handed his debut on an otherwise perfect night for Glasner.Explore more on these topicsConference LeagueShelbourneCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Across those fixtures, almost 48,000 bought tickets but stayed away.WSL talking points: Chelsea’s historic run ended to give City breathing spaceRead moreThere has been criticism of the empty seats, at Wembley in particular, especially after games announced as sell-outs. Why does this gap exist? Is the criticism fair? What does the Football Association need to do to start ensuring ticket holders turn up?England are, in many respects, victims of their own success. A high bar has been set by attendances since the 2022 Euros. Across the world, the attendances for women’s football in England – at both domestic and international fixtures – are envied. The second-tier WSL2 had one of Europe’s highest cumulative attendances last season.The US women’s national team achieved a peak attendance of 32,303 in 2025, for a friendly against Brazil at the 70,240-capacity SoFi stadium in Los Angeles. That was the only crowd at their 15 home matches to break 30,000 and only three others attracted more than 20,000 spectators.England had a cumulative attendance in 2025 of 302,238 across eight home games, with an average attendance of 37,780 and the final two games brought a combined attendance of more than 94,000 in four days.England have benefited from increased interest in the team in a Euros year but in 2024, with no major tournament, they had an average attendance of 42,770 from seven home games with a peak audience of 78,346 for afriendly against the USat Wembley.TheUS won Olympic gold in Paristhat year but across 15 games on US soil their average attendance was 19,269. The lowest attendance was 3,242 against the Dominican Republic in the Concacaf Gold Cup and the highest of 50,644 was achieved in a SheBelieves Cup game against Japan.View image in fullscreenRecent USWNT games have attracted lower than usual crowds in recent months.Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty ImagesAttendances in England are not to be dismissed, with work done unceasingly to grow interest sincethe huge surgefollowing the 2022 home Euros win. The gap between tickets sold and bums on seats is a problem, but a relatively small one in this context.On 29 November, the gap was the starkest all year, with 74,611 in a sold-out Wembley for England’s friendly against China. Accounting for tickets held for broadcast and operational reasons, a sell-out crowd is approximately 85,000.When you can see large blocks of red seats at a sold-out Wembley, it can be frustrating but for a friendly against a team ranked 16th in the world, the attendance was far beyond what many would have imagined even a year ago, with the national stadium usually reserved for higher-profile games against opponents such as the US, France, Spain and Germany.Had the FA not announced a sellout, which it has to do for operational purposes, there would probably have been little attention paid to those empty seats, but announcing ticket sale progress serves a purpose. As a game edges closer to being sold out it makes fans feel they don’t want to miss out, and if it is a sellout it makes them feel their ticket is valuable.Gaps between tickets sold and attendances are not exclusive to women’s football. For example, the men’s game between England and Wales in October was announced as a sellout but had a 78,116 attendance.There are many potential reasons behind the gap for England women games. Tickets go on sale months in advance to reach high turnouts, often capitalising on major tournaments and fans being on a high after other big fixtures. April’s Nations League fixture against Spain is on sale, with the FA hoping to exploit the festive period by enabling people to buy tickets as gifts. There is no perfect formula and the cost of sales opening months in advance is dropouts. The earlier tickets go on sale the more opportunities there are for people’s plans to change or for Premier League and men’s FA Cup fixtures to move and have an impact.View image in fullscreenEngland and Spain will meet again in April and tickets for that match are on sale with the Christmas market in mind.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/EPAThe low price of tickets also plays a part. A family of four could watch England against China for £40 at the lowest price point. However, if the weather isn’t great, there are transport issues, men’s games change and clash or something else comes up, some may feel they can afford to let their low-priced tickets go to waste.Affordability matters though. The cost of living crisis is an important consideration and surely some drop-off is a price worth paying for that level of accessibility to top football?An official resale platform could help address these issues but that would not close the gap fully. In each area the FA is searching for a sweet spot, but these are constantly changing as the game grows and audience tastes and expectations develop.The Guardian understands a cross-functional group in the FA is across this decision-making process, made up of people from the commercial, marketing, communications, digital, ticketing, events, finance and broadcast teams, with technical and team operations staff also involved. The governing body’s relationship with the Football Supporters’ Association is considered a key part of engaging with and understanding the audience for the women’s games.There is very far from a simple fix and it is not an issue being ignored. That the numbers through the gates are at the level they are, though, shows a lot is being done right.Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

Leo Cullen, head coach of the Dublin-based province, spent a couple of seasons at Welford Road in the mid-2000s,winning the Premiership in 2006-07andlosing a Heineken Cup final against Waspsin the same season.Since 2022 the former second‑row has overseen four Champions Cup victories against his former club, including two in 2023-24. Three and a half years ago, there was amasterful quarter-final dismantlingof what was then Steve Borthwick’s side. Leinster will now shoot for a hat-trick of Welford Road victories this decade, and the presence of the New Zealand international Rieko Ioane, on full debut, is sure to help.Sports Personality of the Year 2025: Lionesses square off on six-strong shortlistRead moreThe respect between the clubs was illustrated by Cullen in his pre‑match media briefing: he opened by appealing for support for Lewis Moody after his former teammatewas diagnosed recently with motor neurone disease. Then he explained how his stay at Leicester had been formative.“It was based on hard work,” he said. “There’s no secret to success, is there? Preparation and hard work play a huge part. That’s the bit that will always be with me. It was tough going but I loved my time there. Cockers [Richard Cockerill] was starting off on his [coaching] journey. He was a hard taskmaster and he had attention to detail. There was great camaraderie, people coming together, an expectation with who you were representing. People used to queue outside, before the gates opened, to get their spot on the terrace.”Since Leinster first won Europe’s top club competition under Michael Cheika –defeating none other than Leicester at Murrayfield in 2008-09– expectation in Dublin has risen. They have won four titles but been runners-up four times, including a hat-trick of consecutive final defeats in 2022, 2023 and 2024. There is a growing feeling that another title is overdue, and pressure is something Cullen learned about at Leicester.“There’s an expectation there, a positive expectation, a positive pressure,“ he says. “I loved it, couldn’t speak highly enough of it. Did it shape me? Yeah, it shaped me in many different ways.”View image in fullscreenRieko Ioane made a big impact for Leinster against Harlequins and will make his full debut against Leicester.Photograph: Ryan Byrne/INPHO/ShutterstockOn Friday Cullen will go up against Geoff Parling, another Tigers playing alumnus, who joinedLeicesteras head coach during the summer after five years as Australia’s forwards coach. Cullen revealed that Parling visited Dublin last November, in his role with the Wallabies, to learn about Leinster’s coaching methods.“He came in for a day and lo and behold, now look where he is – coaching against us,” Cullen said, laughing. “There’s always a bit of a risk they [visiting coaches] might find a bit too much information. We’ll know more at 10 o’clock on Friday night.”Cullen added that Leicester’s game under Parling is based on “strong fundamentals … set piece, lineout, maul”. “They will kick a lot from No 9,” Cullen said. “Very strong aerial game. Both wingers, they’re quick fellas, and there’splenty of commentary about thatat the moment. We expect an aerial bombardment.”Ioane, who has scored 38 tries in 88 All Blacks appearances, made his debut off the bench in the openingChampions Cupwin against Harlequins last Saturday. He lines up at outside-centre alongside Robbie Henshaw at No 12. Tadhg Furlong and Rónan Kelleher return among seven changes made by Cullen, with Dan Sheehan’s presence on the bench demonstrating the squad’s depth and power. Joe McCarthy and James Ryan, winning his 99th cap for the province and back from suspension, pair up in the second row supported by a world-class back row of Jack Conan, Josh van der Flier and Caelan Doris.Leicester are without the injured Ollie Chessum, as well as Emeka Ilione and Jack van Poortvliet, but are able to welcome back five Test players: England’s Freddie Steward, Joe Heyes and Jamie Blamire return alongside Tommy Reffell and Nicky Smith of Wales. Reffell, whose partner, Annabel, gave birth to a daughter, Nancy, this week, is captain. George Martin, whose impending departure to Saracens was announced this week, remains out with a shoulder injury.The injured Chessum revealed he will soon need to find new motivation when facing theLeinsterplayers he befriended on the British & Irish Lions tour to Australia. “I’d not come across a lot of the Irish boys before, and I got on very well with them,” Chessum said. “It was quite easy to motivate yourself by creating a narrative around what they’re like as people. Now I’ve met them, I know that’s not always the case.”The Leinster contingent may wonder about the qualification of “always”, but strong new friendships have clearly formed among players on each side. This will be just another chapter in a historic, and largely friendly, rivalry.Explore more on these topicsChampions CupLeicesterLeinsterRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For much of her life, since her dramatic arrival in the pre-dawn hours of a May morning, the seven-month-old Miller has been a regular presence at England netball camps.Sometimes she sleeps courtside, other times watches from a balcony, or is passed between arms of players and staff members eagerly seeking a cuddle during team meetings. Whatever it takes for her mother, the England netball captain, Nat Metcalf, to get back on court.Aryna Sabalenka says ‘not fair on women to face basically biological men’ in tennisRead moreWhen Metcalf pulls on her England dress against Jamaica on Saturday, returning to competitionfor the first time since giving birth, Miller will be there, just as she always is. “The thought of playing for England with Miller around just feels …” starts Metcalf, before pausing, eyes filling with emotion. “Sorry, I nearly cried then.”It means a lot. Showing that “mummy can still do it and chase her dreams” is something of which Metcalf is immensely proud. Receiving her first centre pass at London’s Copper Box Arena will be an unforgettable moment.Metcalf, a Commonwealth champion and World Cup finalist, turned 33 on Tuesday. Having witnessed various friends’ fertility struggles, she and her husband, Josh, decided to let fate run its course with their own efforts to start a family. If and when it happened, they would navigate the delicate matter of her international sports career at that point. One thing was certain: “Retirement didn’t come into my mind.”She found out she was pregnant when with the England squad in Australia in September last year, preparing for a three-match series against the world No 1 side. It had, she says, “happened quicker than we anticipated”, prompting the need for some delicate messages to be delivered. She chose to be honest when telling her teammates the news, before flying home early, with EnglandNetballcryptically suggesting her departure was due to an “ongoing medical matter”. A recent battle with glandular fever provided the ideal cover until she was ready to go public after the first trimester.At that stage Metcalf was continuing on-court running, weight training and bike work, before steadily allowing the intensity to tail off into swimming and leisurely dog walks as the pregnancy continued. Off court, she busied herself with coaching and mentoring across amateur and elite ends of the game.View image in fullscreenNat Metcalf (right) celebrates with Helen Housby during the Netball World Cup in 2023. England finished as runners-up to Australia in South Africa.Photograph: Gallo Images/Getty ImagesAny concerns that arose about her own playing future were eased by her addition to a WhatsApp group of elite international athlete mothers, established by the Team GB and England hockey player Jo Pinner, and featuring 27 British women from 16 sports. All were either expecting children or had returned to sport after giving birth.“It was a space for anyone to share anything, ask for support or advice,” says Metcalf. “Just to know there was a space to reach out and have a little community around you, knowing there are other mums doing it as well. You’re not alone at all.“You’re following other mums’ journeys in this elite world, who are getting back into their sports at international level. Seeing them do that is so inspiring. It’s been amazing to be able to hear their stories.”There was no shortage of trailblazing mothers within netball to call upon either. The former England international, and now England Netball president, Eboni Usoro-Brown, played at the last Commonwealth Games after the birth of her daughter, while Iona Christian and Joyce Mvula are among current Netball Super League players with children. Inspiration could even be found on trips to her local park courts.“Going to my coaching clinics and seeing mums come up to me and tell me what they did to get back into the game was so inspiring,” says Metcalf. “I was like: ‘I want to be like you.’ I want to get back out there and say that I played netball again – back to this thing I absolutely love doing. The netball mum community has just been insane and I massively feel the love. When you’re a part of it, it just feels so special.”The best-laid plans for childbirth – and recovery – swiftly changed when Miller arrived via an emergency caesarean section, the severity of which left Metcalf often feeling physically “helpless” at the start.“I’ve always been someone who wants to keep active,” she recalls. “I remember feeling like I just needed to get out of the house and walk around the block. But, the first time, I walked to the end of the street and had to go back. I couldn’t do it.”Instead, she learned to embrace the new family’s “baby bubble”, where thoughts of netball and exercise were forgotten until she began craving movement again around two months after Miller’s birth. Aided by her husband’s remote working, Metcalf was able to return to her first England training camp with family in tow when Miller was three months old.View image in fullscreenNat Metcalf in action for England in Australia in 2022.Photograph: Mark Kolbe/Getty Images for Netball AustraliaThere remained the challenge of recalibrating her expectations to what her postpartum body could immediately achieve: “I was naive in thinking it would be a smooth recovery, your body picks up and off you go. I’ve had to learn a whole new way of moving. Not just the body moving, but managing the fatigue because you’re sleeping less.“It’s definitely been challenging. My joints and muscles have screamed at me in every place. At times I wondered if I was doing too much, too soon. I’ve had to really listen to my body.”A self-imposed lofty ambition had been to return to action six months after Miller was born. Having skipped last month’s 2-1 series defeat by New Zealand to continue the final stages of playing preparations, her imminent comeback against Jamaica will see her thrown straight back into the international arena before even returning to the domestic fold, with the next Netball Super League season not starting until February.It will be both entirely familiar and a step into the unknown, with her daughter watching on. “The memories I want to build in the netball world now are for Miller to see mummy do it,” she says. “It just makes it extra special.”Explore more on these topicsNetballEngland netball teaminterviewsShareReuse this content"

But their efforts unraveled when immigration officials abruptly issued an order to detain and deport her soon after she was flown into the US last month, a move that plunged the case into legal chaos.“Indeed, it is both preposterous and offensive for the government to bring someone into the United States against their will and then turn around and seek ICE detention because that person is here ‘illegally,’” magistrate judge Zia M Faruqui said in a written order.“The government needs to decide what its priorities are: ginning up deportation stats or prosecuting alleged criminals,” he added. He also described the situation “Kafkaesque” at a hearing in Washington DC on Monday according to theWashington Post, who first reported the case.In theindictment, Leonova is described as a logistics manager for North-West Airlines, a Moscow-based private charter carrier. Prosecutors allege she and her associates funneled roughly $2m in “sophisticated and sensitive aircraft equipment” from American suppliers through an Armenian company, circumventing export controls imposed after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.Leonova’s temporary authorization to stay in the US expired just two weeks after her arrival, leaving her, a Belarusian citizen living in Russia, trapped in legal limbo. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reportedly told the court they planned to deport her if she were released pending trial.At a court hearing Monday, however, an assistant US attorney said he had asked DHS to grant Leonova legal permission to remain in the country while she faces the smuggling and conspiracy charges outlined in the indictment, the Post reported.Leonova was arrested in France in September 2024 and spent several weeks in jail, followed by nearly a year under home confinement, before being extradited to the US last month. She has since been held in a Washington, DC detention facility.The bizarre situation is not exactly unique under the current administration. Earlier this year, another federal judgecompareda separate immigration case concerning the deportation of over 100Venezuelan mento a Salvadoran megaprison toThe Trialby Franz Kafka, in which the protagonist is prosecuted without knowing the nature or origin of the charges against him.Explore more on these topicsFBIICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Law (US)Trump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Following several meetings with these families this year and after careful consideration, I have decided that in the circumstances a statutory inquiry is the best way to ensure they get the truth and accountability they deserve.”The trust has been investigated in the past for its history of patient deaths, but Streeting claimed these prior investigations had not been “sufficiently comprehensive” and that not all deaths had been covered adequately.In April 2024,the trust was fined £215,000for offences relating to the care of two patients who died by suicide at its hospitals. The Care Quality Commission, which brought the prosecution, alleged that the trust failed to mitigate the known risks the patients were exposed to after previous self-harm incidents.Andy McDonald, the MP for nearby Middlesbrough and Thornaby East, said the announcement of an inquiry provided “a huge sense of relief and achievement reflecting years of tireless effort” from him and the loved ones of the deceased.“The dreadful events that claimed the lives of three young women, Christie Harnett, Nadia Sharif and Emily Moore, exposed a broader cultural malaise at Tees, Esk and Wear Valley NHS trust and many more families found themselves grieving the loss of their loved ones,” McDonald said.“We now know that there have been numerous patients and families disastrously failed and it is imperative that every family affected gets to the truth of what happened and how the system let them and their loved ones down so very badly.”Alison Smith, chief executive of Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS foundation trust, said: “First and foremost, I extend my deepest sympathy to everyone affected by these tragic losses.“With the public inquiry now confirmed, we will fully support the process with transparency, openness and humility. Above all, we are committed to listening, reflecting, and taking meaningful action to ensure that we continually improve as an organisation.”Explore more on these topicsNHSMental healthHealthEnglandWes StreetingYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

They’re highly specialised and highly skilled predators. To see them following dolphins as though they were leaders was really counterintuitive – and really exciting,” said Sarah Fortune, a marine scientist at Dalhousie University and the report’s lead author.Dolphins have often been spotted close to thenorthern resident orcas, an ecotype of the apex predator that subsists almost entirely on Chinook salmon. Dolphins lack the ability to hunt salmon, which are too big for them, normally relying on herring.Video footage in the research shows the dolphins – which Fortune said act as “scouts” – cutting seamlessly through the glassy waters of the Pacific in pursuit of the salmon, which can reach nearly three feet in length. The orcas follow closely behind.View image in fullscreenScientists watch the whales and dolphins from the research vessel Steller Quest.Photograph: Andrew Trites/MMRU/Institute for the Oceans and FisheriesWhen the whales catch their prey and break them apart at the surface to share with other orcas, the dolphins scavenged the leftovers.The whales, which are typically fiercely protective of freshly hunted prey, seem unbothered by the intrusion.Researchers examined multiple explanations for the proximity of the dolphins and the lack of aggression by the orcas.One theory suggested the dolphins were simply obtaining protection in the presence of the whales. Northern resident orcas do not prey on the dolphins, but Bigg’s orcas, which share the same waters, do. But the distinct ecotypes of whales largely avoid each other.Another theory was the dolphins obtained benefits by bow riding near the orcas, reducing drag.The team also weighed the possibility of kleptoparasitism, a term that refers to dolphins stealing scraps of food from the whales.“If the dolphins were parasites, just there for a free lunch, the whales might act aggressively towards them to get them to leave – or the killer whales themselves might leave and go feed in adjacent areas. But we really didn’t see evidence of antagonistic behaviours between species. And that really surprised us,” said Fortune.That left the researchers with the last and most tantalising explanation: the two predators were cooperating.“The killer whales were orienting themselves to follow the dolphins, and so the dolphins appeared to be in a leadership role,” said Fortune. “This really sparked our interest to look further into our data and try to see if we could figure out what was really going on.”To better study the hunt, three members of the team crammed into a small boat and tagged the whales with a large carbon fibre pole, attaching a camera with a suction cup that would eventually fall off.The tags, which recorded video and acoustics, continuously recorded dive data, along with vocalisations and feeding-related sounds, gave researchers a rare glimpse into interactions more than 100ft below the surface. Because the dolphins were so close to the whales, the tags often picked up the vocalisations of both mammals.“We’d often see this alternating pattern, where our tagged whale would echolocate, and then there’d be a period of silence, and the we’d hear dolphin echolocation clicks, and so those dolphins had to be close enough to the hydrophone that we could pick it up,” said Fortune. “And this raises a question: are both species listening to each other? Are they eavesdropping?”These rare whales had never been seen alive. Then a team in Mexico sighted twoRead moreFortune said the simultaneous echolocation by the two species also raised the prospect they could effectively increase the acoustic field of view, given the whales have a wide range to track fish.The team said more study is needed to determine the extent at which both species are benefiting from this interaction.“Is it that there is going to be something beneficial to both the dolphins and the killer whales,” said Fortune. “Do whales that hunt with dolphins end up as more successful at foraging than those that hunt without dolphins?”But the study has also reshaped and expanded the understanding of what whales and dolphins, both known for their intelligence, are capable of while hunting.“Most people are aware that killer whales have strong culture, and that they’re a very social species and specialised hunting strategies,” said Fortune. “But as social as they are, when it comes time to hunt and to catch salmon, they turn into lone wolves. To see them likely cooperatively hunting with another species shows how adaptable they are to changing and refining their hunting strategy.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentSeascape: the state of our oceansCetaceansWildlifeAnimal behaviourCanadaMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

It has distressed and alarmed local people and conservationists, as not only are the beads unsightly but they pose a deadly threat to wildlife.Scientists at King’s College London tested the beads and found they contained heavy metals including lead and arsenic.The local Labour MP, Helena Dollimore, is on Thursday launching a campaign with theWildlifeTrusts to get the use of these beads banned for good. There is no record held by the government or the regulator of how many water plants use these beads, the condition of the containers holding them, or the risk posed to the beaches near where they are kept.Campaigners will gather at Rye Harbour nature reserve, an internationally important habitat for rare wading birds, to call for the beads to be banned.Research by the Guardianfound at least 15 treatment works using these beads, all situated around the south and south-west coast of England. These plants are older, mostly built in the 1990s and early 2000s. They use billions of floating plastic beads to create layers of biofilm, bacteria that purify water, which are separated from the environment by a mesh screen. Recent technological advances mean water can now be purified using electric currents, and using fixed surfaces made of ceramic or concrete. There are similar but more costly products made of glass, which is less harmful to the environment.Dollimore, the MP for Hastings and Rye, said: “A month ago I wasn’t aware that these plastic beads were used in local wastewater plants until 320m washed up on our beaches and nature reserve, causing an environmental catastrophe. The use of beads is an outdated technology and better modern methods exist. So why are water companies still using them in coastal plants – the very place they could do most damage? We’re calling for them to bin the beads.”View image in fullscreenA spade-full of biobeads collected on Camber Sands.Photograph: Anna McGrath/The GuardianThe beads contain a high number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which have been linked to cancer. They often contain toxins including lead, antimony and bromine. Once in the sea they attract algae, making them smell like food to sea creatures, which then ingest them and can be poisoned.The local Wildlife Trust has been struggling to deal with the spillage. Conservationists have been working tirelessly to remove the beads, which has been difficult as they are embedded in fragile habitats including the saltmarsh and in the shingle. The trust said it would be ordering autopsies of dead birds found, to see if the beads were a cause of death. The nature reserve is loved by birds such as wigeon ducks because of the plentiful seeds found in the muddy flats; but these are identical in size to the biobeads, so it is likely they will be ingested.Henri Brocklebank, the director of conservation at the Sussex Wildlife Trust, said: “Rye Harbour nature reserve is internationally important for its birds, with species travelling thousands of miles to feed and breed here. Biobeads are small and buoyant, not dissimilar to many of the food items these birds are searching for. The impact of bioplastics accumulating in the digestive systems is well documented, but the effects of any contaminants that could be released in the acidic gut systems of these birds are far less understood. The removal of the biobeads from the environment is paramount, but I fear that our grandchildren will still be finding them in years to come.“There is only one way to guarantee that we never have a spill of biobeads again. That is to stop our wastewater treatment works from using them. They are an old and redundant technology and we must see their use ended swiftly.”The water minister, Emma Hardy, has written to water companies to find out the extent of their use of beads. The Environment Agency continues to investigate Southern Water after the spillage on Camber Sands.Southern Water apologised for the spill and said it was unable to comment on third-party testing.Defra has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsPollutionPlasticsWildlifeWater industryBirdsEast SussexnewsShareReuse this content"

This means 18 higher education institutions, or 12% of the sector, now refuse to advertise roles with fossil fuel companies to their students.Josie Mizen, co-director of climate justice atPeople and Planet, which carried out the study said: “We’re delighted to see a growing number of universities cutting their ties with the fossil fuel industry – the industry most responsible for fuelling the climate emergency.“We know that a just transition away from fossil fuels also requires an end to the funnelling of graduates into this dead-end industry, so we’re extremely encouraged by the fact that a record number of universities have committed to banning recruitment for these destructive companies over the past 12 months.”This year’s People and Planet university league ranks 147 UK universities against 14 criteria linked to climate and social justice.Universitiesare ranked using the typical grading system in UK higher education – given either a 1st, 2:1, 2:2, 3rd and fail.Manchester Metropolitan Universitycame out as the overall winner for a record fourth year, due to what campaigners said was a consistently high performance across all categories.It also scored highly for its energy sources and carbon reduction after investing in a major heat decarbonisation retrofit project to replace gas-fired heating systems and a combined heat and power system with highly efficient electric ground and water source heat pumps.Campaigners said this year’s analysis found many universities had taken bold steps in support of migrant rights, with the number of universities “divesting from private companies profiting from controlling, surveilling and preventing the movement of people seeking sanctuary” rising from six last year to 13 this year.Andre Dallas, co-director of migrant justice at People and Planet, said it marked an important stepin “delegitimising the border industry” after pressure from student groups across the country.“As government policy continues to double down on the scapegoating of migrating people, it is inspiring to see students and workers taking a stand to demand an alternative future characterised by compassion rather than cruelty.”New universities, formed after the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, continue to lead the way in sustainability in higher education with eight in the top 10 places. These institutions have often been early adopters of actions such as ending recruitment links with fossil fuel companies and divesting from the border industry.Just three Russell Group universities scored a 1st class award this year, down from six, two years ago. The University of Oxford has jumped 30 places and keeps a 2:1, while the University of Cambridge has jumped 10 places from a 3rd to a 2:2.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The report stated that Reform had “clearly set out its desire to avoid a maximum council tax increase” but warned for every 1% reduction, the council would have to make further cuts of £4.2m.Several Reform-led local authorities are facing scrutiny afterannouncing proposals for council tax rises,including Kent, Leicestershire and North Northamptonshire, despite promises during the election campaigns to cut costs.In a statement on Wednesday, the leader of Leicestershire county council, Dan Harrison, said: “A council tax freeze is our aspiration but conditions are unlikely to allow this for next year.” On Monday, North Northamptonshire confirmed plans to increase council tax next year by 4.99%.Stephen Atkinson, Reform UK’s senior local government figure and the leader of Lancashire council, told the Financial Times on Thursday that council tax risescould not be ruled outand dismissed claims that the party had promised to cut council tax.In response to the board’s report, opposition leaders in Warwickshire accused Reform of making “rash promises” and “soundbites” during the election campaign.The leader of the Liberal Democrats at Warwickshire council, Jerry Roodhouse, said: “Reform at the elections made rash promises about using Doge in Warwickshire. [It] never happened and if they think they can reduce council tax, I would like them to make clear what cuts they are planning.“Clearly Reform made soundbites with no real research into the financial position [of] local authorities.”The leader of the Green party, Jonathan Chilvers, said: “Reform told voters here that Warwickshire council ‘wasted vast amounts of taxpayer money, yet keep raising your council tax’. If that’s true, Reform in Warwickshire will be able to bring forward a budget that will freeze council tax without cutting the frontline services that residents rely [on]. Given today’s report, there’s no sign [of] the moment that they’ll be able to do that.”In a response to the report, the leader of Warwickshire county council, George Finch, said the recommendations by officers “reflect a starting assumption” of taking the maximum council tax increase to “ensure financial resilience and sustainability”.He said the recommendations would be considered by all political parties and the authority was waiting for the government to publishfunding allocations for councils this month.Reform took control of 10 English local authorities after local elections in May, winning almost 700 seats.During the campaign, the party promised a drastic cost-cutting plan to target “waste and inefficiencies” at councils in the style of Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) in the US.The local authorities will present their budget proposals next year with council tax rates agreed in late winter or early spring.Explore more on these topicsReform UKWarwickshireLocal governmentLocal electionsLocal politicsCouncil taxEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The tribunal, before the employment judge Sandy Kemp, also dismissed her claim against Upton, whose evidence was held to be “more reliable and materially more cohesive in nature”.Telling supporters in Dundee that she would “not be giving up the fight any time soon”, the appeal will be one of four cases that Peggie is pursuing – including actions against NHS Fife’s management, senior medical staff and the Royal College ofNursing, her trade union, claiming it failed to support her when she was suspended, something it denies.Thanking her family, friends and campaign supporters who had gathered for a press conference in Dundee on Thursday afternoon, Peggie said she had been “overwhelmed by the messages of support” from across the UK and beyond.The announcement came as questions emerged about misquotations in Monday’s ruling, some of which appear to change the original meaning of legal references.On Thursday, the tribunal issued a “certificate of correction” stating there had been “clerical mistake(s), error(s)or omissions(s)”, and changed one reference to the judgment inMaya Forstater’s landmark case, which established that gender critical views were protected in law.The ruling initially quoted Forstater’s case as emphasising that the Equality Act did not create “a hierarchy of protected characteristics”. Forstater, however, pointed out on social media that the judgment did no such thing, and that the quote was “completely made up”. It has now been removed and replaced with an accurate citation.Forstater, who now heads the campaign group Sex Matters and attended Peggie’s event on Thursday, said she was concerned that no explanation had been given for how the error occurred. She pointed to at least three other instances where the ruling used quotes that “don’t reflect the case law” and consequently “severely undermine people’s confidence in the legal process”.“Questions about these stark errors need to be answered by the judiciary,” Forstater said.Margaret Gribbon, Peggie’s solicitor, said work on the appeal was now under way, and that some of the tribunal’s findings were “hugely problematic”.“For instance, the judgment places responsibility on female employees to raise complaints if they feel uncomfortable about sharing single-sex spaces with men. This ignores industrial realities. When Sandie objected, she was suspended, subjected to an unreasonably lengthy disciplinary investigation and falsely accused of patient care concerns.”Gribbon continued: “The judgment also places employers in the invidious position of having to make decisions about single-sex workplace facilities based on the physical appearance of transgender employees, and by asking them intrusive questions.”Reading from her own statement, Peggie said: “I am not a campaigner and had never heard of the phrase ‘gender-critical’ when I first raised complaints over two years ago about my employer’s decision to allow men into female-only changing rooms. I just knew instinctively that it wasn’t right that women were expected to undress in front of men in private spaces and I still believe this to be the case.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandEmployment tribunalsTransgenderWork & careersNHSNursingnewsShareReuse this content"

It also said Drax would face substantial penalties if it failed to use 100% woody biomass from sustainable sources, up from the current level of 70%.The Guardian revealed last month that a report by forestry experts had found that Drax continuedto burn 250-year-old treessourced from some of Canada’s oldest forests despite growing scrutiny of its sustainability claims.That followed a 2022 report by the BBC that detailed similar findings, and the start of investigation this year by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, over “historical statements” made by Drax about the sourcing of wood pellets to examine whether the company had complied with disclosure and transparency rules. The investigation is ongoing.The report by the Canadian NGO Stand.earth suggested it was highly likely that Britain’s biggest power plant sourced some wood from ecologically valuable forests as recently as this summer even while lobbying the government for further subsidies.Drax dismissed the report in an official filing to the US market after its publication. It told the Guardian that it uses sources woody biomass only from “well-managed, sustainable forests” and not from “designated areas of old growth”. These areas amount to less than half of all the old-growth forest areas in British Columbia.Explore more on these topicsDraxEnergy industryArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

However, some opponents of the bill say the lengthy consideration of amendments is normal for a complex issue and that it has been up to peers to attempt to address a series of significant concerns about the bill, including from key professional bodies like the Royal College of Psychiatrists.In their letter, Madders, Abrahams and Griffiths said there was increasing concern among MPs about the role unelected Lords have been playing in legislation. There is also significant anger about a separate government bill – the employment rights bill – which wasblocked for a third time in the Lordson Wednesday night.House of Lords’ block on assisted dying bill is a big risk | LetterRead moreThey said the Lords often did good work scrutinising legislation, but that an unelected house should not have the final say. “The fact that it is unelected can only be tolerated in a democracy provided its members accept that it is for the House of Commons to have the last word on what becomes law and what doesn’t in this country,” the letter said.“If the Lords resort to blocking procedures, and impede the implementation of decisions taken in the Commons, this is effectively breaking this convention, so how long should we as the democratically elected chamber put up with it?”The three MPs said they had voted against the bill as a matter of conscience but that it had passed with a convincing majority. “The question now is: is it acceptable for the Lords simply to keep talking in an attempt to reach the end of the parliamentary session without ever getting to a vote? The answer to that must be no.“Or, if they do get to a vote, and they reject the will of the Commons, what should happen next? The expectation is clearly that, within a reasonable timeframe, the decision of the democratically elected chamber should take precedence.“Any attempt to derail that process not only breaks convention, it also risks setting a precedent which would undoubtedly increase the calls for a radical reform of theHouse of Lordssooner rather than later.”Senior cross-benchers, including the former independent terrorism reviewer Lord Carlile, are now attempting to mediate between the two sides to try to move through amendments faster.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators in favour of and against the assisted dying bill in Parliament Square, London, in June.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAA major constitutional pressure group, Unlock Democracy, has also launched a campaign this week saying that peers are “filibustering” the bill in an anti-democratic effort to “sabotage” its progress.The group, which does not take a position on assisted dying, has written to the Labour peer Lord Falconer, who will lead on the bill in the Lords, asking him to “move heaven and earth” to get it to make progress.But those opposed to the bill argue there is no constitutional reason why the Lords should not prevent the passage of the bill, seeing as it was not in any party’s manifesto.A letter from seven peers including Lady Luciana Berger argued the equivalent norm for a bill that had spent 11 days in committee in the House of Commons would be 16 days sitting in the Lords committee stage.“Scrutiny should never be conflated with obstruction. Our entire purpose at this stage is to take note of the concerns of experts and professionals, and to propose amendments which aim to interrogate the detail, and demonstrate where improvement is needed,” the letter said.There has also been significant unease among peers after the Guardian revealed last week that Labourhad proposed in a leaked internal briefingwhile in opposition that a private member’s bill would be the right vehicle to introduce assisted dying.Senior opponents said they were confident they had the numbers to halt the bill at third reading if it reached that stage after the consideration of all the amendments.On Friday, peers will debate the fourth day of amendments to the bill – with six more scheduled for the new year – including an amendment from Carlile, which would restore the role of a high court judge in deciding applications for an assisted death.Carlile’s amendment, which has growing support among peers, would allow designated family judges as well as those in the high court family division to decide on cases, which its supporters argue would deal with the fears around court capacity.But opponents argue that it could still cause significant backlogs in the courts. Kim Leadbeater, the bill’s original sponsor, dropped the original role of the high court judge from her bill in the Commons, preferring a panel of experts including a senior lawyer, a psychiatrist and social worker to decide applications.Carlile and a number of other senior crossbenchers have said they hoped the bill can start to make significant progress. “I’m a longstanding opponent of assisted suicide legislation,” he told the Guardian. “But the difference with this legislation is this has been passed by the Commons.“And I think that it is required of the Lords to self-discipline so that we get through the legal processes so there can be a vote on the principle at third reading. Then perhaps it will be defeated at third reading. And if it passes at third reading, I’m confident having gone through the processes it will be one of the safest, if not the safest, in the world.”The assisted dying campaigner Dame Esther Rantzen, one of the most outspoken advocates for the bill, who has stage-four lung cancer, was intending to address peers this week but has been too unwell.In a message sent to peers, she said that any new law would not be in time for her but that she was “extremely concerned that the House of Lords is using process in an unprecedented way, sabotaging the bill rather than proposing genuine amendments, and this filibustering risks denying this issue the proper scrutiny it deserves”.A cross-party group of MPs backing the bill also released a letter to peers on Thursday saying the bill “runs a serious risk of running out of time and falling, not on its merits but as a result of political manoeuvring”.The letter is signed by two Tory former cabinet ministers, Kit Malthouse and Andrew Mitchell, as well as the Reform deputy leader, Richard Tice, the chair of the health select committee, Layla Moran, and four Labour select committee chairs.“Ignoring the clear and consistent support of a majority of the public would further damage faith in our democratic processes,” it says.But Mark Elliott, a professor of public law at the University of Cambridge, said there was no constitutional reason why peers should feel bound to pass the bill. “There is no general principle requiring the Lords to yield to the Commons. But the current constitutional position is clear: it is open to the Lords to reject this private members’ bill.”Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingHouse of LordsEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Khan said the official had argued that issuing arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, the former Israeli defence minister, was disproportionate.Khan also claimed that in April 2024 he was warned by a US official there would be disastrous consequences if he were to issue the warrants, but Khan – faced with calls to delay – insisted during the call there had been no sign the Israeli government was willing to cooperate with the ICC or change its behaviour.He claimed that in a further call on 1 May the US senator Lindsey Graham warned him that applying arrest warrants meantHamasmay as well shoot Israeli hostages.Khan said he had learned for the first time about sexual misconduct allegations against him on 2 May. He said that on 6 May a third party revealed that someone without the alleged victim’s consent had issued a complaint about his behaviour to the court’s watchdog, the internal oversight mechanism. When the victim said she did not wish to pursue an investigation the matter was dropped until an anonymous account on X started to reopen the allegations in October, he said.Khan’s submission seeks to portray him as acting neutrally throughout and not seeking to advance his personal interests. He said the plan to issue the arrest warrant preceded the allegations against him.He added that it would be wrong of the applicants to rely on conjecture from select media reports in order to advance unsupported assertions that there were grounds for disqualification, insisting his preparation for the case was meticulous.It is understood that Khan insisted on sending a full and pugnacious 22-page response to the Israeli request for dismissal of the warrants after he read what he regarded as a relatively tame response that was initially drafted.He said he had assembled a panel of experts on international law to assess whether or not the ICC had jurisdiction and if a case should be brought against Netanyahu, Gallant and three Hamas officials.Explore more on these topicsInternational criminal courtBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warIsraelHamasInternational criminal justicePalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

Will admission to the USA be predicated on being nice about the president? That would be censorship pure and simple and the result will extend far beyond as people start to self-censor to keep the door to the USA open to them.”Amnesty International UK called the plan “wildly out of proportion to any legitimate border need”.“This moment shows how ‘slippery slopes’ on human rights suddenly become cliffs. Years of unchecked data-trawling at borders, including the UK’s, have led us here,” said Javier Ruiz Diaz, the group’s technology and human rights lead.The Big Brother Watch campaign group called the plan “the latest evidence of the Trump administration’s enthusiasm for shredding civil liberties in the name of border control and national security”.“The US government would each year have access to millions of years’ worth of social media content, the vast majority of which includes speech that is legal in the United States,” said Matthew Feeney, the group’s advocacy manager. “This would encourage millions of law-abiding people, including many American citizens, to self-censor criticism of the US government. So much for the Trump administration’s commitment to free speech.”In Brussels, Trump’s move was described as “ironic” given his criticism of the EU’s €120m fine of Elon Musk’s X platform last week as “nasty”. The border measures were “a dramatic overreach and breach of fundamental rights,” said theGerman MEP Birgit Sippel, a member of the European Parliament’s committee on civil Liberties, justice and home affairs.Minky Worden, the director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said the new entry requirements were “an outrageous demand that violates fundamental free speech and free expression rights”, according to Politico.Trump said on Wednesday: “We want safety. We want security. We want to make sure we’re not letting the wrong people come into our country.”Asked on Thursday how it would protect its employees from the checks, the European Commission described the policy as “floated plans”. “We haven’t seen any confirmation of this plan, so there’s no need for us to further speculate,” a spokesperson said.The UK-based Free Speech Union, led by Toby Young, also declined to comment, saying it had a policy of not commenting on free speech issues in other countries.The move sparked some darkly comic responses. The X account of the UK satirical news programme Have I Got News for You said: “The US border force is considering ‘social media checks’ for visitors before allowing them entry, which is fine because we’ve always said Trump’s ideas are great and he’s a good person.”Seth Bannon, an investor from San Francisco, said: “This is insane. China is preparing to require tourists to hand over five years of social media history, all email addresses and phone numbers used in the last five years, and the freaking names and addresses of family members. No thanks won’t be visiting anytime soon!”He followed up with a post saying: “Oh no whoops no that’s the US, not China.”Jon Cooper, a former campaign chair for Barack Obama, said: “This is insane. It will DECIMATE the US tourism industry.” Paul Barry, an investigative journalist based in Australia, added: “Bang goes that US trip.”Within the past five years, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, has posted on X that the Trump supporters who rioted at the Capitol in 2021 were part of “a direct attack on democracy and legislators carrying out the will of the American people”.Going back further than the five years of social media posts that would be checked, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, called Trump in 2017 an “odious, sad, little man”. The same year, the technology secretary, Liz Kendall, who is holding meetings in Silicon Valley this week, accused Trump on X of “degrading [the] office of the president” over a tax bill that benefited the super-rich and said: “Trump & Putin don’t want ‘real’ news, they want silence”.Jeremy Bradley, an expert in privacy and the managing director of Zama, a cryptography company based in Paris, said it was wrong to treat someone’s online history as a permanent record of their beliefs, because people’s views changed.“Personal choice and freedom of expression shouldn’t be sacrificed in the name of surveillance, especially when it chills speech and curtails basic freedoms,” he said. “Privacy isn’t just a technical issue; it’s about dignity and the freedom to be human.”X, TikTok and Meta, which operates Instagram, Facebook and Threads, were approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationSocial mediaUS politicsTravel & leisureFreedom of speechCensorshipnewsShareReuse this content"

They warned that the Afghans risked “persecution, abuse and death” if they were returned.Karl Kopp, the head of the German NGO Pro Asyl, criticised the government’s decision as “ice cold”.He added: “The previous government promised to take these people in for one reason only: they had fought for women’s rights, human rights and freedom in Afghanistan.”The people affected were now in acute danger and at risk of falling into the hands of the Islamist Taliban regime, he said. “For the new government, this shameful treatment of people in mortal danger is a declaration of moral bankruptcy.”After theTaliban’s return to powerfour years ago, Germany’s then centre-left-led government launched programmes offering refuge to “especially endangered people” including local staff who had worked for the German military or government ministries, as well as rights activists and journalists.Until April 2025, before Merz took office in May, about 4,000 local staff and 15,000 of their family members had been resettled in Germany, according to official data.Since then, a few hundred Afghans have been evacuated fromPakistanbut the current government has largely moved to phase out that policy, offering money to those who renounce their right to be resettled. The interior ministry said last month only 62 people had taken up the offer.Up to 1,800 Afghans approved for relocation to Germany have been stranded in Pakistan for months, NGOs say.The interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, has spearheaded many of the government’s toughest measures to block new arrivals.He has concluded that only Afghanswith a “legally binding” promise should remain eligible for resettlement. The interior ministry said this would cover only 90 of the 220 local staff still awaiting evacuation.A former local police training officer and father of fourtold the daily Frankfurter Rundschauthat he had waited two years to enter Germany and was shocked by the decision. “In a single moment, all my hopes and dreams of a normal life were shattered,” he was quoted as saying.The military affairs reporter Thomas Wiegold said the about-face could have long-term consequences for any future missions abroad. “German soldiers can only fervently hope that they will never, ever, ever again be dependent on local support anywhere,” he wrote on Bluesky.More than 250 NGOs issued an open letter this week criticising the government for failing to honour Berlin’s promises to Afghans left in limbo, 70% of whom, they noted, are women and children.Groups including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and religious organisations called on the government to evacuate all 1,800 people before the end of the year – the deadline announced by the Pakistani government for them to leave.Last year, Germany resumed deportations to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, with the then chancellor, Olaf Scholz, promising a more aggressive approach to removals of those with a criminal record.Several such flights have taken placeunder the current government, even as the foreign ministry warns of widespread human rights violations in Afghanistan, including “torture, extrajudicial killings, corporal punishment and public executions”.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanGermanyFriedrich MerzEuropeSouth and central AsiaThe far rightPakistannewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities in the country, which is part of the three-member Alliance of Sahel States (AES), called the landing an “unfriendly act carried out in defiance of international law” in a statement that evening.The Nigerian air force said technical concerns had forced the plane to divert to the nearest airport “in line with standard safety procedures and international aviation protocols”. The Burkinabé authorities had treated the crew courteously and plans were under way to continue the mission, it said.Conspiracy theories began circulating on social media and offline given that the landing came within 24 hours of Nigerian troops helping to thwart a coup attempt in Benin, which borders Nigeria and Burkina Faso.The AES trio of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger officially left the larger Ecowas regional bloc in January, forming a military alliance as it withdrew from many of its traditional local and international allegiances.Explore more on these topicsBurkina FasoNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It will place “imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we’ve never seen before”, he claimed.The deal is OpenAI’s most prominent move into Hollywood after a contentious rollout of Sora and longstanding pushback against AI from many entertainment industry workers. Concerns from writers, actors, visual effects artists and other creatives over AI replacing jobs and using likenesses without consent has led to union protests andcopyright lawsuitsagainst AI companies.View image in fullscreenExamples from an OpenAI press release.Photograph: OpenAIWhen OpenAI launched its latest iteration of Sora earlier this year, it immediately ran intoa slew of potential copyright issues, as feeds became dominated by videos featuring characters such as SpongeBob SquarePants or Pikachu – sometimes generated to appear in Nazi-like clothing.Racist depictions of Martin Luther King Jr prompted OpenAI to ban the use of his likeness on the platform, while the daughter of Malcolm Xcalled seeing her father’s imageon Sora “deeply disrespectful and hurtful”.Disney itself has also been concerned over the unauthorized use of its characters by generative AI platforms. The company sent a stern cease-and-desist letter to the Character.AI chatbot firm in October, alleging that the platform was “blatantly infringing on Disney’s copyrights” through using the likeness of its characters.On Wednesday evening, attorneys representing Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, demanding that the technology company’s AI systems stop alleged infringement, Varietyreported.The OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, has been on a charm offensive that included a recent appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, the US talkshow. On Thursday, he touted the firm’s deal with Disney as proof that artificial intelligence companies could partner with the entertainment sector.“This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences,” Altman said.In addition to Disney letting its characters appear in Sora, the company will also use OpenAI’s application programming interfaces to build new products and tools, becoming a major customer of the ChatGPT maker. A selection of the videos made by users on Sora will also be available for streaming on the Disney+ platform. It will also deploy ChatGPT for its employees, the companies said.“Technological innovation has continually shaped the evolution of entertainment, bringing with it new ways to create and share great stories with the world,” said Iger. “The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessOpenAIWalt Disney CompanyArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Several large companies, includingAstraZenecaandUS company MSD/Merck, then cancelled or paused large UK investments.The government has also been pressed intospending 25% more on new NHS medicinesas part of a zero tariff deal with the US administration.Donald Trump, the US president, has criticised other rich countries for paying too little for drugs, leaving the US to shoulder much of the cost of medicines. US prices have historically been much higher, partly because of a complex system of intermediaries.The National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence (Nice), which assesses drugs for use on the NHS, will for the first time raise the price threshold at which new medicines are seen to be cost-effective.In a consultation document published on Tuesday, the Department of Health went further and said it wanted to give ministers a limited powerto set the cost-effectiveness thresholdfor new drugs.Spending on medicines is expected to increase by about £1bn over the next three years, depending on which medicines Nice decides to approve and the actual uptake, according to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI). This has raised concerns about less money to pay for health staff and equipment.The government says the revenue clawback rate for new medicines will drop to 14.5% next year but payment rates for older, branded medicines will remain unchanged at between 10% and 35%.“It’s good that the amount of revenue companies will need to pay to the UK government has come down in 2026,” said Richard Torbett, the chief executive of the ABPI.Torbett also said the proposed 15% cap for the next three years should give companies more certainty but it was just a first step in making Britain more competitive: “Payment rates remain much higher than in similar countries, and there is work to do to accelerate the NHS’s adoption and use of cost-effective medicines to improve patient care.”In her interview with the BBC, Walmsley said GSK would not “shy away” from its interests in the US, where it makes half of its revenues.GSK recently outlined plans to invest $30bn(£23bn) in the US by 2030.Explore more on these topicsGSKAstraZenecaPharmaceuticals industryTariffsNHSHealthDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

This year’s top ten contains no operas. There has been a profound change in record companies’ policies of how and what they record. The glitzy, studio-based opera recordings of the last century now seem impossible to contemplate, and even releasing audio-only recordings taken directly from live opera-house performances often seems less viable than issuing DVDs of the same productions.Some specialist labels devoted to specific areas of the operatic repertoire continue sterling work: operas feature prominently inBru Zane’s mission on behalf of neglected French composers, whileOpera Raracontinues to crusade for forgotten, mostly 19th century, mostly Italian, scores which this year included the original 1857 version of Verdi’s Simon Boccanegra. Other companies continue to find treasures in Europe’s apparently inexhaustible baroque archives, while, on its own label, the London Symphony Orchestra has continued to releaseSimon Rattle’s Janáček series taken from his concert performanceswith the orchestra at the Barbican, the latest release beingJenůfa. If full-length operas are notably scarce in the schedules of the major companies, two exceptions this year wereDecca’s releaseof the Oslo-sourcedFlying Dutchman, with Lise Davidsen and Gerald Finley, and Deutsche Grammophon’sLady Macbeth of Mtsensk, part of Andris Nelson’s Boston-based Shostakovich series, both of which proved less than overwhelming.Other areas of the recorded repertory have continued to expand in their own, often cheerfully haphazard, ways. While the central symphonic repertoire generally remains oversubscribed, so that, say, a new cycle of Beethoven symphonies has to have a selling point other than its intrinsic musical worth, some composers do seem immune to overcrowding: at least two high-profile Mahler cycles are under way, and though the latest instalment of Semyon Bychkov’s series with the Czech Philharmonic,the Third Symphony, was disappointingly pallid,Simon Rattle’s account of the Seventh, with the Bavarian Radio Symphony was anything but, and belongs among the finest versions of this perplexing work available on disc.The series of recordings of mostly British music from John Wilson and his Sinfonia of London often revisit well-explored territory, too, but the quality of the orchestral playing is invariably so high it justifies the release itself. The superlative standard of the performances on their own label from the Berlin Philharmonic under Kirill Petrenko similarly needs no excuse, but this year’s Schoenberg collection is exceptional even by the usual Berlin standards, for it includes an outstanding account of a real rarity,the oratorio Die Jakobsleiter, a torso which, as Petrenko shows, contains some of the greatest music of Schoenberg’s freely atonal period during the first world war.As in almost every year, there are more superlative discs of piano music than can reasonably be included in a roundup such as this. There was no room, for instance, forAlice Sara Ott’s affectionate survey of John Field’s Nocturnes,Bertrand Chamayou’s glittering Ravel tribute orTamara Stefanovich’s coruscating accounts of 20th-century piano sonatas by Shostakovich, Eisler, Bartók and Boulez. And the release on disc of the performance of Rachmaninov’s Third Piano Concerto with whichYunchan Limwon the 2022 Van Cliburn competition to launch himself internationally is a document for posterity, whilePierre-Laurent Aimard’s performances of a generous selection of the miniatures in György Kurtág’s Jatékok, recorded in the composer’s presence, have an unrepeatable authority.Though there were plenty of concerts paying tribute to Pierre Boulez on his centenary, there were surprisingly few new discs marking the event, thoughQuatuor Diotima’s first ever recording of the final version of Livre pour Quatuor, and especially thecoupling on Bastille Musiqueof the rarely recorded Éclat/Multiples and Sur Incises, were important additions to the Boulez discography. Luciano Berio’s centenary was shamefully neglected, both in the concert hall and on disc, but the Diotima’s recording did offer another birthday tribute that was equally significant, equally definitive, as they marked Helmut Lachenmann’s 90th birthday with impressively authoritative accounts of his three string quartets.Andrew ClementsOur top 10 albums of 20251.Schoenberg: Violin Concerto, Verklärte Nacht, Die Jakobsleiter/Berlin Philharmonic/Petrenko(Berliner Philharmoniker)View image in fullscreenThe Berlin Philharmonic perform at the Philharmonie Berlin.Photograph: Stephan Rabold/BPHR/Stephan Rabold“An impressive collection … in a superb account of the Violin Concerto, the soloist, Patricia Kopatchinskaja, turns what can sometimes seem a rather four-square, dutifully conventional piece into something constantly surprising.”Read the full review.2.Mahler: Symphony No 7/Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra/Rattle(BR Klassik)View image in fullscreenShiveringly vivid … Simon Rattle conducting the Bavarian RSO.Photograph: Astrid Ackermann“It’s the sheer brilliance of the BRSO’s playing that grabs the attention, every detail and instrumental effect shiveringly vivid, and all perfectly captured in sound that is so much better than either of Rattle’s earlier versions.”Read the full review.3.Kurtág: Játékok/Pierre-Laurent Aimard(Pentatone)View image in fullscreenPierre-Laurent Aimard (left) and György Kurtág, during the recording sessions.Photograph: Balint Hrotko“Whole worlds of expression are encapsulated in just a few bars, and listening to Aimard’s exemplary performances provides as important an insight into Kurtág’s very personal musical thinking as any of his larger-scale, more ‘public’ pieces.

Dozens of people queued for hours for the privilege.Photograph: Sipa/ShutterstockView image in fullscreenLe Monde front page on Tuesday.Photograph: Le MondeIt was at the Arles photography festival that Parr first came to be appreciated as a serious artist, when his Last Resort series of images of the working-class seaside resort of New Brighton, Merseyside, was featured at the summer event in Provence in 1986; he was invited to curate the festival as guest artistic director in 2004.“I think Parr felt for a long time he was neglected in England,”said Bajac, the director of the Jeu de Paume arts centre in Paris. “But here it was a real love affair since the 1990s.Nul n’est prophète en son pays,we say in France. ‘No one is a prophet in their own land.’”The British photographer is best known for pictures that document characteristically English pastimes – holidays in seaside resorts, tea parties, vegetable-growing competitions – but the humorous tone of his work gave him a global appeal.View image in fullscreenMartin Parr speaking at Paris Photo, Grand Palais, France, in 2019.Photograph: Alfonso Jimenez/Shutterstock“Parr was an Englishman through and through,” said Andreas Wellnitz, a German picture editor and visual consultant for the colour supplement of the weekly Die Zeit. “But you could identify with his pictures anywhere in the world.”“Normal people could find themselves within his photographs because he found beauty in the everyday,” said Wellnitz, who worked on several projects with Parr from 2011 onwards. “His pictures managed to be neither boring nor cynical.”Germany was one country where, Parr’s influence played out less via galleries than through print. At the award-winning supplement of Die Zeit, Parr’s use of harsh flash and saturated colours proved as influential as those of the lifestyle photographers turned artists Wolfgang Tillmans and Jürgen Teller.View image in fullscreenA visitor takes in The Last Resort series during an exhibition of Martin Parr’s work at the NRW-Forum in Düsseldorf, Germany, in 2019.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyIn the US, the British photographer’s eye for the garish and absurd turned out to be a natural match for the gonzo journalism of Vice, the Canadian-American lifestyle magazine.Martin Parr: the photographer’s career in picturesRead more“Parr’s influence on American photography feels boundless,” said Elizabeth Renstrom, a former photo editor at Vice, pointing to the scrappy, flash-heavy aesthetic that came to define the magazine’s early photographic journalism.“His saturated colours, brazen closeness, and willingness to let the absurd sit shoulder to shoulder with the sincere offered young American photographers a visual vocabulary that didn’t apologise for being blunt.“In the Vice universe, this translated into assignments that felt both confrontational and conspiratorial, the kind of imagery that winks at you while documenting something undeniably real,” Renstrom added.In 2018, the magazine covered the midterm elections not just directly from the campaign trail but from thehome of “the original Donald”, Disney World. “Parr showed that humour wasn’t a detour from truth but a way into it.”View image in fullscreenMartin Parr speaks to people at a photo exhibition at the Blindspot Gallery in Hong Kong in 2014.Photograph: Kees Metselaar/AlamyIn Britain, reservations about his work have centred around the question of how much that humour relies on cliches and stereotypes: working-class Britons with sunburnt backs, middle-class Britons with socks and sandals, fascinators and top hats at Ascot.‘I drunkenly hugged him and said I love you, Martin Parr!’ Grayson Perry, Don McCullin and more on Britain’s national photographerRead moreParr himself was critical of the use of cliche in photography – his own and that of others. “I have come to the conclusion that we too are fairly predictable in what we photograph,” he said in a2010 speechthat condemned tropes such as The New Rich, The Bent Lamp-post and The Modern Typology. “We need to consider our subject matter more carefully,” he added.Curators who worked with Parr outside Britain, however, say his anthropological gaze always went deeper. “He was great at engaging with people,” said Wellnitz. “He wasn’t just interested in capturing cliches but learning about people.”If photographic projects in the first half of his career were mostly focused on English places and social groups, Parr applied his later lens to locations across the globe, including Hong Kong, the Acropolis in Athens, the Amalfi coast and Machu Picchu. His interest in Asian photographic traditions brought forth two books he compiled and edited, 2004’s The Photobook: A History, Volume 1, which highlighted Japan’s central role in the genre, and 2015’s The Chinese Photobook.Martin Parr catches the cherry blossom season in Kyoto – in picturesRead moreOne of his first projects abroad, Japonais Endormis, a 1998 photobook of people who had fallen asleep on the Tokyo metro, fostered a lasting bond with Japan. “There is a huge appreciation for observational photography in Japan, and Martin’s added humour and irony translate well here,” said Lucille Reyboz and Yusuke Nakanishi, the directors of the Kyotographie photography festival.For the 2025 festival, the pair invited Parr to document the impact of overtourism on famous Kyoto sites such as the Kinkaku-ji temple or the city’s cherry blossom spots. Japan’s national public broadcaster NHK followed Parr around for several days. “Martin offered affection and critique without cliche, and his profoundly human gaze on Kyoto will resonate here forever,”Reyboz and Nakanishi said.If Parr in Britain is remembered as a satirical chronicler of English traditions, his status in countries such as France and Japan has come to be that of a political artist monitoring modernity. Global Warning, a Parr retrospective opening at Jeu de Paume in late January next year, will focus on recurring themes of consumer excess, the prevalence of car culture and our dependence on technology.View image in fullscreenMartin Parr takes photographs in Japan, where he developed a last bond after a photobook project in 1998.Photograph: Artist/Hiroshi Yamauchi“While his work often focused on ‘Englishness’, Japanese audiences often responded more to the humour and satire in his work, and its universal commentaries on human behaviour, consumerism and globalisation,” said Reyboz and Nakanishi.Explore more on these topicsMartin ParrPhotographyFranceJapanExhibitionsClass issuesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a nauseatingly schmaltzy and nonsensicalRachel AroestiThu 11 Dec 2025 03.01 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 11.50 ESTShareTrevor Bingley is not Mr Bean, but the two have a few things in common. For a start, they are both self-destructively single-minded when it comes to overcoming trivial annoyances. In Netflix’s 2022 seriesMan vs Bee, Bingley ended up building a fake explosive-laced hive to destroy the insect who refused to vacate the swish home he was house-sitting; for Bean, life consists almost exclusively of finding absurd solutions to minor problems. Both are pitiable figures: Bean because he’s a walking disaster zone; Bingley because he’s lonely and broke, having lost numerous jobs due to general ineptitude. Last but not least, they are both embodied by Rowan Atkinson, who bestows the pair with his distinctive brand of sprightly ungainliness.There are major differences, however. Bingley is a human who can talk, is aware of social niceties and has a backstory, which mainly features a teenage daughter he dotes on and gratingly refers to as “Sweetpea”. Bean, on the other hand, was essentially beamed in from space: some episodes of the original 1990s series open with him dropping from the sky bathed in an alien light source.Still, Man vs Bee – co-created by Atkinson and writer Will Davies – was essentially Bean reimagined for the streaming age: a comedy with a backdrop of aspirational luxury that managed to pull off the sort of scream-inducingly stressful and satisfyingly callback-laced farce the viewing public has lately been starved of. Man vs Bee also had a strong sentimental streak: clearly our hearts were supposed to bleed for Bingley, who wanted to take his daughter camping but had to cancel because of his new job. It wasn’t exactly a tragedy of epic proportions (until he ended up in prison, that is), but it did make sense. Do not expect the same for its follow-up.View image in fullscreenCosy British Christmascore … Man vs Baby.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/NetflixIn Man vs Baby, Bingley is back, struggling to make ends meet in a chocolate-box village in the home counties. It’s Christmas and he has just been let go as a primary school caretaker. His final job is to assist with the nativity (the opportunity to shamelessly channel Love Actually is not wasted). There, he discovers a baby on the doorstep; this must be the local child starring as Jesus in the play!Except, worryingly, it’s not – so when Bingley lands a last-minute, lucrative housesitting gig in central London, he tries to hand over the baby to the police (too busy to help) then social services, who assume the child is a figment of Bingley’s imagination after he temporarily misplaces it in his house. (Save your screams of incomprehension, there’s so much more senselessness to come.) There’s only one thing for it: smuggle the anonymous baby into the penthouse flat he’s looking after over the festive period and hope the authorities collect it sharpish.It goes about as smoothly as it possibly could. Bingley is – lest we forget for one sweetpea-ing second – a devoted father, so he broadly knows how to care for a baby. Yes, he makes eccentric choices (a cork is subbed in for a dummy), but generally lives harmoniously with the infant as he waits for a bizarrely unbothered Westminster social services to arrive. In fact, such is his newfound competence that slapstick and other laughs are thin on the ground; Bingley even whips up an elaborate Christmas dinner without breaking a sweat.One complaint critics had about Man vs Bee was the product placement (Miele, Waitrose). This time, Cadbury’s Heroes are spotlighted on multiple occasions. I had to laugh when Bingley gives a pack to the young family squatting in the basement of the opulent block of flats (the less said about this ludicrously mawkish subplot the better), and informs them that the confectionery produced by Britain’s best-loved chocolate brand is “really nice, actually!”. The difference here is that these product placements are far from the most cynical thing about Man vs Baby, which trades on Cosy British Christmascore in the most trite way possible, and delivers its celebration of festive togetherness with cloying warmth.Still, we watch because – as is seemingly mandatory for all streamer shows – there is a dark mystery at the core of Man vs Baby. Namely, who is being tormented by the loss of their child? Or worse, who isn’t?In the event, any troubling subtext is swerved via a deus ex machina that is quite frankly bananas. I wish the same could be said about the action itself, which never escalates into the grand, high-wire, socially subversive physical comedy we expect from Atkinson. Instead, we just get a nauseatingly schmaltzy and nonsensical dose of Christmas cheer helmed by a kind-hearted, capable man. Mr Bean would never.Man vs Baby is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

Over the last three decades – beginning with her 1997 Booker winner, The God of Small Things, which catapulted her into celebrity – the writer’s works of fiction, nonfiction and essays have indeed been polarising; she has become one of the most prominent critics of the Indian government and Hindu nationalism.Last year, she was awarded thePEN Pinter prize, given to writers who cast an “unflinching, unswerving” gaze on the world. Earlier this year, she publishedMother Mary Comes To Me, an account of her relationship with her mother. The memoir has now been namedFoyles book of the year, and was also shortlisted for Waterstones book of the year. Here, Priya Bharadia takes readers through Roy’s essential reads.The entry pointRoy’s debut novel and instant bestseller,The God of Small Things, is the perfect introduction to the major political concerns of her work, from environmental damage, to caste, to the lingering trauma of colonial violence on a nation.The novel follows fraternal twins Rahel and Estha who reunite as adults after a tragic event separates them in childhood. Roy highlights the ways politics infiltrates love and intimacy: social prejudices and invisible taboos, which Roy refers to as the “Love Laws”, hold the characters back from fulfilling bonds.Before writing books, Roy trained as an architect in New Delhi, and hasspokenabout the parallels between the design of novels and buildings. Her careful attention to structure underpins the novel, as she teases our emotions to great – if painful – effect. The reasons behind this family’s bitterness remain hidden until the novel’s end. All we feel at first is the sting of the cruelty and, once the cause is revealed, only an ache at its senselessness.The personal oneIn her 2025 memoir Mother Mary Comes To Me, Roy documents her childhood and coming-of-age through her turbulent relationship with her mother, whom she describes as “my shelter and my storm”. Mary Roy, who died in 2022 at 88, was a force in her own right: she founded a renowned school in Kottayam, and won alandmark supreme court caseagainst her own family that affirmed equal inheritance rights for Syrian Christian women. The memoir is a sweeping account of Roy’s writing career, her observations of a changing India and the enduring complexities of the mother-daughter relationship.The one that deserves more attentionOriginally written as an introduction to BR Ambedkar’s fiery 1936 polemicAnnihilation of Caste, The Doctor and the Saint, published as a standalone essay in 2017, tells the story of the two titans of modern Indian history – Mahatma Gandhi andAmbedkar– and their rival visions for the country. The book is also a bold reappraisal of Gandhi, contending with the troubling and admirable aspects of his legacy. In just over 100 pages, Roy offers a searing takedown of the caste system in India: its history, how it operates and its enduring grip on the world’s largest democracy.The one worth persevering withPublished 20 years after her debut,The Ministry of Utmost Happinessmarked Roy’s highly anticipated return to the novel form. Here, Roy is concerned with how we find love and self-expression in times of political suppression. Moving between Delhi and Kashmir, Roy weaves the lives of a vivid cast of characters, each in different circumstances, all struggling towards liberation. It is more sprawling in structure (some patience is needed as we’re tugged between memories and the present) yet more urgent in tone than her first work of fiction.If you’re short on timeFor a quintessential but quick Roy essay, 2011’sWalking With the Comradesis a strong choice. For several weeks, Roy travels through the forests of Central India with a group of Naxalite indigenous rebels, after their battle with the Indian government to prevent the mining and extraction of their land. Between her accounts of the insurgents she met, Roy addresses the connections between environmental destruction, state violence and global capitalism. A fascinating piece of reportage.If you only read one, it should beHalf literary criticism, half polemic, Roy compiles her thoughts on the purpose of fiction in times of growing authoritarianism in her essay collection Azadi: Fascism, Fiction and Freedom in the Time of the Virus. The title comes from “Azad”, the Urdu word for “freedom”, which is now synonymous with the Kashmiri fight for self-determination.Particular standouts include Intimations of an Ending: The Rise and Rise of the Hindu Nation, an overview of the origins and growth of the Hindutva movement. In a Cambridge lecture, The Graveyard Talks Back: Fiction in the Time of Fake News, Roy builds on the image of thekabristan(the Muslim graveyard) to argue it is fiction alone that can accurately depict the lives of people who are suppressed and silenced: “Only fiction can tell about air that is so thick with fear and loss, with pride and mad courage, and with unimaginable cruelty.”Explore more on these topicsBooksWhere to start withArundhati RoyAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jayanti dreams of a woman offering her bracelets. Within days, her husband becomes sick and dies. Widowhood is not an option and Jayanti prepares for her ownsati. Determined to apply the “godly might of English justice” and uphold a law banning the practice, an English doctor and magistrate muscle in to stop her. In an 11th-hour volte face, Jayanti, desiring life over the afterlife, allows herself to be saved. Triumphant, the magistrate suggests she become his mistress, but instead she opts to be shipped off to Trinidad. The island, she’s told, is a place where the shame of her choice will be forgotten.Ever Since We Small, Celeste Mohammed’s second novel-in-stories, is a more cohesive work than Pleasantview, which won the Bocas prize for Caribbean literature in 2022. The opening chapter follows on from an academic introduction and Mohammed’s style is more reverent, less ballsy and humorous, than the warts-and-all portraits drawn in Pleasantview; but casting characters from the distant past often has that effect on novelists. The tone is appropriate, however; Mohammed here is the sober observer taking in the fate of women like Jayanti, who if they have choices at all, they are between bad and worse.The novel then jumps forward in time and place. By the second chapter, Jayanti is long dead and her descendant, 13-year-old Shiva Gopaul, is struggling through adolescence in the Trinidadian town of Bagatelle in 1973. This part of the story is narrated by “we”, the omniscientbois– guardian of the forest that hides ganja fields, bootlegging stills and Black Power camps. “Behold we arebois. We’ve always existed and we were once everywhere. Now, although carved from the southern continent and pushed back to the fringes of this island, still we see and listen and know.”Shiva, however, knows little. He only has his mother, That Town Woman, to love – “the only time he seems happy, eats well, and goes to school is when she’s here,”boisobserves. Lall, Shiva’s father, is bad, but he is often all Shiva has, as his mother frequently abandons him. The Gopauls are ethnically in the minority in Bagatelle, though Shiva’s mother is excluded not for her origins but for selling her body in town. One day Lall comes home with a bagged cage hiding the 12in-tall creature Godfrey, who briefly becomes Shiva’s “new secret friend”. With the arrival of Godfrey, the reader is being ordered to zip up their disbelief in a bag and throw it out to sea. When Shiva, in a panic, does exactly that to Godfrey, surprising evenbois, he is consumed by the fear of being cursed.Mohammed breaks the reader in; requires them to activate their imagination, to figure it out for themselvesThere is a lot to take in here, but the disorientation is deliberate. The gear changes, panned-out shots, zooming in on intricate details, shifting of points of view; the jump-cuts in time, the alternate points of narration, the twangs and blends of multiple creole tongues, some translated, some not – all this flies in the face of creative writing guidance, and yet it works. Mohammed breaks the reader in; requires them to activate their imagination, to figure it out for themselves. There’s an intelligence and pride in Mohammed’s voice that refuses to preach, prettify or patronise. Chapter by chapter she builds a multilayered history of an island and its people through the stories of the Gopaul family, who are splintered and then drawn back to each other like filings to a magnet.Ever Since We Small is deft, confident and big-hearted. Women curse, guide and heal, while love misleads, empowers and is satisfyingly capable of surmounting if not all, then at least a lot. A porous divide separates the real and the imagined. The novel’s world includes mystical figures such as Godfrey –saapins,diablessesandsoucouyants– but it also has women making a living rubbing clients’ stomachs on YouTube channels.As the book progresses, Mohammed’s formidable skills become increasingly apparent. The richness of creole permeates the palimpsest of cultures; the more Mohammed’s characters speak, the more insight one has into their thoughts, the more engaging, remarkable and downright funny so many of them are.Ever Since We Small by Celeste Mohammed is published by Jacaranda (£16.99).

It was Broche’s appetite for risk and a few hopeful Reddit posts that would create the game’s world of Lumiere and its struggle against the Paintress.“I was doing like eight hours per day after work and not sleeping at all for a few years,” Broche says. And while he would be joined by Tom Guillermin on the programming side and Francoise Meurisse as producer, the next few members of the nascent studio – Lorien Testard, lead composer and Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, lead writer – would only come to Clair Obscur by chance, via social media.View image in fullscreenConcept art of the Gommage, the once-a-year event where everyone of a certain age is killed.Photograph: Sandfall InteractiveTestard, a guitar teacher at the time who had never composed or published any music commerically, was discovered by Broche on SoundCloud. “We liked the same philosophy in games,” says Testard, who had been writing music inspired by his favourite titles. Similarly, Broche found his art director, Nicholas Maxson-Francombe, through personal works he posted on ArtStation. “We are all deeply engaged in our subject areas,” says Svedberg-Yen, who says that was what bonded the team together. “If you listen to Nicolas talk about art or Lorien talk about music, it’s just something that fills our minds and our days.”Svedberg-Yen, meanwhile, had come from the world of finance. She saw Broche’s Reddit post and auditioned to not only write but also to voice some of the prototype characters of Clair Obscur, namely Maelle and Lune. Despite a deep love for video games, storytelling and a childhood engrossed in novels, Svedberg-Yen had not considered it as a career option. “It never crossed my mind as possible. As the adage goes, for Asian parents [it’s] doctors, lawyers, or finance.”With a rudimentary team assembled under the banner of a new studio, Sandfall Interactive, they rebooted We Lost as Clair Obscur. It was there a world took shape and the gained its unmistakeableBelle Époque setting. “There’s a specificity,” Svedberg-Yens says. “I think that vision gets diluted when you’re trying to appeal to too many people.”View image in fullscreenThe team of Expedition 33: Lune (Kirsty Rider), Maelle (Jennifer English), Gustave (Charlie Cox) and Sciel (Shala Nyx).Photograph: Sandfall Interactive“It’s not meant to be French propaganda,” jokes Broche, about the game’s very Gallic aesthetic. The characters yellputainandmerde, there are berets and extremely scary mimes not only because it’s fun, he says, but born from a desire to make something “sincere and authentic”.Same goes for the story. Clair Obscur’s narrative drives the game forward and, as lead writer, Svedberg-Yen says it all has a “grounding and a basis in truth”.“We are all first-time writer and game developers in this sense … and so we kind of only know instinctively how write to what instinctively comes from within. And for a lot of the characters in those particular situations, to write them [you] have to really delve into the parts of my life that resonate with the situation that they’re in.”According to Svedberg-Yen, a conversation Broche had with his mother became core to the story’s emotional heft. When he asked her what would be the worst thing that could possibly happen, his mother responded saying it would be to lose her children. “The story deals with a lot of trauma,” she says, and that process of writing like that was often a scary process. “If people don’t like it, they don’t like you.” It was this ability to be vulnerable and open a communicative environment that Broche believes contributed to the success of the game.Despite an anxiety in the industry about the rise of AI in the development of video games, the team at Sandfall isn’t worried – especially Testard, who composed the game’s orchestral score based off the narrative beats of the game and the eponymous concept of clair obscur (or chiaroscuro), AKA the interplay of light and dark. “Music is the language of the soul,” he says. In fact, the evolution of technology like Unreal Engine 4 and the later 5, which the game runs on today, made a lot of the game possible. “More games will be 3D, because we have a lot of tools now,” says Broche, who describes the budget of his game to be on the “lower end of AA.”The team at Sandfall have been overwhelmed by their success. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, lauded the game as “shining example of French audacity”. None of them expected the experience of Clair Obscur to resonate so deeply with so many people. “I’ve gotten a lot of very heartfelt messages from players who have experienced loss in some way and who have felt that the story helped them deal with their grief or change their relationship with grief,” Svedberg-Yen says.“What’s really cool is I’ve gotten tons of messages from creatives, writers, aspiring writers who felt creatively drained or just felt like they wanted to quit, but then the game inspired them to start again and they started creating their own art again, to start writing.”Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

ComedianJayde Adams, as the landlady, welcomes us with the familiar jesting of her standup sets: “Alright, let’s get to know the room …” Eventually, the tale takes hold and time zips back to the 18th century, where bright-eyed, 13-year-old Jim Hawkins, reimagined here as a girl and played by Adryne Caulder-James, dreams of following in her late father’s footsteps and setting sail.View image in fullscreenFamiliar jesting … Jayde Adams in Treasure Island.Photograph: Johan PerssonLuckily for her, that’s the way the story goes. Jim assembles a motley crew of sailors to search for the treasure once hidden by notorious pirate Captain Flint. Unbeknownst to them, they are joined on the ship by Long John Silver (a cackling Colin Leggo) and his evil posse, desperate to steal the gold for themselves. This sets the stage for an adventure crammed full of double bluffs, backstabbing and swashbuckling sword fights.Cleary’s compositions, with lyrics by her and Brunger, are nothing short of a hoot. Performed by an athletic chorus of actor-musicians, the soulful, sea shanty-inspired melodies are rousing. Caulder-James has a voice like warm mist and her high, belted notes are the stuff of wonder. Elsewhere, Adams, playing multiple roles in her stage acting debut, becomes a quivering castaway, Benita Gunn, who has befriended the island’s singing puppet coconuts.They are just one of many inventive creative choices from director Paul Foster, whose production shrieks with life. A lifesize puppet parrot, controlled by Adams, squawks and flaps with glee. The set, designed by Tom Rogers, unfolds to reveal an enormous pirate ship, complete with lower and upper decks, cascading ropes and a ship’s wheel. We even get the chance to join in for a sing-song.At the centre of it all is a love for Bristol. With the narrative bookended by scenes in the city, and near-constant references for those in the know woven into the script, it feels like a proper local celebration. There are no Christmas carols here, but this adventure leaves you with a warm, seasonal glow.AtBristol Old Vicuntil 10 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreChristmas showsBristol Old VicJayde AdamsMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It cannot throw a pot, blow glass, beat metal, weave bamboo or turn wood. Perhaps, when it has assumed absolute control of human consciousness and the machinery of mass production, it will be able to. But for now, throwing a vessel and weighing its heft in your hand, or carving a tray and sizing up its form with your eye are still the preserve of skilled craftspeople, using techniques their distant ancestors would recognise.View image in fullscreenLaconic simplicity … Hyakkō: 100+ Makers from Japan.Photograph: Jeremie Souteyrat/Japan House LondonOn show at London’sJapanHouse is the work of more than 100 pairs of eyes and hands, constituting an overwhelming profusion of human creativity, corralled into an exhibition of laconic simplicity. About 2,000 objects – bowls, trays, cups, metalwork, glassware and some perplexing bamboo cocoons – are grouped according to their makers on long, softly lit display tables. At first glance, you might think you have stumbled into an especially refined John Lewis homeware department, but then you notice the delicate black and red lacquer work, the gleaming gold on the inside of a perfectly shaped sake cup, the intricacy of the bamboo and some eccentrically shaped vessels, like alien seedpods, that look like ceramics but turn out be a kind of petrified leather.Craftsmanship that gives practical and beautiful shape to raw materials has been part of Japanese life for centuries. Yet historically, the products of formal crafts such asurushi(lacquerware) and metalwork were conceived as costly artefacts to be admired, well out of reach of ordinary people. It wasn’t until the 1920s that the folk craft movement, known asmingei,refocused attention on the unassuming beauty of hand-crafted utilitarian objects.Today, despite the prevalence of industrial production, artisans across Japan continue to create everyday utensils and vessels, employing traditional methods that respond to the particular qualities of their chosen material. No two crafts are the same, and each artisan brings a unique imprimatur to the process of creation.In a two-year odyssey, the exhibition’s curator, Nagata Takahiro, travelled the length of Japan, seeking out craftspeople hunkered in country sheds and city flats, shaping clay, beating metal and working wood, quietly getting on with creating. The aim was to get a sense of the numbers and experiences of people involved in sustaining traditional Japanese crafts. It turned out to be an extensive and thriving network, with artisans using social media to showcase their wares and connect with buyers, galleries, craft fairs and other makers.View image in fullscreenBeauty and strength … works on display in Hyakkō: 100+ Makers from Japan.Photograph: Jeremie Souteyrat/Japan House LondonShinichi Moriguchi spends his time crafting chestnut wood trays known aswagatabon,traditional utensils dating from the Edo period with distinctive chisel marks inscribed vertically across the wood grain. Chestnut wood is especially resistant to water and decay and the chiselled lines resemble rippling waves, conjuring a sense of beauty and strength. No two surfaces are alike. Moriguchi lives in Kyoto and runs an atelier in the surrounding mountains, teaching students the craft ofwagataboncarving. “It only requires simple tools – a wooden mallet and chisels – so anyone can learn,” he says.Before becoming a metalsmith,Yumi Nakamuraworked in interior design, so her approach to craft is inflected by a strong awareness of space and how objects appear in settings. Her kettles and tea vessels are exquisitely sculptural, with slim, exaggeratedly curved handles. Although the process of hammering and shaping sheets of metal can be arduous, she marvels at how objects can be drawn out from inanimate matter. “Unlike ceramics or glass, metalwork lets you keep touching the form,” she says. “You can keep hammering for ever, so deciding when to stop is crucial.” Reflecting different strengths and physiques, the hammer marks also embody the maker’s character.View image in fullscreenCherishable … Hyakkō: 100+ Makers from Japan.Photograph: Jeremie Souteyrat/Japan House LondonAmplifying the now cliched notion ofwabi-sabi, which has come to be routinely applied to anything involving weathered natural materials, the exhibition featuresa glossary of termsthat crystallise singularly Japanese concepts, such asanbai,meaning “balance” or “adjustment”. Originally it was used to describe the seasoning of food, but here it relates to how the quality of an object hinges on its form and colour.Shibui(literally “bitter”) means subtly elegant, whileibitsusarefers to “irregularity”, which is to be cherished as evidence of the human hand, imparting an expressive quality that cannot (yet) be reproduced by machines.Short films document some of the craftspeople at work, showing how base materials are effortfully transformed into elegant artefacts. As with the potter’s wheel television intervals of yore, there is a seductively ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) quality to watching how a bowl or spoon is made, but the films also convey a wider sense of the artisans’ lives, their daily routines and their locales, since the nature of place also shapes approaches to design.Specialising in porcelain, ceramic artists Yamamoto Ryōhei and Hirakura Yuki share a home and studio in Arita, in western Kyushu, where porcelain was first produced in Japan more than 400 years ago. Near their home is the site of the oldest kiln in Arita. Discarded pottery shards are strewn around the ground, yet despite their age, the fragments retain a surprising freshness. The couple began to research and replicate historic pieces, refining their making techniques and gradually developing a style that became their own. “The human eye is always searching for something,” says Ryōhei. “When you’re unsure whether you’re seeing a design or not, your imagination starts working.”What emerges is how intrinsically and intimately craft is part of human existence, passed down through generations, changing yet somehow unchanged. Programming director Simon Wright quotes a line from the 13th-century Japanese writer Kamo no Chōmei: “The flow of the river never ceases, and yet the water is never the same.”Hyakkō: 100+ Makers from Japan, Japan House, London, until 10 MayExplore more on these topicsCultureJapanCraftArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

The first was the centrepiece of her earliest exhibition as a solo artist in 1989,where she debuted her groundbreaking, technically complex photomontages in which dizzying patterns are woven from repeating imagery. It’s a self-portrait where she peers uncertainly from a mandala made from tiny posturing male nudes, “pressed in by men” as Kulik puts it.The second was made nearly a decade later in 1997, the year that that artistic leap into the unknown was given the ultimate public affirmation and she represented her country at the Venice Biennale. This time she’s an assertive queen, posed like Elizabeth I, resplendent with a ruff, wide-skirted and sleeved gown, embellished with decorative patterns of those naked men.The first big English-language monograph of Kulik’s unique output traces this fascinating journey, as she confronts the forces that oppress and the possibility of emancipation – politically, artistically, and in her own life, too. She was 42 when she started on her path to becoming one of Poland’s most significant artists. It was the late 1980s and a time of new beginnings: communism was collapsing and her relationship with the creative and romantic partner she’d been with since art school was over. Having grown frustrated as part of a collective where her chief role was to document the activities of others, she found herself at a turning point. “I needed to find a reason to make art again,” she recalls. “I was in a bad way psychologically.” Yet gradually she began to feel “free to do things without discussion. I started to explore myself, my roots in my family and to create archives of my own.”Raised in a military barracks, Kulik had grown up between two worlds: the domestic life of her seamstress mother, and the military, ideologically on-message outdoor realm of her soldier father. “The collision of these factors in my work is crucial, the balance between soft and sharp elements,” she says. She went back to the beginnings of her art education too, first sketching poses from art history, then photographing them. Upending the classic gender split between male artist and female muse, she worked with a young artist-model, Zbigniew Libera, amassing an archive of more than 700 nude images of him in a few years. Using a pioneering technique, she began creating photomontages, with multiple exposures of her negatives on photosensitive paper so that a single work can hold hundreds of images.“At first I didn’t plan to use them in such complex compositions,” she recalls. “I started to compare [the art historical] gestures with those of Mao or Lenin. It was a straightforward path from there.” In her work, this language of patriarchal might – especially the political or religious kind – is shown as a repeating pattern that seems to coat everything, like the patterned carpets that the artist’s father used to cover the floor, walls and tables in his Warsaw home.Yet the posturing of history’s power-players is literally stripped bare, with a tiny naked man who strikes a pose again and again, be it the spear-bearing Greek hero, a dead Christ, a fallen angel from William Blake or a Soviet revolutionary staring towards a bright communist tomorrow. Against this male mass she pits herself, an individual woman holding her own at the centre. “I’d felt like I was hammered like a nail my whole life,” she says. “I took symbolic weapons and tried to react to that.”Body politics: five works by Zofia KulikView image in fullscreenZofia Kulik’s Self Portrait With a Flag (I), 1989.Photograph: © Zofia KulikSelf Portrait With a Flag (I), 1989This landmark work marks the first time when, in her early 40s, Kulik began experimenting with self-portraiture, making a conscious break with her previous collaborative work. The red flag refers back both to the collapse of communism and that earlier period in her own life, when it had been used in a group performance.The Splendour of Myself (IV), 2005, main imageThis is one of a series of works begun in 1997 that riff on portraits of Elizabeth I. Kulik’s interest in paintings of the Tudor monarch was sharpened when she realised that they revealed the tacit influence of Catholic Spain through English court fashions.View image in fullscreenDetail from Zofia Kulik’s All the Missiles Are One Missile, 1993.Photograph: © Zofia KulikAll the Missiles Are One Missile, 1993This is a detail from a huge patterned photomontage that Kulik exhibited at the Venice Biennale in 1997.

Joe Tracini’s script is set in the seaside town of Crabbington Sands where a pastel-dressed ensemble make merry with Aimee Leigh’s breezy choreography. Cinderella’s sisters, gruesome twosome Lou and Lav (cue toilet-flush effect), could have stepped out of an outrageously saucy postcard. Designer Kirsteen Wythe gifts them lurid costumes best seen with UV protection. They include a beach ball-shaped dress, a bucket-and-spade hat, fairground-ride frocks and wigs seemingly woven with fishing rope.Cinderella’s parents ran a local hotel that has been shuttered since she lost them, and she yearns for new adventures, a longing captured in an opening rendition of Natasha Bedingfield’s Unwritten. In the lead role, Georgia May Foote brings a big sister vibe to her crowdwork with the young audience that also underlines how Cinders sees the hopelessly devoted Buttons (Tracini) as a brother. But she is written to be a bit insipid, and there is little spark to her romance with a wannabe rock-star prince (Danny Hatchard, poised between buffoon and decent bloke).View image in fullscreenStraight from the end of the pier … Joe Tracini (centre) in Cinderella.Photograph: Richard Jarmy/Dinky PixThis is a panto that proves as trad as turkey with all the trimmings. There’s plenty to enjoy, principally Owen Evans and Kenny Moore as the wicked sisters (with no stepmother in sight), but also some jokes so bad they’re brilliant, a “Shoe Must Go On” gameshow featuring the fabled slipper and a chorus of monks singing Ring My Bell. Tracini is a treat in that last routine, left dangling from a rope as an “air friar”. When he dashes through the stalls he is mobbed by the kids.Hannah-Jane Fox gives us a pink-haired fairy godmother who is losing her magic touch, so that her couplets fail to find a closing rhyme. It’s a nice conceit in a script that is sparing with that panto chestnut of adults dabbling in youthful slang (“so cringe” mutters an unimpressed schoolchild in the row behind on one of those occasions).View image in fullscreenMore please … Jeevan Braich (left) and Danny Hatchard in Cinderella.Photograph: Richard Jarmy/Dinky PixIf I had one wish from that fairy godmother it would be for Jeevan Braich’s Dandini to get more of the spotlight. Braich, a breakout sensation fromStarlight Expresswho has a wonderfully rich voice, is given a big number after the interval that instantly raises the temperature. The plot peters out in that second half, which is in need of a big climactic set piece and hastily wraps up the story like a last-minute Christmas present. But Andrew Lynford’s bright, boisterous and warmly performed production leaves you not just with sore eyes and ringing ears, but a grin too.AtNorwich Theatre Royaluntil 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsPanto seasonTheatreComedy (Stage)Christmas showsComedy (Culture)ChristmasNorwichreviewsShareReuse this content"

They werejoined on Wednesday by Iceland, where the board of the national broadcaster RÚV voted not to participate.In their statement, Nemo said: “This is not about individuals or artists. The contest was repeatedly used to soften the image of a state accused of severe wrongdoing, all while the EBU insisted Eurovision is ‘non-political’.

That’s why I’ve decided that I’m sending my trophy back to the EBU headquarters in Geneva.”The Israeli broadcaster Kan has welcomed the decision to keep Israel in the contest, rejecting allegations of political interference.

Overtourism has became a major concern for the city’s residents, however.A two-and-a-half-hour drive south of Amsterdam, Eindhoven is the fifth largest city in theNetherlandsby population. It is also a major technology hub and has a long-running association with the consumer electronics company Philips.“The Rijksmuseum in Eindhoven will be a valuable addition to the cultural landscape of Brabant and beyond,” said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, a former Dutch finance minister now serving as Eindhoven’s mayor. “This museum is set to become a place where everyone can enjoy a unique blend of history and creativity.”The Rijksmuseum is the latest European museum to open a near or far-flung outpost. Paris’s Louvre opened an offshoot in Lens, a former mining town in northern France, in 2012 and a further branch in Abu Dhabi in 2017.London’s V&A, which specialises in the applied arts, is scheduled to open a branch in the city’s former Olympic park in April.Artlovers can already visit its East Storehouse, which opened in the park in May.Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsMuseumsPaintingArt (Education)RembrandtEuropeArt (Art and design)newsShareReuse this content"

Both will play the same characters as in the original set of films – Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen and Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark – with the Hollywood Reporter suggesting they will “likely appear in a flash-forward”. At the close of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 (released in 2015), Everdeen and Mellark are married with children.Sunrise on the Reaping is adapted from the 2025 novel by Suzanne Collins, and will be the second prequel film in the series after The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, released in 2023, which was also based on a novel by Collins. Like all but one of the Hunger Games films so far, it is directed by Francis Lawrence.The events of Sunrise on the Reaping take place 24 years before The Hunger Games (and 40 years after The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes); they centre on Haymitch Abernathy, a tribute for the 50th Hunger Games, who is later to become Everdeen’s mentor (as played by Woody Harrelson in the original films). The film also stars Jesse Plemons as Plutarch Heavensbee (previously played by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Ralph Fiennes as a younger version of President Snow (originally played by Donald Sutherland).Lawrence is now appearing in Die My Love, directed by Lynne Ramsay, for which she has been nominated for a Golden Globe for best female actor. Hutcherson is in Five Nights at Freddy’s 2, which opened at No 1 at the North American box office on 5 December.Filming on Sunrise on the Reaping began in summer 2025and producer Nina Jacobsonsaid on social mediathat it had “wrapped” in November. It is due for release in November 2026.Explore more on these topicsFilmJennifer LawrenceThe Hunger GamesFilm adaptationsSuzanne CollinsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the track was never officially released, after numerous attempts to get the sample cleared were denied.“I got a call from Mick Jagger and he said he’d heard it and he liked the mix,” Fatboy Slim, AKA Norman Cook,told the BBC. “But his management was just like, ‘No, not even negotiable’. We’ve had a pretty flat ‘no’ for 20 years. I think we asked four times, and I wouldn’t have dared to ask them again.”But the Stones eventually relented, allowing Cook to build the track anew from the original parts of Satisfaction: the stems for the track were delivered to him in an armoured van. It will be released with a music video directed by Tom Furse of goth band the Horrors, who used AI to enhance archive photos of the Stones.The Stones’ decision to approve the sample has echoes of how,in 2019, the band relinquished their rights regarding the Verve’s hit Bitter Sweet Symphony.The song used four seconds of an orchestral version of the Stones song The Last Time for its central string motif, which the Stones’ publishing company disputed the use of, and after an out of court settlement the song’s royalties passed to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards as part of a shared songwriting credit.But after what Ashcroft called “a kind and magnanimous gesture from Mick and Keith”, he was granted all future royalties to the song.The Rolling Stones have maintained a relatively low profile following the release of their comeback album Hackney Diamonds in 2023 and a tour in 2024, though guitarist Ronnie Wood said in May that the band were still planning another album.Cook, 62, remains highly active, having just hosted his All Back to Minehead weekend festival featuring sets from artists including actor Simon Pegg, and planning three large outdoor concerts on Brighton beach in July 2026. He has also recently published a book, It Ain’t Over ’Til the Fatboy Sings.Explore more on these topicsFatboy SlimDance musicThe Rolling StonesnewsShareReuse this content"

It was only a small one, with one blade, scissors, tweezers, a nail file and a light.

One of my lodgers – a teaching colleague – gave me a Swiss army knife as a leaving present. It has resided and been used in a myriad of other countries during my travels: increasingly, it has been used as a corkscrew rather than a knife, but has recently retired to the UK.Mark ExtonHome comfortsView image in fullscreenWool tartan rug£39.95 at House of BruarWe received a checked tartan wool travel rug as a wedding present 41 years ago.

I came up with the idea of buying her a first-edition Agatha Christie. When it arrived, it was small, tatty and not looking like the best idea I’d ever had! However, we wrapped and sent it to her in the post – and her response was the best I’ve ever had from a recipient of a present: “How could you buy me something I never knew I wanted so badly?!” It was the best £400 ever spent!Lynwen JonesRetro techView image in fullscreenPanasonic portable speaker and CD player£129.99 at Panasonic£129.99 at AmazonMy husband was given a radio cassette player for his 21st.

We got together in November 1991, and at new year we went to Whitby – where he found it and gave it to me while sitting by the bay watching the fireworks be set off by the boats. I still have it in my bedside table drawer. We live in Vancouver, Canada, now so it’s a well-travelled fossil!JaneHard-working kitchen appliancesView image in fullscreenKenwood Chefette stand and hand mixer£74.99 at John Lewis£74.99 at AmazonWe were given a Kenwood Chefette food mixer as a wedding present.

I used it all the time to mix, mince, blend, whisk or knead stuff. Just before my 50th birthday, the motor died, mid-cake mix. It was going to be my son’s birthday cake. I had to finish it by hand and it took me ages. On my 50th birthday I unwrapped my presents to find I had got a new one.

Bought for me by an uncle as my wedding present in 1988. It’s had a couple of “refurbs” over the years – it’s great that it’s possible to get the spares. It’s been used and abused DIYing three houses, plus away gigs at my son’s house in recent years. It’s been a go-to “mate” for multiple car services, bicycle rebuilds/services, painting table, saw horse … It’s also a treasured link back to a wonderful uncle, long since passed on.JohnStylish scissorsView image in fullscreenFiskars scissors£19.99 at Robert Dyas£19.95 at AmazonBack in the early 80s, we were bewildered by our father’s choice of Christmas stocking gift. My sister and I each received two pairs of scissors, the handles bright orange. Barely a day goes by when I’m not opening the kitchen drawer to pull one or the other out. The one with the straight edge is best for cutting paper, the other with a textured, shaped edge is just right for snipping bacon or chicken. They are classic and stylish.JaneDouble-use laundry basketsView image in fullscreenAddis laundry basket£12 at Argos£12 at AmazonOur longest-lasting gift was a humble laundry basket made by Addis given to us as a wedding present. It doesn’t look much, but it’s so tough and durable, and has dealt with our washing for 45 years. When our kids were small, they used to climb into the basket and their dad would swing them from side to side in the air. Good for the biceps! I love our Addis baskets!Lesley TurnerClassic carView image in fullscreenVertbaudet FSC-wood ride-on car£118.11 at VertbaudetBy far the best value gift for our children has been a little wooden (indoor) ride-on car for our son’s first birthday. He is now eight, and his little brother almost five, and they still play with it on a daily basis. It has been a fire engine, Formula E car, horse-drawn carriage and countless more iterations. It’s needed cleaning a few times, but otherwise no maintenance/repair, so it will be passed down to their children.ElisabethA well-made T-shirtView image in fullscreenWomen’s Breton striped shirt£68 at Armor Lux£41.12 at AmazonView image in fullscreenMen’s Breton striped shirt£70 at John Lewis£35.20 at AmazonIn 1995, I gave my new girlfriend a striped sailor T-shirt from the French brand Armor-Lux.

It looks a little worn, but it must have had many more than 1,000 washes. The product is still available and made in Brittany. Beat that value, fast fashion.Mark KaminskiTimeless toysView image in fullscreenBrio classic railwayset£31.99 at Beanie Games£45 at John LewisMy sons were given a Brio train set when they were toddlers and spent hours playing with it (they are now 36 and 37).

As a teenager in the 1980s, I started buying pieces from Field Row Pottery in Worthing (now closed) for family. You can always find a local potter making things you like. You can buy practical dishes; a salt-pig for the cook or foodie; vases or bowls for someone you know better; a mug for a colleague. Pottery lasts, good pieces are timeless and every home is better for having some.Dan ThompsonFor ever gifts include several wooden bowls and ceramic vessels beautifully crafted by family members, which stand in pride of place alongside handmade objects from our travels.

I use it to cook for my third, and definitely last, husband.Pam SmallwoodI still have a small Le Creuset saucepan that my mother gave me when I went to uni 47 years ago. I also have multiple pieces I received as wedding gifts 35 years ago, all still in use. They are amazing.EugenieVersatile baby toysView image in fullscreenSilicone stacking cups£13.99 at EtsyMinifolk silicone stacking cups are an excellent baby gift.

Plus, a new digital cookbook for a good causeSign up here for our weekly food newsletter, FeastFelicity CloakeThu 11 Dec 2025 07.30 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 07.31 ESTShareWithout wanting to sound tediously Scrooge-like, the German-style markets that have become seasonal fixtures in many British cities over the last few decades never make me feel particularly festive. What’s remotely Christmassy – or German – about Dubai-chocolate churros and Korean fried chicken, I grumble as I drag the dog (who enjoys all such things) around their perimeters.Hamburg’s markets, however, which I was myself dragged around last weekend, are averydifferent story. For a start, the city has many of them, mainly fairly small – and some, such as the “erotic Christmas market” in St Pauli, with a particular theme. What they all have in common is the range of food and drink on offer … though let’s gloss hurriedly over the phallic gingerbread shapes on sale at St Pauli in favour of the eye-opening range of glühwein (white, rosé, kirsch-spiked, blueberry-flavoured), which was far more appealing.Though I am familiar with it as a concept –mulled winewith an umlaut in it – from now on I shall insist that everyone refers toHenry Dimbleby’s white versionas Weißer Glühwein in tribute (if you’d prefer to delegate the mulling,Joanne Gould tips Waitrose’s mulled roséas one of her festive favourites). I also enjoyed eierlikör, which is essentiallyeggnog; if you, like me, enjoy getting drunk on custard, it’s worth making your own – and my recipe can be given a more Germanic feeling by using brandy and white rum instead of the whisky, and replacing the nutmeg with vanilla extract. (You probably don’t need instructions on how to make a boozy hot chocolate, buthere’s some guidance from Tony Naylor anyway.)View image in fullscreenVery giftable … Meera Sodha’s zimtsterne.Photograph: Robert Billington/The GuardianThe food in Hamburg quickly became as familiar as the drinks menu. Naturally, there werebratwurstgrilled over an open flame, often accompanied by an avalanche ofthe country’s beloved curry sauce, and sides of salmon (Hamburg is very much a fish-eating city), but also käsespätzle (Yotam Ottolenghi has a deliciously cheesy-looking recipe) and the wonderfully-namedkartoffelpufferpotato pancakes, plus more recent innovations such ashandbrot, or dough balls stuffed with various fillings that almost always involve cheese – and, more weirdly, crumble. (You can’t get away from crumble at the moment, but none of it looks as good as the school stuff to me.)Although most people seemed to be there to eat, drink and be merry, the point of these markets is ostensibly shopping and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the food stalls were my favourites. Christmas cookies are a big deal in Germany;Luisa Weiss has some lovely ideas, while Anna Jones put her own stamp onsome citrus, honey and almond lebkuchen; and just last weekend Meera Sodha sharedher friend’s grandma’s recipe for zimtsterne. I brought a selection home, along with some solid, marzipan-stuffed stollen bites, which my stodgy northern heart will always prefer to panettone. Stollen is also considerably easier to make at home:Dan Lepard has a good quick recipeinvolving sour cherries and quark, though, if you’re not in a hurry (and this is not a time of year for hurrying), you might preferFalko Burkert’s more traditional take.Lastly, if anyone has advice on recreating the huge chocolaterumkugelnI saw but didn’t have time to try, please send it my way. In the meantime, Frohe Weihnachten; wishing you all a delicious and joyous December, however you’re spending it.My week in foodView image in fullscreenShare the love … digital cookbook All Our Kitchens is raising funds for Gaza charities and includes recipes such as rummaniyeh by Izzeldin Bukhari, left.Composite: All Our KitchensA time for giving| Christmas, like so many religious festivals, is a time for giving – whether or not you celebrate, you might wish to share the love where it’s really needed by investing £10 in All Our Kitchens, a new digital cookbook featuring recipes from the likes of Sami Tamimi, Noor Murad and Andi Oliver, along with other professional and home cooks from across the UK, Ireland and Palestine. All profits go directly to Gaza Soup Kitchen and the Zaynab Project, two charities working to feed people on the ground in Gaza, where the situation is still desperate.Download it here.Mmmmmmarzipan|I was disappointed not to see more marzipan on offer in Hamburg (it’s a speciality of nearby Lübeck). Happily, however, the latest Kitchen Projects newsletter on Substack is a deep dive intoall things almond paste-related from Camilla Wynne, including a recipe that sounds far superior to versions I’ve made, as well as many inspirational pictures of cute marzipan potatoes and devilled eggs and doughnuts.Skaus or scouse?|Hamburg is famous less for its hamburgers than the dishes that reflect and celebrate its maritime heritage. Fish sandwiches are the fast food of choice at all times of day and night, while comfort food is served in the form oflabskaus, a salt beef and potato hash turned unnervingly red with beetroot juice and served with a fried egg, pickles and the inevitable rollmop. If the name sounds familiar, it is because this sailors’ favourite is also enjoyed in stew form in Liverpool, where it’s known as lobscouse, commonly shortened to scouse.My recipedoes not, however, include herring.Saluti!|Raising a glass to chefGiancarlo Caldesi, whose contribution to Italian cuisine and culinary culture in the UK was recognised by the Italian government with the title “Ufficiale”, which is roughly equivalent to a British knighthood.

Who should reel it in?Get a disagreement settled or become a YBTJ jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonThu 11 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 10.44 ESTShareThe prosecution: BethSometimes she films me while I’m eating. I’ll see myself on her Instagram – it’s like a jumpscareMy best friend of 10 years, Marielle, calls herself the “content queen”. It’s fun for a bit, but it weighs on our friendship.She is an extrovert and feels the need to record everything all the time. When we eat out, she says, “The camera eats first,” and takes photos with the flash on, which makes me cringe. I don’t like it when other people see her posing or filming herself eating – I get secondhand embarrassment. It also frustrates me because the food gets cold.She isn’t exactly an influencer yet, but Marielle is trying to be. She makes vlogs about living in our city, a day in her life, and her work as a stylist. Her content is good, I’ll give her that, but I don’t want to be dragged into it. Sometimes she films me while I’m eating, or just accompanying her. I’ll see myself on herInstagramlater, and it comes like a jumpscare: I’ll have no makeup on, an awkward face or be captured mid-bite. It’s uncomfortable.I feel like I’ve become her unpaid videographer. She could easily hire someone if she wanted professional shotsMarielle also expects me to film her at inconvenient times. Sometimes I’ll be talking to someone else, or we’ll just be hanging out in the street. I feel like our friendship has turned into me being her unpaid videographer. She could easily hire someone if she wanted professional shots. When I brought up my discomfort about this arrangement, she brushed it off. She’s taken me to a couple of brand events, which was nice, but that doesn’t make up for all the time and effort I spend helping her make content.I’m grateful that Marielle has helped me with my career in design, but I don’t want our friendship to become just a ledger of favours. I don’t feel she’s fake or inauthentic, but sometimes I feel that if the camera is out, we will start performing in a way that makes us look good for her vlog.She will say, “OK, look happy!” and film me laughing with someone. It’s so silly. I need her to understand that our 10-year friendship still has boundaries. I love spending time with her, but I also want to enjoy it without being filmed, edited, or posted for an audience. I’m not a prop for her Instagram.The defence: MarielleI want Beth to seethat the contentwe make together can get usa foot in the doorI love shooting content. It’s not just a hobby; it’s part of who I am. Creating videos and sharing my life online allows me to express myself and connect with people in new ways.I don’t see myself as a full influencer yet, but it’s smart to make money from your passions. I admire people on TikTok who pull off that style of casual, DIY film-making.Creating content is my version of living actively: noticing the details, sharing them with an audience that appreciates the art behind it. I never intend to make Beth uncomfortable. Taking her to industry events was my way of sharing opportunities, giving her a chance to experience behind-the-scenes moments that could help her career in design too. That’s not blackmail, it’s just being realistic.I’d still take her to these events even if she didn’t help me, but I want her to see what the content we make together can get us: a foot in the door. I know not everyone enjoys being filmed, but sometimes spontaneity is what makes content authentic. Being recorded occasionally is part and parcel of being my friend. I would delete anything she asked, but she has never asked yet.This isn’t about control, it’s about sharing my world while still respecting hersI don’t expect anyone to be my personal videographer, but friends help each other in small ways. I thought filming a clip here or there would be fun for Beth. Creativity thrives in collaboration, and having Beth around makes projects lively and enjoyable. I never force her to participate in anything, and I’d never deliberately embarrass her. But filming together occasionally is part of how I document our shared experiences.I value Beth’s friendship deeply and don’t want content creation to come between us. I’m willing to compromise: like asking before filming, and avoiding shots that might make her uncomfortable.This isn’t about control, it’s about sharing my world while still respecting hers. Obviously making content is not a replacement for genuine friendship: it’s just part of how I live my life and I want her to be involved in a way that’s enjoyable for both of us.The jury of Guardian readersShould Marielle stop filming herself and Beth when they are out together?There’s nothing more excruciating than having a friend film you. I get that it’s Marielle’s job, but I don’t make friends come to my work. Maybe she can find influencer friends to create content with. With the dark, looming future of AI, human connections are the only thing we have – don’t waste them!Liberty, 25If you’re doing something professionally, you can’t ask your friends for help every time, even if they have done it before. If Marielle loves shooting, that doesn’t mean everyone around her is content. She needs to respect Beth’s privacy.Ankit, 26Marielle might love making content and showing off her life publicly, but it’s not for everyone. It’s nice she has helped Beth’s career, but she needs to hear what Beth wants.Emma, 27It sounds like you care about each other, so hold on to that and make sure it’s the priority in your friendship. Create some real memories, where genuine feelings are stored, not digital scrapbooks. Even celebrities who seem to share their worlds actually have more privacy than it seems.Sarah, 53Marielle appears to be neither present nor authentic when she’s with Beth – she’s working. Both seem confused as to what’s reasonable. The answer lies not in trying to change one another, but in each setting clear boundaries around what feels acceptable to them and seeing if there is an acceptable compromise.Barbara, 71Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: is Marielle over-exposing their friendship?The poll closes on Wednesday 17 December at 9am GMTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherWhitney should stop trying to find a partner for her friend Haile97%of you said yes –Whitney is guilty3%of you said no –Whitney is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsInstagramYou be the judgeVideo artfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As I said at this time last year, don’t waste your time and money on fancy-dan wine kit and gadgets: I am speaking for myself here, of course, but a lot of it will ultimately find its way to a kitchen drawer, never to be seen again. I am always running out of corkscrews, however, andthe one from St Johnis iconic and monochrome, or maybe something sleek and silver fromFortnum & Mason, perhaps?When it comes to gifting wine, it’s a good idea to draw on the crowdpleasers to fit that specific bill. For sparkling wines, crémant is a cost-effective option if you want the delight of fizz but don’t have deep pockets. Champagne, even in a supermarket, teeters around the £50-mark these days, though there are some cute gift boxes out there to warrant the expense:Piper Heidsieck’s fire hydrant caseis fun and camp, and there’s no better excuse than Christmas to break outVeuve Cliquot’s puffy bottle holder.But if buying booze feels like too much of a minefield (drinks aficionados can be exacting types), some good stemware is a nice option, because it’s thoughtful, good-quality stuff can be had at every price point, and it’s a gift that will allow a wine lover to get the most out of wine they already have. To that end, I really,reallyrecommendthe stemware from Zara Home: most ready-to-buy fashion homeware sections are all thick glass and style over ergonomics, but much of Zara’s range is chic and purpose-built. ItsBohemia crystal plain glass, for instance, made up my first home set, and is a snip at £4.99 each. With a wide base to swirl your wine and a narrow rim to collect the aromas, it’s a great vessel to enjoy your wine in. You’ll also find matching tumblers and flutes online.At the crazier end, Maison Balzac makes some truly zany stemware designed with your favourite beverages in mind: blown-glass chillies, for instance, adornone short tumbler, surely created to house a spicy margarita. And it’s spenny, yes, but theoriginal universal wine glassfrom Richard Brendon’s collaboration with Jancis Robinson is an excellent luxury option, too. Emphasis on the luxury here – they’re £96 for two – but if anyone is looking to get me anything for Christmas, my housemate has managed to smash two. I’ll also accept gift cards.Four drinks gifts I’d be happy to getPiper Heidsieck Code Rouge Gift Set£65.99 Selfridges, 12%.So silly and brilliant: Piper’s classic cuvée in a container shaped like a fire extinguisher.Whitebox Cocktails Spicy Marg Cracker£12 Whitebox Cocktails, 20.5%.

Or that it took longer for it to be developed than it took for the Wright brothers to invent the aeroplane? You probably know that pockets have become asymbol of gender privilege– but were you aware that in the 18th century, women’s pockets were big enough to hold tools for writing, a small diary and a snack for later? Perhaps most surprising is that layering, which has made Uniqlo one of the biggest brands in the world, was in effect invented in the 1940s by a man named Georges Doriot, who was also famous for inventing venture capital.All these nuggets and more are included in Articles of Interest, a podcast by 34-year-old Avery Trufelman. Listeners tune in for the smarts but also her disarming sense of fun. Not to mention her low, husky voice, which seems made for podcasting. “I don’t take care of it, if that’s what you’re asking,” she says over video call from her apartment in New York.View image in fullscreenGideon Sundback, the Swedish-American electrical engineer known for inventing the modern zipper.Photograph: AlamyNow in its seventh series, Articles of Interest launched in 2018 and explores the history, politics and power of fashion, treating it – unlike many fashion podcasts – as culture. The detail about layering comes courtesy of the latest, longform season, titled Gear, in which Trufelman unpicks the links between American military clothing and civilian outdoor wear, right up to the Arcteryxgorpcore beaniesworn by Americans queueing for cortados.Originally a spin-off from another podcast Trufelman worked on, the much-loved design podcast 99% Invisible, she started Articles of Interest because: “Over the years, as we talked about design, I was like: we’re kind of leaving something out. We’re not talking about clothes.” At first she felt a lot of pressure to cover “all the cool stuff”. “They talked about architecture and they talked about concrete and they talked about queue theory … and I was like ‘I’m down with this’.” But she wondered “‘why don’t we apply the same logic to clothes?’ for some reason, it’s totally different. It becomes like Zoolander when you talk about fashion.”Trufelman’s smart, animated approach treats a world often seen as elitist, or simply uninteresting and shallow, with heft and historicism. Episodes have been downloaded more than 10m times. It has been voted among the 100 best podcasts of all time by Time magazine, and consistently ranks in the New Yorker’s annual of the best podcasts. Trufelman herself has been called a fashion anthropologist.View image in fullscreen‘American civilians and the military have never been more intertwined than we are now, in our clothing’ … A Louis Vuitton bag seen at Paris fashion week, January 2025.Photograph: Edward Berthelot/Getty ImagesGear is a rich and unexpected listen, and one that exposes the uncomfortable connections between civilian clothing and the bloody business of war. “Almost every garment I have reported on has some connection to war,” says Trufelman. And, in the US at least, it’s not just a matter of aesthetics: “The US military is involved in a very practical way in the creation of clothing itself.” From sweat-wicking outer shells to the abundance of camo, “American civilians and the military have never been more intertwined than we are now, in our clothing.”She got the idea for Gear after her first multiparter, American Ivy, a deep dive into the world of preppy fashion that “got me thinking about the other pillars of American clothes”. It examines the reasons for US army uniforms shifting from blue to khaki, posits a theory about the increased visibility of special forces during the “war on terror” and the rise of gorpcore, and looks at why military surplus became a thing after the second world war – apparently, asthe Manhattan Projectwas top secret and there were plans for many more years of war, millions of uniforms were made that wouldn’t be needed. (The next season will be about cowboy style – another excavation of the archetypes that make up American fashion. But so far, she says, “I just have books.”)It’s clear that many people from beyond the world of fashion tune in. Sometimes, Trufelman’s listeners contact her – including “a conservative Jewish woman in Toronto, and this Indigenous guy who lives on a reservation. Part of the reason I got started on this military series is I heard from so many soldiers and veterans,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘Arguably the most important single figure in fashion’ … A portrait of George ‘Beau’ Brummell from 1805.Illustration: Art Images/Getty ImagesHer main takeaway from the series is that the military is an inexorable part of her life. “This is like what my taxes go to … I need to stop pretending I have nothing to do with it – and, in fact, demand more from it.” Demanding more from an army meant to serve civilians feels particularly pertinent: we talk just a few days after the newly elected New York mayorZohran Mamdani’s visit to the White House, where he challenged Donald Trump about his threat to deploy the national guard in the city. “It’s very real and it’s very strange,” she says.Gear took two years to make, in part because Trufelman was doing it at the same time as writing a book about the Antwerp Six, a group of experimental Belgian designers, including Ann Demeulemeester, Walter van Beirendonck and Dries van Noten, whose work established Antwerp as a fashion capital in the 1980s. Part of the writing process was “going back and forth to Belgium and learning Dutch”.Trufelman’s podcasts burst at the seams with fascinating characters and facts that deserve to be mainstream knowledge. There have been standalone episodes on plaid, and its journey from Scotland to India, Kenya and US slave plantations; paisley; and the colonial roots of Hawaiian shirts. In an episode on suits she links the flamboyant dress of Charles I to the growth of liberalism, and points to Beau Brummell as “arguably the most important single figure in fashion”. The flamboyant Regency dandy may also be in part to blame for skinny jeans – he chose trousers so tight that he needed an assistant to help him put them on.Articles of Interest is not just a riposte to wrong-headed snobbery about fashion. It’s also the perfect antidote to the clickbait micro-trends that characterise much of the fashion industry and the media that cover it. I ask Trufelman why (aside from the obvious: patriarchy) it is so often necessary to reiterate that fashion doesn’t just mean what Kim Kardashian is wearing, but also why Kim Kardashian’s fashion choices have plenty to tell us.View image in fullscreen‘It’s so rich and complicated’ … Avery Trufelman in camouflage.Photograph: Tif Ng“Everything has trends and styles, but the thing about fashions in clothing is that they’re so external,” she says. They are an expression of your lived experience at that moment; and for some people, that feels like facing their own mortality. “Everybody wants to pretend that they’re not going to die: they’re going to live for ever, their tastes are eternal and they are not living in time. Fashion is an expression of your temporality, an acknowledgment that this too shall pass.”Given her deep understanding of fashion, and wealth of knowledge about even the most seemingly innocuous garment, does she ever get bogged down getting dressed? (Today she’s wearing a beautiful hand-pleated top by the Paris-based designer Julia Heuer.) “It just makes me love everything,” she says. Camo, for example: “It’s just so rich and so complicated. It’s so interesting. Which is probably bad. But I spend so much time with all these things, in the end I’m like: ‘Wow.’” It’s a brilliantly joyful direction to take.Explore more on these topicsFashionPodcastsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, among the downsides would be that the benefits from net zero emissions, which include far lower energy costs, would be delayed.Here we look at the different scenarios laid out by the energy system operator, and the costs for households, businesses and the planet.What is the cost of the government’s net zero plans?In the first analysis of its kind, the National Energy System Operator (Neso) set out the cost of meeting a range of scenarios that tally with the government’s green agenda.The UK already spends about 10% of its gross domestic product on investments related to net zero, and Neso expects those costs will climb over the coming years and remain higher than they are today until the 2030s.In its most ambitious green scenario, costs peak at about £460bn by 2029 before beginning to decline to about 5% of GDP by 2050 or roughly £220bn a year. In the “falling behind” scenario, which models a future of slow climate action in which Britain misses its net zero target and ignores the cost of climate damage, the total costs are about £350bn lower.This calculation does not include the impact of “carbon costs”, meaning any tax that puts a price on polluting to disincentivise producing greenhouse gas emissions and help cover the damaging impacts of fossil fuels on the economy.If these are accounted for, the greenest scenario would have the lowest cost over the next 25 years, saving £36bn a year compared with a scenario in which the UK takes slower climate action. However, it would still mean a sharp rise in costs over the short term.Does this mean higher energy bills?Not necessarily. The Neso report has prompted headlines claiming that households could save £500 a year under a slower path to net zero but – a) these savings rely on ignoring carbon costs and b) the reality of how energy costs are passed on to consumers is far more nuanced.First, the total bill includes spending on a wide range of low-carbon investments that are not included in our energy bills. These include replacing old fossil fuel cars with electric models or replacing old boilers and gas hobs with heat pumps and induction stoves.Second, the way costs are passed through to consumers is a question for the government, which can spread out the bill over a longer period to ease the burden on households, business and industry. Investment in the new Sizewell C nuclear power plant over the next decade could reach £38bn – but the cost to consumers and taxpayers will be spread over the 60-year lifetime of the project.The government says the energy costs levied on household bills, such as the cost of upgrading networks and supporting low-carbon electricity, will reduce costly bottlenecks in energy grids and lower the need to buy gas on volatile global markets.However, higher investment costs do significantly raise the chances of households paying more.The UK’s chief climate advisersaid earlier this yearthat ensuring that the costs of decarbonisation are shared fairly across society must be a top priority for ministers or they risked losing public support for net zero. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of theClimate Change Committee, the independent statutory adviser, said this would help the government to make a “strong, confident” case for decarbonisation as an engine of economic growth.View image in fullscreenThe creation of the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk is expected to cost £38bn over the next decade.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersSo could the costs be lower?Critics of the government’s green agenda claim the UK could save an average of £14bn a year by dropping the legally binding target to reach net zero by 2050. Instead, the country could take a slower approach to climate action via Neso’s “falling behind” scenario.But this would ignore the cost of worsening climate damage. The report cautioned that ultimately the cost of ignoring carbon costs would be higher beyond 2050, owing to the higher cost of fossil fuels.The UK would also miss out on many of the “non-financial benefits of net zero” – such as improvements to public health, the natural environment, and social wellbeing–and could experience negative trade effects as economic partners targeted faster emissions reductions.“It would be wrong to interpret a delay in this cost as implying that the cost is avoided entirely,” the report warned.Can we trust this report?Neso is a government-owned authority and its scenarios form the basis of forecasts produced by policy and business leaders. But its report has important limitations and cannot be taken at face value.The path set by the government is unlikely to follow any one individual scenario produced by Neso, and the final cost will depend on myriad regulatory decisions. Neso said its models were “not fully optimised to minimise cost”, meaning further savings could be found. The models are also based on a range of assumptions – including the future market price of fossil fuels and cost of low-carbon technologies such as heat pumps and electric vehicles.“This implies that the efficient delivery of any given pathway may be as important for cost as the choice of pathway,” the report added.What does the government say?The government was quick to underline the limitations of the report in estimating the costs of net zero, while backing its findings on its benefits. “We fundamentally reject the idea that these illustrative scenarios accurately reflect the cost of moving to clean energy, which has enormous benefits in bringing down bills for good, energy security and securing well-paid, skilled jobs,” a spokesperson said.“Neso makes clear that driving for clean energy saves money by protecting future generations, and fundamentally reduces our exposure to fossil fuel markets, which have caused half of all recessions since the 1970s. As Neso says, they do not reflect or predict the cost of net zero, recognising the likely path is highly dependent on future fuel prices and the advancing pace of private sector rollout of net zero technologies.”So does it still make sense to accelerate our green ambitions?Absolutely, according to world-leading scientists and experts. Greenpeace UK’s head of climate, Mel Evans, said the report set out “the clear and positive impacts of Britain standing firm on its path towards clean energy”.“Not only will it help eliminate our planet-heating emissions and make the UK a global leader on climate action – inspiring others to follow in our footsteps – but it will also slash our energy costs in half.”He added: “One thing this report … doesn’t account for, however, is the huge cost of failing to shift to clean energy, and therefore tackle climate change. Damage caused by the climate crisis has cost a whopping £13m an hour globally for the past 20 years, making the economic argument for investing in net zero just as strong as the environmental one.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisEnergyEnergy billsRenewable energyexplainersShareReuse this content"

She then reportedly began a nervy, 10-hour road trip, through 10 military checkpoints, towards the fishing village where she took a boat towards Curaçao. From there, Machado took a business jet to Bangor in the US state of Maine, before flying on to Oslo.Machado’s decision to flee along one ofVenezuela’s most treacherous people-smuggling routeswas a highly symbolic one, which shone a light on the migration crisis she has promised to end through her dogged campaign for political change.More than 8 million Venezuelans have fled abroad since Maduro took power in 2013 and their country was plunged into more than a decade of economic mayhem, hyperinflation, hunger and increasingly authoritarian rule.During last year’s election – which independently verified data showed was won by Machado’s ally, Edmundo González – her main pledge was to reunite families separated by Venezuela’s collapse.LiveNobel laureate Machado attends presser in Oslo – watch liveCarlos Lizarralde, the author of the book One in Four: The Exodus that Emptied Venezuela, said: “Fleeing by boat to a Caribbean island, María Corina Machado joined the millions of Venezuelans who have escaped by sea and on foot to seek better fortunes – or in her case to change the fortunes of the entire country.”Lizarralde believed Machado had “departed to return as the nation’s leader” as the US campaign to topple Maduro with a massive military buildup in the Caribbean reached “a critical juncture”.“To fulfil her promise of reuniting Venezuela’s families, she first had to follow the path of the exiles who went before her,” added Lizarralde, who believed Machado would, for now, be better positioned to push for democratic change from outside Venezuela.Not everyone agrees. Venezuela has a long history of opposition leaders who have lost influence after going into exile, among them Leopoldo López andJuan Guaidó, the young congressman who spearheaded the last major attempt to remove Maduro in 2019. A prominent journalist from Venezuela’s state-run network Telesur called the Nobel ceremony Machado’s “political funeral”.View image in fullscreenThe plane carrying Machado arrives at Oslo airport on Wednesday.Photograph: Amanda Pedersen Giske/EPASome wonder if Machado may also lose sway if she is unable to return home, although she rejected that suggestion after reaching Oslo. “I’m going to be in the place where I’m most useful for our cause,” Machado told the BBC. “Until a short time ago, the place I thought I had to be was Venezuela; the place I believe I have to be today, on behalf of our cause, is Oslo.”Others are more optimistic about Machado’s chances of sustaining her challenge to Maduro while overseas, pointing to the huge popular support she built while crisscrossing Venezuela by car, motorbike and boat before the 2024 election.“[Even]before winning the election, she had already become the most popular Venezuelan leader since Hugo Chávez,” said Lizarralde, attributing that appeal to Machado’s longstanding refusal to leave Venezuela and her vow to bring millions of divided families back together – including her own.“She became a mother figure who had defied the odds, who had stayed, who had sacrificed, who had given up her own family for the Venezuelan family,” added Lizarralde, who thought Machado would continue to be influential, even outside Venezuela.View image in fullscreenHundreds of people, predominantly from Venezuela, cross the Rio Grande with the intention of seeking humanitarian asylum in the US in 2023.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesNaím was also bullish about Machado’s prospects. “She’s the most legitimate politician in Venezuela. She’s one of the most talented politicians in Latin America, perhaps the world,” he said, predicting she would soon return home.“She may go on a limited international tour … to the main capitals but then that tour ends in Venezuela, [back] in hiding,” he said.Speaking in Oslo, Machado’s adviser David Smolansky declined to explain how his ally could return home but said: “If there’s one thing María Corina has, it’s an extremely high strategic capacity.”“Of course I’m going back,” Machado told the BBC. “I know exactly the risks I’m taking.”Additional reporting by Camille Rodríguez Montilla in OsloExplore more on these topicsMaría Corina MachadoVenezuelaNobel peace prizeNicolás MaduroMigrationAmericasNorwayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Authorities in the country, which is part of the three-member Alliance of Sahel States (AES), called the landing an “unfriendly act carried out in defiance of international law” in a statement that evening.The Nigerian air force said technical concerns had forced the plane to divert to the nearest airport “in line with standard safety procedures and international aviation protocols”. The Burkinabé authorities had treated the crew courteously and plans were under way to continue the mission, it said.Conspiracy theories began circulating on social media and offline given that the landing came within 24 hours of Nigerian troops helping to thwart a coup attempt in Benin, which borders Nigeria and Burkina Faso.The AES trio of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger officially left the larger Ecowas regional bloc in January, forming a military alliance as it withdrew from many of its traditional local and international allegiances.Explore more on these topicsBurkina FasoNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Over the next two years, the plan is to “deploy” the chatbot to more than 5,000 public schools in an “AI-powered education program”.xAI’s Grok is more known forreferring to itself as “MechaHitler”and espousing far-right conspiracy theories than it is for public education. Over the past year, the chatbot has spewed variousantisemitic content,decried “white genocide”and claimedDonald Trump won the 2020 election.AI chatbot ‘MechaHitler’ could be making content considered violent extremism, expert witness tells X v eSafety caseRead moreNayib Bukele, El Salvador’s president, is now entrusting the chatbot to create curricula in classrooms across the country. Bukele has long embraced technology, makingEl Salvadorthe first county in the world to use bitcoin as legal tender, and being one of the first Central American presidents to use Twitter, now X, as a platform. He is also known for ruling with an iron fist and working with Trump to incarcerate deportees to El Salvador’s notorious Cecot prison.“El Salvador doesn’t just wait for the future to happen; we build it,” Bukele said in astatementabout the partnership with xAI. “This partnership is destined to deliver something rather extraordinary for all of humanity.”Musk touted his partnership with Bukele on Thursday. OnX, between posts about “white genocide” and blaming asylum seekers for crime, Musk posted comments about Grok being spread throughout El Salvador’s schools.He reposted positively to a comment from Katie Miller, the wife of Trump’s senior adviser Stephen Miller, in which she wrote: “If we are serious about restoring education to math, science and English – why would we allow left leaning liberal [sic] AI our kids? This unlocks non-woke educational tools for our kids.”xAI is not the first artificial intelligence company to introduce chatbots to public schools. OpenAIannounceda partnership with Estonia in February where it could provide all students and teachers in the country’s secondary school system with a customized ChatGPT. Students in rural Colombia also started using Meta’s AI chatbots in 2023 and within a year, teachers began blaming the tech for low grades and failing exams,according to Rest of World.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyElon MuskArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingXEl SalvadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He plans to return toMaryland, where he has lived for many years with his US citizen wife and child after first entering the country illegally as a teenager.His lawyer added that he does not yet know what will happen next but is ready to continue fighting any additional deportation attempts on his client’s behalf.Who is Kilmar Ábrego García and why has his case become a lightning rod for Trump’s immigration crackdown?Read moreThe Maryland judge’s decision followed a habeas petition filed by Ábrego and his legal team, arguing that the federal government lacked authority to keep him in custody because no final deportation order had been issued. The ruling marks a significant legal win for Ábrego, whose previous wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador turned him into a symbol of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration policies.In response, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) strongly condemned the judge’s decision and announced plans to appeal, labeling the ruling as “naked judicial activism”.The case of Ábrego, a Salvadorian national who was a construction worker in Maryland, has become a proxy for the partisan struggle overDonald Trump’s sweeping immigration policy and mass deportation agenda.Trump administration officials have waged a relentless public relations campaign against Ábrego, repeatedly referring to him as a member of the MS-13 gang, among other things, despite the fact he has not been convicted of any crimes. His attorneys have denounced the criminal charges. Ábrego has said that, while imprisoned inEl Salvador, he endured beatings, sleep deprivation and psychological torture.US district judge Paula Xinis stated in her Thursday order: “Since Ábrego García’s wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been redetained, again without lawful authority.”Xinis indicated the lack of a valid removal order means the government cannot legally deport Ábrego from the US.Earlier in the month, federal prosecutors asked the Maryland judge overseeing Ábrego’s immigration case to lift the restriction ondeportinghim to Liberia. They said Liberia had provided assurances that he would not face persecution or torture there.Ábrego was deported in March to anEl Salvador mega-prison. The deportation happened despite a 2019 court ruling that prohibited his deportation to El Salvador due to credible fears of persecution.His mistaken deportation to the prison in March set off aprominent legal fightover his return – emblematic of the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies.Government lawyers later acknowledged that his removal resulted from a procedural mistake. Multiple federal judges and a unanimous supreme court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return after determining his arrest was “illegal”.In June, Ábrego wasbrought backto the US to face human smuggling charges in Tennessee, where he entered a not guilty plea. Since then, the Trump administration has sought to deport him to several nations, including Ghana, Liberia, and Uganda.After being released to his brother’s custody in Maryland while awaiting trial, he was again taken into custody by immigration officials and was detained in Pennsylvania.In August, Xinis issued an orderpreventinghis immediate removal from the US.Explore more on these topicsKilmar Ábrego GarcíaTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS immigrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MarylandnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump has accusedVenezuelaof facilitating drug trafficking, and increased the US military presence in the Caribbean to a level not seen in decades. The administration has also conducted a campaign of bombings of alleged drug boats, killing more than 80 people so far.Trump confirmed the tanker seizure shortly after it occurred, telling reporters: “We’ve just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela – large tanker, very large, largest one ever seized, actually.” When asked what would happen to the oil, Trump responded: “We keep the oil, I guess!”1:08Footage shows US forces taking control of oil tanker off Venezuelan coast – videoSenator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who serves on the Senate foreign relations committee, said the tanker seizure indicated the administration was being dishonest about its military operations in the region.What do we know about the oil tanker seized by the US off the Venezuela coast?Read more“This shows that their whole cover story – that this is about interdicting drugs – is a big lie,” Van Hollen said. “This is just one more piece of evidence that this is really about regime change – by force.”Rand Paul, a Republican senator of Kentucky,told NewsNationthat “seizing someone’s oil tanker is an initiation of war” and questioned whether “it’s the job of the American government to go looking for monsters around the world, looking for adversaries and beginning wars”.Chris Coons, a Democratic senator, said he was also alarmed at the administration’s actions, telling the station: “I have no idea why the president is seizing an oil tanker and I’m fairly gravely concerned that he’s sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela.”Mark Warner, also a Democratic senator, highlighted what he characterized as inconsistent priorities, posting on social media: “So they can seize an oil tanker, but not a drug boat?”Map showing path of tankerChuck Schumer, when asked by CNN whether he opposed Trump’s goal of regime change in Venezuela, refused to answer, saying Trump’s erratic messaging made it impossible to know his true intentions.“The bottom line is President Trump throws out so many different things in so many different ways, you don’t even know what the heck he’s talking about,” the Senate minority leader said.“Obviously, if Maduro would just flee on his own, everyone would like that,” he said, but added the lack of clarity made it impossible to endorse specific policies.The attorney general, Pam Bondi,saidthe FBI, Homeland Security Investigations and the Coast Guard had executed a seizure warrant for the vessel, which she said had been transporting sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran for years as part of a network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.Venezuela’s government called the seizure “a blatant theft and an act of international piracy”, claiming it revealed that US aggression has “always been about our natural resources, our oil, our energy”.Not all were opposed. When Ted Cruz, a Republican senator of Texas, was asked for his reaction on the oil tanker seizure, he deflected and said Trump was saving American lives by targeting drug smugglers.In November, when Iran seized a Marshall Islands-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz,US Central Commandcondemned it as a “blatant violation of international law” that undermined freedom of navigation and commerce.Adam Schiff, a Democratic senator from California, called it a “very dangerous escalation and a prelude to potential conflict”. Last week he and Paul, along with fellow senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Schumer, filed a war powers resolution aimed at blocking the administration from military engagement with Venezuela without congressional approval.The administration has deployed what it describes as the largest naval presence in the Caribbean since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, ostensibly to target what Trump has dubbed as “narco-terrorists”. But US drug enforcement officials notedin a May reportthat fentanyl primarily enters the US through Chinese producers and Mexican criminal organizations, while cocaine mainly comes from Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDemocratsRepublicansUS politicsUS foreign policyVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Cambodia and Thailand each accuse the other ofviolating the peace deal.In Washington, Trump told reporters he was due to call the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia on Thursday, and predicted he could settle the hostilities “pretty quickly”.LiveCivilians flee as Thailand strikes targets at border with Cambodia – video“I think I can get them to stop fighting. Who else can do that?” Trump said on Wednesday.The US, China and Malaysia, as chair of the regional bloc Asean,brokered a ceasefire back in July, and six weeks ago Trump presided over the signing of an enhanced agreement.But Thailand suspended the agreement the following month after a Thai soldier was wounded by a landmine. Thailand alleged the landmine had been newly laid by Cambodia – an allegation it has denied.Political instability in Thailand may complicate future negotiations. On Thursday night, the prime minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, said on social media that he was “returning power to the people”, with reports suggesting he has requested the dissolution of parliament – a move that would pave way for elections within 45-60 days.Analysts say that, with a vote looming, Anutin may try to present himself as a strong nationalist prepared to take a tough stance on the border conflict.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Thai villagers wait for food distribution at a school.Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPAThailand’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Nikorndej Balankura, told reporters on Wednesday that the fighting would eventually end through talks, but now was not the time for dialogue.“If any third country wants to mediate, Thailand can’t accept that at this stage because the line has been crossed,” he said. “Thai citizens have been killed and we need to ensure there is enough trust before talks can begin.”More than 400,000 civilians in Thailand have been evacuated to shelters, according to a defence ministry spokesperson.Visut Krimsilp, 47, who was among dozens of people sheltering at a local government building in Ubon Ratchathani province, said she simply wanted the authorities to find a way to end the conflict.“Whatever it takes, [just] push through to the end,” she said.

It has a great effect on us.”In Cambodia, more than 101,000 people had been evacuated to shelters and relatives’ homes, the defence ministry spokesperson, Maly Socheata, told reporters.Cambodia’s interior ministry gave an updated death toll of 10 civilians. Maly earlier said an infant was among those killed.Cambodia withdrew on Wednesday from the Southeast Asian Games in Thailand, citing safety concerns for its athletes.The combat has drawn international concern, including from Pope Leo XIV, who told an audience at the Vatican on Wednesday that he was “deeply saddened by the news of the renewed conflict”.“There have been casualties, including among civilians, and thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes,” the pontiff said. “I express my closeness in prayer to these dear peoples.”Explore more on these topicsCambodiaThailandAsia PacificDonald TrumpUS foreign policyTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They were posted from Macau, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory near Hong Kong. The letters have five deepfaked images of Lau, with her face superimposed on women’s bodies either naked or in underwear. One image shows the fake Lau performing a sex act, which has been pixelated.The text on the letter states Lau’s name and supposed body measurements. It includes her former home address in full and states: “Welcome to visit me! You have the right to choose me, and I also have the right not to accept you. Just want the process to be gentle. We can become close friends in the future!”In Australia,Ted Hui, a former Hong Kong legislator, and his wife have been targeted with a fake poster advertising his wife’s services as a sex worker. The poster shows an old photograph of Hui and his wife under the headline “Hong Kong lonely housewife”.Underneath the picture there is a menu of sexual services with prices in Australian dollars. The poster also includes an address, which Hui said was not connected to him. The poster was emailed to his boss over the summer and posted to people inAdelaideat and around the address listed on the poster.Lau said she was “terrified” when she learned of the letters. “I am a woman, and they threaten me like this,” she said. Lau said the letters represented “an escalation of transnational repression” where AI or digital tools were used to specifically target women.Hui said he had “expected something like this to come”. His wife was “speechless”, he said. She is not a public figure and it is the first time she has been included in the harassment against her husband.View image in fullscreenTed Hui said he’d ‘expected something like this’, but his wife, who is not a public figure, was ‘speechless’.Photograph: James Gourley/EPAHui said he reported the poster to the police who said the IP address from which the email was sent could be traced to Hong Kong.A resident of the address in Adelaide listed on the poster about Hui said he had never heard of the exiled Hongkonger. He said his wife had been scared by the poster turning up in their letterbox.“How did they get our address? Why did they pick us? It just doesn’t make sense,” the resident said. He said a neighbour had asked him if his house had become a “knock shop”, slang for a brothel.The letters were reported to the police. A South Australia police spokesperson said they could not comment on individual cases.In March, Lau’s neighbours received “wanted” postersoffering a rewardof HK$1m (£96,000) for any member of the public who could provide information about her or take her to the Chinese embassy.Neighbours ofTony Chung, a young Hong Kong activist who wasgranted asylumin the UK this year, received similar letters about him.In Australia, similar letters were sent aboutKevin Yam, an Australian-Hongkonger lawyer who is subject to a Hong Kong arrest warrant for his pro-democracy activism, and about Hui.But this is the first time anyone wanted by the Hong Kong authorities has been targeted with sexually explicit material.One of the people who received the letter in Maidenhead said it showed “graphic images of her sexual acts … basically offering services”.“It’s obviously unfortunate for the person who it’s targeted at,” said the resident, who asked to remain anonymous. They had also received the previous letter offering a reward for Lau’s whereabouts.Lau moved house after the bounty reward letters were sent in March. She said the experiences made her feel uneasy in public. “If I ever go out, I try to wear a cap or a face mask to avoid being recognised,” she said. “The psychological burden is heavy.”Lau has previouslycriticisedThames Valley police for their handling of the original letters sent in March, after they asked her to sign an agreement requesting that she “cease any activity that is likely to put you at risk”.The latest letters have also been referred to the police. Lau said she had been told there was a slim chance of finding out who was responsible for them.Joshua Reynolds, the MP for Maidenhead, said the letters were an act of transnational repression “without question” and called on the government to take decisive action, including imposing sanctions on officials involved in raising bounties on activists living in Britain.“It’s the point now where it’s Beijing’s efforts to intimidate and to threaten pro-democracy Hongkongers,” Reynolds said. “It’s utterly grotesque what they’re doing, and now is the point where the government can’t stick their head in the sand when it comes to the safety of Hongkongers in our country.”It is not clear who sent the sexually explicit letters. The Chinese embassy previously said the bounty letters were faked.Responding to the latest letters about Lau, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London reiterated their previous comments. “000[who] fled overseas seeking to destabilise Hong Kong,” the spokesperson said.“It is legitimate and reasonable to pursue wanted fugitives. Rather than cheating and sadfishing, those anti-China rioters who fled overseas should surrender themselves to the police as soon as possible.”The Chinese embassy in Canberra did not respond to a request for comment.Thames Valley police said: “We are investigating reports of a malicious communications offence. The malicious communications are believed to be digitally altered images. We are engaging with the victim and, at this time, no arrests have been made.”A UK government spokesperson said: “The safety and security of Hongkongers in the United Kingdom is of the utmost importance. We encourage anyone to report concerns to the police.”Explore more on these topicsHong KongChinaAsia PacificDeepfakeEnglandAdelaidePolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Monsoon rains often bring some flooding but the scientists were clear: this was “not normal”.In Sri Lanka, some floods reached the second floor of buildings, while in Sumatra, inIndonesia, the floods were worsened by the destruction of forests, which in the past slowed rainwater running off hillsides.Millions of people were affected when Cyclone Ditwahstruck Sri Lankaand Cyclone Senyarhit Sumatraand peninsular Malaysia in late November, and the events became some of the deadliest weather-related disasters in recent history.Theanalysis by World Weather Attribution, a consortium of climate scientists, found the intensity of five-day episodes of heavy rain had increased by 28-160% in the region affected by Cyclone Senyar owing to human-caused global heating. In Sri Lanka, the periods of heavy rain are now between 9% and 50% more intense.‘The current could kill an elephant’: Asia flood survivors describe escaping with their livesRead moreWhile at least 1,750 people died in the floods and hundreds more remain missing, cyclones also have a wide and enduring impact on health. Recent studies havefound deathsfrom, for example, diabetes andkidney disease increaseafter such storms. Many people have also lost their homes and their livelihoods, with the poorest affected most.“The combination of heavy monsoon rains and climate change is a deadly mix,” said Dr Sarah Kew, an academic at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and the lead author of the study. “Monsoon rains are normal in this part of the world. What is not normal is the growing intensity of these storms.”Prof Lalith Rajapakse, at the University of Moratuwa inSri Lanka, who was part of the study, said: “Cyclones like Ditwah have become an alarming new reality for Sri Lanka and the wider south and south-east Asian region, bringing unprecedented rainfall, widespread loss of life and massive disruption to economic activities.”“Flooding is quite common to us every year during the monsoon season: we expect flooding, but up to about 1ft to maximum 2ft level,” he said. “But this time what happened was in some areas it was exceeding 14 to 15ft. So even not reaching the second floor could sometimes save the affected people.”View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of a landslide in Gampola, Sri Lanka.

Warmer air can hold more moisture, making rain heavier.For the study, the researchers examined weather records to assess how periods of heavy rain have changed as the planet has heated by the 1.3C seen today, and found significant increases in intensity. The range in estimates, from 28-160% in the region affected by Cyclone Senyar, for example, is due to a range of meteorological data series being used.Climate models are used in these studies to estimate how much more likely extreme weather events have been made by global heating. In this case, the models did not replicate the events well, with natural fluctuations in ocean temperatures – La Niña and the Indian Ocean Dipole – being complicating factors.However, analysis of the weather data and measurements of increased ocean temperatures meant the scientists concluded that global heating had supercharged the downpours from the cyclones.Dr Mariam Zachariah, at Imperial College London, said: “These events illustrate how climate change and natural variability can align to produce exceptional heavy rainfall. While natural variability is inherent to the climate system, reducing reliance on fossil fuels is within our power and necessary for reducing the intensity of future extreme events.”Maja Vahlberg, at the Red Cross Red Climate Centre, said: “Large parts of Sri Lanka and Indonesia have experienced devastation on a scale that very few people living there have seen in their lifetimes. Unfortunately, it is the most vulnerable people who experience the worst impacts, and have the longest road to recovery.”Families on rooftops, homes buried by mud: Asia floods show water is overtaking wind as main threatRead moreShe pointed to two factors that had worsened the impacts: people migrating to towns and cities and the razing of forests: “Over decades growth has increasingly taken place in low-lying floodplains, deltas and river corridors. These areas are economic hubs, with roads, power lines, hospitals, markets. But they’re also the natural pathways for flood waters.”“Deforestation and the loss of wetlands also reduce the land’s ability to absorb the water on hillsides,” Vahlberg said. “This increases the risk of landslides, and downstream it raises flood peaks and carried debris into settled areas in Sumatra.”Early estimates of the damage in Sri Lanka were $6-7 bn, or 3-5% of national GDP, Rajapakse said: “This should be an unequivocal eye-opener to the scale of future climate-driven extremes the country and the region must prepare for.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisFloodingHurricanesExtreme weatherAsia PacificSri LankaIndonesianewsShareReuse this content"

Or what will stop them disguising themselves as civilians and taking over this free economic zone? This is all very serious. It’s not a fact that Ukraine would agree to it, but if you are talking about a compromise then it has to be a fair compromise.”He said if Ukraine did agree to such a scheme, there would need to be elections or a referendum to ratify it, saying that only “the Ukrainian people” could make decisions on territorial concessions.1:18Zelenskyy says ceasefire needed before elections can take place in Ukraine – videoUnder the US plans, said Zelenskyy, Ukraine would withdraw from Donbas, where Russia is advancing, while the frontlines would be frozen in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Russia would give up a few small pockets of land it controls in other regions.Zelenskyy has been under immense pressure from Donald Trump to sign up to the US peace plan. In recent days Trump has attacked Zelenskyy, claiming he “has not even read” the draft peace plan andsuggesting he lacks legitimacyand Ukraine should hold an election.Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said on Thursday: “The president is extremely frustrated with both sides of this war, and he is sick of meetings just for the sake of meeting.”Zelenskyy said the Ukrainian negotiating team had sent their revised plan back to Washington on Wednesday, and that questions over territory and control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant were two of the remaining sticking points. “It’s not the final plan; it’s a reaction to what we received … the plan is constantly being worked on and edited, and this is a continuous process that is still going on,” he said.If Washington and Kyiv do agree, the much bigger question remains of whetherVladimir Putinis really ready to sign a deal or is merely buying time with fake negotiations and hoping to continue his military advance over the winter.In Berlin, the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, said on Thursday that if Putin was allowed to get his way in Ukraine then the prospect of war inEuropewould become more real, warning that the continent had been “quietly complacent” over the threat from Russia.A new war waged by Russia could come within the next five years and could be “on the scale of war our grandparents and great-grandparents endured”, Rutte suggested. He issued a now-familiar call for all European countries to increase defence spending. “Too many believe that time is on our side. It is not. The time for action is now,” he added.Rutte is among the European politicians who have been working hard to keep the Trump administration on side when it comes to Ukraine policy, as the US president appears to get ever more impatient with the lack of a peace deal.On Thursday afternoon, Zelenskyy held a video call with about 30 leaders from the “coalition of the willing” nations, which support Ukraine, but without Trump.In some European capitals there is increasing sentiment that Ukraine will have to make painful compromises, as the country enters its fourth winter of full-scale war, with a difficult situation on the frontline and huge power issues caused by repeated Russian strikes on energy infrastructure.However, the leaders of France, Britain and Germany, whomet Zelenskyy in Downing Street on Monday, are keen to stress that only Ukraine can decide on territorial questions. “It would be a mistake to force the Ukrainian president into a peace that his people will not accept after four years of suffering and death,” Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, said on Thursday.Zelenskyy said that in addition to the overall framework agreement, there were two separate documents that Ukraine hoped to sign in the coming days, one on potential security guarantees that would come into effect if Russia attacked Ukraine again and one on Ukraine’s economic renewal.Also on Thursday, top EU officials met in Lviv, in western Ukraine, to discuss Ukraine’s accession prospects, even as Hungary’s Russia-friendly leader, Viktor Orbán, continues to block formal negotiations.All other EU members are in favour of Ukraine joining, and officials have said they want to accept Ukraine anyway provided the country can move forward on aligning its laws and practices with EU regulations. “Ukraine will become a member of the EU, and nobody can block it,” said Marta Kos, the EU enlargement commissioner, at the talks.Zelenskyy said he hoped Trump would put pressure on Hungary and any other EU country that might block Ukraine. “We all understand that the US president has various levers of influence, and these will work on those who are currently blocking Ukraine,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS foreign policyDonald TrumpVladimir PutinEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

They warned that the Afghans risked “persecution, abuse and death” if they were returned.Karl Kopp, the head of the German NGO Pro Asyl, criticised the government’s decision as “ice cold”.He added: “The previous government promised to take these people in for one reason only: they had fought for women’s rights, human rights and freedom in Afghanistan.”The people affected were now in acute danger and at risk of falling into the hands of the Islamist Taliban regime, he said. “For the new government, this shameful treatment of people in mortal danger is a declaration of moral bankruptcy.”After theTaliban’s return to powerfour years ago, Germany’s then centre-left-led government launched programmes offering refuge to “especially endangered people” including local staff who had worked for the German military or government ministries, as well as rights activists and journalists.Until April 2025, before Merz took office in May, about 4,000 local staff and 15,000 of their family members had been resettled in Germany, according to official data.Since then, a few hundred Afghans have been evacuated fromPakistanbut the current government has largely moved to phase out that policy, offering money to those who renounce their right to be resettled. The interior ministry said last month only 62 people had taken up the offer.Up to 1,800 Afghans approved for relocation to Germany have been stranded in Pakistan for months, NGOs say.The interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, has spearheaded many of the government’s toughest measures to block new arrivals.He has concluded that only Afghanswith a “legally binding” promise should remain eligible for resettlement. The interior ministry said this would cover only 90 of the 220 local staff still awaiting evacuation.A former local police training officer and father of fourtold the daily Frankfurter Rundschauthat he had waited two years to enter Germany and was shocked by the decision. “In a single moment, all my hopes and dreams of a normal life were shattered,” he was quoted as saying.The military affairs reporter Thomas Wiegold said the about-face could have long-term consequences for any future missions abroad. “German soldiers can only fervently hope that they will never, ever, ever again be dependent on local support anywhere,” he wrote on Bluesky.More than 250 NGOs issued an open letter this week criticising the government for failing to honour Berlin’s promises to Afghans left in limbo, 70% of whom, they noted, are women and children.Groups including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and religious organisations called on the government to evacuate all 1,800 people before the end of the year – the deadline announced by the Pakistani government for them to leave.Last year, Germany resumed deportations to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, with the then chancellor, Olaf Scholz, promising a more aggressive approach to removals of those with a criminal record.Several such flights have taken placeunder the current government, even as the foreign ministry warns of widespread human rights violations in Afghanistan, including “torture, extrajudicial killings, corporal punishment and public executions”.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanGermanyFriedrich MerzEuropeSouth and central AsiaThe far rightPakistannewsShareReuse this content"

Power stems from the voice of the people.”After a meeting of the ruling parties’ leaders, he later added: “People of all ages, ethnic backgrounds and religions have spoken out in favour of [the government’s] resignation. This civic energy must be supported and encouraged.”Tens of thousands of Bulgarians had rallied on Wednesday evening in the capital, Sofia, and dozens of other towns and cities across the country in the latest in a series of rolling demonstrations giving vent to the public’s growing frustration.Protesters chanted “Resign” and held up “I’m fed up!” signs featuring caricatures of politicians.View image in fullscreenRosen Zhelyazkov: ‘People of all ages, ethnic backgrounds and religions have spoken out in favour of [the government’s] resignation.’Photograph: Stoyan Nenov/ReutersGergana Gelkova, 24, a shop worker, told Agence France-Presse she joined the protest because widespread corruption had become “intolerable”.Students from Sofia’s universities joined the mass protest in the capital, which Bulgarian media estimated, based on drone visuals, had drawn more than 100,000 people in a country of just under 7 million.Similar protests took place last week sparked by the government’s budget plans for tax increases, higher social security contributions and state spending hikes. The government later withdrew the draft 2026 budget.Protesters had labelled the ill-fated budget as a veiled attempt to mask rampant corruption, which successive governments have failed to root out, and expanded their demands to include calls for the centre-right government to step down.The country’s Moscow-friendly president, Rumen Radev, also called on the government to resign, saying on his Facebook page: “Between the voice of the people and the fear of the mafia. Listen to the public squares!”Radev will now ask the parties in parliament to try to form a new government. If, as seems likely, they are unable to do so, he will put together an interim administration that will run the country until a new election – the eighth in four years – can be held.The EU’s poorest country has been racked by political instability and uncertainty, with analysts saying that low trust in its national institutions and leaders had been exacerbated by fears of higher prices as Bulgaria prepares to adopt the euro.View image in fullscreenA protester waves the Bulgarian flag at an anti-government protest in Sofia on Wednesday.Photograph: Dimitar Kyosemarliev/AFP/GettyThe European Commission has repeatedly warned against failings in the rule of law in Bulgaria, saying in a July report that the level of perceived judicial independence there was “very low” and the country’s anti-corruption strategy “limited”.Dobromir Zhivkov, the director of the Market Links sociological agency, said Bulgarian society was “in broad unity against the model of governance”, adding that plummeting trust in ministers and MPs was “another indicator of severe political and institutional crisis”.Bulgaria is near the bottom of the European Corruption Perception Index maintained by Transparency International. It has gone to the polls seven times since huge anti-graft protests in 2020 against Boyko Borissov, a three-time former prime minister.Borissov’s conservative GERB party finished as the largest in the most recent election last year and formed the current coalition government in January, with Zhelyazkov, a former transport minister and senior GERB member, as premier.Protesters are particularly angered by Delyan Peevski, a former media mogul whose DPS – New Beginning party is one of an array of several factions from across the political spectrum that backs Zhelyazkov’s minority government.Peevski, who has been hit with sanctions by the US and the UK for alleged corruption, bribery and embezzlement, is accused of influencing government policy to favour oligarchs. He has denied all allegations of wrongdoing.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Overtourism has became a major concern for the city’s residents, however.A two-and-a-half-hour drive south of Amsterdam, Eindhoven is the fifth largest city in theNetherlandsby population. It is also a major technology hub and has a long-running association with the consumer electronics company Philips.“The Rijksmuseum in Eindhoven will be a valuable addition to the cultural landscape of Brabant and beyond,” said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, a former Dutch finance minister now serving as Eindhoven’s mayor. “This museum is set to become a place where everyone can enjoy a unique blend of history and creativity.”The Rijksmuseum is the latest European museum to open a near or far-flung outpost. Paris’s Louvre opened an offshoot in Lens, a former mining town in northern France, in 2012 and a further branch in Abu Dhabi in 2017.London’s V&A, which specialises in the applied arts, is scheduled to open a branch in the city’s former Olympic park in April.Artlovers can already visit its East Storehouse, which opened in the park in May.Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsMuseumsPaintingArt (Education)RembrandtEuropeArt (Art and design)newsShareReuse this content"

They werejoined on Wednesday by Iceland, where the board of the national broadcaster RÚV voted not to participate.In their statement, Nemo said: “This is not about individuals or artists. The contest was repeatedly used to soften the image of a state accused of severe wrongdoing, all while the EBU insisted Eurovision is ‘non-political’. And when entire countries withdraw over this contradiction, it should be clear that something is deeply wrong. That’s why I’ve decided that I’m sending my trophy back to the EBU headquarters in Geneva.”The Israeli broadcaster Kan has welcomed the decision to keep Israel in the contest, rejecting allegations of political interference. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, has said Israel “deserves to be represented on every stage around the world”.Eurovision has faced political boycotts before – how does the latest compare?Read moreOn Wednesday, Israel’s embassy in Norway, which also manages Israel’s relations with Iceland, said it was “disappointed” by RÚV’s move, which it said went “entirely against the spirit of the contest”.With six months to go, 34 countries are slated to participate in next year’s edition but some have yet to say whether they will take part.The BBC, which runs an internal selection process for the UK’s representative, has said it supports the decisions taken at the EBU summit but has not responded to questions as to whether this means it will participate or not.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionEurovision 2024Israel-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

At the age of 18 she was arrested over allegedly participating in the killing of her abusive husband, Alireza Abil, in May 2018, and sentenced toqisas– retribution-in-kind.Mai Sato, UN special rapporteur on the situation for human rights in Iran, said: “It’s great that Kouhkan won’t be executed – one life has been saved … but it doesn’t really solve the issue of theqisaslaw, which is in violation of many international standards.” Sato, along with three other UN experts,said earlier this monththat the case “exemplifies the systemic gender bias faced by women victims of child marriage and domestic violence within Iran’s criminal justice system”.Child bride faces execution in Iran unless she pays £80,000 in ‘blood money’Read moreIn November, the Guardian was thefirst international publicationto reveal that Kouhkan, an undocumented member of Iran’s Baluch minority, would face execution by hanging unless she could raise 10bn tomans (about £80,000) to pay off the victim’s family. Under Iranian law, a victim’s family can pardon someone in return for blood money – compensation payable in cases of murder or bodily harm.Ina statement issued last month, Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, director of Iran Human Rights, said: “The blood-money amount set for her case is several times the official rate, an impossible sum for a young, undocumented Baluch woman from a deprived background who has also been rejected by her family.”Forced to marry her cousin at 12, Kouhkan became pregnant at 13 and gave birth to a son. She suffered physical and emotional abuse for years. On the day her husband was killed, Kouhkan found him beating their son, then aged five. She called her husband’s cousin, Mohammad Abil, for help. When he arrived a fight broke out which resulted in the death of her husband. According toIran Human Rights,Abil remains on death row.Kouhkan’s lawyer confirmed ina post on Instagramon 9 December that the original sum of 10bn tomans had been reduced to 8bn tomans and that amount had been raised through donations. In a video published byMizan News Agency, Kouhkan’s parents-in-law are seen signing documents.Kouhkan hopes to be reunited with her son when she is released, according to Mehdi Ghatei, founder of Qasim Child Foundation, a charity registered in Australia, who had started a fundraiser for Kouhkan. In accordance with Iranian law, Kouhkan’s son is entitled to 2bn tomans of the total blood money, which is “a good sum for establishing a new life”, he said.Olympians call on Iran to halt execution of boxing championRead moreGhatei said he had been contacted by organisations and individuals all over the world after the Guardian’s story about Kouhkan and that international pressure had played a part in saving her life. “The Iranian regime tries to keep people silent,” he said. “When people start raising awareness [of cases such as Kouhkan’s] there is sometimes huge pressure from international bodies, which increases the chances of halting executions. The role of the mainstream media is huge in this case, unbelievable.”At least241 women were executedin Iran between 2010 and 2024, 114 of whom were sentenced toqisasfor homicide. The majority of women executed for homicide in the documented cases had killed their husband or intimate partner. Many of these women were victims of domestic violence or child marriage, or acted in self-defence.Iran executesthe highest number of women in the world, according to available data. Amnesty International said thatat least 30 women were executedin the country last year. At least 42 women have been executed in 2025 so far – 18 for murdering their husbands, including two child brides, according to Iran Human Rights.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentWomen in prisonIranCapital punishmentMiddle East and north AfricaHuman rights (Law)Human rights (Global development)PrisonsnewsShareReuse this content"

Veterans’ groups have decried the charges as “un-American”.“My son is innocent,” said his father, Bajun Ray Mavalwalla, a retired US army intelligence officer with three Bronze stars earned during tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.The elder Mavalwalla said many of the people he meets in conservative easternWashington statebelieve the government has over-reached. He launched an exploratory committee to challenge Spokane’s Republican representative Michael Baumgartner this fall after the Guardian featured his son’s arrest, drawing national attention to the case.At the Veterans of Foreign Wars hall, people say “‘Oh my God! This is an incredible injustice,’” Mavalwalla said. “‘Your son is a hero. He served his country. FBI agents should be out catching bank robbers and human traffickers. To use these agents to handcuff a veteran who was protesting is just ridiculous and a violation of constitutional rights … ‘”The protest turned confrontational, leaving a government van’s windshield smashed and tires slashed, but Mavalwalla was not among the more than two dozen people arrested at the scene. More than a month passed before the FBI arrived at his door on 15 July.Ben Stuckart, the former president of the Spokane city council, called for the protest, declaring in a Facebook post that he intended to physically block the transport of two Venezuelan immigrants who werein the country legallywhen they were arrested by ICE.On Monday, Stuckart pleaded guilty to a felony conspiracy charge, avoiding the maximum sentence of six years in federal prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release.Instead, under an agreement reached with federal prosecutors, he was sentenced to 18 months supervised release with a promise to reduce the charges to a misdemeanor if there are no additional violations.“Situations like this are happening all across the country,” Stuckart said of the arrest of the Venezuelan immigrants, who eventually opted to self-deport after sustained incarceration.“At the time, it was my hope that the government would do the right thing and release them from custody. I understood what I was up against, but I felt it was necessary to take a stand. I accept full responsibility for my conduct,” he said.Court records show prosecutors have now reached plea agreements with four of thenineindividuals arrested for conspiracy after the demonstration in Spokane. Observers believe all but Mavawalla will strike deals to avoid prison. Representatives of the US attorney’s office in Spokane did not respond to repeated requests for comment.In continuing to contest the charges, Mavalwalla faces the same potential penalties Stuckart did: six years in federal prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release.The indictments were handed down two days after career prosecutor Richard Barker, the acting US attorney for eastern Washington state, resigned. In a social post, Barkerwrote: “I am grateful that I never had to sign an indictment or file a brief that I didn’t believe in.”In August, Donald Trump nominated Pete Serrano, a former litigator for the Silent Majority Foundation, a conservative advocacy group, to head the office, while also installing him in an interim capacity. Serrano has no prosecutorial experience and has described the January 6 US Capitol rioters as “political prisoners”.After pleading guilty to conspiracy, Stuckart invoked the memory of Martin Luther King, who was arrested 29 times, often in acts of civil disobedience.King “explained that the antidote to fear is courage”, Stuckart said at sentencing: “We must be courageous, while accepting the consequences for our actions. And we must never stop fighting for each other.”Clayborne Carson, a professor emeritus of history and director of theMartin Luther King Jr Papers Projectat Stanford University, said that the FBI’s arrest of Mavalwalla and his co-defendants represented an escalation from the agency’s activities during the civil rights era.“The FBI spied on Dr King. They spied on me,” he said. “There was even a file that said I had been ‘seen at the beach’.” But back then, Carson said, the FBI was seen as an ‘investigative agency’, not as one that would swoop in and put an activist in handcuffs.“I cannot think of an instance where the FBI arrested Dr King for conspiracy,” he said.Explore more on these topicsWashington stateAfghanistanUS immigrationWest CoastSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The remaining £2.4bn will come from departmental spending outlined in November’s budget.Phillipson said: “This government will fix the broken education system for children and young people with Send by making sure that their local school is also the right school.Ministers face calls to explain how £6bn Send funding hole will be paid forRead more“Ahead of our reforms next year, we’re laying the foundations of a new system that shifts children with Send from forgotten to included and earns the confidence of parents.“This £3bn investment will transform lives. It will open the door to opportunity for tens of thousands of children with Send, giving them the chance to learn, belong and succeed in their local community.”The urgent need for change was highlighted byfiguresshowing that legal action by parents over their children’s special needs provision have continued to soar. The Ministry of Justice said the number of Send appeals heard by tribunals rose for the ninth year in a row to 25,002 in 2024-25, an 18% increase on the previous year.TheDepartment for Education(DfE) is working on reforms to be included in the schools white paper planned for early next year, with the schools minister, Georgia Gould, advisers and DfE officials conducting regional and online forums to gauge responses from parents, charities and school leaders.One of the DfE’s main principles is that children with special needs should be able to attend local schools alongside their peers, rather than having to travel long distances to find suitable provision.The DfE said its announcement would “lay the groundwork for significant future reform of the Send support system, helping to make schools inclusive by design”, with the white paper to detail how schools will be funded to support the specialist places.Gould said the white paper would look at “every aspect of the school system”, including issues such as behaviour and the high proportion of pupils with special needs who are suspended or excluded, while maintaining the important role of special schools for children with complex needs.About 460,000 children and young people in England have special needs provision through education, health and care plans (EHCPs), a legal document agreed between local authorities and families. But many find the EHCP processcomplicated and bureaucratic, forcing increasing numbers to appeal through specialist Send tribunals to modify or enforce their agreements with councils.The figures from the Ministry of Justice show that the number of registered appeals heard by the tribunals rocketed from just over 3,100 a decade ago to 25,002 in the last school year. The backlog has continued to grow, with 15,000 open cases recorded in September.Of the cases decided by the tribunal, 99% were found in favour of the appealing families.Madeleine Cassidy, the chief executive of the Independent Provider of Special Education Advice, a charity that focuses on England’s special needs laws, said: “[The figures] expose the scale of unlawful decision-making in local authorities.Childrenand young people with Send are still being routinely denied the educational provision to which they are legally entitled. This is a systemic failure, and one that must be addressed in next year’s white paper.”Some parents of special school pupils in England spending £5,000 on EHCPsRead moreSome of the new funding comes at the expense of free schools that were in the pipeline, including a Middlesbrough sixth form to be opened in a collaboration between Eton college and the Star academy chain. But two other sixth forms planned by the group, in Dudley and Oldham, will go ahead.The 60,000 special needs places include 10,000 included in special schools within the free school projects paused by the DfE. The department said just 15 special and alternative provision (AP) free schools would continue as planned but local authorities would be given the option to complete the remaining 77 projects or receive equivalent funding to deliver Send places.Meg Powell-Chandler, the director of theNew Schools Network, said: “We regret the decision to cancel a number of projects, and remain concerned that uncertainty persists for 77 vital special and AP free school proposals that would provide much-needed, high-quality specialist places.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsFree schoolsChildrenBridget PhillipsonDepartment for EducationSchool fundingSchoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

All I can say to support that woman is yes I did hear about it, yes I was invited to be a part of the team, yes I saw, I did see, factual transcripts, I know it was going on, I know that the surveillance teams were being used against her and her family. But I can’t provide any documentary evidence for that.”Associated Newspapers Ltd (ANL) is accused by seven claimants, including Sir Elton John and his husband, David Furnish; Elizabeth Hurley; Sadie Frost and Sir Simon Hughes, of carrying out or commissioning unlawful activities such as hiring private investigators to place listening devices inside cars, “blagging” private records and accessing private phone conversations.ANL denies the allegations and is defending the legal action. ANL has said that allegations of unlawful information gathering in relation to Lawrence are “appalling and utterly groundless smears”.Last month, a second private investigator central to the legal action by the Duke of Sussex and others against the publisher of the Daily Mail claimed that his signature on an earlier witness statement was a “forgery”.Gavin Burrows, linked to the most serious allegations of unlawful information, retracted his alleged confession, saying it was “completely false”.Burrows had allegedly claimed in a 2021 witness statement that he and his team obtained information by hacking voicemails, tapping landline phones and bugging cars. He also allegedly said he had worked on behalf of the Mail on Sunday.Five of the claimants have told the high court they embarked on the legal action against ANL based on evidence apparently obtained by Burrows.Burrowspreviously retracted his alleged statement in 2023.In a fresh, 30-page witness statement made on 25 September 2025, and released by the high court last month, he restated his denial, saying he had never carried out any illegal activity on behalf of ANL.The Dispatches programme, broadcast on Thursday, also provided new details as to the funding of those helping Harry and Lawrence build a legal case against Associated Newspapers.According to the programme, the father of James Stunt, long a target of Daily Mail investigations, provided money to Graham Johnson, a former News of the World journalist, who has been assisting as a researcher. James Stunt is the former of husband of Petra Ecclestone.Geoff Stunt told Dispatches that any claim that he “funded research into illegal activities at the Daily Mail as some kind of ‘revenge’ … is false and misconceived”.He told the programme that he had “funded research into whether he and his family members had been subject to ANL’s unlawful information gathering activities” but that he “has never funded research into illegal activities at the Daily Mail for the purposes of the present claims”.The actor Hugh Grant also told the programme that he funded Johnson’s research into rumours the paper had offered money to the Soham murderer Ian Huntley.He said: “In 2015 Graham Johnson asked me to help fund research into … reports that Daily Mail journalists had offered payments to Ian Huntley, subsequently convicted of the murder of two young girls at Soham.“If the research had established the truth of these reports it would have been a matter for the police, not the civil courts … I have never used the services of Graham Johnson, whether directly or indirectly, for evidence gathering for litigation of any kind.”Explore more on these topicsMediaDaily MailNewspapers & magazinesNational newspapersNewspapersPrince HarryDoreen LawrencenewsShareReuse this content"

Following several meetings with these families this year and after careful consideration, I have decided that in the circumstances a statutory inquiry is the best way to ensure they get the truth and accountability they deserve.”The trust has been investigated in the past for its history of patient deaths, but Streeting claimed these prior investigations had not been “sufficiently comprehensive” and that not all deaths had been covered adequately.In April 2024,the trust was fined £215,000for offences relating to the care of two patients who died by suicide at its hospitals. The Care Quality Commission, which brought the prosecution, alleged that the trust failed to mitigate the known risks the patients were exposed to after previous self-harm incidents.Andy McDonald, the MP for nearby Middlesbrough and Thornaby East, said the announcement of an inquiry provided “a huge sense of relief and achievement reflecting years of tireless effort” from him and the loved ones of the deceased.“The dreadful events that claimed the lives of three young women, Christie Harnett, Nadia Sharif and Emily Moore, exposed a broader cultural malaise at Tees, Esk and Wear Valley NHS trust and many more families found themselves grieving the loss of their loved ones,” McDonald said.“We now know that there have been numerous patients and families disastrously failed and it is imperative that every family affected gets to the truth of what happened and how the system let them and their loved ones down so very badly.”Alison Smith, chief executive of Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS foundation trust, said: “First and foremost, I extend my deepest sympathy to everyone affected by these tragic losses.“With the public inquiry now confirmed, we will fully support the process with transparency, openness and humility. Above all, we are committed to listening, reflecting, and taking meaningful action to ensure that we continually improve as an organisation.”Explore more on these topicsNHSMental healthHealthEnglandWes StreetingYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

The new map wouldhave favoredRepublicans in all nine districts. It would have accomplished this by carving up the Democratic-stronghold of Indianapolis into four districts and appending a slice of its voters to heavily GOP districts. It would have also split the congressional district in the north-west of the state, currently represented by Frank Mrvan, in two.State senator Greg Goode, a key Republican holdout on the bill, voted against the map, saying he was reflecting the will of his constituents.“I’m a Christian first, then an American, then a conservative, then a Republican – in that order,” he said in a lengthy floor speech. “I’m confident that my vote reflects the will of my constituents,” he said in a speech on the floor, according to NBC News.The push in Indiana came amid a nationwide push by Trump across the country to redraw district lines to add Republican seats ahead of next year’s midterms. Republicans currently hold a razor thin majority in the House and are expected to lose seats. Republicans, in Texas, North Carolina, and Missouri have all redrawn their maps to add Republican seats (organizers in Missouriappear to havesuccessfully deployed a unique legal mechanism to block the maps there).Democrats have retaliated by redrawing maps in California to add as many as five seats in their favor. Democrats in Virginia are also poised to redraw maps to add Democratic seats.Trump engaged in a bare-knuckled effort to pressureIndianaRepublicans to pass the map and vice-president JD Vance traveled to the state capitol multiple times to meet with lawmakers.“Every other State has done Redistricting, willingly, openly, and easily. There was never a question in their mind that contributing to a WIN in the Midterms for the Republicans was a great thing to do for our Party, and for America itself,” Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media network, Wednesday evening. “Unfortunately, Indiana Senate “Leader” Rod Bray enjoys being the only person in the United States of America who is against Republicans picking up extra seats, in Indiana’s case, two of them.”Indiana state Republicansfaced death threatsandswatting attemptsin the lead up to the vote.Vance andDonald Trump Jralso attacked Bray ahead of the vote on Thursday. “Rod Bray, the senate leader in Indiana, has consistently told us he wouldn’t fight redistricting while simultaneously whipping his members against it. That level of dishonesty cannot be rewarded, and the Indiana GOP needs to choose a side,” Vance posted on Twitter.Heritage Action, the advocacy branch of the conservative Heritage Foundation, also posted on Thursday that the state would lose federal funding if it did not pass the map. “President Trump has made it clear to Indiana leaders: if the Indiana Senate fails to pass the map, all federal funding will be stripped from the state. Roads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop. These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame,”the organizationposted on Twitter.Explore more on these topicsIndianaDonald TrumpRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

At least eight fire engines and two fire trucks responded to the three-alarm blaze.First responders took the half dozen injured to hospital. Their condition was not immediately known,ABC7 Newssaid.“We were sitting in the house and it just ... everything shook. Stuff fell off the walls and when we looked at the camera, it was like you were watching a war video,” resident Brittany Maldonadotoldthe station.Maldonado provided the outlet withdoorbell camera footagethat shows how an unassuming street was quickly overwhelmed by a cinematic bang and fiery grey cloud, followed by falling debris.Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) said they were told that a third-party construction outfit had damaged the underground gas line at about 7.30am local time while working.The crew was working on Lewelling Boulevard, which has been the site of an ongoing construction project to expand bike lanes and sidewalks, ABC7 News reported.PG&E said they went to this damaged gas line to thwart the flow of gas, which was let out at multiple points, by 9.25am local time. The explosion erupted 10 minutes later, per ABC7 News.Firefighters responded to the explosion at 9.38am local time, NBC’s Bay Area affiliatereported. Multiple buildings were aflame.The explosion and fire extensively damaged three buildings.

She is also invited to teach her class in a semester of her choosing.“I respect and appreciate Dr Nativ’s decision to settle this case,” Lyons said ina statement. “She is owed the apology I will provide on behalf of our campus. We look forward to welcoming Dr Nativ back to Berkeley to teach again.”Nativ sued in state court this year after asking the university to follow up on the campus report by rehiring her and taking actions to prevent similar future incidents. She said she received what she described as an inadequate response.At Pomona College, officials said they will hire a federal Title VI civil rights coordinator and create a “taskforce, committee or advisory council” on Jewish life and antisemitism after a federal complaint filed last year with the education department alleged civil rights law violations during the school’s response to pro-Palestinian demonstrations.Some Jewish students said the protests created a “hostile environment” for them and said college leaders did little to enforce free speech and nondiscrimination rules.The cases are part of broader allegations of bias against Jews and Muslims at colleges nationwide in the two years since the deadly October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel sparked fighting that has claimed tens of thousands of lives in Gaza and the Middle East region. Israel’s government says it is ready to move into the next phase of Donald Trump’s 20-point ceasefire agreement.On Tuesday, UC Berkeley announced a six-month suspension without pay of a computer science lecturer, Peyrin Kao, for alleged pro-Palestinian political advocacy in the classroom,the Daily Californian first reported.Explore more on these topicsUS universitiesCaliforniaAntisemitismWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Perhaps you, Lightning McQueen and Iron Man are all dancing together in the Mos Eisley Cantina.Disney to invest $1bn in OpenAI, allowing characters in Sora video toolRead moreSora is an app made byOpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT, which allows users to generate videos of up to 20 seconds through short text prompts. The startup previously attempted to steer Sora’s output away from unlicensed copyrighted material, though with little success, which prompted threats of lawsuits by rights holders.Disney announced that it would invest $1bn in OpenAI and, under a three-year deal perhaps worth even more than that large sum, that it would license about 200 of its iconic characters – from R2-D2 to Stitch – for users to play with in OpenAI’s video generation app.View image in fullscreenExamples of content generated by OpenAI's Sora with Disney properties.Photograph: OpenAIAt a time of intense anxiety in Hollywood over the impact of AI on the livelihoods of writers, actors, visual effects artists and other creatives, Disney stressed its agreement with OpenAI would not cover talent likenesses or voices.The announcement was framed as an extraordinary opportunity to empower fans.Think of the “fan-inspired Sora short form videos”, as Disney called them in a press release – akin to taking an AI-generated version of a photo with Princess Jasmine at Disney World. OpenAI included screenshots of these kinds of videos in its press release, indicating how the two companies expect people to use the app’s new cast. Sora already allows users to generate videos that include their own likenesses.Bob Iger, Disney’s CEO, said the licensing deal would place “imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we’ve never seen before”.They may even offer a chance at wide viewership, with some fan-made videos being displayed on the Disney+ streaming service, a move seemingly designed to compete with TikTok’s and YouTube Shorts’ infinite feeds, which themselves often include clips of popular TV shows and movies.Explore more on these topicsOpenAIArtificial intelligence (AI)Walt Disney CompanyComputinganalysisShareReuse this content"

It expects capital expenditure to jump by 40% to $50bn, with the bulk of the increase aimed at building datacentres.The company is managing a growing debt pile. Oracle’s long-term debt has surged by 25% over the past 12 months to $99.9bn. Even the cost of insuring its debt rose Thursday as investor confidence in the company waned.The business posted weaker-than-expected quarterly revenues for the three months to the end of November, as sales at its cloud computing business grew at a slower pace than forecast at 34%.Investors were also disappointed by a slower than expected 68% growth in revenues from its infrastructure business.“Frankly, the report was not dramatically bad, but it came to confirm concerns around heavy AI spending, financed by debt, with an unknown timeline for revenue generation,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote, said.Continued optimism about the potential for AI technology has led to aleap in company valuations in recent months,but there has been a growing spate of warnings from policymakers and business leaders who say stock market valuations could tumble if investors end up being disappointed by the progress or adoption of AI technology.Is AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcastRead moreOracle became an important tech player creating software for Fortune 500 firms around the world. More recently, it found strength in cloud computing, having become the fastest-growing competitor to Amazon, Microsoft and Google. The surge in AI has also been a boon to Oracle, which has entered lucrative deals with the likes of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.However, there are also growing concerns about howreliant companies are becoming on each other’s financingwithin the AI ecosystem. Oracle said overnight that its measure of revenue from customer contracts rose by 440% over the past year, but analysts were wary when it emerged that the contracts were driven by new commitments from Meta and Amazon.“Although these are two solid customers, it will not placate fears that big tech’s AI investments are becoming circular, which leaves it vulnerable to a loss of investor confidence,” Kathleen Brooks, a research director at XTB, said.“Overall, strong contract growth was not enough to placate fears about AI and the huge amount of [capital expenditure] spending required by companies to build AI infrastructure.”Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorStock marketsOracleSoftwareComputingArtificial intelligence (AI)Cloud computingnewsShareReuse this content"

And the message? Retreat to a McDonald’s restaurant until January and ride out the festive season.But the generative AI advertisement from the Big Mac maker’s Netherlands division sparked a flurry of criticism on social media.“This commercial single-handedly ruined my Christmas spirit,” said one user. “Good riddance to AI slop,” posted another.Artificial intelligence research has a slop problem, academics say: ‘It’s a mess’Read moreMcDonald’s Netherlands said in a statement on Wednesday: “The Christmas commercial was intended to show the stressful moments during the holidays in the Netherlands.“However, we notice – based on the social comments and international media coverage – that for many guests this period is ‘the most wonderful time of the year’.”Melanie Bridge, the chief executive of the Sweetshop Films, the company which made the ad, defended its use of AI in a post on LinkedIn.“It’s never about replacing craft, it’s about expanding the toolbox. The vision, the taste, the leadership … that will always be human,” she said.“And here’s the part people don’t see: the hours that went into this job far exceeded a traditional shoot. Ten people, five weeks, full-time.”But that too sparked online debate.Emlyn Davies, from the independent production company Bomper Studio, replied to the LinkedIn post: “What about the humans who would have been in it, the actors, the choir?“Ten people on a project like this is a tiny amount compared to shooting it traditionally live action.”Coca-Cola recently released its own AI-generated holiday ad, despite receiving backlash when it did the same last year.The company’s new offering avoids close-ups of humans and mostly features AI-generated images of cute animals in a wintry setting.Explore more on these topicsMcDonald'sNetherlandsAdvertisingFast foodEuropeTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m an athlete,” Collins said.But he said a CT scan revealed the extent and seriousness of his illness, which he said was a “multiforme” glioblastoma that was growing so quickly that he could die within weeks.He said that with the support of his husband, Brunson Green, and other friends and family he began treatment with medication followed by radiation and chemotherapy.He said his decision to pursue innovative treatment – currently at a clinic in Singapore – reminded him of when he decided to come out as gay.“I feel like I’m right back in that position now, where I might be the first person through this wall,” he said. “We aren’t going to sit back and let this cancer kill me without giving it a hell of a fight.“We’re going to try to hit it first, in ways it’s never been hit: with radiation and chemotherapy and immunotherapy that’s still being studied but offers the most promising frontier of cancer treatment for this type of cancer.Collins recalled that when his grandmother was diagnosed with stage 4 stomach cancer, she didn’t like to hear people use the word “cancer”.“I don’t care if you say the word,” he said. “I have cancer, but just like my grandmother fought it, I’m going to fight it.”Explore more on these topicsBasketballNBAUS sportsCancerShareReuse this content"

The blockbuster antitrust trial, explainedRead moreThe settlement came one day after the plaintiffs rested their case following eight days of testimony.“Nascar, 23XI Racing, and Front Row Motorsports are pleased to announce a mutually agreed-upon resolution that delivers long-term stability and creates the conditions for meaningful growth for all teams in a more competitive environment,” the joint statement from Nascar, FRM and 23XI.According to the statement, the financial terms of the settlement are confidential and will not be released.Jordan, the NBA legend and co-owner of 23XI Racing, also issued a statement.“From the beginning, this lawsuit was about progress,” he said. “It was about making sure our sport evolves in a way that supports everyone: teams, drivers, partners, employees, and fans. With a foundation to build equity and invest in the future and a stronger voice in the decisions ahead, we now have the chance to grow together and make the sport even better for generations to come.”Nascar CEO and chairman Jim France said Thursday the agreement suits all parties.“This outcome gives all parties the flexibility and confidence to continue delivering unforgettable racing moments for our fans, which has always been our highest priority since the sport was founded in 1948. We worked closely with race teams and tracks to create the Nascar charter system in 2016, and it has proven invaluable to their operations and to the quality of racing across the Cup Series. Today’s agreement reaffirms our commitment to preserving and enhancing that value, ensuring our fans continue to enjoy the very best of stock car racing for generations to come. We are excited to return the collective focus of our sport, teams and race tracks toward an incredible 78th season that begins with the Daytona 500 on Sunday, Feb. 15, 2026.”Nascar Cup Series driver and 23XI co-owner Denny Hamlin, after a long legal battle, said it was “worth fighting for a stronger and more sustainable future for everyone in the industry.”“Teams, drivers and partners will now have the stability and opportunity they deserve,” Hamlin said in a statement. “Our commitment to the fans and to the entire Nascar community has never been stronger. I’m proud of what we accomplished, and now it is time to move forward together and build the stronger future this sport deserves.”Bob Jenkins, owner of Front Row Motorsports, said he was “excited for the road ahead.”“After more than 20 years in this sport, today gives me real confidence in where we’re headed,” Jenkins said in a statement. “I love this sport, and it was clear we needed a system that treated our teams, drivers, and sponsors fairly and kept the competition strong. With this change, we can finally build long-term value and have a real voice in Nascar’s future. I’m excited for the road ahead - for the people in the garage, the folks in the stands, and everyone who loves this sport.”The settlement process began first thing Thursday morning in the courtroom of US district judge Kenneth D. Bell, who called for a one-hour sidebar. After about 90 minutes of deliberations, plaintiffs’ attorney Jeffrey Kessler returned to the courtroom to announce a settlement.“I’m pleased to say that the parties have positively settled this matter in a way that will benefit the industry going forward,” Kessler said.Bell thanked the jurors, telling them that sometimes parties in a trial need to see the evidence before realizing the wisdom of a settlement.“I wish we could’ve done this a few months ago,” the judge said in court. “I believe this is great for Nascar. Great for the future of Nascar. Great for the entity of Nascar. Great for the teams and ultimately great for the fans.”The flashpoint for the lawsuit was Nascar’s most recent charter agreement, which was handed to teams at the start of the 2024 playoffs with a firm signing deadline, following more than two years of fraught talks. Charters are the backbone of the Cup Series model as they guarantee entry into races and a predictable slice of revenue each week. 23XI and Front Row argued that the terms left them no viable choice. Both declined to sign, competing instead as unchartered teams with sharply reduced prize money. They argued that without a fair deal their operations could be forced out of business.According to the statement on Thursday, a condition of the settlement requires Nascar to issue an amendment to existing charter holders “detailing the updated terms for signature, which will include ‘evergreen’ charters, subject to mutual agreement”.Explore more on these topicsNascarMichael JordanMotor sportShareReuse this content"

But he has slowly started to prove himself at the Cleveland BrownsAndrew LawrenceThu 11 Dec 2025 08.24 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 10.03 ESTShareIt seems the goalposts are always moving on Shedeur Sanders, theCleveland Browns’ rookie quarterback who keeps throwing people off.He excelled attwocolleges to establish himself as a top NFL prospect, only to wind up getting picked in the fifth round of this year’s NFL draft in one of the mostdramatic stock crashesin league history. He then distinguished himself in training camp, only to wind up as the back-up to the back-up. When Sanders was finally pressed into injury relief duty last month and led the Browns to just their third win of the season, the caveat was that his breakthrough had come at the expense of the even-worse Las Vegas Raiders. Last week against the struggling Tennessee Titans, Sanders became the first Browns quarterback to throw for more than 300 yards and three touchdowns and rush for another score in the same game since 1950. But for many, the bigger headline was that he lost. Again.‘Dadgummit, let’s freaking go’: 44-year-old grandfather Rivers could start for ColtsRead moreEarlier this week Sanders was named the Browns starter for the rest of the season, inviting even more scrutiny of a an already polarizing player. His supporters say Sanders is entitled to his shot; his critics say he lacks the skills to play in theNFL, question his attitude and paint him as a spoiled rich kid. Every argument seems to excavate deeper feelings about Deion Sanders, his Prime Time father who paved the way for his son’s success. In the age of the nepo baby, Shedeur makes for a strange underdog story.There are expectations that come with being a starting quarterback in the NFL, after all. In addition to the requisite physical attributes and arm talent, the cliche dictates that quarterbacks are men ofcharacter– players who speak in the first person plural, deflect credit, absorb blame and lead with modesty. It’s how the quarterback position became shorthand for a standard of American leadership that was largely reservedfor conservative white men until recently. But Shedeur doesn’t even resemble the Black quarterbacks who have in the last few years broken from that tradition andtransformed the league. Instead, in character at least, he resembles his father. Deion is a flashy, brash and supremely self-confident two-sport superstar universally recognized as one of the best players in NFL history.After becoming the first Browns quarterback to win his first start since the team’s 1999 relaunch, a soundbite of Shedeur effectively congratulating himself for playing well despite his limited practice time overshadowed the more diplomatic remarks he’d make in praise of the team later. (“Imagine what a full offseason looks like,” he beamed. “It gets dangerous!”) When he was asked last Sunday if a botched two-point conversion attempt had worked during practice, he laughed. (“I don’t think you call plays in a game that didn’t work in practice,” he cracked.) After being criticized for his remarks in the media earlier this season, he was asked about the Browns’ quarterback situation.Sanders repeatedly answeredbygrinning and then silently moving his mouthin response – which had fans jokingly referring to him as Mime Time in a nod to his father.“We want our quarterbacks to be very, very humble,” says Louis Moore, the Michigan State history professor and author of The Great Black Hope: Doug Williams, Vince Evans, and the Making of the Black Quarterback. “He’s not that. He’s grown up believing that he’s allowed to have confidence in himself. The world beats down a lot of young Black kids, and Deion never let it happen.”The biased nature of the scrutiny on Shedeur, especially when things don’t go his way, often results in fans bringing up racism. They further speculate about Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski holding a grudge against the Sanders family because some far-fetched connection to Tim McCarver, whohad an infamous run-inwith Deion during the latter’s baseball career.View image in fullscreenDeion Sanders hugs Shedeur before Sunday’s game against the Titans.Photograph: Jason Miller/Getty ImagesBut the issue isn’t quite so black and white. Somehow, the Sanders family manage to inspire Obama-level respect and enthusiasm among Black Americans (who helped make Shedeur’s Browns jersey a bestseller) while also having Donald Trump in their corner. The current president hasn’t hesitated to cannonball into the Shedeur Sanders discourse, calling NFL owners “stupid” for letting him fall in the draft and trumpeting “I TOLD YOU SO!” on social media after Shedeur led the Browns past the Raiders. Trump couldn’t let those moments pass without making some mention of Shedeur’s “exceptional genes” in what was otherwise a forceful show of support.“I’m just thankful for [Trump] even taking time out of his day to speak out,” said Shedeur, reveling in his nepo baby status. While Peyton Manning was determined to overshadow his father Archie’s fruitless years with the New Orleans Saints and Bronny James shrinks from the allusions tothe more prominent Lakers playerin his family, Shedeur has been happy to share a spotlight with his famous father for more than a decade.A good chunk of his adolescence was documented on Deion’s Family Playbook, a reality TV series that ran on Oprah’s cable channel. Shedeur then played under his father when Deion coached at Mississippi’s Jackson State University and the University of Colorado, and the pair were instrumental in reviving both of those programs. Wherever Shedeur goes, there’s usually a camera following him – and oftentimes his older brother Deion Sanders Jr, the architect of the family’s vast online media presence, is the one holding the camera. Around family, Shedeur reverts from a football star to a little brother who gets razzed about his fashion choices and his position onhis father’s sibling power rankings.Being Deion Sanders’s son made Shedeur savvy to how NFL storylines are shaped, and the one he’s crafted about himself strikes the media – who are used to taking charge of the narrative – as presumptuous. He calls himself “legendary”, shrugs off brickbats (“You think I’m worried about what critics say?”) and throws words like “destiny” around when projecting his career path. Resentments linger about his starry approach to the draft process that may well have cost him the chance to be picked higher. It was thought that Deion was the one quarterbacking things behind the scenes at this year’s draft, but he has since revealed that it was Shedeur who may have rebuffed higher draft opportunitiesin Philadelphia and Baltimorebecause he didn’t want to sit behind two established starters, Jalen Hurts and Lamar Jackson – a pretty smart read as it turns out.“I know the fight behind the fight,” Deion Sanders said earlier this season. “I know what’s been transpiring behind the curtains, and I’m just proud of him. Because he’s not just saying the right things, he’s doing and living the right things. That’s just who he is … He’s a Sanders.”Shedeur has only played in four NFL games, two of those against bad teams, which is too small a sample size to make concrete pronouncements about his career. But his performances so far for the Browns, a team who have sunk the careers of countless quarterbacks, hint that he is dramatically better than his lowly draft position suggests. And while his chance to finish out the season is the first true vote of confidence he has received since joining the organization, there’s a sense that he isn’t so much playing for his Browns future as he is playing for the chance to thrive elsewhere. That’s because the Browns made a $230m commitment to the injured Deshaun Watson and are determined to see if they can get their money’s worth when he returns to fitness. With this season long lost, really all that Shedeur has to play for is trade value, pride and teammate Myles Garrett shattering the single-season sack record – but of course that’s the popular spin.For Shedeur, it’s just the latest chapter in a story that ends with him going down as the one of the biggest underdog success stories in sports – the draft afterthought who became an NFL legend. (Sound familiar?) That dissonance of an underdog with privilege shows the extent to which nepo babies have taken over the narrative.Explore more on these topicsCleveland BrownsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The prices drew a furious reaction from FSE, which said the minimum the most dedicated fans can expect to pay to watch their team from the first match to the final would be $6,900 (£5,137.74) – five times more than it would have cost to do so when the World Cup was held in Qatar in 2022. That figure could more than double once costs such as flights and accommodation are factored into attending a tournament held in Canada, Mexico and the US.FSE said: “Football ­Supporters Europe is astonished by the ­extortionate ticket prices imposed byFifaon the most dedicated ­supporters for next year’s Fifa World Cup. This is a monumental betrayal of the ­tradition of the World Cup, ­ignoring the contribution of ­supporters to the spectacle it is.“We call on Fifa to immediately halt PMA ticket sales, engage in a consultation with all impacted parties, and review ticket prices and category ­distribution until a solution that respects the tradition, universality, and cultural significance of the World Cup is found.”Members of England ­Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) were also ­astonished to hear of the prices from the Football Association on Thursday. The cheapest tickets for England’s opening match, against Croatia in Dallas, will cost $265 (£195) and are priced at a minimum of $220 (£165) when Thomas Tuchel’s side face Ghana in Boston and Panama in New Jersey in their other Group L games.View image in fullscreenEngland fans could buy tickets for the final of Euro 2024 for as little as €95.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianESTC members discovered that a semi-final ticket would set them back a minimum of £687, up from £508 to attend the quarter-finals, and £220 and £175, respectively, to go to the last-16 and last-32 ties. Those prices will force loyal fans to decide whether it is worth attending the tournament. By comparison, following England from the first match of Euro 2024 to the final with tickets in the “fans first” category would have cost €375 (£328) according to information published by Uefa in the autumn of 2023.Even tickets in the next category up would have cost a total of €860 (£753). Fans also discovered earlier this week that tourists to the US face­having to reveal their social media activityfrom the last five years, under new plans from President Donald Trump’s administration.FSE’s outrage was shared by the England supporters group Free Lions, which said on X: “This can’t be allowed to happen. Match-goers across the world deserve protection from these rip-off prices.”Thursday featured the opening of a random lottery for tickets opened by Fifa for the first time since the draw for the tournament was held last week. All fans, not just those able to purchase tickets through the PMA allocation, will be able to go online between now and 13 January and try to order as many tickets as they would like at fixed prices. Tickets sold in earlier windows have been subject to dynamic pricing, meaning they will rise or fall depending on demand.PMA allocations will equate to 8% of a stadium’s capacity for each match. FSE said that rather than adopting a standard price across all group matches, pricing appeared to have been calculated “dependent on vague criteria such as the perceived attractiveness of the fixture”.Fifa has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026FifaFootball ticket pricesWorld CupFootball politicsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

According to the statement, police were called to investigate an alleged assault in Pittsfield Township, a couple of miles south of Michigan Stadium, and took a person into custody.Michigan avoid playoff ban but face record NCAA fine over sign-stealingRead moreThe incident was not random and there was no ongoing threat to public safety, police said, and the person was jailed pending a review of charges by prosecutors. “Given the nature of the allegations, the need to maintain the integrity of the investigation, and its current status at this time, we are prohibited from releasing additional details,” the statement said.Michigan fired Moore for cause after the school said it found evidence of his relationship with the staffer, ending an up-and-down, two-year tenure that saw the Wolverines take a step back on the fieldafter winning the national championshipandgetting punished by the NCAA.“This conduct constitutes a clear violation of university policy, and UM maintains zero tolerance for such behavior,” athletic director Warde Manuel said in a statement. The announcement did not include details of the alleged relationship. Moore, who is married with three young daughters, did not return a message from the Associated Press seeking comment.Moore was 9-3 this year after going 8-5 in his debut season. He signed a five-year contract with a base annual salary of $5.5m last year. According to the terms of his deal, the university will not have to buy out the remaining years of Moore’s contract because he was fired for cause. One of college football’s biggest programs is suddenly looking for a third coach in four years, shortly after a busy cycle that included Lane Kiffin leaving playoff-bound Mississippi for LSU.Moore, the team’s former offensive coordinator, was promoted to lead the Wolverines after they won the 2023 national title. He succeeded Jim Harbaugh, who returned to the NFL to lead the Los Angeles Chargers. The Wolverines (9-3, 7-2 Big Ten) are set to play Texas on 31 December in the Citrus Bowl. Biff Poggi, who filled in for Moore when he was suspended earlier this season, will serve as interim coach.Moore, in his second season, was suspended for two games this year as part of self-imposed sanctions forNCAA violations related to a sign-stealing scandal. The NCAA added a third game to the suspension, which would have kept Moore off the sideline for next year’s opener against Western Michigan. Moore previously deleted an entire 52-message text thread on his personal phone with former staffer Connor Stalions, who led the team’s sign-sealing operation. The texts were later recovered and shared with the NCAA.Just a few years ago, Moore was Harbaugh’s top assistant and regarded as a rising star. Moore, who is from Derby, Kansas, didn’t start playing football until his junior year of high school. He played for Butler County Community College in Kansas and as an offensive lineman for coach Bob Stoops at Oklahoma during the 2006 and 2007 seasons.His coaching career began as a graduate assistant at Louisville before moving on to Central Michigan, where he caught Harbaugh’s attention. Harbaugh hired him in 2018 as tight ends coach. Moore was promoted to offensive line coach and co-offensive coordinator in 2021, when the Wolverines bounced back from a 2-4, pandemic-shortened season and began a three-year run of excellence that culminated in the school’s first national title in 26 years.He worked his way up within the Wolverines’ staff and filled in as interim coach for four games during the 2023 championship season while Harbaugh served two suspensions for potential NCAA rules violations. Moore also served a one-game suspension during that year related to a recruiting infractions NCAA case.Earlier in the 2023 season, Michigan State fired coach Mel Tucker for cause after he engaged in what he described as consensual phone sex with an activist and rape survivor. In 2012, Arkansas fired coach Bobby Petrino due to a sordid scandal that involved a motorcycle crash, an affair with a woman who worked for him and being untruthful to his bosses.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsMichiganShareReuse this content"

At Barcelona, Guardiola grew up amid an obsessive enmity on both sides, one deepened by his term as the Catalan club’s coach. They are highly familiar with Manchester City, too. City met Madrid for the fifth season in succession on Wednesday. DespiteMadrid’s recent strugglesunder Xabi Alonso,winning at the Santiago Bernabéuis a huge result, a deserved win where City might have been out of sight by half-time. Rodrygo scored his habitual goal against City but one of Guardiola’s new generation in Nico O’Reilly equalised before a controversial penalty award, converted by Erling Haaland, decided the game. A player linked with a move to Madrid sometime in the distant future celebrated with a smirk; Jude Bellingham’s attempt to distract by trying to yank Haaland’s ponytail did not work. After the selection misstep that led to defeat to Bayer Leverkusen, Guardiola got it right in Madrid to leave a lifelong rival in flux. In acknowledging an opponent wracked by injury and infighting had made for an easier task than usual, high standards came to the fore. “I’ve been here [at the Bernabéu] many times in the last five years and we have played much better than today and not won,” Guardiola said. He talks – and his team plays – like he has his mojo back.No Mohamed Salah, taking gym selfies back on Merseyside, but the Champions League continued to be a haven for Liverpool and Arne Slot. If you can’t find it, grind it? Pre-season hopes of a forward line costing over half a billion dollars carving through opposition are set aside in the hustle for results.Beating Inter at San Sirowas crucial for resetting the equilibrium imbalancedby Salah’s weekend outburst. “All I could ask for,” said Slot, an inadvertent victor of the Salah saga, maintaining diplomacy by concentrating on those players who travelled to Milan. “Only 14 outfield players available with Premier League or Champions League experience … tonight it should be all about the players that are here.” Slot reserved high praise for Ibrahima Konaté, who starred amid his troubled season. It was Dominik Szoboszlai who converted the decisive, if controversial, penalty. In a season of flux, Szoboszlai’s positive influence has been a happy constant.The English response toAtalanta’s defeat of Chelseawas to voice concerns about Enzo Maresca’s team’s wild inconsistencies. The broader, continental view is to appreciate the continued rise of the Serie A club from Bergamo. It was only last month that Ivan Juric was sacked after just five months in charge – marginally longer than the Croat lasted at Southampton – after a seven-game winless run in the league. His successor, Raffaele Palladino, has instigated a revival including successive Champions League wins, beating Chelsea following the defeat of Eintracht Frankfurt. Gianluca Scamacca, formerly of West Ham, cancelled out João Pedro’s opener from Charles De Ketelaere’s cross. While Robert Sánchez’s goalkeeping was suspect for the winner, De Ketelaere’s solo run had carved Chelsea wide open. “An amazing feeling, with the fans behind us, against the champions of the world,” said De Ketelaere, one of the best of Belgium’s new generation. Atalanta continue to be an admired nursery of talent who also deliver results. Even though the talismanic coach Gian Piero Gasperini is now at Roma, the 2024 Europa League winners are well-set for automatic qualification.Player of the weekJules Koundé, from right-back, notched two headers as Barcelona mounted a comebackto beat Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1, the first assisted by Marcus Rashford, the second by Lamine Yamal; the first time a Barça player has scored two headers in the competition. Other nominees include De Ketelaere, Arsenal’s Noni Maduekefor his double in Brugesand Ajax’s Israeli winger Oscar Gloukh, who also scored twice, against Qarabag, for his club’s first win.They said it“Thanks, Nicky ... shame on you,” read a banner displayed by Club Brugge fans during their 3-0 home defeat to Arsenal. It was a protest after Nicky Hayen, their popular coach, was sacked on Monday. “Not our club,” read a series of handmade signs. The coach who masterminded a league title in 2023-24, and the Belgian club’s fine showings in theChampions Leaguelast season, had been linked with the Celtic vacancy. His replacement, Ivan Leko, declaring himself a Hayen admirer, said: “The supporters’ banners? Honestly, I’m proud of them.”View image in fullscreenClub Brugge fans make their feelings known.Photograph: David Winter/ShutterstockThe pundit’s chairOn beINSports’s broadcast to the Middle East and North Africa, Ruud Gullit leapt to the defence of Jude Bellingham atReal Madrid, dismissing Richard Keys’s trenchant opinions. “He can’t play in the same way he could when [Toni] Kroos was there. When he and [Federico] Valverde are there, they have balance. Now it has to be another guy,” said Gullit, who claimed the Englishman was being sold short by all-star colleagues not tracking back.Keys responded: “He is an agitator, not a victim. He might be [a great player], but there’s a reason that Thomas Tuchel won’t pick him.”Gullit hit back: “That’s a ridiculous suggestion. He is the best player they have. He just wants to win.”Looking aheadNapoli meanwhile, are 23rd in the table, and play Copenhagen in 24th next time out. Antonio Conte’s Champions League record pales into insignificance compared to his domestic titles. “I know how much we have spent both physically and mentally,” he said of his side’s weekend victory against Juventus, in justification for the 2-0 defeat to Benfica in Lisbon.Is late-stage José Mourinho performing a miracle? Benfica, inherited winless and pointless in the Champions League, moved to 25th after beating Napoli, and he enjoyed a barb at his old rival Conte. “Saying Benfica were fresher physically feels like an excuse,” said Mourinho. Next up are another familiar foe in Juventus. Following that, Real Madrid. “Character and intelligence, a Benfica mentality,” is how Mourinho envisages his club reaching the knockouts.As for Juventus, their timely 2-0 win against Pafos came courtesy of Weston McKennie’s goal and a strike from Canada’s Jonathan David. McKennie’s brilliant effort was the 50th scored by a USMNT player in the Champions League.

That might rank lowly on the GOAT’s list of career achievements, but it was clear in the Argentine’s celebrations afterthe 3-1 win over the Vancouver Whitecapsin Saturday’s championship game just how much this meant. Even for Messi, this was more than just another trophy. This was a ‘mission accomplished’ moment.Double-post salvation gives Busquets and Alba a fitting farewell in MLS Cup finalRead moreFor Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets, it was a ‘game over’ moment. Both legends now enter retirement asMLSCup winners and as part of an Inter Miami success story. Yet the South Floridians carried Alba and Busquets in the final stages of their careers. Alba was a defensive liability and while Busquets lost a yard of pace a long time ago, the midfielder had the turning circle of the Exxon Valdez in 2025.This is where Inter Miami might get even better over the off-season. Amid the celebrations at Chase Stadium on Saturday, Jorge Mas revealed the club has replacements for Alba and Busquets lined up with former Tottenham Hotspur left back Sergio Reguilón reportedly on the radar of the MLS Cup winners.The way Inter Miami rolled through the playoffs to MLS Cup glory should shape the club’s transfer strategy for 2026 and beyond. With younger, fitter players around Messi, Javier Mascherano was able to set up his team to be more aggressive against the ball and more energetic with it. Find more of those players and lean into that approach further and there could be even more reason to fear Inter Miami next year.Have Celtic set up Nancy for failure?View image in fullscreenWilfried Nancy’s first Celtic game as manager ended in a loss.Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty ImagesWalking out asCelticmanager for the first time on Sunday, Wilfried Nancy might never before have experienced anything like the rousing reception he received from his new fans. After a hiring process that took longer than anyone anticipated when Nancy was first identified as the Scottish champions’ first pick to replace Brendan Rodgers, it was a deafening welcome. Against Hearts in a top-of-the-table encounter, though, those cheers quickly became boos in a 2-1 loss in which Celtic’s lone goal came in stoppage time.Tough baptism for Wilfried Nancy as Hearts land title blow on CelticRead moreThose boos were not necessarily for Nancy. He only two training sessions with his new players before Sunday’s match. But boos and general disgruntlement, verging on outright revolt, against Celtic’s board which has been blamed for the team’s struggles so far this season.Those struggles can be traced back to the summer transfer window, in which Celtic allowed several first team figures to leave without adequate replacements being signed in their place. (Supporters say the negligence goes further back than that.)Ultimately, close to €15m/$17.5m was spent on wingers (Sebastian Tounekti, Michel-Ange Baliskwisha and Benjamin Nygren) in a late attempt to salvage something from the summer. Nancy, however, doesn’t use wingers. His favoured 3-4-2-1 shape is already a talking point, as is his mini tactics board that was repeatedly used to communicate with Celtic’s confused players during Sunday’s match.Nancy has inherited a less-than-stellar squad. Worse still, it might be a squad that is ill-suited to his ideas and approach. Sunday was a bad start and it won’t get any easier against Roma in the Europa League on Thursday and St Mirren in Sunday’s League Cup final. He’s about to discover how this isn’t a normal job.Is Salah finished as a Liverpool player?5:26Arne Slot has says he has ‘no clue’ if Mohamed Salah will play for Liverpool again – videoMohamed Salahhad something to sayafter Liverpool’s latest disappointing result on Saturday and he didn’t hold back. After spending all 90 minutes of the 3-3 draw against Leeds United on the bench, Salah revealed his relationship with Arne Slot has broken down, and aired his belief that Liverpool has thrown him under the bus. “I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame,” he said in a seven-minute rant.It’s Mohamed Salah v Liverpool, and nobody is coming out of it well | Jonathan WilsonRead moreIt may have been something more deliberate than a rant. The last time Salah spoke to the media in such a blunt way after a match it was to twist Liverpool’s arm in contract negotiations. Salah, possibly guided by his agent, knew the leverage he had at the time and used it to land a new two-year extension.This time, though, Salah might have overplayed his hand. He has been a shadow of the player that broke all sorts of scoring records in thePremier Leaguelast season. Lethargic and disinterested, Salah has been dropped by Slot because Liverpool are better without him right now. If Salah’s comments were designed to force a choice between him and the manager, there’s not much recent evidence to suggest Liverpool should pick the former.Liverpool’s transition into a post-Salah age began with the offseason additions of Hugo Ekitike, Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz. Their integration so far has been far from smooth, but the true consequence of Salah’s comments could come in how they accelerate a process for Liverpool that started in the summer.Explore more on these topicsFootballMohamed SalahLionel MessiMLSCelticPremier LeagueLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This represented a 14th victory in their past 16 matches and it felt a significant one, too, given the pileup at the top of the table amid the scrap to advance automatically to the last 16 in March.Europa League roundup: Forest win late at Utrecht, Rangers lose to FerencvarosRead moreThen came an ominous message from Emery. “We can’t stop,” he said. “TheEuropa Leagueis very important for us – to be favourites, it depends if we are playing consistently, getting in the top eight. There are other teams progressively getting better. This competition is very difficult. But of course we are motivated, focused and we want to enjoy each moment, share emotions with our supporters. “That is what playing in Europe is all about. We have had those exciting moments in the Conference League, Champions League and now the Europa League. Three points today gives us confidence for the process.” Villa are third on 15 points after a fifth win from six matches, but only five points separate Lyon, who are top, and Red Star Belgrade in 17th.On the eve of this fixture, Xherdan Shaqiri, who returned last year to the club he first joined aged eight, insistedBaselcan beat anyone here. Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester United have all departed this stadium empty-handed across the past 15 years and on touchdown in Basel, Emery was quick to acknowledge that the Swiss side’s recent form also commanded respect.Basel had won their previous seven home matches in this competition, including two this season. Villa, of course, know all about the power of home form having lost just twice at Villa Park since August 2024; it has fuelled their surge up the Premier League and they return to domestic duty at West Ham on Sunday.View image in fullscreenEvann Guessand did well to control a miscued clearance and fire the ball past the Basel goalkeeper to put Aston Villa in front in the 12th minute.Photograph: Pierre Albouy/ReutersEmery, determined to add a fifth Europa League win to his CV, knows there is a balance to strike between this competition and the league, which remains the priority. Villa made eight changes from their stoppage-time victory over Arsenal, with Matty Cash, Ezri Konsa and Amadou Onana the trio to retain their starting berths. Emiliano Martínez and Pau Torres, who was forced off through injury last weekend, were absent altogether. Martínez was again missing with a back problem, which forced him to pull out of the starting lineup at Brighton last week. “It is not a big problem,” Emery said.Rotation equals opportunity and Guessand seized his chance on 12 minutes in scruffy circumstances. Marwin Hitz, the Basel goalkeeper, punched a Villa corner clear but Shaqiri’s clearance cannoned off the calf of an unknowing Philip Otele and Guessand, on the slide, showed awareness to locate the bottom corner to score his second Villa goal, both coming in this competition.Basel thought they had equalised courtesy of a crisp Léo Leroy finish approaching the half hour, but Dominik Schmid was ruled offside in the buildup following a review by the video assistant referee. Federer had to sympathise with a close call, commonplace in his previous life. Six minutes later, Shaqiri floated a free-kick into the box and Flavius Daniliuc gambled. So did Marco Bizot, the Villa goalkeeper deputising for Martínez, rushing from his goal towards the penalty spot, where Daniliuc flicked the ball into the net. Emery winced on the touchline. Basel’s Muttenzerkurve, home to their ultras, turned up the volume.View image in fullscreenFlavius Daniliuc enjoys his goal against Aston Villa that levelled up the game for Basel at 1-1.Photograph: James Marsh/ShutterstockVilla underwhelmed in the first half and Emery recognised as much, introducing one of his most trusted players in Tielemans at the break. He replaced Cash and Lamare Bogarde shifted to right-back. Emery has masterminded Villa’s turnaround from relegation strugglers to European regulars and perhaps he also has psychic powers. At this point, Villa supporters probably believe he is capable of anything.Just as it seemed Villa were huffing and puffing, Bogarde threaded a pass into Emiliano Buendía, who cleverly held off his marker and rolled a pass into the path of an advancing Tielemans on the edge of the box. On the move, the Belgian connected beautifully, coolly side-footing a shot low into the bottom corner before hurtling towards the pocket of Villa fans to celebrate. “Of course when we are winning, every plan more or less makes sense,” Emery said.Villa should have extended their advantage five minutes later when Jadon Sancho squared for Guessand on the edge of the six-yard box but the winger blazed over. Emery called for the cavalry soon afterwards, Boubacar Kamara, Morgan Rogers and Ollie Watkins entering from the bench midway through the second half. But ultimately Villa did not have to overexert themselves.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueBaselAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Nonetheless, these are worrying times for Wilfried Nancy andCeltic. Seriously worrying, in truth.Back-to-back losses since the Frenchman’s arrival would be bad enough without the rampant manner in which Roma ensured six points from six in visits to Glasgow during this season’sEuropa League. What a canter this proved from minute one.Celtic are a club with aspirations of being a serious force in Europe and so recently were.Roma, inspired by Evan Ferguson’s first half double, faced disjointed and dysfunctional opposition. Sunday’s League Cup final against St Mirren carries huge meaning for Nancy. He has to prove, primarily, that he can field a team that will play to their strengths. Nancy is operating in the most unforgiving of environments, where patience was thin long before his arrival.Classy Tielemans seals win in Basel to keep Aston Villa on march in EuropeRead moreRoma’s first visit to Celtic Park came a matter of weeks after they toyed with Rangers at Ibrox. Celtic knew they would face high level opposition. Indeed, a key challenge in this Roma season may soon be whether to prioritise a tilt at the Serie A title or try to combine the same with a proper attempt at claiming silverware in Europe. Gian Piero Gasperini has unsurprisingly fuelled hopes of glory.Celtic’s aspirations are lower nowadays. A crucial transfer window awaits, in which Nancy must try to rejuvenate a stale and imbalanced squad. Celtic should still be the favourites to prevail in Scotland but Sunday’s home loss against Hearts, Nancy’s first game in office, signalled the scale of the Frenchman’s task.Nancy is determined to do it his way. He stuck with the players and adjusted formation that toiled days earlier. Three centre-backs, all left-footed, were again deployed. If you were to be kind, you would suggest the midfield is fluid. Roma sensed vulnerability, with the visitors completely dominating the early exchanges. They were heavily assisted for the opening goal, when not needing it, by Celtic.View image in fullscreenWilfried Nancy cut a frustrated figure on the touchline in Celtic’s loss.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAKasper Schmeichel had cheaply given possession straight to Roma, triggering the attack which led to a corner. Matías Soulé whipped it in, with Liam Scales’s panic as Gianluca Mancini lurked meaning the centre-back headed the ball straight into his own net. Albeit comedic in arrival, the goal only emphasised the extent to which Roma had Celtic pinned inside their own territory.Reo Hatate was next to hand Roma a favour, the midfielder having his pocket easily picked 25 yards from Celtic’s goal. Ferguson should have doubled the Roma lead but cracked his shot against the outside of a post. As Schmeichel saved from the wonderful Soulé, Celtic were clinging on. Roma soon claimed the second, their dominance deserved. It arrived in blissfully simple circumstances, Soulé releasing Mehmet Zeki Celik on the right wing. Celik’s cross left Ferguson with little more than a tap in.Hatate scooped over as Celtic mounted something approaching a response but this was galling for anybody of green and white persuasion. Apathy rather than anger set in as Ferguson notched a Roma third. Soulé was the creator, finding the feet of the Irishman before Ferguson spun and battered the ball low beyond Schmeichel.An iota of salvation should have arrived for Celtic in the same spell of stoppage time but Arne Engels struck the post with his penalty after being fouled by Mario Hermoso. Nancy later admitted his players were “too soft” in the first half.Unable to make 11 changes at the break, Nancy opted for three. One of the replacements, Kelechi Iheanacho, should have reduced the arrears in the 53rd minute but shot wide when clean through on goal. Albeit Roma looked content with their lot, Iheanacho’s chance arrived in a period where Celtic at least played with structure.The former Leicester City man was more ruthless with his next opportunity. Iheanacho converted a low cross from Engels. The trouble for Celtic? The goal was chalked off for offside. It had long since been that kind of night for the Scottish champions.The Roma substitute Leon Bailey was denied a goal by an identical, belated intervention from officialdom. Thousands of punters did not bother to hang around for the VAR check, such was the state of affairs regardless. Nancy must have taken note. He is a coach in need of a sharp upturn in fortune.Asked afterwards if he had expected such a difficult start, Nancy replied: “I expected it. Come on guys, I just came one week ago. A few players played six games in a row, we have injured players, we have big games coming. So I expected that.”“I want to be positive, we have situations I can be positive about but tonight was difficult,” he added. “In the first half, we were too soft in certain moments. We have to be stronger. We didn’t cope with the intensity in the first half. The second half was better. When we raised the pressure we were able to connect better. We need to be closer to be able to connect and get forward quicker.”Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueCelticRomamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Having arrived in Dublin missing some of their big-hitters including star striker Jean-Philippe Mateta and the marauding wing-back Daniel Muñoz, they left with a comfortable victory that virtually assured them of a place in theConference Leagueplayoffs.Oliver Glasner has already said that he will play a weakened team against Finnish side KuPS in their final group stage match next week despite slipping up against Strasbourg on their last outing as Palace are in the middle of a marathon December in which they will play eight times. So it was heartening for him to see some of his fringe players shine, as Christantus Uche capped only his second start since joining on an initial loan from Getafe in the summer with a well-taken goal and Eddie Nketiah scored for the second game in succession.Europa League roundup: Forest win late at Utrecht, Rangers lose to FerencvarosRead moreAShelbourneside that finished their domestic season last month were no match even for a largely second-string Palace, who had only 15 senior outfield players available with Mateta and Muñoz sidelined by knee injuries. Uche ended the evening being serenaded by the visiting support but Glasner is hoping there is plenty more to come from the Nigerian.“One swallow doesn’t make a summer. So it was one swallow and it’s nice to see, but a few more I have to follow, then it will be summer,” he said.Quick GuideConference League: Aberdeen hopes ended by StrasbourgShowMartial Godo’s first-half strike was enough to earn Strasbourg a 1-0 win at Aberdeen in the  Conference League, ending the Scottish Premiership side's hopes of a playoff place.Dimitar Mitov made several excellent saves – including one from the penalty spot – to keep the home side in the game but they ultimately slipped to defeat. Godo got the winner against the run of play in the 35th minute, taking a touch from Sam Amo-Ameyaw's defence-splitting pass before finding the bottom corner.Aberdeen made a fast start, with Stuart Armstrong heavily involved. The former Scotland man intercepted a loose ball after 10 minutes and fed Marko Lazetic who saw his effort blocked. The hosts had the ball in the net after 14 minutes, Mats Knoester heading in an Armstrong corner at the far post – but a VAR check confirmed a handball.Strasbourg's former Chelsea defender Ben Chilwell was denied by Mitov, before Adil Aouchiche pounced on further hesitation in the visiting defence to let rip from the edge of the area, hitting narrowly over. Aberdeen had the better of the first half but went in behind after Godo's sucker-punch of a strike.Mitov flew across his goal early in the second half to deny Godo from a Guela Doué cross, then stuck out a paw to turn Godo’s deflected effort over the bar. Strasbourg had a great chance to double their lead from the penalty spot after 71 minutes, but Ismaël Doukouré saw his spot-kick saved by Mitov.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Thankfully there was no repeat of the unsavoury scenes in France when a minority of Palace fans werefighting among themselves before kick-off, although there was a banner behind the goal that read “Kick racists out of Palace”. Heavy rain in the Irish capital greeted the 1,800 who had made the trip, with the game being held at Shamrock Rovers’ Tallaght Stadium because Shelbourne’s Tolka Park ground does not meet Uefa requirements.This is the first time Shelbourne have reached the league stage of a European competition but they had managed only one point and no goals from their first four matches. Manager Joey O’Brien – the former Bolton and West Ham defender who took over from Damien Duff in July – had urged his players to embrace the occasion in front of a sold-out crowd that included his former Republic of Ireland teammate.It didn’t take long for Palace to establish their dominance despite the slippery surface. A flowing move in the 11th minute that was sparked by Daichi Kamada’s clever pass allowed Nketiah to lay the ball on a plate for Uche, who made no mistake with an excellent finish into the far corner. The lively Nketiah thought that he should have had a penalty when he raced into the area after being gifted possession but the Slovenian referee waved away his protests.View image in fullscreenYeremy Pino after scoring Palace’s third goal.Photograph: Sebastian Frej/Getty ImagesIt wasn’t long before his name was on the scoresheet as the former Arsenal striker tapped home from a yard out after Uche, who had been played in by Yeremy Pino, had struck the post. Poor Shelbourne were hanging on for dear life. Kameron Ledwidge was lucky to escape a booking for two agricultural changes on Pino before Chris Richards struck the crossbar from a corner.The game was in effect over as a contest eight minutes from half-time when Pino meandered past some comically weak challenges into the area and dispatched a shot past Wessel Speel, the on-loan Dutch goalkeeper.The Spaniard, Kamada and Adam Wharton were withdrawn for the second half as Glasner took the opportunity to give them a rest, with Will Hughes, Jefferson Lerma and Romain Esse replacing them. The latter almost scored with his first touch as Palace were quickly back into their groove but saw his shot blocked.Esse, who has been used sparingly by Glasner since he joined form Millwall last year and looked like he had a point to prove, was desperately unlucky to see one effort strike both posts before being gratefully clasped by Speel on the goalline. Uche should have at least hit the target seconds later but a glaring miss showed he is still far from the finished article.There were concerned looks on the Palace bench when Justin Devenny limped off late on as the 17-year-old striker Benji Casey was handed his debut on an otherwise perfect night for Glasner.Explore more on these topicsConference LeagueShelbourneCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

We were good in the game in the first half, a clean sheet, we make the good goal.

United’s revenue was £140.3m, down from £143.1m 12 months previously, and the club’s revolving credit rose £35.7m to £268m, with noncurrent borrowings remaining at £650m.Since Ratcliffe became the largest minority owner in February 2024, his budgetary adjustments have included making about 450 redundancies, which will take the head count to around 800. The Ineos chair has also ended Sir Alex Ferguson’s ambassadorial role, saving about £2m a year, andcut free lunchesfor United employees.Berrada said: “These robust financial results reflect the resilience of Manchester United as we make strong progress in our transformation of the club. The difficult decisions we have made in the past year have resulted in a sustainably lower cost base and a more streamlined, effective organisation equipped to drive the club towards improved sporting and commercial performance over the long term. That has helped us to invest in our men’s and women’s teams, sitting in sixth and third places in the Premier League and Women’s Super League respectively.”The club’s cash and cash equivalents fell to £80.5m from £149.6m and sponsorship revenue was £47m, a 9.3% decrease owing to the loss of a training kit partner after United’s deal with Tezos ended. It is understood productive discussions are continuing with prospective partners regarding training kit sponsorship.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedFinancesBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

How long can a positive reaction make up for negative results?Sid Lowein MadridThu 11 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 15.12 ESTShareNo attacker in Real Madrid’s history had gone without a goal for as long as Rodrygo but at last he was released and he had a message to deliver, performed for public consumption. The Brazilian, who had not scored in nine months and was starting only his fifth game this season, beat Gianluigi Donnarumma to give them the lead againstManchester City. Then he turned and ran towards the touchline to embrace Xabi Alonso, the manager on the edge for whom this could prove an even greater release.“It’s a difficult moment for him, like it is for us,” Rodrygo said. “Things aren’t coming off and I wanted to show people that we are together with the coach. People say a lot of things and I just wanted to show that we are united. We need that unity to keep going.” By the time Rodrygo spoke, the lead had been taken from them,another loss taking its place. City had turned it around, going 2-1 ahead with “very little”, Alonso said. That can happen when you’re in a “delicate” state, he added, but at least Madrid had reacted. This time they could not complete a comeback. Endrick, on as a substitute having played 11 minutes all season, hit the bar in the dying moments.Losing grip on games is worry for Guardiola despite City finding way past MadridRead more“It wasn’t enough,” Rodrygo said. The question was whether it would be enough for Alonso to keep his job. “We didn’t feel that [this was a trial of the coach],” Thibaut Courtois said, but that was how it had been framed publicly, and how it was felt privately: not an ultimatum as such, but not so far off. “We have shown that we’re with the manager: we have played well, given 100%,” Courtois said. And so judgment was reserved, sentencing suspended, pending Alavés on Sunday and Sevilla six days later.Madrid had been beaten at home for the second time in four days, taking their recent run to two wins in eight, but this was a little different. This was City,not Celta, for a start. It was not Elche, Girona or Rayo Vallecano either. Stripped down, simplified, they had actually run, the easiest and most damning accusation not levelled at them this time. With eight men out against a team Alonso called “top”, they had lost only to a scrambled finish and a penalty, almost salvaging something at the end. There were “a lot of very good things” about this performance, the head coach said, and there could be “no reproach” of his players this time.That was not always entirely true. There were periods in the second half, as the frustration grew, when the Santiago Bernabéu had whistled. At full time, some had repeated that, although there was some applause. But mostly, a quiet stream to the exits. “That’s normal, we understand it,” Rodrygo said. “We have been here a long time and we know what happens when we’re not good.” Alonso said: “It’s nothing that hasn’t happened before. And there were moments when they clapped too.” He also said sometimes “you lot [the press] paint things a certain way”, although he admitted: “The results are real, an objective fact.”View image in fullscreenReal Madrid fans whistled during their team’s loss but there was largely an indifference as they streamed out at full time.Photograph: Ángel Martínez/UEFA/Getty Images“I feel the support of the players,” Alonso said. And if he backed them, they backed him too, at least in front of the cameras. There has been a coming together, conversations: the coach had accommodated them, perhaps more than they had accommodated him, meeting somewhere not quite in the middle.How lasting a solution that is remains an open question. One little moment in the post-match press conference felt significant, even if it slipped by almost unnoticed. Asked about Pep Guardiola’s advice to do things his way, Alonso had allowed that idea to hang there, for those listening to conclude that Guardiola’s implicit criticism of Madrid was not entirely misplaced, when he replied: “I have a good relationship with Pep, we know each other well and he knows what he is saying. I don’t have to evaluate what he said.”Above all though, he could be satisfied that there was a resistance, a reaction. Madrid’s players had not let Alonso fall during the game and after it they defended him. Part of it may have been for show, done out of duty or self-preservation for players under scrutiny too, but in this context it was significant. So was the intensity with which they played – even if there is a risk of the most basic of standards somehow being elevated to a kind of success; even if the temptation might have been to ask:why isn’t it always like this?The previous day, Aurélien Tchouaméni insisted the coach had a plan, that their failings were not his fault. It was down to the players to have the intensity. “I think my teammate Aurélien said it in the press conference,” Raúl Asencio said after full time. “The only way is [for] the players to change the attitude. The attitude is the key thing and today we have seen a change. The dressing room is withXabi Alonso100%. The day-to-day at Valdebebas [the training ground] is very, very good.”Jude Bellingham, asked if they were behind the coach, also replied in numbers: “100%.”View image in fullscreenJude Bellingham said the players were prepared to work hard to turn results around.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA“We’re still trying to work it out in the changing room,” he said. “We know that the [outside] noise will not be helpful, so it is about trying to sort it out in there. As a player, seeing what we have in there, working with the coach, we have everything we need to turn this around. Maybe we just need a bit of luck. We have to talk about it. But I have faith that this season is not over just because we have been on a bad run of form. As players that kills us and we are trying to turn it around.“I think the manager has been great. I personally have a great relationship with him. I think a lot of the lads do as well. After the run of games where we drew a few [against Rayo, Elche and Girona], we had some really great conversations internally and we felt like we were going to [come through] the [other] side of that form [having won in Bilbao]. Then the last couple of games we just let ourselves down again. But no one is downing tools, no one is complaining, moaning, thinking the season is over.”“Everything passes in the end,” Alonso said.Explore more on these topicsReal MadridXabi AlonsoChampions LeagueManchester CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Across those fixtures, almost 48,000 bought tickets but stayed away.WSL talking points: Chelsea’s historic run ended to give City breathing spaceRead moreThere has been criticism of the empty seats, at Wembley in particular, especially after games announced as sell-outs. Why does this gap exist? Is the criticism fair? What does the Football Association need to do to start ensuring ticket holders turn up?England are, in many respects, victims of their own success. A high bar has been set by attendances since the 2022 Euros. Across the world, the attendances for women’s football in England – at both domestic and international fixtures – are envied. The second-tier WSL2 had one of Europe’s highest cumulative attendances last season.The US women’s national team achieved a peak attendance of 32,303 in 2025, for a friendly against Brazil at the 70,240-capacity SoFi stadium in Los Angeles. That was the only crowd at their 15 home matches to break 30,000 and only three others attracted more than 20,000 spectators.England had a cumulative attendance in 2025 of 302,238 across eight home games, with an average attendance of 37,780 and the final two games brought a combined attendance of more than 94,000 in four days.England have benefited from increased interest in the team in a Euros year but in 2024, with no major tournament, they had an average attendance of 42,770 from seven home games with a peak audience of 78,346 for afriendly against the USat Wembley.TheUS won Olympic gold in Paristhat year but across 15 games on US soil their average attendance was 19,269. The lowest attendance was 3,242 against the Dominican Republic in the Concacaf Gold Cup and the highest of 50,644 was achieved in a SheBelieves Cup game against Japan.View image in fullscreenRecent USWNT games have attracted lower than usual crowds in recent months.Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty ImagesAttendances in England are not to be dismissed, with work done unceasingly to grow interest sincethe huge surgefollowing the 2022 home Euros win. The gap between tickets sold and bums on seats is a problem, but a relatively small one in this context.On 29 November, the gap was the starkest all year, with 74,611 in a sold-out Wembley for England’s friendly against China. Accounting for tickets held for broadcast and operational reasons, a sell-out crowd is approximately 85,000.When you can see large blocks of red seats at a sold-out Wembley, it can be frustrating but for a friendly against a team ranked 16th in the world, the attendance was far beyond what many would have imagined even a year ago, with the national stadium usually reserved for higher-profile games against opponents such as the US, France, Spain and Germany.Had the FA not announced a sellout, which it has to do for operational purposes, there would probably have been little attention paid to those empty seats, but announcing ticket sale progress serves a purpose. As a game edges closer to being sold out it makes fans feel they don’t want to miss out, and if it is a sellout it makes them feel their ticket is valuable.Gaps between tickets sold and attendances are not exclusive to women’s football. For example, the men’s game between England and Wales in October was announced as a sellout but had a 78,116 attendance.There are many potential reasons behind the gap for England women games. Tickets go on sale months in advance to reach high turnouts, often capitalising on major tournaments and fans being on a high after other big fixtures. April’s Nations League fixture against Spain is on sale, with the FA hoping to exploit the festive period by enabling people to buy tickets as gifts. There is no perfect formula and the cost of sales opening months in advance is dropouts. The earlier tickets go on sale the more opportunities there are for people’s plans to change or for Premier League and men’s FA Cup fixtures to move and have an impact.View image in fullscreenEngland and Spain will meet again in April and tickets for that match are on sale with the Christmas market in mind.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/EPAThe low price of tickets also plays a part. A family of four could watch England against China for £40 at the lowest price point. However, if the weather isn’t great, there are transport issues, men’s games change and clash or something else comes up, some may feel they can afford to let their low-priced tickets go to waste.Affordability matters though. The cost of living crisis is an important consideration and surely some drop-off is a price worth paying for that level of accessibility to top football?An official resale platform could help address these issues but that would not close the gap fully. In each area the FA is searching for a sweet spot, but these are constantly changing as the game grows and audience tastes and expectations develop.The Guardian understands a cross-functional group in the FA is across this decision-making process, made up of people from the commercial, marketing, communications, digital, ticketing, events, finance and broadcast teams, with technical and team operations staff also involved. The governing body’s relationship with the Football Supporters’ Association is considered a key part of engaging with and understanding the audience for the women’s games.There is very far from a simple fix and it is not an issue being ignored. That the numbers through the gates are at the level they are, though, shows a lot is being done right.Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

It’s 3pm on a Thursday, you think, they’ve probably just been reffing a local game. Then, you think, there isn’t a football pitch around here. And why haven’t they changed and showered? Then more referees walk in, more linesmen, one of them in a comedy wig. And eventually the penny drops.Yes, “the Darts” is back: an indispensable festive trimming that – much like Christmas itself – always seems to roll around a little sooner every year. Fire up all the old cliches: “the beauty of set play”, “bent the wire”, “pressure the shot”. Wheel John Part out of the attic. Fingers poised on the 180 zoom. You know it’s serious, because it’s two hours before his match andLuke Littleris already on the practice board.Littler won on opening night, of course he did. Nobody will be too fussed about dwelling on the finer details of his 3-0 win over Darius Labanauskas, least of all Littler himself. But the Lithuanian can certainly be proud of the way he pushedthe defending champion, averaging 95 and taking the first two sets to deciding legs.Certainly there was little here to disabuse anyone of the notion that Littler is the overwhelming favourite to claim the sport’s first ever £1m prize. It took 23 years for Phil Taylor – a 16-time winner – to accumulate that sum in world championship prize money. This year’s winner could do it in the space of a few weeks. Even Labanauskas walked away with £15,000 for his first-round defeat.And in a way there has always been a kind of paradox at the heart of this championship: an event that somehow keeps getting bigger while also managing to stay exactly the same. This is the first year in which the field has expanded from 96 players to 128. Next year’s tournament will move from the West Hall to the larger Great Hall in an attempt to meet the voracious demand that led to all the tickets selling out in 12 minutes in July.View image in fullscreenFans in fancy dress enjoy the darts; tickets for this year’s tournament sold out in 12 minutes.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBy any barometer the sums of money at stake here are genuinely life-changing, sums that have gently warped the gravity of the sport. The prize money on the lower rungs of the tour – the weekly tournaments in regional leisure centres where most pros spend most of their existence – is handy, but still not quite enough to make a viable living.By contrast, a single run at Alexandra Palace can make or break an entire year, an entire career. Take the delighted Arno Merk, an amateur from Germany who has barely played on television before, whose first-night win over Kim Huybrechts netted him a cheque of at least £25,000. “It’s a hefty sum of money,” he said. “I’m definitely going to use it as a springboard and go full-throttle to become a professional. I’m not going to buy a car or anything.”‘It can be brutal’: Gian van Veen learns to fly with the stars after dartitisRead moreAnd so in a sport still defined by fine margins, these few weeks take on a more feverish, desperate hue than ever before. The highs can be supreme; the lows crushing. In the first week of 2023 Michael Smith sat atop the world, having tasted perfection in the greatest leg of darts ever seen. Two years later he lost his first match, at which point all the 2023 money also dropped off his ranking, instantly dumping him out of the top 16.Now, after a nightmarish few years in which his body has fallen apart and his ranking has collapsed, Smith is back. He comfortably saw off Lisa Ashton, the women’s world matchplay champion, 3-0 on opening night, offering hope of a happy coda to a year blighted by ankle injuries, shoulder injuries and chronic arthritis in a wrist that left him barely able to practise for more than half an hour. “The butterflies was bad this morning,” Smith admitted. “It’s hard coming the first night, especially if you get beat.”View image in fullscreenFans in chicken costumes are searched by security on their way in to Alexandra Palace.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianMichael van Gerwen is just one of the many pros who have been grumbling at the potential for outsized world championship prize money to distort the sport. “I don’t think the distribution is fair,” he said recently. “The world champion soon hardly needs to play any other tournament.” All of which raises an interesting counter-question: in a 12-month sport, has this show now becometoobig?One to chew on for the darts hardcore and the tour stalwarts. But for all the strides this sport has made over the decades, this remains its one genuine showpiece, its one cut-through event, and to an extent its rewards are simply a reflection of its status. And from the happy costumed throngs making their annual pilgrimage up the hill, you will hear few complaints.After all, if darts has taught us anything, it’s the value of giving people exactly what they want.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipsDartsLuke LittlernewsShareReuse this content"

They are joined in the six-person shortlist by Formula One champion Lando Norris, darts world champion Luke Littler and Masters championRory McIlroy, the bookies’ favourite.‘What’s my life like away from rugby?

For their club sides, Kelly was part of Arsenal’s Champions League winning team, while Hampton won a domestic treble with Chelsea. Kildunne, meanwhile, was the key player asEngland won the Women’s Rugby World Cup, scoring five tries across the tournament, including one in the final against Canada.At the age of 26, Norris wascrownedworld champion for the first time just last weekend in a dramatic climax to the Formula One campaign in Abu Dhabi. Still only 18, Littler started the year by becoming theyoungest world champion in darts historyand went on to complete the PDC Triple Crown, only the fifth player to do so. Finally, McIlroy has enjoyed two great victories in 2025, becoming only the sixth man to complete a grand slam of golf’s four majors after he won the Masters in Augusta. He then followed it up with 3½ points inEurope’s away victory over the USAat the Ryder Cup, despite being the object of constant abuse from the home supporters.If any of Kelly, Hampton or Kildunne walk home with the famous silver trophy of an old-fashiong TV camera it will be the fifth triumph for a female athlete in the past five years. There is even the prospect of a repeat of 1962, when the podium positions were entirely occupied by women for the only time in Spoty’s history. The winner that year was Anita Lonsbrough, a swimmer, who had claimed three gold medals at that year’s British Empire and Commonwealth Games.

On the other hand, terrestrial television has been crucial in boosting the prominence of women’s sport and, as BBC promotional materials note, the Euros final was the most-watched television moment of the year, with 16.2 million viewers across both BBC and ITV. Confirming the abiding power and influence of free-to-air television during “must-see” events, it makes one of the Lionesses’ pair much more likely to be crowned winners.McIlroy has confirmed he will attend this year’s ceremony, afterfailing to show in 2023when he suggested the prize “is not really what it once was”. He did not acknowledge his nomination on social media, however, and neither did Norris. Littler, Kelly and Hampton posted an image of acknowledgement on their Instagram stories, but only Kildunne added a caption: “Pinch me”.Sports Personality of the Year will be held at Salford Media City on 18 December, hosted by Clare Balding, Gabby Logan and Alex Scott. Other prizes set to be awarded on the night include Young Sports Personality of the Year and World Sports Personality. The shortlist for Young Personality comprises Lioness Michelle Agyemang, Littler andbreakout star of the Hundred, Davina Perrin. The World Personality shortlist includes the pole vaulter Armand Duplantis, themen’s footballer of the year Mohamed Salah, and baseball icon Shohei Ohtani.Explore more on these topicsBBC Sports Personality of the YearEngland women's football teamEngland women's rugby union teamLando NorrisLuke LittlerRory McIlroyFormula OnenewsShareReuse this content"

But despite that, and the man advantage after Liam Lindsay was sent off for dragging back Haji Wright when he was through on goal, Daniel Jebbison struck late to helpMiddlesbroughto move to within five points of the top.Lampard, the Coventry manager, said: “I am the first one to say that when we were 10 points clear and people don’t go 10 points clear in December and win this league. There is a lot to be done and it is important that the players stay level-headed and it is one game in which we played pretty well, and one moment was costly. I said to the players it shouldn’t feel like a loss but it does because of the standards and the way that we play.”Middlesbroughextended Kim Hellberg’s perfect start as manager with a 2-1 victory atCharlton. Boro were 2-0 up at the break after goals by Riley McGree and Morgan Whittaker. The Charlton goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski made a number of saves to prevent the visitors from being out of sight.There was a frantic finish when George Edmundson headed into his own net from Rob Apter’s cross with nine minutes of normal time remaining.View image in fullscreenMiddlesbrough’s Morgan Whittaker (second left) slides in to score their second goal at Charlton.Photograph: Steven Paston/PAJake Cooper’s late own goal deniedMillwalla fourth successive victory as they drew 1-1 withDerbyat Pride Park. Alex Neil’s side missed the chance to move back within two points of Middlesbrough despite opening the scoring in the 81st minute. Derby have not endured the best of times in front of their own fans of late – losing their last two – and Matt Clarke nodded Thierno Ballo’s cross into his own net to put Millwall in position for a fourth win on the bounce. But Derby were able to stop themselves from suffering a fourth defeat from their last five as Cooper headed in the second own goal of the contest in the 88th minute.Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney sell Wrexham stake to US private equity groupRead moreJaden Philogene’s exquisite curling finish gaveIpswicha narrow 1-0 victory overStokeat Portman Road. His goal, in just the second minute of the game, moved Town up a place to fourth spot as they recorded back-to-back victories while the Potters slipped to their third defeat on the trot falling down to eighth.Emil Riis headed an 83rd-minute equaliser to cap a stormingBristol Citycomeback from two goals down to earn a 2-2 draw withLeicesterat Ashton Gate. The visitors took a 17th-minute lead when Scott Twine saw his miscued clearance go straight to Stephy Mavididi and then tripped the Leicester player as he advanced into the box. Jordan Ayew hit the penalty down the middle to beat the diving Radek Vitek.It was 2-0 a minute before the break, Bobby De Cordova-Reid scoring against his former club with a low shot from 12 yards after Abdul Fatawu had got behind the Robins’ defence on the right and pulled back a pinpoint cross. The home side hit back a minute after the break when Leicester failed to clear their lines from an attack down the right and Mark Sykes fired low past Jakub Stolarczyk from a narrow angle. That sparked a tremendous second-half display by Gerhard Struber’s team, who equalised through Riis’s powerful downward header from a left-wing cross.Kieran Morgan struck with the last kick of the match to fireQPRup to seventh after a 2-1 win againstBirmingham. The Blues thought they had secured a point when Patrick Roberts cancelled out Jimmy Dunne’s first-half header in the third minute of stoppage time. ButQPRwent straight up the other end and Morgan, who only came on with four minutes of normal time remaining, crashed in a dramatic last-gasp winner. It was a fourth win from their past five matches for QPR, while Birmingham have now lost seven matches on the road this season.Tonda Eckert continued his impressive start asSouthamptonmanager with a sixth victory in seven games as the Saints held off aWest Bromfightback to win 3-2 at St Mary’s. The Championship top scorer Adam Armstrong struck twice before half-time to take his tally to 11 after Leo Scienza set the hosts on their way with an early goal. The Baggies put up a second-half fight through goals from Karlan Grant and Nathaniel Phillips and went close to a late leveller but have now lost their past seven away games.Returning Oli McBurnie helpedHullget back to winning ways as Phil Parkinson watchedWrexham’s nine-match unbeaten league run come to an end from the stands following a 2-0 loss. Parkinson cut a frustrated figure as Wrexham deservedly went behind to a Kyle Joseph effort, with substitute McBurnie – making his first appearance since sustaining a calf injury in October – wrapping up the win for Hull after Ivor Pandur saved a Kieffer Moore spot-kick.Sheffield United’s four-match winning run came to an end as they were held to a 1-1 draw at home againstNorwich. The hosts – whose starting lineup featured eight changes from the weekend because of “illness and injuries” – took the lead early in the second half with a goal from Danny Ings.

Ciaron Brown powered Oxford into the lead with a fierce strike in first-half stoppage time before Cantwell came off the bench to hit his fourth goal of an injury-hit season. But a draw against another side battling just above the relegation zone left Blackburn still with only one home victory all season, having taken just six points from 10 games in front of their own fans.Swanseasecured their second win in four days to ease their relegation concerns thanks to Liam Cullen’s strike to seal a 1-0 win againstPortsmouth. The Wales international swept home a superb effort from 20 yards in the 78th minute for the only goal of a tight contest between two clubs who have been in poor recent form. But following Swansea’s victory against Oxford last weekend it means the new manager, Vítor Matos, has delivered back-to-back league victories for the first time since April.Vivaldo Semedo’s equaliser in the seventh minute of stoppage time deniedSheffield Wednesdaya second league win of the season. Charlie McNeill’s third goal in two games appeared to have handed rock-bottom Wednesday a rare bit of cheer in a difficult campaign. But just when wastefulWatford, who missed a penalty through Imran Louza, seemed to have run out of ideas, Semedo squeezed a volley from Mamadou Doumbia’s cross under the goalkeeper Pierce Charles to salvage a point.PosTeamPGDPts1Coventry2029442Middlesbrough209393Millwall20-2354Ipswich2015345Preston North End206326Hull20-1317QPR20-3318Stoke207309Southampton2063010Bristol City2053011Birmingham2042812Watford2022813Leicester2012814Wrexham2012715Derby20-22716West Brom20-52517Sheff Utd20-42318Swansea20-62319Charlton19-62320Blackburn19-52221Oxford Utd20-71922Portsmouth19-111723Norwich20-111424Sheff Wed19-22-9Explore more on these topicsChampionshipCoventry CityPreston North EndMiddlesbroughCharlton AthleticQPRBirmingham CitynewsShareReuse this content"

But the Manchester City manager was clear that his team would have to raise their performance levels in the knockout rounds if they are to repeat their triumph of 2023 in the competition.It was a night when the pressure intensifiedon the Madrid manager, Xabi Alonso, who is fighting for this job after his team’s poor results continued. They have won only two of their past eight games in all competitions.Haaland seals Manchester City win at Real Madrid to leave Alonso on brinkRead moreThe plus point for Alonso was that there was fight and some good football from Madrid, who led through Rodrygo’s goal. But City turned things around before half-time with Nico O’Reilly’s strike and an Erling Haaland penalty.“This will be a good lesson for the future because that level is not quite enough,” Guardiola said. “I’ve been here [at the Bernabéu] many times in the last five years and we have played much better than today and not won. This is the reality. But yeah, I will take it. The reality is that in the latter stages, you have to do better.“Don’t misunderstand me. Winning at the Bernabéu is a big, big task. Especially in this competition. But at the same time, come February and March … the level required must be better. We will work on it. It’s not enough today. When we go to PSG, Anfield, Arsenal, we have to do better – but knowing the players we will be better.”Guardiola was asked whether he believed his team would be able to grow into the competition, peaking when it mattered in the knockout stages. “That will happen, 100% for sure – as long as there are no injuries,” he said.Alonso tried to remain upbeat despite the disappointment, insisting he sensed the support of his players. “Yes, I did feel that,” he said. “We haven’t lost our faith. With all the difficulties we are living with, such as all of the injuries, the players are giving until the last breath. That’s why I have nothing to reproach them over. The results are not what we want but we have to keep working and believing that things will be better.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityReal MadridPep GuardiolaXabi AlonsoChampions LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

It will place “imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we’ve never seen before”, he claimed.The deal is OpenAI’s most prominent move into Hollywood after a contentious rollout of Sora and longstanding pushback against AI from many entertainment industry workers. Concerns from writers, actors, visual effects artists and other creatives over AI replacing jobs and using likenesses without consent has led to union protests andcopyright lawsuitsagainst AI companies.View image in fullscreenExamples from an OpenAI press release.Photograph: OpenAIWhen OpenAI launched its latest iteration of Sora earlier this year, it immediately ran intoa slew of potential copyright issues, as feeds became dominated by videos featuring characters such as SpongeBob SquarePants or Pikachu – sometimes generated to appear in Nazi-like clothing.Racist depictions of Martin Luther King Jr prompted OpenAI to ban the use of his likeness on the platform, while the daughter of Malcolm Xcalled seeing her father’s imageon Sora “deeply disrespectful and hurtful”.Disney itself has also been concerned over the unauthorized use of its characters by generative AI platforms. The company sent a stern cease-and-desist letter to the Character.AI chatbot firm in October, alleging that the platform was “blatantly infringing on Disney’s copyrights” through using the likeness of its characters.On Wednesday evening, attorneys representing Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, demanding that the technology company’s AI systems stop alleged infringement, Varietyreported.The OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, has been on a charm offensive that included a recent appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, the US talkshow. On Thursday, he touted the firm’s deal with Disney as proof that artificial intelligence companies could partner with the entertainment sector.“This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences,” Altman said.In addition to Disney letting its characters appear in Sora, the company will also use OpenAI’s application programming interfaces to build new products and tools, becoming a major customer of the ChatGPT maker. A selection of the videos made by users on Sora will also be available for streaming on the Disney+ platform. It will also deploy ChatGPT for its employees, the companies said.“Technological innovation has continually shaped the evolution of entertainment, bringing with it new ways to create and share great stories with the world,” said Iger. “The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessOpenAIWalt Disney CompanyArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

It then became apparent that I was about to become the audience (some may say “victim”) of a recent cultural phenomenon: the Christmas wishlist slideshow.Don’t want waste this Christmas? How to give green and sustainable giftsRead moreGraphic design platform Canva seems to be the tool of choice for many teenagers. Canva say the first Christmas wishlist template was added to their library in 2019. Since 2022, people have created more than 3.35m Christmas wishlist designs. Presentation-style wishlists have jumped 61% between 2024 and 2025, totalling 1.4m. Social media is awash with videos of exuberant adolescents in expensive sweatsuits making family presentations on huge TVs, along with countless tutorials on how to make them “aesthetic” – a word I never tire of reminding my children is a noun, not an adjective.View image in fullscreenAn example of a Christmas wishlist presentation on Canva by Saga Design Studio.Photograph: Canva/Saga Design StudioView image in fullscreenThe Christmas wishlist slideshow phenomenon seems predominately led by girls.Photograph: Canva/Saga Design StudioSuffice to say it was not visions of sugar plums that had been dancing in my daughter’s head. Instead, I was treated to an initial collage of brands and stores that she holds in mysterious esteem, followed by a series of categorised slides covering the teenage perennials: clothes, jewellery, decor, beauty products and, thankfully, some books. While her slideshow featured images, “inspo” and prices, she refrained from the vulgarity of hyperlinks, which, judging by the online evidence, are a common addition. And, I guess, could be handy.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningIn my rigorous and highly scientific research (read: texting every parent in my contacts list) it was revealed that girls are the main perpetrators, usually embracing this nouveau custom in their late tweens before growing out of it a few years later. Many who were on the receiving end of these pitches appreciated the initiative and practicality, while at the same time lamenting the creep of bland online “get ready with me” and “unboxing” tropes into family traditions. As one friend, whose two boys had never subjected her to the experience, put it – it sounds a bit like people who spend too much time in office mode, then plan their camping holiday meals in an Excel spreadsheet.View image in fullscreenA letter to Santa from a Guardian staff member’s eight-year-old child.Photograph: Guardian Design/A letter to Santa from a Guardian staff member’s childEfficient? Certainly. But is it as adorable as the hand-scrawled, misspelled and glitter-smeared entreaties for Santa’s benevolence we knew and loved? Not quite. But as those sanguine mementoes of her innocence gather dust in a drawer somewhere, I was surprised to appreciate the thought, effort and moderation she applied to her newfangled approach. She even added some “dupe” options “as a backup”. Well-played, kid.While it’s hard to feel much seasonal magic emanating from a template-built pitch deck, there’s no denying it beats the look of thinly veiled disappointment when your best attempts fall flat. As my cousin said: “There are times in parenting when you just have to admit defeat and play by the rules of the new guard. God knows there’s only so much pity one can take from their teenager!”Armed with a mood board of colour palettes, preferred necklines, coveted cosmetics and (weep) a teddy bear, I told her, with confidence, it all lookedfeasible.Her eyes – how they twinkled! Her dimples, how merry!And there it was anew, that joy parents live for. Now, go to bed, please.Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleChristmasParents and parentingChildrenFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps you, Lightning McQueen and Iron Man are all dancing together in the Mos Eisley Cantina.Disney to invest $1bn in OpenAI, allowing characters in Sora video toolRead moreSora is an app made byOpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT, which allows users to generate videos of up to 20 seconds through short text prompts. The startup previously attempted to steer Sora’s output away from unlicensed copyrighted material, though with little success, which prompted threats of lawsuits by rights holders.Disney announced that it would invest $1bn in OpenAI and, under a three-year deal perhaps worth even more than that large sum, that it would license about 200 of its iconic characters – from R2-D2 to Stitch – for users to play with in OpenAI’s video generation app.View image in fullscreenExamples of content generated by OpenAI's Sora with Disney properties.Photograph: OpenAIAt a time of intense anxiety in Hollywood over the impact of AI on the livelihoods of writers, actors, visual effects artists and other creatives, Disney stressed its agreement with OpenAI would not cover talent likenesses or voices.The announcement was framed as an extraordinary opportunity to empower fans.Think of the “fan-inspired Sora short form videos”, as Disney called them in a press release – akin to taking an AI-generated version of a photo with Princess Jasmine at Disney World. OpenAI included screenshots of these kinds of videos in its press release, indicating how the two companies expect people to use the app’s new cast. Sora already allows users to generate videos that include their own likenesses.Bob Iger, Disney’s CEO, said the licensing deal would place “imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we’ve never seen before”.They may even offer a chance at wide viewership, with some fan-made videos being displayed on the Disney+ streaming service, a move seemingly designed to compete with TikTok’s and YouTube Shorts’ infinite feeds, which themselves often include clips of popular TV shows and movies.Explore more on these topicsOpenAIArtificial intelligence (AI)Walt Disney CompanyComputinganalysisShareReuse this content"

It was Broche’s appetite for risk and a few hopeful Reddit posts that would create the game’s world of Lumiere and its struggle against the Paintress.“I was doing like eight hours per day after work and not sleeping at all for a few years,” Broche says. And while he would be joined by Tom Guillermin on the programming side and Francoise Meurisse as producer, the next few members of the nascent studio – Lorien Testard, lead composer and Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, lead writer – would only come to Clair Obscur by chance, via social media.View image in fullscreenConcept art of the Gommage, the once-a-year event where everyone of a certain age is killed.Photograph: Sandfall InteractiveTestard, a guitar teacher at the time who had never composed or published any music commerically, was discovered by Broche on SoundCloud. “We liked the same philosophy in games,” says Testard, who had been writing music inspired by his favourite titles. Similarly, Broche found his art director, Nicholas Maxson-Francombe, through personal works he posted on ArtStation. “We are all deeply engaged in our subject areas,” says Svedberg-Yen, who says that was what bonded the team together. “If you listen to Nicolas talk about art or Lorien talk about music, it’s just something that fills our minds and our days.”Svedberg-Yen, meanwhile, had come from the world of finance. She saw Broche’s Reddit post and auditioned to not only write but also to voice some of the prototype characters of Clair Obscur, namely Maelle and Lune. Despite a deep love for video games, storytelling and a childhood engrossed in novels, Svedberg-Yen had not considered it as a career option. “It never crossed my mind as possible. As the adage goes, for Asian parents [it’s] doctors, lawyers, or finance.”With a rudimentary team assembled under the banner of a new studio, Sandfall Interactive, they rebooted We Lost as Clair Obscur. It was there a world took shape and the gained its unmistakeableBelle Époque setting. “There’s a specificity,” Svedberg-Yens says. “I think that vision gets diluted when you’re trying to appeal to too many people.”View image in fullscreenThe team of Expedition 33: Lune (Kirsty Rider), Maelle (Jennifer English), Gustave (Charlie Cox) and Sciel (Shala Nyx).Photograph: Sandfall Interactive“It’s not meant to be French propaganda,” jokes Broche, about the game’s very Gallic aesthetic. The characters yellputainandmerde, there are berets and extremely scary mimes not only because it’s fun, he says, but born from a desire to make something “sincere and authentic”.Same goes for the story. Clair Obscur’s narrative drives the game forward and, as lead writer, Svedberg-Yen says it all has a “grounding and a basis in truth”.“We are all first-time writer and game developers in this sense … and so we kind of only know instinctively how write to what instinctively comes from within. And for a lot of the characters in those particular situations, to write them [you] have to really delve into the parts of my life that resonate with the situation that they’re in.”According to Svedberg-Yen, a conversation Broche had with his mother became core to the story’s emotional heft. When he asked her what would be the worst thing that could possibly happen, his mother responded saying it would be to lose her children. “The story deals with a lot of trauma,” she says, and that process of writing like that was often a scary process. “If people don’t like it, they don’t like you.” It was this ability to be vulnerable and open a communicative environment that Broche believes contributed to the success of the game.Despite an anxiety in the industry about the rise of AI in the development of video games, the team at Sandfall isn’t worried – especially Testard, who composed the game’s orchestral score based off the narrative beats of the game and the eponymous concept of clair obscur (or chiaroscuro), AKA the interplay of light and dark. “Music is the language of the soul,” he says. In fact, the evolution of technology like Unreal Engine 4 and the later 5, which the game runs on today, made a lot of the game possible. “More games will be 3D, because we have a lot of tools now,” says Broche, who describes the budget of his game to be on the “lower end of AA.”The team at Sandfall have been overwhelmed by their success. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, lauded the game as “shining example of French audacity”. None of them expected the experience of Clair Obscur to resonate so deeply with so many people. “I’ve gotten a lot of very heartfelt messages from players who have experienced loss in some way and who have felt that the story helped them deal with their grief or change their relationship with grief,” Svedberg-Yen says.“What’s really cool is I’ve gotten tons of messages from creatives, writers, aspiring writers who felt creatively drained or just felt like they wanted to quit, but then the game inspired them to start again and they started creating their own art again, to start writing.”Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What it is not traditionally known for is honesty. I live in Los Angeles, work in the entertainment industry when I’m not moonlighting as a semi-reputable journalist and have done my fair share of lying … or, more accurately, omitting the truth. One of the least pleasant experiences in town is being asked to give honest feedback to someone who is at best an acquaintance. It’s worse yet if that person is a friend, lover or family member who actually takes your opinion seriously. Overall, the notion of offering honesty to a peer is akin to rubbing poison oak on your privates.And yet, despite knowing how gruesome this can be, I still solicit feedback on scripts, films and even nascent ideas I’m toying with. Naturally, I feel guilty doing it. I blubber about how gracious the person is for taking the time to engage with my creative output, how generous they are and how crucial this step is to any sort of actual success in the industry. I’m even lying when I say that to someone. I should tell them: “I’m sorry I just asked you to do the equivalent of punching several of your own teeth out for free. Please don’t destroy my self-esteem completely. Let my mother finish the job.”Look again at the Nuzzi affair. Because when our politics and media are so debased, the joke’s on us | Nesrine MalikRead moreWhen someone is brutally forthcoming with their true feelings about something or someone in Hollywood, it’s absolutely jarring. We all signed a metaphorical pact to never divulge what we actually believe, to always spare the feelings of someone who could speak ill of us later and to be, at most, highly passive-aggressive or sarcastic. I’ve lived here for nearly 20 years, and I like it this way. I used to imagine there was a level of success that afforded you the opportunity to opt out of the Hollywood social contract. I don’t know if Orson Wellesever had a nice thing to say about another person in the film business, but at least he was funny about it. As you know, he’s dead now, so he doesn’t have to worry about getting dragged on social media for calling Humphrey Bogart a coward. Quentin Tarantino, however, is very much not dead and still lobbing bombs at his sole discretion.The latest object of Tarantino’s ire is the actor Paul Dano, who, according to Tarantino, single-handedly ruined Paul Thomas Anderson’s masterpiece There Will Be Blood. Tarantino appeared on Bret Easton Ellis’s podcast and declared Dano“the weakest fucking actor in Sag” and “the limpest dick in the world”. He doesn’t simply dislike the man’s work. He thinks he is the worst working actor in America. That would include LeBron James, who is presumably a Sag member after starring in the Razzie award-winning Space Jam: A New Legacy. Would swapping King James for Dano as Eli Sunday make There Will Be Blood a better film, then? Only if there’s a scene of Eli dunking onDaniel Plainview.Since this is Hollywood, no one has come out and agreed with Tarantino, but numerous big names havepublicly supported Dano. This is far from the first time Tarantino has come for a beloved movie fixture. In 1992, Tarantinoroundly panned David Lynch’s Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Meafter it premiered at the Cannes film festival, declaring that “David Lynch has disappeared so far up his own ass that I have no desire to see another David Lynch movie until I hear something different”. That film was a notorious bomb that was booed at Cannes, so it was a safe opinion to have at the time. But today, Fire Walk With Me has been reappraised by critics and audiences, and is now considered one of the late director’s finest works. Whoops.Tarantino has been piercing the veil of Hollywood decorum for decades now, but it seems that he finally picked the wrong target. Dano is 41 years old, but has the cherubic face of a teenager who spends most of his time sorting Pokémon cards. You want to pinch his cheeks and ruffle his hair, then tell him: “Go get ’em, champ.” Making fun of Dano is like kicking a bunny at a birthday party. He looks like the counselor at a Lutheran summer camp. How can you hate that guy?Whywould you hate that guy? You’re picking on the quiet accountant who brings homemade brownies for everyone at work. More importantly, you’re breaking the social pact of the entertainment business: never, ever say anything cruel about someone who’s successful, even if you sincerely believe it.When a person violates this unwritten rule, they behave as if they are above the law. What all of this makes clear is that no one is successful enough to be honest, and that you can be an acclaimed filmmaker and still be completely wrong about art. I will go on lying, omitting and smiling when all I want to do is frown. If Tarantino can’t get away with it, why would I?Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going off to finish the third act of my Space Jam 3 spec script. I think Dano would be great opposite Bugs Bunny.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsQuentin TarantinoOpinionPaul DanocommentShareReuse this content"

Rousing himself to animation at the tail end of a televised 2 December cabinet meeting during which he sometimes appeared to be struggling to stay awake, the president disparaged Somali immigrants, many of whom are refugees from the country’s long-running civil conflict, as ungrateful and unfit for residence in the United States.“I don’t want ’em in our country,”Trump saidof ethnic Somalis, about 80,000 of whom live in the Minneapolis area. “Their country’s no good for a reason.” The comments echoed recent posts from the president’s powerful adviser Stephen Miller, who has largely taken over immigration policy. Referring to what he called “the lie of mass migration” in aNovember 27 post on X, Miller cast doubt on the possibility of assimilation, and suggested that immigrants from troubled countries would contaminate America with a kind of genetic or ontological incapacity for democratic governance. “At scale, migrants and their descendants represent the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands,” Miller wrote.Trump wants to recreate a white America that never existed | Rebecca SolnitRead moreIn the cabinet meeting, Trump went on to specifically disparage Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota – who came to the US as a child refugee from Somalia and became a citizen more than 25 years ago. Speaking of Omar and those like her,Trump referredto Somali immigrants as “garbage” and suggested that they were unfit for America. “We’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking garbage into our country.”“These are people,”the president said, “who do nothing but complain … When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don’t want them in their country. Let them go back to where they come from and fix it,” Trump said.He added, inaccurately, that “these aren’t people who work”. JD Vancebanged on the tablewith a kind of juvenile enthusiasm as Trump issued his bigoted tirade. At a rally on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, the president continued his diatribe,saying of Omar: “We ought to get her the hell out.”Trump has long been vocally racist, disparaging Black immigrants in particular in sneering and often vulgar terms. During his first term, he posited that the United States should not accept immigrants from what he called “shithole countries” – by which he meant Haiti and some African nations – and said that he would rather receive immigrants from Norway, remarkshe boasted aboutat the Tuesday rally. In his second term, his administration has radically reoriented American refugee resettlement policy, closing the nation’s doors to displaced persons from places like Somalia and giving preference, among the much-decreased number of refugee admissions spots, to white Afrikaners.For the Somali American community in Minnesota, the crackdowns have been devastating. ICE hasbeen targetingSomali immigrantsin the area;reportssuggestthat many in the community are afraid to leave their homes, meaning thatlocal businessesare suffering.And yet for all the seriousness of his rhetoric and actions, Trump’s racist outburst may be yet another sign of his weakness. Trump has frequently returned to racism at moments when he is on the political back foot, as he has been in recent months following persistently bad economic news, the repeated release of new information from formerly classified documents that highlights Trump’s former closeness with the dead child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, and the emergence of fractures within his own coalition as alliances break down and ambitious underlings begin calculating how to best secure their own futures after the end of his term.In such turbulent political times for Trump, white supremacist grievance, xenophobic sentiment and efforts to rally his base against a shared enemy have been a tried and true strategy. But they are perhaps yielding diminishing returns. While once – perhaps earlier in Trump’s time at the forefront of national politics – such racist comments could have provoked a news cycle of liberal outrage that served to stoke domestic conflict and satisfy the right wing id, now, a decade into Trumpism, racist comments from the president have lost some of their novelty. Even Ilhan Omar, the target of Trump’s ire who has faced serious threats to her safety after some of his comments in the past, seemed unimpressed. Responding to Trump’s tirade in apost on social media, she said, “I hope he gets the help he desperately needs.”Hate seems to be about all that the president has to offer his voters. With his approval rating continuing to fall, the economy still staggering and his own effectiveness waning, he is going back to the well of bigotry and resentment that has driven his previous successes. In so doing, he will inflict indignity and suffering on innocent people; he always does. But that deep well of white, working-class, popular anger that has served Trump so well in the past seems to be running dry. More and more, it’s Trump himself that people are angry at.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionRaceSomaliaUS immigrationIlhan OmarcommentShareReuse this content"

The bid is led by David Ellison, son of the tech billionaire Larry Ellison – a prominent Donald Trump supporter and Republican donor. Netflix had already prevailed over Paramount in a previous bidding competition for the purchase, but Trump announced on Sunday that he would “be involved” in hisadministration’s reviewof the Netflix deal. The president suggested the sale “could be a problem” because Netflix is already dominant in the US streaming market.Paramount left out a significant fact in thepress releaseannouncing its offer: the bid includes funding from the private equity firm owned by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, as well asthree Arab monarchies, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which collectively have billions of dollars inongoing venturesinvolving theTrump family business. Those details were buried in requiredpaperwork filedwith theSecurities and Exchange Commission.In aninterview with CNBCon Monday, David Ellison, Paramount’s CEO, argued that his company’s offer would face less scrutiny from US regulators because Paramount is smaller than Netflix and has a friendly relationship with the Trump administration. In the president’s transactional and often corrupt approach to governance, it also certainly helps that Paramount’s bid directly involves Kushner and the Arab petrostates that have struck lucrativebusiness dealswith the Trump Organization.Presidents are not meantto exert influenceover the US regulators who review corporate mergers, but Trump is disdainful of most precedents that seek to limit presidential power and he hasinserted himselfinto the Warner Bros negotiations. It’s also the latest example of Trump using his vast power to enrich his family and supporters through his personalized politics, where he blurs government and business interests. In Trump’s world, personal access is more important than institutional process – a system favored by many authoritarian leaders.Ultra-rich media owners are tightening their grip on democracy. It’s time to wrest our power back | Robert ReichRead moreKushner’s involvement in the Paramount offer is troubling because of his significant foreign financial dealings, especially with thethree autocratic Arab statesthat have invested billions of dollars since 2021 to enable him to launch and expand his private equity firm, Affinity Partners. (As of March 2024,nearly 99%of the $3bn his fund had at the time came from foreign sources.) After serving as a senior White House adviser in Trump’s first term, Kushner declined to take an official role in the second Trump administration,saying he wantedto focus on running his business and to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. But since September, Kushner has resurfaced as a high-level, yet unofficial, peace envoy for Trump, first helping broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and more recently at the center of negotiations to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.Unlike during Trump’s first term, Kushner has avoided becoming a lightning rod of criticism for the administration – and most scrutiny of his personal and financial ties to foreign leaders, especially Saudi Arabia’s crown prince,Mohammed bin Salman. Even though he does not hold any government position, Kushner has been acting as one of America’s most powerful diplomats, with a direct line to his father-in-law. And the deals Kushner is negotiating on behalf of the US government can overlap with his business interests, with little consequence since he is operating as a private citizen. For example, the Gaza agreement that Kushner helped broker includes a framework forpostwar reconstructionwhich will probably involve the three Arab states – Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE – that are the main financial backers of Affinity Partners.The same three countries, through their sovereign wealth funds and other entities,are now partof Paramount’s hostile takeover bid of Warner Bros. And Kushner is once again at the center of an international business deal that will ultimately require the Trump administration’s approval.Aside from pressuring regulators to take a hard line while reviewing the rival Netflix offer, Trump and his aides could tip the scales in Paramount’s favor in other ways: they can dismiss concerns about the Middle Eastern funds that are part of Paramount’s bid. Together, the three funds controlled by the Saudi, Qatari and UAE governments pledged tocontribute $24bntoward the deal, providing nearly three-fifths of the $40.7bn in total equity outlinedin Paramount’s bid. Normally, that would give these three players a majority stake in the new company – and would trigger a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, a panel of federal regulators that evaluates large foreign investments for potential national security risks.Paramount insists that the three foreign funds, along with Kushner’s investment firm, have agreed towaive their governance rightsin the newly merged company, including appointing board members. Paramount argues that means the arrangement poses no national security concerns and does not need to be examined by the Committee on Foreign Investment. But the panel, which is made up of variousgovernment agenciesincluding the homeland security, justice and treasury departments, can still decide to investigate whether the deal poses a threat of increased foreign control of US media assets.Several Democrats in Congress are rightfully raising the alarm about Kushner’s role in the Paramount bid and the potential for foreign influence, especially if the Trump administration pressures regulators to avoid evaluating the role of foreign funding. As Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee and a longtime antitrust crusader,put it: US officials must judge the deal “based on the law and facts, not who sucked up the most to Donald Trump”.Kushner is already involved in another foreign deal that must be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment. In late September, as he was helping negotiate the Gaza ceasefire, Kushner and the Saudi sovereign wealth fund announced that they had reached a $55bnagreement to acquireElectronic Arts, a US-based video game publisher that specializes in sports gaming. The acquisition aligns with Saudi Arabia’s recent strategy of buying global sports assets, including soccer teams and other franchises. But the Saudi fund’s previous investments in US sports prompted acongressional investigationin 2023 into foreign funding, particularly of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf league.While the Electronic Arts offer is supposed to undergo a formal review by the Committee on Foreign Investment, Kushner’s role is likely toease its passagethrough that panel and with other US regulators. And so far there is little resistance in Congress, aside from calls foran investigationby Warren and Richard Blumenthal, a fellow Democrat in the Senate.Beyond the involvement of Kushner’s firm and Arab states that do business with the Trump family, the Paramount deal appeals to Trump’s transactional interests in another way: if Paramount succeeds in taking overWarner Bros, it could lead to a CNN network that is more sympathetic to Trump and his Maga movement ahead of crucial midterm elections next year.Bari Weiss is a weird and worrisome choice as top editor for CBS News | Margaret SullivanRead moreTrump has made clear that heprefers Paramount, where the Ellison family is the largest shareholder, to acquire Warner Bros, especially if it enabled the Ellisons to control CNN, which has been a thorn in Trump’s side for years. Last month, theGuardian reportedthat Larry Ellison, who is often in touch with senior White House officials, had discussed firing several CNN hosts that Trump loathes, including Erin Burnett and Brianna Keilar.The Ellisons have already shown deference to Trump since they took control of Paramount over the summer, and began making changes to one of its main media properties, CBS. In October, Paramount bought the Free Press, a conservative news website founded by Bari Weiss, for $150m and installed heras editor-in-chiefof CBS News, reporting directly to David Ellison. Weiss, a prominent critic of “woke culture”, has led an overhaul of CBS News programming and teams,including layoffsthat disbanded the network’s race and culture unit.For the president, a successful Paramount takeover of Warner Bros could mean not only that his son-in-law and Arab allies are a crucial part of the deal, but it could also ensure that CNN’s parent company has a Trump-friendly owner. It would be a win-win for Trump – and a loss for democracy and rule of law.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsJared KushnerOpinionWarner BrosParamount PicturesParamount+CBSCNNNetflixcommentShareReuse this content"

And while it’s easy to pay lip service to the “four gift” rule – something they want, something they need, something to wear and something to read – I’m suggesting that, with the cost of living cutting deep and the festive spirit in short supply, we bring it into laser-like focus.In fact, I’m suggesting we target item number four: give a book to every Australian child and teenager.Including – especially – the ones who “don’t read”.Discover Australia’s top 50 children’s picture books as nominated by Guardian readersRead moreIt’s a truth universally acknowledged that a child who likes reading is given books all the time, for every occasion. But if a child self-identifies early on as a non-reader for whatever reason, people stop giving them books.What if we instead treat every kid as a reader, even if they haven’t yet found the right book? In doing so we make sure there’s always a book handy, giving them an opportunity to change their minds.And withAustralian literacy levels in the doldrums and recreational reading dropping across the demographics, it’s becoming imperative we change their minds.View image in fullscreenA child reads a book while laying on the floor at a library.Photograph: Jacobs Stock Photography Ltd/Getty ImagesBut how do you choose the right book?First, get to the heart of what they love. Fly fishing? Footy? Fairies? There’s a book, fiction or non-fiction, for every interest. The key to getting reluctant readers over the line is not simply giving them a book written for people who aren’t big on reading, but instead giving them a book they think was written forthem.Next, meet them where they are. Forget their age, stage and what you were reading as a child, and choose something for where your kid is at right now. If that means more illustrations than you think is “right” for them – a graphic novel, an audiobook, a joke book or a manual on how to tie knots – that’s where you need to look. Match the book to the kid, not the reading level.Make it fun! The festive season is not the time for life-improving literature (unless, of course, your young reader would relish that hardback edition of Great Expectations). If you want kids to open the pages, not just the present, choose a book that feels like a treat.Pair the book with a related gift, like a cookbook and baking equipment. Or a football with a related biography. A fairy house with fairy books, binoculars with a nature guide, art supplies with an art book, and so on. Immediately, the book has a purpose.There’s still time to ask your school’s teacher-librarian (if you’re lucky enough to still have one), your local independent bookshop or someone working at your local library for suggestions. Check in with friends and family to see what their kids are reading, and look for online sources of recommendations.Of course, it’s one thing to give them a book. It’s quite another to encourage them to read it. This is where the pairing idea comes into its own, but it’s also where you get to step in. If they’re open to it, read the first chapter with them; starting is always the hardest bit.Making space in their days for reading also helps. The summer holidays are a terrific time to create space, allowing for time when nothing much happens. And with thesocial media ban for under-16s, non-screen time (AKA boredom) will be easier to come by.The other important thing you can do is to open a book yourself. TheUnderstanding Australian Readers report, a collaboration between Australia Reads and Monash University’s BehaviourWorks Australia, found that role modelling encourages reading participation. In other words: read in front of them, read with them and make books part of your everyday conversations.A 3,200km tour of small Australian libraries taught me just how vital they are | Paul DaleyRead moreWithin my extended family, I am known as the Book Aunty – yep, books for every occasion.

Bonnie’s most effective way of advertising her X-rated content to the masses now is by generating enough controversy to get her publicly talked about, and she’s very good at making just enough noise (this time inthe Spectator, of all places) to drum up a bit of traffic.But to say that diversifying into hard-right politics makes her an outlier for her existing young fanbase is nonetheless an understatement, given Reform is now polling atjust 5%among under-24s. If Bonnie is selling something young men want, it ain’t her take on inheritance tax policy.What a lot of lost teenagers actually want from government, according to research launchedthis weekby the culture secretary Lisa Nandy, is heartbreakingly simple: a trusted adult outside the family with time for them (one in five can’t identify anyone who fits this category, with boystwice as likely as girlsto lack such a figure); something fun to do that gets them off the phones with which they have a love-hate relationship; a secure job; better mental health support.The national youth strategy unveiled this week was Labour’s attempt to reach out to gen Z, with a thoroughly welcome £500m investment in youth workers (to provide those supportive trusted adults) plus more youth apprenticeshipsand a review of what is undermining their mental health that may prove a lot more thoughtful than headlines aboutoverdiagnosissuggest. (I’d be very surprised if Peter Fonagy, the psychologist leading the review for Wes Streeting, doesn’t dig deep into the societal shifts affecting teenagers, from the pandemic to parenting, social media and academic pressures at school.) But it will take more than Keir Starmer joining TikTokto get all this across to young people, and more than this rather thin strategy to bring it together coherently.Like Bonnie, politicians live or die now by their ability to reach an audience increasingly getting its news from what goes viral on social media. Streeting instinctively gets the need for drama and controversial talking points, which is why his bit of the package is the one arguably mostly likely to reach gen Z ears. Reconciling the showmanship with serious policymaking, however, appears to be a work in progress.So here’s a talking point to consider, and it’s rethinking the generational contract between old and young. A report this week from rightwing thinktank the Centre for Social Justice, authored by former Tory MP Miriam Cates, argued forscrapping the pension lockthat has been boosting pensioner incomes ever since her party introduced it back in 2011, and investing the money in children. She joins a groundswell of rightwing voices saying surprisingly loudly what a Labour government daren’t: that too much of the welfare bill goes on elderly people, painfully squeezing what is available to the young.As young children, this generation of teenagers endured a lockdown that disrupted their education and kept them from their friends, mostly to protect the lives of elderly people. Now they’re trying to spread their wings in a world that won’t make space for them. They’re berated for not getting jobs even as well-intended rises in the minimum wage and in employers’ national insurance make them more expensive to hire, and nagged to get off their phones even when there’s precious little else to do. (Nandy’s research on the gap she is trying to fill showed a quarter of teenagers didn’t know of anywhere nearby offering opportunities to do something more sociable, from youth clubs to sports clubs to the kind of arts and music provision that councils have had to cut in the austerity years.) Bans on teenagers congregating in shopping malls and fast-food joints, often introduced post-pandemic amid fears about antisocial behaviour, froze them out of the few remaining places they could hang out independently with friends.Though Nandy’s new youth clubs are a good downpayment on a new deal for the young, tackling their unhappiness at the root will require less blaming them for their own troubles, more money, and more honest reflection by adults on whether as a society we’ve got the balance between maturity and youth right. If it takes a village to raise one child, then raising everyone’s children takes a country.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionKeir StarmerWes StreetingLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a Christmas miracleRebecca ShawIt is really satisfying to see beautiful, cranky lesbians take the lead in TV’s buzziest new shows, Pluribus and The Beast in MeThu 11 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 17.56 ESTShareIrecently went on a holiday for a few days and, as part of that holiday, I caught up on a lot of television shows. Don’t judge me, we all relax in our own ways! I looked at nature too! It’s sort of part of my job! (and other defences).I am someone who keeps up with new TV shows. I watch everything that is popping off – but I’m happy to admit that, as a didn’t-grow-up-with-women-kissing-each-other-on-TV lesbian, I will go out of my way to seek out ANY shows about queer people, especially if women are going to kiss each other.On my holiday, these sides of me converged in a way that has never happened before. I watched two very hyped new shows:Pluribus from Breaking Bad’s Vince Gilligan, about Carol (played by Rhea Seehorn), “the most miserable person on Earth who must save the world from happiness”; andThe Beast in Me, a buzzy hit where sad Claire Danes has to figure out whether her new neighbour is a killer. One is an alien apocalypse misery romp, one is a prestige grief-mystery, but they share one extremely important detail – the protagonists of both shows are lesbians (bisexuals I’m not erasing you, I just think it’s true).Coming from me, a lesbian of Some Bitch status, Bitch Lesbian is a term of endearmentWe have come some distance with inclusion of queer characters in TV shows (although it ebbs and flows) but it is very rare that we get a lesbian lead. So it is some sort of a Christmas miracle that I gettwoshows with a lesbian lead. But it’s evenmorerare that the two lesbian leads are representative of an important part of my community – Bitch Lesbians.I know that may sound like an insult, and it would be coming from many other people, including those online who complain about “unlikeable characters”, meaning women who don’t smile enough or have too many emotions. But one trash’s trash is another woman’s treasure.Coming from me, a lesbian of Some Bitch status, Bitch Lesbian is a term of endearment, a high honour that I have bestowed upon these characters. Both of them have good reasons to be misanthropic.Claire Danesis grieving the loss of a child. Carol has experienced loss and also the entire planet being taken over by aliens. But from flashbacks and general vibes, I have a deep understanding that, even before these tragedies befell them, they were Like That.Heated Rivalry: this horny gay ice hockey drama has everyone talking – but is it any good?Read moreThese women, in their very different stories, are both writers. They are both abrasive, frequently irate and, by the time we meet them, have closed themselves off from most people. While this sort of attitude is celebrated in male leads, including very recently –Eric Bana in Untamed,Mark Ruffalo in Task,Matthew Goode in Dept Q– the same characteristics in women make people uncomfortable. They are more likely to find the character unpleasant or annoying, rather than root for them.When it’s lesbians, we also have to consider The Trope. You know the one, it’s about how lesbians are humourless. We can’t take a joke, we’re unfriendly, we’re a buzzkill, and so on and so forth. Obviously I don’t agree with this, as I am a lesbian who can’t stop joking even when I should. I suspect the trope started because men in power and at bars didn’t like that loud queer women were willing to call their behaviours out and “ruin the mood”.Well, unlikeable and troublemaking to a man is a hot lesbian to me. It is really satisfying for us (me) to see this kind of character on TV, and it’s not one that we get to see often. Largely this is because lesbians don’t often lead shows but also, when there is a queer woman character these days, she doesn’t tend to be surly.Pluribus and The Beast in Me say that complex, cranky TV characters can be women and, what’s more, they can be lesbians. I love seeing members of my community on TV; a win for any of the LGBTQI communities is a win for me. I didn’t mean to rhyme but maybe it will catch on. But within that, I still wish for stories and characters as diverse as we are in reality. I want to see queers of all kinds; the strong, the weak, the rude, the kind, the funny, the depressed, the mean, the brilliant and interesting characters that we contain. But, for now, these two beautiful Bitch Lesbians will do.Rebecca Shaw is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsTelevisionOpinionSexualityLGBTQ+ rightsClaire DanescommentShareReuse this content"

This is what betrayal looks likeLarry ElliottIt’s a scandal laid bare. A stark new report highlights the price paid in Britain’s former industrial heartlands for this silent piece of ministerial vandalismThu 11 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 07.30 ESTShareThe Welsh valleys have some of the highest numbers of people claiming incapacity benefits in the whole of Britain. In Abertillery, Maesteg and Merthyr Tydfil, getting on for a quarter of the working-age population is not employed – in large part due to long-term ill-health. If the government was serious about reducing thegrowing welfare bill, it would be starting here and in the other parts of the country blighted by deindustrialisation and poverty. It would identify the parts of the country most in need – Wales, Scotland and large swaths of northern England – and love-bomb them.Yet instead of devoting more money to regional economic development, ministers are doing the opposite. In one of its less-publicised policy moves, Labour has quietly gutted the fund designed to create jobs, a scheme inherited from the Conservatives. The silent demolition job on regional policy is laid bare in anew reportby Steve Fothergill, national director of the Industrial Communities Alliance, an umbrella group for the local authorities worst affected by the hollowing out of Britain’s industrial base and the closure of the coalfields.Fothergill notes that for almost a century, governments of all political stripes have pumped money into the less prosperous parts of the country in attempts to boost local economies and cut unemployment. That support has now been largely removed. “The remarkable thing about the demolition of regional policy is that it has never been a deliberate political decision,” Fothergill says. “Rather, it is an outcome that has developed incrementally over a decade, involving decisions by both Conservative andLabourgovernments that for reasons at the time probably seemed pragmatic. It’s the cumulative effect of these decisions that’s now so worrying for the less prosperous parts of Britain.”The problems began when the Conservatives abolished assisted areas – regions of the UK that were eligible for special help because of their needs. The post-Brexit subsidy rules treat all parts of Britain equally. There is therefore no longer any discrimination in favour of business investment in the less prosperous parts of the country, which is why the new Jaguar Land Rover battery factoryis being built in Somerset, rather than Wales.In opposition, Labour opposed the abolition of assisted area status. In government, it has made no move towards restoring it. Even worse, it has cut regional economic spending heavily. The figures are stark. When Britain left the EU, the Conservatives set up a UK shared prosperity fund to ensure that support for hard-pressed areas was maintained. This commitment lasted for three years and ended in 2024-25. In her 2024 budget, Rachel Reeves reduced the UK shared prosperity fund for 2025-26 from £1.5b to £900m – a cut of 40%.The shared prosperity fund has now been replaced by local growth funds, but these have a much reduced financial firepower. Compared with the scheme for 2024-25, funding for England andScotlandfrom 2026 is down 76%, while for Wales there is a cut of 50%.The government may say that its entire economic strategy is driven by the quest for faster growth, and that all regions will benefit. Yet all governments in the past century have wished for faster growth and have still found the need for regional assistance. A rising tide may lift all boats, but some boats are lifted higher than others. Nor, without meaning to sound churlish, is there much evidence that Labour’s growth strategy is delivering. The economy is currently moving sideways, and unemployment is rising.To be fair, the much-reduced support for the local growth fund is being offset by a more generous settlement for local authorities – not just in England, but in the devolved administrations of Scotland,Walesand Northern Ireland as well. Yet the pressures on councils are so great that the extra money is almost certain to be spent on adult social care and children’s services, rather than on job creation.Nor are the government’s new neighbourhood initiatives – named Pride in Place – a substitute for regional policy. They are simply not big enough to have a real impact on jobs and growth. Money to spruce up rundown high streets is all very well, but it fails to deal with the issue of why those high streets are rundown in the first place.The real question is whether there is a point to regional policy at all. If the north-south divide is now wider than it was in the 1930s, isn’t there some rationale for giving up on the idea altogether?Local authorities in England and Wales warn finances at ‘breaking point’Read moreThe answer to that is no. Regional policy has boosted output and created jobs in the less prosperous parts of Britain. It has been swimming against the tide of long-term decline in sectors such as textiles, shipbuilding and coalmining, but had governments not discriminated in favour of some areas over others, the damage would have been far worse. The fact that on some measures London ismore than two and a half timesas prosperous as Wales argues for a more, not less, vigorous regional policy.Post-Brexit there is nothing to stop a UK government developing a more expansive regional policy – and Labour should take advantage of this freedom to bring back assisted areas status and make it more widely available. As things stand, the aid regime designed to boost struggling regional economies is a lot less generous than it was when Britain was in the EU.There may be a political price to pay for that. Seats in Britain’s old industrial heartlands were once Labour fiefdoms but are now very much in play, as next year’s elections in Scotland and Wales will show.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEconomic policyOpinionLabourWalesScotlandNorth of EnglandNorth-south dividecommentShareReuse this content"

People no longer want Brexit triumphalism, but things that actually workThu 11 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 08.01 ESTShareWhat’s in a name? A government minister has a good answer for Shakespeare’s question. “Names aren’t just convenient labels for people, places and things. They come with expectations,” the minister said. “Countries don’t normally have these pressures. But Great Britain? It’s quite a name to live up to.”The words are from the opening of Great Britain? How We Get Our Future Back,publishedlast year by the Labour MP Torsten Bell, now a Treasury minister. Bell’s book is about why this country is, and feels, broken. But it is also spot on about this country’s enduring naming problem. As Bell puts it: “What began as a statement about our geography has become one about our quality.”This may seem merely semantic. It is not. Great Britain may have been originally so described because of its relative size, not from any claim of superiority. But the name has slowly acquired some of these more pretentious associations. Particularly in recent times, governments have actively tried to promote the idea of distinctive British greatness. This deliberate freighting matters. It does this country, and the effort to rebuild trust in politics, few favours.On Monday, the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander,unveiled the logoand colourful livery of Great British Railways, the renationalised rail system that will soon replace the fragmented and privatised network that has existed since 1997. There are positives in the new structure, and even the new look. The name, though, is definitely not one of them.The name Great British Railways is puffed-up, misleading, tin-eared and backward-looking. It is puffed-up because, despite the purely geographical origin of the words Great Britain, the name sounds boastful for no reason. It is misleading because the railways are not great; tin-eared because the public is not so easily deceived; and backward-looking because it panders to a version of this country that no longer exists. Everyone knows it is a nonsense.But the rail rebranding is not alone. Keir Starmer’s government has a fondness for Great British namings. As well as Great British Railways, it is also bequeathing Great British Energy, the publicly owned clean energy company that was briefly Starmer’s flagship national infrastructure project back when Labour was in opposition. If other industries require public rescue, new candidates may follow. Great British Water, anyone?Institutions matter. They provide stability to a nation-state and, just as important, a sense of order. But that vital task cannot be wished into existence by a rebranding exercise. It is one reason why the right name is important. British Railways, as the rail system was known after nationalisation in 1948, was a good name at the time, because it was exactly what it said on the tin. The same was still true after it began calling itself British Rail in 1965.None of this should in any way imply that such institutions are so important they should never be reformed. Not a bit of it. One big reason why no government today would dare go back to using the otherwise-obvious name of British Railways is that the 1948 system became associated, unfairly or not, with a resistance to modernisation and efficiency. Calling it British Railways would suggest a naive reversion to an unlamented past.Yet the naming of Great British Railways is also silly for two serious reasons. The first is that it is a hollow Brexit-era conceit in what is now an increasingly post-Brexit era, with which it obviously jars. The second is that greatness and Britain have a particularly strong, although not universal, resonance in England, but are not echoed to the same degree in Britain’s devolved nations.In 2011 David Camerontried to rebrandBritish global soft power in terms of supposed “great” businesses, creativity, entrepreneurialism and assorted other “great” qualities. After the Brexit vote, this drive became more bombastic. Boris Johnson won the Conservative leadership with what he dubbed “a vision of Britain as the greatest place on Earth”. The “great” effort was then relaunched in time for the G7 and Cop26 meetings chaired by Johnson. Ever keen to jump on a bandwagon, the then-Tory transport secretary Grant Shapps promised a new public body in 2021 to replace Network Rail under the name Great British Railways.Labour has now adopted that same name for its own rail plans. The effort is misplaced. The public does not regard Brexit-era national triumphalism or ersatz Johnsonism as the key to restoring the railways or the energy supply industry. It wants things that work efficiently, are well-run and provide good value. To brand the renationalised rail system as “great” takes the public for fools. For a government that needs all the friends it can get, this is a mistake.But it is also a mistake because there is a missed opportunity. This government wants to show that the United Kingdom can still deliver for its nations and regions. It is right to try. But it would have a rather better chance of achieving it if, instead of pretending to restore lost British greatness as Johnson did, Labour instead saw such infrastructure and utilities issues within a framework of a strengthened UK that works with the devolved nations.Merely to rebrand major projects as Railways UK or Energy UK would not, of course, be sufficient. It would certainly not be enough to save Labour from its likely defeats by the nationalist parties in the May 2026 elections. But it would provide a much clearer institutional framework within which to try. It would give more intellectual and political coherence to the changes that are needed in so many places in the UK. Get it right, and the results might actually be great.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsRail transportOpinionTransportInfrastructurecommentShareReuse this content"

This is the question we must urgently reckon withMunira WilsonNo parent should worry about their child’s safety while they work. But a crisis in our early-years sector is shielding predators such as Vincent ChanThu 11 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 03.33 ESTShareIremember those initial heart-wrenching days and weeks leaving my daughter, aged nine months, at the nursery. She was distraught as I left, and I – like so many parents – headed off to work feeling guilty for leaving her, wondering if I was doing the right thing. Every parent does the research and nursery visits, reads the Ofsted reports and assumes that the staff in their chosen nursery will have the necessary qualifications and training to take care of their child. Obviously, there will be hiccups along the way, but never in your wildest nightmares do you think your child might be physically – or worse still, sexually – abused.Yet theharrowing case of Vincent Chan, a former nursery worker in Camden, north London, who pleaded guilty to nine counts of sexual assault and 17 counts of taking or making indecent photos of children, hit the headlines last week, leaving parents with young children across the country feeling physically sick and asking the question: How did this happen? Tragically, this is not an isolated case.In September,Roksana Leckawas sentenced to eight years in prison for 21 counts of child cruelty at Riverside Nursery in Twickenham Green and a nursery in Hounslow. Last year, Kate Roughley was jailed for manslaughter following neglect of baby Gigi Meehan at a nursery in Cheadle, Greater Manchester. The BBC’s Panorama investigation exposed a litany of cases of poor care and neglect in nurseries across the country.No parent should be left worrying about the safety of their child as they head off for a day’s work. No child should be subject to abuse that could have lifelong implications. And yet, too many children have experienced abuse at the hands of those we were told to trust. How have we got here?Expanding entitlement to“free” childcare provisionto more families has, in the words of somesector leaders,led to a “race to the bottom”. These places have been consistently underfunded by government, leaving childcare providers to fill the gaps. Some told me they’re now dealing with “crowd management” – as opposed to providing quality care. Minimum wage, long hours and an under-appreciation for the role have fuelled a recruitment and retention crisis that leaves good staff burnt out. With such a high turnover, providers are then hesitant to invest in staff who may leave after only a few months.The Department for Education’s ownreporton hiring incentives, published in October, noted that many candidates for early-years roles lacked relevant qualifications, provided no evidence of soft skills and demonstrated little interest in the role or a desire to work in early years. If many staff don’t care about the children they’re working with, how can we hope for them to identify concerning behaviours before it’s too late?CCTV footage was pivotalto securing convictions in both the Cheadle andTwickenham cases. In the Camden case, it is unclear whether CCTV footage was in use at the time of Chan’s offences, but if it had been, it would have been wiped by the time his offences came to light. Now is the time to mandate the use of CCTV in nurseries, with clear guidance that the footage should be regularly reviewed by management and form part of Ofsted inspections.Yes, of course, there are always privacy concerns, but no parent I have ever spoken to would put their baby’s privacy over their safety. Babies cannot communicate when harm is being done to them, so it is crucial we have regularly monitored CCTV to ensure neglect and abuse are not taking place. It could also provide a helpful tool for staff training.The Australian government isnow piloting CCTVin nurseries, alongside a register of early-years practitioners. A register would ensure staff qualifications, training and previous history are tracked. Shockingly, the Twickenham Green parents only discovered during the course of the trial that Lecka lacked relevant qualifications and that red flags had been raised in relation to her behaviour at a previous nursery in which she had worked.Ensuring that Ofsted has the powers and the resources to inspect nursery chain providers is another area that government needs to focus on. While the government has made somewelcome moveson this issue, including reducing the gap in inspections from six years to four years and requiring new settings to be inspected within 12 months of opening, it is yet to set out a timeframe for when these powers will come into effect. Furthermore, currently, if a setting deregisters and closes, Ofsted has no powers to investigate that setting and the staff who worked there any further.Every time one of these horrifying cases comes to light, we all say, “never again”. Every time a government minister speaks about these cases, they say children’s safety is of the utmost importance to government. The time for prevarication is over. Parents are demanding immediate action, and we need to work cross-party to secure change.Munira Wilson is Liberal Democrat MP for TwickenhamDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is not undermining the democratic processGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastWed 10 Dec 2025 22.40 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 22.47 ESTShareAconstitutional challenge is pending against the government’sunder-16 social media account ban. The case argues that the law contravenes the implied freedom of political communication. It is likely to fail.Two 15-year-olds, Noah Jones and Macy Neyland, backed by the Digital Freedom Project advocacy groupwill argue that the law is unconstitutionalbecause it impermissibly burdens the implied freedom of political communication.A law that has the effect of reducing the overall volume of political communication in Australia will be invalid unless it is proportionate to a legitimate purpose. This rule comes from the Australian constitution’s requirement that parliamentarians be “chosen” by the people and the need for freedom to communicate about political matters for that choice to be meaningful.Julie Inman Grant: Who is the Australian woman taking on the social media behemoths?Read moreThe social media account ban only slightly reduces the overall volume of political communication in Australia: 13, 14 and 15-year-olds were not engaging in much political communication before the ban on having social media accounts.Social mediaplatforms have always said in their terms of service that under-13s cannot have accounts. And the law does not ban teenagers from using the internet or having online group chats, like some overreactions seem to suggest.The case will be heard by the high court in 2026.The government will argue that the social media account ban is a practical and proportionate means of pursuing the legitimate purpose of protecting kids’ health and wellbeing; just like laws restricting teenagers’ access to some movies and video games that sometimes have a bit of political content.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsAs a health protection measure and in other ways, Australia’s ban on social media accounts for under-16s has a lot in common with Australia’s laws on plain packaging for tobacco products. Both laws are world leading. Many other countries have copied Australia’s tobacco plain packaging laws. And it looks like the same will happen with the social media account ban. Malaysia’s equivalent law comes into effect next year and the EU is talking about a similar law.Both also involve large corporations downplaying the potential harm their products cause. The Wall Street Journalrevealed in 2021that Facebook’s “own in-depth research shows a significant teen mental-health issue that Facebook plays down in public”. Social media giants like Meta and TikTok are currently facing lawsuits in the US alleging that their social media platforms are addictive and harmful to children.View image in fullscreenThe prime minister speaks with students and staff at St John Paul II College in Canberra.Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPOne example from the US state of Georgia is theDeKalb County School District’s lawsuitagainst several social media companies claiming that the platforms have “deliberately design[ed] addictive features to capture and exploit children’s attention”. In another ongoing lawsuit, theMassachusetts state government says that its lawsuitabout Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram is “based only on the tools that Meta has developed because its own research shows they encourage addiction to the platform in a variety of ways”.And just last weekHawaii filed a lawsuit against TikTok owner Bytedanceaccusing it of having “knowingly designed an addictive platform that harms users, particularly children, while misleading the public about the risks”.Another similarity with plain packaging laws is that existing regulations and practices were insufficient. Before plain packaging there were rules about mandatory warning labels and some restrictions on advertising. Some cigarettes had nicotine filters. But these measures were insufficient.Likewise, the existing rules around social media accounts for teens appear insufficient. Those rules include social media platforms’ terms of service not allowing under-13s to have accounts, which came about as a result of an American law. Another insufficient approach is the special teen features like Instagram’s “teen accounts”, which filter out some harmful content.When Australia first proposed plain packaging laws, tobacco companies said there was no evidence that it would be an effective policy. And thesocial media companies have said the same thingabout the social media account ban. For example, in its submission to a parliamentary inquiry into the social media account ban legislation, X said there was no evidence the policy would work.‘Already had a profound effect’: parents react to Australia’s social media banRead moreTobacco giants were even so bold as toappeal tohuman rights and free speech claims toargue againstother countries’ versions of plain packaging laws. Social media giants routinely criticise regulation of their platforms on free speech and human rights grounds.This week Reddit was also reportedly preparing to launchlegal action against the ban. On Tuesday it said it would comply with the ban but said it was“legally erroneous”. The company argued to the eSafety commissioner that its platform was a source of information, not primarily social media. In other words, Reddit seems to be saying that it falls outside the scope of the law.So where to for the constitutional challenge? Here there is another similarity with plain packaging, which also prompted a constitutional challenge. That challenge argued the laws contravened the constitutional rule against acquisition of property without just terms. It was rejected by the high court because nobody had acquired any of the tobacco companies’ property.It’s likely that in the social media account case, once again, the government will succeed because the law complies with the constitution. The under-16s ban is a pragmatic first step in trying to reduce the potential harm on young people caused by addictive products, in this case social media. It is not a law undermining the democratic process.Luke Beck is professor of constitutional law at Monash UniversityExplore more on these topicsSocial media banOpinionAustralian lawAustralian politicsSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

Gael García Bernal plays a sociopathic outsider threatening the apparently perfect life of his long-lost preacher father (William Hurt). In what now looks like a dry run forThere Will Be Blood, Dano is the earnest son campaigning for creationism to be taught at school, and sideswiped by the emergence of his sinister half-brother. Variety labelled the film “noxious”. It’s undoubtedly nasty, but Dano helps to lend it a pulse.9.Swiss Army Man(2016)Superficially macabre, this buddy-movie with Dano as the stranded shipwreck survivor and Daniel Radcliffe as the corpse who washes ashore is surprisingly touching. Sure, it is full of the sort of manufactured eccentricity that would reach fever pitch in the same directors’ next film,Everything Everywhere All at Once. But even as Dano is using Radcliffe’s body as a water dispenser, a hunting weapon and a fart-powered raft, a palpable tenderness emerges. They make a lovely couple.8.The Fabelmans(2022)View image in fullscreenVersatile … (from left): Paul Dano, Mateo Zoryan Francis-DeFord and Michelle Williams in The Fabelmans.Photograph: Merie Weismiller Wallace/APFor a measure of Dano’s versatility, try this: in the space of a few months, he played the placid engineer Burt Fabelman, workaholic dad to the budding film-maker hero of Steven Spielberg’s autobiographical saga (and loosely based on the director’s own father, Arnold),andmenaced Gotham City as the Riddler in The Batman. Dano nails Burt’s hushed, gulping melancholy as he watches his unfaithful wife (Michelle Williams) and ambitious son (Gabriel LaBelle) slip free of his influence.7.Little Miss Sunshine(2006)A likable road movie about an Albuquerque family driving cross-country in a yellow VW van so that the youngest child (Abigail Breslin) can compete in a beauty pageant. It smacks now of a certain Sundance 00s indie preciousness but the cast, including Alan Arkin (who won an Oscar for playing the disreputable grandfather), is a treat. Dano is poignant and funny as the emo teen who communicates solely in scribbled notes (eg “I hate everyone”) until a crisis draws from him an anguished Munchian scream. Few actors could make the mission-statement dialogue that follows – “Fuck beauty contests! Life is one fucking beauty contest after another!” – sound so sincere.6.For Ellen(2012)View image in fullscreenWrenching … Dano in For Ellen.Photograph: Album/AlamyComedian and actor Kate McKinnon described Dano in 2016 as a “hunky sad-eyed sex machine” but that quality has rarely been exploited straightforwardly on screen. One exception is this wrenching study of a deadbeat-dad rock musician who grabs a last chance to connect with his daughter. “It came alive because of Paul,” said the film’s director, So Yong Kim. “He developed so many details. The outfits, the rings, fingernails, hair, the way he walked and carried himself. He transformed completely.”5.The Batman(2022)As the masked, panting, clingfilm-wrapped Riddler, AKA Edward Nashton, Dano is terrifying even when he isn’t dispatching his victims with hammers and bombs. He even seems to give Robert Pattinson’s Batman the heebie-jeebies. Best of all is the moment near the end of Matt Reeves’s increasingly baggy superhero reboot when Dano is at last seen without his mask, and the suspense tightens all at once. Apprehended by cops in a diner, he is presented with an array of different IDs, each one bearing his face. “Which one’s you?” asks the arresting officer. “You tell me,” he replies coolly. Spoken like a true character actor.4.L.I.E.(2001)View image in fullscreenCherubic … Paul Dano in L.I.E.Photograph: Metro Tartan/AllstarDano had amassed plenty of childhood acting experience – aged 12, he was already sharing a Broadway stage with George C Scott – but his special gift for flayed vulnerability was first apparent to cinema audiences in this unsettling indie drama. In only his second screen role, he plays a neglected teenager who falls into the orbit of a sex offender (Brian Cox). Still shocking is the moment when Cox tenderly shaves Dano’s cherubic face with a cut-throat razor. “My first thought now is: how did we do that?”Dano said in 2023, before confirming that Cox, with whom he was reunited in the odd-couple comedy-drama The Good Heart and on television in the BBC’s War and Peace, “was lovely to me”.3.Ruby Sparks(2012)Marketed as a romcom, this is far stickier and more complex than that label would suggest: one wag described it as Annie Hall meets Frankenstein. Back in the care of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the husband-and-wife directing team behind Little Miss Sunshine, Dano plays a blocked novelist whose creative juices start flowing again after he invents an idealised female character, Ruby (played by Dano’s partner, Zoe Kazan, who is also the film’s screenwriter). Once she springs to life, he discovers he can modify and control her characteristics merely by setting them down on paper, which leads to an acutely disturbing climax. Dano is adept at compartmentalising the sweet (Swiss Army Man) and the unsavoury (Prisoners), but it’s fascinating to see them mixed together here on the same palette.2.There Will Be Blood(2007)View image in fullscreenElectrifying … Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano in There Will Be Blood.Photograph: TCD/ProdDB/Alamy‘As a kid, I’d cry every day seeing homeless people’: Paul Dano on money, fatherhood and being shaved by Brian CoxRead moreWhen Paul Thomas Anderson sacked Kel O’Neill, the actor initially cast as the snivelling, sanctimonious preacher Eli Sunday, Dano was promoted to the role with only a few days’ notice. (He also kept his original part, the smaller role of Eli’s brother Paul.) The result is electrifying: Eli may writhe and wriggle as he casts the demons out of his congregation, but it’s Dano who feels like a man possessed. In accusing him of giving “a non-entity performance”,Quentin Tarantinomisunderstands the dynamic between the ogre-like oil prospector Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and the irksome Eli, who threatens his stranglehold. The Pulp Fiction director craves an equally weighted standoff. But the oil titan is rattled and exasperated precisely because this apparently puny adversary gets under his skin. He can’t fathom the boy: he’s not a business rival, like the prim suits Plainview taunts in the restaurant scene, and he isn’t a cheat, like the man posing as Plainview’s brother. Those dopes are run-of-the-mill. (Plainview insults the former and wastes no time killing the latter.) Eli, though, is a uniquely stubborn irritant. To put another alpha-male type opposite Day-Lewis would have rendered the battle conventional. That’s one thing Dano couldn’t be if he tried.1.Love & Mercy(2014)View image in fullscreenA mighty performance … Paul Dano in Love & Mercy.Photograph: François Duhamel/Roadside Attractions/AllstarThis fractured Brian Wilson biopic ping-pongs between the 1960s (LSD, Pet Sounds, the first massing of clamorous voices in Wilson’s head) and the 1980s (when the genius Beach Boy was drugged and dominated by an exploitative doctor, played by Paul Giamatti in skin-crawling mode). A bold concept demands bold actors, and this film has them: John Cusack is suitably dazed and wary as the older Wilson, while Dano has the more demanding task in encapsulating the musician’s fizzing highs and plunging lows, as well as all the shades of trauma in between. From Wilson’s perfectionism in the studio, conducting a chorus of barking dogs or abandoning an expensive recording session because of bad vibrations, to his hounded timidity in the presence of his abusive father (Bill Camp), this is a layered and mighty performance – Dano’s best on film, in fact, equalled only by his portrayal of a convict having an affair with a prison employee in Ben Stiller’s 2018 mini-series Escape at Dannemora. Judging from Tarantino’s macho playground taunts (he calls Dano “weak sauce” and “a weak sister”), his beef seems to hinge on a perceived deficit of red meat in the milky-faced actor. A few minutes of Love & Mercy are all it takes to render that charge at best ill-informed, at worst moronic. As Anthony Lane attestedin his rave New Yorker review: “There is nothing wimpish in [Dano’s] fine depiction of Wilson.”Explore more on these topicsFilmRankedPaul DanoThere Will Be BloodQuentin TarantinoThe FabelmansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rufus wanted to do Always on My Mind, and I looked at the list of nine other songs I’d sent him and thought: why don’t I ask some other people? Like, Low are one of my all-time favourite bands and when I first metMimi Parkershe immediately seemed like someone I’ve known all my life. I told her I’d done one of their songs with Debbie Harry and she looked at me and said: “Why didn’t you ask me?” I thought: touché, Mimi. I suggested [Cass McCombs’s] County Line but she wasn’t well. I told Mimi I’d wait as long as it takes. Then she died. Alan [Sparhawk, Parker’s husband] sang it instead and it’s absolutely amazing.The Pretenders covered Morrissey’sEvery Day Is Like Sundayand now Duets Special featuresThe First of the Gang to Die. As one of Morrissey’s oldest friends, how often doyour conversations reach a philosophical, political or moral impasse?McScootikinsMy relationship with him started because we were both vegetarian and he sent me a postcard asking to meet for tea. Thirty-five years ago most of my mates – Linda McCartney and so on – were friends because of vegetarianism.Morrisseydoes stuff for Peta and he’s an amazing songwriter. A few nights ago I had dinner with a couple of girls he’d worked with. I sent him a picture of the three of us and he immediately sent back a picture of three women from Coronation Street. He’s always true to himself and no, we’ve never reached an impasse.With the Pretenders’ debut turning 45this year, how much was in the works before you metPete [Farndon, bass],Jimmy [Honeyman-Scott, guitar] andMartin [Chambers, drums]?kylewatson04I was staying in a freezing cold attic in a women’s boarding house in Tufnell Park, north London, and had probably written a few of the songs before I met them. Every guitar player I’ve had since James Honeyman-Scott has been influenced by him, for example Johnny Marr. The moment James came to my front door I knew we’d be in a band together. I got friendly with Benji Lysaght – who produced and plays on Duets Special – after he came up to me in catering and said: “Can I ask you something about James Honeyman-Scott?” It’s insane: Jimmy died aged 25, only guitar players remember him and yet he was the sound of the Pretenders. I was an angry biker chick but he brought out the melody.The Pretenders’2000 Milesis back on the airwaves for Christmas. Do you have a favourite festive song?VerulamiumParkRangerNo, I’m like most people, I get pretty fucked off as soon as they start playing Christmas music in the shops. But, talking about Jimmy … a year after he died, I was in the Sunset Marquis [in LA] thinking about him. I rented a guitar and wrote 2000 Miles. I’ve always regretted that the rental company wouldn’t sell it to me because I wanted that guitar so much.View image in fullscreen‘You mom’s on Friends!’ … with  Jennifer Aniston on Friends, season 2, which aired on 2 November 1995.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyWhat was it like to be in an episode of Friends? Were you a big fan?John_Smoove_123I’d never heard of it but Warners were putting out an album to accompany this new show and asked me for a song,Angel of the Morning. Then Friends asked me if I could sit in the background in a coffee shop playing it. I got to go to LA for a week and see my friend but I didn’t know they’d written a whole part for me. Then Friends was on the cover of every American magazine. I thought: “Oh fuck, this is gonna be big.” The cast and everybody were really nice but I always regretted it because until then I could take my kids to school and nobody knew who I was. Afterwards, all the kids were saying: “Your mom’s on Friends!”You’ve made it very clear that you find it awkward being approached for autographs or selfies. If someone recognises you on the street, how should they acknowledge you?SJames42When punk came along my manager wanted to put my face on a billboard in Shepherd’s Bush and I sat on my bed and cried. I could already feel my freedom slipping away. Some people have the personality for that: Paul McCartney is great at being a Beatle. I don’t! I’ve never got used to it. It always freaks me out and I’m not very gracious. Then, afterwards I feel really bad because I don’t want to bum people out. If they just nod or give me a thumbs up, that’s great.You were atKent State University when the Ohio National Guardopened fireon students protesting against the US invasion of Cambodia(killing four)in 1970. What memories can you share about that period?mdperryI was hanging out, smoking pot and listening to Tim Hardin, Tim Buckley, Neil Young, Jeff Beck, Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix. When the National Guard opened fire I was standing right there and had to be carried off the campus because I wouldn’t leave. I knew one of the guys who was killed. We were little acid heads … some of the Devo guys were there too and [Eagles’] Joe Walsh. His band, the James Gang, played in a club where I used to sit at his feet and touch his tennis shoes.

When I was a kid, I loved horses and would draw them all the time. I knew there was an English style of riding and an English saddle. Then, when I was 14, I heard the Beatles and there was no turning back.When you visit the US,what’s the main thing you miss aboutit?nivlek47I don’t miss it. When they tore out the train system and got rid of any form of public transport, I had this inherent suspicion that it wasn’t gonna work for me, so I left aged 22. I still get the tube in London.I saw you arrested live on stage at the Nashville, West Kensington around 1981. Why did that happen?TonyBrownI don’t think I was arrested. I think the police stopped the show for a noise issue or something. The one thing I remember about that Nashville Rooms show was that I had drunk a lot of tequila beforehand and I never drank before a show again because it impaired my abilities. That night, I piercedJohnny Rotten’s ear in the toilet, by pushing an earring through it into a bar of soap.If in 1976 Johnny Rotten or Sid Vicious had accepted your proposal to get married, what would life together have been like?Dmitry_SThat was just so I could stay in the country, but life with either of them would have been chaos. I knew Sid before the Pistols. One night, we were walking along the street and he said: “John’s asked me to join the band.” I said: “But it’s like you’re already in them.” And he went: “Yeah, I know.” I watched him learning to play bass on speed for three days, listening to Ramones records. He was lovely. Then along came drugs, alcohol and violence and he changed rapidly once he metNancy [Spungen]. He had a great voice. I think he was more talented than he ever got to show.View image in fullscreen‘Punk girls’ … Chrissie Hynde, Jordan and Vivienne Westwood at Westwood’s shop ‘Sex’, King’s Road, London, 1976.Photograph: David Dagley/ShutterstockDo you keep in contact with the less famous women who you got to know during the early days of punk?

The work will also reduce the Barbican’s carbon use by 40%, according to Simpson.It is only the second time in its history that it will have closed for a sustained period, the other being during the Covid-19 pandemic.That means the London Symphony Orchestra, which has called the Barbican home since it opened, must perform elsewhere, as will theRoyal Shakespeare Company.Dame Kathryn McDowell, the orchestra’s managing director, said the LSO was committed to providing a 2028-29 season “acrossLondonand the UK” and confirmed that the LSO St Luke’s venue would remain open throughout the closure of the Barbican.LSO/Pappano review – big, bold and filled with blazing convictionRead moreThe Barbican also plans to continue having a presence in the capital, with events outside of its City of London base. “When we talk about closure, there’s a physical side of it, but actually, existentially we’re still present,” Simpson said.It is not clear what will happen for the 400 Barbican staff, who were informed of the closure on Thursday evening.The organisation did not rule out redundancies, saying all options were being considered. Secondments at the Barbican’s founder and main funder, the City of London Corporation, were another potential option.Simpson said: “Obviously, we’re already talking to unions and will work really, really closely with them. It will be done in consultation as transparently and as carefully as we possibly can and make sure that it’s actually worked through rather than rushing.”The GMB senior organiser Lisa Bangs said the union welcomed the “much-needed refurbishment” but would be pushing for casual and permanent staff to keep their jobs.She said: “We want to ensure that staff are retained and protected during these works and we will always advocate strongly for our members. The Barbican have been in touch and we look forward to working constructively with them as plans develop.”The Barbican has just announced anew chief executive, Abigail Pogson, who will oversee the capital project, the first major renewal work in its history. She is the latest arrival at an organisation that has had several changes in leadership over the past five years.In 2021, Sir Nicholas Kenyon resigned as managing director after staff told the Guardian that the Barbican was “institutionally racist”. He was followed by the former BBC arts correspondent Will Gompertz, who left to join the Sir John Soane’s Museum afterbeing in the job for only two years.Devyani Saltzman started as director of arts and participation in 2024, and is one ofseven senior leadersinstalled after the Barbican replaced the managing director model. They all report to Pogson, who will start in January 2026.The Barbican first revealed plans for the renovation work in May this year. The grade II-listed cultural destination had “deteriorated significantly” over the years and needed significant work done to improve it, according to the plan.The first phase of the project will cost £231m and be led by Simpson, who did a similar job forthe Young V&A in east London, which won museum of the year in 2024. The overall bill is estimated to be £451m.Opened in 1982, the Barbican arts centre is a unique cultural institution. The centre’s cultural offering was originally primarily designed forthe 4,000 residents of the flatsset around the site.Today, more than 1.5 million people visit annually, making it one of themost popular cultural attractionsin the UK.Explore more on these topicsBarbicanLondon Symphony OrchestraRoyal Shakespeare CompanyTheatreLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Dozens of people queued for hours for the privilege.Photograph: Sipa/ShutterstockView image in fullscreenLe Monde front page on Tuesday.Photograph: Le MondeIt was at the Arles photography festival that Parr first came to be appreciated as a serious artist, when his Last Resort series of images of the working-class seaside resort of New Brighton, Merseyside, was featured at the summer event in Provence in 1986; he was invited to curate the festival as guest artistic director in 2004.“I think Parr felt for a long time he was neglected in England,”said Bajac, the director of the Jeu de Paume arts centre in Paris. “But here it was a real love affair since the 1990s.Nul n’est prophète en son pays,we say in France. ‘No one is a prophet in their own land.’”The British photographer is best known for pictures that document characteristically English pastimes – holidays in seaside resorts, tea parties, vegetable-growing competitions – but the humorous tone of his work gave him a global appeal.View image in fullscreenMartin Parr speaking at Paris Photo, Grand Palais, France, in 2019.Photograph: Alfonso Jimenez/Shutterstock“Parr was an Englishman through and through,” said Andreas Wellnitz, a German picture editor and visual consultant for the colour supplement of the weekly Die Zeit. “But you could identify with his pictures anywhere in the world.”“Normal people could find themselves within his photographs because he found beauty in the everyday,” said Wellnitz, who worked on several projects with Parr from 2011 onwards. “His pictures managed to be neither boring nor cynical.”Germany was one country where, Parr’s influence played out less via galleries than through print. At the award-winning supplement of Die Zeit, Parr’s use of harsh flash and saturated colours proved as influential as those of the lifestyle photographers turned artists Wolfgang Tillmans and Jürgen Teller.View image in fullscreenA visitor takes in The Last Resort series during an exhibition of Martin Parr’s work at the NRW-Forum in Düsseldorf, Germany, in 2019.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyIn the US, the British photographer’s eye for the garish and absurd turned out to be a natural match for the gonzo journalism of Vice, the Canadian-American lifestyle magazine.Martin Parr: the photographer’s career in picturesRead more“Parr’s influence on American photography feels boundless,” said Elizabeth Renstrom, a former photo editor at Vice, pointing to the scrappy, flash-heavy aesthetic that came to define the magazine’s early photographic journalism.“His saturated colours, brazen closeness, and willingness to let the absurd sit shoulder to shoulder with the sincere offered young American photographers a visual vocabulary that didn’t apologise for being blunt.“In the Vice universe, this translated into assignments that felt both confrontational and conspiratorial, the kind of imagery that winks at you while documenting something undeniably real,” Renstrom added.In 2018, the magazine covered the midterm elections not just directly from the campaign trail but from thehome of “the original Donald”, Disney World. “Parr showed that humour wasn’t a detour from truth but a way into it.”View image in fullscreenMartin Parr speaks to people at a photo exhibition at the Blindspot Gallery in Hong Kong in 2014.Photograph: Kees Metselaar/AlamyIn Britain, reservations about his work have centred around the question of how much that humour relies on cliches and stereotypes: working-class Britons with sunburnt backs, middle-class Britons with socks and sandals, fascinators and top hats at Ascot.‘I drunkenly hugged him and said I love you, Martin Parr!’ Grayson Perry, Don McCullin and more on Britain’s national photographerRead moreParr himself was critical of the use of cliche in photography – his own and that of others. “I have come to the conclusion that we too are fairly predictable in what we photograph,” he said in a2010 speechthat condemned tropes such as The New Rich, The Bent Lamp-post and The Modern Typology. “We need to consider our subject matter more carefully,” he added.Curators who worked with Parr outside Britain, however, say his anthropological gaze always went deeper. “He was great at engaging with people,” said Wellnitz. “He wasn’t just interested in capturing cliches but learning about people.”If photographic projects in the first half of his career were mostly focused on English places and social groups, Parr applied his later lens to locations across the globe, including Hong Kong, the Acropolis in Athens, the Amalfi coast and Machu Picchu. His interest in Asian photographic traditions brought forth two books he compiled and edited, 2004’s The Photobook: A History, Volume 1, which highlighted Japan’s central role in the genre, and 2015’s The Chinese Photobook.Martin Parr catches the cherry blossom season in Kyoto – in picturesRead moreOne of his first projects abroad, Japonais Endormis, a 1998 photobook of people who had fallen asleep on the Tokyo metro, fostered a lasting bond with Japan. “There is a huge appreciation for observational photography in Japan, and Martin’s added humour and irony translate well here,” said Lucille Reyboz and Yusuke Nakanishi, the directors of the Kyotographie photography festival.For the 2025 festival, the pair invited Parr to document the impact of overtourism on famous Kyoto sites such as the Kinkaku-ji temple or the city’s cherry blossom spots. Japan’s national public broadcaster NHK followed Parr around for several days. “Martin offered affection and critique without cliche, and his profoundly human gaze on Kyoto will resonate here forever,”Reyboz and Nakanishi said.If Parr in Britain is remembered as a satirical chronicler of English traditions, his status in countries such as France and Japan has come to be that of a political artist monitoring modernity. Global Warning, a Parr retrospective opening at Jeu de Paume in late January next year, will focus on recurring themes of consumer excess, the prevalence of car culture and our dependence on technology.View image in fullscreenMartin Parr takes photographs in Japan, where he developed a last bond after a photobook project in 1998.Photograph: Artist/Hiroshi Yamauchi“While his work often focused on ‘Englishness’, Japanese audiences often responded more to the humour and satire in his work, and its universal commentaries on human behaviour, consumerism and globalisation,” said Reyboz and Nakanishi.Explore more on these topicsMartin ParrPhotographyFranceJapanExhibitionsClass issuesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This year’s top ten contains no operas. There has been a profound change in record companies’ policies of how and what they record. The glitzy, studio-based opera recordings of the last century now seem impossible to contemplate, and even releasing audio-only recordings taken directly from live opera-house performances often seems less viable than issuing DVDs of the same productions.Some specialist labels devoted to specific areas of the operatic repertoire continue sterling work: operas feature prominently inBru Zane’s mission on behalf of neglected French composers, whileOpera Raracontinues to crusade for forgotten, mostly 19th century, mostly Italian, scores which this year included the original 1857 version of Verdi’s Simon Boccanegra. Other companies continue to find treasures in Europe’s apparently inexhaustible baroque archives, while, on its own label, the London Symphony Orchestra has continued to releaseSimon Rattle’s Janáček series taken from his concert performanceswith the orchestra at the Barbican, the latest release beingJenůfa. If full-length operas are notably scarce in the schedules of the major companies, two exceptions this year wereDecca’s releaseof the Oslo-sourcedFlying Dutchman, with Lise Davidsen and Gerald Finley, and Deutsche Grammophon’sLady Macbeth of Mtsensk, part of Andris Nelson’s Boston-based Shostakovich series, both of which proved less than overwhelming.Other areas of the recorded repertory have continued to expand in their own, often cheerfully haphazard, ways. While the central symphonic repertoire generally remains oversubscribed, so that, say, a new cycle of Beethoven symphonies has to have a selling point other than its intrinsic musical worth, some composers do seem immune to overcrowding: at least two high-profile Mahler cycles are under way, and though the latest instalment of Semyon Bychkov’s series with the Czech Philharmonic,the Third Symphony, was disappointingly pallid,Simon Rattle’s account of the Seventh, with the Bavarian Radio Symphony was anything but, and belongs among the finest versions of this perplexing work available on disc.The series of recordings of mostly British music from John Wilson and his Sinfonia of London often revisit well-explored territory, too, but the quality of the orchestral playing is invariably so high it justifies the release itself. The superlative standard of the performances on their own label from the Berlin Philharmonic under Kirill Petrenko similarly needs no excuse, but this year’s Schoenberg collection is exceptional even by the usual Berlin standards, for it includes an outstanding account of a real rarity,the oratorio Die Jakobsleiter, a torso which, as Petrenko shows, contains some of the greatest music of Schoenberg’s freely atonal period during the first world war.As in almost every year, there are more superlative discs of piano music than can reasonably be included in a roundup such as this. There was no room, for instance, forAlice Sara Ott’s affectionate survey of John Field’s Nocturnes,Bertrand Chamayou’s glittering Ravel tribute orTamara Stefanovich’s coruscating accounts of 20th-century piano sonatas by Shostakovich, Eisler, Bartók and Boulez. And the release on disc of the performance of Rachmaninov’s Third Piano Concerto with whichYunchan Limwon the 2022 Van Cliburn competition to launch himself internationally is a document for posterity, whilePierre-Laurent Aimard’s performances of a generous selection of the miniatures in György Kurtág’s Jatékok, recorded in the composer’s presence, have an unrepeatable authority.Though there were plenty of concerts paying tribute to Pierre Boulez on his centenary, there were surprisingly few new discs marking the event, thoughQuatuor Diotima’s first ever recording of the final version of Livre pour Quatuor, and especially thecoupling on Bastille Musiqueof the rarely recorded Éclat/Multiples and Sur Incises, were important additions to the Boulez discography. Luciano Berio’s centenary was shamefully neglected, both in the concert hall and on disc, but the Diotima’s recording did offer another birthday tribute that was equally significant, equally definitive, as they marked Helmut Lachenmann’s 90th birthday with impressively authoritative accounts of his three string quartets.Andrew ClementsOur top 10 albums of 20251.Schoenberg: Violin Concerto, Verklärte Nacht, Die Jakobsleiter/Berlin Philharmonic/Petrenko(Berliner Philharmoniker)View image in fullscreenThe Berlin Philharmonic perform at the Philharmonie Berlin.Photograph: Stephan Rabold/BPHR/Stephan Rabold“An impressive collection … in a superb account of the Violin Concerto, the soloist, Patricia Kopatchinskaja, turns what can sometimes seem a rather four-square, dutifully conventional piece into something constantly surprising.”Read the full review.2.Mahler: Symphony No 7/Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra/Rattle(BR Klassik)View image in fullscreenShiveringly vivid … Simon Rattle conducting the Bavarian RSO.Photograph: Astrid Ackermann“It’s the sheer brilliance of the BRSO’s playing that grabs the attention, every detail and instrumental effect shiveringly vivid, and all perfectly captured in sound that is so much better than either of Rattle’s earlier versions.”Read the full review.3.Kurtág: Játékok/Pierre-Laurent Aimard(Pentatone)View image in fullscreenPierre-Laurent Aimard (left) and György Kurtág, during the recording sessions.Photograph: Balint Hrotko“Whole worlds of expression are encapsulated in just a few bars, and listening to Aimard’s exemplary performances provides as important an insight into Kurtág’s very personal musical thinking as any of his larger-scale, more ‘public’ pieces.

Losing one half of the show’s central duo was no easy thing to move past, but The Last of Us morphed into a touching meditation on grief, loss and the pain of love left unspoken – with added mushroom monsters.What we said:“A gutsy and thoughtful rendering of humans on the edge.”Read more49All Her FaultView image in fullscreenNo one is more watchable … Sarah Snook and Dakota Fanning in All Her Fault.Photograph: Peacock/AP(Sky Atlantic/Now) Is anyone as watchable as Sarah Snook? Her performance as Marissa, whose son Milo was kidnapped when she thought he was on a play date, was an absolute powerhouse as we’ve come to expect from the Succession star. It started with the most profound fear a parent can face, before it turned out to be even worse: orchestrated from within her own inner circle. But the plight of Dakota Fanning as her friend Jenny, trying to navigate the incessant hell and guilt of being a working mother, was relatable and affecting too. Together, they deepened this thriller into something far more intriguing.What we said:“All Her Fault is fantastically well done. All the carefully planted seeds come to fruition. All the narrative cogs turn and interlock fast and seamlessly. You come for the terrifying premise and stay for the absolute pleasure.”Read more48The Last Musician of Auschwitz(BBC Two/iPlayer) This exceptional film told the extraordinary story of the now 100-year-old cellist Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, the only surviving member of the women’s orchestra at Auschwitz. First-hand testimonies – including from the stoic, straight-talking subject herself – plus archive footage and musical performances merged to show the emotional turmoil of prisoners playing beautiful music in a hellscape, as well as tiny glimmers of resistance.What we said:“This incredibly impressive programme does not let us forget about Auschwitz’s corpse mountains or stench of burning bodies for a second, all the while posing questions about art and humanity that should ring in your ears for years to come.”Read more47Apple Cider VinegarView image in fullscreenA tissue of lies … Kaitlyn Dever as Belle Gibson in Apple Cider Vinegar.Photograph: Ben King/AP(Netflix) A remarkable true story, superbly told; this series dramatised the rise and fall of Belle Gibson, an Australian woman who established herself as a “wellness guru” by falsely claiming to have mitigated cancer via dietary tricks and alternative medicine. The truth was simpler: Gibson didn’t have cancer and her career and persona was a tissue of lies. Kaitlyn Dever’s portrayal of Gibson was admirably nuanced; she’s deeply dishonest but also desperately needy and in denial about the consequences of her actions, not least for her followers, some of whom relied upon her hokum to combat life-threatening conditions.What we said:“A fast, drily witty, acutely intelligent, compassionate and furious commentary on greed, need, mass delusion, self-deception, the exploitation of the credulous and the enabling of insidious new forms of all of these by technology.”Read more46The ResidenceView image in fullscreenCharmingly good fun … The Residence.Photograph: Erin Simkin/Netflix(Netflix) Something terrible has happened at the White House! No, not Donald Trump’s new ballroom extension but a fictional murder at the heart of American power. This funny, quirky whodunnit starred Uzo Aduba as Cordelia Cupp, an eccentric detective (she’s a keen birder, dresses entirely in brown tweed and frequently utilises her binoculars for work purposes) sent to solve the case. It’s charmingly good fun – essentially a country house murder mystery with added snark and West Wing trappings.What we said: “A gorgeous, gleeful romp.”Read more45Common Side EffectsView image in fullscreenAn absolute triumph … Common Side Effects.Illustration: Adult Swim(Adult Swim/Channel 4) Has Mike Judge ever made a bad show? This is the question it was hard not to ponder while watching this impeccable animated thriller-comedy. The plot? A fungi expert discovers a mysterious mushroom that seems to cure all illness, and ill-advisedly tells his childhood crush Frances – who now works for big pharma. The resulting high-octane deep-state drama was a blackly humorous adventure with real heart that satirised the state of healthcare in a capitalist society. An absolute triumph of TV-making.What we said:“Not merely the best thing I’ve seen on TV this year but one of the best shows I’ve seen in my life.”Read more44Gaza: Doctors Under Attack(Channel 4) The film the BBC couldn’t broadcast. Thanks be, then, to Channel 4 for stepping into the breach and airing it – for this was an essential document of our times. Its unsparing look at the targeting of Palestinian medics showed a pattern that has emerged over the past two years at hospitals across Gaza. First, they are bombed. Then, they are raided and doctors detained and tortured. Then, when their workplaces are reduced to rubble, the cycle starts on the next hospital. The testimony by Dr Khaled Hamouda, whose home was bombed, killing most of his family … before a drone strike mere moments later hit the supposed safe house his remaining children had escaped to, was an unforgettable piece of television that really needed to be aired.What we said:“In an open letter before its broadcast, Channel 4’s Louisa Compton warned that Doctors Under Attack would ‘make people angry, whichever side they take’. She is right. This is the sort of television that will never leave you.”Read more43Am I Being Unreasonable?View image in fullscreenDangerously addictive … Daisy May Cooper as Nic in Am I Being Unreasonable?Photograph: Simon Ridgway/BBC/Boffola Pictures(BBC One/iPlayer) This riot of marital, sexual and social awkwardness (with a side order of murder and betrayal) came courtesy of Daisy May Cooper and Selin Hizli, who have created a worthy successor to Julia Davis’s scabrous 2004 sitcom Nighty Night. Cooper stars as Nic, a woman juggling guilt, trauma and parenting catastrophe, still finding time for extramarital hi-jinks and yetsomehowremaining deserving of sympathy, mainly because of the cavalcade of monsters around her. A dangerously addictive chamber of horrors.What we said:“Howlingly funny.”Read more42Task(Sky Atlantic/Now) This crime drama starring Mark Ruffalo as gone-to-seed cop Tom Brandis allocated a dangerous new assignment in Philadelphia certainly wasn’t for the faint-hearted. But if you could handle the all-pervasive air of impending catastrophe, it was a fine, gritty, twisty procedural centred on stick-up merchants, biker gangs and the grim ramifications of the fentanyl trade. An intense downer, in the best possible way.What we said:“A meditation on guilt, sin and the possibility of redemption.”Read more41The TraitorsView image in fullscreenThe worst traitor ever to roam the castle … Linda, with fellow traitor Minah and faithful Fozia.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert(BBC One/iPlayer) Before the celebrity version gave us Alan Carr, the third series of normies Traitors delivered Linda, AKA the worst/best traitor to ever roam the castle. Her head-turn when Claudia Winkleman said “traitors” wasn’t the only golden moment. Charlotte’s fake Welsh accent! Lisa the vicar’s bare-faced lie about her job! The shock return of Alexander! Rare is the show that makes appointment TV and creates national watercooler chat in 2025. But beyond all that – Claudia’s gothic outfits alone were worth tuning in for.What we said:“As a study of human behaviour – of deception, manipulation, self-preservation – it remains captivating. As perhaps the best example of social experiment-style reality TV, it has cemented its place in the cultural firmament.”Read more40-3140Dope ThiefView image in fullscreenRide-or-dies … Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura in Dope Thief.Photograph: Jessica Kourkounis/AP(Apple TV) The two amiable, small-time Philadelphia crooks at the heart of Dope Thief have a good thing going. They rob low-level stash houses disguised as DEA officers and put on a performance of authority to avoid using violence. But when a big score at an out-of-town location is offered, they roll the dice and very quickly regret it: soon they have a bunch of very dangerous people on their tails. The key to this show was the chemistry between ride-or-die leads Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura. As the stakes rose, these alternately hilarious and heartbreaking hoods had us rooting for them in no time.What we said:“Brian Tyree Henry ranges from comedy to tragedy in a single scene and never misses a beat. He is extraordinary and the rest of the cast are up there with him. He gives Dope Thief heart and at times threatens to break the viewer’s. Wonderful.”Read more39Squid GameView image in fullscreen‘Hi, Cate Blanchett!’ … Squid Game.Photograph: Netflix(Netflix) Hwang Dong-hyuk’s killer game dystopia was one of those exciting shows that nobody saw coming – and it quickly became the biggest show of 2021. But after the sagging second series, the end was in sight with this final one. Fans simplyneededto know whether Player 456 – name: Gi-hun – could take down the evil game masters and VIPs from within. While he attempted that, new games meant more scream-at-the-screen entertainment, and we had other contestants to side with (or hate). The twists were totally bewildering (hi, Cate Blanchett!), which made this one hell of a ride to the finish line.What we said:“If you can get on board with the new contestant twist – and that is a big if – then the final two episodes have a nicely grand and operatic feel to them, and ultimately, Squid Game does its job.”Read more38Dept. Q(Netflix) Like a Scottish Slow Horses, but with fewer fart gags. This TV adaptation of a series of Danish crime novels – relocated to Edinburgh – was a sarcasm-packed thrill ride as it told the tale of unpopular maverick copper Carl Morck, sent to work on futile cold cases in the basement. You couldn’t help but root for the team he pulls together to track down a missing lawyer, but the show’s real joy lay in the dynamic between grumpy Morck andKelly Macdonaldas his cheeky, pomp-pricking, work-mandated therapist.What we said:“It is all fantastically well, and rigorously, done. The pacing has a leisurely confidence that some may find a touch slow, but allows for a character-first approach, creating a richness that amply rewards initial patience.”Read more37This City Is Ours(BBC One/iPlayer) The city in question was Liverpool and while the drug gang at this drama’s heart had the territory well and truly locked down, the internal politics of family and succession were a different matter. James Nelson-Joyce stole the show as Michael, the gang’s heir apparent who finds his assumed rise to the top threatened by retiring boss Ronnie’s (Sean Bean) surprising preference for his feckless son Jamie. Needless to say, as the brains and the brawn of the operation, Michael doesn’t take this well. This City Is Ours never fully escaped from standard gangster tropes but instead, leaned into them with compelling relish. And that final rooftop standoff! Breathtakingly tense.What we said:“The Sopranos influence can be felt” …Read more36The Beast in MeView image in fullscreenAwards will surely be given … Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys in The Beast in Me.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/AP(Netflix) An extraordinary performance of jittery, self-destructive anguish fromClaire Daneslies at the heart of this ambiguous psychological thriller. Danes is Aggie Wiggs, a creatively blocked and prickly author who is dealing with the trauma of bereavement. When Matthew Rhys’s rebarbative (indeed, possibly murderous) real estate magnate Nile Jarvis moves in next door, it seems like the last thing she needs. Sure enough, the pair hate each other almost on sight – but soon, a weird, co-dependent fascination develops between them which leads to some very dark waters indeed. The two leads inspire each other into something genuinely startling.What we said:“It is, they are, absolutely wonderful to watch. Awards will surely be given, and in the meantime you cannot look away.”Read more35A Thousand Blows(Disney+) The best of Steven Knight’s many shows this year, this punchy underworld drama contained pretty much a full house of his favourite tropes: strangely poetic outlaws, beautifully realised period trappings (London’s East End in the grubby, gruesome late Victorian era) and regular outbursts of bone-crunching violence. It also boasted a trio of magnificent lead performances: Malachi Kirby’s immigrant boxer, Hezekiah Moscow, was charming, principled and deadly, while charismatic gang leader Mary Carr (Erin Doherty) was shrewd and slippery. Meanwhile, Stephen Graham – an actor whose combination of vulnerability and volatility loomed over this TV year – was somehow terrifying and desperately poignant as fading prize-fighter Henry “Sugar” Goodson.What we said:“Hasan irresistible, Dickensian-yarn quality that helps smuggle in timely social and political commentary, much as the great man did himself.”Read more34I Love LAView image in fullscreenA gen Z delight … I Love LA.Photograph: HBO/Sky Comedy(Sky Comedy/Now) Is internet comedianRachel Sennottthe Lena Dunham of her generation? Her first comedy series certainly has potential to be as relevant to gen Z as Girls was for millennials. The show follows 27-year-old aspiring talent manager Maia (Sennott) in LA as she navigates relationships, friendships, career ambitions and all of life’s mortifying moments in between. It took a few episodes to find its feet but the cast burst with energy as they delivered near-constant gags. Plus, for the millennials: Leighton Meester guest stars as Maia’s boss.What we said:“The endless embarrassments and boundless opportunities of celebrity can seem, by season’s end, not too different from that of being alive, particularly in one’s 20s. It’s a bumpy ride, but they’re just getting started.”Read more33The ChangeView image in fullscreenGorgeous whimsy … Bridget Christie as Linda in The Change.Photograph: Photographer: Jon Hall/Channel 4(Channel 4) Bridget Christie’s comedy drama is something special: a deeply personal call to arms for menopausal women who feel invisible. It’s also hilarious. Linda (Christie) is a fiftysomething mother and wife who escapes life on a motorbike to go and find herself in the Forest of Dean. By series two, she has had quite an effect on the local people: women wear “Je suis Linda” T-shirts and, armed with their copy of Linda’s Ledger, boycott doing unrecognised work. But she’s still on her own journey, too, with plenty of touching moments and acts of sisterhood. All of this was explored with Christie’s gorgeous whimsy. What a shame Channel 4 cancelled the show, despite Christie writing it for a three-series arc. Hopefully it will find a new home.What we said:“The Change is still the best (and probably the only) TV comedy series ever written about menopause.”Read more32South ParkView image in fullscreenIncredible … Donald Trump and Satan in bed in South Park.Illustration: YouTube(Paramount+) After Paramount settled a lawsuit with Donald Trump for $16m (£13.5m) and discontinued Stephen Colbert’s show after the late-night host called the deal “a big fat bribe”, South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker signed a $1.5bn five-year contract with the network – and immediately fought back. Episode one starred Donald Trump with a micropenis, climbing into bed with Satan. ICE, AI, tech bros and Labubus have all been in the line of fire. For an animated show in its 28th series to not just stay relevant, but boldly retaliate against the Trump administration’s censoring of the media, is incredible. It’s also still really, really funny.What we said:“Even for a show like South Park, which has often been defined by its anger, this may well go down as its most furious ever.”Read more31Mussolini: Son of the Century(Sky Atlantic/Now) Joe Wright’s stylish adaptation of Antonio Scurati’s doorstop of a historical novel followed Il Duce’s wobbly first steps towards fascism, as he moved from national laughing stock to the March on Rome and his ultimate enshrining as dictator. Luca Marinelli was chillingly compelling as a fourth-wall-breaking Mussolini, walking the audience through each of his norm-shattering acts in a series that served as a honking great warning klaxon in these fractious times.What we said:“A brilliantly performed portrait of a pathetic monster.”Read more30-21 coming soonStay tuned for the next episode"

Over the last three decades – beginning with her 1997 Booker winner, The God of Small Things, which catapulted her into celebrity – the writer’s works of fiction, nonfiction and essays have indeed been polarising; she has become one of the most prominent critics of the Indian government and Hindu nationalism.Last year, she was awarded thePEN Pinter prize, given to writers who cast an “unflinching, unswerving” gaze on the world. Earlier this year, she publishedMother Mary Comes To Me, an account of her relationship with her mother. The memoir has now been namedFoyles book of the year, and was also shortlisted for Waterstones book of the year. Here, Priya Bharadia takes readers through Roy’s essential reads.The entry pointRoy’s debut novel and instant bestseller,The God of Small Things, is the perfect introduction to the major political concerns of her work, from environmental damage, to caste, to the lingering trauma of colonial violence on a nation.The novel follows fraternal twins Rahel and Estha who reunite as adults after a tragic event separates them in childhood. Roy highlights the ways politics infiltrates love and intimacy: social prejudices and invisible taboos, which Roy refers to as the “Love Laws”, hold the characters back from fulfilling bonds.Before writing books, Roy trained as an architect in New Delhi, and hasspokenabout the parallels between the design of novels and buildings. Her careful attention to structure underpins the novel, as she teases our emotions to great – if painful – effect. The reasons behind this family’s bitterness remain hidden until the novel’s end. All we feel at first is the sting of the cruelty and, once the cause is revealed, only an ache at its senselessness.The personal oneIn her 2025 memoir Mother Mary Comes To Me, Roy documents her childhood and coming-of-age through her turbulent relationship with her mother, whom she describes as “my shelter and my storm”. Mary Roy, who died in 2022 at 88, was a force in her own right: she founded a renowned school in Kottayam, and won alandmark supreme court caseagainst her own family that affirmed equal inheritance rights for Syrian Christian women. The memoir is a sweeping account of Roy’s writing career, her observations of a changing India and the enduring complexities of the mother-daughter relationship.The one that deserves more attentionOriginally written as an introduction to BR Ambedkar’s fiery 1936 polemicAnnihilation of Caste, The Doctor and the Saint, published as a standalone essay in 2017, tells the story of the two titans of modern Indian history – Mahatma Gandhi andAmbedkar– and their rival visions for the country. The book is also a bold reappraisal of Gandhi, contending with the troubling and admirable aspects of his legacy. In just over 100 pages, Roy offers a searing takedown of the caste system in India: its history, how it operates and its enduring grip on the world’s largest democracy.The one worth persevering withPublished 20 years after her debut,The Ministry of Utmost Happinessmarked Roy’s highly anticipated return to the novel form. Here, Roy is concerned with how we find love and self-expression in times of political suppression. Moving between Delhi and Kashmir, Roy weaves the lives of a vivid cast of characters, each in different circumstances, all struggling towards liberation. It is more sprawling in structure (some patience is needed as we’re tugged between memories and the present) yet more urgent in tone than her first work of fiction.If you’re short on timeFor a quintessential but quick Roy essay, 2011’sWalking With the Comradesis a strong choice. For several weeks, Roy travels through the forests of Central India with a group of Naxalite indigenous rebels, after their battle with the Indian government to prevent the mining and extraction of their land. Between her accounts of the insurgents she met, Roy addresses the connections between environmental destruction, state violence and global capitalism. A fascinating piece of reportage.If you only read one, it should beHalf literary criticism, half polemic, Roy compiles her thoughts on the purpose of fiction in times of growing authoritarianism in her essay collection Azadi: Fascism, Fiction and Freedom in the Time of the Virus. The title comes from “Azad”, the Urdu word for “freedom”, which is now synonymous with the Kashmiri fight for self-determination.Particular standouts include Intimations of an Ending: The Rise and Rise of the Hindu Nation, an overview of the origins and growth of the Hindutva movement. In a Cambridge lecture, The Graveyard Talks Back: Fiction in the Time of Fake News, Roy builds on the image of thekabristan(the Muslim graveyard) to argue it is fiction alone that can accurately depict the lives of people who are suppressed and silenced: “Only fiction can tell about air that is so thick with fear and loss, with pride and mad courage, and with unimaginable cruelty.”Explore more on these topicsBooksWhere to start withArundhati RoyAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When asked if she was involved, Allen said: “I might be. The ink is not dry … But, you know, I’m definitely having some conversations with people about it. It’s very exciting.”West End Girl would certainly lend itself to a dramatisation:the album is a sustained piece of storytelling that depicts a marriage and its unravelling.Allen has said it is “inspired by what went on” in her marriage to US actor David Harbour, known for his roles in Stranger Things and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. “There are things that are on the record that I experienced within my marriage, but that’s not to say that it’s all gospel,” she told Vogue.Lily Allen’s West End Girl is funny, sexy, jawdropping – and forged in the fires of tabloid Britain | Jennifer Jasmine WhiteRead moreThe album opens with the happy scene of someone moving – as Allen did in real life – to New York, where she and Harbour bought a house together (“Now I’m looking at houses with four or five floors / And you’ve found us a brownstone, said ‘you want it? It’s yours’”).But an argument over returning to London to perform in a play – which Allen also did in real life,appearing in 2:22 A Ghost Story– sours the rest of the opening title track, and things get much worse in the ensuing songs: infidelity, sex addiction, substance use and the horrors of dating apps are explored as the marriage becomes a toxic open relationship.West End Girl, Allen’s first album since 2018, reached No 2 in the UK charts and has been one of the pop cultural moments of 2025. Allen is performing the album in full in asold out run in UK theatres in 2026, then touring it in arenas.The album has also found a sizeable audience in the US: Allen is performing on Saturday Night Live this weekend, and embarking on a US tour in April.Explore more on these topicsLily AllenPop and rockTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

But the track was never officially released, after numerous attempts to get the sample cleared were denied.“I got a call from Mick Jagger and he said he’d heard it and he liked the mix,” Fatboy Slim, AKA Norman Cook,told the BBC. “But his management was just like, ‘No, not even negotiable’. We’ve had a pretty flat ‘no’ for 20 years. I think we asked four times, and I wouldn’t have dared to ask them again.”But the Stones eventually relented, allowing Cook to build the track anew from the original parts of Satisfaction: the stems for the track were delivered to him in an armoured van. It will be released with a music video directed by Tom Furse of goth band the Horrors, who used AI to enhance archive photos of the Stones.The Stones’ decision to approve the sample has echoes of how,in 2019, the band relinquished their rights regarding the Verve’s hit Bitter Sweet Symphony.The song used four seconds of an orchestral version of the Stones song The Last Time for its central string motif, which the Stones’ publishing company disputed the use of, and after an out of court settlement the song’s royalties passed to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards as part of a shared songwriting credit.But after what Ashcroft called “a kind and magnanimous gesture from Mick and Keith”, he was granted all future royalties to the song.The Rolling Stones have maintained a relatively low profile following the release of their comeback album Hackney Diamonds in 2023 and a tour in 2024, though guitarist Ronnie Wood said in May that the band were still planning another album.Cook, 62, remains highly active, having just hosted his All Back to Minehead weekend festival featuring sets from artists including actor Simon Pegg, and planning three large outdoor concerts on Brighton beach in July 2026. He has also recently published a book, It Ain’t Over ’Til the Fatboy Sings.Explore more on these topicsFatboy SlimDance musicThe Rolling StonesnewsShareReuse this content"

Both will play the same characters as in the original set of films – Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen and Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark – with the Hollywood Reporter suggesting they will “likely appear in a flash-forward”. At the close of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 (released in 2015), Everdeen and Mellark are married with children.Sunrise on the Reaping is adapted from the 2025 novel by Suzanne Collins, and will be the second prequel film in the series after The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, released in 2023, which was also based on a novel by Collins. Like all but one of the Hunger Games films so far, it is directed by Francis Lawrence.The events of Sunrise on the Reaping take place 24 years before The Hunger Games (and 40 years after The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes); they centre on Haymitch Abernathy, a tribute for the 50th Hunger Games, who is later to become Everdeen’s mentor (as played by Woody Harrelson in the original films). The film also stars Jesse Plemons as Plutarch Heavensbee (previously played by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Ralph Fiennes as a younger version of President Snow (originally played by Donald Sutherland).Lawrence is now appearing in Die My Love, directed by Lynne Ramsay, for which she has been nominated for a Golden Globe for best female actor. Hutcherson is in Five Nights at Freddy’s 2, which opened at No 1 at the North American box office on 5 December.Filming on Sunrise on the Reaping began in summer 2025and producer Nina Jacobsonsaid on social mediathat it had “wrapped” in November.

At one point, you can almost feel Trey Parker and Matt Stone taking a stand against the US governmentZach VasquezThu 11 Dec 2025 07.08 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 08.47 ESTShareComing off its most controversial and highest rated season in years,South Parkhad high expectations to meet with its season finale. Given how infamously down-to-the-wire its production schedule is – showrunners Matt Stone and Trey Parker often don’t start writing scripts until the week they’re set to air, working up to the 11th hour to turn in a completed episode (a method that caused them to miss a deadline earlier this year) – there was some question as to whether they would be able to tie everything up at all, let alone in a satisfying manner.The US government ruins Thanksgiving: it’s a South Park holiday specialRead moreMost viewers were probably anticipating a giant, apocalyptic climax to the various long-running storylines – chief among them Donald Trump’s attempts to kill his and his lover Satan’s soon-to-be-born spawn. Instead, Stone and Parker swerved expectations, delivering an introspective and ultimately melancholy climax, one that managed to balance hope and despair in equal measure, alongside the outrageous shock humour for which they’re famous.Only one of South Park’s main foursome appears in tonight’s episode. Stan Marsh, depressed over the horrible year he’s had (his father lost the family weed farm, forcing the Marshes to move in with their grandfather at a senior living facility), seeks solace in school guidance counsellor Jesus, only to find the son of God has joined Maga and “became all Christian”. (The darkest joke of the episode revolves around Jesus hitting rock bottom – literally, as he has begun physically abusing his girlfriend, Peggy Rockbottom.)Rebuffed by Jesus, Stan attempts to conjure up his old pal Mr Hankey, the Christmas Poo (last seen in a season 22 episode from 2018). His prayers are answered not by the friendly sentient turd, but instead the Woodland Critters, a group of adorable forest animals whose cute and jolly demeanour belies a satanic taste for murder and mayhem. They have come to usher in the birth of the antichrist in what they’ve dubbed “the crap out” (also the episode’s title).Meanwhile, their master, Satan, has uncovered the truth behind Trump and Vice-President JD Vance’s schemes to kill his baby, along with their recent sexual trysts, thanks to help from Towelie, the weed-addicted talking towel given to Trump earlier this season by a ketamine-crazed Randy Marsh, Stan’s father. Towelie, who has suffered the horrible indignity of being used as the president’s semen rag, has his own desire for revenge, so just as soon as he gets high, he and Satan pursue Trump and Vance looking for payback.View image in fullscreen‘Looking for payback’ … Satan in the South Park finale.Photograph: ParamountTrump and Vance, of course, have come to South Park to bust out of jail the secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, and the billionaire antichrist expert Peter Thiel. All parties converge in the town square for a showdown, only to be thwarted by Jesus on behalf of Trump. Satan’s water breaks and the action moves over to the local hospital, where doctors pronounce the child has died in the womb, the result of a suicide suspiciously similar to Jeffrey Epstein’s (the foetus supposedly hung itself, although there is a minute of ultrasound footage mysteriously missing). Once again, Trump has skirted all responsibility, avoiding any reckoning for his evil ways.As Trump parties at the White House and a devastated Satan packs his belongings and heads back to hell, Jesus sees the error of his ways, apologising to Stan and bestowing upon him an actual Christmas miracle in the form of his former family home. It’s the first time in several seasons that Stan’s house has been seen (his bedroom, replete with his Mad Max-inspired movie poster, is a sight for sore eyes), marking this as not just a season closer, but something of a reset.The episode is loaded with references to the show’s past, foremost among them the various references to “the spirit of Christmas”. That was the title of Stone and Parker’s two short films that served as the genesis of the show more than 30 years ago. South Park and Christmas are inextricably linked, so it’s only fitting that the finale to this already iconic season should also serve as its latest yuletide special.At the same time, Parker and Stone are clearly looking to the future, including their continuing fight on behalf of freedom of speech (when, late in the episode, Jesus declares: “Go ahead and sue me, I’m not going to be afraid any more,” it’s clearly Stone and Parker making a stand).Since this season kicked off with the pair’s$1.5bn (£1.1bn), 50-episode dealwith Paramount, we know there are 40 more episodes of South Park remaining (with nothing to indicate Parker and Stone won’t sign a new deal for future seasons later). And while it’s a fool’s errand to try to guess what next season has in store, we can probably assume the duo are not finished with Trump and his cronies. The destruction those in office have wreaked on the US has clearly inflamed the duo more than anything else in years, while, somewhat ironically, bringing those same characters into the show has also breathed new life into it.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkTelevisionAnimation on TVUS televisionTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a nauseatingly schmaltzy and nonsensicalRachel AroestiThu 11 Dec 2025 03.01 ESTLast modified on Thu 11 Dec 2025 11.50 ESTShareTrevor Bingley is not Mr Bean, but the two have a few things in common. For a start, they are both self-destructively single-minded when it comes to overcoming trivial annoyances. In Netflix’s 2022 seriesMan vs Bee, Bingley ended up building a fake explosive-laced hive to destroy the insect who refused to vacate the swish home he was house-sitting; for Bean, life consists almost exclusively of finding absurd solutions to minor problems. Both are pitiable figures: Bean because he’s a walking disaster zone; Bingley because he’s lonely and broke, having lost numerous jobs due to general ineptitude. Last but not least, they are both embodied by Rowan Atkinson, who bestows the pair with his distinctive brand of sprightly ungainliness.There are major differences, however. Bingley is a human who can talk, is aware of social niceties and has a backstory, which mainly features a teenage daughter he dotes on and gratingly refers to as “Sweetpea”. Bean, on the other hand, was essentially beamed in from space: some episodes of the original 1990s series open with him dropping from the sky bathed in an alien light source.Still, Man vs Bee – co-created by Atkinson and writer Will Davies – was essentially Bean reimagined for the streaming age: a comedy with a backdrop of aspirational luxury that managed to pull off the sort of scream-inducingly stressful and satisfyingly callback-laced farce the viewing public has lately been starved of. Man vs Bee also had a strong sentimental streak: clearly our hearts were supposed to bleed for Bingley, who wanted to take his daughter camping but had to cancel because of his new job. It wasn’t exactly a tragedy of epic proportions (until he ended up in prison, that is), but it did make sense. Do not expect the same for its follow-up.View image in fullscreenCosy British Christmascore … Man vs Baby.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/NetflixIn Man vs Baby, Bingley is back, struggling to make ends meet in a chocolate-box village in the home counties. It’s Christmas and he has just been let go as a primary school caretaker. His final job is to assist with the nativity (the opportunity to shamelessly channel Love Actually is not wasted). There, he discovers a baby on the doorstep; this must be the local child starring as Jesus in the play!Except, worryingly, it’s not – so when Bingley lands a last-minute, lucrative housesitting gig in central London, he tries to hand over the baby to the police (too busy to help) then social services, who assume the child is a figment of Bingley’s imagination after he temporarily misplaces it in his house. (Save your screams of incomprehension, there’s so much more senselessness to come.) There’s only one thing for it: smuggle the anonymous baby into the penthouse flat he’s looking after over the festive period and hope the authorities collect it sharpish.It goes about as smoothly as it possibly could. Bingley is – lest we forget for one sweetpea-ing second – a devoted father, so he broadly knows how to care for a baby. Yes, he makes eccentric choices (a cork is subbed in for a dummy), but generally lives harmoniously with the infant as he waits for a bizarrely unbothered Westminster social services to arrive. In fact, such is his newfound competence that slapstick and other laughs are thin on the ground; Bingley even whips up an elaborate Christmas dinner without breaking a sweat.One complaint critics had about Man vs Bee was the product placement (Miele, Waitrose). This time, Cadbury’s Heroes are spotlighted on multiple occasions. I had to laugh when Bingley gives a pack to the young family squatting in the basement of the opulent block of flats (the less said about this ludicrously mawkish subplot the better), and informs them that the confectionery produced by Britain’s best-loved chocolate brand is “really nice, actually!”. The difference here is that these product placements are far from the most cynical thing about Man vs Baby, which trades on Cosy British Christmascore in the most trite way possible, and delivers its celebration of festive togetherness with cloying warmth.Still, we watch because – as is seemingly mandatory for all streamer shows – there is a dark mystery at the core of Man vs Baby. Namely, who is being tormented by the loss of their child? Or worse, who isn’t?In the event, any troubling subtext is swerved via a deus ex machina that is quite frankly bananas. I wish the same could be said about the action itself, which never escalates into the grand, high-wire, socially subversive physical comedy we expect from Atkinson. Instead, we just get a nauseatingly schmaltzy and nonsensical dose of Christmas cheer helmed by a kind-hearted, capable man. Mr Bean would never.Man vs Baby is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are one or two nice lines and sharp moments but they are submerged in a treacly soup of sentimentality; in the end, I couldn’t get past the cartoony quasi-Richard Curtis characterisation and the weird not-quite-earthlingness of the people involved. Having said this, I am aware of having been first in the queue to denigrateWinslet’s Christmas film The Holiday, that is regarded by many as one of the most successful films of all time.Helen Mirren is the June of the title, an affectionate but sharp-tongued matriarch who is diagnosed with terminal cancer in the run-up to Christmas, and her entire quarrelling clan will have to assemble in her hospital room. June, with a kind of benign cunning, realises that she can use her last days as a cathartic crisis that will cure her adult children’s unspoken hurt. They are a stressed careerist (Winslet), a stay-at-home mum (Andrea Riseborough), a hippy-dippy natural birth counsellor (Toni Collette) and a troubled soul (Johnny Flynn), plus all their various kids. There is also June’s daft old husband Bernie, played by Timothy Spall, who likes a drink and can’t talk about his feelings, and whose scatterbrained goofiness has a sad origin. Stephen Merchant plays Riseborough’s lovably useless husband and a gentle hospital nurse, played by Fisayo Akinade, is the ensemble’s self-effacing guide to a wiser future.It is an impressive cast with everyone giving their considerable all, and in fact Winslet delivers a rather impressively restrained, controlled performance, and perhaps less broad than everyone else’s. She and Riseborough have a big setpiece confrontation scene out in the grim hospital corridor by the chocolate machine and it’s well-managed – you wouldn’t expect anything less with actors of that calibre; it’s better, I think, than the comparable scene between Flynn and Spall, which is resolved in a wordless musical montage. In the end, it is Bernie who realises that time is running out, and some liberties will have to be taken with the calendar if June, on her morphine drip, is to witness the Christmas Day nativity scene that June’s children and grandchildren have promised to put on for her.There’s nothing wrong with a weepie or big emotional moments, but for me Goodbye June is too unreal, too contrived in its sugary farewell.Goodbye June is in cinemas from 12 December, and on Netflix from 24 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFamily filmsKate WinsletHelen MirrenAndrea RiseboroughToni CollettereviewsShareReuse this content"

Joe Tracini’s script is set in the seaside town of Crabbington Sands where a pastel-dressed ensemble make merry with Aimee Leigh’s breezy choreography. Cinderella’s sisters, gruesome twosome Lou and Lav (cue toilet-flush effect), could have stepped out of an outrageously saucy postcard. Designer Kirsteen Wythe gifts them lurid costumes best seen with UV protection. They include a beach ball-shaped dress, a bucket-and-spade hat, fairground-ride frocks and wigs seemingly woven with fishing rope.Cinderella’s parents ran a local hotel that has been shuttered since she lost them, and she yearns for new adventures, a longing captured in an opening rendition of Natasha Bedingfield’s Unwritten. In the lead role, Georgia May Foote brings a big sister vibe to her crowdwork with the young audience that also underlines how Cinders sees the hopelessly devoted Buttons (Tracini) as a brother. But she is written to be a bit insipid, and there is little spark to her romance with a wannabe rock-star prince (Danny Hatchard, poised between buffoon and decent bloke).View image in fullscreenStraight from the end of the pier … Joe Tracini (centre) in Cinderella.Photograph: Richard Jarmy/Dinky PixThis is a panto that proves as trad as turkey with all the trimmings. There’s plenty to enjoy, principally Owen Evans and Kenny Moore as the wicked sisters (with no stepmother in sight), but also some jokes so bad they’re brilliant, a “Shoe Must Go On” gameshow featuring the fabled slipper and a chorus of monks singing Ring My Bell. Tracini is a treat in that last routine, left dangling from a rope as an “air friar”. When he dashes through the stalls he is mobbed by the kids.Hannah-Jane Fox gives us a pink-haired fairy godmother who is losing her magic touch, so that her couplets fail to find a closing rhyme. It’s a nice conceit in a script that is sparing with that panto chestnut of adults dabbling in youthful slang (“so cringe” mutters an unimpressed schoolchild in the row behind on one of those occasions).View image in fullscreenMore please … Jeevan Braich (left) and Danny Hatchard in Cinderella.Photograph: Richard Jarmy/Dinky PixIf I had one wish from that fairy godmother it would be for Jeevan Braich’s Dandini to get more of the spotlight. Braich, a breakout sensation fromStarlight Expresswho has a wonderfully rich voice, is given a big number after the interval that instantly raises the temperature. The plot peters out in that second half, which is in need of a big climactic set piece and hastily wraps up the story like a last-minute Christmas present. But Andrew Lynford’s bright, boisterous and warmly performed production leaves you not just with sore eyes and ringing ears, but a grin too.AtNorwich Theatre Royaluntil 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsPanto seasonTheatreComedy (Stage)Christmas showsComedy (Culture)ChristmasNorwichreviewsShareReuse this content"

But his music is quite different: a slippery layer cake of samples, multitudinous keys and lo-fi pop production, with Brown singing of a world where “the ebb and flow isn’t ebbing right”, be it in love or civic life. There is still room for an instant-classic R&B ballad though, in Tossed Away.Ben Beaumont-Thomas49Rochelle Jordan – Through the WallEverything isjust soon the British Canadian producer’s sixth album: expensively plush deep house suggesting club lights low, gleaming mirrors, potent looks igniting across the dancefloor. As much as the cold beat and ballroom flow of Ladida or the slapping “body, body, body” incantations of On 2 Something suggest a steadfast commitment to abandon, Jordan maintains impeccable poise and control throughout, whether in diva mode on Words 2 Say, breaking hearts on Bite the Bait, standing up for her needs on Doing It Too (“I’m not too much / You just give too little”) or patiently waiting for a frustrated lover to see the light on Ladida. Commanding, wise and committed to atmospheric excellence, party hosts don’t come better.Laura Snapes48Jerskin Fendrix– Once Upon a Time … in ShropshireView image in fullscreenHarebrained prog cabaret … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttJerskin Fendrix’s high-profile scores for the last three Yorgos Lanthimos films can’t really help prime you for the Midlands composer’s eccentrically beautiful second album, which pairs pristine musical theatre with the harebrained prog cabaret of Faith No More and (particularly) the under-sung Morphine. At first, Once Upon a Time … casts the rural bliss of growing up in 00s Shropshire in a golden light, a haven of getting ratted on Baileys and listening to Kanye on a farm, then having a lovely hungover group breakfast in someone’s kitchen. But the unexpected deaths he has experienced in recent years intrude to spoil paradise, eliciting feverish, absurdist expressions of grief – Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle is a bravura wig-out – and fathomless devastation from his camp, craggy voice. It demands a full theatrical production.LS47Clipping– Dead Channel SkyClipping frontman Daveed Diggs is best known for being in the original cast of Hamilton, and for all that this album is filled with noisy industrial rap, you can easily imagine it being successfully adapted for the Broadway stage. Dead Channel Sky is set in a cyberpunk dystopia not dissimilar to the scorched-sun “real world” of the Matrix, humming with janky tech and populated with fascists and freaky hedonists. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes render it in acid squiggles and revving breakbeats, while Diggs delivers his mutoid poetry like a prophet jacked up on some amphetamine he’s synthesised in a backstreet lab.BBTTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more46The Tubs – Cotton CrownIn different hands,the Tubs’ second album might be a crushing listen, and understandably so. In 2014, frontman Owen Williams’ mother, the songwriter and author Charlotte Greig,died by suicide. Grief, as these songs detail, made him a rubbish boyfriend. But Cotton Crown is often funny and ardent, and especially self-aware about how new love might feel like a life raft to a depressed mind ill-equipped to reciprocate: “Know it’s all in my brain / Caught in the middle of loving you and being insane,” Williams sings on Fair Enough. His striking voice, somewhere between Richard Thompson and Bob Mould, bolts through the band’s joyful jangle-pop. Clear students of the form, they’re virtuosos with zero patience for perfection, their riffs hurtling and plundering like seagulls going at a spilled catch as they vigorously rough you up with profundity.LS45Smerz – Big City LifeView image in fullscreenAn album of stilted beauty … Smerz.Photograph: Alva Le FebvreCatharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt feel like the pop girlies of the incredibly prolific and off-kilterCopenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory scene, making music that’s more outward-facing and arch than some of their insular and traditional (and equally great) classmates. Their second album lurches between throwing yourself at life – “you’re a girl in the city and you shouldn’t think twice”, they chant in deadpan harmony on Roll the Dice – and actually thinking twice quite a lot in existential spirals about purpose and desire. The dissonance between confidence and anxiety comes through in the album’s stilted beauty: one minute, their whorls of prepared piano carry you along like clouds amid perfectly turned pop-R&B and balladry; then they stab and stutter, like cracks in the pavement destined to trap your heels. In 2023, K-pop’s brightest hopes NewJeans hired them as co-writers: more pop bearing their imprint can only be a good thing.LS44Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendReleased almost exactly a year after her superstar-minting breakthrough Short n’ Sweet, and using a palette of soft rock, 80s pop, light disco and yearning country melodies, Carpenter added rich colour to one of pop’s most distinctive self-portraits. Her blatant sexuality is offset by an ironising sense of camp and a deep streak of cynicism, as she wonders whether to wrap her little finger round a series of hot but useless men. But whether dialling her exes while hopped up on “go-go juice” or being toxic for the sport of it (“you think that I’m gonna fuck with your head / well, you’re absolutely right”), Carpenter knows she’s part of the problem. Her fake helplessness at her own worst impulses is just one part of a formidable screwball comedy arsenal – she’s a Rosalind Russell for the dating app era.BBT43Jennifer Walton – DaughtersView image in fullscreenBolt from the blue … Jennifer Walton.Photograph: Liam CosfordThis Sunderland producer’s previous work included one EP of power electronics, one of antic club tracks, collabs with Aya and 96 Back as Microplastics, gigging with Kero Kero Bonito and a smattering of other credits. So her staggering, fully formed songwriterly debut was a total bolt from the blue. A swarming orchestral epic with shades of Julia Holter and Phil Elverum, it addressed her grief for her late father in serenely surrealist images – hitting a deer with a car in the middle of the night – and the painfully mundane realism of sitting in hospital corridors together. The standout Miss America combined both to stunning effect, a numbed incantation of everything Walton had seen on the US trip where she learned of her father’s diagnosis, the familiar now remade horribly mythic.LS42Erika de Casier– LifetimeErika de Casier’s fourth album updates the Y2K R&B template that fought for body-to-body sensuality in the face of rising digital creep. The old-school dial tones that pierce Lifetime’s rapt, liquid atmosphere work both as Janet homage and ironic sigh at how good those forebears had it when emotional warfare could only be conducted via pager: “Took a screenshot so / I could look at your pretty face all the time now / Without a sign that I’m online,” de Casier sings on earworm Delusional, a low-slung anthem for contemporary dating anxiety. “Hit midnight / Not even a text to hold me warm,” she rues on The Chase. That’s one of the most inviting things about Lifetime: its seductively cool surfaces conceal de Casier frantically kicking her feet below the surface, just like the rest of us.LS41Danny Brown – StardustThe Detroit rapper’s first post-rehab record totally disprovedhis fearsthat sobriety makes artists boring. On Stardust, Brown is still hard-wired with cartoonish verve, coupled with a genuinely touching sense of gratitude: “Sleeping real good at night ’cos I’m proud of myself,” he raps on Book of Daniel. While you probably wouldn’t describe someone who ponders “going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” as a wise elder, his hunger for life, opportunity and unmediated sensation blares through in how evidently gagged he is to centre younger producers from the digicore and hyperpop undergrounds: his unruly kids 8485, Jane Remover, Underscores, Frost Children and more make Stardust trip with glitch, rave, squealing riffs and overdriven noise. The rare record that makes you want to riot and shed a smiling single tear emoji.LS40-3140YHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsView image in fullscreenChews you up … YHWH Nailgun.Photograph: Steve GullickIn 21 minutes, the New York band’s debut chews you up and spits you out the other side in a tentacular whirr of rototoms, guitars that shriek and whine like neglected machinery, erratic tempos and frontman Zack Borzone’s choked-out vocals. The way the record lurches and reels brings to mind the classic horror film scene in which a human undergoes a violent, magnificent transformation into some sort of beast: much like Gilla Band’s Most Normal, 45 Pounds is a font of mutant rock pleasures.LS39Sudan Archives – The BPMThe title refers to the beats per minute of dance music, but for an album that is so totally alive, it surely also refers to a pounding heart. Sudan Archives (AKA Angeleno producer-singer-songwriter-violinist Brittney Parks) announces that “life’s a game and I got VR goggles” as she revels in the epicurean joys of sex, dancing, travel and music itself with an almost superhuman appetite: “The rest are cowards / They choose to eat and we devour.” It’s all done with breezy good humour but there’s something inspiring, even quietly political about this mindful rejection of the straight life. Her backings – full of pop-R&B and ethereal electro – also dart away from obvious mainstream paths.BBT38Ethel Cain – Willoughby Tucker, I’ll Always Love YouView image in fullscreenRomantic slowcore … Ethel Cain.Photograph: Dollie KyarnIt’s easy to see why US singer-songwriter Cain has become so adored. This album further sketches out the kind of storytelling universe that attracts footnote-writing fandoms: it’s a prequel to the events of her debut album Preacher’s Daughter, deepening the tale of Ethel and a cast of young peers as they fumble towards connection and understanding. Her moody, romantic slowcore is also perfect music for listening to on headphones as you walk around boring suburban streets wishing you could leave for bigger things. It’s also great for road trips: songs between five and 15 minutes that seem to make a long, slow blur of the pell-mell world outside.BBT37Olivia Dean – The Art of LovingThe British breakthrough of the year, as Dean – already doing decent business with her pleasant but rather neat debut Messy – reached a completely new level of songcraft. Bossa nova, folk and soul (classic and neo) are warmed together with beautiful production, evaporating any sense of pastiche to make a sound that’s both easy on the ear but distinctly Dean’s. Every song has a superb top line, Dean stretching them into loose jazzy shapes (Let Alone the One You Love, Lady Lady) or tightening them into brisk pop (Man I Need, Something Inbetween). But it’s the lyrics that make these songs so red-blooded: every stage of love, from the first flutter of flirtation to the adrenal shock of rejection, is made so true to life.BBT36Anna von Hausswolff – IconoclastsView image in fullscreenSense of awe … Anna von Hausswolff.Photograph: Philip SvenssonAnna von Hausswolff is no stranger to a monumental statement: her primary instrument is the pipe organ,a towering edifice of tin and arsenicthat offers her an ever-renewing sense of awe. But the Swedish composer’s sixth album goes bigger than ever, grappling with mortality, transcendence and evil in a series of stormy epics that also lash a little pop structure to her prow. “Oh, I’m breaking up with language / Oh, in search of something bigger than this,” she screams on Stardust, an exhilarating co-pilot on the path to absolution.LS35Bon Iver – Sable, FableIf, as Justin Vernon recently suggested, this is the last ever Bon Iver album, it’s a beautiful redemption arc: a loving send-up of his anxious, myopic sad-sack self blossoms into a radiant appreciation of possibility, sensuality, risk. Everything Is Peaceful Love has one of the year’s best refrains: “Damn if I’m not climbing up a tree right now!”, giddy with thrill and absolutely no idea of what to do when you get up there other than enjoy the view. And while there are gorgeously passionate songs here, it’s the ones about gracefully letting go of an unviable love that really underscore the admirable humility in Vernon’s bowing out.LS34Snocaps – SnocapsKatie Crutchfield’s full-throated transformation into country doyenne on her last couple of albums as Waxahatchee almost makes it easy to forget her indie-rock origins. Fourteen years since she and twin sister Allison wound down their teen band PS Eliot, the DIY stalwarts got back together – with a little help from MJ Lenderman and producer Brad Cook – and went back to brass tacks for their surprise album as Snocaps. What a treat it was: full of punchy indignation – “I could never just …coast!” they exclaim on Coast – crunchy ruminations and sing-songy contemplations of what it means to depend on and grow alongside one another. You’d follow them anywhere.LS33Amaarae – Black StarView image in fullscreenIrrepressible … Amaarae.Photograph: Salomé Gomis-TreziseWe all need an Amaarae in our lives: the person who, when you weakly protest that you’re a bit tired to go out, will soon have you holding a bottle of decanted rum in the back of an Uber, while alongside you she looks quizzically at a series of resealable plastic bags. “Ketamine, coke and molly,” she chants on Starkilla; “I spiked this drink so please open your mouth,” she tells her lover on Fineshyt. And this club-ready album from the irrepressible Ghanaian-American pop star ends up being a sensual body high, as she chases sex and glamour into the ends of the night.BBT32Perfume Genius – GloryWith typical grace and humour Mike Hadreas sends up his self-defeating tendencies on his seventh album, and wonders how old you have to be to escape those lifelong patterns: like the contradiction of struggling to face the world while also fantasising about violence and romanticising “all the poems I’ll get out” of it. It feels apt that Glory starts with the western twang of It’s a Mirror, suggesting a fixed, brawny masculine archetype – then breaks it down over the course of the record, a gothic, celestial voyage into the interior, and the latest addition to a uniquely beautiful American songbook.LS31Horsegirl – Phonetics On and OnView image in fullscreenFinely tuned … Horsegirl.Photograph: Ruby FayeSpindly rock à la the Velvets and the Raincoats is as spartan in its constituent parts as it is high on reward, and Chicago trio Horsegirl demonstrated the inexhaustible pleasures of this 60-year-old form on their second album. With production from Cate Le Bon, they wove magic from just a few thrumming guitar and bass notes and Nora Cheng’s nonchalant, near-spoken vocals, as well as a knack for melodic hooks as finely turned as intricate woodwork: the bittersweet, skipping chorus of Information Content is an all-timer.LS30-2130Oklou – Choke EnoughTrance, medieval polyphony and Y2K pop may seem like odd bedfellows, but French singer-producer Oklou cast them all in a dawn-like haze on her gorgeous debut album, flowing these distinct disciplines together until they swooped and soared like a flock of starlings. Choke Enough was no academic exercise, either, with standout pop moments including Take Me By the Hand with Bladee – a winsome conjuring of how Alice Deejay might sound in collaboration with a piping minstrel.LS29Jacob Alon – In LimerenceView image in fullscreenRustling with life … Jacob Alon performing at the ZYN Rolling Stone UK Awards, in London’s Roundhouse.Photograph: Sue Moore/Hogan Media/ShutterstockOne of the star-making moments of the year was at the Mercury prize, as Scottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon reduced the arena audience to a hush with just a voice and an acoustic guitar (though there were delighted whoops when a call of “free Palestine” was folded into their rendition of Fairy in a Bottle). It hopefully brought a broader audience to their debut album In Limerence, which has shades of Adrianne Lenker, Jeff Buckley and even Paul McCartney’s cadences to its unguarded indie-folk. It would have been easy to make this music blandly beautiful, but Alon and producer Dan Carey keep it rustling with life, as they reach for a burbling synth, trumpet improvisation or dusty-sounding drum kit.BBT28KeiyaA – Hooke’s LawThe title of the Chicago producer’s second album references the law of physics that reflects how stretch is proportional to load, how a spring always bounces back when tested within its elastic limit. The whistlestop Hooke’s Law expands and contracts accordingly as KeiyaA’s trifles with loss and romantic disappointment find their embodiment in racing breakbeats and collagist chaos one minute, gorgeous, soul-weary stillness – as with the liquid Stupid Prizes – the next. Listening can feel like being pleasurably blitzed with sensation, with each repeat revealing new details: an invitation to submit to KeiyaA’s masterful grip.LS27Wet Leg – MoisturizerIn 2022 they released one of the 21st century’s biggest indie debuts, which scored a UK No 1 and Grammy and Brit awards. The pressure was there for the follow-up, but not only did it top the charts again and earn another couple of Grammy noms, it had even more swagger and heart. “You wanna fuck me, I know, most people do,” Rhian Teasdale shrugs on Mangetout, and she actively intimidates a lustful bloke on Catch These Fists – but much of the album is given over to her wonderment at falling in love. “I’ll be your Davina, I’m coming to get you … I’ll be your Shakira, whenever, wherever”, she sings: great new vows for millennial weddings.BBT26Wolf Alice – The ClearingView image in fullscreenSomething symphonic … Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice performing at Manchester Arena.Photograph: Andy Von Pip/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“English bands are so hesitant to ever admit ambition, but I am ambitious with this record,” Wolf Alice’s drummerJoel Amey saidas The Clearing was announced – and sure enough, this was a huge step up and out for a band who were already one of British indie’s biggest. There’s something symphonic about the heft of it and not just because of the string sections, thanks to superb production by Greg Kurstin: the bass and toms are heavy yet warm, the piano pounding yet not overbearing. Ellie Rowsell sings about suitably big themes, too, from universe-bending love on Leaning Against the Wall (“it really, really made the room sing, the way you said my name”), invaluable friendship on Just Two Girls, and The Sofa’s uplifting manifesto for being wild and indolent instead of toeing the line.BBT25Wednesday – BleedsThe North Carolina band’s sixth album is littered with endings, some violent – the title of Carolina Murder Suicide tells you all you need to know – some devastatingly mundane, as Karly Hartzman examined the cracks that led to a long relationship’s end. Her unique gaze unites both, noticing the details and dynamics that other songwriters might write off as inconsequential: like the “mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail” at a wake in Wound Up Here (By Holdin On). Full of screaming noise and riffs that evoke knee-sliding through the mud, as well as moments of unexpected sweetness, Bleeds shows the fullest picture of her band yet.LS24Titanic – HagenView image in fullscreenUncontainable euphoria … Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta of Titanic.Photograph: Janet ChauThere can be few faster-evolving ensembles than that of Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta, who in just two albums have leapt from sparkling cabaret jazz to … whatever the uncontainable euphoria of Hagen is. It’s a record that vaults from blast beats to choral beauty, eerie splendour to nervy cacophonies, like nothing else you’ve heard. Despite these bold stylistic clashes, it hangs together beautifully, thanks also to Fratti’s spectacular voice, as capable of cirrus-like delicacy as parched sharpness.LS23Cate Le Bon – Michelangelo DyingWhere two of this year’s most prominent breakup albums were savage (Lily Allen) or spectacular (Rosalía), Welsh innovator Cate Le Bon’s hypnotically murky seventh album reflected the circular sadness of love faltering – the catch-22 of wanting to escape heartbreak while knowing that letting go means relinquishing something that was once profound. Michelangelo Dying contains some of her very best choruses and melodies, powerful enough to penetrate the album’s billowing haze of guitar, sax and synths, like a hand reaching out in the dark.LS22Little Simz – LotusView image in fullscreenWider reckoning … Little Simz performing at the Co-op Live arena in Manchester.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianSimz’s sixth album came amid a dispute with the Sault producer Inflo – she has sued him for allegedly failing to repay a loan – and a couple of tracks target him in all but name (“You talk about God when you have a God complex / I think you’re the one that needs saving”). But Simz seems to be having a wider reckoning: she revels in how far she’s come from once just having “a dream and a pushbike”, and reflects on self-preservation, creative frustration and – in a gorgeous, naturalistic back-and-forth with Wretch 32 – push-pull family dynamics.BBT21John Glacier – Like a RibbonFor all that you can link her to trip-hop and cloud rap, what British MC has ever really sounded like this? It would be easy to call Glacier monotone, but in truth her careful, even flow holds so much musicality: her deliberately limited melodic and rhythmic range means that the subtle distinctions in her vocals are fascinating, as she goes from bored to wry to boastful to poignant within one-degree turns on the emotional thermostat. The grainy, faintly corrupted beats are superb, but it’s that delivery, and her lyrics themselves – stoic and even amused as life blows her from place to place – which make this album an all-timer in UK rap.BBT20-1120Aya – Hexed!A series of surreal vignettes confronting addiction, panic and the challenges of growing up queer, Aya Sinclair’s experimental electronic masterwork is a wind-whipped dash around the towns and moors of Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. From the rotor blade-whomp of Peach to the infernal pattering snares on Navel Gazer, her sound design hits you like a ton of feathers: a surreal, destabilising flurry of detail. And the lyrics, done as careful mutters or sarky sing-song, are world-class. Her poetry revels in multiple meanings – is she saying “Flemish” or “phlegmish”? – and in the plasticity of language, rhyme and even lived experience, whether retelling a toxic relationship (“Couple rows so we could pop our cysts / as though the pus’d bust right out of the tryst”) or evoking the feeling of being totally cut adrift: “Abseil away another day supine inside the bag.”BBT19Clipse – Let God Sort Em OutView image in fullscreenRich with wisdom … Malice and Pusha T of Clipse.Photograph: Cian MooreThey may have been outdone by Oasis as 2025’s most anticipated fraternal comeback, but there was still considerable excitement around the return of Gene and Terrence Thornton, AKA Clipse’s Malice and Pusha T. After making two of the best albums in 00s rap, Malice found God and left Pusha to it. But on returning, Malice’s mic tone – which always had a sort of ancient, oaken majesty to it – felt rich with wisdom, while Pusha, who in the interim had beefed Drake to hugely entertaining effect, still had his nose for a scrap, this time with Travis Scott. Together, they advocated for their own brilliance and for what they see as a better class of rap, sometimes at the same time: “They content-create, I despise that / I create content then they tries that.”BBT18Big Thief – Double InfinityAfter their bassist Max Oleartchik left the group, Big Thief pressed on as a trio but brought in a number of auxiliary musicians, resulting in an album that sounds like it could have been worked up around the campfire of a utopian off-grid commune. These are some of the American band’s best, biggest-hearted songs to date, with the type of easy facility with melody – and equally easy access to their emotions – that can’t be taught. Take Grandmother, in which frontperson Adrianne Lenker surveys our collapsing world and flawed humanity, and decides on the singalong chorus: “Gonna turn it all into rock’n’roll.” In many other hands this would be trite, but as with so much of Big Thief’s music, the purity of intention makes it life-affirming.BBT17Alex G – HeadlightsView image in fullscreenA new frontier … Alex G.Photograph: Chris MaggioWhat constitutes integrity? Working for love or money? Freedom or obligation to others? On his first album for a major label, standing at a new frontier of success, Alex G weighs these existential questions in appropriately vast, beautiful indie-rock epics, some breathless with anxiety (Spinning), others sardonic (Real Thing) or severe (Headlights). Despite the very contemporary, very Alex G touches – take the sprite-like voices and distortion of Bounce Boy – there’s a comforting solidity to this record that makes it feel as though it’s existed for ever, sharing the same spooked twilight as the best of Yo La Tengo and REM.LS16Pulp – MoreThe anticipation of a reunion album rarely measures up to the often dismal results. Perhaps the key is to spend a solid chunk of years playing together again, as Pulp did, before risking putting anything down on record. “I exist to do this / Shouting and pointing,” Jarvis Cocker sang on comeback single Spike Island; anyone who’s seen Pulp in recent years can attest that he has lost none of his calligraphic physical flair. Nor, as the magnificent More proves, has his gimlet eye for the grubby disappointments of middle age diminished. Life apparently feels no less of a charade at 62 than early adulthood did back in the 90s, a fact he sells as both anticlimax and a weird kind of comfort: if that’s the case, the unvarnished love songs and heartfelt stands against commodification suggested, you might as well stick it all on the line.LS15Turnstile – Never EnoughView image in fullscreenUncomplicated thrills … Turnstile in concert in Guadalajara, Mexico.Photograph: Medios y Media/Getty ImagesIs it hardcore punk or not? As this dull debate brewed on comment sections and Discord servers, the rest of the world got on with the business of just enjoying the uncomplicated thrills on Turnstile’s latest. Certainly, Seein’ Stars sounds like 90s Duran Duran, the epic title track could be played as NFL teams run on to the field and even the hardcore-paced Dull and Solo have a sheen to them. But for every frowning punk purist, you had 10 more lining up to pile into the pit with smiles a mile wide.BBT14Deftones – Private MusicThis was the US alt-metallers’ first album back after serendipitously getting a huge new following via TikTok, particularly for their sweeter, shoegazier material. But rather than court that audience by cynically remaking Sextape 11 times over, they instead created a balletic cyborg of a record. The riffs could put a dent in concrete masonry, but the groove-metal rhythms are light-footed and, as ever, vocalist Chino Moreno sets out even wider tonal possibilities. It’s as if waves of pain and relief pass across his spirit as he goes from dry croaks to thunderous denouncements to blissful clean singing.BBT13Suede – AntidepressantsThree decades since their debut and five albums into the second phase of their career, Suede sound as impassioned and vital as they ever have. Brett Anderson’s voice is a long way from the nasal sneer of Animal Nitrate all those years ago: it’s now rounder and deeper in colour, reminiscent of Echo and the Bunnymen’s Ian McCulloch, but the core Suede theme – humanity in all its reckless and sexy brokenness – is still there. Playing post-punk with a Britpop grandeur, Anderson and co reckon with the fleeting nature of existence (“Formless as a cloud / Weightless as a sound”) and the caprices of brain chemistry, but with a sense of optimism, even triumph.BBT12Jim Legxacy – Black British Music (2025)View image in fullscreenMore assured … Jim Legxacy.Photograph: Igoris TarranHis previous mixtape Homeless N*gga Pop Music was at No 42 in our 2023 albums list; rapper-producer Jim Legxacy jumps up the rankings as his place in British rap becomes more and more assured. Beats-wise, he defines the joyous anything-goes energy of the current UK underground, expertly applying chipmunk effects to samples, adding funny DJ-style vocal tags (“turn that mediocre bullshit off, we’re listening to Jim Legxacy right now!”) and even making a left turn into high-tempo pop-rock for ’06 Wayne Rooney. There’s more of a mournful cast to the lyrics though, as he works through grief for his late sister, and confronts the lingering effects of his impoverished, fatherless childhood.BBT11Jade – That’s Showbiz Baby!Pop’s trickiest manoeuvre is crossing the divide from successful group to solo career. After departing Little Mix, Jade Thirlwall didn’t so much jump it as pirouette across: her multi-part debut solo single Angel of My Dreams was completely nuts, impossible to ignore and spent 20 weeks on the UK chart. Could a whole album match up? From trashy ballroom house (It Girl) to disco-funk (Fantasy, Headache), Robyn-esque sad bangers (Plastic Box, Self Saboteur) and waltz-time ballads (Natural at Disaster), she certainly has the range, not to mention smart and sweary lyrics – rhyming Edward Enninful with experimental is a neat encapsulation of what moves her. It’s her voice that really sets it all apart, though: as you’d expect of a talent show graduate turned longtime pop star, it remains stunning on a technical level, but Thirlwall also brings a whole West End musical’s worth of emotion.BBT10-6 coming soonCome back tomorrow for the next 10 albums in the countdown!

It cannot throw a pot, blow glass, beat metal, weave bamboo or turn wood. Perhaps, when it has assumed absolute control of human consciousness and the machinery of mass production, it will be able to. But for now, throwing a vessel and weighing its heft in your hand, or carving a tray and sizing up its form with your eye are still the preserve of skilled craftspeople, using techniques their distant ancestors would recognise.View image in fullscreenLaconic simplicity … Hyakkō: 100+ Makers from Japan.Photograph: Jeremie Souteyrat/Japan House LondonOn show at London’sJapanHouse is the work of more than 100 pairs of eyes and hands, constituting an overwhelming profusion of human creativity, corralled into an exhibition of laconic simplicity. About 2,000 objects – bowls, trays, cups, metalwork, glassware and some perplexing bamboo cocoons – are grouped according to their makers on long, softly lit display tables. At first glance, you might think you have stumbled into an especially refined John Lewis homeware department, but then you notice the delicate black and red lacquer work, the gleaming gold on the inside of a perfectly shaped sake cup, the intricacy of the bamboo and some eccentrically shaped vessels, like alien seedpods, that look like ceramics but turn out be a kind of petrified leather.Craftsmanship that gives practical and beautiful shape to raw materials has been part of Japanese life for centuries. Yet historically, the products of formal crafts such asurushi(lacquerware) and metalwork were conceived as costly artefacts to be admired, well out of reach of ordinary people. It wasn’t until the 1920s that the folk craft movement, known asmingei,refocused attention on the unassuming beauty of hand-crafted utilitarian objects.Today, despite the prevalence of industrial production, artisans across Japan continue to create everyday utensils and vessels, employing traditional methods that respond to the particular qualities of their chosen material. No two crafts are the same, and each artisan brings a unique imprimatur to the process of creation.In a two-year odyssey, the exhibition’s curator, Nagata Takahiro, travelled the length of Japan, seeking out craftspeople hunkered in country sheds and city flats, shaping clay, beating metal and working wood, quietly getting on with creating. The aim was to get a sense of the numbers and experiences of people involved in sustaining traditional Japanese crafts. It turned out to be an extensive and thriving network, with artisans using social media to showcase their wares and connect with buyers, galleries, craft fairs and other makers.View image in fullscreenBeauty and strength … works on display in Hyakkō: 100+ Makers from Japan.Photograph: Jeremie Souteyrat/Japan House LondonShinichi Moriguchi spends his time crafting chestnut wood trays known aswagatabon,traditional utensils dating from the Edo period with distinctive chisel marks inscribed vertically across the wood grain. Chestnut wood is especially resistant to water and decay and the chiselled lines resemble rippling waves, conjuring a sense of beauty and strength. No two surfaces are alike. Moriguchi lives in Kyoto and runs an atelier in the surrounding mountains, teaching students the craft ofwagataboncarving. “It only requires simple tools – a wooden mallet and chisels – so anyone can learn,” he says.Before becoming a metalsmith,Yumi Nakamuraworked in interior design, so her approach to craft is inflected by a strong awareness of space and how objects appear in settings. Her kettles and tea vessels are exquisitely sculptural, with slim, exaggeratedly curved handles. Although the process of hammering and shaping sheets of metal can be arduous, she marvels at how objects can be drawn out from inanimate matter. “Unlike ceramics or glass, metalwork lets you keep touching the form,” she says. “You can keep hammering for ever, so deciding when to stop is crucial.” Reflecting different strengths and physiques, the hammer marks also embody the maker’s character.View image in fullscreenCherishable … Hyakkō: 100+ Makers from Japan.Photograph: Jeremie Souteyrat/Japan House LondonAmplifying the now cliched notion ofwabi-sabi, which has come to be routinely applied to anything involving weathered natural materials, the exhibition featuresa glossary of termsthat crystallise singularly Japanese concepts, such asanbai,meaning “balance” or “adjustment”. Originally it was used to describe the seasoning of food, but here it relates to how the quality of an object hinges on its form and colour.Shibui(literally “bitter”) means subtly elegant, whileibitsusarefers to “irregularity”, which is to be cherished as evidence of the human hand, imparting an expressive quality that cannot (yet) be reproduced by machines.Short films document some of the craftspeople at work, showing how base materials are effortfully transformed into elegant artefacts. As with the potter’s wheel television intervals of yore, there is a seductively ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) quality to watching how a bowl or spoon is made, but the films also convey a wider sense of the artisans’ lives, their daily routines and their locales, since the nature of place also shapes approaches to design.Specialising in porcelain, ceramic artists Yamamoto Ryōhei and Hirakura Yuki share a home and studio in Arita, in western Kyushu, where porcelain was first produced in Japan more than 400 years ago. Near their home is the site of the oldest kiln in Arita. Discarded pottery shards are strewn around the ground, yet despite their age, the fragments retain a surprising freshness. The couple began to research and replicate historic pieces, refining their making techniques and gradually developing a style that became their own. “The human eye is always searching for something,” says Ryōhei. “When you’re unsure whether you’re seeing a design or not, your imagination starts working.”What emerges is how intrinsically and intimately craft is part of human existence, passed down through generations, changing yet somehow unchanged. Programming director Simon Wright quotes a line from the 13th-century Japanese writer Kamo no Chōmei: “The flow of the river never ceases, and yet the water is never the same.”Hyakkō: 100+ Makers from Japan, Japan House, London, until 10 MayExplore more on these topicsCultureJapanCraftArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

The first was the centrepiece of her earliest exhibition as a solo artist in 1989,where she debuted her groundbreaking, technically complex photomontages in which dizzying patterns are woven from repeating imagery. It’s a self-portrait where she peers uncertainly from a mandala made from tiny posturing male nudes, “pressed in by men” as Kulik puts it.The second was made nearly a decade later in 1997, the year that that artistic leap into the unknown was given the ultimate public affirmation and she represented her country at the Venice Biennale. This time she’s an assertive queen, posed like Elizabeth I, resplendent with a ruff, wide-skirted and sleeved gown, embellished with decorative patterns of those naked men.The first big English-language monograph of Kulik’s unique output traces this fascinating journey, as she confronts the forces that oppress and the possibility of emancipation – politically, artistically, and in her own life, too. She was 42 when she started on her path to becoming one of Poland’s most significant artists. It was the late 1980s and a time of new beginnings: communism was collapsing and her relationship with the creative and romantic partner she’d been with since art school was over. Having grown frustrated as part of a collective where her chief role was to document the activities of others, she found herself at a turning point. “I needed to find a reason to make art again,” she recalls. “I was in a bad way psychologically.” Yet gradually she began to feel “free to do things without discussion. I started to explore myself, my roots in my family and to create archives of my own.”Raised in a military barracks, Kulik had grown up between two worlds: the domestic life of her seamstress mother, and the military, ideologically on-message outdoor realm of her soldier father. “The collision of these factors in my work is crucial, the balance between soft and sharp elements,” she says. She went back to the beginnings of her art education too, first sketching poses from art history, then photographing them. Upending the classic gender split between male artist and female muse, she worked with a young artist-model, Zbigniew Libera, amassing an archive of more than 700 nude images of him in a few years. Using a pioneering technique, she began creating photomontages, with multiple exposures of her negatives on photosensitive paper so that a single work can hold hundreds of images.“At first I didn’t plan to use them in such complex compositions,” she recalls. “I started to compare [the art historical] gestures with those of Mao or Lenin. It was a straightforward path from there.” In her work, this language of patriarchal might – especially the political or religious kind – is shown as a repeating pattern that seems to coat everything, like the patterned carpets that the artist’s father used to cover the floor, walls and tables in his Warsaw home.Yet the posturing of history’s power-players is literally stripped bare, with a tiny naked man who strikes a pose again and again, be it the spear-bearing Greek hero, a dead Christ, a fallen angel from William Blake or a Soviet revolutionary staring towards a bright communist tomorrow. Against this male mass she pits herself, an individual woman holding her own at the centre. “I’d felt like I was hammered like a nail my whole life,” she says. “I took symbolic weapons and tried to react to that.”Body politics: five works by Zofia KulikView image in fullscreenZofia Kulik’s Self Portrait With a Flag (I), 1989.Photograph: © Zofia KulikSelf Portrait With a Flag (I), 1989This landmark work marks the first time when, in her early 40s, Kulik began experimenting with self-portraiture, making a conscious break with her previous collaborative work. The red flag refers back both to the collapse of communism and that earlier period in her own life, when it had been used in a group performance.The Splendour of Myself (IV), 2005, main imageThis is one of a series of works begun in 1997 that riff on portraits of Elizabeth I. Kulik’s interest in paintings of the Tudor monarch was sharpened when she realised that they revealed the tacit influence of Catholic Spain through English court fashions.View image in fullscreenDetail from Zofia Kulik’s All the Missiles Are One Missile, 1993.Photograph: © Zofia KulikAll the Missiles Are One Missile, 1993This is a detail from a huge patterned photomontage that Kulik exhibited at the Venice Biennale in 1997.

Among them was the way most trains required me to sit sideways to the direction of travel, as on a fairground waltzer. Directly opposite me was another person or an empty seat, and while I knew not to stare at people, I did stare at the seats – at their woollen coverings, called moquette. I have since written two books about them, the first nonfiction,Seats of London, and now a crime novel, The Moquette Mystery.I was attracted to moquette firstly because it, like me, came from Yorkshire (most of it back then was woven in Halifax), and whereas many foreign metros have seats of plastic or steel, moquette made the tube cosy. Yet it seemed underappreciated. The index of the standard history of the tube, for instance, proceeds blithely from Moorgate to Morden.View image in fullscreenBarman moquette fabric, featuring London landmarks, on the Northern line.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianA moquette might last a decade or more on a particular vehicle, coinciding with a Londoner’s formative years, the design evoking forever after those tube rides to triumphs and disasters. For generation Z, the resonant one is likely to be Barman, introduced in 2010 to replace a range of moquettes deemed too diffuse. Therefore, our two-hour moquette tour begins on one of the many lines to use Barman: the Northern line, from Leicester Square to Charing Cross.The landmarks depicted seem suffused in a haze of blue rain, and the harder you stare, the more the top of Big Ben becomes Battersea Power StationBarman is named after Christian Barman, publicity officer toFrank Pickwho, as vice-chair of London Transport in the 1930s, commissioned the roundel symbol, the tube map, Charles Holden’s subtly modernist station architecture and many posters and moquettes. Barman was designed by Wallace Sewell (Harriet Wallace-Jones and Emma Sewell) and, unusually for moquette, it’s figurative; but it’s also mysterious. The landmarks it depicts seem suffused in a haze of blue rain, and the harder you stare, the more the top of Big Ben becomes Battersea Power Station – and is that Southwark cathedral looming ghostly behind the dome of St Paul’s?At Charing Cross, we change on to the Bakerloo, which has a darker version of Barman, the same landmarks at night, perhaps.The sombre black, grey and brown colour scheme suits the crepuscular mood of these elderly trains; it is also historically valid. In the early 1920s, the first moquette widely applied on the underground – called Lozenge – was the colour of dried mud, a capitulation to the dirtiness of clothes in those days before widespread dry-cleaning.View image in fullscreenA memorial at Piccadilly Circus to Frank Pick, who commissioned many moquettes.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianIn the late 1930s, Frank Pick commissioned brighter moquettes from leading textile designers, including Enid Marx and Marion Dorn. He favoured red and green – red symbolising the town, green the country – and he considered green serene. My novel is set in this golden age of the underground, epitomised by the lambent glamour of Piccadilly Circus station concourse, which features a sort of shrine to Pick, showing his watchwords in brass on the marble wall. These range from “Utility” to “Beauty”, and moquette has usually been filed under the first word, but the second applies to the best of it.We go from Picadilly Circus to Green Park on the Piccadilly line – Barman again, but with a richer blue than on the Northern line. It reflects the line colour and the dark blue of the Underground roundel bar, which a transport designer once described to me as “the reassuring colour of an old-fashioned police lamp”.The Victoria line moquette uses multiple V-shapes, evoking she who was not amusedAt Green Park, we take the Victoria line to Oxford Circus. This unnamed moquette uses multiple V-shapes, evoking she who was not amused. The Vs are white, which shows the dirt, but the radiated light suggests diamond facets and alleviates the claustrophobia of this line which never comes above ground.At Oxford Circus, we observe some Central line trains, waiting for a lucky break. Most have Barman, but some refurbished trains have a new red, black and grey moquette called Tuppenny, the Central having once been “the Tuppenny Tube”. It is reminiscent of a Central line moquette of the late 80s, my “home” line back then, when the red and black seemed consoling, like a coal fire.View image in fullscreenThe new Elizabeth line seats have about eight colours.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI suggested to Paul Marchant, head of product design at Transport for London, that Tuppenny was “retro”. “Yes,” he said, “I was on holiday when it was commissioned!” A joke (I think), but moquette is meant to keep pace with London; it is not supposed to be retro. Currently, only two Central line trains have Tuppenny, so the odds are against our sitting on it while heading west to our next stop, Bond Street.Here, we board the Elizabeth line for Paddington. Most moquettes have four colours, but on the luxurious, hi-tech Lizzy line, it has about eight. The designers (Wallace Sewell) were briefed to incorporate royal purple, a strident shade unlikely to be “serene” if emphasised. So it’s subsumed here amid others, representing connecting lines and suggesting train movements digitally represented in some futuristic signal box.At Paddington, we board a Circle or Hammersmith & City line train heading east. We are now on one of the “cut-and-cover” lines just below street level. If you don’t know which lines are sub-surface, the moquette on those trains tells you. The colours of the small rectangles set against a black background denote the Circle, H&C, District and Metropolitan lines.View image in fullscreenMoquette cushions at the London Transport Museum.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianMoquette has a pile – tufts – that can be left as loops or cut for a more vivid colour and a velvety texture, and this sub-surface one is entirely cut, so it is not as hard-wearing as others. The seats near the doors (the most popular ones) are badly worn, with the backing fabric “grinning through”, to use the technical term. I am assured there are “big plans” to address this.At King’s Cross we head south on the Piccadilly line to Covent Garden and the London Transport Museum. In the cafe, we sip the museum’s excellent coffee while sitting on seats covered with their own special moquette, which is red and green in homage to Frank Pick. In the museum shop, moquettes past and present are for sale as bags, cushions, pouffes and so on.That Londoners are willing to pay to have a symbol of public transport in their homes is a tribute to the legacy of Pick. As the man himself said: “The quality of our surroundings contributes to the quality of our own lives.”Andrew Martin’s novel, The Moquette Mystery, is published by Safe Haven.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As I said at this time last year, don’t waste your time and money on fancy-dan wine kit and gadgets: I am speaking for myself here, of course, but a lot of it will ultimately find its way to a kitchen drawer, never to be seen again. I am always running out of corkscrews, however, andthe one from St Johnis iconic and monochrome, or maybe something sleek and silver fromFortnum & Mason, perhaps?When it comes to gifting wine, it’s a good idea to draw on the crowdpleasers to fit that specific bill. For sparkling wines, crémant is a cost-effective option if you want the delight of fizz but don’t have deep pockets. Champagne, even in a supermarket, teeters around the £50-mark these days, though there are some cute gift boxes out there to warrant the expense:Piper Heidsieck’s fire hydrant caseis fun and camp, and there’s no better excuse than Christmas to break outVeuve Cliquot’s puffy bottle holder.But if buying booze feels like too much of a minefield (drinks aficionados can be exacting types), some good stemware is a nice option, because it’s thoughtful, good-quality stuff can be had at every price point, and it’s a gift that will allow a wine lover to get the most out of wine they already have. To that end, I really,reallyrecommendthe stemware from Zara Home: most ready-to-buy fashion homeware sections are all thick glass and style over ergonomics, but much of Zara’s range is chic and purpose-built. ItsBohemia crystal plain glass, for instance, made up my first home set, and is a snip at £4.99 each. With a wide base to swirl your wine and a narrow rim to collect the aromas, it’s a great vessel to enjoy your wine in. You’ll also find matching tumblers and flutes online.At the crazier end, Maison Balzac makes some truly zany stemware designed with your favourite beverages in mind: blown-glass chillies, for instance, adornone short tumbler, surely created to house a spicy margarita. And it’s spenny, yes, but theoriginal universal wine glassfrom Richard Brendon’s collaboration with Jancis Robinson is an excellent luxury option, too. Emphasis on the luxury here – they’re £96 for two – but if anyone is looking to get me anything for Christmas, my housemate has managed to smash two. I’ll also accept gift cards.Four drinks gifts I’d be happy to getPiper Heidsieck Code Rouge Gift Set£65.99 Selfridges, 12%.So silly and brilliant: Piper’s classic cuvée in a container shaped like a fire extinguisher.Whitebox Cocktails Spicy Marg Cracker£12 Whitebox Cocktails, 20.5%.

What’s remotely Christmassy – or German – about Dubai-chocolate churros and Korean fried chicken, I grumble as I drag the dog (who enjoys all such things) around their perimeters.Hamburg’s markets, however, which I was myself dragged around last weekend, are averydifferent story. For a start, the city has many of them, mainly fairly small – and some, such as the “erotic Christmas market” in St Pauli, with a particular theme. What they all have in common is the range of food and drink on offer … though let’s gloss hurriedly over the phallic gingerbread shapes on sale at St Pauli in favour of the eye-opening range of glühwein (white, rosé, kirsch-spiked, blueberry-flavoured), which was far more appealing.Though I am familiar with it as a concept –mulled winewith an umlaut in it – from now on I shall insist that everyone refers toHenry Dimbleby’s white versionas Weißer Glühwein in tribute (if you’d prefer to delegate the mulling,Joanne Gould tips Waitrose’s mulled roséas one of her festive favourites). I also enjoyed eierlikör, which is essentiallyeggnog; if you, like me, enjoy getting drunk on custard, it’s worth making your own – and my recipe can be given a more Germanic feeling by using brandy and white rum instead of the whisky, and replacing the nutmeg with vanilla extract. (You probably don’t need instructions on how to make a boozy hot chocolate, buthere’s some guidance from Tony Naylor anyway.)View image in fullscreenVery giftable … Meera Sodha’s zimtsterne.Photograph: Robert Billington/The GuardianThe food in Hamburg quickly became as familiar as the drinks menu. Naturally, there werebratwurstgrilled over an open flame, often accompanied by an avalanche ofthe country’s beloved curry sauce, and sides of salmon (Hamburg is very much a fish-eating city), but also käsespätzle (Yotam Ottolenghi has a deliciously cheesy-looking recipe) and the wonderfully-namedkartoffelpufferpotato pancakes, plus more recent innovations such ashandbrot, or dough balls stuffed with various fillings that almost always involve cheese – and, more weirdly, crumble. (You can’t get away from crumble at the moment, but none of it looks as good as the school stuff to me.)Although most people seemed to be there to eat, drink and be merry, the point of these markets is ostensibly shopping and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the food stalls were my favourites. Christmas cookies are a big deal in Germany;Luisa Weiss has some lovely ideas, while Anna Jones put her own stamp onsome citrus, honey and almond lebkuchen; and just last weekend Meera Sodha sharedher friend’s grandma’s recipe for zimtsterne. I brought a selection home, along with some solid, marzipan-stuffed stollen bites, which my stodgy northern heart will always prefer to panettone. Stollen is also considerably easier to make at home:Dan Lepard has a good quick recipeinvolving sour cherries and quark, though, if you’re not in a hurry (and this is not a time of year for hurrying), you might preferFalko Burkert’s more traditional take.Lastly, if anyone has advice on recreating the huge chocolaterumkugelnI saw but didn’t have time to try, please send it my way. In the meantime, Frohe Weihnachten; wishing you all a delicious and joyous December, however you’re spending it.My week in foodView image in fullscreenShare the love … digital cookbook All Our Kitchens is raising funds for Gaza charities and includes recipes such as rummaniyeh by Izzeldin Bukhari, left.Composite: All Our KitchensA time for giving| Christmas, like so many religious festivals, is a time for giving – whether or not you celebrate, you might wish to share the love where it’s really needed by investing £10 in All Our Kitchens, a new digital cookbook featuring recipes from the likes of Sami Tamimi, Noor Murad and Andi Oliver, along with other professional and home cooks from across the UK, Ireland and Palestine.

Happily, however, the latest Kitchen Projects newsletter on Substack is a deep dive intoall things almond paste-related from Camilla Wynne, including a recipe that sounds far superior to versions I’ve made, as well as many inspirational pictures of cute marzipan potatoes and devilled eggs and doughnuts.Skaus or scouse?|Hamburg is famous less for its hamburgers than the dishes that reflect and celebrate its maritime heritage. Fish sandwiches are the fast food of choice at all times of day and night, while comfort food is served in the form oflabskaus, a salt beef and potato hash turned unnervingly red with beetroot juice and served with a fried egg, pickles and the inevitable rollmop. If the name sounds familiar, it is because this sailors’ favourite is also enjoyed in stew form in Liverpool, where it’s known as lobscouse, commonly shortened to scouse.My recipedoes not, however, include herring.Saluti!|Raising a glass to chefGiancarlo Caldesi, whose contribution to Italian cuisine and culinary culture in the UK was recognised by the Italian government with the title “Ufficiale”, which is roughly equivalent to a British knighthood.
