But then as a patient, I saw the love and the magicAnne PerkinsThere is something about the care and professionalism to be seen on a ward that defies abstract analysis: a reminder of what it is to be humanMon 29 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 12.24 ESTShareIwatchedNye, the National Theatre’s hit show about Aneurin Bevan, the former Labour MP for Ebbw Vale and his fight to found a national health service, twice. Both times it left me feeling a bit queasy. Bevan is a mighty working-class hero. Probably no other minister, even in that 1945 government of heroes, would have had the vision, the muscle or the sheer energy to make a national health service happen at all in those bleak postwar years, let alone in a way that no incoming government could unpick.TheNHSsits at the heart of politics and for most of my career in journalism, and charting the crises, the numbers, the arguments, the possibilities and the costs was a staple of my work. You can write all that, you can read about all that, but it can feel very different when events dictate that you cross the line from commentator to patient; when, like me, you pitch up as someone who arrives as an emergency, with a condition that might require major surgery and at least a week of post-operative hospital care – or might just go away of its own accord.There are other places in the world, I suppose, where you crawl into the emergency department wanting to die and are met with warmth and sympathy, competent professionals in more or less functional surroundings. It’s not, or not just, the security of not having to worry about the bill, because there are other ways of funding healthcare that are free at the point of use. I won’t pretend mine is a unique experience, or that all experiences are like mine, but proximity is important: having had the time to watch a ward at work, I feel there is alchemy in play here, and after six days with nothing to do but lie relatively flat and ponder, I think I may have identified it.At its heart is the sense of a shared destination. It’s like getting on a bus, maybe not the sleekest model and definitely overloaded, but we’re all on the journey together. Everyone who’s seriously and unexpectedly ill comes here. Everyone. You don’t lie in your narrow hospital bed imagining the four-star facilities you might be enjoying if only you had more dosh, because it’s odds on that if it’s an emergency, that person too is just behind the curtain hanging limply to your right.So there’s a common purpose among us all, and we all want to get to the other end. You don’t really want to die, at least not without some pain relief first, and they don’t want you to die either and are doing their damnedest to help. Somehow you know that even as you wait, cold with shock and in miserable pain, that you are seen. And counted.But something else happens too. All the time I was there, my neighbours on the ward were two older women who weren’t entirely sure where they were and one of whom very much didn’t want to be wherever it was. They both had chronic conditions. They were incontinent. They were uncooperative. But every hour of every day there were one or two nurses or healthcare assistants or carers who made time to answer their calls, to keep them safe and clean and warm and sometimes even to get a smile out of them.If you haven’t experienced it, it is hard to explain the effect of witnessing this level not only of professionalism and patience, but of love. There are studies that show that for all the criticism and brickbats aimed at the NHS, those who use it mostare the most positive about it. When you’re there and watch, you understand.As I began to get better (cheap date, no surgery) and was able to shuffle about my dog-eared old hospital, opened by Princess Anne sometime in the 1980s – about the time the Tory chancellor Nigel Lawson first started complaining that the NHS was the national religion – the feeling of common purpose I’d been aware of even in my fog of misery became even clearer. People are kind to one another here. The Friends Shop is hung with hand-knitted matinee jackets that emanate good-heartedness, and the manager of the WH Smith offers to help, rather than gesturing dismissively to the self-service tills.Strangers reach across the spaces in between to introduce themselves to one another. It’s not intrusive, it’s not compulsory, but it is unmissable: that heightened awareness and sympathy that makes three people swivel at the sound of a dropped crutch, that generosity of spirit that leads people to spend draughty afternoons showing confused visitors to distant wards.If we’re here, we’re in the same boat. We are in some way hurt, or we are supporting someone who is hurt, or maybe we’re making good on earlier kindness. It’s not magic. Everyone is still themselves, but softer. Warmer. Maybe even happier. Where else in our angry and atomised nation does this happen?Backstage, nurses wrestle with airbeds that fuse the ward’s electrics and radiologists need to sweet talk the X-ray machine into useful function. But somehow this superficially clapped-out, awkward, unmanageable old behemoth produces human beings to work in it who are capable of a resilience and love that is contagious.Bevan was driven by his own experience of want and avoidable tragedy. There are many things wrong with his creation. But whatever happens next in this most costly of long-running dramas, let us recognise the extraordinary value of what we already have. It is beyond price.Anne Perkins is a writer and broadcaster, and a former Guardian correspondentExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionHealthLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Its first-responder service is comprised of about 150 experts worldwide. It has clients who keep it on retainer, victims referred by insurers, and “walk-ins”: people who suddenly realise their business is under attack and call the first few results on their search engines.In the case of the Scattered Spider victim, which the Guardian understands was not Marks & Spencer or the Co-op – two retailers that were attacked in 2025 – a 30-minute Teams call with a retailer became “a 24-hour call with a rotating cast of experts”, says Ted Cowell, the director of S-RM’s cyber business arm.“On average we’re getting back to clients within six minutes. Which is critical because often the first hours of a cyber incident can be the biggest chance window to determine the outcome of a case and its impact,” he says. “What can start as a network intrusion can then metastasise into a full-blown malware or ransomware scenario.”View image in fullscreenEmpty shelves at an M&S store. M&S was not the retail client that S-RM helped recover from a Scattered Spider cyber-attack.Photograph: Holly Williams/PACowell, a Cambridge-educated Russian speaker, says that getting a handle on the attack during a “reconnaissance” period can result in a radically different outcome, compared with a slow response. Criminals often need time after their first penetration of a businesses’ systems to work out what is of most value. This short spell of time can therefore allow experts to prevent the most operationally painful of attacks. “Exfiltration” – the theft of critical data – and encryption, whereby businesses can be locked out of their own systems, can be the most damaging.“Sometimes we can stop it from going boom,” Cowell says. Teams focus on “stopping the bleeding” by limiting or cutting the attacker’s access to systems. This is what S-RM’s team was able to do with the Scattered Spider victim: stopping the detonation of malware across systems.Business is good as thecybercrime industry grows, but that comes with ethical challenges. S-RM and its industry peershave faced criticismfor helping to facilitate the payment of ransoms to criminals who hijack businesses for money.“Extortion support” is an important part of S-RM’s work. This means its specialists are in the room when ransoms are negotiated, sometimes doing the negotiation itself on behalf of a client. Cowell appears keen to avoid criticisms of feeding organised crime by helping businesses to pay ransoms, or by acting for insurers that sell policies covering ransom payments.“We’re instructed by the policyholder, by the insured,” he says.“Our ambition is to guide ‘no payment’ decisions wherever and whenever possible,” he continues, adding that businesses are increasingly taking that approach and not paying ransoms.“Our role is to facilitate strategic thinking,” he says. “Give clients some structure to order their thoughts. They’ve probably not been in a situation like this before.“The businesses’ decision as to what they do is their own. We just offer the template of a crisis, how things play out based on our experience.“Why should we pay these criminals?” is a challenge Cowell says his team puts to top staff at affected businesses. “One of the things that we often educate boards on is that ransomware is an organised criminal enterprise.”These nefarious groups have, he explains, “brands to uphold”. Established ransomware groups, typically speaking, will honour a settlement. S-RM also has an increasingly detailed picture of how these groups have behaved in previous negotiations.The more established the group, the more likely they are to honour whatever settlement is agreed either by deleting stolen data or providing keys to decrypt critical files. S-RM offers a rundown of who’s who in terms of reliability, negotiating patterns, behaviours, even extending to sanctions concerns.The latter rarely applies, however. Trying to impose sanctions on state-linked groups is a game of “whack-a-mole”, Cowell says. If so-called “threat actors” do appear on sanctions lists they tend to disband and reform in a new guise. The risk of putting money, albeit indirectly, into state-enemy hands is therefore another consideration for firms facing a cyber-attack.View image in fullscreenProduction resumes at Jaguar Land Rover. Investigations into the cyber-attack on the carmaker identified Russia as a potential suspect.Photograph: JLRStill, businesses do sometimes decide to pay up. It can be rational for their company’s circumstances, and ultimately “it’s always their decision”, Cowell says.As the corporate moral code of paying ransoms matures, and decisions not to fund organised crime become more common, restoration and recovery services have become a bigger part of the cybersecurity response market. Increasingly it is a priority to just get systems back up and running as soon as possible with the forensic analysis of how someone got into a system becoming secondary.In recent years, the UK government’s cyber-intelligence role has also shifted significantly. The National Cyber Security Centre “over the last four or five years has hugely transformed”, Cowell says. The NCSC has caught up with its Nordic equivalents and now proactively reaches out to victims, telling them they may be targeted based on intelligence.“It was more of an information taker,” asking the likes of S-RM for information, which they would willingly provide with client consent, Cowell says.“[Now] they are playing a more robust role, getting on the front foot and getting people together tofacilitate information sharing. We saw the impact of that with the Scattered Spider attacks.,” he adds.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Grace Dent is a joy, while Torode bows out in a … very maverick way indeedSarah DempsterMon 29 Dec 2025 16.00 ESTShareSo. Farewell then, John Torode. You were the co-presenter ofMasterChefand Celebrity MasterChef. Until you weren’t. But first, and finally, there is this: the second of two festive specials in which we watch the Australian peering at potatoes while pretending we don’t know the BBC chose not to renew his contract in July after an allegation against him using “an extremely offensive racist term” was upheld. (Torode denies the allegations and claims to have “no recollection” of the incident).So, let’s scurry past the indignities (the two unaired Christmas specials from 2024; the summer of “MASTERCHEF CHAOS” headlines; the aired-but-with-two-contestants-edited-out-at-their-request series of MasterChef; Gregg Wallace) and remember him this way: staring blankly in linen as a panicking former credit controller from Hackney drops half a lobster on the studio floor.“Two courses. Two-and-a-half hours. Ladies and gentlemen,” Torode announces, his arms wide. “Let’s cook.”And we’re off. MasterChef Festive Extravaganza: Champion of Champions finds four previous MasterChef winners competing to secure the “ultimate” titular accolade and a trophy in the form of a golden frying pan nailed to a plinth (good luck trying to fit it in the dishwasher after you’ve burned your sausage frittata, Champion of Champions).Brin is delightful company, but we must draw a firm veil over his habit of speaking about Brin in the third personThey are Brin Pirathapan (who originally triumphed in 2024), Thomas Frake (2020), Natalie Coleman (2013) and Chariya Khattiyot (2023). Remember them? Probably not. Thanks to the incessant churn of the industrial TV contestant complex, their names, “journeys” and duck parfaits are – to this viewer at least – long lost to the sands of time. Torode and co-host Grace Dent might as well be asking Amenhotep III to knock together a welsh rarebit. Still, they’re a cheery bunch, the special’s festive remit favouring the can-do chuckler type over the showboating berk. Their first task? To create a dish “fit for royalty!” Chariya sets to work on a “queen bee golden hive dessert” comprising orange liqueur gel, dark tempered chocolate, honey bee-shaped milk chocolate tuile and a building site of Crunchie-adjacent honeycomb rubble.“Regal,” says guest judge Tom Parker Bowles, approvingly. “Hee-hee,” replies Chariya, who is dressed, for reasons that are never entirely made clear, as Widow Twankey.Lobster-dropping Natalie, meanwhile, rustles up a lamb cannon with “artichoke four ways”, anchovy and garlic cream, and a port and redcurrant sauce. “Don’t wanna make myself look like a muppet,” she honks, putting the finishing touches to a meatball that looks like a small, bald man in a hairnet. A Greggling, if you will.Former vet Brin presents us with a spectacular, Yellow Submarine-themed slab of halibut, his Lord Kitchener moustache flapping victoriously over the accompanying champagne and saffron beurre blanc. Brin is delightful company, but we must draw a firm veil over his habit of speaking about Brin in the third person. (“We’re back to the bold, slap-you-round-the-face flavours of Brin!” he says, and oh, the moustache wilts like spinach).I won’t make a single one of these TV Christmas recipes; I’m just here to gawp | Grace DentRead moreWhile the chefs set about their stoves, we find our thoughts wandering. First to Dent, whose sparky interactions with the contestants are everything that Torode’s (flat, detached) and Wallace’s (a dog barking at a trifle through a fence) are/were not. She’s a joy; her unaffected enthusiasm providing a seamless, sequined bridge between Old MasterChef (bloated, Gregg-y) and New MasterChef (funny, involved, unlikely to be sacked following multiple allegations of aggravated bellendry).Torode, meanwhile, seems … different. Less tense. Looser around the chops. Where once his tight-jawed pronouncements were limited to brief observations on gravy, they are now unpredictable, freewheeling things full of unexpectedly loud bursts of emotion. And volume. And maverick experiments. In punctuation.It’s all a bit “modern poetry”. A bit … jazz.“She. Is anexpertwith fish,” he says of Natalie. “Because. Her grandfather. Loved. Fish. Aaaaaaand she used tocook it. For him.”Frankly, the final dishes caaaaaan’t come quickly enough. Not least when they are as gasp-inducing as Thomas’s densely treacle-marinated roast venison, Chariya’s beef tenderloin with “railway fried rice” or Natalie’s twinkly pink disco of a rhubarb crumble, which succeeds in reducing the judges’ knees to custard.“That was probablythebest food. I have eaten in. Thehistoryof MasterChef,” Torode soliloquies, directing his jazz-vowels at someone in the wings (Gregg?) before sitting back and patting his belly like a sated Honey Monster. And with that, the final curtain swooshes down.So long, mate. Thanks. For all the fish.MasterChef Festive Extravaganza: Champion of Champions aired on BBC One is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsMasterChefTV reviewFood TVTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

In this case, it was a proper rustic European clock – none of your chrome or plastic nonsense – wooden and ancient, with little figurines which bustled around inside it, on the hour, every hour.I was 20, on a European road trip, chugging around in an older man’s van in 2014, perpetually hungover.The older man was a friend who was actually only 40 or so at the time, which I certainly wouldn’t consider old now. He had two treasured attributes, extremely rare in London to this day – he coulddriveand heowned a vehicle.It was a ritual for him and his boyfriend to explore Europe each summer, and that year they invited me along.We wended from city to city, stopping in Krakow, Gdansk and Vienna. In Krakow I got lost and had to ask one of the ladies with the pink umbrellas (if you know, you know) to walk me back to my hotel, where I politely thanked her and informed her I was a homosexual. She was unimpressed.We allegedly had one night in Berlin – but I can’t remember it, so it doesn’t count – before heading to Cologne.In a cavernous gay club, which is probably now a branch of Ikea, dancing to a track that was probably by Cascada, I saw him. A pale punk with a bright green mohawk, dancing like a windsock, wearing a Donnie Darko T-shirt and a scowl. I chatted to him and he offered me some of his horrible energy drink and what may have been a mint.I wasn’t remotely attracted to him, but I did love Nicole Richie at the time, and her words suddenly floated into my head. She had said she liked men who were “really skinny and pale and look like they’re dying”, and I decided to emulate her. We danced for a few sweaty hours, then I blinked and we were in a taxi, on a pitch black motorway, headlights illuminating horror movie flashes of warning signs and conifers.Because of his mohawk and his general vibe, I’d assumed his place would be in the heart of the city, a short vroom back from the club … perhaps a chic loft apartment with a big sliding metal front door,Franka Potentequietly lighting a spliff on an ergonomic sofa while waving us towards a bedroom doorway framed by resilient house plants and bare brick.This was not the case. His place was a ramshackle chalet about 30 miles out of the city, and as we left the cab I saw the ghostly shapes of llamas drifting around behind a collapsing wooden fence, chickens cooing in their sleep nearby. What had I done? Was this how I died?When we got in, he flipped on a light so bright it should have been illegal, to reveal a sofa, covered in some sort of mesh fabric, which had burst and begun to disintegrate. We proceeded to have really bad sex on it. Halfway through, he jumped up and ran to the kitchen, returning with one of those cans of budget olive oil cooking spray. What happened next is best left to the imagination.With the one remaining bar on my iPhone 4, I called my friends the next day and they arrived early to pick me up. They slid open the van door to see me pulling a heavy oak door shut, bleary-eyed, hungover and half dressed, a field of llamas braying behind me.We all collapsed with laughter. It made me realise thatthemost important thing in life is to have friends who not only won’t judge you for waking up on a llama farm in rural Germany – they’ll come and pick you up in a van withHeidi Montag’s Superficialon full blast.Explore more on these topicsGermany holidaysMy big night outClubbingGermanyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He wanted the subject present, even when he was painting floorboards and background.

This restless, deep-seeing artist followed his elders, the impressionists, to the shores, ports and seaside towns of northern France but his pointillist fragmented views – a rock towering over the sea; an eerily still and unpopulated harbour; a long lonely channel connecting Gravelines, near Dunkirk, with the sea – are brilliant and achingly desolate visions of modernism.JJCourtauld Gallery, London,13 February to 17 MayBeatriz GonzálezDepicting tabloid crimes of passion and political murders, Latin American feminism and social commentary, the Colombian painter and sculptor Beatriz González developed duringLa Violencia, the decades-long civil war that gripped the country.

Whistler was au fait with the French avant garde: in an 1860s group portrait of them he looks like a wild west gunslinger, putting Manet and Baudelaire in the shade. He then brought their modernist ideas to London, painting a sleazy gathering at Wapping and dreamy impressions of the Thames, all while taking the critic John Ruskin to court. The original modern art star.JJTate Britain, London,21 May to 27 SeptemberAnish KapoorYou can’t go wrong with Kapoor – he turns art galleries into adult playgrounds full of riotous visual spectacle and sublime fun. His recent work has explored new, provocative ground with sculptures and paintings that plunge into a red, visceral imagery of human flesh. At the same time, he has been exploring the nature of the ultimate black in pieces that are as much physics as art. This readiness to follow new, unexpected ideas on top of an already stunning career makes him a dangerous and exciting artist who is sure to keep you on your toes.JJHayward Gallery, London,16 June to 18 OctoberFrida Kahlo: The Making of an IconThe paintings, diaries and courageous life of this surrealist artist are endlessly compelling and a guaranteed hit for Tate. And why not? I think she is underrated. Our tendency to see her as a kind of performance artist and pop star belittles how good her paintings and drawings really are: so truthful, so frank, yet infused with mythology, religion and dreams. She invented this confessional approach decades before anyone else thought of it. Embrace this encounter with one of the truly great artists of the 20th century.JJTate Modern, London,25 June to 3 January 2027Ana MendietaWorking in sculpture, performance, film and photography, the Cuban-born artist Ana Mendieta put her body, its imprint and silhouette, at the core of her art. Displacement and absence were a recurrent theme. Mendieta left her trace everywhere, using water, flowers and fire, in film and photography, performance and sculpture, in all too short a career. In a career overshadowed by the circumstances of her death, her art remains vital and alive.ASTate Modern, London, 9 Julyto 10 January 2027Richard Dadd: Beyond BedlamBefore surrealism there was Richard Dadd. Monstrous fairies do unspeakable things in the overgrown grass of an out-of-scale garden, doctors and orderlies pose for staring portraits in lurid nature – Dadd’s world is a psychedelic hallucination, or bad-trip nightmare. His best known paintings were done in the asylum after he murdered his father while in the grip of psychosis. He was treated kindly and his art flourished, free from Victorian respectability. Venture down the rabbit hole.JJRoyal Academy, London, 25 July to 25 OctoberBayeux TapestryView image in fullscreenContemporary meaning in age-old embroidery … the Bayeux Tapestry.Photograph: Bayeux MuseumThe art event of the year, by some distance, has to be this once-in-a-lifetime triumph of cultural generosity by France. The greatest and most popular early medieval artwork comes to the country whose invasion by the Normans in 1066 it depicts in epic human detail. You can, and people will, find all manner of contemporary meanings in this vast embroidery, from a condemnation of war to nationalistic nonsense to proof that Britons are Europeans … but it is almost 1,000 years old and portrays another world, other ways of being. It will move and astonish you.JJBritish Museum, London, opens autumnMike NelsonIn 2004, Mike Nelsonburied a shack in a sand dune, in the upstairs gallery at Modern Art Oxford. Nelson’s work, with its mix of fact and fiction, history and fabulation, is always as engrossing as it is disturbing. For the 60th anniversary of the gallery, Nelson returns to Oxford with a new work, currently under wraps.ASModern Art, Oxford, opens autumnBeverly Buchanan: WeatheringRemnants and ruins, sculptural versions of sharecroppers’ shacks and other fragments of lives lived and hardships endured, are key elements for Buchanan (1940-2015). In her evocations of the complex conditions of rural African American life, Buchanan’s art was often sited outdoors, where tides and weather would eventually sweep them away. What remains is a key question, both as metaphor and memory. Belatedly, Buchanan’s time has come, in this first European travelling retrospective.ASSpike Island, Bristol, 26 Septemberto 10 January 2027LS LowryIndustrial northern scenes, sometimes teeming and sometimes empty, melancholic seascapes and weirdly vacant landscapes: you think you know Lowry’s art – and perhaps dismiss him – but there’s so much more to him than the matchstick-men cliches. Fifty years after his death, MK gallery mounts this first major retrospective in more than a decade.ASMK Gallery, Milton Keynes,24 October to 28 February 2027Van Eyck: The PortraitsThe early 15th-century magic of Jan van Eyck will captivate you in this show of his mesmerising portraits. Van Eyck used oil paint to mirror reality. He also pioneered perspective. These huge artistic innovations make him the first true Renaissance artist. Yet he worked in the medieval world of the Burgundian court and the merchant city Bruges. His masterpiece, the Arnolfini Portrait, takes you into a merchant’s house to ponder an enigmatic relationship between a woman and man: it will be presented here alongside other uncannily true-seeming images of grave, pale faces looking back at you like ghosts with secrets.JJNational Gallery, London, 21 November to 11 April 2027ArchitectureView image in fullscreenShimmering … the Santa Giulia Arena, designed by David Chipperfield for the Milano-Cortina Olympic and Paralympic Games.Illustration: Onirism Studio / David Chipperfield ArchitectsSanta Giulia Arena, Milan: David ChipperfieldIt’s snowtime as the Winter Olympics glide off in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo, with David Chipperfield’s 16,000 capacity Santa Giulia ice hockey stadium at the heart of the slippery action.

Dating from 1928, it’s a sybaritic example of Nordic classicism, designed by Väinö Vähäkallio, one of Finland’s most versatile early 20th-century architects. As swimsuits are optional, men and women partake of separate bathing sessions, while cabins around the pool’s upper level encourage patrons to relax with a glass of gin and lingonberries.CSOpens 2 FebruaryMaggie’s: Architecture that CaresView image in fullscreenMaggie’s Edinburgh, by Richard Murphy with garden design by Emma Keswick.Photograph: Eoin CareyOver three decades, a growing network of Maggie’s cancer care centres across the UK has created memorable and much-needed spaces for those dealing with the impact of cancer, away from a clinical hospital environment. Shaped by founder Maggie Keswick Jencks’ ambition to help people “not lose the joy of living in the fear of dying”, this exhibition explores Maggie’s pioneering approach to design, bringing together the voices of centre visitors, staff and architects.CSV&A Dundee, 6 March to 1 NovemberArchitecture Against Architecture by Reinier de GraafArchitecture, as we know it, may be coming to an end, contends Dutch architectural theorist Reinier de Graaf, and architects have only themselves to blame. The profession is out of touch, fixated by glitzy “starchitects”, and disdains to respond to wider social, political and economic change. In a provocative 14-point manifesto, De Graaf calls for unionisation, a mandatory retirement age, explains why we should stop building, and considers whether an architect should refuse a project on moral grounds.CSVerso Books, 24 MarchV&A East Museum, London: O’Donnell + TuomeyThe sculptural tailoring of Spanish couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga provides a jumping-off point for the V&A’s major new outpost in Stratford, east London. Designed by the Irish architects O’Donnell + Tuomey, the building appears as a crisply angular “folded dress”, giving the museum a distinctive form and striking identity. Helmed byGus Casely-Hayford, it will radically reinterpret the V&A’s collections through a contemporary lens, exploring aspects of representation, identity, wellbeing, craft practice and social justice.CSOpens 18 AprilDavid Geffen Galleries, Los Angeles County Museum of Art: Peter ZumthorView image in fullscreenLos Angeles County Museum of Art (Lacma) by Peter Zumthor.Photograph: Iwan BaanThe long-awaited public opening of the David Geffen Galleries sees Lacma’s permanent collection arrayed within a concrete and glass amoeba conceived by Peter Zumthor, who brings his USP of Swiss asceticism to LA’s contemporary art world. Elevated above a plaza, the exhibition level is a single flowing space with no prescribed visitor route, which the museum sees as a means of “eliminating traditional cultural hierarchies”, placing “all works of art on the same plane”. Literally.CSOpens AprilSkate Space 50Emerging out of a labyrinth of concrete ledges, pillars and stairs below Southbank’s Queen Elizabeth Hall, the Undercroft Skate Space lays claim to being the world’s oldest continually used skateboarding locale. First informally adopted by London’s skateboarders in the 1970s, it is now a permanent fixture on the skate circuit. As part of the Southbank Centre’s 75th anniversary, an exhibition will explore 50 years of the Undercroft Skate Space through photography, moving image and sound.CSSouthbank Centre, London, 7 May to 21 JuneBasílica de la Sagrada Família, Barcelona: Antoni GaudíA century after its architect was knocked down and killed by a tram, the fever dream of Barcelona’s Sagrada Família, a molten, kaleidoscopic basilica for the ages, reaches a climax of sorts. Construction will finish on the final, focal, Jesus Christ spire soaring 172 metres above the city, in time for the 100th anniversary of Antoni Gaudí’s death on 10 June. Originally, his elaborate stone forms were laboriously carved by hand, but digital technology now makes his febrile visions a reality.CSOpens 10 JuneGoogle headquarters, London: Bjarke Ingels Group and Heatherwick StudioGoogle’s UK headquarters is a 330-metre-long landscraper, as long as the Shard is high, butted up against King’s Cross station. “Continuously cascading work environments will connect Googlers across multiple floors,” says Danish architect Bjarke Ingels somewhat gnomically, but work drudgery will be leavened by an expansive roof garden, swimming pool, gym and cafe. Critics have called it the “Zombie Garden Bridge”, after co-designer Thomas Heatherwick’s now aborted proposal to connect the Thames with a landscaped crossing.CSOpens AugustKanal, Brussels: noAarchitecten, EM2N and Sergison Bates ArchitectsHoused in a remodelled and expanded former Citroën garage and showroom, Kanal is a bold new museum of contemporary art for Brussels. The former showroom is transformed into a “display cabinet” for installations, performances and concerts, while an internal street connects a trio of boxes containing exhibition spaces and a 400-seat auditorium.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.After years of living in flat-shares, I’ve picked up a few tricks which, in my experience, make the home setup – whatever form that takes – smoother. From fridge organisers to shoe storage that stops your hallway from feeling like an obstacle course, here are 21 ways to cut down on communal living confusion, dread and passive-aggressive Post-it notes.Home organisation ideasShared calendarNothing breeds resentment faster than mixed-up plans and miscommunication. A wall calendar or shared planner can save a lot of crossed wires. When everyone can see birthdays, bin days and friends’ visits in one place, there’s less chance of clashing commitments. In one of my old flat-shares, the calendar prevented awkward “oh, I didn’t know your parents were visiting” moments. Families can use it to keep on top of school trips, after-school activities and appointments; housemates for rent days and rotas.View image in fullscreenTypographic A3 calendar£22 at PapierView image in fullscreenMonthly undated A3 wall planner£19.50 at Good TuesdayView image in fullscreen2026 wall planner£15 at PapersmithsColour-coded towelsIn the house I grew up in, towel ownership was a mystery until my mum introduced a simple-but-effective fix: a colour-coded system. Beige was mine, orange was my brother’s, and arguments about soggy towels left on the floor disappeared overnight. It’s one of those ideas that’s stuck – and works just as well in shared flats.View image in fullscreenEgyptian cotton bath towel£14 at NextView image in fullscreenCotton terry bath sheet£14.99 at H&MView image in fullscreenLuxury Egyptian cotton bath towel£14 at M&SBathroom caddiesIf your bathroom shelves are overflowing with shampoos, body washes and almost identical-looking toothbrushes, a grab-and-go caddy is a gamechanger. Everyone gets their own basket for toiletries, which can help keep the shared space clear of clutter (and arguments over who used their conditioner). If there’s no space to keep them in the bathroom, you can just carry your basket in and out. Plastic is best, just in case it gets wet. For a very streamlined system, you could even match the basket to your designated shade of towel.View image in fullscreenUpprämen storage basket£15 at IkeaView image in fullscreenStorage caddy£5.12 at Søstrene GreneView image in fullscreenHay stackable crate£6 at Selfridges£9.95 at AmazonClutter collector by the doorFew things cause more morning chaos than a missing item. A bowl or tray by the door can solve this, giving you a “leaving the house” station to drop essentials such as loose change and headphones the moment you get home and grab them again on the way out. It also stops clutter spreading across worktops and side tables.View image in fullscreenGlassscallop tray£26.50 at John LewisView image in fullscreenRound jute storage basket£4 at DunelmEarplugs and noise-cancelling headphonesLiving with others can be noisy, whether it’s someone on a work call or the rumble of a 7amsmoothie-maker.

A small, basic tool kit saves rummaging through drawers for a single screwdriver or buying bits for each project. Look for one with the essentials: hammer, screwdrivers, tape measure and pliers.

Go for a hardy variety, such as a snake plant or pothos, that doesn’t mind the occasional forgotten watering. It adds a bit of life to the room, even if it’s mostly just surviving on neglect.

But they have to disarm within a fairly short period of time.”He described the question of Israel withdrawing its forces as “a separate subject”, adding only: “We’ll talk about that.”Into the void: how Trump killed international lawRead moreLast week the US news outlet Axios reported that theTrump administrationwanted to announce the Palestinian technocratic government for Gaza and the ISF as soon as possible and that senior Trump officials were growing exasperated “as Netanyahu has taken steps to undermine the fragile ceasefire and stall the peace process”.But Trump himself appeared to show no such qualms after Monday’s meeting. He said he was “not concerned about anything that Israel is doing” and “Israel has lived up to the plan, 100%”.He repeatedly pointed the finger at Hamas, saying “it’ll be horrible for them” if they failed to disarm. “It’s going to be really, really bad for them, and I don’t want that to happen. But they made an agreement that they were going to disarm. And you couldn’t blame Israel,” he said.Hamas retains large quantities of small arms but only a fraction of the heavy weapons that enabled its surprise attack into southern Israel in 2023, in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 250 abducted.More than 70,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed in the ensuing Israeli offensive and vast swathes of Gaza reduced to ruins. About 400 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli firesince the October ceasefire.In recent weeks, Hamas has successfully established its authority over the parts of Gaza it controls with a series of executions,raidsand beatings targeting rival power brokers, collaborators with Israel and criminal gangs. Most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is said to now live in the Hamas-controlled zone.The Islamist militant organisation has proposed some solutions to allow some of its weapons to be put into storage but has refused to accept full disarmament.Hamas’s armed wing reiterated on Monday that it would not surrender its weapons.“Our people are defending themselves and will not give up their weapons as long as the occupation remains,” the new spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, who has adopted the name of his late predecessor Abu Obeida, said in a video statement.Trump claimed that other countries that supported the peace deal would “go in and wipe out Hamas” if it fails to hold up its end of the bargain.View image in fullscreenPeople attend a rally earlier this month calling for the return of the remains of Ran Gvili in Tel Aviv, Israel.Photograph: Maya Levin/APTrump and Netanyahu earlier held a lunch meeting inside Mar-a-Lago along with their delegations. Netanyahu was expected to tell Trump that Hamas must return the remains of the last Israeli hostage left in Gaza before the next stages of the stalled ceasefire can be implemented, Israeli officials and analysts said.Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Trump falsely said “just about” every hostage was released because of him and his team, whereas “none” were released during the Joe Biden administration. In fact, Hamas released a total of 138 hostages as a result of deals that Biden’s administration helped broker, according to the Snopes factchecking site.The family of the last person whose remains have not been returned, Ran Gvili, has joined the Israeli prime minister’s visiting entourage and will meet officials in Washington later this week.Peace, power and profit – the logic behind Donald Trump’s dealmaking diplomacyRead moreAn Israeli official in Netanyahu’s circle told Reuters that the prime minister would demand that Hamas return the remains of all hostages in Gaza, as required under the ceasefire deal, before moving to the next stages of Trump’s plan.A second phase of the peace plan calls for an interim authority made up of non-aligned Palestinian technocrats to govern the Palestinian territory, and an international stabilisation force (ISF) of thousands of troops to be deployed. Israel has significant concerns about both.Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer, was badly wounded and then abducted during the October 2023 Hamas raid into Israel that triggered the conflict. It is unclear if he died of his wounds during the raid or in Gaza.Hundreds gathered on Saturday nightin Tel Aviv to demand that Israel makes no concession to advance the ceasefire deal until his remains are returned.Lianne Pollak-David, a former Israeli military intelligence officer and peace negotiator in the prime minister’s office, said the failure to return the remains of Gvili was a serious issue. “Netanyahu and the Israelis as a people are simply not going to accept this,” she said.Hamas has freed 20 living hostages and returned the bodies of 27 dead hostages since October and some observers see the insistence on Gvili’s remains being returned as a delaying tactic to allow Israel’s military forces to remain in the 53% of Gaza they currently control.Daniel Levy, a UK-based analyst and former Israeli peace negotiator, said Netanyahu had no intention of withdrawing further from Gaza or allowing any international force that would deter Israeli military action.“He feels he has a number of cards to play yet and the remains of Gvili is the easiest one to play now but there are others,” Levy said.For Netanyahu, who faces an election within 10 months, the prospect of Iran repairing the damage inflicted on its nuclear programme in its short war with Israel and the US this summer and building up its ballistic missile capabilities is another priority.Trump had previously insisted that Iran’s nuclear capabilities were “completely and fully obliterated”. But on Monday he said: “I hope they’re not trying to build up again because, if they are, we’re going to have no choice but very quickly to eradicate that buildup.”The president added: “Iran may be behaving badly. It hasn’t been confirmed. But if it’s confirmed, look, they know the consequences will be very powerful, maybe more powerful than the last time.” Pressed for evidence, he said: “This is just what we hear, but usually where there’s smoke, there’s fire.”‘Yellow line’ that divides Gaza under Trump plan is ‘new border’ for Israel, says military chiefRead moreThe Israeli prime minister may be hoping for a political boost from his latest meeting with Trump, whom he again praised as Israel’s greatest friend. Netanyahu said: “We decided to break a convention – or create a new one – and that is to award the Israel prize, which in almost our 80 years we’ve never awarded it to a non-Israeli, and we’re going to award it this year to President Trump…for his tremendous contributions to Israel and the Jewish people.”It was a second consolation prize for Trump, whomissed outon this year’s Nobel peace prize but received aFifa peace prize– dismissed by critics as a cynical ploy by world football’s governing body to curry favour.As if returning the compliment, Trump claimed he had spoken to the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, who told him that a pardon for Netanyahu in his long-running corruption trial was “on its way”. Trump said: “He’s a wartime prime minister who’s a hero. How do you not give a pardon?”Asked about Trump’s remarks, Herzog’s office said the Israeli president had not had any conversations with Trump since a pardon request was submitted several weeks ago, Reuters reported.Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpIsraelHamasGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He said Russia was “at it again” and using “dangerous statements” to undermine “diplomatic efforts” with the US to end the conflict.He added: “This alleged ‘residence strike’ story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks againstUkraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war.”Ukraine’s president warned that a strike on a main government complex in its capital was likely, similar to Russia’s bombing in September of the cabinet ministers’ building in central Kyiv.Earlier, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov,claimedUkraine had tried to hit Putin’s residence in the Novgorod region, south of St Petersburg. As a result Moscow’s negotiating position would be reviewed, he said.0:29Russia strikes Kyiv before Zelenskyy's meeting with Trump – videoLavrov said Russian air defences had shot down 91 incoming drones. “Such reckless actions will not go unanswered,” he added, denouncing what he called “state terrorism”. Targets for retaliatory strikes against Ukraine had already been selected, he said.The Kremlin’s latest bellicose threat appeared to be part of a KGB-style informational campaign directed at Russians and an impressionable White House. The Russian presidential adviser Yuri Ushakov claimed Putin briefed Trump about the alleged attack when they spoke on Monday.Trump was “shocked” at the news, Ushakov claimed, with Russian officials alleging that Britain was also involved in what he described as “provocations”.Ushakov’s characterisation of Trump rang true when, speaking at Mar-a-Lago on Monday afternoon, the US president told reporters the news made him “very angry”. “I don’t like it. It’s not good,” Trump said when asked if he was worried it could affect his efforts to broker peace.“I learned about it from President Putin today,” he said, adding: “It’s a delicate period of time. This is not the right time. It’s one thing to be offensive, because they’re offensive. It’s another thing to attack his house. It’s not the right time to do any of that.”When asked if there was any evidence of such an attack, Trump said: “We’ll find out.”Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, described the conversation between him and Putin as “positive”. It followed a lengthy call between the two leaders on Saturday.Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Moscow was using the old tactic of accusing the other side of“what you are doing or planning yourself”. He pointed out that Kyiv only hits “legitimate military targets” on enemy territory and was defending itself from Russian aggression.Earlier Zelenskyy said the US had offered “strong” security guarantees to Ukraine for 15 years, but acknowledged that the future of the country’s eastern Donbas region was unresolved after talks with Trump at the US president’s Mar-a-Lago residence.Speaking on his way back toEurope, Zelenskyy said the US Congress and Ukraine’s parliament would jointly vote on American pledges. These were a key part of a 20-point peace plan discussed with the US president, he said.The guarantees are seen by Kyiv as crucial to deter further Russian aggression in the event of a peace deal. Zelenskyy admitted that previous promises – including the US and UK-backed 1994Budapest memorandumguaranteeing Ukraine’s borders – “did not work”.The details of the latest US commitments remain unclear. Trump has ruled out deploying peacekeeping troops. Zelenskyy said the presence of international monitors in a postwar Ukraine was the best form of security and would provide reassurance to the country’s citizens.Ukraine’s president added: “We would really like the guarantees to be longer. I told him [Trump] that we would like to consider guarantees for 30, 40, or even 50 years, and that would be a historic decision by President Trump. The president said he would think about it.”Is claim Ukraine deal is ‘95% done’ just another empty assertion from Trump?Read moreAt a joint press conference on Sunday evening Trump claimed a deal to end the warwas “closer than ever”. In reality, the two sides remain far apart, with the Kremlin insisting on Monday that Ukraine had to withdraw its troops from a “fortress belt” of cities in Donetsk oblast.Vladimir Putin’s press spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said if Kyiv did not strike a deal it would lose more territory. He refused to comment on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, occupied by Moscow since its 2022 full-scale invasion and another sticking point in the negotiations.Zelenskyy ruled out giving land to Russia. “It’s no secret Russia wants this. In their fantasies, they would like us not to exist on the territory of our own country at all,” he said. He instead proposed a demilitarised and free economic zone along the existing frontline, with both sides pulling back their troops.The plan could be put to the Ukrainian people in a referendum, which would take place if Russia agreed to a ceasefire lasting for at least 60 days. Zelenskyy described a possible national vote as a “powerful tool” that would be an “expression of the Ukrainian people’s will”.Trump spoke to European leaders on Sunday by video call from Mar-a-Lago. Zelenskyy said he expected to hold talks with them in Europe in the coming days, with a joint follow-up meeting with Trump likely to take place in January, probably at the White House.0:29'Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed': watch Zelenskyy react to Trump's claimTalks on Sunday between the US and Ukrainian delegations were “great” and “substantive”, Zelenskyy said.Ukrainian commenters expressed relief on Monday that there was not a repeat at the Mar-a-Lago meeting of the humiliating scenes in February when Trump threw Zelenskyy out of the Oval Office.But they were scathing about some of Trump’s remarks, including his dubious claim that “Russia wants to see a very successful Ukraine”. They noted that the US president refused to condemn the Kremlin’s large-scale air attack on Kyiv over the weekend, involving more than 500 drones, saying: “Ukraine has made very strong attacks as well.”‪Maria Popova‬, an associate professor of political science at McGill University in Canada,said on Blueskythat Trump “sounded again like a Putin sock puppet” in his Mar-a-Lago press conference. She pointed out Trump had held a long phone call with Putin just ahead of his meeting with Zelenskyy, adding that the US president’s mind was “freshly full of Russian propaganda”.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaEuropeDonald TrumpUS foreign policyVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

More than a third (37%) ofReform UKvoters said they would be prouder of Britain if there were fewer people from minority ethnic backgrounds in a decade’s time, and 10% said it was important to have white skin to be a good British citizen.The results are evidence that hard-right narratives are having some success in remoulding the public’s conception of national identity; overall, though, popular opinion still supports a progressive vision of Britishness based on shared values, not ethnicity or ancestry.Parth Patel, an associate director at IPPR, said: “Politicians and activists on the right are trying to change how we think about ourselves and one another. They believe belonging to this nation is defined by ancient rights and historical claims, and want the rest of us to believe that too. Worryingly, they are starting to change the hearts and minds of some people in Britain.“Having become used to opponents who challenge them mainly on grounds of economic equality, progressives now find themselves locked in conflict with those who reject far more basic tenets of human equality. We should be meeting this contest with confidence and conviction.”According to the IPPR analysis, a majority of supporters of all big parties besides Reform, including the Conservatives, thought the nation was a civic community defined by shared values, and not an ethnic community defined by shared ancestry.When asked what made a good British citizen, the most popular answers were obeying the law, which was chosen by 64% of those polled, raising children to be kind (62%) and working hard (48%). Just 8% said it involved sticking up for British-born people above other groups, and 3% said it involved having white skin.When asked what would make them proud of the country in a decade’s time, people prioritised good public services and quality of life: 69% said a well-functioning NHS, 53% cited affordability and 36% housing. Significantly fewer prioritised reductions in immigration (28%) or ethnic diversity (13%).Who supports Reform and why? The charts that show who favours Farage’s partyRead moreThe IPPR called on Keir Starmer to build on the contents of his speech at the Labour party conference, where he countered ethno-nationalist views, and develop a programme of national renewal founded on a clear vision of what kind of country Britain should be and what binds it together.In his speech, the prime minister said he was engaged in a “fight for the soul of our country” with the hard right. “If you say or imply that people cannot be English or British because of the colour of their skin, that mixed-heritage families owe you an explanation, that people who have lived here for generations … should now be deported, then mark my words, we will fight you with everything we have because you are an enemy of national renewal,” he said.Reform has faced criticism for its threat to deport hundreds of thousands of people who are legally resident in Britain by scrapping the main route to settlement. Katie Lam, a Tory shadow minister, was also criticised for endorsing mass deportations to make Britain “culturally coherent”, in remarks that werelater dismissed by the party’s leader, Kemi Badenoch.In recent months, senior politicians have warned of a surge in ethno-nationalist ideas, many of them propagated online. The Guardianreported recentlythat in most weeks, far-right political content appeared in the top-five stories circulating on social media, according to weekly summaries commissioned by ministers.Afar-right march organised by Tommy Robinsonin Westminster in September attracted between 110,000 and 150,000 people.The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, who is a practising Muslim and was born in Britain to Pakistani parents, said this month that she was “very proud to be a citizen of a country that is as diverse as we are”.Mahmood,responding to the US government’s national security strategy, which criticised European countries’ migration policies and called for the restoration of “western identity”, said Britain was “a multifaith, multi-ethnic country” that “allows people to have the calling of their own conscience to live their own life free, but also has common rules that we all live by so that we live in peace together”.Badenoch, who was born in Britain to Nigerian parents, said in an interview this summer that she had faced a wave of online “ethno-nationalism” including “lots of stuff about my race and my ethnicity”.“They will try and use the tropes about black people – that they’re lazy, they’re corrupt or they’re all DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] hires – and it’s something which I find extraordinary because I take everyone at face value,” she said.Nick Garland, an associate fellow at IPPR and a former political speechwriter for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, stressed that “a vast majority of the public still believes in a nation built on shared values and common interests, not birthplace or background”.“The urgent task for the government – and for progressives more broadly – is to give voice to this belief by setting out a compelling alternative vision of the nation: a story of who we are that looks forward, not back. The fight over what it means to be British must be met by rejecting division and reclaiming a shared, inclusive national project.”Explore more on these topicsBritish identity and societyRaceCommunitiesThinktanksReform UKFar rightImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

Speaking to the Guardian before the honour was announced, Brown called on King Charles to apologise for what had been done to the post office operators in the name of the crown. She said: “An apology from the king would really vindicate what we have gone through.”She said much post office work was done under the name of the crown and that she and others were wrongly convicted by the crown.Mervyn Kersh, 101, a D-day veteran, said it was a “wonderful thing” to be awarded a British Empire Medal (BEM) for services to Holocaust remembrance and education.The oldest on the list was 102-year-old John Hearn, who receives a BEM for services to judo and to the community in north-east England.The youngest recipient this year was 20-year-old Toby Roberts, an Olympic gold medal-winning sports climber, who becomes an MBE.This year’s list included two sets of twins.

But then Trump took the stage to say that unlike Kirk – “a missionary with a noble spirit” who did not “hate” his opponents, Trump said he disagreed.‘We have become so divided’: Georgia district prepares for life after Marjorie Taylor GreeneRead more“I hate my opponent, and I don’t want the best for them,” Trump said.Greene said: “That was absolutely the worst statement. It just shows where his heart is. And that’s the difference, with her having a sincere Christian faith, and proves that he does not have any faith.”Greene said that her turn away from unrepentant Maga acolyte came in that moment and she abandoned her training “to never apologize and to never admit when you’re wrong”.“As a Christian, I don’t believe in doing that,” she said. “I agree with Erika Kirk, who did the hardest thing possible and said it out loud.” Greene said she later told a friend that after Kirk died, “I realized that I’m part of this toxic culture. I really started looking at my faith. I wanted to be more like Christ.”The Maga landscape post-Kirk has been showing signs of fracture, and Greene has found herself at odds with administration and Republican positions, declaring the war in Gaza a “genocide” as well as casting doubt on economic, healthcare and foreign policy positions that she says do not prioritize working-class Americans.“I was just so naive and outside of politics,” Greene said, adding: “It was easy for me to naively believe.”In a statement to the Guardian, White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said: “President Trump remains the undisputed leader of the greatest and fastest growing political movement in American history – the MAGA movement.“On the other hand, Congresswoman Greene is quitting on her constituents in the middle of her term and abandoning the consequential fight we’re in – we don’t have time for her petty bitterness,” Ingle added.Greene’s break with Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress was, she told the Times, completed over a vote to release investigative files related to the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.Greenesaid the Epstein files represented “everything wrong with Washington” and said it was a story of “rich, powerful elites doing horrible things and getting away with it. And the women are the victims”.After meeting with victims, she claimed, Trump called her and yelled “my friends will get hurt” if the files were released.In the interview, Greene said that she had been wrong to accuse Democrats of treason. She acknowledged that she is now a political outcast from both sides of the political divide.“I’m, like, radioactive,” she acknowledged.“Everyone’s like, ‘She’s changed,’” Greene added. “I haven’t changed my views. But I’ve matured. I’ve developed depth. I’ve learned Washington, and I’ve come to understand the brokenness of the place.”Explore more on these topicsMarjorie Taylor GreeneDonald TrumpRepublicansUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Her previous Renaissance world tour brought in about more than $579m.Her husband,Jay-Z,was the first musician to become a billionaire on Forbes’s list in 2019.Rihanna,Bruce SpringsteenandTaylor Swifthave also achieved the elite status.Though Beyoncé has launched several ventures including a hair care brand, Cécred, a whiskey label called SirDavis and a clothing line calledIvy Park, most of her personal wealth comes from her music – including revenue from her catalogue and from her global tours – according to Forbes.In 2010, she founded Parkwood Entertainment, a management and production company, bringing control of all her artistic ventures – including music, concerts and documentaries – in house.Her 2024 albumCowboy Carterwas critically acclaimed, winning Beyoncé her first album of the year Grammy. The tour that followed the album’s release was the world’s highest-grossing music tour of 2025.

But this year it has made the headlines as a bear hotspot, as the country reels from a year of record ursine encounters and deaths, with warnings that winter will not bring immediate respite.“This year has been particularly bad,” says Kazuhide Otomo, an official in the town’s rural environment development division. “There have always been bears in this region, so people got used to them. But this year is different … it’s the biggest topic of conversation.”In Naruko Onsen, groups of hikers equipped withsuzubells and repellent spray head into the forest to catch the last of the autumn colours, while posters at the local tourism office warn visitors in multiple languages how to protect themselves.1:27Bells and whistles: how our reporter prepared for visiting bear hotspot – videoTourist numbers are lower than in a typical year, while localryokaninns say guests are cancelling their reservations.Satoru Onoma, who runs a coffee shop, admits he is experiencing bear fatigue after months of intense media coverage. “It’s hard to ignore the bear problem because it’s been all over the news,” he said, adding that he had not encountered the animals during his rare trips outside. “But I’ve heard plenty of stories about people spotting bears in the mountains.”Osaki authorities have reported 400 sightings so far this year, compared with fewer than 100 in 2024. In one incident, a woman in her 70s suffered serious injuries to her face when she was attacked outside her home after picking vegetables. In another, residents saw a bear grab and run off with their dog.Similar encounters have been reported in regions acrossJapan, with the northernmost prefectures at the centre of anunprecedented waveof attacks.Map showing the location of Osaki, a Japanese town which is best known for its Naruko Onsen hot springs and autumn foliage.Osaki is best known for its Naruko Onsen hot springs and autumn foliage.A record 13 people died in suspected bear maulings nationwide between April and November, according to the environment ministry, while the number of attacks stood at 197 – another high.Experts say hungry bears are venturing into residential and built-up areas in search of food after poor crops of acorns and beechnuts in their natural habitat.Japan’s bear population is growing, with one estimate putting the number of Asian black bears at 44,000 – compared with 15,000 estimated in 2012, although the species is identified as “vulnerable” on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s “red list” of threatened species. That figure does not include Hokkaido, thought to be home to about 12,000 Ussuri brown bears, whose population has more than doubled since 1990.Sightings have been reported on the western tip of the main island of Honshu, fuelling concern that the animals could appear on Kyushu – where they were previously thought to be extinct – which lies 650 metres away across the Kanmon Straits.The colder weather would once have eased fears, as the animals, fattened up on beechnuts and acorns, disappeared to hibernate until the spring. But their increasinglydesperate search for foodis forcing them to delay hibernation.The problem is compounded by a shortage of licensed hunters – many of whom are ageing and have little or no experience of killing bears – and the disappearance of naturalsatoyamaborders that separate forests from villages in ageing farming communities.View image in fullscreenA poster outside the tourist office in Naruko Onsen advises hikers on how to avoid encounters with bears, and what to do if they come across one of the animals.Photograph: Justin McCurry/The GuardianAs a result, northern prefectures are experiencing a surge in bear sightings even in December and January.Earlier this month an 80-year-old man – a member of a local hunting club – was found dead near a trapped bear on a mountain, according to police. Another man in his 70s was attacked as he cleared snow from in front of his home.Toshio Mizoguchi, an expert on bear countermeasures, told broadcaster NHK that between 2019 and 2023 the number of reported sightings in the region in December stood at between 30 to 50. That soared to 284 the following year, and has stayed consistent at 271 sightings so far this year – a phenomenon Mizoguchi attributed toprolonged searches for persimmonsas the animals load up on nutrients before hibernating.“Now black bears have begun invading even Japan’s urban spaces,” Maki Yamamoto, an associate professor at Nagaoka University of Technology who specialises in wildlife management, wrote on theNippon.comwebsite this month. “We must begin to approach wildlife management as a national policy issue rather than an isolated problem confined to remote mountain communities.”Authorities in Osaki declared a state of emergency they initially expected to lift at the end of November. The measures, though, will stay in place until the end of the year, as sightings continue. Residents are advised not to go out early in the morning or late at night – when they are more likely to encounter bears – and to strip their trees of persimmons and other fruit that are becoming part of the animals’ changing diet.“Bears are clever animals,” Otomo said. “If they find something good to eat, like a sweet persimmon, in a particular place they remember and keep going back for more. In the past, bears would often run away when they saw humans, but they are becoming accustomed to people and no longer see them as dangerous.”Public anxiety prompted the governor of Akita prefecture – where most sightings have been reported – tocall in the self-defence forcesto trap and dispose of bears, although they are not permitted to shoot them.View image in fullscreenTraditional kokeshi dolls outside the railway station at Naruko Onsen in northern Japan. The dolls, carved from a single piece of wood, are popular souvenirs for visitors to Japanese onsen resorts.Photograph: Justin McCurry/The GuardianThe prefecture’s governor, Kenta Suzuki, said he had taken the unprecedented step after four people were killed and 62 others injured in attacks. “One of the characteristics of this year is that these incidents are taking place in urban areas,” he said, adding that the prefecture had culled more than 2,000 bears this year.“We’re hearing about people opening their front doors to find a bear on their doorstep, or roaming in their garden,” he said. “The fact that this is happening near people’s homes is causing high levels of fear.“We’ve been criticised for our decision to cull a large number of bears, but we’re not doing this because we want to … it’s because of the damage they are causing in urban areas and to agriculture. It’s unavoidable.”In Osaki, residents hope 2026 could bring relief, since poor beechnut harvests appear to occur in two-year cycles – a phenomenon some scientists have attributed to theclimate crisisand intense summer heat. If the pattern persists, there should be plenty of food, and far fewer hungry bears roaming towns and villages next year.But it also means that the following year could see a return to more frequent sightings, injuries and deaths.“It’s about striking a balance between protecting residents and preserving bears’ natural habitats,” Otomo said. “We have to make sure there is a clear division between the bear and human populations. But as long as bears continue to lose their fear of people, the problem won’t go away.”Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

That question is increasingly at the heart of our national political debate. And it has become a more urgent one this week as the Conservatives and Reform UK call for the British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah to be stripped of his UK citizenship overracist and offensive tweets he published 10 to 15 years ago.Abd el-Fattah’s social media activity was thrust into the spotlight after he was finally allowed to arrive in the UK last week after a decade spent as a political prisoner in Egypt. The tweets unearthed were vile: they included calls to “kill all Zionists” and to burn down Downing Street during the 2011 riots. Abd el-Fattah has apologised for those remarks.The row is awkward for Labour and theConservativesgiven that successive British governments have campaigned for his release, which became a consular issue in 2021 when he was granted UK citizenship. It is difficult to imagine, however, politicians such as Nigel Farage or Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, calling for Abd el-Fattah to lose his British passport were he not a dual national from a minority ethnic background.Downing Streetstood firmon Monday on the grounds that he had a right to consular support like any other British citizen. Indeed, many Britons who find themselves unfairly detained abroad have dual nationality or foreign heritage.Arguably the two most high-profile cases are those ofNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian mother who was allowed to return to the UK in 2022 after six years of detention in Tehran, andJimmy Lai, the 78-year-old Hong Kong media tycoon who faces life in prison after being convicted by Chinese authorities of colluding with foreign forces.Their cases demonstrate the multitude of routes there are to becoming British. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was naturalised after living in the UK for years and marrying a British man, Richard Ratcliffe. Lai gained British citizenship in 1996, the last year that Hong Kong was under British rule before the handover to China. Abd el-Fattah was entitled to citizenship under the British Nationality Act 1981 because his mother is a British national, having been born in the UK while her mother was studying here.For the majority of Britons there is nothing wrong or even remarkable about this, and becoming British is something that is rooted in shared values such as obeying the law, raising children to be kind, and working hard.A new report by the Institute for Public Policy Research indicates that while that remains the case,a rising proportion of voters now believe Britishness is something you are born with– a product of your ethnicity and ancestry, not something you can obtain. According to the IPPR’s findings, 36% of people now think you must be born British to be truly British, up from 19% in 2023.The Reform UK and Tory approaches to Abd el-Fattah’s case demonstrate how in mainstream politics the Overton window has shifted on questions of national identity and cohesion. Both rightwing parties have come under fire during the past year for apparently endorsingpolicies that would result in the mass deportation of people living legally in the UK.Keir Starmer has shown a desire to put these questions at the heart of his government and his political campaigning. In his speech to the Labour party conference,he cast the next election as a battle for the soul of the countrybetween his own progressive patriotism and Farage’s brand of incendiary nationalist politics.But his own ministers and MPs privately argue that Starmer has been too slow or sheepish in making those arguments during moments of crises – such asTommy Robinson’s far-right march through Westminster– and that he must go further.Or as the IPPR puts it, “animating an alternative vision of nation cannot be outsourced to a few speeches or policies”. It requires the prime minister to tell a story about what Britain is and what he wants it to be.Explore more on these topicsBritish identity and societyKeir StarmerLabourNigel FarageReform UKConservativesanalysisShareReuse this content"

There’s a lot for the creative director to reflect on: more than 5,000 events have taken place and £51m has been spent during a year that was by far the biggest city of culturesince the project started in 2013.Her personal highlights include the opening ceremony Rise in January, when temperaturesgot as low as -8C; seeing 600 people turn up to the start of The Bradford Progress – Jeremy Deller and Charles Hazlewood’ssprawling musical epicwith the Paraorchestra; and the exhibition of Victor Wedderburn’s photographs that capturedBlack Bradford in the mid-1980s.“Also how much audiences and people saw themselves in the work and all communities of that were recognised,” she adds. “The way artists have actually absolutely fallen in love with the city and the people and said, ‘We wouldn’t have known this place if it hadn’t been for this opportunity.’”The artistic director is understandably basking in the afterglow of a successful year. But as with the end of any city of culture, questions linger. Can the energy that was generated during 2025 be sustained? Will the talent who built the programme stay? Perhaps, most importantly, will the city experience an economic boost? In other words, what will the legacy look like?In Bradford those questions are particularly urgent. The city has some of the mostdeprived areas in the country. About 40% of Bradford’s children are living below the poverty line, while 12% of working age people have no qualifications. City of culture was never going to be a panacea but it offered some much needed optimism.View image in fullscreenBird’s eye view inside Darley Street market in Bradford’s city centre.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianWalking through the city centre, there are signs of the need. Next to the shiny new Darley Street market and in the shadow of colourful hoardings created by thelocal artist Ben Holdensit tents and empty shops. Homelessness and vacancies aren’t distinctly Bradfordian issues but it does havemore empty shops than most cities in the country.That backdrop partially explains why the celebrations were so wild whenBradfordwon the bid in May 2022. “Things like this don’t happen here” was the refrain that echoed but the circus was coming to town.Evie Manning, the co-artistic director of theatre company Common Wealth, recalls being told by a theatre critic for a national newspaper that city of culture was just “a branding exercise for failing cities”. At first the Bradfordian found the comment insulting but witnessing 2025 up close she recognises there’s more than a kernel of truth in the statement.“When you grow up here, you really do believe it’s the worst place in the UK because you are told that the whole time,” she says. “This year has made people look and think about living here differently. There’s a whole generation of young people coming up who won’t believe what I did about Bradford.”Gulzar’s task wasn’t just about curation or changing attitudes – it was also about a hyper-localised “levelling up” agenda and she wants to show me around some of the places city of culture investment has touched.We head to the 1 in 12 Club, which is run by anarchists and has been open since 1981. Located in an old fabric warehouse, it was showing its age. An initial injection of £90,000 was doubled after work started and the scale of the task in front of the collective who own the building became apparent. Fire doors had gaps in them, an old kitchen was more of a dumping ground, the electrics needed some serious TLC. Now they’re dreaming of installing a lift after receiving more heritage funding.It’s obvious why Gulzar wants to show me around the club: this is exactly the kind of thing that wouldn’t have happened if city of culture hadn’t come to town. “We’ve become more muscular,” says Gulzar. “The arts sector has gotten stronger. It knows that the work it makes is of consequence, it matters, it’s appreciated and it’s needed.” In total £9m was pumped into capital projects around the city, the first time investing in existing infrastructure has been part of the project’s remit.They also installed the first visitor toilets at the Brontë Parsonage Museum; relocated the Peace Museum to Salts Mill where its annual visitors increased from 3,000 per year to more than 50,000; and they installed a lift at Ilkley Playhouse. None of that is sexy. But in a city with a council that by its own admission faces financial challenges which rank “among the most significant in local government nationally”, it is work that simply would not have happened otherwise.Not everyone has been won over by the city of culture year. Ishtiaq Ahmed, an independent councillor from the Heaton ward of the city, is more sceptical. Although the event organiser says it put on events in all 30 wards, he feels not enough was done to bring in non-traditional arts audiences. “The whole point of it was that we kind of reach a wider audience,” he says. “Have we just reached those that were already in the know?Its impact shouldn’t just be felt by those who are already plugged in.”His other point is about legacy. He asks: “Will this investment lead to long-term funding, stronger grassroots support, opportunities across Bradford’s neighbourhoods or will the momentum just fade away once the banners come down?”We don’t yet know the answers to those questions, but the long-term health of other city of culture projects paints a difficult picture. Hull lost momentum once the chief executive of its legacy company left two years after its 12 months in the spotlight, while Derry hadno money for legacy projectsand Coventry’s post-event programmeended up in administration. All of those cities benefited from the year but turning the short-term investment into long-term uplift was very difficult.In Bradford, it’s not clear how much of the 2025 budget is left but it will be ploughed back into cultural events via Bradford Culture Company Ltd, with projects planned until 2027. The 200-capacity Loading Bay venue, which was a temporary space that hosted events throughout the year, will hopefully become a permanent – much needed – mid-sized venue.The delayed opening of Bradford Live has meant the city now has a 3,500-capacity venue in its centre. But whether the city can sustain it and the smaller Alhambra and St George’s Hall remains to be seen. Abundance is not a problem Bradford is used to having.The most important part of the legacy might be intangible though – the kind of thing that can’t be measured but felt. I speak to Jane Gray and Adam Metcalfe, two members of the Bantam of the Opera choir which was formed during 2025 and was composed of Bradford City fans who sang on Sports Personality of the Year.“At Bradford City matches now we’ve got a new chant and it goes ‘City of culture you’ll never sing that’,” says Metcalfe. Coventry and Hull fans might have something to say about that but the chant shows how much 2025 has bled into the wider community.Gray has been amazed at the impact city of culture has had.“I think it’s brought everybody together,” she says. “And things like the Darley Street market being finished, it just seems to have … a sense of hope and possibility. The closing ceremony was all about looking forward and people rising again. It was very empowering and I think that summed up this year.”Bantam of the Opera will continue beyond 2025, and many in Bradford will hope their cultural awakening does too.Explore more on these topicsBradfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Netflix dramaAdolescence– which tells the story of a 13-year-old boy arrested for killing a female classmate – was hailed from the school gates to the Houses of Parliament for shedding a spotlight on the toxic influence of themanosphere.But the national conversation did not end with the final episode of the much-discussed drama. A series of high-profile campaigns, conversations, policy shifts and research have resulted in a sense that 2025 has been the year of the boy.At the start of the year the former England football manager Gareth Southgatewarned about the dangers of “callous, manipulative and toxic influencers”, whileLost Boys, a study from the Centre for Social Justice, argued that “boys [were] being left behind” from educational attainment to mental health.View image in fullscreenAdolescence drew widespread praise for its portrayal of a 13-year-old boy being radicalised online.Photograph: APIn June wasthe first ever “Dad strike”, when fathers gathered inLondon and Edinburghto protest at pitifully poor paternity leave provision in the UK. By November, the government had produced the first everMen’s Health Strategy for England, a month later itsViolence Against Women and Girls strategyfocused on preventingmisogynistic behaviour in boys.Warnings about toxic masculinity have been stark. But after a year in which debate about men and boys moved from the fringes of the internet to the mainstream, experts and policy-makers are urging progressive figures to focus less on toxicity and more on positive role models.Among them is a collection of Labour MPs who in Marchstarted organising via a ballooning WhatsApp groupand have now formed a formal parliamentary group – the Labour group for men and boys.One member, Natalie Fleet, the MP for Bolsover, spent her allotted time atan International Men’s Day debate in parliamentspeaking about the amazing men in her community – including her husband, an “actual hero” whom she met aged 16, and helped raise her first child and is now reducing his hours to help look after their grandchildren.She said: “These are men in our communities doing the right thing, who we need to find and amplify, and that’s what we can do through this group.”View image in fullscreenNatalie Fleet, the MP for Bolsolver, says there ‘are men in our communities doing the right thing, who we need to find and amplify’.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianIn 2025, the influence of misogynistic figures such as Andrew Tate showed little sign of abating – despite facing charges, which he denies, in multiple jurisdictions. Tatetravelled to the USand cemented his role as a leading figure in Trumpworld. A poll earlier this year found that a fifth of UK males aged 16 to 29 who had heard of Tatehad a positive view of him.But other organisations have parked their tanks on Tate’s lawn.MovemberandEquimundolaunched theYoung Men and Media Collectivein October, which funds influencers to deliver a different kind of masculine message.“Policymakers have woken up to the fact that, particularly online, young men are being harmed and their health is suffering by the content they’re seeing,” said Amy O’Connor, policy lead at the charity. “It’s all very well criticising online content, but what are we doing to give our young men an alternative?”The phrase “men’s rights” comes with “a whole bunch of really unpleasant connotations”, said Adam Thompson, MP for Erewash, but there’s also a recognition that from educational attainment to suicide rates, boys and men, as much as girls and women, need targeted policy. “I’m a strong believer that the patriarchy is harmful to both men and women,” he said. “It’s not a zero-sum game.”It’s right that public discourse is focusing on boys, argues Joeli Brearley, the founder of the campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed. The lack of debate about the challenges boys face led her to launch this year a podcast,To Be a Boy,which she hosts with the fatherhood champion Elliott Rae.I want my sons to know masculinity can be kind – and my daughter to live without fear | David LammyRead moreBrearley urges caution, however. The rise of the far right, a surge in support for Reform UK and the prospect of baked-insexism in increasingly pervasive AI toolshave left her worried.“We are having these really fruitful conversations about boys, but I’m also seeing a sea change in the way women talk about their experiences online,” she said. “It’s as if you can’t have both – we’re not allowed now to talk about the fact that women are still experiencing specific challenges because we’re now saying that men have it hard.”The desire to combat a spike in more traditional – and regressive – masculine ideals is also rising exponentially, said George Gabriel, the co-founder ofThe Dad Shift. “The challenge is real. But I think we can acknowledge that while the situation is dire, we can also have some optimism that we are starting to find a path forward. That’s where we find ourselves at the end of the year.”Explore more on these topicsMenViolence against women and girlsAdolescenceAndrew TateMen's healthMaternity & paternity rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

If we travel to an office, it’s likely to involve either peak-time public transport or stressful traffic. You might not expect that either of those offers much scope for joy, but there are things we can do to make them more enjoyable, productive and healthier. It’s worth putting some thought into this, becausecommuting can increase stress, reduce capacity for exercise and encourage us to consume extra calories in on-the-go snacks.The former lawyer turned time management coachKelly Nolansuggests starting with a commute audit to assess its true impact. “Begin by blocking it out on a calendar. Creating a visual representation of how much commuting takes out of your day gives an accurate picture. It’s not just about how much free time you have left, it’s about seeing how commuting affects other activities in your life.”If you’re stuck on a bus, rather than scrolling, you could use the time to brainstorm a specific ideaThe point is not to descend into a spiral of doom but to get creative about how to maximise your available time. One strategy is to buildhabit stackinginto your commute to get other things done. Because going to work is something that you already do every day, piggybacking another activity to the routine makes it more likely that it will happen. That might mean building fitness into journeys by cycling, or walking part of the way, or running home. But it might also mean learning a language, meditating,doing admin or catching up with friends. The averageUK commute is 27 minutes, rising to38 minutes in London. That adds up to about five hours a week that people who commute every day have to themselves.Nolan says commuting has the clear benefit of offering a structured, regular window to focus on an idea or project. She references Cal Newport’s bestsellerDeep Work, in which he suggests we can use chunks of time to focus deeply on one topic. “So if you’re stuck on a bus, rather than scrolling, you could use the time to brainstorm a specific idea, either for work or a personal project,” says Nolan. “One reason ideas often come to us in the shower is because we’re so rarely quiet and still so ideas don’t have the opportunities to come to mind.”View image in fullscreenPiggybacking another activity to the routine makes it more likely that it will happen.Photograph: Posed by model; ljubaphoto/Getty ImagesThis does sound appealing. What if, instead of gritting my teeth as I enter Dante’s Seventh Circle (line) of hell, I could reframe it as two daily creative brainstorming sessions? In fact, I know this is possible. I have a friend who wrote a novel on his daily commute from Brighton to London and another who uses the time to work on her new business idea.But how do we maintain positivity in the face of transport delays, or not getting a seat and standing trapped between a rucksack and someone’s sweaty armpit? The solution, saysGordon McCrorie, a Glasgow-based life coach, lies in the concept of acceptance. “A lot of life’s emotional friction comes when what we would like life to be is not matched by reality. If we can bridge that gap, we are going to remove a lot of unnecessary suffering. Ask yourself: ‘What is within my control? Have I tried to alter that? What is out of my control? What stories am I telling myself?’” Avoiding exaggerated language is one of his tips. Is the journey really a nightmare or is it just a bit frustrating? “Think data, not drama,” he says. “This train is running 15 minutes late. Is there anything I can do about that? No. OK. In which case, settle down and enjoy the extra free time. You were planning on listening to a podcast? Well, now it’s going to be a podcast and a half.”For the journey home, it can be helpful to establish rituals that signal to your brain that you are leaving work behind. “I love listening to fun audiobooks,” says Nolan. “Anything that will take us out of work mode – a comedy podcast, listening to a playlist – will work. Or you could use the time to send an urgent email so you don’t need to do it later. A lot of people really struggle with the delineations between work and home.”View image in fullscreenA post-work walk can help reduce stress.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesWhich brings us to the dilemma facing many people who work from home or do hybrid working. Should we invent a faux commute to ease the transition? For McCrorie, when he is working from home, his day is bookended with dog walks. He suggests that even if you don’t have a canine friend, it’s a good idea to get outdoors or at least get moving. “If you don’t, that stagnant stiffness is going to linger as you go into your working day. Movement is a great way to reduce anxiety and stress. Even something as simple as stretching for a few minutes can regulate the nervous system.”So conveniently rolling out of bed five minutes before the first Zoom meeting isn’t to be encouraged? “If you don’t create a buffer between waking up and work, what is your experience going to be like? If you did take the time, the impact that work has on you would be less by the end of the day, because percentage-wise less of your waking hours would be dominated by it,” McCrorie says.Not that everyone who works at home needs a pretend commute. Nolan lives in Minnesota, where the climate can make going outdoors more of an expedition than a stroll. “Some people actually have really great boundaries between home and work,” she says. “It’s definitely easier if you have a separate office so you can open and close the door to signify the beginning and end of work. But I know someone who has a special pair of work slippers to get into and out of work mode. For them, that’s enough of a boundary.”Explore more on these topicsCommutingHow to have a better dayWork-life balanceWork & careersRail transportPublic transportRoad transportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Asura was a total knockout – a rich and sumptuously shot drama about four sisters in the 70s who discover that their dad has been having a lifelong affair. It was so good, in fact, that it might even be the most beautiful show they’ve ever released. Talk about selling yourself short.Watch it on Netflix.#1 Happy Family USAView image in fullscreenEasily one of the funniest shows of the year … #1 Happy Family USA.Photograph: Courtesy of PrimeNot content with creatingTV’s best sitcomabout life as a young, 2020s US Muslim, Ramy Youssef decided to createTV’s best sitcomabout life as a super-young 00s US Muslim. Packed with retro references to appeal to nostalgic millennials, and full of dark comedy about the US’s anti-Muslim bent in the wake of 9/11, it was a idiosyncratically satirical joy. Easily one of the funniest shows of the year.Watch it on Prime Video.Common Side EffectsIt’s not often that the year’s best conspiracy thriller is a cartoon. But that might just be the case, given the phenomenal watchability of Mike Judge’s animated tale of fungi expert Marshall, who finds a mushroom that cures all illnesses and even brings people back from the dead. When big pharma weigh in to stop his discovery ruining their profits, it becomes a wild, blackly comic tale of guns, death and love – plus how deeply in thrall the US is to profit. If this phenomenal show was an acted drama, it’s hard not to believe that it would’ve been one of the most watched shows of the year.Watch it on Channel 4.Mix TapeView image in fullscreenGorgeous … Florence Hunt and Rory Walton-Smith as young Alison and Daniel in Mix Tape.Photograph: BBC/© 2024 Subotixa (Mix Tape)/Leanne SullivanA gorgeous romantic drama that hadeverybody digging out their own mixtapesand sharing smile-raising memories. Pitched as One Day but grittier, the four-parter followed teenagers Daniel (Rory Walton-Smith) and Alison (Florence Hunt) falling in love in Sheffield, in 1989. Twenty years later, Daniel (Jim Sturgess) has stayed put and is a music journalist, while Alison (Teresa Palmer) is a successful novelist in Sydney – but unanswered questions from the past reconnect them. Each performance was affecting as dark truths unravelled and, crucially, the soundtrack was full of back-to-back bangers.Watch it on BBC iPlayer.Once Upon a Time in SpaceView image in fullscreenDazzling … Once Upon a Time in Space.Photograph: BBC/KEO Films/NASAFrom the makers of similar oral histories of the Iraq war and the Troubles, this dazzling documentary managed a remarkable trick. It was both a grand survey of the vaulting ambition of the space race and a very personal, emotional history explaining what becoming an astronaut actually meant to the few people who managed it. The indelible tales include African American astronauts who felt that their acceptance on to space exploration programmes showed that the times really were changing, a female astronaut who (temporarily) said goodbye to her very young child and the story of a lovely friendship between a Russian astronaut and an American one. The best bits of this series are genuinely unforgettable.Watch it on BBC iPlayer.Everybody’s LiveWhat made John Mulaney’s live weekly Netflix talkshow so absorbing was its full embrace of the medium. Shows like this tend to operate best when they find a groove, but Mulaney resolutely rejected this notion, preferring constant change to suffocating comfort. He’d let segments grind to a halt so that he could interview John Cale. He hosted a whole episode blindfolded. The climax came with his decision to fight two boys at once. Nothing else on TV in 2025 was quite this magnetic.Watch it on Netflix.Chad PowersView image in fullscreenWinning charm … Glen Powell in Chad Powers.Photograph: Disney+On paper, Glen Powell’s comedy was certifiably bananas. It was the story of a disgraced yet talented American footballer who (for genuinely inexplicable reasons) decides that his way back into the game should be to swaddle himself in complicated prosthetics and pass himself off as someone else. As creepy as this sounds, Powell managed to completely sell it, playing both sides of his split personality with the right amount of winning charm.Watch it on Disney+.The Horne Section TV ShowIn an age when television comedies are still defined by a sense of trauma, The Horne Section was the antidote. A brazenly silly 1970s-style sitcom about Taskmaster’s Alex Horne and his band trying to put on a weekly chatshow from his house, the show was loaded with big-name guest stars (John Oliver, Reggie Watts) having the absolute time of their lives. The whole thing was about as gleefully stupid as television gets. More please.Watch it on Channel 4.Long Story ShortView image in fullscreenShould have been watched by everyone! … Long Story Short.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixFollowing BoJack Horseman – one of Netflix’s all-time great shows – should have been an impossible task. However, Raphael Bob-Waksberg managed to return with something even more layered and complicated. An animated comedy about a Jewish family, Long Story Short spent its episodes flitting backwards and forwards through the years, leaving viewers to fill in the gaps of what happened in the interim. Something this personal and ambitious should have been watched by far more people.Watch it on Netflix.ReunionView image in fullscreenA real curio … Matthew Gurney and Lara Peake in Reunion.Photograph: Matt Squire/BBC/Warp FilmsIn an era of cookie-cutter crime dramas, Reunion felt like a real curio. Starring Matthew Gurney as Daniel Brennan and written by deaf scriptwriter William Mager, it put deafness at the heart of its story and utilised British Sign Language to dramatic effect. Reunion didn’t feel tokenistic in any way; instead, Daniel’s struggles to communicate – and various institutional failures to accommodate people with his needs – contributed to the air of despairing menace he exuded. As he returned from prison and attempted to reconnect with his daughter Carly (Lara Peake), his tragic backstory emerged gradually and the drama that resulted was nuanced, intriguing and eventually explosive.Watch it on BBC iPlayer.WaywardView image in fullscreenMasterly … Toni Collette in Wayward.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/NetflixThe eminently lovable Canadian standup Mae Martin has been a breezy Taskmaster star and charmed the pants off us in their tender and hilarious – if trauma-inflected – romcom Feel Good. So a bleak, supernatural thriller about a terrifying institution for troubled teens wasn’t exactly their most obvious next move. But Wayward was such a masterly invocation of the chilling ambience of small-town life, in which everyone seems to know something you don’t (aided by Toni Collette’s spooky turn as the local academy’s head, Evelyn) that it felt like the work of a seasoned horror writer. Martin’s presence brought the warmth and comic relief that was much needed with such dark fare driving the plot – and turned it into a must-watch.Watch it on Netflix.Lucy Letby: Beyond Reasonable DoubtEveryone knows the tale of how neonatal nurse Lucy Letby murdered seven babies and tried to kill another seven. Or do they? This compelling, meticulous documentary – featuring the Guardian’s Josh Halliday (who has followed the case from the start) as an empathic guide to the murky affair – takes you through the flaws in the case against Letby, alternative explanations for evidence that begins to seem far from unreasonable and the lack of any obvious motive for Letby to commit these crimes. It takes little-known, but hugely problematic, issues with one of the most infamous convictions of recent years and brings them to wider attention in a compelling manner. This is documentary making at its best – not just a TV show, but a public service.Watch it on ITVX.Down Cemetery RoadView image in fullscreenSupremely badass … Emma Thompson and Ruth Wilson in Down Cemetery Road.Photograph: Matt Towers/Matt Towers/Apple TV+Emma Thompson was the crime drama lead Gary Oldman wishes he could be in this second TV adaptation from author Mick Herron’s novels after Slow Horses. Unfailingly likable and supremely badass, while also capable of showing genuine humanity, Zoe Boem was a fantastic entry into the world of TV detectives as she tailed Ruth Wilson around a brutal hunt for a missing child, never failing to be zippily sarcastic as bullets flew and bodies piled up. This deserved far bigger audiences, but given that the antics of the Slough House ne’er do wells took multiple seasons to rack up the viewers, fingers crossed this manages the same feat.Watch it on Apple TV.Asterix and the Big FightView image in fullscreenBracingly modern … Asterix and the Big Fight.Photograph: PRAsterix fans have learned to avoid its animated adaptations, because you’re unlikely to ever find a patchier bunch of output. Happily, The Big Fight proved to be an exception. This series was deliberately, bracingly modern. It found an emotional backbone. It played with the form (complete with sports commentary, musical montages and a Pocoyo spoof). Plus it introduced a perfect new minor character. After all, if you live in a village with Asterix, Obelix and Getafix, wouldn’t you also want a Netflix?Watch it on Netflix.The Narrow Road to the Deep NorthView image in fullscreenSpellbinding … The Narrow Road to the Deep North.Photograph: BBC/Curio Pictures/Sony Pictures TelevisionBoth Jacob Elordi and Ciarán Hinds turned out spellbinding performances as the younger and older doctor Dorrigo in this sexy second world war epic about love, trauma and the things your psyche never lets you leave behind. Adapted from Richard Flanagan’s Booker-winning novel, it confidently paired tender scenes of love and poetry-reading with harrowing images of war, showing Dorrigo’s time as a prisoner of war forced to build the Burma railway. But despite being a visceral and often horrifying watch, it simultaneously managed to be a lovely tale of longing, as Dorrigo falls for his uncle’s wife Amy – and given how it turned out, it’s no wonder he spent a lifetime yearning to feel that way again.Watch it on BBC iPlayer.North of NorthView image in fullscreenFunny, charming and super snowy … North of North.Photograph: PRWelcome to the town of I​ce Cove​ in the Canadian Arctic, where everyone knows absolutely everyone’s business. So when Inuk woman Siaja explodes her life by publicly dumping the town golden boy (known as King Ting), she gets it in the neck – and every other local woman starts bringing Ting casseroles as love tokens. With episodes called things like Joy to the Effing World and ​Walrus ​Dick ​Baseball (yes they really do play it) ​this was a funny, charming and super snowy sitcom about growing up and becoming yourself. Perfect winter binge​-watching fare​.Watch it on Netflix.The EternautKiller snow that wipes out Earth? It’s one hell of a hook for a dystopia. But Bruno Stagnaro’s gripping Argentine story, based on Héctor Germán Oesterheld’s novel, also doubled as an absolutely terrifying reflection of our world. It begins with a group of men who are safely tucked inside playing poker. They soon learn that anyone who steps outside in the mysterious snow collapses and instantly dies. As they work out how to search for fellow survivors, they soon discover what is really causing chaos … Is there any hope? A second series has been confirmed to send chills down spines once more.Watch it on Netflix.ForeverView image in fullscreenFalling into you … Lovie Simone as Keisha and Michael Cooper Jr as Justin in Forever.Photograph: Elizabeth Morris/NetflixMillennials of a certain stripe will always have an indelible bond to Judy Blume’s Forever …, the tale of teenage love that was for many a first look at sex (complete with a penis unforgettably named Ralph.) So there was much excitement when this year brought us this adaptation, which updated the action to 2018 and centred around Black students Keisha and Justin, brilliantly played by Lovie Simone and Michael Cooper (rare actors in a teen drama who actually, and thankfully, look age-appropriate). As they went on trainer shopping dates and blocked/unblocked each other, we couldn’t help but fall for them as they were falling for each other. Lovely.Watch it on Netflix.Miss AustenIt’s been a bumper year for Jane Austen fans, as the BBC celebrated the novelist’s 250th birthday. But this lovely period drama, based on Gill Hornby’s bestselling novel, was a standout treat. Keeley Hawes played Jane’s sister Cassandra, who burned many of the private letters sent between the pair after Jane (Patsy Ferran) died. Through flashbacks to the sisters’ early years, we learn one reason that could explain why Cassie set them alight. Synnøve Karlsen, Rose Leslie and Jessica Hynes complete a wonderful cast.Watch it on BBC iPlayer.The AssassinView image in fullscreenA menopausal hitwoman with an axe to grind … Keeley Hawes as Julie in The Assassin.Photograph: Des Willie/Amazon Prime VideoThriller concepts don’t get much more fun than following the blood-soaked trail of a menopausal hitwoman with an axe to grind. And this Keeley Hawes-starring show certainly leaned into the chaos: monster body counts, shady corporate dealings, a twentysomething son forced to go on the run with his mum while simultaneously discovering she was a hired killer, it had it all. No wonder, given that it was the latest show from the Williams Brothers – the brains behind The Tourist, The Missing and Boat Story.Watch it on Prime Video.This article was amended on 29 December 2025. An earlier version said that in Reunion, Daniel Brennan attempted to reconnect with his daughter Miri, played by Rose Ayling-Ellis, however Miri is not his daughter. Brennan’s daughter is Carly, played by Lara Peake, and it was with Carly that he tried to reconnect.Explore more on these topicsTelevision2025 in TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After all the carolling, gifting and tree-ing (not to mention the eating and drinking) of the actual Christmassy bit, it feels almost cruel to have to do it all again, and on – in my opinion – one of the most stressful nights of the year: New Year’s Eve.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If you’re not paying over the odds and going out, with long queues and stressed-out staff, you’re the stressed-out one yourself. “Is everyone good for drinks?” “When was the last time anyone saw [insert child’s name here]?” And then there’s the clean glass matrix, where no one can remember whose is whose and you’re caught in an endless cycle of washing-up. The antidote to all of the above is, for me, just to stay in with your immediates and a bottle of something nice. Five guests maximum. I don’t like going into the New Year already tense – what hope will I have for 2026 if I’m going into it with high blood pressure and flat wine in a warm glass?Obviously, the done thing here is sparkling wine, and there are a few options out there. Champagne is the most obvious one. The sort you’ll find in the supermarket will have “NV” on the label, meaning it’s a blend of vintages, so the wine is classified “non-vintage”. Unless you’ve had a particularly liquid 2025, this is the sort of thing you’ll want if you’re planning on watering more than three people. If the champagne has a year on the label, meanwhile, it’s “vintage”: more expensive, yes, but also more expressive of a time and place for the producer.How about prosecco? If you’re already a fan, you’ll know exactly the one you want to drink. But if you don’t think prosecco’s for you, on account of its usual sweetness, I have a good work-around: to find a dry prosecco, look for bottles with “brut” or “extra brut” on the label, and perhaps you’ll find something more pleasurable.And this will be the last time this year I recommend lambrusco, from Emilia-Romagna, the most easily recognisable versions of which are a deep, inky pink with a candyfloss foam (I dida whole column on the stuffearlier this year). Try it with cured meat.This time last year, I went all inon recommending soju, a Korean drink distilled from rice and often fruit-flavoured, for a party. I still stand by that, not least because it’s designed to be shared between friends. No need to neck it, though, because it’s incredibly pleasant to sip. Or mix it with a light beer, such as rice beer or lager, to create a lightly flavoured carbonated drink. Currently, my favourites for this are peach and plum, but who knows what next year might bring?Four bottles to get your party off with a bangJinro plum soju£6 (350ml) Morrisons, 13%. Get the party started with a tasty plum soju. Fresh but fleshy.

It defines a nation and its culture – and we must defend itTony Hall was director general of the BBC between April 2013 and August 2020Mon 29 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 12.24 ESTShareDon’t let President Trump cloud the real debate about the BBC. Of course, his demand for damages ofno less than $5bnhas dominated our thinking about the corporation over the past few weeks, as has its cause. But let’s get this into perspective. This was a serious own goal and journalists make mistakes. Salvation in this case would have been a line of script between the clips, or once a mistake had been discovered, a very speedy public acknowledgment. Now, though, the BBC is right not to yield on this. It has apologised. And, unlike other broadcasters and institutions in the United States, it doesn’t need the president’s support. This is a chance to demonstrate the BBC’s independence. Fight on.But we must not let this derail the conversation about what sort of BBC we all want and need, and I hope that is what dominates discussion in the crucial coming year. Thegovernment’s green paper, published in December, starts off with a reminder of what, despite all its travails, the BBC delivers for the country. “It’s not just a broadcaster,” says the introduction, “it’s also a national institution … if it did not already exist, we would have to invent it.” The secretary of state, Lisa Nandy, is even more forthright: “I believe the BBC, alongside the NHS, is one of the two most important institutions in our country. While one is fundamental to the health of our people, the other is fundamental to the health of our democracy.” Seeing the BBC not just as a media organisation, but as a cultural organisation helping to define who we are, is crucial to next year’s debate about what we want the BBC to be. It should be seen as part of our social infrastructure.I think people understand the importance of the BBC to our democracy in providing high-quality, accurate and impartial news. It remains the nation’s most widely used and trusted source of news. It is often the place where people go to check whether something is true or not. And of course globally, we all benefit from theBBC’s news services now reaching about 453 million people each week. This is an example of this country’s soft power which needs to be built on and not, as at present, diminished.View image in fullscreenA Daily Telegraph feature questioning the value of the BBC compared with streaming services, 19 December 2025.But what is less understood – or possibly even believed in – is the BBC’s role as the nation’s storyteller. The streamers do drama, people often say to me, so why do we need a BBC? Well, I’ve been as glued toSlow Horses,Down Cemetery RoadorAdolescenceas the next person. But the truth is that what the streamers like Netflix, Apple or Amazon are commissioning is content that will work on an international scale. And the total number of hours they make about the UK is not in the tens of thousands that the public service broadcasters produce. It’s interesting that audiences continue tospend more time watching BBC TV/iPlayeron average per week per person than they spend with Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime combined. In the first quarter of this year, the BBC hadfive out of the 10 most watched programmes in the UKacross all broadcasters and streamers. ITV had three and Netflix two. And that’s why the idea of public service broadcasting still matters.I watched the immensely powerful documentaryOur Girls– The Southport Families on BBC One, about the three girls murdered in the dreadful attack last year, illustrating the immense courage the families have shown coping with their grief, but also their desire to build something lasting out of the horror. I don’t believe it would have been made by a streamer. You could say the same ofLudwigor the Liverpool-basedThis City Is Ours. And the drama team on BBC Radio 4 – so often taken for granted and relatively unsung – commissions writers old and new on a massive scale to tell the stories that tell us who we are.When I was working for the BBC, we would shy away from the argument that the organisation was also a defence against market failure. Nowadays I think that should be part of why the BBC exists. There are certain genres of programmes that are not ever going to be internationally successful but reflect who we are. Programmes about religion, the arts, music, or shows that reflect who we are in a more gentle way, likeCountryfileorThe Repair Shop. And I lost count of the number of parents who told me how much they valued British content for their children either as toddlers withCBeebiesor later as teenagers withBitesize. And then, of course, there are those moments that bring us all together, from the Cenotaph to Westminster Abbey to the Olympics.View image in fullscreenSaoirse-Monica Jackson as Cheryl Crawford, left, and Hannah Onslow as Diana Williams in the Liverpool-based This City Is Ours.Photograph: James Stack/BBC/Left Bank PicturesTheBBCgives cultural definition to more specific communities too. When I was running the BBC, I talked to the people at Radio Cumbria, for example, who told me how their work helped define a community that is geographically very widespread, especially at times of crisis. These local services, whether in small areas or serving the nations, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, at their best report the stories that matter to their audiences and celebrate the characteristics that make them what they are. Taking this forward is an important role for the BBC.All in all, the BBC is the largest producer of stories about our isles, the people, the places, the communities that make up this diverse and creative nation. Of course, that has a value. The BBC is the largest single investor in UK-made programming, contributing about£4.9bn to the UK economyeach year, half of which is spent outside London.But an even bigger question is how and where our culture is defined. In the end, the only broadcasting organisations that will reflect the UK as its primary purpose are the BBC and Channel 4. Next year, the debate about the BBC charter will rightly encompass funding, governance, reaching new audiences and a host of other issues. But let’s not lose this idea of media as culture.Let’s enjoy what the streamers are offering.

A grand reckoning awaits usRobert ReichI’d like to believe that the horrific darkness of this past year is a necessary prelude to a brighter and saner futureMon 29 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 09.56 ESTShareAbout a year ago, at the start of theTrump2.0 regime, a woman was about to pass me on the sidewalk and then stopped, turned toward me and almost shouted: “It’s a fucking nightmare!”Ithasbeen a “fucking nightmare”.But sometimes a nation needs a nightmare before it can fully awaken to long-simmering crises.Martin Luther King Jrmobilized the nation against racial injustice by making sure almost everyone in the United States saw its horrors – on the nightly news, watching peaceful Black people getting clubbed and arrested for exercising their rights.Trump is shamelessly covering America in his name | Mohamad BazziRead moreWere it not for that painful national exposure to racist brutality, we wouldn’t have gotten the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act.Something similar happened in the first years of the 20th century when muckraking journalists revealed the monopolies, corruption and public-be-damned arrogance of the robber barons.Were it not for that painful national exposure, we wouldn’t have gotten the reforms of the progressive era.A similar dynamic is playing out as Americans witness the nightmare of Trump’s neofascism – its mindless cruelty, blatant attempts to silence critics, wanton destruction of much of our government, open racism and misogyny.Trump has revealed himself in ways his first-term handlers wouldn’t allow – as a sociopath who posts AI cartoons showing himself shitting on millions of Americans who marched against him. A malignant narcissist unable to respond to the tragic killings of Rob and Michele Reiner without making it all about himself. A chronic liar who says prices are dropping when everyone knows they’re rising.As Americans see all this, outrage has been growing. We are beginning to mobilize – not all of us, of course, but the great majority.Record numbers of us marched on 18 October, No Kings day. Democratic candidates have won just about every special election and every mayoral and gubernatorial contest, and a remarkable number of down-ballot races in bright red states and cities. Maga is coming apart. Trump’s polls are tanking.Trump has precipitated a long-overdue reckoning. That reckoning has revealed the rotWe are organizing and mobilizing with a resolve I have not seen in my lifetime.The US had to come to this point. We couldn’t go on as we were, even under Democratic presidents. For 40 years, a narrow economic elite has been siphoning off ever more wealth and power.I’m old enough to remember when the US had the largest and fastest-growing middle class in the world. We adhered to the basic bargain that if someone worked hard and played by the rules, they’d do better than their parents, and their children would do even better.I remember when CEOs took home 20 times the pay of their workers, not 300 times. When members of Congress acted in the interests of their constituents rather than being bribed by campaign donations to do the bidding of big corporations and the super-wealthy.I remember when our biggest domestic challenges were civil rights, women’s rights and gay rights – not the very survival of democracy and the rule of law.But over the last 40 years, starting with Ronald Reagan, the US went off the rails: deregulation, privatization, free trade, wild gambling by Wall Street, union-busting, monopolization, record levels of inequality, stagnant wages for most, staggering wealth for a few, big money taking over our politics.Corporate profits became more important than good jobs and good wages for all, stock buy-backs and the wellbeing of investors more important than the common good.Democratic presidents were better thanRepublicans, to be sure, but the underlying rot worsened. It was undermining the foundations of the US.Trump has precipitated a long-overdue reckoning.That reckoning has revealed the rot.It has also revealed the suck-up cowardice of so many CEOs, billionaires, Wall Street bankers, media moguls, tech titans, Republican politicians and other so-called “leaders” who have stayed silent or actively sought to curry Trump’s favor.America’s so-called “leadership class” is a sham. Most of them do not care a whit for the rest of the US. They are out for themselves.The “fucking nightmare” is not over by any stretch. It’s likely to get worse in 2026 as Trump and his sycophants, and many of America’s “leaders”, realize 2026 may be their last unrestrained year to inflict damage and siphon off the spoils.But the nightmare has awakened much of the US to the truth about what has happened to this country – and what we must do to get it back on the track toward social justice, democracy and widespread prosperity.I’d like to believe that the horrific darkness of this past year is a necessary prelude to a brighter and saner future.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

The expectation was that, as the new duties drove up prices of consumer goods and inputs – affecting households and companies, respectively – surging inflation and falling real incomes would follow. This would be a supply shock, so the US Federal Reserve could not do much to counteract it.Trump did raise tariffs to shocking levels, violatinginternationalagreementsand blowing up the Republican party’soft-professedcommitment to free trade. In terms of severity and disruptiveness, Trump’s 2025 tariffs went far beyond the already harmful tariffs of hisfirst term, and even beyond the infamousSmoot-Hawley Actof 1930. According to the Yale Budget Lab, theaverage effective tariffon US imports rose from2% to 18%, the highest level since the 1930s, this year. Add to that the uncertainty caused by frequent and inexplicable policy changes, and largeadverseeffects on inflation, employment and real incomes appeared all but inevitable.But things did not turn out as anticipated. It is possible thatconsumer price inflation(CPI) did not rise at all: the most recentlyreported rate, for the 12 months ending in November, is 2.7% – the same level as in the closing months of 2024. (Of course, the pricelevelis higher, contrary to Trump’s claims.) Theunemployment raterose only a little, from4.1% at the end of 2024to4.6% in November. Economic growth probably slowed toward the end of the year, but the situation remains unclear, because a US government shutdowndelayeddata collection.Nearly half of Americans believe their financial security is getting worse, poll findsRead moreIn any case, it is pretty safe to say that the economic damage caused during Trump’s first year back in office has been smaller than predicted. There are four reasons why his tariffs’ biggest effects were limited or delayed in 2025.First, US economic statistics are unusually vulnerable to measurement problems, owing to the government shutdown, which stretched from 1 October to 12 November. Some CPI information is missing because the Bureau of Labor Statistics could not collect data as usual, particularly for October. Even in November, there isreason to doubtthat housing cost inflationamounted to zero, as reported. If true, this would bias the overall CPI estimate downward. GDP releases by the Bureau of Economic Analysis are way behindschedule, with the release of third-quarter GDP data having beenpostponed.The second reason we have seen less damage from Trump’s tariffs than expected is that many of the highest ones are not fully in effect. Trump has postponed some tariffs repeatedly. Herolled backothers on 14 November, because they were driving up grocery prices.Moreover, Trump introduced major tariff exceptions for some countries. For example, the integrated North American auto industry would have been devastated if he hadn’tdecidedon 6 March to exempt goods from Mexico and Canada fromthe 25%levythat hadgone into effecttwo days earlier. Goods from these countries now face no penalty if they are imported under the US-Mexico-Canada agreement.Trump regularly stakes out extreme negotiating positions, only to back down when the heat is onThis softening was predictable. US business would have suffered enormously if Trump had fully implemented the tariffs he had announced, let alone threatened, so it was never likely that he would persist with the worst of them. Trump regularly stakes out extreme negotiating positions, only toback downwhen the heat is on, even if he hasn’t gotten what he demanded from the other side. In fact, investors’ assumption that “Trump always chickens out” – known as Taco – has become a taunt. But when a madman threatens Armageddon, it is foolhardy to goad him into following through. The tariffs Trumphasimplemented are still very high.But this does not mean economists got their predictions all wrong. There are good reasons to think that many of the adverse effects of Trump’s tariffs have simply been delayed, and we should expect them to show up in 2026.This brings us to the third point: as soon as Trump was elected in November 2024, companies beganfront-loadingimports, in order to accumulate stocks of goods –especiallygold from Switzerland and weight-loss drugs from Ireland – before the anticipated tariffs were introduced. The Penn Wharton Budget Modelestimatesthat this strategy saved US importers as much as $6.5bn (£4.8bn) – equivalent to 13.1% of the new tariff bill – through May 2025.After the tariffs entered into effect, most retailers still didn’t raise prices, as they had not depleted their pre-tariff inventories. This is common practice among retailers, though an economist might say that it violates the principle of profit maximisation. Even today, many importers have still not fully passed along the added costs to their customers.In fact – and this is the final and most important point – importers have continued to absorb much of the cost increase, even after depleting their pre-tariff inventories. Using real-time data from large US retailers, Alberto Cavallo and his co-authorsfindthat thepricesof goods subject to the new tariffs – the imported products and their US-made substitutes – have beenrisingsince April. The increase, which amounted to about 5.4% at the retail level, has been enough to raise theinflation rateon the overall CPI basket by 0.7 percentage points above where it otherwise would have been. But it represents a small fraction of the costs that could potentially be passed through, at current tariff levels.Importers have continued to absorb much of the cost increase, even after depleting their pre-tariff inventoriesTo be sure, the prices importers pay haverisen proportionatelywith tariffs, contrary to Trump’s claims that foreign exporters cover the costs of the duties by lowering their prices. It is US companies that have been absorbing the costs, much as they typically do when the dollar depreciates. This partly reflects the fact that they have no idea how long the tariffs will be in place. Trump might change his mind, or perhaps the supreme court will decide to adhere to the law and strike them down. Thisuncertaintyalso helps to explain why many affected companies have so far refrained from laying off workers.But companies will not let tariffs erode their profit margins indefinitely. Assuming the tariffs remain, the US can look forward to more price increases, and downward pressure on real incomes, in 2026.Jeffrey Frankel is a professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard University.

The Murdochs are squabbling over Fox. Jeff Bezos has remade the Washington Post in his own image. The pharmaceutical magnate Patrick Soon-Shiong places a thumb on the scale at the Los Angeles Times, and the Trump-aligned Ellison family has taken over Paramount and CBS, and spent the final weeks of this year making hostile takeover bids for CNN owner Warner Bros. The influence of these billionaire personalities has often reshaped their organizations’ newsrooms and editorial boards, directing investigations and particularly opinion sections towards ownership’s pet projects and preferred policies.On the other hand, US media organizations are also facing tremendous pressure from theTrump administration– and from Donald Trump personally, who has used a combination of frivolous defamation suits and weaponized regulatory agencies to extract vast sums from outlets that publish coverage he does not like and threaten the licenses of broadcasters who host voices critical of his movement. He extracted a vast settlement from CBS over a shockingly banal concision edit to a Kamala Harris interview on 60 Minutes; he sued the New York Times over unflattering coverage; his FCC chair threatened to withdraw ABC’s broadcast license over comments made on air by a comedian.Swayed both by the preferences of their ownership and by the threat of retaliation from Trump, some major outlets have seemed to soften their coverage. Fearful of lawsuits from displeased subjects, they hedge their bets. Unwilling to buck Washington’s Maga conventional wisdom or to displease their owners, they reshape their opinion sections. There are still many journalists of great talent and integrity at these publications, but the results have been palpable. The quality of the outlets has precipitously declined: they are putting out worse work as the costs of putting out good work become greater.Between billionaires and the Trump administration, there is another incentive that has too often been compromised: the journalistic mandate to serve readers, and to tell the truth.Would it be too selfish of me – or perhaps just a bit gauche – to admit how many times, as an American opinion journalist, I have looked at the fate of my colleagues at other outlets and thought: “Thank God I’m at the Guardian”?The Guardianhas never – and would never – ask me to pull a punch in my opinion column, or to flatter someone whose power or protection the paper needs. The Guardian does not shape its coverage, in its opinion section or in its news reporting, based on what is politically expedient or what will get them into the least trouble. The Guardian is able – and, crucially, it is willing – to challenge the powerful. Other outlets ask their writers to compromise; the Guardian has never asked this of me.This is in no small part because the Guardian has no billionaire owner. It does not need to flatter his ego, or wield its opinion section to advance the interests of his businesses. It is supported, instead, by its readers – whose financial support bankrolls our investigations, keeps the lights on in our newsrooms, and pays my rent. It is you, not a billionaire, that we answer to, and you, not a billionaire, whose interests we are tasked with serving.At the risk of sounding corny, I’ll say that I am sometimes overwhelmed by my own eagerness for this challenge. To be a progressive voice in these pages, week after week, telling you the truth as I see it, has been the greatest honor of my career. As the media continues to flounder, unsure of profit models and unsteady in their navigation of the Trump era, there are fewer and fewer places where I would be able to do this kind of work. I’m grateful for this one.**Please support the Guardian’s year-end appeal today, if you can.Thank you for protecting the truly free press.Explore more on these topicsMediaThe GuardianUS press and publishingDonald TrumpTrump administrationMedia businessPress freedomcommentShareReuse this content"

Yes, there is – and as it happens, I’m sitting on a literal hill right now, feeding them. Pigeons. Why pigeons? Because it’s about time they get the respect they deserve.I like pigeons. Because they’re like me, working class. You can tell pigeons are working class because every pigeon looks knackered. It’s about this point in the conversation that people politely make their excuses and slowly back away (literally) while avoiding eye contact. No doubt, reading this, you are doing the same (figuratively).But aren’t you just a bit curious why, out of all the birds, pigeons are the most tolerant of humans? It’s certainly not mutual. No other bird faces so much hostility from us. Spikes, netting, “do not feed” signs – all things we inflict on a bird whose greatest crime is exhibiting an impressive lack of shame when it comes to scrounging our leftovers. Pigeons eat that bit of sandwich you’ve dropped on the ground with the same energy that one friend of yours thinks carrying only their drink back from the bar is an act of service.But we’re the tolerant ones, I hear you cry. Who told them they could live alongside us so brazenly? You’re going to want to sit down for this M Night Shyamalan-esque plot twist. We did. The year is 4,500BC. As our ancestors trade the nomadic hunter-gatherer life for farming, they have the bright idea to take the pigeon’s ancestor, theColumba livia,from the cliffs they live on and build them little pigeon houses so that they couldbreed themfor food.Soon, with a nice supply of pigeon nuggets added to their diet, our forebears begin to notice other things about pigeons, such as their excellent homing abilities. Unlike us, pigeons don’t need a combination of Google Maps, road signs and backseat drivers to find their way home. In further proof of their working-class roots, they just get on with it. Incredibly, they’re able to find their way home from distances of 1,000km.You know that civilisation you think was so great, and can’t stop banging on about? It doesn’t matter which one – Roman, Greek, Ottoman, Han, Mughal – they all used pigeons to communicate across their vast territories. That’s right, the first posties were pigeons. And the service was one we can only dream of: fast, reliable, not a single “sorry we missed you” card. Before the advent of telecommunications, it was pigeon messengers that allowed our cities, worlds and lives to expand. And it’s not just ancient history but our very recent history, as well.May I present Exhibit A, the pigeon fact to end all pigeon facts. The pidge de résistance. Pigeons in this countryserved inthe second world war. You heard. Such were the existential stakes for Britain, no one batted an eyelid when thousands of pigeons joined the war effort. There was a National Pigeon Service that had more than 200,000 serving pigeons. Nazi Germany had the Luftwaffe, the largest and most technologically advanced air force at that time, and we called up birds that eat floor chips. Nowadays, it would be considered w0kE and DeI g0n£ mAd to have pigeons in the armed forces, but back then they were there on merit.Not only that, but they performed heroically, successfully carrying out missions and saving human lives. Like Mary of Exeter,a pigeon-intelligence operativewho survived a German falcon attack. The tip of her wing was blown off and shrapnel lodged in her neck. And worst of all, she then had to go back to Exeter. It won’t surprise you to know that Mary was a proper member of the pigeon proletariat, who lived above a bootmakers. After each enemy attack, did she make a fuss? No, of course not. Instead of bothering doctors with her life-threatening injuries, she opted for something far more British, to keep calm and carry on cooing.“Oh God, what can we do to make amends?” I hear you cry out hysterically. It’s very simple. You can see them. Not like how you normally do, as if they’re not there. Butreallysee them. Spend a few minutes pigeon- watching. Maybe you’ll see what our ancestors saw thousands of years ago: a bird that’s not like other birds. A bird that’s a fellow commuter on this journey of ours, just trying to get through it like the rest of us. And if you’ve got a problem with that, you can find me on a hill with 20 hard-as-nut Lewisham pigeons.Toussaint Douglass is a comedian from Lewisham, south London.

This is what most of us are trained to do as children; for some it was our first experience of being instructed to lie.“Thank you,” I might have said to my grandmother, “for this frilly, itchy lace-trimmed dress identical to the one you gave my sister. I love it.”After lying through your teeth comes the dilemma of what to do with the unwanted itchy dress/humping turtles salt and pepper shakers/patchouli-scented candle. Or the perfume that reminds you of cat urine, the vase shaped like a brick, the hat that looks like an unrolled condom. Do you regift it? Give it to the op shop? What would happen if the giver were to discover this?I was given a painting by a generous friend – painted by an artist she knew. She asked me what I thought of it and I said it was beautiful. It was – it is – but it wasn’t something I’d have chosen for myself. It wasn’t my style and I didn’t know how to say this politely.On these in-between days I’m ‘growing down’, sinking into the present moment and savouring small delights | Nadine LevyRead moreI hung it in the guest bedroom but, when I moved house and had to downsize, I took it to an op shop several suburbs away, thinking I was safe in my subterfuge. Weeks passed before I received a call from this friend.“You took the painting I gave you to Vinnies!”Turns out her artist friend lived in the suburb of the op shop I selected. Worse, he often browsed there for canvases. Upon discovering his own art he bought it back then reported his horror. I felt like digging a hole in the earth and disappearing into it.“Why didn’t you tell me you didn’t like it?” my friend asked.To salve my shame, I had to ask others about their most embarrassing gift faux pas.One friend didn’t realise that when she advertised something on Facebook Marketplace it would be visible to all of her friends and relatives. So, when she tried to sell an unwanted gift, the giver (mortifyingly) messaged her.“I’ve since changed my settings,” she said. “So that what I sell is NOT visible to my family and friends.”A writer recalled a man she knew who took it upon himself to educate his (younger) girlfriends with gifts of books. He subsequently discovered all of the Jeanette Winterson novels he had bought one ex-girlfriend in an op shop, still bearing the loving messages he had inscribed.As it turned out, Winterson’s novels had helped the ex in her realisation she was more interested in women than men.Another writer recalled her artist mother giving a painting to a specialist as a thank-you gift, and years later a stranger later contacting her mother to say they had bought the painting at an op shop in a completely different part of the state.“My mother refused to believe that it was the same painting she gave to the specialist,” the writer said. “She never accepted that it went to an op shop.”From an artist’s perspective, it might be confronting to see your work in a charity shop, but what about a council clean-up?An artist I know had a friend discover one of her paintings in someone else’s house, hung in the living room. When asked where she bought it, the woman said she’d found it on the kerb.“I wasn’t deeply offended,” the artist said. “I was more delighted that someone picked it up.”As a novelist and frequent op shopper, I have checked the shelves for my own books and discovered signed copies. Even, once, a signed copy dedicated to someone I know.Was I horrified? No, because I’ve given away author-inscribed books as well. There isn’t room on my shelves for all of them.Is it Twixmas or Twixtmas? And other style guide conundrums we have faced this year at the Guardian | Charlotte Naughton and Katy GuestRead morePerhaps creators should be pleased their works are finding new homes. They’re not hiding away in attics or garages, or even worse: bins.The artist recommends honesty as the best policy when you receive a work of art you do not like.“Tell the giver it’s not your style. Say, ‘I would not appreciate it as much as I should.’“Art is personal and we only have so much wall space, you’ve really got to love what you put up.”But what if you have tried courage and failed, and you still have an unwanted piece of art, hand-knitted puce jumper or inscribed book?I’m reminded of the story of an international author who visited Australia and could not fit all the dedicated, signed copies of books she was given into her suitcase. Before flying home, she turned to someone she was with and passed her the books.“I’m going to need you to eat these,” she said.Eleanor Limprecht is the author ofWhat Was Left,Long Bay,The PassengersandThe Coast.

The golden age of discovery is over and the way we develop and use drugs needs to changeMon 29 Dec 2025 13.30 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 13.33 ESTShareDuring her tenure as director general of the World Health Organization,Dr Margaret Chanused to say that all of the “easy” antibiotics had already been found. Her point was that in responding to the urgent threat of antibiotic-resistant infections, we would struggle to find new medicines – or preserve the ones we have – if we didn’t find new ways of working. She was right.Since 2017, just 16 antibiotics havegained widespread regulatory approval– mostly close relatives of medicines already in use and so unlikely to evade resistance for long. The development of new ones is a slow and unprofitable business, curative medicines being less lucrative than ones treating longer-term conditions. And the scientific outlook remains bleak.Nevertheless, the announcement this month oftwo new US Food and Drug Administration-approved antibioticsagainst gonorrhoea is good news and, crucially, validates a new way of incentivising research. One of the new drugs, Zoliflodacin, is the product of a novel kind of partnership between the Swiss non‑profit Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP) and the pharmaceutical company Innoviva. GARDP provided funding and organised clinical trials to defray costs and clear regulatory hurdles. Such assistance upfront helps direct the industry towards areas of greatest global need.This approach and the UK government’s lauded“subscription model”– launched in 2022 to guarantee revenue to companies that invested in certain antibiotics – represent the best hope of maintaining a dripfeed of new drugs out of the current system.But even hurrying the production of drugs that are currently in development isn’t enough. Zoliflodacin is sometimes described as a new class of antibiotics, meaning one that targets a part of the infectious bacteria that no other drug does, theoretically forcing the pathogen to start from zero in evolving a countermeasure to it. Scientists and doctors are relieved to have a new drug for gonorrhoea – which has resistant strains against every known antibiotic – but caution that future resistance to Zoliflodacin is inevitable.As has become the norm with new antibiotics,there is therefore an argumentabout whether it should be held in reserve, rationed to highly resistant infections only – limiting its use to where high‑end lab testing is available. This sort of rational approach should be the worldwide norm, but often can’t be deployed easily in the global south.More broadly, it is hard to see where the stream of other new antibiotics we need could possibly come from. Dr Chan’s comment nodded to the fact that surveying the living world for natural sources – as with penicillin – has had diminishing returns. Use of artificial intelligence has been mooted to speed up the discovery process, although a much-celebrated early candidate called halicin, identified in 2020, hasn’t yet progressed past animal trials. Synthetic drugs, which are mainly or fully lab-created, are constantly in development, but often run up against the iron laws of chemistry – just because we imagine a molecule doesn’t mean we can synthesise it easily.The prevailing scientific evaluation is that when it comes to antibiotics, we must run very fast indeed just to stay in the same place. Careful internationally coordinated use is the only way to preserve our advantage. Sadly, the scale of future breakthroughs is going to seem miserly compared with the curative bonanza of the 20th century.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

To this end, next year has been decreed theNational Year of Reading 2026. It couldn’t be more timely.Reading is in crisis. Picking up a book for pleasure among children and young people in the UK is at its lowest level in 20 years. According to theNational Literacy Trust, only one in three eight- to 18-year‑olds enjoy reading in their spare time – a 36% drop in two decades. The decline is worst among teenage boys and the poorest children.A quarter of pupilsleft primary school in England this year without adequate reading skills. All of this should be no surprise given thathalf of adultsin the UK don’t read regularly themselves andresearch showsthat many parents don’t enjoy reading to their children.Reading, like storytelling itself, is a gift handed from generation to generation. If the link breaks, we risk losing the skills altogether. This is where initiatives like the National Year of Reading 2026 – which will distribute 72,000 new books to children with the greatest need for them – come in.The firstChildren’s Booker prize, aimed at readers aged eight to 12, will be launched in 2026 and awarded annually from 2027. The inaugural award will be chaired by thechildren’s laureate Frank Cottrell‑Boyceand include young judges on the panel. The shortlisted and winning titles will be given to thousands of children. Aiming even younger, theCultural Policy Unitthinktank is calling for library cards to be automatically issued to all newborn babies.A child’s first1,000 daysare vital: shared reading is key to cognitive and emotional development. It is not just a question of literacy, but ofbonding and attachment. This can be a magical time at the end of the day when child and adult come together “and the walls [become] the world all around”, asMaurice Sendak’s classic picture book has it. This is how we learn. And nothing on a screen can replicate these benefits.That a quarter of three- and four-year-olds in the UK now own a smartphone, and half of under-13s are on social media, is clearly a big part of the problem. But it is not the whole story. Child poverty is at arecord high. Austerity has forced local libraries to close. Long working hours, solo parenting, health issues or different-aged siblings can make a bedtime story seem an impossible hurdle for parents. For too many, books are unaffordable and inaccessible.Any initiative to foster new readers is a cause for celebration. But warm words must be backed up with action and funding. Free books and library cards for babies are useless without adult readers and well-resourced libraries. Rachel Reeveshas promisedto ensure that every primary school has a library. This should be a given, along with trained librarians, less overstretched teachers, improved provision for children with special educational needs and support for new parents and babies.As Margaret Atwood writes in her poemSpelling: “A word after a word after a word is power.” We owe it to children to give them this power. Make a new year resolution to read more: to yourself, to a friend, to a child.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromMike ScottandGerry ReesMon 29 Dec 2025 12.45 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 12.52 ESTShare“When the AI bubble bursts, humans will finally have their chance to take back control”, says the headline on Rafael Behr’s article (23 December). I think it’s more likely that when the AI bubble bursts, the creators of the crisis, along with other wealthy economic actors, will be in the rooms with the politicians telling them how to “rescue” us all by transferring wealth in some way from average citizens to the already extremely wealthy. Just like they did during the financial crisis of 2008.We need to be ready with alternative plans. For example, world governments could coordinate to buy, for suitably low prices, majority shares in any crashing tech company that actually produces something useful, ensuring that those shares come with full voting rights.Governments could then, acting as majority shareholders, instruct these monopolies to divide themselves back into national companies, paying local rates of taxation in one single country for all their activities and obeying all local content and copyright laws.Governments could spend money on infrastructure and wages in any area of these companies that is actually useful and sell the shares for a profit once they are making money again.That’s just one idea. Another might be that we just shut them all down and conserve our power and water for human beings, and close down or refuse to build the datacentres. We should be generating lots of ideas so that, when the time comes, nobody can say “there is no alternative” to the plans that will be proposed behind closed doors by the super-rich and then presented to the rest of us as a fait accompli.Anyone with thoughts on this matter needs to make it clear, as a matter of urgency, that there are plenty of possible plans that don’t just transfer more wealth to the super-rich.Anja CraddenEdinburghRafael Behr is right to be concerned about the rapid development of AI, but he seems to be suggesting that we all just wait until the bubble bursts before taking any action to control it. Apart from the potentially catastrophic impact on jobs, the sort of issues raised by an article you published earlier this month (‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI, 1 December) mean that we can’t assume we’ll get the chance.In the foreseeable future, AI will certainly be able to sabotage attempts to close down or redirect it, and by then it will be too late. Insiders are already worrying that AI could herald the end of the road for humanity, and we must begin the fight to control it now, before it begins to control us.Mike ScottNottinghamReading Rafael Behr’s piece on AI reminded me of a short story by the American author Fredric Brown. Scientists build a supercomputer and ask it the final question: “Is there a God?

She played a cabaret performer stranded on a cargo ship who is first discovered by Bogarde, as Dr Simon Sparrow, taking a shower.As I recounted in my 1987 book, The Golden Gong, filming was, with characteristic British modesty, to take place from the other side of the shower curtain, with Bardot’s body covered. However, as the producerBetty Boxexplained to me, the camera was able to pick out the outline of the garments which, frankly, looked foolish.Bardot came to the rescue. She stripped off before an agog crew. Word whizzed round Pinewood Studios and often the sound stage was bulging at the seams.Box would later recall in her own memoir that Bardot was “a joy to work with” and that her “fractured English charmed everyone”.Explore more on these topicsBrigitte BardotlettersShareReuse this content"

This is much more important than symbolic firewalls and grandiose declarations.And one more thing: just as National Socialism drew its momentum in the early 1930s from the fear of large sections of the population of big business on the one hand and Bolshevism on the other, today the combined fear of the global financial elite on the one hand and the ecologically necessary but ideologically condemned ecological restructuring on the other is fuelling the rise of rightwing authoritarianism.Dr Jens HolstBerlinTania Roettger’s reflection provides a necessary historical baseline, but it risks leaving us intellectually unarmed against the Fascism 2.0 movement’s 21st-century evolution. By searching for 1930s markers, specifically uniformed paramilitaries and explicit biological racism – we miss the “administrative fascism” currently taking root in western democracies.The primary disconnect lies in the target and the terminology. Historical fascism (Fascism 1.0) was obsessed with ethnic purity based on 20th-century race science. Today’s far right has pivoted to “civilisational exclusion”. In a post-9/11 landscape, Islamophobia has become the functional equivalent of the antisemitism of the 1930s. By framing exclusion as a defence of “western values” against an “unassimilable” global south, modern movements practice racialisation without using the word “race”, making their ideology palatable to a liberal mainstream.Crucially, we must recognise that targeted hate begets indiscriminate hate. When the state normalises the exclusion of one group, it erodes the legal and moral guardrails that protect all citizens. The requirement for a “paramilitary force” is now an anachronism; modern fascism weaponises the security state itself. From militarised border regimes to bureaucratic “remigration” plans, violence has become legalised and procedural.Modern fascists no longer lead with “superiority” but with “siege”. By weaponising grievances over “wokeness” and “demographic replacement”, they frame authoritarianism as a defensive necessity. If we only look for the ghosts of 1945, we will remain blind to the fascism of 2025 and beyond. To stop this tide, we must address the functional reality of their agenda: the demonisation of the global south and the slow, administrative erosion of universal human dignity and rights.Ahmed DirieSan Jose, California, USClearly, the most eye-catching focus when monitoring and guarding against the growth of fascism is a separate party or movement with a set of explicit policies – including those outlined by Tania Roettger.But in the current climate, inEuropeand beyond, we should be equally wary of the roles both of the state itself and of dominant media. In the UK we can see, for example, a creeping heavy-handedness in policing and the use of designations of “terrorism” as a tool of state oppression. This is already reminiscent of fascism’s warping of the rule of law.Meanwhile, popular media already mimics the worst excesses of 20th-century totalitarian propaganda by glossing over, ignoring and distracting from these abuses, while also giving a free pass to those on the far right. It is this convergence of interests, rather than “just” a specific and separate anti-democratic party, which gives cause for real concern.Paul GanderLondonExplore more on these topicsGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)NazismThe far rightEuropeCost of living crisisInequalitylettersShareReuse this content"

To have two England teams – in two of our most loved sports – win major tournaments in the space of a few months was just extraordinary.”Wiegman, who has overseen England’s run to three consecutive major finals, said: “I would like to express my sincere gratitude for this honour. When I first arrived in England, I could never have imagined the respect and warmth I’ve experienced from the English people.” As a Dutchwoman, Wiegman is ineligible for the title of dame, hence the honorary nature of her award.Debbie Hewiit, the Football Association’s chair, said Wiegman has “captured the hearts of the English public”, adding: “We feel incredibly privileged to have not only the world’s leading head coach, but also an exceptional leader – someone who leads with integrity, humility, and a deep belief in human connection.”The broadcaster Gabby Logan and the former world and European marathon champion Paula Radcliffe, both already MBEs, were made OBEs, as was the commentator Clive Tyldesley, for services to broadcasting and charity.View image in fullscreenJayne Torvill and Christopher Dean have been recognised in the new year honours list.Photograph: PAThere is also recognition for the off-pitch efforts that contributed to England hosting a successful Rugby World Cup. Sarah Massey, the tournament’s managing director, is made an MBE, and the chair of the board of directors, Gill Whitehead, an OBE.Aldcroft, who lifted the trophy after September’s win over Canada, said: “As Red Roses, our aim is always to inspire. We hope we will continue to do so in 2026 and make people all over the country incredibly proud.”Perhaps surprisingly, the Lionesses trio of Chloe Kelly, Hannah Hampton and Michelle Agyemang have all been omitted from this year’s list despite widespread acclaim for their performances last summer, along with Alessia Russo, who scored England’s goal in the final against Spain.Lucy Bronze reveals she played with fractured tibia throughout Euro 2025Read moreDr Ritan Mehta, the Lionesses’ head of medical, is made an MBE for services to football, having worked with the team for 11 years, while that honour also goes to the former England player Kerry Davis for services to football and diversity in sport. In 1982, she became England’s first black female international player. She scored 44 times for England and Wiegman added: “I’d also like to congratulate Kerry – she is a Lionesses’ legend and the women’s game would not be where it is today without her, and the contribution of so many former players. We have a lot to thank her for.”Stanway, who helped Bayern Munich win two major trophies in 2025 as well as being a key player for the Lionesses in Switzerland, said of her honour: “Receiving an MBE is a real ‘pinch me’ moment. After all, I am just a girl from Barrow. I love my country and I’ll fly the flag wherever life takes me. To be awarded an MBE is such a huge honour so thank you and dream big!”The former executive chair of Tottenham Daniel Levy and the former Celtic chief executive Fergus McCann have been made CBEs. The former Celtic defender Jim Craig, who was part of their 1967 Lisbon Lions who won the European Cup, is an OBE while the tennis umpire James Keothavong becomes an MBE along with the broadcaster and former England cricketer Isa Guha.Explore more on these topicsSportWomen's footballWomen's rugby unionRugby unionNew year honours listSarina WiegmanLeah WilliamsonnewsShareReuse this content"

At some point it must stop – but not yetJonathan WilsonMon 29 Dec 2025 16.52 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 18.17 ESTShareIt can’t go on. It makes no sense that it goes on. And yet it goes on.Aston Villa went into Saturday’s Premier Leage game at Chelsea having won 10 games in a row, looking to match a record set in 1897 and 1914. For an hour there seemed no chance they would achieve it, as Chelsea outplayed them, took the lead and could have had several more. But Chelsea are vulnerable with a lead, especially at home, and Villa have developed a baffling habit of winning away games having gone behind.First Ollie Watkins equalised, the ball cannoning in off his shin and the post after he’d been set clean through and his initial effort blocked by Robert Sánchez. Then he got the winner with a deft header, just the fourth and fifth league goals he’s scored this season. Watkins perhaps would feel he is due some luck, but there is no doubting the first goal was fortunate. At the moment, though, luck is favouring Villa.The last nine of those 11 wins in a row have been by a single goal. They’ve kept a clean sheet in only one of them. They’ve had the better xG in only six of those games and in two of those their xG was better by 0.2 or less. Their last five away Premier League games have been won after going behind. This shouldn’t be sustainable, but everybody’s been saying that for weeks and Villa keep on winning. The question is whether results will decline to match performances or whether performances could rise to match results.Coming from behind is not just a trait of this season. Over the past three seasons no side has won more points from losing positions than Villa’s 54; 18 of those have come this season, 50% more than the team second in that list, Sunderland. This season, Villa substitutes have scored nine goals. Two things can perhaps be said of Villa under Unai Emery. Firstly, that they have a self-belief that means there is never a sense that a game is beyond them. That is, to an extent, self-perpetuating: the more they come from behind, the more they believe they can come from behind.And secondly, that Emery is very adept at changing games from the bench. While Chelsea had the better of the xG 2.1-1.4, Villa were dominant from the moment just before the hour when Emery made a triple change. Watkins came on for Donyell Malen who, with limited service, had struggled to impose himself. Suddenly the ball was sticking, while Watkins’s movement behind the defensive line cause problems. Amadou Onana came on for Emi Buendía and Jadon Sancho came on for John McGinn. That both strengthened Villa’s centre by advancing Youri Tielemans, which in turn released Morgan Rogers, and gave them the width they had eschewed early on.Chelsea had 10 shots to none before that change; Villa had 11 chances to four afterwards. By the end, Villa were in control and could easily have won more comfortably. Not for the first time this season, Enzo Maresca was unable to react as a game started to slide away from him; the impression remains that he is better at putting together a tactical plan when he has time to prepare than when reacting on the hoof.Villa have also developed a happy habit of having players suddenly do something sensational to turn games. Rogers scored twice at Leeds and at West Ham and also got two at home against Manchester United. The sight of him working the ball onto his right foot and whipping a finish into the top corner has become a leitmotif for the season. It was Malen operating from the flank who turned the game after coming on at half-time at Leeds. Watkins changed the game at Stamford Bridge. The contribution of Ezri Konsa and Victor Lindelöf on Saturday, particularly in the first half, should not be overlooked. At the moment, it’s never the whole tea playing brilliantly, but sufficient individuals within it to get them the wins.Can they keep going? They’re three points behind Arsenal and, on that logic, as the season approaches its halfway point they have to be considered part of the race, certainly more than the club world champions Chelsea or the defending champions Liverpool. Tuesday’s away game at Arsenal will be a major test of that. Villa beat Arsenal on the first weekend of December, a game in which Villa didn’t only have the better xG but registered an xG 40% higher than any other side had achieved against Arsenal in the league this season.Arsenal have put together their own run of single-goal victories since, winning three in a row without ever being entirely convincing. Tuesday will be a test of both sides – and if Villa win a 12th game in a row, it would become almost impossible to deny their title credentials.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Leicester are four points off the playoff zone going into Thursday’s visit to Sheffield United but there are still plans for fans to boycott next Monday’s televised game with West Brom.Cifuentes praised the fans’ vocal encouragement on the night – “That’s the kind of atmosphere I love,” he said. “The fans were very helpful for us and I’m pleased for them” – but it is fragile.Coventry 0-2 Ipswich, Middlesbrough 0-1 Hull and more: Football League – liveRead moreIt took until the 15th minute for the home fans to start chanting “sack the board” and calling for the technical director, Jon Rudkin, to go, by which stage both teams had scored. There were also banners, one demanding “King Power out”. By the time James gave Leicester the lead four minutes before the interval, the home crowd barely knew whether to cheer or jeer.Scrooge would have struggled to make a worse job of managing staff morale at Christmas than Leicester. Non-player wages were due to be paid on 19 December before an email from the interim managing director, Kamonthip Netthanomsak, “regrettably” informed staff they were being deferred until New Year’s Eve. The atmosphere at the Christmas party was said to be foul. The chair, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, has not missed at least three recent home games so his pleas for club and fans to come together have not gone down well.They have shown they can win big games – such as against Ipswich, and at Pride Park three weeks ago – but then lose twice to drop back into mid-table. So it is not surprising home supporters’ spirits oscillate more than a chocolate-giddy child halfway through the Christmas holidays.They were up when De Cordova-Reid sidefooted home in the sixth minute, after the bright spark Abdul Fatawu beat Callum Elder to cross from the right wing; and down again when Brewster converted Elder’s cross from the left after good work from Patrick Agyemang.View image in fullscreenRhian Brewster scored his first goal since August to equalise for Derby.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PALeicester still have a sprinkling of Premier League quality, demonstrated when Stephy Madividi invited Oliver Skipp to punch in a first-time pass for Luke Thomas to control, spin and volley wide. But Cifuentes, who succeeded Ruud van Nistelrooy in the summer, claims to still be working through inherited problems, and that is before a potential points deduction kicks in for spending breaches from two years ago.Quick GuideChampionship roundupShowYang Min-hyeok scored a last-gasp winner to givePortsmoutha vital 2-1 win overCharltonand lift them out of the relegation zone. Harvey Knibbs headed in an equaliser in the last minute of additional time after Conor Shaughnessy had given Pompey the lead. But Portsmouth went straight up the other end and caused euphoria right around the ground as Tottenham loanee Yang struck a devastating blow to Nathan Jones' side.Sheffield Unitedmoved seven points clear of the relegation zone after claiming a 2-1 win away atStoke. Second-half goals from Jairo Riedewald and Tom Cannon secured all three points for Chris Wilder's side. Ben Wilmot halved the deficit with 25 minutes remaining but Stoke, who lost Ben Pearson to an 88th-minute red card, were unable to find an equaliser and  have now failed to register a win in six out of their last seven matches.A 90th-minute winner from the substitute Vivaldo Semedo earned in-formWatforda hard-fought 1-0 victory overNorwichat Carrow Road whileSheffield Wednesday's winless run stretched to 17 games with a goalless draw atBlackburn.Wrexhammoved to within four points of the playoff places with a 2-1 win overPreston. Nathan Broadhead (pictured) nodded them in front in the 28th minute before the substitute Ollie Rathbone doubled their lead 12 minutes from time, with Alfie Devine's late consolation not enough to stop Phil Parkinson's men making it back-to-back wins in the league for the first time this season.Macaulay Langstaff's first goal since the opening day of the season gaveMillwalla 2-1 victory overBristol Citythat moved them back into the   playoff positions. Adam Randell cancelled out Camiel Neghli's opening goal but Langstaff won it with nine minutes remaining.Set-piece headers from the defenders George Campbell and Nat Phillips gaveWest Broma welcome 2-1 home win overQPR. Ousmane Diakité's 35th-minute own goal pegged West Brom back until Phillips restored their lead 10 minutes after the break.Zan Vipotnik scored his 12th goal of the season forSwanseaas they completed a double over managerlessOxfordwith a 1-0 win at the Kassam Stadium. The Slovenia international powerfully headed in Josh Tymon's left-wing cross in the 14th minute.Darko Gyabi's clinical first-half strike enabledHullto turn the tables with a 1-0 win overMiddlesbroughat the Riverside Stadium – less than a month after being hammered 4-1 at Hull's MKM Stadium.Cameron Archer sealed a point in a 1-1 draw forSouthamptonafter Phil Neumann's header had looked to putBirminghamon course for a first win since  1 December.PA MediaPhotograph: Cody Froggatt/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.James, on loan from Rennes, looks among Leicester’s best players and scored his seventh league goal of the season when he ran on to Thomas’s pass, nonchalantly shrugged off Liam Thompson and steered the ball past Jacob Zetterström. “JJ is very important for us,” Cifuentes said, indicating Rennes are not due to recall him. “He wants to keep improving and we have a plan for him as a club.”Derby went four games unbeaten in between these defeats by Leicester. They are doughty under John Eustace, and look far more resilient than when fighting relegation this time last year. They had won five successive games before losing the 10-goal Carlton Morris to an ankle injury that has ruled him out until February.They are missing him, even if Brewster, Agyemang, Lars-Jørgen Salvesen and Ben Brereton-Díaz offer plenty of contrasting attacking potential. Eustace said: “In that final third we need to show a bit more quality and belief, to want to put our head in where it hurts. We put plenty of good crosses in but we need to get on the end of them. It’s frustrating because we felt we could come here and win. But you can’t fault their effort.”Hamza Choudhury and Aaron Ramsey – who went off with a recurrence of a hamstring injury four minutes after coming on as a substitute – joined the list of midfield players ruled out for Leicester. Already missing is Boubakary Soumaré, with Harry Winks seemingly on his way out of the club. But they finished the game in control, with Zetterström, the Derby goalkeeper, spectacularly tipping over a headed intervention from Ebou Adams, his own captain.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipLeicester CityDerby Countymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Maybe that upbringing bred his ability to fit in, find a way to communicate and always be of one’s place, regardless of where that place may be.Afterwinning the County Championshipwith Sussex in 2003, Moores was appointed coach of the England men’s team. Like pretty much all of his predecessors, his reign ended in failure, precipitated by a falling out with Kevin Pietersen (I guess that slips comfortably into the “it happens” category).Dusting himself down, he went to Lancashire and, in 2011, delivered a first outright Championship to Old Trafford in 77 years. That secured another crack with England, but, not much more than a year after taking the job, the ECB handed him his sandwiches wrapped in a road map once again.Twenty-two years on from that win on the south coast, he was opening the champagne once again, for an unprecedented title with a third county, this time withNottinghamshire. It is an extraordinary feat of coaching to inspire players in environments so radically different as that of English first-class cricket in 2003 and in 2025.View image in fullscreenNottinghamshire captain Haseeb Hameed and coach Peter Moores show off the County Championship trophy.Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty ImagesNo doubt he was helped hugely by a man who has also felt the sting of failure but has subsequently navigated his way to redemption. Haseeb Hameed, like his boss, was twice tried by England and twice rejected, and even had time to lose his way at domestic level before recovering his form gloriously. And all by the age of 28.Thecaptain and coachcan look one another in the eye and see each other’s pain and joy, know that the game can give and take with capricious cruelty, but also know that “never” is a word that should not really have a place in a cricketer’s vocabulary. Next year, they can also look at the Championship pennant flying high in Nottingham.Mohammed Siraj sensational in south LondonA grey morning in south London, the warmth of summer still there but a portent of autumn in the dull light underlining the fact that we were seeing the last Test cricket of a wonderful summer, disgracefully shortened so the blazers could start counting their money before August was even five days old.The series was still in the balance after 24 days of struggle, the equation seemingly simple: England needed 35 runs; India needed four wickets. But Chris Woakes was sitting in the pavilion, his arm in a sling, and clouds threatened rain at any moment. A big crowd, with plenty of support for both teams, sat on the edge of their seats.Woakes was to provide one of the images of the year as he walked to the wicket about as gingerly as it is possible to walk. The nicest guy was the toughest guy too. But the day was not to belong to Birmingham’s sweetest export since Dairy Milk; the spoils fell to another lionheart, India’s Mohammed Siraj.View image in fullscreenMohammed Siraj celebrates after he bowls Gus Atkinson for the final wicket to give India victory against England.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBreathing fire, inspiring teammates and supporters at the ground and at home, he gave his absolute all at the end of a cruelly scheduled five-match series in which he had bowled the most overs and taken the most wickets. Had he not raised such furies, the series would surely have ended 3-1 to England and not 2-2,the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy shared.He betrayed his humble origins in the post-match interviews, the rickshaw driver’s son from Hyderabad lacking his captain’s polished speeches, instead excitedly switching between his native tongue and broken English in trying, and failing, to describe his reaction after a gladiatorial hour’s play. Viewers may not have understood all he said but it didn’t matter. We understood his heart and his soul – and that’s why we love the game.Temba Bavuma sees a ball – and a legacyThe match lay in the balance. India had fought to a first-innings lead of 30 (worth 130 on a treacherous Eden Gardens pitch). South Africa’s captain had batted for more than three hours undefeated for 55, willing his team to a just about competitive target of 124 for India’s stellar batting lineup to chase down. Even without their captain, Shubman Gill, they surely had enough power to take that off an attack led by a 36-year-old off-spinner more used to Chelmsford than Kolkata.But it wasn’tSimon Harmer bowlingwhen Temba Bavuma’s moment – a long, long moment – arrived. Axar Patel was winning the match for India: 4, 6, 0, 6 had reduced the target to 31, or about 10 more minutes of mayhem. Keshev Maharaj, another underrated but experienced spinner, was under the pump but kept his nerve; Patel kept swinging; and South Africa fans kept breathing.The ball swirled into a bright sky. Bavuma was running back towards the boundary, the whole field behind him. Looking over his shoulder, the red sphere must have appeared smaller and smaller, darker and darker, higher and higher, as the match, the series, perhaps his legacy after a bit of harrumphing about the World Test Championship qualification criteria, hung interminably in the thick air. He caught it.View image in fullscreenSouth Africa captain Temba Bavuma will surely be crowned cricketer of the year.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianI wasn’t alone in thinking instantly of Kapil Dev’slegendary catchto dismiss Viv Richards at Lord’s in the 1983 World Cup final, a shot that was heard around the world and changed the history of cricket. Bavuma’s coolest of pouches won’t do that, but it did win the Test and did set upSouth Africa’s magnificent 2-0 win in India.It should also secure Bavuma the accolade of leading men’s cricketer in the world come the 2026 Wisden Almanack. Eleven years on from his Test match debut, he is playing the best cricket of his life.This article is fromThe 99.94 Cricket BlogExplore more on these topicsCricketGuardian Sport NetworkCounty ChampionshipEngland cricket teamNottinghamshireIndia cricket teamPeter MooresSouth Africa cricket teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sent off at 4-9, the five-year-old made all the running under Harry Cobden and needed little encouragement to maintain a one-and-a-quarter length lead to the line.Affordale Fury holds off Cheltenham Gold Cup and Aintree winners to take Savills ChaseRead more“Someone just said to me, how does he compare with your other Challow winners, like Denman and Bravemansgame and all those,” Nicholls said, “and he compares with all of them. In three runs over hurdles, he’s won two Grade Twos and a Grade One, and none of them achieved that.“To back it up after three weeks [from his last win at Sandown] is not ideal [but] we wanted to give him a nice bit of time before Cheltenham rather than go to Trials day [in late January] and it’s worked out beautiful, so we’ll go straight to the festival. I’d say that will be his last run over hurdles if that goes right, then we’ll go chasing.”No Drama This End was already the favourite for the Turners Novice Hurdle over two miles and five furlongs at Cheltenham in March before Monday’s race, and was cut to a top price of 4-1 to go one place better than Denman, the runner-up in 2006, and give Nicholls his first ever victory in the race.Classy novice hurdlers with the potential to be better still over fences are just what Nicholls needs as he tries to build back towards his former dominance and he will have taken particular pleasure from the success of Minella Yoga’s defeat of Act of Innocence, the 2-7 favourite, in the card’s Introductory Hurdle.View image in fullscreenOld Cowboy (centre, No 5) on his way to winning the Coral Racing Club ‘Join For Free’ Handicap Chase at Newbury.Photograph: David Davies/PAThe result had added significance for Nicholls as Act Of Innocence was among several horses switched away from his stable over the summer by his owners, Gordon and Su Hall, while Minella Yoga’s owner, Michael Geoghegan, has been a significant recent investor in Nicholls’s Ditcheat operation.“As you can imagine, I loved that, absolutely delighted,” Nicholls said. “He’s a very nice youngster and I obviously felt I had half a chance by running him against Act Of Innocence, and I couldn’t have had a better result, to be honest.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowHaydock12.35 Nazare 1.05 Wolf Walker 1.35 Ned Tanner 2.05 Sole Solution 2.35 Majordomo 3.05 Jupiter Des Bordes (nb) 3.40 Brentford HopeTaunton12.50 Innamorato 1.20 Le Beau Madrik 1.50 Fat Faced Columbo 2.20 Al Fonce 2.50 Square Du Roule 3.23 Faitque De L’Isle 3.55 Inferno SacreeWolverhampton4.30 Gifted Angel 5.00 Mister Moet 5.30 Havana Rum 6.00 Seeing Stars 6.30 Jamie Sommers 7.00 Credit Forgedd It 7.30 Ghaiyyath Park (nap) 8.00 Bownder 8.30 Son Of AstarWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“He’s one of the nicest youngsters we have and it’s great for Michael, who has heavily invested and bought a few nice horses with me lately.”Minella Yoga was cut to around 16-1 for the Triumph Hurdle at Cheltenham in March, and could take in the track’s trial for the juvenile hurdling championship on 24 January on the way to the festival.“He’ll definitely have an entry for the Triumph and I wouldn’t be afraid of running him in it,” Nicholls said.“You could definitely see him galloping up that Cheltenham hill OK. It won’t be the be-all and end-all though, and … ultimately, he’ll be a really nice horse in the future.”Explore more on these topicsHorse racingPaul NichollsHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

That is central to Britain’s commitment to religious and political freedom. It doesn’t change the fact that we have condemned the nature of these historic tweets and we consider them to be abhorrent.”In one resurfaced tweet from 2010, Abd el-Fattah said he considered “killing any colonialists and specially Zionists heroic, we need to kill more of them”. In 2012 he posted: “I am a racist, I don’t like white people.” He is also accused of saying police did not have rights and “we should kill them all”, and referring to the British as “dogs and monkeys”.View image in fullscreenLaila Soueif protests against her son’s detention in Egypt, outside Downing Street in January.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersDowning Street said Starmer had not been aware of the past tweets until after Abd el-Fattah entered the UK. The development raises questions about what vetting took place before Abd el-Fattah was granted UK citizenship in 2021 and what research the government carried out before it took up his case with the Egyptian authorities. Successive prime ministers including Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have campaigned for his release.Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, wrote to MPs on Monday night to say the case had been “an unacceptable failure” and that due diligence procedures had been “completely inadequate for this situation”.In a letter to the foreign affairs select committee, Cooper said she had asked the Foreign Office’s top civil servant “to review the serious information failures in this case” and the systems in place for high-profile consular cases.Government sources indicated Abd el-Fattah was eligible for British citizenship through his mother without having to undergo character checks, and that case law suggested there was no grounds for removing his citizenship.The Conservatives and Reform UK have both suggested the activist should be deported from the UK for the posts and have his British citizenship revoked, even though the law does not appear to provide grounds for either action.Other MPs have condemned Abd el-Fattah’s past posts but called for a more measured response.Emily Thornberry, the Labour chair of the foreign affairs committee, said: “For those of us who campaigned for his release, it is extremely disappointing to see these tweets and they cannot be condoned in any way. That doesn’t mean, however, that it would be right to take away his nationality and send him back to Egypt, where we can see that in a period of 10 years he spent most of the time in jail just for campaigning for human rights and democracy.“If his apology today is heartfelt and genuine then he won’t need reminding of this, but it is against the law to incite religious hatred and violence, and he needs to stay within the law in the UK.”John McDonnell, the Labour MP for Hayes and Harlington, said Abd el-Fattah had been “a furious young man, angry at the brutality of what he saw around him, especially the plight of the Palestinians”.He added: “His appalling social media interventions were the product of that anger and had been exposed over a decade ago. But that’s the point: Alaa’s journey was from someone who could send these vile tweets to becoming an advocate for dignity, respect and human rights for all, a defender of the oppressed and persecuted no matter what their religion, gender or sexuality.”Abd el-Fattah citizenship row shows shift on questions of national identityRead moreIn an apology issued on Monday, Abd el-Fattah said he understood “how shocking and hurtful” his previous comments were but that some had been misconstrued.“They were mostly expressions of a young man’s anger and frustrations in a time of regional crises (the wars on Iraq, on Lebanon and Gaza), and the rise of police brutality against Egyptian youth,” he said. “I particularly regret some that were written as part of online insult battles with the total disregard for how they read to other people. I should have known better.”He stressed that he took “accusations of antisemitism very seriously”, adding: “I have always believed that sectarianism and racism are the most sinister and dangerous of forces, and I did my part and paid the price for standing up for the rights of religious minorities in Egypt.”Dan Dolan, the deputy executive director of the human rights organisation Reprieve, said: “Suggesting that someone should be stripped of citizenship for something they posted on social media, however bad, is authoritarian overreach of the worst kind and a deeply dangerous step. In a country governed by the rule of law, politicians should not have the power to strip the legal rights of whomever they choose.”Abd el-Fattah was a prominent voice in Egypt’s 2011 Arab spring uprising and went on hunger strikes behind bars. In 2014, his posts on Twitter cost him a nomination for the European parliament’s Sakharov prize.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsKeir StarmerEmily ThornberryJohn McDonnellLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The US director Jim Jarmusch told France Inter radio on Friday that he also plans to apply for French nationality.“I would like a place that will allow me to escape from the United States,” he said, adding that he was also drawn to French culture.Explore more on these topicsGeorge ClooneyAmal ClooneyFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

NowClaudia Winklemanis taking up residence in one of television’s most traditional settings – on the chatshow sofa.TheBBChas confirmed that the presenter, who has become one of its most prized assets after fronting two of its most successful programmes, is to host The Claudia Winkleman Show in the spring.The corporation will be throwing resources at the programme to ensure her new platform has the biggest names for its launch.“I can’t quite believe it and I’m incredibly grateful to the BBC for this amazing opportunity,” Winkleman said. “I’m obviously going to be awful, that goes without saying, but I’m over the moon they’re letting me try.”The announcement confirms Winkleman’s status as one of the corporation’s biggest names, after her long stint on Strictly Come Dancing and the runaway success of Celebrity Traitors this year. Winkleman’s demeanour, balancing the tension and absurdity of the latter show, is seen as a crucial part of its success.The move will also ward off attempts by other broadcasters to poach Winkleman, who has become one of primetime television’s hottest properties.Celebrity Traitors was thesmash hit of the year. Its live audience was more than 11 million, the biggest since the Gavin & Stacey special on Christmas Day 2024.Strictly Come Dancing, which she presented alongside Tess Daly, remains one of television’s most popular formats despite being hit withallegations of bullyingand anarrest of a star.The joint announcement by Winkleman and Daly in October that they werequitting the showimmediately led to speculation that the BBC was lining up a new format for the Traitors presenter.While it confirms her pre-eminent status in TV’s pecking order, there are risks in the talkshow format. Earlier in her career, S Club 7’s publicisthalted an interviewwith her on Liquid News, the BBC’s former celebrity news show.Talkshows fronted by other presenters on a ratings hot streak have not always worked. Davina McCall, whose chatshow struggled in a primetime slot in 2006, has since said sheregretted making itin the format that eventually appeared.The TV chatshow has lost viewers in the face of increased opposition and the arrival of digital platforms such as YouTube, but it still has an important place in the BBC’s schedules.The broadcaster hosts The Graham Norton Show, which attracts more than 2 million viewers per episode. Winkleman has been a guest presenter on Norton’s show.Winkleman’s programme will not replace Norton’s, which has just been renewed for three years. It will be made by the same producers, So Television.While Norton’s show runs through the autumn and winter, Winkleman’s new platform will run in the spring. Its first guests have not yet been announced.Kalpna Patel-Knight, the head of entertainment commissioning at the BBC, said: “Claudia is a true national treasure – warm, witty and endlessly entertaining. She has an extraordinary ability to put people at ease and bring out the very best in them, whether they’re global superstars or members of the audience.“It’s very exciting that she will be fronting her very own show on the BBC and we can’t wait for viewers to join Claudia and her sofa full of stars.”Explore more on these topicsClaudia WinklemanTelevision industryBBC OneBBCEntertainment TVnewsShareReuse this content"

She was stunned bythe findings.“I was seeing hundreds of medicinal molecules, like molecules that are known to have some sort of biological medicinal property,” Espinoza recalled. “And the variety was also really wild – these molecules have been known to have antiinflammatory effects or antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidant, even anti-cancer.”Espinoza, who has written a book,The Spirit of the Rainforest, about her work in the Amazon, began leading expeditions to learn more about stingless bees, working with Indigenous people to document the traditional methods of finding and cultivating the insects, and harvesting their honey.Found in tropical regions across the world, stingless bees, a class that encompasses a number of varieties, are the oldest bee species on the planet. About half of the world’s 500 known species live in the Amazon, where they are responsible for pollinating more than 80% of the flora, including such crops as cacao, coffee and avocados.They also hold deep cultural and spiritual meaning for the forest’s Indigenous Asháninka andKukama-Kukamiriapeoples. “Within the stingless bee lives Indigenous traditional knowledge, passed down since the time of our grandparents,” said Apu Cesar Ramos, president of EcoAshaninka of the Ashaninka Communal Reserve. “The stingless bee has existed since time immemorial and reflects our coexistence with the rainforest.”From the outset, Espinoza began hearing reports that the bees were becoming more difficult to find. “We were talking actively with the different community members and the first things they were saying, which they still do to this day, is: ‘I cannot see my bees any more. It used to take me 30 minutes walking into the jungle to find them. And now it takes me hours.’”Her chemical analysis had also turned up some concerning findings. Traces of pesticides were appearing in the stingless bees’ honey – despite their being kept in areas far from industrial agriculture.A lack of awareness about stingless bees made obtaining funding for research difficult, Espinoza said. So at the same time as beginning fieldwork, she and her colleagues began advocating for recognition of the insects, both in Peru and at the International Union for theConservationof Nature (IUCN).View image in fullscreenThe stingless bees hold deep cultural and spiritual meaning for the forest’s Indigenous Asháninka and Kumama-Kukamiria peoples.Photograph: Luis Garcia/HandoutFor years, the only kinds of bees to have official recognition in Peru have been European honeybees, brought to the continent by colonisers in the 1500s.“It almost created a vicious cycle. I cannot give you the funding because you’re not on the list, but you cannot even get on the list because you don’t have the data. You don’t have the funding to get it.” In 2023, they formally began a project to map the extent and ecology of the bees, “because by that time we had already spoken with the IUCN team and some government people in Peru and understood that that data was critical.”The mapping revealed links between deforestation and the decline of stingless bees – research that helped contribute to the passing of a law in 2024recognising stingless bees as the native bees of Peru. The law was a critical step, as Peruvian law requires the protection of native species.Dr César Delgado, a researcher at the Institute of Investigation of the Peruvian Amazon, described stingless bees as “primary pollinators” in the Amazon, contributing not just to plant reproduction, but also to biodiversity, forest conservation and global food security.But their research revealed something else too.An experiment in 1950s Brazil to create a strain that would produce more honey in tropical conditions led to the creation of the Africanised honeybee – a variety that was also more aggressive, earning them the fearsome moniker “African killer bees”. Now, Espinoza and her colleagues found, these Africanised bees have begun outcompeting the comparatively gentle stingless bees in their own habitats.On an expedition in the Amazonian highlands of Junin, southern Peru, they met Elizabeth, an Asháninka elder, who told them of what Espinoza said was “the strongest example of [bee] species competition that I have ever seen”.Living a semi-nomadic lifestyle in a remote part of theAvireri Vraem Biosphere reserve, Elizabeth farmed and kept bees at a spot in the forest some distance from her home. But she described how her stingless bees had been displaced by Africanised bees, which attacked her violently whenever she visited.“I felt so scared, to be honest,” said Espinoza. “Because I have heard of that before, but not to that extent. She had horror in her eyes and she kept looking at me straight and asking: ‘how do I get rid of them? I hate them. I want them gone’.”It is the municipality where Elizabeth lives, Satipo, that became the first to pass an ordinance granting legal rights to stingless bees in October. Across theAvireri Vraem reservethe bees will now have rights to exist and thrive, to maintain healthy populations, to a healthy habitat free from pollution, ecologically stable climatic conditions and, crucially, to be legally represented in cases of threat or harm. A second municipality, Nauta, in the Loreto region, approved a matching ordinance on Monday 22 December.The ordinances are precedents with no equivalent worldwide. According to Prieto they will establish a mandate requiring policies for the bees’ survival, “including habitat reforestation and restoration, strict regulation of pesticides and herbicides, mitigation of and adaptation to the impacts of climate change, the advancement of scientific research, and the adoption of the precautionary principle as a guiding framework for all decisions that may affect their survival.”Already, a global petition by Avaaz calling on Peru to make the law nationwide has reached more than 386,000 signatures, and there has also been strong interest from groups in Bolivia, the Netherlands and the US who want follow the municipalities’ examples as a basis to advocate for the rights of their own wild bees.Ramos said: “The stingless bee provides us with food and medicine, and it must be made known so that more people will protect it. For this reason, this law that protects bees and their rights represents a major step forward for us, because it gives value to the lived experience of our Indigenous peoples and the rainforest.”Explore more on these topicsBeesConservationAmazon rainforestInsectsDeforestationTrees and forestsnewsShareReuse this content"

These are alarm signals we cannot ignore, and we need to work faster, smarter and in a more joined-up way.”View image in fullscreenGardeners clear algae from the Moon Ponds at Fountains Abbey, North Yorkshire.

At least a dozen of the most serious events of the past decade would have been all but impossible without human-caused global heating.The fires had a dramatic impact. A blaze onAbergwesyn Common in mid Walesin April, burned across more than 5,000 hectares of peatland and destroyed habitats for small mammals, reptiles and birds, including golden plover, skylark, raven, red kite, common lizard, common frog, field vole and rare dragonflies such asthe black darter. Rangers said the ecological damage will be felt for decades.Further north in Wales there were concerns that thetufted saxifragemay vanish from the slopes ofEryri (Snowdonia)because of the heat. The trust said there were only seven of the plants known to still cling on. Happily, they just about survived.View image in fullscreenTufted saxifrage in bloom in Eryri (Snowdonia).

Numbers crashed in parched grasslands at theMottisfont estate in HampshireandSherborne estatein Gloucestershire.Low rainfall left streams and ponds perilously low or dry at places includingFountains Abbey in North Yorkshirewhile atTattershall Castle in Lincolnshire, breeding ponds for great crested newts dried up. On the Merseyside coast, Formby’s natterjack toads producing no toadlets.Extreme weather continued to place unprecedented strain on trees, the trust said.Newly planted saplings suffered losses of up to 40%, rather than the expected 10-15%, while mature trees showed stress through early leaf loss, limb drop and reduced canopy colour.View image in fullscreenA barn owl at Blakeney Point, Norfolk.

There was a 30% decline in Arctic tern nests atLong Nanny in Northumberlandand puffin numbers fell by a third on Farne Islands off the coast of north-east England.The mild, wet autumn triggered a second flush for a range of plants. AtNewark Park in Gloucestershire, staff noticed woodland holly flowering in November, while in thePeak District in Derbyshirethe summer-flowering harebell was blooming in November.Other unusual sights included apple trees blossoming in Nottinghamshire and Herefordshire in September and October, and roses blooming in Hampshire in December.View image in fullscreenA female heath fritillary on Exmoor, south-west England.

Bats andbrimstone butterflieswere still on the wing in November in Suffolk, while jackdaws, hooded crows and rooks were flocking and rebuilding their rookeries atMount Stewart in Northern Irelandmany months early.Despite the extreme weather, there were some winners. “Generalist” species such as grey seals, carrion crows and speckled wood butterflies did well thanks to their ability to adapt to warmer temperatures and survive on a varied diet.It was a fine year for berries and nuts in many places.Dunham Massey in Cheshiresaw the largest acorn crop in living memory, while across the South Downs and Chilterns in southern England hedgerows were thick with berries.The trust flagged up successful schemes such as “stage 0” at theHolnicote Estate on Exmoor, south-west England, where a lush wetland has been created, enabling species including water voles, great white egrets and flocks of gold finches to thrive.At Holnicote, one of the UK’s rarest butterflies – the heath fritillary –enjoyed a dramatic resurgence. More than 1,000 individuals were recorded across 13 sites, up from about 600 last year.McCarthy said: “While adaptable species are coping, those with specialist needs are in steep decline. The homogenisation of the wider countryside is accelerating this trend. Protected sites such as SSSIs [sites of special scientific interest] can no longer act as a safety net; they’re too small and too fragmented to form an effective ecological network. Without urgent, joined-up effective action, nature will continue to decline.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisWildlifeFarmingDroughtWildfiresExtreme weatherShareReuse this content"

With low pressure in the west drawing up warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico, much of the south and midwest basked in spring-like weather this weekend with temperatures widely an extraordinary 15-20C above normal for late December.This week, however, most people will ditch their summer clothes for hats and scarves as a ridge pressure builds across the west, allowing for a polar air mass to dive southward, bringing freezing temperatures and the risk of snow.Remarkably high temperatures have not just been confined to North America in recent days, with São Paulo in Brazil recently recording a maximum temperature of 36.2C – the highest on record for December. Further high temperatures are expected to start this week with the heat spreading to parts of Chile and Argentina later.Across the Pacific, winter has firmly established itself inJapanwith severe weather causing havoc to daily life. Heavy snow and icy conditions resulted in a deadlypile-up last Friday on a motorway in Minakami, Gunma prefecture, leaving two dead and dozens injured. More heavy snow is forecast this week as bitterly cold westerly winds from Siberia blow across the comparatively warmer Sea of Japan, picking up moisture and resulting in a phenomenon known as “sea-effect” snow that can affect much of northern and western Japan.View image in fullscreenBurnt vehicles after a large pile-up on an expressway in Minakami, Japan, last week.Photograph: APSummer storms have hammered parts of the South Island ofNew Zealandwith torrential rain, large hail and lightning, which has caused severe disruption to travel in many places in recent days, with the Canterbury Plains seeing a rare and powerful “supercell” storm.

On the highest routes and hills, 30cm or more may build through the period, the forecaster added.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued the amber alert, and said it meant the weather was likely to cause significant impacts across health and social care services, including a rise in deaths among those with health conditions or aged 65 or over.Temperatures elsewhere are expected to be 4-6C from New Year’s Day and there is a yellow health alert in place.The Met Office said the final days of 2025 would not be “particularly fantastic”, with temperatures of 7-8C, but things would take a turn as 2026 arrived.Northern parts of the UK are expected to bear the brunt of the chillier conditions from 1 January onwards, with brisk winds bringing increasingly wintry showers to the north as the week progresses.The Met Office forecaster Dan Stroud said: “We’re losing this sort of settled but chilly conditions, and bringing in something a little bit more showery with more wintry hazards in the forecast, particularly for the north of the country.”The UKHSA said the UK may also see impacts on younger people and there would probably be an increase in demand for health services across the regions.It also warned of “temperatures inside places like hospitals and care homes dropping below the levels recommended for assessing health risks”, and “challenges keeping indoor temperatures at the recommended 18C leading to more risk to vulnerable people”.It said there may be staffing issues because of external factors such as travel delays, and that other sectors such as transport and energy could start to be affected.The agency has issued a yellow cold health alert for the East Midlands, West Midlands, south-east, south-west, east ofEngland, Yorkshire and the Humber, and London. A yellow alert means there is potential for significant impacts.Dr Agostinho Sousa, the head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: “As the colder weather sets in it is vital to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable. The forecasted temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, leading to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections, particularly for individuals over the age of 65 and those with pre-existing health conditions.”The Alzheimer’s Society said colder temperatures could be difficult for people with dementia to adjust to and they may not recognise they are cold or be able to communicate it.The charity has urged people to check in on loved ones, friends and neighbours living with dementia to ensure they are dressed appropriately, in a warm room and eating, drinking and moving regularly. Making the most of natural daylight, sticking to a routine and encouraging smaller, slower steps in slippery conditions could also help to keep them safe, the charity said.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherSnowScotlandNorth of EnglandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He is believed to have been the driver of one of the vehicles involved in the crash on the A11.The IOPC said a non-police-issue firearm was found at the scene. Tests are under way to determine if the weapon found, which is understood to look like a handgun, could fire lethal bullets or was a replica.Norfolk police said: “Officers were called to London Road at around 8.25pm on Sunday 28 December 2025 following reports of a two-vehicle collision.“One man, believed to be the driver of one of the vehicles, left the scene holding what was described as a handgun.“Armed response officers attended and the suspect was subsequently shot by police a short distance away.”By law, police shootings have to be independently investigated by the police watchdog.The IOPC said: “At this early stage, we have established via police call logs that Norfolk constabulary officers responded to a report of a collision involving two vehicles on London Road shortly before 8.30pm.“Armed officers responded after it was reported that a man was seen leaving the collision scene holding what was described to be a handgun.“Officers found a man by the A11 a short time later. We can confirm that two shots were fired by police shortly before 9pm.“First aid was provided at the scene, however the man was sadly declared deceased shortly before 10.15pm.”The dead man’s relatives and loved ones have been informed.The IOPC said its investigators had taken initial accounts from the officers involved, examined police logs, and secured police body-worn video footage. Fuller accounts from officers involved were expected to be taken in about two days.Its director, Amanda Rowe, said: “Fatal police shootings are rare, however when they do occur it’s essential that an independent investigation is carried out into the actions and decision-making of the officers involved.”The Norfolk assistant chief constable, David Buckley, said: “Our highly trained armed officers deploy to hundreds of firearms-related calls each year, but incidents where police discharge firearms are thankfully incredibly rare. A full and independent investigation is already under way.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Search and recovery experts are still looking for the body of the second child.Gloucestershire police are not treating the fire as suspicious and say they believe it to have been a tragic accident. The family, who have not been named, are said to be popular and much loved in the Brimscombe Hill area of Stroud.Speaking at the police headquarters in Gloucester, Det Supt Ian Fletcher said emergency services were called at 3am on Boxing Day to a “well-established” fire.Fletcher said the mother and father had been woken in the early hours by the blaze. “They attempted to get to their children in the back bedroom. They’ve been unable to get to the back bedroom due to the ferocity and the heat of that fire.“The father has smashed his way out of the house through a bathroom window in order to try to access the children’s bedroom via the outside. He’s been unable to enter via that bedroom window. He’s then tried to re-enter the property through the bathroom window, by which stage the fire has taken hold in the bathroom and he’s unable to get back into the upstairs.“He’s subsequently gone downstairs and tried to force entry via the front and the back door but has been unable to get back inside into the property and it’s at this point our colleagues from emergency services, fire police et cetera have attended and have started managing the fire.”The man was treated at hospital. Fletcher said it was believed the fire began on the ground floor and worked its way up. He said the roof had fallen in.The body of an adult woman has been recovered, believed to be the mother, who was in her late 30s. A child’s body has also been found but is still in situ. The search for the body of the second child is ongoing. The girl was seven, the boy four. It is not yet known which one has been found.Fletcher said: “The husband is a serving police officer with Gloucestershire constabulary. He’s working with us to try to understand what exactly has happened.“We’ve had multiple witnesses describe the anguish that he was going through, his inability to get in and save his children and save his wife. He’s a well-liked officer in Gloucestershire constabulary. He’s worked for us for a number of years.”Gloucestershire’s deputy chief fire officer, Nathaniel Hooton, said an urban search and rescue team from Avon fire and rescue service was helping the recovery effort. He said fire crews had “tried their hardest” to get into the house to rescue the family.Chloe Turner, the leader of Stroud district council, said the community was reeling. “The family are known and loved locally,” she said.The Gloucestershire temporary chief constable, Maggie Blyth, said: “This is an unimaginable tragedy and my thoughts are with our colleague, along with all of those involved and impacted by what has happened.“At a time when we are all acutely aware of family and the joys that they can bring, my heart breaks at the indescribable pain that they must be experiencing.”A cordon remains in place at the address and an emergency services presence is expected to continue for several days as the site is structurally unstable.The British Red Cross has said support is available for anyone who needs it on 0808 196 3651. A local church is being opened to offer support for local people who have been affected.Explore more on these topicsGloucestershireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He gets the job done quickly.”View image in fullscreenAttenborough with a harvest mouse in a meadow in west London.Photograph: Joe Loncraine/BBC/Passion Planet LtdAccording to Loncraine, the film-making team ruled out certain ideas for “pieces to camera” on account of Attenborough’s age but then discovered that their presenter was more than willing to try them.“We’d have these ideas and think, ‘OK – can’t do that’ and then discover he was up for it and it was really great. I’ve worked with presenters in their 30s who would moan about that. He’s fantastic.”In the documentary, Attenborough takes viewers to one of his favourite buildings, the Natural History Museum, to find emperor dragonflies, as well as visiting parliament for peregrines and the ancient oaks of Richmond Park.But it is the new iterations of the “two-shot” – where Attenborough is pictured interacting with foxes, hedgehogs, harvest mice, peregrine chicks and even parakeets – that are likely to most delight viewers.“He has a calmness around animals,” said Loncraine. “As we’ve all seen with his encounters with blue whales and mountain gorillas he can do exactly what he’s there to do – deliver information – but still react to what the animal is doing in the most perfect way. That enthusiasm and his own natural curiosity is infectious.”View image in fullscreenAttenborough watched enraptured as young foxes gambolled around his deckchair at dusk in north London.Photograph: Gavin Thurston/BBC/Passion Planet LtdThe wild foxes were filmed by Matt Maran who has followed a fox family near his home for a decade, and knew exactly when and where to find them. But remarkably, the scene where Attenborough meets the foxes was shot in just one evening.“We were lucky with the weather this year and we just got lucky that not only one fox came up to him but we had another one,” said Loncraine.Attenborough is as enthusiastic about the humble tube-riding pigeon and leopard slugs as he is about the much-loved hedgehogs he watches after dark, lying down in an Ealing back garden.According to Loncraine, Attenborough was most keen to tell stories of rewilding and nature restoration in the film. In 1936, aged 10, Attenborough attended a lecture by the conservationist Grey Owl (Archibald Belaney), and was struck by his determination to save the Canadian beaver.Eighty-nine years later, Attenborough reflected upon the amazing sight of Eurasian beavers in Europe’s largest city, after they were reintroduced to fenced wetlands in Ealing and Enfield.View image in fullscreenAttenborough holding a peregrine falcon chick.Photograph: Gavin Thurston/BBC/Passion Planet LtdIn a piece to camera, Attenborough said: “If someone had told me when I first moved here that one day I would be watching wild beavers in London, I would’ve thought they were mad but there they are, right behind me, going about their own business.”According to the film-makers, Attenborough was keen that the documentary carry a clear message: people, and cities, need nature to be happy and healthy.“The importance of appreciating nature wherever it is and making space for nature in urban environments as key for him,” said Loncraine. “It isn’t just a collection of stories. We needed to make sure it was saying something about the benefit of these urban green spaces and the need to protect them and have more of them in cities.”In an elegiac final scene, Attenborough discusses how important Richmond Park has been in his life.Will this be Attenborough’s natural-history presenting swansong? “People have been asking that question for at least 10 years,” said Loncraine. “Anyone who makes the bet that this is his last would be foolish. I have no idea – but hopefully not.”Wild London airs on New Year’s Day at6.30pmonBBCOneExplore more on these topicsDavid AttenboroughLondonBBCBBC OneWildlifeRewildingMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

Fox, 55, was part of a group of more than a dozen swimmers who left from Lovers Point near Monterey, California, on 21 December, but she never returned to shore. A witness driving by the area reported to authorities that they saw a shark with what appeared to be a human body in its mouth emerge from the water,according to the San Francisco Chronicle.The disappearance and reports of the shark drew widespread public attention and efforts from authorities to locate Fox. On Sunday, Fox’s husband, Jean-François Vanreusel, and other members of her swim club held a memorialwalk along the Lovers Point coastline. Fox’s father, who confirmedthe death to NBC Bay Area, described his daughter as an empathetic and kind person who loved to swim, and who had taken part in numerous triathlons including the annualEscape From Alcatrazchallenge.Authorities last week launched a large-scale search and rescue operation involving multiple US Coast Guard boat crews along with responders from local fire and police departments to look for Fox. The Coast Guardsuspended its searchlast Monday for Fox after a 15-hour operation covering about 84 nautical miles.California firefighters announced on Saturday that they had recovered a body on Davenport beach, just south of Santa Cruz. The Santa Cruz county sheriff’s office issued a statement the same day, citing an ongoing investigation into the death.“Today, at approximately 2:00 pm, a body was recovered from the ocean south of Davenport Beach. Due to the close proximity to the recent shark attack victim in Monterey County, our agency is working closely with the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office and the Pacific Grove Police Department regarding the recovery,” the Santa Cruz county sheriff’s office said.Editor and fellow swimmer Sara Rubin,writing inMonterey County Weekly, described Fox as a friend and passionate athlete who found peace in the Pacific Ocean.“Twenty years ago, Erica Fox and a friend started swimming every Sunday at Lovers Point in Pacific Grove. Since then, multiple books have been written about the science of swimming and what it does for our brains. But Erica never needed a book to tell her what she knew through experience: Swimming in the ocean is a balm for body and mind, an adventure as much as a meditation.” Rubin wrote. “She developed a deeply intimate relationship with the Pacific Ocean not by studying it or by looking at it, but by getting into it—again and again and again, on choppy days and gloriously calm days, logging what I can only guess are thousands of miles.”Rubin said that Fox “understood the risk” of swimming in an ocean with a population of great white sharks, and would “object to framing this as an attack, and she would urge us to instead call it an incident—an animal’s behavior is just that”.Although many species of sharks live off the California coast, violent incidents with humans are extremely rare. Prior to Fox’s death, there have been16 shark-related fatalitiesin California in the past 75 years.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaSharksTriathlonWest CoastMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

Doctors decided to postpone the same procedure on the left side until Monday to mitigate potential risks.Brazilian president vows to veto bill cutting Jair Bolsonaro’s prison termRead more“Procedure completed. Thank God, we are now waiting for him to be taken back to his room,” wrote the former president’s wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, who has been accompanying him during his hospital stay. Earlier, she said: “It’s been nine months of struggle and anguish with daily hiccups.”Dr Claudio Birolini later told journalists that Bolsonaro was expected to be discharged on 1 January, provided his recovery remains uneventful.At the request of his defence lawyers, Bolsonaro was authorised by supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes to leave prison for the hernia surgery. In a statement issued while he was in the hospital, Bolsonaro endorsed the 2026 presidential bid of his son, Flavio Bolsonaro.Once discharged from the hospital, Bolsonaro will return to serving his sentence at a federal police jail in Brasilia.He has had health problems since he wasstabbed during a presidential campaign event in September 2018.Bolsonaro underwent multiple abdominal surgeries after the attack.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2024, the north African state signed a new migration partnership with the European Union in exchange for €210m (£181m) in funding.A recent report by Human Rights Watch accused Mauritanian authorities of systematic abuses of the mainly African migrants, including rape and torture – accusations that the Mauritanian government rejects.The Caminando Fronteras report concludes that the Atlantic route from north Africa to the Canary Islands, which can take up to 12 days, remains the deadliest, with 1,906 fatalities this year. The increasingly popular route from Algeria to the Balearic Islands cost the lives of 1,037 migrants. The report also notes the emergence of a new route from Guinea to the Canaries, a distance of 2,200km.Maleno described a policy of “necropolitics” fuelled by far-right parties, saying “the persecution and witch-hunts of migrants is having a huge impact on human rights in Europe”.“The institutional response to tragedies at sea remains patently inadequate,” the report concludes. “Although there has been collaboration between countries in some cases, there are still worrying delays in mobilising rescue missions, a lack of adequate resources and limited political will to protect lives.”The 3,090 victims come from 30 countries, mostly in west and north Africa, but also Pakistan, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Iraq and Egypt.Explore more on these topicsSpainMigrationMauritaniaAfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Some previous executives in the post have lasted only for short periods.The opening comes against a backbeat of warnings from inside the AI industry about the risks of the increasingly capable technology. On Monday, Mustafa Suleyman, the chief executive of Microsoft AI, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I honestly think that if you’re not a little bit afraid at this moment, then you’re not paying attention.”Demis Hassabis, the Nobel prize-winning co-founder of Google DeepMind, this monthwarned of risksthat included AIs going “off the rails in some way that harms humanity”.Amid resistance from Donald Trump’s White House, there is little regulation of AI at national or international level. Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist known as one of the “godfathers of AI”, said recently: “A sandwich has more regulation than AI.” The result is that AI companies are largely regulating themselves.Altman said on X as he launched the job search: “We have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities, but we are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides both in our products and in the world, in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits. These questions are hard and there is little precedent.”One user responded sardonically: “Sounds pretty chill, is there vacation included?”What is included is an unspecified slice of equity in OpenAI, a company that has been valued at $500bn.Last month, the rival company Anthropicreportedthe first AI-enabled cyber-attacks in which artificial intelligence acted largely autonomously under the supervision of suspected Chinese state actors to successfully hack and access targets’ internal data. This month, OpenAIsaidits latest model was almost three times better at hacking than three months earlier and said “we expect that upcoming AI models will continue on this trajectory”.OpenAI is also defending a lawsuit from the family of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old from California who killed himself after alleged encouragement from ChatGPT. It hasarguedRaine misused the technology. Another case, filed this month, claims ChatGPT encouraged the paranoid delusions of a 56-year-old in Connecticut, Stein-Erik Soelberg, who then murdered his 83-year old mother and killed himself.An OpenAI spokesperson said it was reviewing the filings in the Soelberg case, which it described as “incredibly heartbreaking” and that it was improving ChatGPT’s training “to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAISam AltmanComputingCybercrimeHackingInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

The last few months of the year have seen$1tn in valuewiped from the digital asset market, despite bitcoin hitting an all-time-high price of$126,000on 6 October.The October price peak was short-lived. Bitcoin’s price tumbled just days later after Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on China sent shockwaves across the market on 12 October. The crypto market saw $19bn liquidated in 24 hours – the largestliquidation eventon record. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency,sawa 40% drop in price over the next month. Eric Trump’s own crypto company endured a similar drop in its value in December.In Donald Trump, the crypto industry was delivered the pro-bitcoin president they were promised during his campaign. Within days of taking office for the second time, he issued anexecutive orderthat repealed restrictions on cryptocurrency and introduced new favorable regulations as well as a presidential working group on digital assets.“The digital asset industry plays a crucial role in innovation and economic development in the United States, as well as our Nation’s international leadership,” the order read. He placed cryptocurrency front and center in American policy.Again in March, Trump announced a new strategic cryptocurrency reserve that fueled a62% rally in the market prices of three out of five of the coinsnamed to the reserve. Bitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, went up 10% to $94,164 in the hours after the reserve was announced.A line chart visualizing the fluctuating price of bitcoin over the past yearCryptocurrency is sensitive to both narratives and confidence in global markets, said Rachael Lucas, the head of marketing and communications at BTC Markets, Australia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. It’s what is called a risk-on asset, an investment that does better when investors are feeling confident about the economy and are willing to take on more risk, Lucas said.“The Trump administration may be pro-crypto, but tariffs and tight monetary policy outweigh positive vibes,” said Lucas. “And it’s also just a reminder, especially for people in crypto, that macro forces really matter more than political stances.”In November, bitcoinsufferedits biggest drop in price since 2021, bringing the coin’s value to less than $81,000. While bitcoin regained some of that value in the weeks after, the digital token started December with another slump, dropping 6% afterStrategy, the biggest holder of bitcoin, cut its earnings forecast because of the slide in crypto prices. Bitcoin’s price now hovers near $90,000, up from years past but significantly lower than its peak.In the first few days of December 2025, Eric Trump’s cryptofirm, American Bitcoin Corp, saw 40% of its value – roughly $1bn – wiped out.The Trump family scion put on a bullish face and declared he would ride out the decline. “I’m holding all my @ABTC shares - I’m 100% committed to leading the industry,” Eric Trump said on X at the time.Some experts fear the industry is entering a so-called crypto winter, a prolonged period of stagnation or losses. The last time, crypto winter lasted from the end of 2021 through 2023, when the FTX mogul Sam Bankman-Fried was tried and convicted. Those years saw bitcoin slump 70% inprice.Despite the optimism fueled by Trump’s win, the current market downturn shows the crypto-friendly administration wasn’t enough to usher in a return to the “retail mania” of 2021, when there was a huge upswing in individual stock trading, said Christian Catalini, the founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab.“The recent crash isn’t a change in sentiment, but a collision of three structural factors: the aftershocks of a $19bn leverage washout in October; a risk-off rotation driven by US-China tariff tensions; and, crucially, the potential unraveling of the corporate treasury trade,” Catalini said.Another potential factor that may have shaken the crypto market is the downturn in share prices of AI stocks like Nvidia, said Lucas.“One of the reasons why bitcoin is tied to the AI cycle is because a lot of the bitcoin miners actually started leveraging their energy towards new datacenters,” she said. “Not only is crypto a technical asset, we have the miners actually tied into AI devices going up. That negative sentiment tends to sneak into crypto.”Despite concerns over a crypto winter, notable players in the crypto space Larry Fink, the CEO of investment management firm BlackRock, and Brian Armstrong, the co-founder of Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, expressedoptimismabout the long-term value of the currency at a recent New York Times conference. Armstrong said “there was no chance” the price of bitcoin would go to zero and in fact 2025 would be seen as the year “when crypto went from gray market to a well-lit establishment”. Fink, for his part, said his firm had observed “legitimate long owners investing in the currency”, including sovereign wealth funds.Lucas said that this downturn in crypto prices was not inconsistent with past four-year bitcoin cycles and that she was not worried about entering a much more sustained crypto winter.“If I was looking at it from a traditional bitcoin cycle, we are actually technically in a bear market,” said Lucas. “But as you can see, even with all of these macros that are affecting the market, bitcoin has still managed to set a price above $80,000.”Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Not a lot. Actually less than I would’ve thought. But it’s there.”Official figures released by Beijing this month show China’s trade surplus reached more than $1tn in the year to November for the first time, as manufacturers shipped more to non-US markets to sidestep Trump’s tariffs.While exports to the US plummeted by 29% year-on-year, sales to markets elsewhere ballooned, including a 15% rise in exports to the EU and 9% jump to the UK compared with the same period a year earlier.In its November monetary policy report, the Bank said Chinese exports to the UK and euro area had increased, while those to the US had declined. “Early evidence suggests [tariffs] are having a relatively limited effect on global growth and a slightly disinflationary impact on the UK, driven mainly by trade diversion,” the report said.Headline inflation in the UK isrunning at 3.2%and is forecast to drop close to the 2% target set by the government by the middle of 2026. Measures inRachel Reeves’s autumn budget– including relief on energy bills and fuel duty – are expected tocut the headline rateby as much as 0.5 percentage points.This month the Bankcut its base rateby a quarter-point to 3.75% amid cooling inflationary pressures. Financial markets predict Threadneedle Street will probably reduce borrowing costs by at least another quarter-point in 2026 amid weaker levels of economic growth and rising unemployment.China ranks as the UK’s largest market for imports behind Germany, with £70bn shipped to Britain in the year to June, an increase of 4.1% from a year earlier.Cars, telecoms and sound equipment were the main imports.Millard said the impact on UK inflation from an increase in Chinese imports was unlikely to be large, but could still add to a slowdown in the headline inflation rate in 2026.“There is potential for a fall in the price of Chinese imports as they attempt to sell more into the UK, which could have a reasonable effect on our import price index,” he added.Diversion of Chinese exports has rung alarm bells for European manufacturers worried about being undercut by a cheap influx of goods, leading to pressure on EU leaders and the UK government to respond.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said after a visit to Beijing in December that the EU could beforced to take “strong measures”to curb a ballooning imbalance between Chinese imports and exports with the 27-nation bloc.In the UK, ministers have pledged to protect domestic steel producers from a mounting glut of the metal on global markets, much of which comes from subsidised Chinese producers.However, buyers could benefit from lower prices, with the potential to alleviate concerns over inflationary pressures re-emerging next year.Jack Meaning, the UK chief economist at Barclays, said there was limited evidence of trade diversion from China so far, but suggested import prices in the UK were on track to moderate in 2026 amid weaker growth in the world economy.“Our forecast is for core goods inflation to decelerate as we move through 2026, from about 1.5% in 2025 to below 1%,” he said. “Part of that story is a more global slowdown; a reorganising of excess demand in the global economy, coming into the UK as a small open economy.”Explore more on these topicsInflationInternational tradeTrade policyTariffsChinaAsia PacificTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

There, on one of the walls, hung posters of Beyzaie’s 1988 film Maybe Some Other Time, positioned above and below the torn portraits of the supreme leaders of the theocratic regime.The symbolism – the ideological ruin; cinema and the future – was too striking for something so accidental, particularly given that Beyzaie’s theatre and cinema are intricate mazes of carefully constructed and overlapping allegorical moments.View image in fullscreenFrayed posters of Bahram Beyzaie’s 1988 film Maybe Some Other Time photographed in the ruins of Tehran’s oldest cinema, Cinema Iran in November.Photograph: Ali BakhtiariThe films of Beyzaie, who died on 26 December aged 87, are seamless blends of myth, symbolism, folklore, and classical Persian literature. Within their dizzying labyrinth of rituals, cinema becomes an act of dreaming.Outside the cinema, his profound devotion to Iran’s performing arts and literary traditions – both pre- and post-Islamic – resulted in the publication of more than 70 books, including histories, plays and screenplays.Beyzaie was born on 26 December 1938, into a Bahá’í family in Tehran. His belonging to a frequently persecuted religious minority became, particularly after the 1979 revolution, one of the factors contributing to the censorship of his work.He began writing plays and film criticism at a very young age, and his now canonical book Theatre in Iran was published when he was only 27.Like his contemporary Abbas Kiarostami, Beyzaie entered cinema by making short films for Kanoon, the state institution dedicated to producing cultural works for and about children and young adults. His second film for Kanoon, The Journey (1972), which follows an orphaned boy’s search for his parents as it leads him through the polluted wastelands on the outskirts of Tehran, was Beyzaie’s personal favourite. Overflowing with abandoned objects, the film reveals a country discarding its history at a frantic pace.Beyzaie’s preoccupation with the world of children continued in his finest post-revolutionary film, Bashu, the Little Stranger (1986). In it, an Arab-Iranian boy displaced by war from the south struggles to adapt to life in northern Iran. Beyzaie masterfully links the fragmentation of national identity to language and the failures of communication.His first feature, Downpour (1972), directed through an energetic and unusual combination of neorealism and political symbolism, was made on a shoestring budget. It tells the story of a young teacher sent to a school in an impoverished neighbourhood, where he falls in love with his student’s elder sister. A jury at the Tehran international film festival, presided over by Satyajit Ray, awarded the film the special jury prize.View image in fullscreenSymbolism and neorealism … Downpour (1972).Photograph: Bahram BeyzaieFrom the mid-1970s onward, however, women moved decisively to the centre of his films. Their quests for lost or absent persons become searches for identity itself. Surrounded by men who are corrupt, paranoid and indecisive, women fight back and take up the sword – sometimes literally – to defend their territory. These films fuse the ceremonial legends of the past with contemporary life and move beyond the confines of the victimised female figures common in Iranian cinema.The Stranger and the Fog (1974), a bold attack on religious conformity and an uncanny anticipation of the revolution, marked the beginning of this new period. In The Raven (1977) – an inquiry into media, image, and memory – the woman is fully central. Here, she is a deaf teacher who becomes obsessed with the image of a missing woman. Her investigation uncovers a far larger lost identity: early 20th-century Tehran.In The Ballad of Tara (1979), which centres on the ghost of a dead warrior who falls in love with a widow in a coastal village, Beyzaie reworked the samurai epics of Akira Kurosawa through a feminist lens. The completion of the film coincided with the revolution, and it was subsequently banned indefinitely – not so much for its political symbolism as for its portrayal of a woman who is both desired and fully in command of her own destiny.From Travellers (1992) to his final film, When We Are All Sleep (2009), Beyzaie continued to offer variations on the theme of women searching for identity, often through the act of identifying others. These later works were developed in close collaboration with his second wife, the actor Mojdeh Shamsai.View image in fullscreenKurosawa through a feminist lens … The Ballad of Tara (1979).Photograph: Bahram BeyzaieMuch of this period, however, was marred by sustained harassment from the Iranian regime, including acts of punitive retaliation such as his dismissal from the theatre department of the University of Tehran, where he had taught since 1973. During periods when he was unable to work as a director, Beyzaie wrote screenplays that were filmed by others and edited other film-makers’ work. Eventually, frustrated by the situation, he left Iran in 2010 for Stanford University, where he taught in the Iranian Studies programme and staged plays he had long been prevented from performing in Iran.In the wake of his death, Iranian director Jafar Panahi said: “We learned from him how to stand against forgetfulness.” Another film-maker, Asghar Farhadi, noted the bitter irony that “the most [culturally] Iranian of all Iranians died so far from Iran.”There is yet another bitter irony. Two weeks before his death, what remained of Cinema Iran was burned to the ground, as if a final symbolic moment from a Beyzaie film marking the end of a major chapter in Iranian cultural history. Yet the restoration of Beyzaie’s classic films – including two undertaken under the auspices of Martin Scorsese’s World Cinema Project – has only deepened and expanded his reputation, both inside and outside Iran. This is a Cinema Iran that no fire can erase.The Ballad of Tara and The Journey will screen at the Barbican Cinema, London, in February as part of itsMasterpieces of the Iranian New Waveseason.Explore more on these topicsFilmIranfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I had tried standup in my last year at university, then did three open mic gigs at the Edinburgh festival which offered strong evidence that I should give up. So I did. Eighteen months later, after a vague plan to try to get into sports journalism ended with me subediting articles about stock markets for a business publishing company (even less exciting than you might think), I booked one gig, at theComedyCafe’s Wednesday open mic night, hosted by Daniel Kitson. If that had gone badly, I don’t think I would have tried standup again. It went well enough to carry on, and within a year I was starting to get a few paid gigs, and standup gradually became my “job”.Can you recall a gig so bad, it’s now funny?In about 2002, I did a show in Killarney in Ireland. A very popular local act had to pull out, and they asked me to headline the gig instead. It was in a hotel nightclub where it was cheaper to go to the comedy and stay for the music rather than just go to the music. So the audience was a mixture of people who wanted to see someone else, and people who wanted to dance. The response to my set was a fascinating cocktail of silence, hostility, confusion, apathy, resentment and pity. The noise of the disco then kept me awake until 4am.Any pre-show rituals?Be thankful I’m not in a Killarney nightclub.Do you have a comedy hero?I don’t really like the idea of heroes and hero-worshipping. I loved the comedic invention and satirical ambition of The Day Today and Brass Eye before I did standup. Seeing Robert Newman at the fringe in 2000 inspired me to try doing more political material. I studied Ancient Greek comedy at university, specifically the plays of Aristophanes. In footballing parlance, it is ‘total’ comedy – everything from political satire and literary parody to slapstick, puns and dick jokes. If only he hadn’t sadly passed away more than 2,400 years ago, I’d love to have dinner with him. With an interpreter.What’s been one of your all-time favourite gigs?I did a couple of gigs at Naveed’s Comedy Club in Dhaka in Bangladesh while I was covering the 2011 men’s Cricket World Cup forESPNcricinfo. Naveed had set up Bangladesh’s first comedy club a year or so previously and asked me to do a show there. It was in a tiny basement room in a block of flats, which he had kitted out like a New York standup club – brick backdrop, photos of Seinfeld, Steve Martin and others on the wall. It was a strange, wonderful and inspiring experience.Best heckle?In my early years in comedy, I did a lot of student union gigs. At one in Leeds, someone in the front row went to sleep. She did not fall asleep. She actively decided to go to sleep. Hard to hit back at that.I used to do my fringe shows in the afternoon, and if there was a test match on, people would sometimes shout the latest score at me. Which was helpful, but did suggest I had not entirely commandeered their attention.What has inspired your latest show,The Zaltgeist?The increasing impossibility of understanding the world and its politics.Does satire feel harder, easier, or simply stranger in 2025 compared to recent years?All three of those. Plus: more exhausting, more repetitive, and more cathartic.What’s next for you?Hopefully, watching England pull off the greatest comeback in cricket history to win the Ashes. Then back home for a new series of The News Quiz, and the Zaltgeist tour.Andy Zaltzman: The Zaltgeist ison tourfrom 13 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStageComedy Q&AComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)featuresShareReuse this content"

A year before the award-lassoing Facebook drama, which led to an Oscar nomination for Eisenberg, the actor agonised through the dreamy foreground of Adventureland as reluctant carny James Brennan.The parallels between Fincher’s and Greg Mottola’s movies begin and end with their opening unceremonious separations, yet an admittedly romantic logic does allow me to soak in the notion that the great directorial mind behind such zingers as Zodiac and Gone Girl also found solace in this cinematic time machine.Bouncing through the year 1987 under a cloud of weed and Lou Reed, wannabe “travel essayist” James suffers a reality check when his dad’s demotion means that the family can no longer fund a planned European jolly with his best mate, Eric.‘Cue air punches and tears’: why Next Goal Wins is my feelgood movieRead moreFaced with an empty summer before studying at Columbia University, the Charles Darwin acolyte manages to bag himself a job at the titular theme park, where amusement stations are inexplicably slapped with names like the Flighing Dutchman. “You got a concussion on the teacup ride there when you were six,” is his mum’s scepticism that doubles down on our protagonist’s unsuitability for Adventureland. The delicious thing about this retro limbo realm of yawning-clown bins, unashamedly rigged games and Tilt-A-Whirls is the fact that almost none of its poorly paid denizens belong there.Take maintenance guy Connell for instance, played byRyan Reynolds. He’s coolly tricked everyone into believing that he once jammed with the aforementioned Velvet Underground legend; swaggering through the ice-cream and candy floss chaos like some sort of god while his admiring co-workers wave from their various vomit-stained habitats.Adventureland’s evergreen feelgood factor is partly associated with the pre-Deadpool era, where future world-beater Reynolds wasn’t indulged by major Hollywood studios to essentially play a carbon copy of himself in a superhero gimp suit, or to front sappy football documentaries with that trademark toilet wit. Here, he’s tethered to a specific lovelorn reality wherenobodycan go home with a plush “giant ass panda”. That’s a warning delivered early doors by Bill Hader’s unhinged park co-runner Bobby – “Just gimme a fucking reason, you don’t know what I’m capable of!” he seethes at a jock wanting to knock seven shades out of James – the star reteaming with Superbad director Mottola for a much richer and sophisticated portrait of YA yearning.Just like that movie’s Seth, Evan and McLovin, James spends the duration negotiating the awkwardness of the “Scarlet V”, while his hyaena-like torturer Frigo pummels him with bollock-busting jabs in front of the very girls he hopes to slide into bed with. The big difference between Adventureland and every other coming-of-age comedy of my lifetime, though, is its soul-lifting nostalgia neatly embodied by the now-fossilising funfair. I’m so taken by this iconography of yesteryear that I even bought the same blue T-shirt that James wears for his uniform (it’s been reduced to a fence-painting scruff over the years). Ironically, you’ll never catch me on a rollercoaster. Riddle me that one?Mottola’s 2009 movie continues to reel me back in as a memory portal to my first-ever job too. Making friends at a local clothing shop located next-door to my favourite haunt: the cinema; the pranks we’d often pull on each other to get through the days; the nights out together; surprise hook-ups; that blissful sense of freedom before life got real, and the silly energy of a busy seasonal period. It was all about the people on shift with you and Adventureland is an echo of those times, encased in celluloid. “I’m amazed at how tiny my paycheck is, I’ve been working doubles …” James complains to Joel (Martin Starr), which is sardonically met with: “Well, we are doing the work of lazy, pathetic morons.” Fair play to all of the retail staff out there, especially over Christmas, but these quotes really did ring true for me way back when.Then there’s a soundtrack beamed in from the 80s, painting sequences (including a stoned session on the dodgems) with the colours of David Bowie, the Replacements, INXS, Crowded House and the Cure. Bastards of the Young blasting over the animated Miramax banner? This is both pure euphoric escapism and a cutting reminder that teen comedies peaked a long time ago.Adventureland is available to rent digitally in the US and UK and on Stan in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsJesse EisenbergMy feelgood movieKristen StewartKristen WiigRyan ReynoldsComedy filmsComedyRomance filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But this Israeli-Belarusian co-production is so excessively sentimental, cliche-riddled and arguably hypocritical considering its provenance, it’s not easy to forbear.It opens in contemporary Tel Aviv with an elderly man named Ilya receiving news he can barely believe is true: someone dear to him from his childhood is alive. This prompts Ilya to tell his grandsons for the first time about what happened to him during the second world war. Desaturated cinematography then unfolds his story in flashback, showing young Ilya (Andrey Davidyuk) and his little brother Sasha as preteen Jewish boys living in Minsk with their parents, just as the war starts. Dad goes off to the front and is never seen again; the brothers and their mother are soon rounded up by the Nazis, represented by one German actor (Jean-Marc Birkholz) who keeps cropping up throughout to ruin life for Ilya. It’s as if the production didn’t have enough budget to afford a second German-speaking actor or (charitably) because the film-makers are making some kind of symbolic point about the banality – or in this case indistinguishability – of evil. I suspect the former is the case.After a spell in a concentration camp for children, Ilya is separated from his brother and ends up living with a Belarusian couple who lost their own son. Despite the risk of execution they’re incurring by sheltering a Jewish boy, the couple treat Ilya like their own son, and the man gives him a home-whittled wooden stork that Ilya promises to give to his little brother one day.There are a few Belarusians who side with the Nazis, and Soviet-affiliated partisans steal the family’s cow, but by and large the film paints a very ahistorical, excessively flattering portrait of ordinary Belarusians, who are mostly keen to help these poor orphaned Jewish kids even if they’re risking being murdered themselves. Elderly Ilya’s voiceover narration even says at one point: “But even knowing the consequences, none of the locals refused [to help hide people].” There’s some serious nationalist self-soothing in the way this film depicts its locals as entirely saintly, which, given Belarus’s alliance with Putin these days, really stinks.Stork of Hope is on digital platforms from 5 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsSecond world warHolocaustBelarusIsraelreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not an impression anyone would be left with from listening to her bitter, potent take on indie-rock. Hagerup’s guitar lines snake as they thrash; her balladry is grimy and expansive, steered by febrile vocals that recall mid-period Fiona Apple and the drone of the cello she played as a kid. Unexpected moments lurk, such as the shadowy slip into trip-hop on recent single Dirty Dog.“One thing I really value about music is that it’s one of a few ways that I can really connect to emotion, even if the emotion is feeling disconnected,” Hagerup says. “Day to day, I’m pushing those feelings away. Picking up a guitar, you could write about all the beautiful, happy things, but there’s something that pulls your attention a little more sometimes – you get to release this thing you’ve been holding for weeks, to really find the nucleus of the intensity.”Calling from a friend’s place in western Massachusetts, Hagerup is self-deprecating and wildly expressive – her first espresso has just kicked in – and occasionally talks in circles around her latest album, System. To write, she says, she has to not necessarily know what she’s writing about: from opening song Easy, “I was sniffing a flower but I snorted a bug” is the kind of emotional trap door she sketches so well. Looking back on what the album might mean now, she sees “moments of struggle” as well as bird’s-eye views of the challenges of living in intentionally oppressive systems.Prewn: System – video“In the moment, I didn’t realise I was depressed – it’s like watching your hair grow, you don’t realise you’ve gotten to a place that isn’t how you like to feel,” she says. “I would have a lot of shame about feeling so depressed when there’s so much beauty in the world. But then that’s just another way to judge yourself when you’re already low.”The making of System sounded pretty painful: Hagerup staying up all night, forcing herself to write until some scrap of muse appeared to her. Looking back, she thinks it’s a result of the “immense pressure” people put themselves under in their mid-20s as they figure life out. “Hopefully as I’m getting older and more comfortable, I can approach music from less of a desperate … ” she mimes wrenching something out of the ground. “A lot of fear got wrapped up in it, but now it feels back to how it used to, like music is for the joy of the moment.”Dinosaur Jr’s J Mascis: ‘I still get a kick out of making a racket’Read moreHagerup came of age musically in the famed western Massachusetts scene, where she stuck around after college far longer than she had planned. Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore used to live there; J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr was a regular sight on the bike paths near where Hagerup lived.“He wears his helmet!” she says. “I love this area so much. It’s beautiful but it doesn’t have enough going on to be distracting. I hadn’t been in a DIY scene before I moved here. I was like, what, we just get together and make this happen on our own?! Seeing all the work that went into the community was so beautiful. It totally changed the course of my life, and it gave me a lot of courage to do music on a more serious level.” Nevertheless, she moved to Los Angeles in the summer: “I was like, what if I went somewhere that I could never imagine myself?”Since releasing her debut, Through the Window, in 2023, Hagerup has become used to her growing fandom seeming shocked by the darkness of her music. “I think the most powerful music is the most honest music,” she shrugs. “If it’s getting a little dark in here: well, chase that.” But as much as she sings about giving in, System is full of reminders not to fear “the sound of your broken, beating, dripping, heaving heart”, as she sings on Don’t Be Scared.“That’s another thing I really value about music,” she says. “If you’re not going deep into the dark side, I don’t know how you can go deep into the light side.”Explore more on these topicsMusicNew music for 2026IndieinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Perhaps the poet was challenging herself initially to find the visible equivalent of thepareidolicMan in the Moon, often associated by English tradition with Sabbath-breakers and drunks. But there’s no nursery-friendly reassurance or comedy in the images Stevenson evokes in stanza one in order to reject them. The poem goes on to work out a denser portrayal of the man in the wind, where the figure retains political resonance, and its character as a threat to the civilised achievements and values of “our polite island”. It becomes a force of implacable nature, “without meaning or being”.In the first stanza, the “black monk” may refer to the bringer of delusory insight in Chekhov’s short story The Black Monk. A “mirage” or “phantom”, always swathed in black, this visitor convinces the story’s human protagonist, Kovrin, of its actual existence in nature, and persuades Kovrin of his own super-human genius. (The whole story, translated into English by REC Long,can be read here.)The monk is found by Stevenson to be a redundant personification of the wind. Inadequate, too, are the more politically weighted images of power and abuse, which evolve from the cowering “white face under the streetlight” and culminate in images and sounds of torture, when “the prisoner’s risen voice / bleeds over cymbals and timpani”. The speaker rejects both the extremes of superhuman power and human debasement, although after-images from the stanza haunt the rest of the poem.Rhythmically, the second stanza suggests a moment when the wind drops and the noise is replaced by something else, perhaps the ability of a mind to hear its own thoughts. The (necessary) interpretation of the man in the wind is the man himself, in all his “anger” and “fear” as the wind rises once more, and emits “… a roar, a continuous roar” that will become human.A particular skill of the poem is the composition of its soundscape: sparing rhymes, attention to assonance, the breath-like patternings of long and short lines that unselfconsciously reinforce the natural vision, the connection of wind and breath. The poem’s engineering insists on a certain interplay of beginnings and endings; it echoes the rhythm of the human mind, both in its lineation and its drive to understanding. Stevenson also keeps the larger breath-flow of the wind intact: she lets us hear the syntax-defying roar, a crescendo of sound unlike, though not entirely unrelated to, the “melancholy, long withdrawing roar” of the Sea of Faith in Matthew Arnold’sDover Beach.This wind-sound, compounded by the comparison to “waves where there is no shore”, shrinks the human time-span, the whole hypothetical time-horizon and the myth of beginnings and endings. It brilliantly “uncreates” the world, and makes us hear the terrifyingly unmanned and existential gale. Although the poem might be read, partly, as an American poet’s examination of the political weather in her adopted Britain of the early 1980s, its reach towards a concept of nature is immeasurably vaster.Anne Stevenson (1933- 2020), was an award-winning poet and critic.

In his new book, he takes a keen-eyed tour of eight English houses, from Northumberland to Sussex, dating from the early 1700s to exactly 100 years ago, and ranging from an outlandish gothic pile to one of the first council flats. In Cruickshank’s pages, classical influences from Rome and Greece give way to a revival of medieval English gothic and the emergence of modernism.He is particularly interested in who commissioned and built his chosen dwellings, and how they got the job done. It’s a new spin on the recent fashion for historians to explore the homes of commoners, as opposed to royalty and aristocrats, in order to tell the life stories of their occupants. This probably began with the late Gillian Tindall, who wrote a highly original book about the various tenants of an old house by the Thames next to the rebuilt Globe theatre. That was followed by several series of A House Through Time, fronted by Traitors star David Olosuga.At first sight, Cruickshank seems to have set himself a thankless task – and dragged the reader into it alongside him. When it comes to establishing how early buildings went up, there isn’t a lot to go on. “Few contemporary or intimate documents – such as letters or diary entries – survive in significant number that chronicle [their] creation,” he says. But all is not lost. “What does survive are building accounts that list names of tradesmen, sums charged and dates on which bills were paid.” He concedes that this throws up “somewhat arid evidence”, and he isn’t kidding: for lengthy stretches, “The English House” is constructed out of yellowed builder’s dockets mashed up with dense architectural jargon (“… a semi-elliptical colonnade formed by four free-standing Ionic columns supporting a full entablature and flanked by pedimented door surrounds”). Cruickshank could be forgiven for wishing that his book was accompanied by a TV series – with graphics to explain various construction techniques – and if so, he wouldn’t be the only one.View image in fullscreenThe kitchen at Cragside, an Arts and Crafts mansion in Northumberland.Photograph: The National Trust Photolibrary/AlamyA house is not a home, as Bacharach and David rightly told us, and fortunately Cruickshank’s research ends up revealing a surprising amount about the inhabitants of his eight properties. Pallant House in Chichester, now an art gallery, was the scene of lively arguments between the young swell who commissioned it and his older wife who paid for it all. This didn’t go unnoticed by their tradesmen, whose records of work on the house expose the couple’s frequent disagreements about what should go where and how much they should fork out for it. In Hull, a man called Henry Maisen built a fine house for himself in the mid-18th century but left most of the work to his brother, Nathaniel, while he enjoyed himself in London. In 1744, Nathaniel wrote him an exasperated letter care of “Mrs Rawlinson’s, A Toy Shop, Bedford Street, Covent Garden”. This was a red-light district, and as Cruickshank notes, the first children’s toy shop in the capital wouldn’t be open for another 16 years – so “it seems not unlikely that the toys available at Mrs Rawlinson’s were of a distinctly adult nature”.If the author is a little uncomfortable with this evidence of the ageless human comedy, he’s more receptive to the darker stories he uncovers. The Boundary Street estate in London’s Shoreditch, begun in the 1890s, was home to the first council flat “as we know it”, says Cruickshank. Though it replaced a notorious and fetid slum, most of the luckless inhabitants of the rookery were moved on rather than rehoused. A banker’s residence in Liverpool prompts an exploration of the port’s role in the transatlantic slave trade. A house built by Huguenots in Spitalfields, east London, might nowadays be close to the homes of millionaire artists including Tracey Emin and Gilbert and George (and of Cruickshank himself, though he doesn’t say so) but these French Protestants, fleeing Louis XIV, were only the first wave of embattled immigrants on the premises. It was later a synagogue, now abandoned. “It takes only a little imagination to fill its shadowy corners with spectres, and it’s hard not to strain to hear the voices of the long dead.”The English House: A History in Eight Buildings by Dan Cruickshank is published by Hutchinson Heinemann, £26.

Reminiscent of Neel Mukherjee’s dazzling circular depiction of Indian inequalities,A State of Freedom, it’s a keenly anticipated follow-up to the acclaimed short-story collection with which he made his debut in 2009,In Other Rooms, Other Wonders– also portraying overlapping worlds of Pakistani class and culture.We begin in the squalor and bustle of a Rawalpindi bazaar in the 1950s, where the heartbreaking figure of a small child, abandoned to his fate and clutching a pair of plastic shoes, is scooped under the protection of a tea stall owner. He proceeds to raise the boy as his own son, having only daughters, but Yazid is also adopted by the stall’s garrulous regulars, who teach him both to read and to pay keen attention to the currents of class, wealth and power which flow past him every day.Loved, popular, clever, Yazid grows into a bull of a teenager with keen entrepreneurial instincts; he soon makes the tea stall, and his shack behind it, the cool place for a gang of privileged schoolboys to hang out, smoke and play games. From among this group he wins a scholarly, adoring friend, Zain. Zain’s intellectual, leftwing family take him to their heart and Yazid is soon smitten by his sister, Yasmin, with devastating consequences that catapult him out of all his small, hard-won securities and into the service of an army colonel and politician in distant Lahore.Mueenuddin brings the smells and tastes of Pakistan to vibrant lifeMueenuddin then moves us to the deep countryside, where the colonel’s nephew Rustom, who has returned from a long spell studying in America, must negotiate local webs of corruption and violence as he attempts to revive the fortunes of the estate neglected by his late playboy father. His time in the US has softened him, apparently, and the gentle, democratic instincts he has acquired there are no match for the rotten local police or the tribe of gangsters who have long been his family’s enforcers and whose help he rashly asks for when a boundary dispute threatens to escalate. In Lahore to ask advice, and plead his case with relatives when thegoondasget out of hand, he falls under the spell of his rich older cousin, Hisham, who has also been educated in America, and his equally glamorous wife. They treat him like a kind of hapless pet and are soon matchmaking for him.Next we are inside the head of Hisham and find the queasy truths behind the polished front and impeccable marriage. Mueenuddin compellingly portrays the backstory to his relationship with queenly, worldly Shahnaz. Hisham and his adored, more studious brother are the sons of the colonel who took young Yazid into his household; they are sent to university in America, where it’s the brother who initially falls for Shahnaz. Hisham is the one with the killer instinct, and the fact that she is seduced by this, as though sensing a kindred spirit, colours indelibly the marriage that follows. Every detail is noted and tucked away by Yazid, who has been feudally handed down from the colonel as the couple’s muscle and fearless chauffeur, and equally by Saquib, a poor boy from the village, now mentored by Yazid and effectively sponsored by the childless Hisham and Shahnaz as a risky mixture of servant and project.The novel’s final section, in effect the fourth interlinked novella, comes full circle by homing in on this Saquib and how he repays the support first of Yazid and then of the wealthy employers who are charmed by his quick wit and natural elegance. This section is the most reminiscent of Mukherjee in its juxtaposition of wit and brutality, and its savagely sudden closing down of prospects.Mueenuddin’s writing is always fluent and often very funny. He brings the smells and tastes of Pakistan to vibrant life; the birds and trees feel as present as the weight of history and the impossible tangles within tangles of corruption and responsibility. The novel begins with a long list of major and minor characters, as in some editions of Dickens or early English translations of the great Russian novelists, but any fears of overcomplexity this raises are quite unfounded; the names may be grand and long but the portrayals are immediate and never confusing, the storytelling as instantly involving as anything by Amor Towles.If I had a criticism it would be that the four narratives give no space to a female outlook. The women – Yazid’s adored Yasmin, Rustom’s girlfriend in America, ruthless Shahnaz and Saquib’s ambiguous young wife, Gazala – ultimately all retain their secrets from the reader. Nothing in Mueenuddin’s supremely controlled writing is accidental, and his superb short stories repeatedly come from female perspectives, so perhaps he is tantalising us to make a point about a culture in which the male voice dominates. And this is a minor quibble born of being greedy for more; This Is Where the Serpent Lives looks set to be one of the standout novels of 2026.Patrick Gale’s new novel, Love Lane, comes out in March.

And also, the knowledge that this game was made withthe help of generative AIvoice acting makes me slightly ashamed of how much I enjoy it.

In it, you play as a raider in post-apocalyptic Italy, living underground but regularly heading topside to scrounge for supplies, after a massive ecological event destroyed human civilisation and strange autonomous robots showed up shortly afterwards to scour the scarred landscape. These ARC can fly overhead, roll around on the ground, or leap extraordinary distances on four mechanical legs. Each is uniquely deadly.You are woefully inadequate in a battle against most of Arc Raiders’ enemies, which means you’ll need to scurry around to avoid them, throw noisemakers to distract them, or attack as a team, with either the squad you deployed alongside or other players you convince to join you over chat. All of this is in service of the game’s one true god: loot, which you need in order to perform everything from repairing your weapons to crafting medical supplies to training your pet rooster so he can fetch items for you on the surface. And you can only keep what you successfully escape with, so if you die mid-match or fail to get to an elevator or metro car before the timer runs out, it’s all gone.Though my first few rounds of Arc Raiders were supremely difficult and punishing (in my third match, I found several pieces of rare loot and was then ruthlessly murdered by a squad all clad in red), Embark has ensured that you can make progress fast. You can upgrade your raider’s mobility, stamina and stealthiness every time you level up, and you can earn experience through playing rounds and successfully extracting. You can recycle things into crafting materials to upgrade your weapons and shield, or sell trinkets to merchants for extra cash that will help you buy better equipment. Even after a bad round, you still getsomewhere.After every successful extraction, I want to jump right back in for more. I want more close calls, accidental explosions and terrifying sprints through ruined cities. I want to hurl more expletives over chat so that other squads know I’m in the thick of it, walk past another player blastingA Thousand Miles by Vanessa Carltonthrough their microphone, usher another half-dozen more people into an elevator hatch before I press the button to close the door at the last second.Arc Raiders isn’t just fun to play.

Kwok/The GuardianHong Kong‘They want to destroy my career’: Kiwi Chow on life as a dissenting director in Hong KongWith his new film rejected by official censors, the award-winning film-maker says he is being punished for his outspoken viewsAmy HawkinsSenior China correspondentMon 29 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 01.23 ESTShareIn Hong Kong, wheredissent is now characterised by silence, few dare openly criticise the government or the Chinese Communist party (CCP) that controls it. Film-maker Kiwi Chow is one of the few.“The Chinese Communist party’s practice is to try and destroy history and truth,” the 46-year-old director says from his home in the region. “It’s ridiculous that I can still live inHong Kongwithout being in jail.”In a society where someone can bejailed for wearing a “seditious” T-shirt, his surprise is understandable.Chow is best known for co-directingthe 2015 dystopian anthology film Ten Years, which imagined a future Hong Kong under the increasing influence of the CCP, and forRevolution of Our Times, his award-winning 2021 documentaryabout Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests.His latest film, Deadline, is about high school students haunted by threats of suicide in an environment of intense academic pressure. Chow says this has long been a problem in Hong Kong, but has been made worse bythe region’s new national security regime.Chow can still live in Hong Kong, and many of his films have been successful there, but his outspoken political views and works are making life increasingly difficult for him..On 12 December, Hong Kong’s film censorship authority refused to grant approval for Deadline to be released, citing national security concerns. In a statement released after the refusal, Chow said that he would not appeal the decision, because doing so would be “futile”.He added: “This film is the hard work and dedication from so many people – the investors, the actors, and the crew. It is heartbreaking to all of us. When confronted with injustice and absurdity, we feel helpless, and anger seems to be inevitable … In response to this the unfair judgement, my reaction is: I will stick to my filming path.”Shelly Kraicer, an independent cinema curator specialising in Chinese film, says it is striking that Chow “doesn’t shy away from addressing quite directly the political constraints that he perceives he’s under”.Much of Chow’s work deals with the upheavals that have shaped his home region. Most recently, the aftermath of theWang Fuk Court fire, which killed at least 160 people in November, has broughtfurther state pressure on dissent.Less than a fortnight after the blaze, Hong Kong held“patriots only” legislative council elections, with only candidates vetted by the government allowed to stand. With Hongkongers reeling from the tragedy, and questions swirling about government accountability, the only way to safely voice dissent was by not voting. Turnout was at a near-record low of 31.9%.Chow was one of the people who did not vote, but he has also been vocally critical of the government’s handling of the disaster.“With collusion between officials and businesses, shoddy workmanship, lax oversight, rampant corruption and an unbalanced system, Hong Kong could not uphold professional standards,” he has said. “How long must Hong Kong endure this?”The construction company that was doing renovation work on the compound at the time of the fire has not commented publicly on the tragedy. The consultancy in charge of the renovations reportedly closed down in the weeks after the fire. Directors from both of the firms have been arrested.A Hong Kong government spokesperson said authorities were “going all out” to investigate the cause of the fire, and that several people had already been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.The fire was the biggest test of Beijing’s grip on Hong Kong since the 2019-20 pro-democracy protests, which were ultimately quelled by the imposition of a fierce national security law. The first sign that Chow was not going to be silenced by this came in 2021, when he released Revolution of Our Times, a two-and-a-half-hour documentary filmed from the frontlines of the protests.The film, which premiered at the Cannes film festival, took its name from thebanned protest slogan: “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time”.Now Chow’s latest film, which stars the legendary Hong Kong actor Anthony Wong, has in effect been banned from public screening.In theory, Deadline, which was filmed inTaiwanand partly funded by the government there, isn’t as politically sensitive as his earlier works. Set in an unnamed Asian city, it tells the story of an elite private school where students buckle under the heat of intense academic competition. It was released in Taiwan on 7 November.But Chow believes the authorities are trying to make an example of him personally by refusing to grant approval for the film. “They don’t want to arrest me, but they want to destroy my creative career,” he said.Hong Kong’s Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration said it would not comment on the approval process for individual films.Kraicer said Hong Kong authorities “seem to be more interested in controlling what kinds of films get shown there rather than controlling the film-makers themselves”.View image in fullscreenPro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong in 2019.Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty ImagesDeadline deals with themes that are common across east Asia. But Chow believes the pressure on teachers and students is even more intense in Hong Kong, wherenational security is now part of the curriculum.“What happens when history, society and truth need to be distorted in school?. Teachers can’t talk about it, students can’t talk about it. They feel that despite what’s happening in society, the truth is distorted.”He adds that in the course of his research for Deadline, he spoke to a physical education teacher who was struggling with how to incorporate national security elements into his sports lessons.The official response to the Wang Fuk Court fire reflects Hong Kong’s new national security-focused era. Several people were arrested for alleged national security offences in the days after the blaze, includinga student who started an online petition calling for government accountability.On 15 December, a court in Hong Kong found the pro-democracy activist and publisher Jimmy Laiguilty on national security offences, in the most high profile case the city has seen since the imposition of the law in 2020.But Chow remains undaunted. He thinks the authorities are unlikely to arrest him, lest they bring more attention to his films. He concedes it could still happen, though. He’s discussed the possibility with his wife and says he would rather use his freedom to speak out while he can.“Even if we left Hong Kong, the fear would linger,” he says, referring to Beijing’s increasing practices of targeting critics overseas. Instead, he says, “I want to stay in Hong Kong and get used to living with fear.”Additional research by Ching WongExplore more on these topicsHong KongChinaHong Kong apartment firesTaiwanAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But scheduling it makes it feel like a chore. And unlike any other chore or fitness enterprise, you conceive it more as self-indulgence than self-improvement, and as such, even if you’re already in a relationship, it’s hard to find that chin-out determination to get it done. Yet sex is an appetite like any other, a necessity like any other, a nourishment like any other. If you let it go dormant the effect on your relationship might be as if one or both of you are on a permanent diet – and also lonely. That might be fine for both of you, but for many of us, sex is a thing worth prioritising.At its core, before you introduce any other domestic obstacles, it’s a two-person job, so you have to be attuned to one another; you can’t just decide unilaterally. To take this in ascending order of hurdles; if you’re a childless couple, the main block is going to be each other – not being in the same mood at the same time, not being in the house at the same time. This is true for your entire relationship, not just sex; I once interviewed a fertility doctor, who described working with a couple, trying to find an appointment time for when one was ovulating and both were in the country. They scrolled through several weeks before they managed it. “I felt as if I was beginning to get to the bottom of why they couldn’t conceive,” she said.Sex does not have to begin and end in the bedroom, says Michelle Bassam, a psychological and sexual therapist of 25 years’ standing: “You can maintain intimacy throughout the day by being tactile. Showing interest in your partner can be enough.” And of course, the flip side – not showing interest, never giving your partner your full attention, never touching them unless, Larry David-style, it’s because you want sex in the next 90 seconds – can also derail things.View image in fullscreen‘Make sure the workload is equal.’Photograph: Posed by models; Alina Rudya/Bell Collective/Getty ImagesObviously, having small kids is the passion-killer people fixate on, because it’s the most precipitous decline. One minute you were two hot people, shagging whenever you felt like it, then, wham! – you’re always tired, you’re boiling with resentment, you may have a toddler in your bed, and on the rare occasions you’re both awake at the same time without distraction, you might not be in the mood. Plus, a crisis of body image and identity, all might rush at the relationship. “It’s considered a really risky time, for couples,” says Jodie Slee, a sex therapist of 16 years, says, “not just sexually.” But start by being practical. Slee gives this staggering statistic: “If a woman gets an extra hour of sleep a night, that increases her libido by 14%.”The body image consideration is real: “Motherhood is not seen as a sexy thing,” Slee says. Realistically, this lands on women, who go through a physical ordeal that puts you off sex, makes you look crumpled and smell a bit like dairy for who knows how many months afterwards, and puts you in a new category, “mother”, that culturally isn’t even allowed a sexual identity. “I think it’s OK for women to be a little bit selfish, and think: ‘I’m going to have a little bit of time to keep me in my pre-child self.’”But everyone, child-bearing or not, needs to acknowledge how much has changed, and the pain there may be in that. Build a network so there are people you are happy to leave the kids with overnight; don’t let a sex drought, some of which will be physically inevitable, turn into a black hole that you tiptoe around; don’t mediate other resentments through sex, by withdrawing physically because of the one million other non-sexual things there are to be annoyed about.“Make sure the workload is equal,” Slee says, “so that one person is not doing all the night feeds and the labour. I think it’s OK for parents to be a little bit selfish, and not have this martyr approach to parenting, so the children get every single bit of you.”As kids get older, and become teenagers, their demands on your time are probably fewer, but there’s often a layer of self-consciousness. “Parents have a responsibility, one would hope, to hide the bedroom side of things,” Bassam says, “But it’s very important that children and young teenagers are given a template from their parents, so they know what intimacy is. It can be as simple as someone putting a hand on your shoulder as they walk through the kitchen.”View image in fullscreen‘Novelty is the thing that creates the honeymoon period.’Photograph: Posed by models; Kathrin Ziegler/Getty ImagesThose child-rearing years, though, are no longer the end of the obstacle race. The number ofyoung adults still living with their parents has increasedby more than a third this century. “So many people don’t like to have sex at their parent’s house,” Bassam says – a situation often aggravated by displaying family photographs in the spare room.It’s also a fact that a certain natural prudery makes us much more comfortable asking others to accommodate dietary or habit preferences than we are asking to just have half an hour upstairs, for the love of God. People will move mountains for you if you’re gluten intolerant, and they’ll roll their eyes but accept it if you meditate, but you cannot say, “both of us are just going to disappear for a bit”.This holds for any multi-occupant household: you have to communicate your expectations in the you-as-a-couple sphere. If you feel like your couplehood is being constantly obliterated by a group’s demands, that’s going to make you not want sex, or alternatively, want sex in a needy, annoying way that isn’t erotic.There’s a truism that once you start scheduling sex, you’re doomed, but not everyone agrees. “If you reframe it,” Slee says, “you’re not scheduling, you’re prioritising, and you’re showing one another that it’s important.” In long-term relationships, “your desire is more responsive than it is spontaneous; so if you’re waiting for the mood to spontaneously take you, you could be waiting a really long time.”Planning for sex also “stops the pressure of ‘Oh my God, it’s been two weeks, it’s been three weeks’. The more pressure there is, the more anxiety there is, the less likely it is to happen.”Now you just have to keep the flame alive, which is done by what people used to call “erotic defamiliarisation”, which was just a science-y term for novelty. “Novelty is the thing that creates the honeymoon period – your body is flooded with dopamine, which is spiked by novelty. Over time, your body gets used to that much dopamine and there is no novelty,” Slee says. “That doesn’t have to mean dungeons and sex clubs and swinging – that’s what people think you mean when you say it, and itcanbe that. But novelty for some couples will be using a different room, wearing a different outfit.” The advantage of being familiar to one another is that you’re allowed to try something that doesn’t work. Even a misfire will show that you’re on your partner’s agenda.The first couple Slee ever worked with were in their early 80s and had been together for 50 years. They were having sex every other day, “they were only in therapy because they wanted to spice it up – and it was already pretty spicy. One of them had had a hip replacement, so there were some new limitations,” but a sex drought wasn’t one of them. I guess we’re including them as the motivational ideal for a long and happy marriage, but also, it wasn’t magic, they just got there somehow: they never let the sun (or two suns) go down on a dry spell.Explore more on these topicsSexHow to have a better dayRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photographers reflect on the moments behind the picturesBySarah GilbertandEmine SanerMon 29 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTShareTai Po, Hong Kong, China, 26 NovemberView image in fullscreenA man cries out in distress as a fire spreads across multiple buildings on a housing estate in Hong KongTyrone Siu/ReutersA massive fire broke out around 3pm at Wang Fuk Court, a densely packed housing estate in Tai Po, and I arrived about an hour later. By then, the flames were raging across multiple blocks, with thick black smoke. Unsafe bamboo scaffolding and foam may have led to what became Hong Kong’s worst fire in decades. Residents were streaming out in panic, while emergency crews fought a losing battle against the inferno spreading from one tower to the next.It felt like a nightmare unfolding. Outside the cordon line, I saw crowds of nearby residents and this 71-year-old man, Mr Wong. He was pacing near the barrier, his face crumpled in agony. This photo captures his pure desperation, shouting that his wife was trapped in the blaze, yelling the apartment number to police officers in the hope they could reach her. He had last spoken to her in a phone call when the fire broke out.In the days afterwards, I couldn’t stop thinking about Mr Wong and his wife. I searched for updates, hoping for good news. Three days after the fire, while shooting near the site again, I spotted him across the road. I reintroduced myself as the photographer, and he said he’d seen my photo everywhere, then pointed to his son behind him. His son said something that struck me deeply: “I thought the home was no more, but home is still here.” His mother had left them, the apartment was ash, but his father, his sister and the rest of his family were together.Neko Harbour, Antarctica, 22 FebruaryView image in fullscreenA humpback whale breaks the surface, surrounded by ice, after a dive forkrill in AntarcticaRoie GalitzI was in Neko Harbour, guiding an expedition of photography enthusiasts. There were more than 20 humpback whales swimming around that morning, which was towards the end of the 18-day trip. Some were sleeping, some were feeding. There were a lot of little growlers – small chunks of ice calved from the nearby glacier – that were floating around, and I saw one whale swimming towards there, so I flew my drone up to capture the image. When the whale came up to breathe, the ice was pushed away, and it created this shape of a flower, which I found fascinating.What I find encouraging is that we have been seeing an increase in whales, especially humpbacks, which were once hunted to the brink of extinction. The whales here are migratory and come to the Antarctic in summer to feed – there are more than 500m metric tons of krill in the Antarctic Ocean, although there are threats from krill harvesting vessels.Humpback whales are extraordinary creatures. They are in the genusMegaptera, which means huge wings. One of the things I like about this photo is you can see the size of them.New York City, USA,5 NovemberView image in fullscreenA man celebrates at an election night party forNew York City mayorZohran MamdaniShannon Stapleton/ReutersI’ve been fortunate to cover a lot of campaign politics, so for me, Zohran Mamdani’s election night party was kind of a standard night, but at a really beautiful theatre, the Paramount in Brooklyn. The energy was palpable and I think everybody thought it was a foregone conclusion that he was going to win. It was called just after 9.30pm.Mamdani really tapped into social media and reaching out to a younger and diverse audience. I think that had a lot to do with him getting elected, and you could see that reflected in the crowd.Whenever I go into one of these things, I try to pick out faces before I shoot and then hover around where I think something is going to happen. I look for body language, excitement, T-shirts with logos, hats. I was drawn to this guy’s “Jews for Zohran” hat and scarf, which has a cool logo.An hour or so later, Mamdani walked on stage. I covered Barack Obama a lot when he was running, and those events were always full of incredible emotion and passion, and joy at times. I felt that same kind of energy on this night.Kathmandu, Nepal,9 SeptemberView image in fullscreenProtesters take selfies at the Singha Durbar government complex, after it was set on fireNiranjanShrestha/APAnti-corruption protests had erupted the day before, sparked by the government’s ban on social media, and were largely organised by young people, so they became known as the gen Z protests. Many protesters were killed by armed police.That day was terrible. I was covering the protest in front of the parliament and I witnessed lots of shooting – I almost got shot in the chest. I was standing with a photojournalist friend, and a live bullet passed between us. Within a few seconds, he was hit by a rubber bullet in the back of his head, and blood was streaming out from his neck. Along with other colleagues, we carried him to an ambulance. Many young people had been killed, and there was a lot of anger and grief at the bloodshed, which grew throughout the night.It felt like a revolution had started. The following day ended with people looting and burning buildings, including prisons, shopping centres and hotels. The prime minister KP Sharma Oli resigned and fled.Protesters set fire to the offices of political parties, then soon after government buildings including the supreme court, and the building in this picture, the Singha Durbar. Like many others who had gathered there to express their anger, fear and frustration, these boys were present, not as instigators, but as witnesses. It was very chaotic, but there was also excitement that these buildings were on fire, a way of expressing the anger about the violence aimed at protesters the previous day. These boys decided to do a selfie and I just captured it.New York City, USA, 20 AugustView image in fullscreenA security guard breaks down after anEcuadorianman is detained by ICE, leaving his wife and children distraughtCarol GuzyFor more than five months, I’ve been going every day to Federal Plaza and covering the detainments by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the family separations are by far the most heart-wrenching. This was a late afternoon. Normally we’re able to travel up and down the halls, but this time they blocked the halls. I’m pretty sure it’s because they knew it was going to be a bad family separation.The father of this family from Ecuador was detained. I didn’t see what happened, but the mother immediately started screaming and the kids were crying. As he was led away, she was saying: “Please help me. Take me too.”I followed her out of the building. She was with a court observer who was trying to help her, who then went back into the building because the woman’s husband had their house keys and she wouldn’t have been able to get home. I stayed with her, and I called my Spanish-speaking friend to talk to her.The security guard came over, to see what he could do. He was overcome, because the family were just in inconsolable despair. It’s not usual for security guards to act like this and I was surprised that he showed this humanity. They’re more likely to be reserved and do their job, and it was so touching to witness him breaking down too. I’ve talked to him since, and he’s proud that he was a human being in that moment, not just a security guard.I try to report everything fairly, and I’m respectful to everyone, including the ICE agents, but of course, personally, the detainments feel soul-crushing, especially the family separations. I think these children will be traumatised forever by what happened, especially if they never get their dad back.Dayr Atiyah, Syria, 5 JanuaryView image in fullscreenA statue of the late Syrian presidentHafez Assadis destroyedLeo Correa/API had been on assignment in the Homs region with colleagues, and we were driving back to Damascus. The town of Dayr Atiyah is about halfway and until a month earlier a huge statue of the former president Hafez al-Assad had stood on a mount overlooking the town. Over just a few days in December 2024, a rebel offensive had ended the 53-year Assad authoritarian rule and ousted the president Bashar al-Assad. Celebrating the end of the regime, symbols of the Assads’ power were toppled across the country. This had been the biggest statue of Hafez al-Assad.When we arrived, a member of the new security forces did turn up to see what we were doing, but nobody else was there. We were there for about half an hour, looking around the derelict site. There is a beautiful view of the town and surrounding mountains.The way people had pulled down this huge monument felt very powerful, representing a significant moment in this country of people taking power, and hopefully of peace. As a photographer working in the region, to be able to see these places feels like living history. Around the country, places have been destroyed after years of civil war. A toppled statue of a repressive leader is an important symbol of what’s happening in Syria, and the need to rebuild the country.Virginia, USA,29 NovemberView image in fullscreenA drunkraccoonpasses out in a bathroomSamantha Martin/APOne night in late November, a liquor store in the small town of Ashland, Hanover County, was broken into. Bottles of alcohol were pulled off shelves and smashed, their contents consumed. Officials on the scene found the perpetrator passed out in the shop’s bathroom – a raccoon. He was, they say, “very intoxicated”.There are signs that the raccoon is a serial offender. Samantha Martin, an animal protection officer, suspects he was responsible for breaking into a karate studio, and the offices of the Department of Motor Vehicles, where he “ate some of their snacks”.Of his liquor store raid, Martin said: “I did see his eyes going back and forth like a typical drunk person, and he obviously could not stand up.” She was able to take him to a shelter, “in order to sober up a little bit”. Then he was released back into the wild. The story went viral, and people donated money to the shelter. It was so relatable, she said. “Everybody’s had a few extra and passed out by the toilet, and hopes somebody can come get you the next morning.”Chicago, USA, 19 SeptemberView image in fullscreenRev David Black is pepper-sprayedduring a demonstration outside an ICE facilityAshlee Rezin/Sun Chicago TimesOperation Midway Blitz was a sweep by ICE, supposedly of “illegal” immigrants. When it began,the community in Chicago started organising on Fridays outside an ICE facility in suburban Broadview, protesting and trying to block the agents’ vehicles as they were coming and going.Throughout the day, the federal agents had been using non-lethal ammunition against the mostly peaceful protesters. All the photojournalists on our team have hostile environment training, and carry respirators, goggles, helmets, bulletproof vests and more.Reverend David Black approached the sidewalk with his hands raised. Agents were positioned on the roof above with pepper ball guns. He was struck on the head.Other protesters came over to him, grabbed him and pulled him away from the area. He was yelling and upset. Within a few minutes, a vehicle was leaving the facility. The gates opened, and a dozen or so agents came out to escort it and lined up outside the gates. Then, they advanced on the protesters – that’s when one of them sprayed Rev Black with pepper spray.ICE made several arrests that day. It was chaotic. Weeks later, a fence was erected to prevent protesters’ access to the front of the facility and the Illinois state police took over crowd control. In my experience as a photojournalist, I’ve never seen Chicago police or other local law enforcement agencies use non-lethal munitions at this level.South Dakota, USA, 28 JuneView image in fullscreenA tornado rages on in South DakotaTy NewcombI wanted to go storm chasing, so I reached out to fellow photographer, and storm chaser, Paige Vincent, who has a lot of experience. We started hanging out and going on storm chases, starting in April when the storm season in the US starts to kick up. This season, we were successfully able to intercept 18 tornadoes.This one near Clear Lake in South Dakota was the best. It was strange, because normally when tornadoes are about to dissipate, they do that rope-out phase, and they get really skinny, and usually wobble around. Most of the time that breaks up the vortex. But this one was odd because it started out that way, then it actually gained momentum and strength, and turned into a strong EF3 tornado. It sounds like a freight train, a whooshing, or like a low drum. It’s unsettling, for sure. I think it hit a small farmhouse, but luckily there were no major injuries.We were less than a quarter of a mile away – which is a dangerous place, because it can take a left turn towards you really quickly. That’s why I was shooting from the car, because you have to be able to get out of the way in seconds.I love the thrill of the chase, and being able to take photos and videos that help understand how tornadoes work. By better understanding these storms and documenting them, we’ll be able to better protect people.Twickenham, UK, 27 SeptemberView image in fullscreenHannah Bottermancelebrates after EnglandwintheWomen’s Rugby World CupMorgan Harlow/Getty ImagesEngland’s women had just beaten Canada to win the Rugby World Cup and it was an incredible moment. I had covered the tournament and had behind-the-scenes access. It was a while after the final whistle that they all came back to the changing room, after greeting fans and all the trophy lifts. There were lots of mixed emotions. Some players were sitting down, taking it all in, some were up dancing. It wasn’t until the rest of the team came into the changing room a couple minutes after that they started to really celebrate properly.They were popping champagne and it was going everywhere. There was music, lots of dancing, confetti, champagne on the floor. It was all a mess, but a fun mess. I knew the prop Hannah Botterman was known for doing a knee slide, and I think everyone knew, once the floor was slippy, that she probably would.This was her third slide. I was standing next to her when she did the first two, then I saw her grab the trophy, and I thought this was going to be the moment, so I had to run and get into the right spot, and just hope she came straight towards me. She did, with the trophy, and a pair of sunglasses. Hannah is a bold personality and what you see is what you get. This picture just sums her up, and the team winning in style.Kolyuchin Island, offChukotka, Russia, 18 SeptemberView image in fullscreenA polar bear relaxes at an abandoned research station on Kolyuchin IslandVadimMakhorov/API was travelling across the sea around Chukotka. On the way to Wrangel Island we stopped by Kolyuchin Island. By September, the sea ice has melted, so polar bears are forced to spend some time on land and most of them were using the abandoned polar research station there as shelter. I spotted them by drone, and counted about 20. We visited Kolyuchin Island twice along the route, so I ended up filming the bears over the course of two days.They had temporarily settled into these little buildings. This bear is relaxing on the porch of one. They hunt on the ice, but they had to wait for new ice to form, so they simply waited, using these buildings as protection from wind and rain. I didn’t notice any conflict between them.It would have been too dangerous to go ashore, so I stayed on the ship and filmed with the drone. I often film wildlife with a drone, including polar bears, so I know how to fly in a way that doesn’t frighten the animals or cause them any harm.The bears’ reaction was simple curiosity. Since I approached very slowly and gave them time to get used to it, they either didn’t notice it at all or found it interesting. To them, the drone was just another noisy bird.Off Lanzarote,6 JanuaryView image in fullscreenMigrants on a boat surround a woman who has just given birthSalvamento MaritimoOn board a crowded boat, as 60 people made the deadly Atlantic crossing from the north-west African coast to the Canary Islands, a baby boy was born. When the sea rescue service, Salvamento Maritimo, reached them, he was about 20 minutes old. The rescue crew knew that a pregnant woman was among the people on the boat, including 13 other women and three children, but not that she had given birth. Domingo Trujillo, the captain of the search and rescue vessel, told Spain’s state broadcaster TVE that the mother was lying on the floor of the crowded boat, and someone was holding the baby. “I covered him up, took him here [to my chest] and patted him so he would stop crying,” said Trujillo. The mother and baby were transferred to hospital by helicopter.As of early December, 17,000 migrants arrived in the Canaries by sea – significantly lower than 2024, as immigration patrols stepped up – and it remains a perilous journey. Last year, more than 10,000 people died while trying to reach Spain by sea.AlUla, Saudi Arabia, 27 JanuaryView image in fullscreenA woman takes a photograph in front of the Maraya, the world’s largest mirrored building, in AlUlaLoic Venance/AFPI was covering the AlUla Tour cycling race, and one of the stages was scheduled to start from this building. Called Maraya – Arabic for “mirror” – it’s a large events venue, and the world’s biggest mirrored building, set in a beautiful desert landscape.A couple of days before the start of the stage, I went to have a look so I could work out where best to position myself on the day. In the desert, the light during the day is very hard, so I went later on. When I arrived, there were still a lot of tourists visiting the building, but most left just before sunset. But that was when the light and the reflections were magical.The Maraya could be almost invisible, depending on the point of view. I was turning around to shoot when I saw this woman. She was taking a selfie in the sunset, with the mirror reflection creating a continuous landscape. It looked so curious – if you look quickly, you might think there are two different people. It takes a moment to understand it.Istanbul, Turkey, 23 MarchView image in fullscreenA protester wearing a gas mask is pepper-sprayed during a clash with police inIstanbulChris McGrath/Getty ImagesEkrem İmamoğlu, the mayor of Istanbul and the main political rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was arrested on corruption charges, which was seen by some as politically motivated. Protesters started gathering, and police became more and more heavy-handed with them.There were several days and nights of clashes. There’s a famous aqueduct in Istanbul that blocks a road that goes into the city centre, and so the police set up under it as a natural barricade. As the protesters tried to move down this road, the police were using pepper spray if they got too close.Lots of protesters wore masks, and I noticed this man dressed as a dervish. I could see straight away what the picture was – silent resistance, with the spectre of the police in the background. The police lights had lit up the place, and when they sprayed him with pepper spray, it became a resistance picture. I don’t think he was genuinely part of the Sufi order; I think he was a protester who decided to use this traditional dress as a way of showing resistance. Sufism is all about the values of love and service. Then to have the gas mask on was extremely unusual.Once he got sprayed, he walked back into the crowd of protesters, and I didn’t see him again. The protest went on into the early hours, until the police decided to clear them out, and would rush them until they all dispersed.Gaza, 21 JulyView image in fullscreenA woman cradles her emaciated child in GazaAhmed al-AriniI’ve covered the war on Gaza from the beginning. For two years I have been living in Gaza under displacement, killing and devastation. My family and I have lost everything, and we are still here. My work is filled with hardship – danger, hunger and the absence of any real shelter. You walk between rubble and destroyed buildings, through neighbourhoods erased from existence.There is a hunger war, and the bodies of Palestinians in Gaza have become frail and emaciated, and children’s bodies have turned into skeletal frames. This boy, Muhammad, is a year and a half. His mother was living in a tent built inside the ruins of a destroyed building in Gaza City. She had no food, no baby formula, no nappies. Everything around her reflected the dire situation that Palestinian families were enduring. They had endured displacement and repeated evacuation from one area to another. Her husband had been killed during the war, leaving her alone with two children.When I first arrived at the tent, she wasn’t there. She had gone out searching for food – anything they could eat. She returned empty-handed – prices on the hidden market were unimaginable. She had no source of income, like most families in the Gaza Strip. Muhammad was in a very dire state. He was lying on the ground, crying. I was shocked by how thin he was – his body had turned into a skeleton.Making this photograph had aprofound impact on me. I was exhausted and had not eaten since morning. I couldn’t hold myself together when I saw him. I said to myself, this image must reach the world so they can see what is happening. I want to show the world that an entire population is besieged, starved and subjected to the machinery of killing and destruction. The world must look at our suffering. Our lives have turned into hell.After publication of this image, information came to light that Muhammad is extra vulnerable due to pre-existing health conditions and was suffering without access to sufficient food and nutritional supplements. Many experts say that in a hunger crisis, children and those with existing medical conditions are among those most at risk.Pavlohrad, Dnipro, Ukraine,19 JulyView image in fullscreenUkrainian soldiers fire an anti-aircraft auto-cannon atRussian dronesin afield of sunflowersRoman Pilipey/AFPWe spent the night with the 59th brigade air defence unit, during the biggest air attack on Pavlohrad. This unit was one of several others working. They just happened to stop in this sunflower field because it was the best location to watch and wait for Russian drones, packed with explosives, to fly over.This photograph was taken at about 1am. The unit uses a Soviet anti-aircraft auto-cannon on the vehicle. It’s old, and hard to operate and to hit drones – especially the new drones that Russia is using, which can fly higher. The machine also gets stuck, because it’s old. It stopped working, and they were trying to repair it on the spot, while drones were still flying. While it was being fixed, some of the soldiers were using old AK-47 machine guns to try to shoot down drones.The cannon is not able to hit many drones per night. Usually it’s a small number, but even if they hit just one drone, that can save lives. They were firing from after midnight to about 5am. In the morning, when the drones were flying lower, the soldiers were firing at them again with machine guns.It’s a hard job. The soldiers sleep rarely, because they are always on standby, and drones also attack during the day. But they keep focused.La Paz, Bolivia, 4 DecemberView image in fullscreenA woman flies over her opponentin a Boliviancholitawrestling matchJuan Ignacio Roncoroni/AFPIn this wrestling match, Yolandita Jr has just propelled herself off the ropes and flies over her opponent, Nayel La Bonita, who is on the ground. The shows are theatrical, and contain humour and acting, and each fighter embodies a different character. Normally in every fight, you have the “good” fighter and the “bad” one.Cholita wrestling began around 20 years ago and matches now occur in several venues around La Paz. They have become a tourist attraction. I was on a different assignment, but this match caught my attention and I went to see it. This photograph was taken from a balcony on the upper floor.The term “chola” was once a derogatory name for indigenous Aymara and Quechua women, who have been historically marginalised and discriminated against. The wrestling cholitas are an expression of indigenous pride, reclaiming the name, along with the traditional dress of colourful voluminous skirts, shawls and bowler hats.Allahabad, India, 29 JanuaryView image in fullscreenHindu holy men take a bathin the GangesElke Scholiers/Getty ImagesThe spiritual bathing ritual in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj’s river banks taken by the Naga Sadhus, or Hindu holy men, to absolve sins and obtain moksha (freedom from the cycle of birth, death and rebirth) at this year’s Kumbh Mela had already been postponed for around 12 hours. In the early hours of the morning, there had been a stampede, in which more than 40 people had died. The atmosphere was tense because many people’s relatives were still missing, or their family members were fighting for their lives in the hospital. At the same time, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath posted on X that that the holy baths happened peacefully and authorities continued to underplay the situation hours after it occurred. There were more than 400 million attendees in six weeks - despite severe security concerns.I had arrived as the stampede was unfolding around 1.30am. I saw bodies lying on the ground. It was chaotic and dangerous. More stampedes were happening. The first aid team were angry at us for photographing dead bodies, but many bereaved relatives wanted a document of what was happening.This picture happened at a time when the head of the holy men decided at the last minute to jump into the water. I was in the water for 30 minutes before the Naga Sadhus jumped in. They dipped their hair and naked bodies in the water in groups, around 10 to 15 minutes each, multiple times. Some of them enjoy the media attention. There was no panic among them – this purification ritual is one of the most important events of their year.Odesa, Ukraine,11 JulyView image in fullscreenA woman hugs her horse after it’s killed in aRussian drone attackDavid Guttenfelder/NYT/Redux/eyevineI’d gone to cover the return of the remains of Ukrainians who had been killed in action. While I was there, there was a wave of Russian long-range drone attacks. We heard the explosions, and I could see smoke rising from a neighbourhood.They had targeted a military recruitment centre, and at least one of the drones had exploded in the residential area next to it, where there was a stable. The place was on fire. Before I arrived, people had smashed down a wall and were freeing horses, dragging them out. Some of them were injured and needed medical attention.When I arrived, all that was left was this smouldering block. A 20-year-old horse named Kamelia had been killed. The owner of the stable and horse, Yulia, had climbed through the rubble and she knelt, weeping and holding the horse in her arms. Someone handed her a knife, and she cut a lock of the horse’s mane and put it in her pocket.In war zones, we focus on the effect on humans, but animals – especially our pets – are also affected. I remember seeing, at the beginning of the war, refugees crossing the border into Poland and so many of them had cages with cats, or a puppy in their backpack. That’s something we can all relate to, but we don’t often permit ourselves to feel that, because the scale of the suffering of people in a war zone is so dramatic.Photographers’ images of the war are meant to make an impact, but year on year, sometimes, our images go unnoticed. Maybe a picture like this allows us to feel something a little bit different, that we can relate to, and put ourselves in the position of the people who have been suffering there for so long.Los Angeles, USA, 13 JuneView image in fullscreenA man looks at missing signs for people arrested and deported by ICEEthan Noah RoyThere had been small protests against mass deportation throughout the year, but on 6 June, big protests erupted after several immigration raids and the arrest and detainment of a trade union leader. People gathered at the Metropolitan Detention Centre, and it turned into a clash between protesters and police.For the next few days, there was more violence. People sprayed anti-ICE slogans on Waymo self-driving taxis and set them on fire (one reason they’ve become a target is because, equipped with cameras, protesters believe the cars are part of the surveillance state). People would gather outside the detention centre, where ICE agents would go in and out, and once clashes began to escalate, the mayor of Los Angeles put a 6pm curfew in place.People had put “missing” posters, of people detained by ICE, up on the OOMO Cube, a public art installation by Nicole Maloney, outside the Japanese American National Museum, around a block away from the detention centre. It was about 5.50pm and I was heading to my car, and I saw students running, trying to get to the metro line.This one kid was riding his skateboard, trying to get home as fast as possible, but when he saw the missing signs, he stopped in his tracks, got off his skateboard, and just looked. He told me that it had really hit home, and that he knew people this was affecting. He was a young Latino man.I grew up in LA and I know a lot of people who haven’t left their homes in months for fear of being detained. LA has a huge Hispanic community, it’s a part of the culture here. It felt like that very culture was under attack. Most people I’ve seen who were stopped were Latino, Black and Asian people. This was around the time the national guard were deployed, so it was this feeling of authoritarianism right on our doorstep.New York City, USA, 11 FebruaryView image in fullscreenBedlington terrierscompete in theWestminster Kennel Club Dog ShowAndres Kudacki/Getty ImagesI really like this breed, bedlington terriers. They look a bit surreal, like a cartoon character, especially when they are groomed like that. This was just after judging in their category at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, the biggest of its kind in the United States. The show is quite chaotic, with different categories such as agility and breed competitions running straight after each other and big crowds watching. People are preparing the dogs, sharing the space, going into the competition area, so there is a lot of action.I think this photo shows a different moment of calm after the competition. I spent a little bit of extra time in the judging arena, while the handlers were chatting with their dogs, and getting ready to leave. I don’t know if any of these dogs had won their class, and would go on to the finals at Madison Square Garden, but they were all well behaved – they’re highly trained.I’ve been covering a lot of hardcore news this year, but this picture is a little more joyful.Explore more on these topicsPictures of the yearnewsShareReuse this content"

Whether it’s a quick sandwich filling in times of chaos or an effortless party dip, I am addicted. My favourite way to serve it, though, is as part of a loaded crisp platter. Use salted or pickle crisps, and load them up with spoonfuls of pimento cheese, sliced pickles, herbs and heat. Move over nachos, there’s a new crisp platter in town.Pimento cheese and pickle loaded crispsIf you can get proper jarred pimentos, then by all means use them, but I find those cheese-stuffed bell peppers from the deli counter easier to find (and they work brilliantly).Prep25 minServes8-10125g mature cheddar, grated250g cream cheese100g mayonnaise120g cheese-stuffed bell peppers, drained and finely chopped¼ tsp garlic powder¼ tsp sweet smoked paprika, plus extra to serveSea salt andblack pepper½ bunchspring onions, trimmed and finely sliced250g ready salted crisps5 cornichons, finely sliced1 fresh green chilli, halved lengthways and finely sliced2 pickled green chillies(optional)2sprigsflat-leaf parsley, choppedIn a large bowl, mix the grated cheddar, cream cheese, mayonnaise, chopped bell peppers, garlic powder and paprika. Season well, add most of the spring onions and beat well to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning. (You can make the dip well in advance and store it in a covered container in the fridge until you’re ready to serve.)Spread out the crisps on a platter and spoon the pimento dip over the top. Sprinkle over the remaining sliced spring onions, all the sliced cornichons, the sliced green chilli, the whole pickled chillies, if using, and the chopped parsley. Sprinkle with a few pinches of paprika and serve.Explore more on these topicsFoodSnacksNew yearCheeseVegetablesAmerican food and drinkHerbs and spicesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Merriam-Webster dictionary editors chose “slop” as 2025’s word of the year. New York Magazine recentlydroppedits “Stupid Issue”, with a cover story exploring America’s collective “cognitive decline”. There are big problems in the humanities: reading test scores aredownfor students nationwide, and undergraduatescannotread full books any more.‘It’s so boring’: gen Z parents don’t like reading to their kids – and educators are worriedRead moreEven storytime – a comfy couch, a cardboard book, a kid’s rapt attention as their parent reads them a story – is an endangered activity. According to an Aprilreportfrom HarperCollins UK, parents have lost the love of reading to their children, with fewer than half of gen Z parents calling the activity “fun for me”. According to the survey of 1,596 parents of children aged zero to 13, almost one in three found reading “more a subject to learn” than an experience to enjoy. Only a third of kids aged five to 10 frequently read for fun, compared with over half in 2012.“It is boring,” one Reddit userwroteon r/books. “The books that my kid likes suck. But, like, that’s your job as a parent.”Educators, parents and those whocherish getting lost in a good bookare, understandably, worried. And while it is hard to compete withMs Rachelor Bluey, there are ways to liven up old fashioned storytime. Ahead, parents share the unorthodoxtactics they say get their young kids interested in reading.Enlist ChatGPTWhen Bri Ramos went to parent night at her kids’ elementary school in Oklahoma City, a first-grade teacher said something that stuck with her: “I can tell if you read to your child every night, or if you do not,” the teacher told her. “There is such a drastic difference in a developing child’s brain, and it’s just based on that 10 to 20 minutes of reading every night.”[Dramatic reading] has a greater impact on their life and how they connect to stories ... It’s words on a page that were brought to lifeArjay SmithAfter using ChatGPT to help find recipes to tempt her picky eaters, Ramos, who is 37 and works in marketing, turned her sights on its “talk” feature to help her read to them. Some nights before bed, instead of opening a copy of Mother Goose, Ramos asks ChatGPT to tell a bedtime story about a little girl who is a princess – or maybe a dragon fighter – on an adventure. Ramos named the character Camilla, after her six-year-old daughter, and told the chatbot to speak in a British accent, because that’s just fun. “It’s usually two to three minutes, and then we have it ask reading comprehension questions about the story afterwards,” Ramos said.Since the stories are about Camilla, she tends to get “giggly and excited, and really listens”, as opposed to when she’s learning to reading during storytime and is so focused on getting the words right that she doesn’t fully grasp the larger plot. “When we’re reading from a book, it’s more technical,” Ramos said. “When we’re reading from AI, it’s more fun and engaging.”The family uses ChatGPT for storytime sparingly. “It’s very effective when [the kids are] burnt out or frustrated, or when we’ve read Sam-I-am 152 times and just cannot do it again,” Ramos said. “It just adds a nice little change into the routine.”‘My son genuinely believed it was real’: Parents are letting little kids play with AI. Are they wrong?Read moreOutsourcing the demands of parenthoodto large language models is understandably controversial; generative AI programs such as ChatGPT are not built for children. A recentstudyfound that when adults used generative AI to come up with prompts for a short story, it increased their creativity but decreased the diversity in their collective writing output. In other words, material created by ChatGPT is narrow in its scope, while people read books, in part, to learn about and empathize with people or places that differ from them.“It’s totally understandable that parents would use AI to create stories that involve their kids,” said Alexandria Abenshon, director of children’s programs and services at the New York Public Library. “I think it gives us a good jumping-off point to think about authorship, how we [as adults] can write stories that might involve our own kids. It’s a fine line, but I think it’s ultimately up to each parent to navigate that in a way that feels safe for them.”For her part, Ramos always supervises her kids’ interactions with ChatGPT, ensuring they are “age-appropriate”. “I think it’s really important for parents to not feel guilty. Using technology as an asset and having your child read is better than not reading it all,” she said.So far, she has yet to adapt a ChatGPT-style British accent for when she reads aloud to Camilla herself. “Maybe after a few glasses of wine.”Grab a cookbookAlliah L Agostini, a children’s and cookbook author from Montclair, New Jersey, has a 10-year-old daughter who is an “enthusiastic reader” and an eight-year-old son who is “a bit less so”. While working on her latest cookbook, Agostini noticed that her kids were always around to taste-test recipes, indicating they were just as interested in the process of cooking as she was. She decided to read a cookbook with them.“I was like, ‘Wait a minute, this is just as much reading as anything else,’” said Agostini, 43. “I think a lot of people downplay reading cookbooks because there’s no story, but it’s fun for them to look at the steps, follow instructions and create something with a fulfilling end result.”How to buy a book for a child who is a non-reader? The trick is to meet them where they are | Allison TaitRead moreNow the family chooses interesting cookbooks to read while they work together in the kitchen. It is, as Agostini says, “sneaking in some reading” – but why judge something that works for a kid who is not naturally drawn to the library?“Kids consume media a little bit differently than we did,” Agostini said. “Be patient with them. It’s not the smoothest ride to create a recipe, and it will probably take you twice as long as reading a book, but it’s fun and creates great memories.”Pretend you’re Christopher WalkenArjay Smith has been an actor for 32 years, and lives in Los Angeles where he is working on the procedural police drama The Rookie. You can also catch him playing the role of “dad who does dramatic readings for his kids” almost every night, using impressions of Christopher Walken, Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau, James Brown and Morgan Freeman, plus a “generic deep monster voice”, to narrate the books.Making sure that we have a time and a space to read are critical ingredients to building a relationship with readingAlexandria AbenshonSmith enlists co-stars, too; his wife will read aloud while he acts out the plot, or one of his good friends, another actor, and will help him turn children’s books into two-person plays to perform for their kids when they vacation together.“It keeps the energy high, but it also sticks with the children that much longer,” Smith, 42, said of the theatrics. “It has a greater impact on their life and how they connect to stories: now it’s not just words on a page, it’s words on a page that were brought to life, and each character has their own individual identity via your voice and vibration.”Learn from a professionalAbenshon, from the New York Public Library, is not a parent herself, but she has spent countless hours reading to kids during her days as a children’s librarian. She encourages parents to “embrace all types of reading” – even if that means picking up awordless picture bookand working with a child to narrate it.Clap and count, chop it up: how to boost your child’s literacy in playful ways | Sarah AyoubRead more“It’s really about letting kids make the stories that are meaningful for them at that moment,” Abenshon said. Then, when the kids get older, let them chose what they read as they will naturally gravitate to what interests them.Abenshon says she also makes a point of reading for her own pleasure in front of kids at the library. “It’s really just as simple as modeling,” she said.Cultivating an appreciation for reading doesn’t happen overnight. “Build the habit,” Abenshon said. “Making sure that we have a time and a space to read are critical ingredients to building a relationship with reading. With kids, it’s so important to have a dedicated time that signals that reading is something worth doing.”Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingLiteracyChildrenArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

You can do this using baking soda (also known as bicarbonate of soda), lemon juice or a white vinegar solution. Morphy Richards has aguide on how to tackle this jobon its website. Alternatively, you can use a product such as Waitrose’s Essential Liquid Appliance Descaler, which costs£2.50. This is also useful for cleaning shower heads with certain finishes such as nickel, gold or brass.You can buy a limescale catcher that can be used to prevent buildup in water tanks and electrical water boilers for about £10. For kettles,Dunelm has a limescale collector for £1.50.You can extend the life of your tumble dryer by removing lint from the filters after every use – pull out bits by hand or give it a wipe with a cloth.Hotpointrecommends giving the filter and its housing a deep clean every few months. You can do this by unplugging your unit and vacuuming the filter. If you don’t have a thin enough nozzle for your vacuum cleaner, you can buy a lint cleaning extension kit for£7.99on Amazon.View image in fullscreenKeep on top of the limescale buildup in your kettle.Photograph: Steve Gorton/Getty Images/Dorling Kindersley RFRegularly top up salt and rinse aid in the dishwasher. This optimises the conditions for your dishes to be cleaned and looks after the machine. Tesco sells a 3kg bag of dishwasher salt for£3.75, and a bottle of rinse and shine aid for£4.Most newer freezers are “frost-free” and do not require defrosting. If yours is not, it is recommended that you defrost it once a year. Otherwise ice can build up on the walls, forcing the appliance to work harder.According to the retailerAO, the best way to do this is to unplug and empty your freezer, then lay towels down to catch any ice and water, placing bowls of hot water inside to help the ice melt faster. Then give the inside a wipe using washing-up liquid or white vinegar to help keep it smelling clean.MaintaindrainsThe plumbing company BlockBusters recommends you pour a kettle of boiling water down your kitchen and bathroom drains every week. This can cut through any grease and oil that is stuck.If your drain is particularly clogged, you can buy a specialist cleaner. A one-litre bottle of Mr Muscle Sink & Drain Unblocker Gel costs£6.20from Waitrose.Drain blockers are designed for catching debris such as food scraps, hair and soap scum before they enter the plumbingInvesting in small items, such as drain strainers and coil drain cleaners, can help you avoid blockages, says Teresa Paul, the director of sustainability category development at the DIY chain Wickes.Sink and bath strainers are designed for catching debris such as food scraps, hair and soap scum before they can enter the plumbing. Wickes sell them for£1.80, or you can pick one up fromB&Q for £1.55.Wickes also sells a 1.8-metre coil drain cleaner for£9, which can access and clear clogs further down the drain. Alternatively, Screwfix sells a 7.6-metre flexible rod for£16.99.To get rid of smells, mix two tablespoons of baking soda into one cup of white vinegar and pour it down your drain straight away.Inspect your roof andgutters“You don’t need scaffolding to spot trouble,” says Higgins, who recommends using binoculars to inspect your roof. Look out for cracked tiles, moss growth, sagging sections and stone debris falling into the gutters.Replacing a few tiles or repairing flashing costs significantly less than a full reroofing, so it is best to stay on top of any work. “A relatively inexpensive roof repair can prevent far more costly internal water damage,” Higgins says.Checking the loft every few months, especially after heavy rain, helps you spot signs of leaks or poor airflow before they become big issues.View image in fullscreenIt’s worth repairing any damaged tiles on your roof.Photograph: Matt West/Rex/ShutterstockBlocked gutters cause rainwater to spill down external walls, leading to damp, mould and even structural issues. “Cleaning them twice a year can save money in the long term,” Higgins says. Gutter brushes are an easy-to-install, low-maintenance fix that act as a buffer to keep gutters clear while letting water flow. Wickes sells a four-metre roll for£24each, while Screwfix sells a three-pack of four-metre rolls for£79.99.If you are going to hire someone to do some cleaning or maintenance work on your gutters, Higgins recommends you do your research. “Tradespeople are often unregulated, so use neighbourhood WhatsApp and Facebook groups to find someone trustworthy,” she says.Some insurance companies won’t accept gutter damage claims if they were found to be dirty and malfunctioning, according to Nathan Blackler, a home insurance expert from the comparison website GoCompare. “All home maintenance tasks are the responsibility of the homeowner and should be done, and most home insurance plans state this as a clause,” he says.Check your boilerKeeping your boiler regularly serviced – ideally once a year – should extend its life and prevent the need for emergency callouts. “A boiler breakdown in winter is both a financial and a practical nightmare,” Higgins says.According to the consumer group Which?, a standard boiler service costs between £70 and £110. In comparison, a new boiler costs anywhere between £1,200 and £2,000, according toCheckatrade. This is the cost of the boiler alone, and the cost on installation could be at least the same again.Test smoke and COalarmsYou should test your smoke and carbon monoxide alarms every month, says Fire England. Aside from the risk of injury and expensive damage, insurance companies will not cover fire-related damage otherwise.“If your fire alarm is broken, hasn’t had the necessary maintenance, or there are faulty wires that haven’t been replaced, your accident could be excluded from your fire insurance policy, but this depends on your individual insurer,” says Matthew Harwood, a home insurance expert from the comparison website Confused.com. “Many home insurance policies require proof of regular alarm maintenance to validate claims related to fire, theft or damage. Failure to provide this proof could result in a denied claim, leaving the homeowner financially vulnerable.”View image in fullscreenYou should test your smoke alarm every month.Photograph: PATest your device by pressing the button until the alarm sounds. If there is no sound, you need to replace the battery. If an alarm has a constant beeping, it is a sign to change the battery immediately.Keep a ‘just in case’fund“Protect yourself against the cost of unexpected repairs like broken fences or your heating packing up by putting money aside in a regular savings account each month,” saysSue Hayward, a consumer commentator. “This way, you’ll build a small slush fund, and earn some interest, to help cushion the cost and save your bank balance from taking a battering or tipping you into the red.”It is recommended that homeowners budget for about 1-2% of their property’s total value each year for maintenance costs, according toCheckatrade. As of September 2025, the average house price in the UK is£271,531– so if your property is worth that much, you should think about keeping aside at least £2,715 annually. However, keep in mind that older properties often require more maintenance, and therefore more money – the community marketplace platform Airtaskerrecommendssaving 3-4% of your property’s worth if it is more than 20 years old.All details and prices correct at time of going to pressExplore more on these topicsHome improvementsMoney hacksSaving moneyConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You can feel stressed watching a horror movie, or you can experience long-term stress, like going through a divorce.”Short-term stress can temporarily affect your immune system. “The number of immune cells in the blood changes,” says Davis. “But it returns to normal within about an hour, so it’s unlikely to have any major impact.”Long-term stress is a different story. When your body perceives a threat, the adrenal glands release hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol. They prepare the body for a “fight or flight” response – increasing your blood pressure and heart rate, but also suppressing the immune system.Adding cortisol to immune cells makes them much less effective at destroying diseased cells“We can see this even at the molecular level,” says Davis, the author ofSelf Defence: A Myth-Busting Guide to Immune Health. “If we take immune cells and expose them to diseased cells, like cancer, the immune cells will usually destroy them. But if we add cortisol, they become much less effective.” If this exposure to stress hormones lasts for weeks or months, our immune system will be diminished.Practices such as mindfulness, tai chi and other stress-reduction strategies have been shown to lower cortisol levels, which should benefit immunity. However, proving this is difficult, says Davis. You can’t ethically expose large numbers of people to an illness to test their immune response, and measuring “immune health” in a real-world setting is complicated. “It’s also hard because you can’t avoid stress,” he adds. “Every change in our life will have some stress associated with it, and a lot of changes are positive.”That said, if you’re worried about long-term stress, Davis recommends reaching out to your GP.Explore more on these topicsHealthIs it true that …Health & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As I’m wearing a quarter-zip jumper and sipping on an iced matcha, you’d be forgiven for thinking it’s my last day of term before the school holidays. The giveaway is it’s a Saturday in London’s Soho, and I’m surrounded by 20 or so young men between the ages of 13 and 21 who are all here forLondon’s first ever “quarter-zip meetup”.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Organised, rather bizarrely, by sibling rappers OKay the Duo, the meetup is the latest manifestation of a growing tongue-in-cheek trend for quarter-zips and matcha that has taken over TikTok globally. Previous meetups have taken place inHoustonandRotterdam.The trend started when Jason Gyamfi, a computer science graduate, posted a video on TikTok of him and his friend Richard Minor showing off their quarter-zips. In his video, Gyamfi, the self-proclaimed“founder of the quarter-zip movement”, says: “We don’t do Nike Tech. We don’t do coffee. It’s straight quarter-zips and matchas around here.”It’s a lot easier to communicate with people when they don’t stereotype you based on what you’re wearingThe video has more than 30m views and spawned a “movement” that sees young, predominantly black men swapping the popular Nike Tech fleece – a snug tracksuit with a chevron across the body and the iconic swoosh on the chest – for a quarter-zip of any colour and from any brand, though a navy cable knit from Ralph Lauren won’t hurt.The subtext is that quarter-zips, often associated with white, middle-class finance bros – or Rishi Sunak – signify professionalism, while Nike Techs, often associated with black, working-class men living in cities, represent criminality. To wear a quarter-zip,these videos say, is to complete your transformation from a “hoodlum” into something more respectable.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Ola, Xaymaca and Dima at the meetup in London.Photograph: Karen Stanley/The GuardianAt the London meetup, Seph and his friend David emphasise the connotations of a Nike Tech fleece versus a quarter-zip. To Seph, these fleeces are associated with “gangs and essentially black people, if I’m being honest with you”. To David, quarter-zips and matcha “represent maturity”. Wearing a quarter-zip and sipping matcha seems to be tied to a desire to defy racial stereotypes and grow into men accepted by the dominant culture.Many of the young people at the meetup, hyper-aware of how they may be perceived, feel the same way. “I used to wear Nike Techs every day,” says 16-year-old Ola Adams. “I actually still have some in my wardrobe.” His friends jeer upon hearing this. He continues: “But after today it’s making me reconsider my life decisions. It’s a lot easier to communicate with people when they don’t stereotype you based on what you’re wearing.”View image in fullscreenQuarter-zips ‘represent maturity’, according to David, left, with his friend Seph at the London meetup.Photograph: Karen Stanley/The GuardianIt’s the latest iteration of a trend that’s been growing steadily over the last few years: the casualisation of office wear, accelerated by the pandemic. According to Prof Andrew Groves, director of theWestminster Menswear Archive, the pullover, originally a part of gym and ski wear in the 1930s, has “become the default business-casual layer because it reads smart without being formal. It works across work and leisure, which has always been the point.”According to John Lewis, searches formen’s quarter-zipsare up 425% this year, but it’s a trend that spans womenswear too. The opening look at Matthieu Blazy’s first Métiers d’Art collection at Chanelincluded a beige quarter-zipper.The quarter-zip I’m wearing today is by Ralph Lauren. It’s not my first, which was a warm, grey one from Arket, which I bought for my first job in 2023 as a way of showing I was mature without trying too hard – the sartorial equivalent of a digestive biscuit. Described by GQ as “a joyless jumper for the joyless grind”, the quarter-zip attracted few comments at work as it represented belonging. But outside the workplace it won me compliments when I wore it with a white T and jeans, particularly from women I dated.This is part of the appeal for some of the teenage boys I speak to at the meetup, who see the movement as an extension of theperformative male phenomenon. This involves young men knowingly adopting interests typically associated with femininity – such as drinking matcha,listening to Clairoand wearing tote bags – in the hope of attracting progressive women. They proudly tell me about their love of feminism, literature and feminist literature, couched in ironytypical of a chronically online generation.The same garment can read as professional, ironic, aspirational or threatening, depending on the wearer and the settingThe trend offers an aspirational version of masculinity that blends the softness of the performative male with the power of a finance bro. It’s also an appealing image in the face ofheteropessimism– characterised by a sense of embarrassment, particularly among straight women, regarding heterosexual relationships – andhigh unemployment among graduates. Maybe by wearing a quarter-zip, you can manifest the life you really want to lead instead of succumbing to the doom and gloom surrounding you.For Andrew Amoako – a wealth management associate and content creator responsible for theMaking It Out TikTok series, which pokes fun at corporate culture while showing people from underprivileged backgrounds the benefits of the corporate world – the quarter zip trend is also about social mobility.View image in fullscreenRishi Sunak in a quarter-zip in 2024.Photograph: Ian Forsyth/AFP/Getty Images“When you stop wearing Tech fleeces and you start wearing quarter-zips, it means you’ve probably got a better job,” he says. But he’s quick to point out that he still wears tracksuits when meeting friends. “Some people in the [quarter-zip] movement are stigmatising the Tech fleece. I play on that satirical element, but I don’t think there’s anything wrong with wearing a tracksuit.”Still, the pitfalls promoted by such respectability politics remain. By focusing on the way people are dressed, it disregards the role race plays in the social hierarchy. Some African Americans adopted anIvy League style of dressto great effect during the civil rights movement to help them demand equality, but many of them were ultimately persecuted because of the colour of their skin.Liza Betts, senior lecturer and researcher at the University of the Arts London, argues: “Very often it doesn’t matter about the clothing changes that are made, as value and legitimisation have been attached (or not) to the bodies themselves before the language of dress is invoked.” Take, for example, the fact that some working-class British people sported the high-fashion heritage brand Burberry’s nova check in the noughties to show their aspiration, but were stillpejoratively labelled “chavs”. As Groves points out of the quarter-zip: “The same garment can read as professional, ironic, aspirational or threatening, depending on the wearer and the setting.”Of course, the quarter-zip and matcha trend is supposed to be lighthearted, a bit of fun that may encourage some people to dress differently. But it’s important to challenge some of the stereotypes attached to particular items of clothing in the first place. A quarter-zip will be more appropriate in some situations, while a Nike Tech fleece will be more comfortable in others.It doesn’t need to be either or.Explore more on these topicsFashionMen's fashionMen's topsMen's sportswearfeaturesShareReuse this content"

An automatic blind, which I can operate without getting out of bed, rises to reveal an ocean view: the dramatic storm-surging North Sea with great black-backed gulls circling nearby and a distant ship on the horizon. A watery gold sunrise lights the clouds and turbulent grey water.I’m the first person to sleep in the new Kraken lodge at Still Southwold, a former farm in Easton Bavents on the Suffolk coast. It’s a stylish wooden cabin, one of a scattering of holiday lets in an area prone to aggressive coastal erosion. The owner, Anne Jones, describes the challenges of living on a coast that is rapidly receding in the face of climate-exacerbated storms: the waves have eroded more than 40 hectares (100 acres), and the family business “is no longer a viable farm”. Instead, it is home to low-carbon cottages and cabins, “designed to be movable when the land they stand on is lost to the sea”. The latest projects include a sea-view sauna and a ‘dune hut’ on the beach for reflexology treatments “with the sea and waves as the backdrop”.Southwold area mapBy train, bus and on foot, I’m here for the beaches, marshes, heathland and villages. Arriving at sunset, Still Southwold feels wild and remote, with lapwings flapping through the twilight like huge bats, butSouthwold pieris just an easy 10-minute walk away. Heading to the bus stop next morning, I notice plumes of spray behind the beach huts. Waves are crashing over the concrete promenade near the pier. There’s a contrast between the brightly painted row of huts, with their candy stripes and stained-glass dolphins, and the heaving, uncontainable ocean behind them. It’s a worrying sign, as the path I’ve chosen today is only walkable at low tide. Erosion means the official coast path between Lowestoft and Southwold has been mostly rerouted inland and the soft cliff edges are perilous.View image in fullscreenKraken cabin at Still Southwold.Photograph: Big Fish Photography/Still SouthwoldA 20-minute bus ride from the end of Pier Avenue brings me to Kessingland, a village just south of Lowestoft. Heading for the coast, with supplies fromBushells Bakery, I soon reach Rider Haggard Lane. The author of King Solomon’s Mines, H Rider Haggard,spent several summers in a holiday home on the cliffs in Kessingland, where he was visited by his friend Rudyard Kipling. Haggard planted marram grass to stop the sea encroaching and, climbing down steps on to the beach, I find there’s still a wide marram-grass-covered band of shingle. The sandy cliffs include layers of clay and fossil traces of steppe mammoths, hippos and sabre-toothed cats.Benacre Broad is unexpectedly lovely. Woods and marshes surround a beautiful fragile lake, decked with salt-bleached tree trunks like a natural sculpture gardenAt the far end of the beach, near flood management works, a Natural England sign warns that the beach-walking route from here to Southwold is impassable near Easton Bavents. The owners of Still Southwold give visitors a code for a gate between their clifftop farm and Covehithe Beach. I press on, looking warily at the mess of washed-up kelp and driftwood that winter waves have hurled on to the land.A hardy hiker is heading the other way in shorts, with a battered rucksack. He’s one of only three people I meet all day, and I check the state of the beach ahead. Is it safe? Is it walkable? “There’s a storm surge,” says the hiker. “The tide’s been much higher than expected. The wind’s from the north and the North Sea’s wider at the top than the bottom – it’s like someone blowing on a teacup.” The image stays with me all day, intensified by the milky-brown colour of the water, as the giant-tea-cooling waves roll into the sandy shore.View image in fullscreenBenacre broad.Photograph: Matthew Murphy/AlamyBenacre Broad is unexpectedly lovely. A loop of woods and marshes surrounds a beautiful and fragile lake, cut off from the sea by a shifting bank of sand and shingle, decked with salt-bleached roots and tree trunks like a natural sculpture garden. The coast here has retreated more than 500 metres in the last couple of centuries, and salt water now often breaches the bird-rich lake. I eat my sandwich in the sheltered bird hide, listening for resident warblers in the reeds, but hear only the roar of the sea.The atmospheric ruins of a huge medieval church stand on the cliffs above Benacre.St Andrew’s, Covehitheis now just the tall 14th-century tower and a smaller thatched building, under decaying arches, with the old octagonal carved font inside. At the end of the lane from church to coast, a red warning sign says “Footpath Closed” where the old coastal path ends abruptly on the collapsed cliff edge.We head back along boardwalks by the Dunwich River, remembering the drowned town of Dunwich not far away under the waves, a kind of Suffolk AtlantisLater, the warm bar of theSwan in Southwoldis extra welcome after a chilly day on windswept beaches. There’s port-laced mulled wine on offer, as well as creamy Baron Bigod brie from the Fen Farm Dairy or slow-cookedBlythburgh porkwith apple.Next day, I meet friends in the scone-scentedBloomcafe on Southwold High Street and we stroll across Southwold Common to Walberswick. We’re following a section of the nightjar waymarks of theSandlings Walk, a long-distance hike through surviving fragments of heathland between Southwold and Ipswich. Since medieval times, 90% of what was once a continuous stretch of Suffolk heath has been lost.View image in fullscreenThe ferry across the Blyth.Photograph: AlamyThe last autumn colours are glowing across Walberswick Common, with its bracken and birch trees. We head back along boardwalks by the Dunwich River, remembering thedrowned town of Dunwichnot far away under the waves, a kind of Suffolk Atlantis. The wind has dropped today and the marsh is full of noises: the sudden trilling of a Cetti’s warbler and the rare song of a bearded tit from the miles of whispering reedbeds.

I felt everything’: readers tell us how they would use their last chance to send a letterWith the Danish postal service ending its letter deliveries, we asked what you would put in your final envelopeJane ClintonMon 29 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 11.38 ESTShareAt the end of December, the Danish postal service willdeliver its last letter, focusing on packages, citing the “increasing digitalisation” of society.While the public will still be able to send letters through the distributor DAO, it made us think about how we would use that last chance to send a letter.Many people responded to our callout asking what they would write in their last letter and why. Here is a selection.‘I would write to my grandson to tell him how much he is loved’View image in fullscreenPhilip and with his grandson, Remy, in a photo taken by granny Penny.Photograph: Penny/ Guardian CommunityMy wife, Penny, and I moved to Reigate, Surrey, nearly two years ago to be nearer our grandson, Remy, now aged two-and-a-half, after living in Bristol for about 45 years. We look after him one day a week at his home in south-east London.I would send my last postal letter to him and include a poem that I’ve already written for him, to try to express how much he means to me and to remind him, should he ever need reminding, that he is loved. It’s a cliche to say that children are the hope for the future, but the world seems a very dark place just now, and I realise it’s difficult to put into words what love means.I’m a poet who’s written a number of more lighthearted poems about my grandson/for my grandson as he has learned first to walk and now talk, giving us so much joy in the process, but the one I would send in the letter is an attempt to pass on what small amount of wisdom I have managed to acquire in a lifetime of struggle and doubt.I wanted it to be a message to him if I wasn’t around any more. In essence, it boils down to the need for kindness and a faith that gentleness is a form of strength. The poem harks back to a time before he had words, and includes the lines:And if you miss me when I’m gone/Imagine I’m a robin in a tree,/Just like the one you pointed at todayNow he’s got lots of words and is a real chatterbox.Philip, 66, retired, Reigate‘My last letter would close the loop of our archive of letters to each other’View image in fullscreenChris and Tryn on their wedding day.Photograph: Chris/Guardian CommunityI would address my last postal letter to my wife, Tryn. Tryn passed away on 1 May 2022, four months after our 55th wedding anniversary. Our four-year courtship during the 1960s took place primarily through hundreds of postal letters while I was at sea in the US Navy. My final postal letter will attempt to close the loop of our archive of handwritten love and gratitude.View image in fullscreenSome of the letters exchanged between Chris and Tryn.Photograph: Chris/Guardian CommunityIt would begin by quoting our declarations of mutual love extracted from our saved archive of courting letters, reminding us what young love looked like, written on flimsy blue airmail stationery. We met at Villanova University, Pennsylvania, at a lunch place on campus. Tryn was studying nursing and I was a social studies student. She was very outgoing and smart, smarter than anybody in the room. We struck up a conversation and that was the start of a lovely relationship.My final letter would remind us of our travels together, the births, trials and adventures of our five children, mature love, and our graduation to blessed grandparenthood. My letter would close with a selection from the last words of our earliest love letters, closing the circle of our life on earth together, thanking Tryn profusely, and quoting my song, Till We Meet Again, which I wrote after her passing.Chris Clark, 83, retired professor, Arizona, USA‘I would thank mum for her letters, which filled me with happiness and love’View image in fullscreenAnnie and her mother.Photograph: Anne/Guardian CommunityI moved to London in 1975 from rural Ireland when the only mode of communication was via letter, and it was all we could afford at the time.I would send my last postal letter to my mother, Mary, who lives in Ireland. Born in 1933 and married at 17 to a farm labourer. They had eight children. My father left for London to earn money for the family. On Saturdays, the postman would deliver a letter to Mam with £5 a week to feed their growing family. We all waited eagerly for this letter. My mother wrote weekly letters to her sisters, her husband and all her children when we left home. It was a lifeline for us all. Then one day, the letters from my father stopped, and so did the money. She coped, but I don’t know how she did it.Times changed, and people stopped writing letters, and I noticed how my mother would still walk to the front door on her Zimmer frame only to find a clutch of junk mail and bills. I would hear her let out a long sigh before she said “tsk tsk” in disappointment as she flicked through the rubbish. She is now in a care home and I write to her regularly. She doesn’t know who is writing to her most of the time, but she gets a buzz from receiving letters and cards.Annie, 68, retired, LondonDearest Mum,This will be the last letter I can write as the Post Office will not be delivering any letters any more. As I wrote these words, I became overwhelmed with sadness, as I know how much you like to receive a letter or a card. In any case, I want you to know that all the letters and cards and money you posted to me over the years were well received. It was such a joy to see your little blue envelope arrive each week full of news from home, your beautiful small writing, and the birthday letter, always with cash.When I left home at 18, your weekly letters helped me to get to know the sweet, loving side of your nature, which you could not express face-to-face. You hated being hugged, you could never write “love” or finish a letter with kisses, as your upbringing made it seem wrong. I remember once kissing you awkwardly on the top of your head – you recoiled like you had been stung by a bee.We laughed about it, and I stopped hugging and kissing as you hated it. But your letters filled me with happiness and love as you found the time and the money to pay for postage to show how much you loved me by sharing your life week by week. So, goodbye for now, but know this – I feel that I am the luckiest person in the world to have a mother like you, who sacrificed everything so that we would all thrive.Mother, you gave me life and kept me safe – I owe you a debt of gratitude and give thanks every single day for your unforgettable kindness.Your loving daughter, Annie‘Letter writing is so underrated’Dipak loves writing and receiving letters.Photograph: Dipak/Guardian CommunityI’m 66, so I am in the last quarter of my life. I have never had health issues and just recently have been in the hospital and began thinking about my life. It was helpful to write it all down in a letter.I then wondered who I should send it to, and thought, well, it doesn’t need to be to anyone. I grew up writing letters, but it is so expensive to send them now, and people tend to respond by text, WhatsApp or a phone call. I say to them: ‘I don’t want to chat, can’t you write me a letter?’ Letter writing is so underrated.Dipak, 66, civil servant, LondonA Letter tonoone inparticularI fell in love more times than I can count – with people, with places, with moments that didn’t make sense until they were gone. I got things wrong. I took things too seriously, then not seriously enough. I laughed far too loudly in quiet rooms, and cried on the tube. I lived. Which is harder than it sounds. And now, in the spirit ofRabindranath Tagore, who once wrote to the people of the future while shackled by empire: I write not from oppression, but from observation.From the quiet knowing that life is briefand beautifully absurd. If this somehow finds you long after I’m gone, I hope your world is softer. And I hope you, too, are choosing your life over the one prescribed to you. So here it is: I was here. I tried. I felt everything. And I left behind a whisper, just in case someone was listening. Thank God I read Trump’s obituary before I perished.P.S. If you’re reading this in 2125, I am certain the District Line still has signal failures, and leaves on the track damage steel wheels…‘I’d write to my teacher to thank him’I would send my last letter to the teacher who gave me, when I was 18, the joys of intellectual inquiry, the one who showed me how to read deeply – not just to glean the surface meaning or intent. Dan O’Connell taught literature at Hobart College in New York state. When he spoke, an electric current ran through him; he was so charged with passion for ideas. That enthusiasm came across to me.We kept in touch over the years and I saw him months before he died in 2023. He is always with me when I read great literature.Peter Pullman, 71, author, Pennsylvania, USADear Dan: When I read, at some moment I put my finger in the book, turn around, and see you behind – encouraging me to go deeper. Thanks for staying over my shoulder.‘I would reflect on all the letters we’ve shared and how much they meant to me’View image in fullscreenFrancis and Lucy at the Doctor Who Experience when they were about 17.Photograph: Francis/Guardian CommunityI would write to my pen pal, Lucy, who lives in the States. We started writing to each other after meeting as kids in Southampton. I was about 12 and Lucy was probably 11, and we have kept in touch ever since. We met up a few times over the years when we were both living in the UK. Then Lucy moved to the US and I moved to Canada.View image in fullscreenFrancis during a visit to Lucy in Portland in 2023.Photograph: Francis/Guardian CommunityI recently moved back to the UK and I’d want my last letter to be to Lucy as a way to say goodbye to that way of communicating with them.I would reflect on all the letters and postcards we’ve shared over the years and how much they meant to me. I would tell them how much I’ll miss reading their words in their own handwriting. I’d also include all the usual stuff – what I’d been up to, books I think they’d like, opinions on Doctor Who, maybe a few poems or drawings. I have a letter lying around that I wrote to them well over a decade ago and forgot to send, so I’d include that as well!Francis O’Sullivan, 30, musician, Bolton‘I’d write to my girlfriend to tell her how special she is’View image in fullscreenDania and Taylor pictured in Oaxaca, Mexico, during the Dia de los Muertos festival this year.Photograph: Taylor/Guardian CommunityDania, my girlfriend, lives in Mexico, and I’m in Texas. We met online, chatted for a year, met in person in July, and started dating in October. We visit each other once a month, and we’ve talked about writing letters to pass the time while apart and as a cute way to communicate “in vintage”. The postal system is a bit unreliable, but we are going to start writing letters after the holiday. They will be old-fashioned letters with vivid stories about how our lives are going, or even about a particular memory from a specific day.Taylor, 35, IT auditor, TexasDear Dania,As I’m writing this letter, I’d usually talk about how I’m recalling a day in the life together or reflecting on how amazing life is together in general. However, I’d like to take a moment to acknowledge and share with you how truly special you are. From the first moment we began talking, to our first day holding hands, countless late nights, endless weekend and holiday trips, and so much more; you’re absolutely special in every way. Of all the things we’ve shared and experienced together, it is the quality time that has become most valuable. As I write this letter, I’m reflecting on all the memories and the future too.Here’s to a special letter (for the most special person), ironically written via text, though written nevertheless. I sincerely hope the digital version of this letter reaches you with its everlasting warmth.

For locals, the flytipping, vermin, maggots and mess are taking a huge environmental and emotional tollJessica MurraySocial affairs correspondentMon 29 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 12.24 ESTShareIt’s an icy cold winter morning, and 80-year-old Mohammed Bashir is armed with a broom, tackling the large pile of rubbish that has accumulated outside his terraced house in Small Heath,Birmingham.This has become an almost daily activity for Bashir since the city’s bin strike started 50 weeks ago and, like many in the city, he is starting to lose patience.“Look at the condition we’re living in. I’ve lived here for 64 years, I came to this country at 16 – I’ve never seen it this bad. I’m sick,” he says. “I try my best. At the end of the day, I just want my area clean. That’s all I want.”Piles of bin bags, broken glass and furniture have been dumped on the street outside his home and the mosque next door. Across the road, scorched pavement shows where a pile of rubbish was recently set on fire.Bashir follows the council’s advice and tries to take much of his rubbish to the local tip, but residents have to book a slot online, and Bashir cannot read or write in English. “I want to do it but it’s hard for old people like myself. We need help. The city needs help. It’s gone on too long,” he says.The bin strike in Birmingham hit headlines in March when the councildeclared a major incident due to 17,000 tonnes of rubbishthat had built up on the streets and was attracting vermin.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve never seen it this bad. I’m sick’ … Mohammed Bashir.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianAlthough the city council had used agency workers to cover the striking bin staff, people on the picket line were staging “go slow” protests that were preventing bin lorries from leaving the depot, causing the buildup of waste.After the council secured a court injunction in May to stop this from happening, a degree of normality returned and national attention swiftly moved on – people outside the city thought the strike had long since finished.But the people of Birmingham, which is home to more than one million, are still waiting for their normal bin collections to resume. With the workforce still striking, the council is relying on a smaller agency workforce which means collections are sporadic in some areas and there have been no recycling bin collections anywhere in the city since early January.It’s a health and safety hazard, and there’s a very bad smell. We still pay our council tax yet we do our bins like thisA December strike by the agency bin workers threatens to make things worse. Meanwhile, people have started to cram all their rubbish, including cardboard boxes, cans and bottles, into one general waste bin and they’re often overflowing by the time bin collection day comes round.The effect has been felt most in the more deprived areas of the city where there is higher-density living such as houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) and large families squeezed into small homes – there are eight people, including Bashir’s children and grandchildren, living in his house. “How is one bin enough?” he says. “I can guarantee you that you can go into every house on this street and it is overcrowded with people. There are more than six people, seven people, eight people. One bin is not enough, is it?”The result has been an increase in dumped bin bags and fly-tipping as people desperately try to get rid of their waste. Noor Ahmed, 57, said the bus stop outside her home has become a magnet for dumped rubbish, which she is forced to tackle while caring for her husband, who has cancer. “It’s a health and safety hazard, and there’s a very bad smell. I’ve had rats in my garden, even in my kitchen,” she says. “We have to go to the tip, but sometimes there are big queues. We started to organise groups to help older people who can’t take their own rubbish, we take it for them. We still pay our council tax and yet we do our bins like this. It’s exhausting.”View image in fullscreen‘We’re committed to see it through to the end’: bin lorry driver and Unite convener, Matt Reid, outside Birmingham city council’s depot in Tyseley.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianRobert Charlton, who runs his own pest control business in Birmingham, says it had been his busiest year since he first started working in the industry 11 years ago, and he has been gearing up for a hectic Christmas period. “It’s starting to pick up again because rodents are looking for food and shelter, so I’m getting more phone calls,” he says. “I’ve hardly had any days off, to be honest. At the peak, I was working from 8am to 8pm every day.”He says most of his callouts were for mice and rats, as well as dead foxes who had been snooping around the piled-up bin bags, and he had to deal with some very distressed families. “Last month I was called to a house and we caught 23 rodents. It was crazy – the worst I have seen in my career,” he says. Have the rats actually been as big as cats, as has been much quoted in the press since the start of the strike? “I would say kittens, yeah, I do believe that,” he says.One of the biggest impacts of the bin strike is the environmental toll. With recycling collections across the city paused for almost a year, more and more rubbish is heading into general waste, much of which ends up in an incinerator in the east of the city. Birmingham’s recycling rate has plummeted to 14%, substantially below the council’s target of 35% and the 44% average for England – of 90,667 tonnes of rubbish collected between July and September in Birmingham, just 12,471 tonnes was recycled.View image in fullscreenWaste and uncollected rubbish in the Balsall Heath area of Birmingham.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian“It is the biggest local authority in the country in population terms, so anything that happens in Birmingham affects 1.2 million people. And there is still no recycling collection,” says John Newson, from Birmingham Friends of the Earth. “Many people outside Birmingham, and even people inside Birmingham, can’t really believe that’s true and somehow think it’s over. But it is true, and that is a lot of stuff.”He says there’s growing concern that people’s recycling habits could be permanently disrupted. “It’s not about blaming people – nobody in Birmingham asked for this to happen or has any real control over it,” says Newson. “There is a lot of confusion in people’s minds now, and the trust that was built up has gone – what do you want us to do with our rubbish, and what are you going to do with it? It has all gone backwards.”Shafaq Hussain, a community leader and youth worker in Small Heath, says it would be particularly hard to reintroduce recycling in his area, where issues have persisted for some time. “It took a long time for us to do a lot of educating in the community about recycling, about the distinction between the two bins – but it has been almost a year now without that. So the environmental impact is very messy,” he says.He has been leading community calls to end the strike, or to force central government to intervene and bring the striking workers and council back around the table, saying that the voice of residents had been lost over the course of the year. “People are just fed up – we’ve had maggots, we’ve had rats,” he says. “There are about 190 takeaways in a radius of about a half-mile here, which creates more bulk waste and we’re substantially overcrowded – there’s a lot of people in each household. We’re the ones left dealing with it but there’s no transparency – we have no idea what has gone on in those negotiations.”View image in fullscreenBasmin Khan … ‘I don’t think the council know how to control it any more.’Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianOn the picket line outside the bin lorry depot in Tyseley, the striking bin workers, have said they are more resolved than ever – having voted to continue their strike mandate to May 2026, when Labour will be vying to keep control of the council in local elections. They want to guarantee pay protection for the rest of the bin workers following the council’s decision to scrap the waste and recycling collection officer role.Scrapping the role would not only cut costs but the council also argues that the position is an equal-pay liability risk, with no equivalent paying role in the female-dominated workforce such as cleaning staff and school-meal supervisors. The council has lost millions of pounds in equal-pay claims in recent years – it is one of the main reasons it went“bankrupt”. However, the unions say they have consulted lawyers who say the role is not an equal-pay liability risk.“We’re committed to see it through to the end,” says Matthew Reid, a bin lorry driver andUniteconvener. “We can’t go through 11 months of what we’ve been through, and put the city through, to get no results at the end of it.” The striking workers are receiving £70 a day from the Unite strike fund, which is a significant pay cut, although Reid says this is what they would be paid under the council’s plan.“There’s a feeling here of determination, people are willing to take that hit because they can’t accept an £8,000 [annual pay] loss,” he says. “But it has been arollercoaster. We’ve never been on strike for this long before, and there’s financial strain – people not being able to afford mortgages and rent, family strain. We just have to stand with one other.”View image in fullscreenNoor Ahmed … ‘I’ve had rats in my garden, even in my kitchen.’Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianSome of Basmin Khan’s videos, showing the huge piles of rubbish dumped on her street in Small Heath, have gone viral on social media – a mound of mattresses, broken furniture, cardboard boxes and plastic bottles sits at the end of her road, right next to a school playground.The 47-year-old says the strike has “emboldened” fly-tippers, and vans have appeared in the middle of the night to drop off rubbish, with little consequence. Some of her neighbours say they have paid money to have their rubbish taken away, only to find it dumped on a street corner less than a mile away. “I don’t think the council know how to control it any more,” she says. “I can’t blame the council completely and I’m not going to, but we are stuck because we just want them to see what we’re experiencing and give us something to help tackle the problem.”Her videos have attracted a toxic rhetoric directed at deprived areas with large BAME populations, she says. “Import the third world, and you get the third world” is one of many comments that frequently appear under her clips.“We know that there is a problem, absolutely. But we also know we are under-resourced, there’s a huge lack of investment,” she says. “It gives us a really bad reputation to say we’re all like this – to suggest we all want to live in a dirty place. We don’t. That’s not how we want to live at all. It was never like this when I moved here.”She has launched a petition to get the council to install more security cameras to clamp down on fly-tipping, and push to end the strike that has dragged on for so long. “Nobody should ever think this is normal,” she says. “We are the UK’s second city. It’s a disgrace. Everyone says we’re bankrupt or we’re poor. For goodness sake, the UK is in the G7. We should have enough money to be able to keep our streets clean.”This article was amended on 29 December 2025. An earlier version referred to striking bin workers wanting the council to reverse its decision to scrap the waste and recycling collection officer role. This was the original position taken by Unite, but is no longer the case.Explore more on these topicsWaste2025: what happened next?BirminghamIndustrial actionUniteTrade unionsRecyclingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He bought a 42-hectare stretch of farmland on the slopes and valleys of Wadi Salem, and formally registered the purchase with the Ottoman authorities, who then ruled the region.A few years later, after transferring the title to his son, Nassar did something even more extraordinary. He re-registered the deed under each successive administration – the British mandate, then the Jordanian government, and finally, after 1967, under Israeli occupation.Today, that ageing, yellowing document is one of the family’s few shields against the loss of their land – a plot that lies near the town of Nahalin in the so-called Area C of the Israeli-occupied West Bank,coveted by settlers and by far-right Israeli ministerseager to see it annexed. In 1991, the Israeli authorities began a legal battle to declare the Nassar family’s farm Israeli “state land”, a precursor to claiming it for occupation.A map of the West Bank.“I received this land as a gift,” says Daoud Nassar, 55, Daher’s grandchild, who now owns the farm with his family. “My grandfather gave it to my father, who gave it to me and to my brothers and sisters, and we intend to pass it on to our children, and to their children after them. For us Palestinians, the land is a gift – and a gift cannot be sold or given away.”Nestled in the olive-clad hills of the Judean desert, the Nassar farm survives without direct access to water or electricity – both were cut off by Israeli settlers in 1991 – with the family living partly in underground natural caves. It is the only place they are able to live, because since 1967 when the land was designed part of Area C, under full Israeli military and civil control, any structure – permanent or temporary – requires an Israeli permit. Almost none are granted.In this way, the family resists Israeli occupation while hemmed in by five illegal settler outposts – one built right up against its boundary – and locked in a 34-year legal battle with the army, forced to water each olive tree by hand, carrying two glasses of water at a time.To date, the legal battle between the Nassar family and the Israeli government is one of the longest-running cases in the history of theWest Bank, and the longest among those still pending.“Under Ottoman reign, Palestinian farmers and land owners did not register many of the lands, or reported reduced areas in order to avoid taxes, relying instead on oral traditions and local village records,” says Sliman Shaheen, a legal expert in land-related and demolition cases in the West Bank, who provides consultations to human rights organisations.“The central regime was not very strict in supervising the accuracy of the reported areas and was interested mainly in collecting tax by expanding agricultural land thus allowing for more tax collection.”As a result, Israel used the absence of such continuous registration to classify land as “state land” and take control of it, especially in Area C of the West Bank.View image in fullscreenAn international volunteer works on the Nassar family’s farm.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian“In the start of the 1980s the Israeli authorities started to use ‘state land’ declarations, in which above 900,000 donams (about 900 sq km) of lands were confiscated as state lands, under the commissioner of the governmental property,” says Shaheen. “Official data obtained from the Civil Administration through freedom of information requests,show that only 0.7%from state lands were allocated to Palestinians, while 37% of these lands were allocated to settlers.”Shaheen says the few Palestinians who brought cases before the objections committee – a military-run body that hears appeals against planning decisions – encountered an unfair process, with hearings conducted by IDF judges and no Palestinian representation.Although the Nassar family had duly registered their land, in 1991 they were served with a notice from Israeli authorities declaring the farmland “state land”, making it vulnerable to occupation.“Since then, we started a legal battle, which is still ongoing,” says Nassar. “We spent decades in front of a military court and years in front of the supreme court. We have registration documents from 1916 during the British mandate period. And then the Jordanian period and then even after 1967, after Israel occupied the West Bank. And ruling after ruling, the Israeli army is still appealing and asking us to re-register the land year after year.”“Daoud’s case is unique,” says Shaheen. “If someone has a Jordanian tabu [title deed] his ownership rights are considered definite even under Israeli occupation.”Despite the Israeli supreme court ruling on at least two separate occasions that the Nassar family’s land could not be expropriated, the Israeli military has continued to appeal in an effort to strip the family of the farm, which lies in an area deemed strategic by Israel.Since the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023, Israel has accelerated the seizure of land in the West Bank and established arecord number of new settlements. In response, dozens of Palestinian lawyers, acting on behalf of their clients, have travelled to Turkey in search of land ownership documents dating back to the Ottoman era.“Many of these title deeds were lost and retrieving them involved travelling to Turkey and searching the archives by a geographical area, but it is very costly and impractical for the majority of Palestinians,” says Shaheen.As now happens almost daily across the West Bank, alongside demolition orders, confiscations and military seizures, settlers also operate in a grey zone encouraged and protected by the Israeli authorities. They attack and vandalise Palestinian villages in an effort to force residents off their land.“The settlers attack us constantly,” says Nassar. “They destroy our water tanks where we store rainwater, build roads across our land, block access to the main gate, and uproot our olive trees and crops.”In 2002, a group of Israeli settlers uprooted more than 250 olive trees from the Nassar family’s farm. In 2014, the entire apricot harvest was destroyed.Farming the land in occupiedPalestineis not only a source of livelihood for thousands of families, but often an obligation: without continuous cultivation, land can be seized by the Israeli government and reclassified as “state land”.“If cultivation stops for a certain period, then the lease can expire since the land is uncultivated and if so and the land is reverted to the state,” says Shaheen.For this reason, since 2000 hundreds of volunteers from around the world have come to help the Nassar family farm their land as part of a project known as the Tent of Nations. Volunteers from Italy, the UK, France, Spain and the US are not only a visible presence and a form of protection against settler violence; they are also a vital workforce, without which it would be virtually impossible for the Palestinian family to care for their crops without access to water and electricity.View image in fullscreenGloria Ghetti, a schoolteacher from Italy, said she had to ‘get her hands dirty’ after reading about attacks by settlers on Palestinian communities.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianLast August, Gloria Ghetti, a schoolteacher from Faenza in northern Italy, travelled to the Nassar family’s farm to help water their struggling olive trees. What might sound like simple agricultural labour has proved gruelling: reliant solely on rainwater tanks, the family must irrigate hundreds of trees by hand, carrying water in 2-litre buckets to each individual tree under an unforgiving sun.“When I read about the attacks by settlers on Palestinian communities, I felt I had to do something,” Ghetti says. “I realised that if I wanted to stand against this injustice, I couldn’t just read about it from afar – I had to get my hands dirty.”The volunteers, together with members of the family, sleep in the natural caves where the Nassars lived for decades. One has been converted into a small chapel, where every Sunday a local parish priest celebrates mass.View image in fullscreenNassar inside a natural cave on his family’s farm that has been converted into a small chapel, where mass is celebrated every Sunday.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian“At first, sleeping in the caves was a tradition,” says Nassar. “They offered shelter from the heat and symbolised our attachment to the land. Now, however, it has also become a necessity, because Israel prevents us from building homes or even small structures on our own land.”A few months ago, Israeli settlers built an illegal outpost literally pressed up against the farm’s boundary fence – a clear provocation intended to push the family to breaking point and lure them into a misstep. If the Palestinians were to react, the Israeli military would have the pretext to lock them out of their land.“Faced with the settlers’ provocations, we had the option of responding with violence or presenting ourselves as victims,” says Nassar. “We refused to do either. Responding with violence is not part of our principles. Hatred is not part of who we are. But we could not simply stand by and watch. We chose to believe in justice.“They cut off our electricity, so we installed a solar system. They deny us access to water, and we rely instead on rainwater tanks.”The IDF did not reply to a request for comment regarding the attempts to confiscate the family’s land.Israel has consistently rejected accusations of ethnic cleansing from Israeli and international human rights organisations, including UN rapporteurs, dismissing them as fabricated propaganda. It also denies the colonisation of occupied territory by settlers is illegal under international law.Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestineFarmingMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He survived on food handouts from tourists shopping in the Zimbabwean resort town.View image in fullscreenThe film premiered at the Tribeca film festival in New York in June 2025.Photograph: HandoutFour years later, sick of being bullied and threatened, he asked a boxing coach to teach him the sport for self-defence – a decision that changed his life for ever.Today, Mupfuti is running theVictoria Falls Boxing Academy, training underprivileged children and sending them to school in a story that inspired the first Zimbabwean film to be considered for an Oscar.The short film, Rise, starring the Zimbabwe-born Hollywood actor Tongayi Chirisa, is based on the story of how Mupfuti’s life changed after meeting the coach.Just his humanity was a great privilege to try to portray. He is an impeccable individual, very deep, very nuancedTongayi ChirisaAfter learning to box, he started to train alone in the bush along the road to Victoria Falls airport in his early 20s. Several children started following him and he was offered the chance to use a classroom at Mosi-oa-Tunya high school as a boxing training facility.He later bought his own land and built a gym to give children like him a chance– nearly 5 million childrenlive in poverty in Zimbabwe, with 1.6 million in extreme poverty, according to Unicef.View image in fullscreenRise follows the story of young boy who lives on a rubbish dump and convinces Tobias, a reclusive boxing coach, to teach him to fight.Photograph: Jacques Naudé/RISEToday, about 40 children are training for free at the academy, and eight of those children also live there. Funding comes from well-wishers and a gym where adults pay a small fee.“The academy is helping underprivileged children to attend education, provide them with shelter and give them food,” says Mupfuti, 38.“We try by every means so that they do not have time to go to the streets. After training, they are tired; they do their homework and sleep.“It was not easy in the streets,” he remembers. “I thought of giving hope to those children rejected by their families.”Rise, written and directed by Jessica J Rowlands, who grew up in Victoria Falls, portrays the story of a charismatic young boy, Rise, played bySikhanyiso Ngwenya, who lives on a rubbish dump and convinces Tobias, a reclusive boxing coach, to teach him to fight to find safety and strength in the streets.The film, whichpremiered internationallyat the Tribeca film festival in New York in June 2025, has so far won 19 awards across the world. It was the first Zimbabwean film to be screened at the festival and the first to qualify to be considered for an Oscar, although it missed out on making the shortlist.View image in fullscreenFrom left to right: Tongayi Chirisa, the film’s director, Jessica Rowlands, Sikhanyiso Ngwenya, Tobias Mupfuti, and producer Joe Njagu.Photograph: Bryan Derballa/Getty ImagesChirisa, who plays Tobias, says spending time with Mupfuti helped him prepare for the role.“The real-life gentleman’s story is incredible,” he says. “A selfless man, a man of humility despite the hardships and the struggles that he’s had to overcome.“Just his humanity was a great privilege to try to portray. He is an impeccable individual, very deep, very nuanced and subtle.”Chirisa, who played Cheetor in Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, says Rise speaks to the need to nurture every child. “Rise’s character is similar to Tobias’s real-life experience. To find hope in a place of hopelessness is something that the story definitely extrapolated from,” he says.‘I was born a fighter’: the champion boxer changing young lives in ZimbabweRead moreMupfuti was heavily involved in the making of Rise, which was shot on location in the resort town, including at the majestic Victoria Falls and in Harare. He is credited as an executive producer.“He was pretty much involved in the entire process. He was at the set every minute of it. He is even a stunt double in the film for Chirisa. All the festivals, he has been there,” says Joe Njagu, Rise’s producer.“His involvement has helped shape the story. For it to be as authentic as possible.”Njagu, who also co-produced Cook Off, the first Zimbabwean film to be acquired by Netflix, says Rise adds to the efforts being made to get the Zimbabwean film industry going.“The [sector] in Zimbabwe has been transitioning from being a film community to becoming a film industry. It’s been a long journey. What Rise has done is leapfrog to where we are trying to get with big efforts like being the first film in Zimbabwe at theTribeca film festival,” he says.View image in fullscreenTongayi Chirisa, who plays the boxing coach, and Sikhanyiso Ngwenya in a scene from the film.Photograph: Jacques Naudé/RISEMeanwhile, Mupfuti has plans to expand the Victoria FallsBoxingAcademy to accommodate more homeless children.“Once I finish adding 10 more rooms, I will help more underprivileged kids,” he says.Bright Moyo met Mupfuti when he was 15 after his single mother, who works in Botswana, struggled to look after him.“If the academy had not paid for my fees, the chances were high that I would have been into drugs. Some of my friends are into drugs,” he says.“The academy is giving me hope.

In 2024, the north African state signed a new migration partnership with the European Union in exchange for €210m (£181m) in funding.A recent report by Human Rights Watch accused Mauritanian authorities of systematic abuses of the mainly African migrants, including rape and torture – accusations that the Mauritanian government rejects.The Caminando Fronteras report concludes that the Atlantic route from north Africa to the Canary Islands, which can take up to 12 days, remains the deadliest, with 1,906 fatalities this year. The increasingly popular route from Algeria to the Balearic Islands cost the lives of 1,037 migrants. The report also notes the emergence of a new route from Guinea to the Canaries, a distance of 2,200km.Maleno described a policy of “necropolitics” fuelled by far-right parties, saying “the persecution and witch-hunts of migrants is having a huge impact on human rights in Europe”.“The institutional response to tragedies at sea remains patently inadequate,” the report concludes. “Although there has been collaboration between countries in some cases, there are still worrying delays in mobilising rescue missions, a lack of adequate resources and limited political will to protect lives.”The 3,090 victims come from 30 countries, mostly in west and north Africa, but also Pakistan, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Iraq and Egypt.Explore more on these topicsSpainMigrationMauritaniaAfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Doctors decided to postpone the same procedure on the left side until Monday to mitigate potential risks.Brazilian president vows to veto bill cutting Jair Bolsonaro’s prison termRead more“Procedure completed. Thank God, we are now waiting for him to be taken back to his room,” wrote the former president’s wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, who has been accompanying him during his hospital stay. Earlier, she said: “It’s been nine months of struggle and anguish with daily hiccups.”Dr Claudio Birolini later told journalists that Bolsonaro was expected to be discharged on 1 January, provided his recovery remains uneventful.At the request of his defence lawyers, Bolsonaro was authorised by supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes to leave prison for the hernia surgery. In a statement issued while he was in the hospital, Bolsonaro endorsed the 2026 presidential bid of his son, Flavio Bolsonaro.Once discharged from the hospital, Bolsonaro will return to serving his sentence at a federal police jail in Brasilia.He has had health problems since he wasstabbed during a presidential campaign event in September 2018.Bolsonaro underwent multiple abdominal surgeries after the attack.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

They were built at double time, defying expectations to be at least partially inaugurated before the end of Amlo’s term – but also raising concerns over safety.Sunday’s derailment was the third incident on the Interoceanic Train this year, including one earlier this month when a train hit a truck at a crossing. The Mayan Train has also seen two non-fatal derailments.Alejandro Moreno, the leader of the opposition institutional revolutionary party (PRI), called for the construction and operation of all such projects to be paused whilea full audit was conducted.“This tragedy … demands immediate answers,” wrote the partyon X.Sheinbaum responded by insisting the train had operated with all safety requirements. “We will be very responsible in the construction and operation [of these projects], as we have always been,” she said.Explore more on these topicsMexicoClaudia SheinbaumAmericasTrain crashesnewsShareReuse this content"

Two nights ago, we knocked that out. So we hit them very hard,” TrumptoldRepublican donor and New York supermarket owner John Catsimatidis on Friday.Trump on Mondaywent furtherin his characterization of the strike, saying: “Well, it doesn’t matter. But there was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs. We hit the area.”Speaking after a meeting with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president said: “So we hit all the boats and now we hit the implementation area… where they implement and that’s no longer around.”Trump confirmed in October that he had authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct covert operations inVenezuela.“I authorized for two reasons really. Number one, they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America ... they came in through the border. They came in because we had an open border,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “And the other thing are drugs,” he added.If a US strike or covert action is confirmed, it will mark the first land strike on Venezuela since the Pentagon began abuildup of US strike forcesin region to interdict drug traffickers operating – theTrump administrationclaims – under the direction of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro.Trump’s claims to Venezuelan oil are part of broader ‘resource imperialism’, experts sayRead moreThe initial, stated purpose of the military buildup has since morphed into a blockade to disrupt thecountry’s oil exportsthat uses a global shadow fleet of oil tankers outside of Chevron, the single licensed exporter of Venezuelan oil.Trump has for weeks warned that US forces are ready to expand the military campaign by striking targets inside Venezuela, a tactic that would in theory require congressional authorization.Video footage posted onlineon 24 December appeared to show an explosion said to be from the industrial zone of the San Francisco municipality in Zulia state.However, the video or the facility has not been independently verified. An administration officialtold CNNthat the president was describing a drug facility in his comments to Catsimatidis.The Venezuelan government has not commented on the incident Trump described and there have been no independent reports from Venezuela of it.The buildup of US military in the region – a posture the White House calls amaritime “quarantine” around Venezuela– marks the most expansive maritime enforcement action of Trump’s presidency.Administration officials have stopped short of describing the action as a blockade but have acknowledged that about 15,000 personnel are positioned across the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, including a carrier strike group, F-35s and Coast Guard cutters to enforce existing sanctions.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpVenezuelaUS militaryAmericasTrump administrationUS politicsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

At least 89 warplanes – the largest daily tally for more than a year – were counted, and a formation of four amphibious assault ships, which can carry dozens of rotary aircraft, was spotted 160 nautical miles west of Taiwan’s southern tip.Map of the location of the military drillsCol Shi Yi, the spokesperson for the PLA’s eastern theatre command, said the drills were “a stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces”. A foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said unnamed “external parties” were pushing the region closer to war.“Any sinister schemes to obstruct China’s reunification are doomed to fail,” Lin said.China’s defence ministry said on Monday that “relevant countries”, a coded reference to the US, should “abandon illusions of using Taiwan to contain China”.While large military drills take extensive planning and are usually part of general training, the PLA often links them to perceived acts of provocation, and some propaganda on Monday specifically cited a recent approval by the US government for a record$11bn weapons sales to Taiwan.View image in fullscreenScreenshot from a video released by the PLA showing helicopters on an amphibious assault ship taking part in the military drills.Photograph: Eastern Theatre Command/ReutersAnalysts also noted Beijing’s recent anger at speeches by Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te,vowing to boost Taiwan’s defencesand achieve a “high level of combat preparedness” by 2027, and theongoing dispute with Japanafter its prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, said her country would most likely become militarily involved if China attacked Taiwan.Fu Zhengnan, a researcher at the PLA’s Academy of Military Science, was quoted by Chinese media as saying that the drills were justified by the recent US weapons sales and the fact that the goods bought included offensive as well as defensive equipment. “Despite repeated warnings from China, the US and Taiwan engaged in serious collusion and provocation. The PLA’s decisive action was a reasonable, legal and forced response,” Fu said.View image in fullscreenA Taiwanese air force Mirage 2000 fighter jet takes off from Hsinchu airbase in Taiwan on Monday.Photograph: Ritchie B Tongo/EPAArticles published in Chinese state media on Monday attacked US support for the “first island chain”, a string of islands in the western pacific that includes territories from Taiwan, Japan and the Philippines. The US has highlighted defence of the first island chain as a key security strategy.A propaganda poster depicted flaming arrows shot from China to Taiwan’s main island, piercing green bugs representing what Beijing terms separatist forces, while a foreign warship “flee[s] upon witnessing this scene”, the state media tabloid, the Global Times said.‘Ferryman of the souls’: the man who helps Taiwan’s dead return home to ChinaRead moreIn response to the drills, Taiwan accused Beijing of escalating tensions and undermining regional peace. It condemned the activity, saying it dispatched “appropriate forces” to respond and conduct counter-combat-readiness exercises of its own.“Defending democracy and freedom is no provocation, and the existence of the Republic of China [Taiwan’s formal name] is not an excuse for aggressors to disrupt the status quo,” the ministry said.Beijing claims Taiwan is a Chinese province and is preparing to militarily annex it, with the aim of being capable of invasion by 2027, according to US intelligence from several years ago.The Chinese Communist party (CCP) and its leader, Xi Jinping, haveurged Taiwan to accept “peaceful reunification”to avoid deadly force. However, the vast majority of Taiwan’s parliament and people reject the prospect of CCP rule, and Taiwan is boosting its own military defences in resistance.5:03How China uses ‘salami-slicing’ tactics to exert pressure on Taiwan - videoThe live-fire exercises covered a larger area than previous drills, according topublished maps of air and maritime warning areas, some of which overlap with Taiwan’s territorial border 12 nautical miles off its coast. Taiwan aviation authorities said more than 100,000 passengers on more than 850 scheduled international and domestic flights would be affected on Tuesday.Justice Mission 2025 is the sixth major PLA military exercise targeting Taiwan since 2022, when it launched days of live-fire drills in retaliation for the then US speaker, Nancy Pelosi, visiting the island. In April, it helda two-day operation labelled Strait Thunder-2025A, prompting expectations for a “B” before year’s end.Analysts said it was the first time the PLA had explicitly said it was practising deterring international involvement. Also unusually, a number of PLA aircraft remained visible on radar platforms.“That is a signal that the PLA is building up their anti-access/area denial capabilities, and publicly declaring it,” said William Yang, a senior north-east Asia analyst for the the non-profit International Crisis Group.Yang also noted it was the secondmajor exercise during the second term of the US president, Donald Trump, who met Xi in Octoberbut did not discuss Taiwan.Yang said: “Beijing will likely take into accountthe response from the US[to these drills] and carefully determine how it should formulate and plan the PLA’s military operation.”Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu and Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Not a lot. Actually less than I would’ve thought. But it’s there.”Official figures released by Beijing this month show China’s trade surplus reached more than $1tn in the year to November for the first time, as manufacturers shipped more to non-US markets to sidestep Trump’s tariffs.While exports to the US plummeted by 29% year-on-year, sales to markets elsewhere ballooned, including a 15% rise in exports to the EU and 9% jump to the UK compared with the same period a year earlier.In its November monetary policy report, the Bank said Chinese exports to the UK and euro area had increased, while those to the US had declined. “Early evidence suggests [tariffs] are having a relatively limited effect on global growth and a slightly disinflationary impact on the UK, driven mainly by trade diversion,” the report said.Headline inflation in the UK isrunning at 3.2%and is forecast to drop close to the 2% target set by the government by the middle of 2026. Measures inRachel Reeves’s autumn budget– including relief on energy bills and fuel duty – are expected tocut the headline rateby as much as 0.5 percentage points.This month the Bankcut its base rateby a quarter-point to 3.75% amid cooling inflationary pressures. Financial markets predict Threadneedle Street will probably reduce borrowing costs by at least another quarter-point in 2026 amid weaker levels of economic growth and rising unemployment.China ranks as the UK’s largest market for imports behind Germany, with £70bn shipped to Britain in the year to June, an increase of 4.1% from a year earlier.Cars, telecoms and sound equipment were the main imports.Millard said the impact on UK inflation from an increase in Chinese imports was unlikely to be large, but could still add to a slowdown in the headline inflation rate in 2026.“There is potential for a fall in the price of Chinese imports as they attempt to sell more into the UK, which could have a reasonable effect on our import price index,” he added.Diversion of Chinese exports has rung alarm bells for European manufacturers worried about being undercut by a cheap influx of goods, leading to pressure on EU leaders and the UK government to respond.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said after a visit to Beijing in December that the EU could beforced to take “strong measures”to curb a ballooning imbalance between Chinese imports and exports with the 27-nation bloc.In the UK, ministers have pledged to protect domestic steel producers from a mounting glut of the metal on global markets, much of which comes from subsidised Chinese producers.However, buyers could benefit from lower prices, with the potential to alleviate concerns over inflationary pressures re-emerging next year.Jack Meaning, the UK chief economist at Barclays, said there was limited evidence of trade diversion from China so far, but suggested import prices in the UK were on track to moderate in 2026 amid weaker growth in the world economy.“Our forecast is for core goods inflation to decelerate as we move through 2026, from about 1.5% in 2025 to below 1%,” he said. “Part of that story is a more global slowdown; a reorganising of excess demand in the global economy, coming into the UK as a small open economy.”Explore more on these topicsInflationInternational tradeTrade policyTariffsChinaAsia PacificTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

But this year it has made the headlines as a bear hotspot, as the country reels from a year of record ursine encounters and deaths, with warnings that winter will not bring immediate respite.“This year has been particularly bad,” says Kazuhide Otomo, an official in the town’s rural environment development division. “There have always been bears in this region, so people got used to them. But this year is different … it’s the biggest topic of conversation.”In Naruko Onsen, groups of hikers equipped withsuzubells and repellent spray head into the forest to catch the last of the autumn colours, while posters at the local tourism office warn visitors in multiple languages how to protect themselves.1:27Bells and whistles: how our reporter prepared for visiting bear hotspot – videoTourist numbers are lower than in a typical year, while localryokaninns say guests are cancelling their reservations.Satoru Onoma, who runs a coffee shop, admits he is experiencing bear fatigue after months of intense media coverage. “It’s hard to ignore the bear problem because it’s been all over the news,” he said, adding that he had not encountered the animals during his rare trips outside. “But I’ve heard plenty of stories about people spotting bears in the mountains.”Osaki authorities have reported 400 sightings so far this year, compared with fewer than 100 in 2024. In one incident, a woman in her 70s suffered serious injuries to her face when she was attacked outside her home after picking vegetables. In another, residents saw a bear grab and run off with their dog.Similar encounters have been reported in regions acrossJapan, with the northernmost prefectures at the centre of anunprecedented waveof attacks.Map showing the location of Osaki, a Japanese town which is best known for its Naruko Onsen hot springs and autumn foliage.Osaki is best known for its Naruko Onsen hot springs and autumn foliage.A record 13 people died in suspected bear maulings nationwide between April and November, according to the environment ministry, while the number of attacks stood at 197 – another high.Experts say hungry bears are venturing into residential and built-up areas in search of food after poor crops of acorns and beechnuts in their natural habitat.Japan’s bear population is growing, with one estimate putting the number of Asian black bears at 44,000 – compared with 15,000 estimated in 2012, although the species is identified as “vulnerable” on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s “red list” of threatened species. That figure does not include Hokkaido, thought to be home to about 12,000 Ussuri brown bears, whose population has more than doubled since 1990.Sightings have been reported on the western tip of the main island of Honshu, fuelling concern that the animals could appear on Kyushu – where they were previously thought to be extinct – which lies 650 metres away across the Kanmon Straits.The colder weather would once have eased fears, as the animals, fattened up on beechnuts and acorns, disappeared to hibernate until the spring. But their increasinglydesperate search for foodis forcing them to delay hibernation.The problem is compounded by a shortage of licensed hunters – many of whom are ageing and have little or no experience of killing bears – and the disappearance of naturalsatoyamaborders that separate forests from villages in ageing farming communities.View image in fullscreenA poster outside the tourist office in Naruko Onsen advises hikers on how to avoid encounters with bears, and what to do if they come across one of the animals.Photograph: Justin McCurry/The GuardianAs a result, northern prefectures are experiencing a surge in bear sightings even in December and January.Earlier this month an 80-year-old man – a member of a local hunting club – was found dead near a trapped bear on a mountain, according to police. Another man in his 70s was attacked as he cleared snow from in front of his home.Toshio Mizoguchi, an expert on bear countermeasures, told broadcaster NHK that between 2019 and 2023 the number of reported sightings in the region in December stood at between 30 to 50. That soared to 284 the following year, and has stayed consistent at 271 sightings so far this year – a phenomenon Mizoguchi attributed toprolonged searches for persimmonsas the animals load up on nutrients before hibernating.“Now black bears have begun invading even Japan’s urban spaces,” Maki Yamamoto, an associate professor at Nagaoka University of Technology who specialises in wildlife management, wrote on theNippon.comwebsite this month. “We must begin to approach wildlife management as a national policy issue rather than an isolated problem confined to remote mountain communities.”Authorities in Osaki declared a state of emergency they initially expected to lift at the end of November. The measures, though, will stay in place until the end of the year, as sightings continue. Residents are advised not to go out early in the morning or late at night – when they are more likely to encounter bears – and to strip their trees of persimmons and other fruit that are becoming part of the animals’ changing diet.“Bears are clever animals,” Otomo said. “If they find something good to eat, like a sweet persimmon, in a particular place they remember and keep going back for more. In the past, bears would often run away when they saw humans, but they are becoming accustomed to people and no longer see them as dangerous.”Public anxiety prompted the governor of Akita prefecture – where most sightings have been reported – tocall in the self-defence forcesto trap and dispose of bears, although they are not permitted to shoot them.View image in fullscreenTraditional kokeshi dolls outside the railway station at Naruko Onsen in northern Japan. The dolls, carved from a single piece of wood, are popular souvenirs for visitors to Japanese onsen resorts.Photograph: Justin McCurry/The GuardianThe prefecture’s governor, Kenta Suzuki, said he had taken the unprecedented step after four people were killed and 62 others injured in attacks. “One of the characteristics of this year is that these incidents are taking place in urban areas,” he said, adding that the prefecture had culled more than 2,000 bears this year.“We’re hearing about people opening their front doors to find a bear on their doorstep, or roaming in their garden,” he said. “The fact that this is happening near people’s homes is causing high levels of fear.“We’ve been criticised for our decision to cull a large number of bears, but we’re not doing this because we want to … it’s because of the damage they are causing in urban areas and to agriculture. It’s unavoidable.”In Osaki, residents hope 2026 could bring relief, since poor beechnut harvests appear to occur in two-year cycles – a phenomenon some scientists have attributed to theclimate crisisand intense summer heat. If the pattern persists, there should be plenty of food, and far fewer hungry bears roaming towns and villages next year.But it also means that the following year could see a return to more frequent sightings, injuries and deaths.“It’s about striking a balance between protecting residents and preserving bears’ natural habitats,” Otomo said. “We have to make sure there is a clear division between the bear and human populations. But as long as bears continue to lose their fear of people, the problem won’t go away.”Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The Asahi said the walkway, installed six years ago, is only 60cm wide and does not have handrails.In addition, officials at the Asari ski resort told Kyodo that its safety mechanism appeared to have failed after the boy’s mother pressed the emergency stop button.The mechanism, which is triggered when a foreign object becomes trapped, had worked during a routine inspection earlier in the day, according to Kyodo. Media reports said no staff members were on duty near the travelator when Hinata fell.A representative of the resort apologised for the accident, while police in Hokkaido launched an investigation, which media reports said could result in charges of professional negligence resulting in death.A man in his 70s who visits the resort regularly described the travelator as “scary”. He told Kyodo that changes in the angle of the slope cause the conveyer belt to shake, adding that he had also stumbled while travelling on it.A man who works near the popular resort told the Asahi: “Many children use the resort to practise skiing. I hope there will be a proper investigation and measures to ensure something like this never happens again.”Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The act wascaught on cameraand shared around the world.“My target was just to take the gun from him, and to stop him from killing a human being’s life and not killing innocent people,” he said.“I know I saved lots, but I feel sorry for the lost.”Police with machine guns at Sydney New Year’s Eve are part of ‘fundamental changes’ after Bondi, Minns saysRead moreAkram was shot dead by police during the attack on a Hanukah event where 15 people were killed. His son, Naveed Akram, was wounded by police, and he was later charged with 59 offences.Footage from the attack shows Ahmed leaping from behind a parked car to grapple with Sajid Akram, whose gun was knocked to the ground in the struggle. Ahmed picked it up and pointed it at the gunman, who retreated to his son on a nearby footbridge.“I jumped in his back, hit him. I hold him with my right hand and start saying a word, you know, like to warn him: ‘Drop your gun, stop doing what you’re doing,’” Ahmed told CBS of his struggle with the gunman.“And emotionally, I’m doing something, which is I feel something, a power in my body, my brain … I don’t want to see people killed in front of me, I don’t want to hear his gun, I don’t want to see people screaming and begging, asking for help, and that’s my soul asking me to do that.”0:47Alleged gunman tackled during Bondi beach shooting – videoAhmed said he did not consider shooting the disarmed gunman. “I didn’t think to shoot. I don’t want to put my hand in blood. I don’t think I am the one who can take life of people.”There was no time to worry about the other gunman, he said. “I didn’t worry about anything. I was just, my target was just, to take the gun from him and to stop him from killing a human being.”Ahmed, 44, was shot five times shortly after wrestling with Akram. He is recovering well after going through three rounds of surgery in aSydneyhospital, according to a member of the local Syrian-Australian community whovisited him last week.He also told CBS: “Everything in my heart, in my brain, everything, it’s worked just to manage to save the people’s life.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAhmed, a tobacco shop owner from Sydney’s south, had been getting coffee with his cousin when the shooting started.His actions have beenwidely praised, with the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, visiting him in hospital and filmed telling him: “Your heart is strong, your courage is inspiring.”Last week, the media director for the Australians for Syria Association, Lubaba Alhmidi AlKahil, said Ahmed’s left arm was not expected to regain normal function for at least six months because of his injured nerves.It was unlikely his Sutherland shop, where hundreds of people have left notes and flowers paying tribute, would reopen soon. Instead, he would rest and recover and spend time with family, AlKahil said.“He needs to get rest, he needs to spend time with his family, he has been away from his wife and daughters for a long time,” she said.Family members have watched over Ahmed as he has recovered and been visited by well-wishers and dignitaries.“He said that a lot of people from the government, from different backgrounds, different religions, different ethnicities, visited him and congratulated him,” AlKahil said.“He’s very happy, he feels very peaceful.”Visitors have also included the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns; the Australian governor general, Sam Mostyn, who passed on personal thanks from King Charles; and David Ossip, the president of NSW’s Jewish Board of Deputies.A fundraiser for Ahmed via GoFundMe has raised $2.5m.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackSydneynewsShareReuse this content"

That includes 130 grey-headed flying foxes, listed as vulnerable under federal environment laws, along with 700 black and 800 little red flying foxes.A three-year phaseout was announced in 2023 and was due to conclude by 1 July 2026, after which shooting would no longer be allowed. The long lead time was intended to give farmers time to move to non-lethal alternatives, such as exclusion netting, which creates a physical barrier between bats and produce.However, the state quietlyreversed course in December, revoking the ban.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailLawrence Pope, a spokesperson for the Friends of Bats & Bushcare, said the shooting of flying foxes was “barbaric”, given many animals died slowly, and females carrying pups were often “cruelly smashed by pellets”. He added that while endangered spectacled flying foxes were not part of the quota, they were at risk due to the difficulty in reliably distinguishing different species at night.Pope said the “unexpected step backwards” was made without consulting conservationists or environment groups.Animpact analysisindicated the department had consulted with local governments and industry.A spokesperson for the Department of the Environment, Tourism, Science and Innovation saidflying fox damage mitigation permits – which allow the “lethal take” of flying foxes by shooting – would remain available “to support farmers in protecting commercial fruit crops” where “all other management options have been exhausted or are unavailable”.According to the department, any person who has held a permit since 1 September 2012 could apply for permission to shoot the animals provided they had attempted at least two non-lethal methods.Four species, 160 days, 50,000 images: meet the photographer dedicated to showing the lovable side of flying foxesRead moreMore than 20,000 flying foxes have been shot under the program over 10 years, according to Queensland government datasupplied to the ABC.The Australasian Bat Societystrongly objectedto the shooting of flying foxes, which it described as ineffective at reducing crop damage and inhumane given “the likelihood of a clean, instantaneous kill is low and the majority of animals that are shot experience a slow death”.In a position statement on its website, the society said fruit ripening coincided with flying fox breeding season, which meant females were often shot when pregnant or nursing young. “If a female is killed or injured so that she cannot return to the flying fox camp, her single young, which depends on her milk, will die slowly over a number of days.”Jenny Mclean at the Tolga Bat hospital in Queensland’s Atherton Tablelands said farmers had three years under the phaseout to “get their act into gear” and install exclusion netting, which many good growers had done. “If they can’t afford netting, they shouldn’t be growing fruit crops.”Rebecca Appleton, who works as an educator and rescuer with Bat Conservation and Rescue Queensland, said exclusion netting was effective at protecting crops without killing bats.“We would ask the government to invest more in helping the remaining farms to get that set up, [rather] than continue to allow shooting,” she said. “Better for farmers and bats – everyone wins.”Industry groups were contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsQueenslandAustralian climate and environment in focusQueensland politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But with a well-led Commonwealth royal commission and strong action, you may be able to save many more,” the letter signed by families of 11 of the 15 victims read.Albanese might have been able to rebuff Sussan Ley’s Coalition, Jewish leaders and many others who have demanded a national inquiry, but could he resist the heartfelt calls from relatives of the deceased?Yes.The terms of references, Albanese revealed in the next breath, were not for a royal commission but rather the former spy chiefDennis Richardson’s review of federal intelligence agencies, which was first announced a week after the 14 December massacre.Albanese rejects calls for federal royal commission by families of Bondi beach terror attack victimsRead moreThe Richardson review will assess the overall performance and capacity of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) and Australian federal police (AFP) and examine specific, pertinent questions, including what was known, and when, of Sajid and Naveed Akram before the father and son allegedly killed 15 people and injured dozens of others.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIt would not consider – as the Coalition, the victims’ families and others have demanded – the broader issue of antisemitism.The inquiry will be wrapped up in April, allowing the federal government to move quickly to implement any urgent recommendations.For that reason alone, it is worthwhile and necessary.But such a narrow inquiry is not a substitute for a commonwealth royal commission, with the powers it has to compel evidence and, just as crucially, the national public spotlight it commands to ensure accountability.Richardson has been assured “full access to all materials he considers may be relevant to his inquiry”, according to the terms of reference. But his work, which will presumably include interrogation of the Asio boss, Mike Burgess, will be conducted in secret.After previously dismissing a royal commission on the grounds it would take too long, or that the Coalition’s proposed terms of reference were too wide-ranging, Albanese and the home affairs minister,Tony Burke, presented a new argument on Monday.Burke suggested a royal commission that examined antisemitism would provide a new platform for perpetrators of anti-Jewish hate, forcing grieving communities to “relive” the trauma of the past two years.“We need to have the sort of inquiry that keeps Australians safe and that does not provide a platform for the worst voices. The Richardson inquiry does exactly that,” Burke said.Burke’s desire to avoid further traumatising the Jewish community might be well intentioned. But the argument is undermined by the fact that some of the most traumatised – the families of the Bondi victims – are among those demanding a public inquiry.1:20'No royal commission after Port Arthur': PM stands firm against Bondi shooting commission – videoIf the risk of re-traumatisation was reason enough not to hold a royal commission, would the harrowing but necessary inquiry into institutional responses to child sexual abuse have been held?Royal commissions can hold sessions in private and submissions can be redacted or withheld from public release, including any sensitive intelligence or national security matters.Nobody is suggesting neo-Nazis be allowed to spew hatred from the witness box.Albanese has rightly rejected the Coalition’s suggestedterms of reference, which would amount to an unruly examination of universities, the media and even the Human Rights Commission.But that is not a legitimate reason to refuse an inquiry, because it is Albanese, not Ley, who decides its scope. Nor is the fact that New South Wales has committed to its own state-based inquiry.Asked bluntly if all of those calling for a royal commission were simply wrong, the prime minister insisted he was acting in the national interest.“Well, my heart breaks for the families of the victims of the Bondi terrorist atrocity,” he said.“My job as the Australian prime minister is to act in the national interest. It is in the national interest for us to do the Richardson review on national security.”In the fortnight since the Bondi shootings, Albanese has instigated a nationwide tightening of gun laws, including thefirst firearm buyback since Port Arthur, and promised stronger hate speech laws as part of a renewed effort to stamp out antisemitism.The responses might have been slower and more uncoordinated than his critics have demanded. But, in simple terms, he got there in the end.It appeared for a moment that he would get there too on holding a royal commission into Australia’s worst-ever terrorist attack.That he didn’t – and seemingly won’t – is becoming harder to understand and defend, and easier for political opponents to attack.“Australians turning on their televisions in the middle of their holidays may well have seen the last two Australians who do not support a royal commission into antisemitism and the Bondi terrorist attack,” Ley said, referring to Albanese and Burke.“Unfortunately, one of those people is the prime minister, who is the only person who can establish a royal commission.”In Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, andGrieflineon 1300 845 745Dan Jervis-Bardy is the chief political correspondent for Guardian AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAnthony AlbaneseBondi beach terror attackAustralian politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

He said Russia was “at it again” and using “dangerous statements” to undermine “diplomatic efforts” with the US to end the conflict.He added: “This alleged ‘residence strike’ story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks againstUkraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war.”Ukraine’s president warned that a strike on a main government complex in its capital was likely, similar to Russia’s bombing in September of the cabinet ministers’ building in central Kyiv.Earlier, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov,claimedUkraine had tried to hit Putin’s residence in the Novgorod region, south of St Petersburg. As a result Moscow’s negotiating position would be reviewed, he said.0:29Russia strikes Kyiv before Zelenskyy's meeting with Trump – videoLavrov said Russian air defences had shot down 91 incoming drones. “Such reckless actions will not go unanswered,” he added, denouncing what he called “state terrorism”. Targets for retaliatory strikes against Ukraine had already been selected, he said.The Kremlin’s latest bellicose threat appeared to be part of a KGB-style informational campaign directed at Russians and an impressionable White House. The Russian presidential adviser Yuri Ushakov claimed Putin briefed Trump about the alleged attack when they spoke on Monday.Trump was “shocked” at the news, Ushakov claimed, with Russian officials alleging that Britain was also involved in what he described as “provocations”.Ushakov’s characterisation of Trump rang true when, speaking at Mar-a-Lago on Monday afternoon, the US president told reporters the news made him “very angry”. “I don’t like it. It’s not good,” Trump said when asked if he was worried it could affect his efforts to broker peace.“I learned about it from President Putin today,” he said, adding: “It’s a delicate period of time. This is not the right time. It’s one thing to be offensive, because they’re offensive. It’s another thing to attack his house. It’s not the right time to do any of that.”When asked if there was any evidence of such an attack, Trump said: “We’ll find out.”Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, described the conversation between him and Putin as “positive”. It followed a lengthy call between the two leaders on Saturday.Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Moscow was using the old tactic of accusing the other side of“what you are doing or planning yourself”. He pointed out that Kyiv only hits “legitimate military targets” on enemy territory and was defending itself from Russian aggression.Earlier Zelenskyy said the US had offered “strong” security guarantees to Ukraine for 15 years, but acknowledged that the future of the country’s eastern Donbas region was unresolved after talks with Trump at the US president’s Mar-a-Lago residence.Speaking on his way back toEurope, Zelenskyy said the US Congress and Ukraine’s parliament would jointly vote on American pledges. These were a key part of a 20-point peace plan discussed with the US president, he said.The guarantees are seen by Kyiv as crucial to deter further Russian aggression in the event of a peace deal. Zelenskyy admitted that previous promises – including the US and UK-backed 1994Budapest memorandumguaranteeing Ukraine’s borders – “did not work”.The details of the latest US commitments remain unclear. Trump has ruled out deploying peacekeeping troops. Zelenskyy said the presence of international monitors in a postwar Ukraine was the best form of security and would provide reassurance to the country’s citizens.Ukraine’s president added: “We would really like the guarantees to be longer. I told him [Trump] that we would like to consider guarantees for 30, 40, or even 50 years, and that would be a historic decision by President Trump. The president said he would think about it.”Is claim Ukraine deal is ‘95% done’ just another empty assertion from Trump?Read moreAt a joint press conference on Sunday evening Trump claimed a deal to end the warwas “closer than ever”. In reality, the two sides remain far apart, with the Kremlin insisting on Monday that Ukraine had to withdraw its troops from a “fortress belt” of cities in Donetsk oblast.Vladimir Putin’s press spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said if Kyiv did not strike a deal it would lose more territory. He refused to comment on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, occupied by Moscow since its 2022 full-scale invasion and another sticking point in the negotiations.Zelenskyy ruled out giving land to Russia. “It’s no secret Russia wants this. In their fantasies, they would like us not to exist on the territory of our own country at all,” he said. He instead proposed a demilitarised and free economic zone along the existing frontline, with both sides pulling back their troops.The plan could be put to the Ukrainian people in a referendum, which would take place if Russia agreed to a ceasefire lasting for at least 60 days. Zelenskyy described a possible national vote as a “powerful tool” that would be an “expression of the Ukrainian people’s will”.Trump spoke to European leaders on Sunday by video call from Mar-a-Lago. Zelenskyy said he expected to hold talks with them in Europe in the coming days, with a joint follow-up meeting with Trump likely to take place in January, probably at the White House.0:29'Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed': watch Zelenskyy react to Trump's claimTalks on Sunday between the US and Ukrainian delegations were “great” and “substantive”, Zelenskyy said.Ukrainian commenters expressed relief on Monday that there was not a repeat at the Mar-a-Lago meeting of the humiliating scenes in February when Trump threw Zelenskyy out of the Oval Office.But they were scathing about some of Trump’s remarks, including his dubious claim that “Russia wants to see a very successful Ukraine”. They noted that the US president refused to condemn the Kremlin’s large-scale air attack on Kyiv over the weekend, involving more than 500 drones, saying: “Ukraine has made very strong attacks as well.”‪Maria Popova‬, an associate professor of political science at McGill University in Canada,said on Blueskythat Trump “sounded again like a Putin sock puppet” in his Mar-a-Lago press conference. She pointed out Trump had held a long phone call with Putin just ahead of his meeting with Zelenskyy, adding that the US president’s mind was “freshly full of Russian propaganda”.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaEuropeDonald TrumpUS foreign policyVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

Her AfD has for years worked to buildcloser ties to Donald Trump’s Maga movement.The MSC brings together heads of state and government, foreign and defence ministers and top military brass from around the world for a weekend of public addresses and private consultations.The previous no-AfD policy was adopted by the then MSC chair, Christoph Heusgen, a longtime adviser of the former chancellor Angela Merkel. The event has since chosen a new leader, the ex-Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg. But while Stoltenberg finishes his term as Norwegian finance minister, Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the US and to Britain and longtime MSC leader, has taken the reins.Before the MSC’s announcement, Alexander Hoffmann, the head of the parliamentary group of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of the chancellor Friedrich Merz’s Christian Democratic Union, warned against inviting the AfD, noting several of its officials had close contacts with Russia and China.“Information also flows there and that’s why it would be a security risk,” he told the dpa news agency.Kai Arzheimer, a political scientist at the University of Mainz, said Ischinger’s reasoning was unclear.“Perhaps he genuinely believes that this will enable him to avoid further intervention by the US government,” he said. “A more pessimistic interpretation would be that this is another step towards normalising the party and that at least some institutions are anticipating the AfD’s participation in government.”The political consultant Johannes Hillje said without an “official explanation” of the MSC’s new stance, “it looks like a capitulation toJD Vanceand his criticism of the exclusion of the AfD”.The AfD “is more extreme than other western rightwing populist parties, which is why the German state cannot treat it like any other party”, Hillje said.He said if AfD lawmakers were at the main conference, they should be excluded from “sensitive events” on the sidelines which could give them access to “confidential information” they could pass on to “contacts in Russia”.However, Thorsten Benner, the director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a Berlin-based thinktank, noted the MSC routinely invited a “large Chinese delegation” without raising eyebrows and did not see a security threat in including the AfD MPs in the main conference.“The MSC sees itself as a forum with a strong Republican presence. The bottom line for this forum is that it’s smarter not give Vance & the AfD the opportunity to present (the party) as victims,” he wrote on the social media platform Bluesky.The Guardian understands that the invitation extended to AfD MPs is for the main conference and not other “confidential formats” hosted by the MSC.The MSC’s about-face comes amid a heated debate in Germany about how to contain the AfD as it grows in strength. The party tookmore than one in five votes at the last national electionto become the leading opposition party in parliament.The “firewall” barring mainstream parties from working with the AfDhas ensured that the far right has been blocked from joining a government at the federal or state level. However, in 2026 there will be five regional elections across Germany, and the AfD hasstrong leads in the polls in two of them.Germany’s domestic intelligence service in Mayclassed the AfD as a “confirmed rightwing extremist” force, although that designation is still under official review.Explore more on these topicsAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)GermanyThe far rightJD VanceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

According to an exit poll by Ubo Consulting, 61.7% of people from the diaspora voted for Kurti’s party.Tahir Shabani, 58, who lives in Germany but returned to Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, to vote, said: “We are tired of this nine-month blockade that has cost us our nerves, cost Kosovo millions of euros, and set back our development. With this result there is a solution, which is why we are happy,.”Still, others wanted to see immediate changes after the impasse, especially in the quality of life, healthcare, and education. Skender Halimi, 52, who voted in Pristina, said: “Institutions must be established and the state must continue to function. We have a lot of work to do, just as the prime minister said. The budget must be approved, we must approve international agreements, and progress must be made“.”Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 with US backingafter the 1998-99 war that ended in a Nato bombing campaign against Serbian forces trying to crush an uprising by the 90% ethnic Albanian majority.Despite international support, the country of 1.6 million has struggled with poverty, instability and organised crime. While more than 100 countries recognise Kosovo’s statehood, Serbia, Greece, Spain, Russia and many others do not.Tensions with Serbiaflared violently in 2023, prompting the EU to impose sanctions on Kosovo – in part due to Kurti’s policies against the Serb minority that live in northern Kosovo. The measures are likely to have cost Kosovo hundreds of millions of euros.While that damaged Kurti’s reputation at home and abroad, as campaigning began this month the EU said it would lift sanctions.Deda said: “I think the electorate interpreted it as a sign that there are no problems between the Kurti government and the west.”Explore more on these topicsKosovoEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But they have to disarm within a fairly short period of time.”He described the question of Israel withdrawing its forces as “a separate subject”, adding only: “We’ll talk about that.”Into the void: how Trump killed international lawRead moreLast week the US news outlet Axios reported that theTrump administrationwanted to announce the Palestinian technocratic government for Gaza and the ISF as soon as possible and that senior Trump officials were growing exasperated “as Netanyahu has taken steps to undermine the fragile ceasefire and stall the peace process”.But Trump himself appeared to show no such qualms after Monday’s meeting. He said he was “not concerned about anything that Israel is doing” and “Israel has lived up to the plan, 100%”.He repeatedly pointed the finger at Hamas, saying “it’ll be horrible for them” if they failed to disarm. “It’s going to be really, really bad for them, and I don’t want that to happen. But they made an agreement that they were going to disarm. And you couldn’t blame Israel,” he said.Hamas retains large quantities of small arms but only a fraction of the heavy weapons that enabled its surprise attack into southern Israel in 2023, in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 250 abducted.More than 70,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed in the ensuing Israeli offensive and vast swathes of Gaza reduced to ruins. About 400 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli firesince the October ceasefire.In recent weeks, Hamas has successfully established its authority over the parts of Gaza it controls with a series of executions,raidsand beatings targeting rival power brokers, collaborators with Israel and criminal gangs. Most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is said to now live in the Hamas-controlled zone.The Islamist militant organisation has proposed some solutions to allow some of its weapons to be put into storage but has refused to accept full disarmament.Hamas’s armed wing reiterated on Monday that it would not surrender its weapons.“Our people are defending themselves and will not give up their weapons as long as the occupation remains,” the new spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, who has adopted the name of his late predecessor Abu Obeida, said in a video statement.Trump claimed that other countries that supported the peace deal would “go in and wipe out Hamas” if it fails to hold up its end of the bargain.View image in fullscreenPeople attend a rally earlier this month calling for the return of the remains of Ran Gvili in Tel Aviv, Israel.Photograph: Maya Levin/APTrump and Netanyahu earlier held a lunch meeting inside Mar-a-Lago along with their delegations. Netanyahu was expected to tell Trump that Hamas must return the remains of the last Israeli hostage left in Gaza before the next stages of the stalled ceasefire can be implemented, Israeli officials and analysts said.Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Trump falsely said “just about” every hostage was released because of him and his team, whereas “none” were released during the Joe Biden administration. In fact, Hamas released a total of 138 hostages as a result of deals that Biden’s administration helped broker, according to the Snopes factchecking site.The family of the last person whose remains have not been returned, Ran Gvili, has joined the Israeli prime minister’s visiting entourage and will meet officials in Washington later this week.Peace, power and profit – the logic behind Donald Trump’s dealmaking diplomacyRead moreAn Israeli official in Netanyahu’s circle told Reuters that the prime minister would demand that Hamas return the remains of all hostages in Gaza, as required under the ceasefire deal, before moving to the next stages of Trump’s plan.A second phase of the peace plan calls for an interim authority made up of non-aligned Palestinian technocrats to govern the Palestinian territory, and an international stabilisation force (ISF) of thousands of troops to be deployed. Israel has significant concerns about both.Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer, was badly wounded and then abducted during the October 2023 Hamas raid into Israel that triggered the conflict. It is unclear if he died of his wounds during the raid or in Gaza.Hundreds gathered on Saturday nightin Tel Aviv to demand that Israel makes no concession to advance the ceasefire deal until his remains are returned.Lianne Pollak-David, a former Israeli military intelligence officer and peace negotiator in the prime minister’s office, said the failure to return the remains of Gvili was a serious issue. “Netanyahu and the Israelis as a people are simply not going to accept this,” she said.Hamas has freed 20 living hostages and returned the bodies of 27 dead hostages since October and some observers see the insistence on Gvili’s remains being returned as a delaying tactic to allow Israel’s military forces to remain in the 53% of Gaza they currently control.Daniel Levy, a UK-based analyst and former Israeli peace negotiator, said Netanyahu had no intention of withdrawing further from Gaza or allowing any international force that would deter Israeli military action.“He feels he has a number of cards to play yet and the remains of Gvili is the easiest one to play now but there are others,” Levy said.For Netanyahu, who faces an election within 10 months, the prospect of Iran repairing the damage inflicted on its nuclear programme in its short war with Israel and the US this summer and building up its ballistic missile capabilities is another priority.Trump had previously insisted that Iran’s nuclear capabilities were “completely and fully obliterated”. But on Monday he said: “I hope they’re not trying to build up again because, if they are, we’re going to have no choice but very quickly to eradicate that buildup.”The president added: “Iran may be behaving badly. It hasn’t been confirmed. But if it’s confirmed, look, they know the consequences will be very powerful, maybe more powerful than the last time.” Pressed for evidence, he said: “This is just what we hear, but usually where there’s smoke, there’s fire.”‘Yellow line’ that divides Gaza under Trump plan is ‘new border’ for Israel, says military chiefRead moreThe Israeli prime minister may be hoping for a political boost from his latest meeting with Trump, whom he again praised as Israel’s greatest friend. Netanyahu said: “We decided to break a convention – or create a new one – and that is to award the Israel prize, which in almost our 80 years we’ve never awarded it to a non-Israeli, and we’re going to award it this year to President Trump…for his tremendous contributions to Israel and the Jewish people.”It was a second consolation prize for Trump, whomissed outon this year’s Nobel peace prize but received aFifa peace prize– dismissed by critics as a cynical ploy by world football’s governing body to curry favour.As if returning the compliment, Trump claimed he had spoken to the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, who told him that a pardon for Netanyahu in his long-running corruption trial was “on its way”. Trump said: “He’s a wartime prime minister who’s a hero. How do you not give a pardon?”Asked about Trump’s remarks, Herzog’s office said the Israeli president had not had any conversations with Trump since a pardon request was submitted several weeks ago, Reuters reported.Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpIsraelHamasGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Though the terms agreed for an initial phase have been largely completed, with Israel’s forces pulling back to new positions and Hamas releasing all living and all but one of the dead hostages, immense challenges face the implementation of the second phase of the president’s 20-point plan.After warmly greeting Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago, Trump told reporters that he hopes to reach phase two of theGazaplan “very quickly” but warned “there has to be a disarming of Hama”. The president also lied by claiming that “just about” every hostage was released because of him and his team, whereas “none” was released during the Joe Biden administration.There are fears Israel will launch new offensives againstHezbollahin Lebanon, breaking a ceasefire established more than a year ago, or against Iran, which it accuses of accelerating the manufacture of ballistic missiles in recent months.Asked about the prospect of a fresh attack onIran, Trump said: “I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down – we’ll knock them down, we’ll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that’s not happening. I heard Iran wants to make a deal. If they want to make a deal, that’s much smarter. You know, they could have made a deal the last time, before we did a big attack on them.”The Israeli prime minister is making his fifth visit to see Trump in the US this year. The leaders lavished praise on each other, signalling a desire to move past recent friction between the two countries. Netanyahu said: “We’ve never had a friend like President Trump in the White House. It’s not even close.”Trump said Netanyahu had done a “phenomenal job” and “Israel wouldn’t exist without him”. He also claimed he had spoken to the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, who told him that a pardon for Netanyahu in his long-running corruption trial was “on its way”. Trump said: “He’s a wartime prime minister who’s a hero. How do you not give a pardon?”Israel strikes southern Lebanon as deadline to disarm Hezbollah nearsRead moreGershon Baskin, the co-head of the peace-building commission at the Alliance for Two States, who has taken part in back-channel negotiations with Hamas, said the timing of Netanyahu’s trip was “very significant” for Gaza.“Phase 1 is basically over, there’s one remaining Israeli deceased hostage which [Hamas] are having difficulty finding,” he said.Both sides accuse each other of ceasefire violations. Hamas has failed explicitly to commit to disarmament and has had considerable success in imposing its authority in the parts of Gaza where almost all the population is concentrated. Israel appears reluctant to withdraw from the 53% of Gaza it now controls or to allow free passage of aid into the territory.“Phase 2 has to begin … and I think the Americans realise that it’s late because Hamas has had too much time to re-establish its presence and this is certainly not a situation that the Americans want to leave in place,” Baskin said.More than 70,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, died in Gaza during the war and almost all the territory’s 2.3 million population was displaced.About 400 Palestinians have diedin Gaza since the October ceasefire, and huge numbers continue to live in conditions of acute hardship.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump talks with Benjamin Netanyahu at the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, in October.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/APIn recent weeks, heavy rain and cold temperatures have compounded the suffering in Gaza, where most housing and infrastructure have been badly damaged or razed.The war was triggered by a surprise attack by Hamas in southern Israel in 2023, in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 250 others abducted.Under the next stages of Trump’s plan, an interim authority made up of nonaligned Palestinian technocrats is to govern the Palestinian territory instead of Hamas and an international stabilisation force (ISF) of thousands of troops is to be deployed.Hamas’s armed wing reiterated on Monday that it would not surrender its weapons.“Our people are defending themselves and will not give up their weapons as long as the occupation remains,” the new spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, who has adopted the name of his late predecessor Abu Obeida, said in a video statement.US officials have suggested the composition of the new authority could be announced in January.On Friday, theUS news outlet Axiosreported senior Trump officials were growing frustrated “as Netanyahu has taken steps to undermine the fragile ceasefire and stall the peace process”. Analysts in Israel and overseas agree.“There are more and more signs that the American administration is getting frustrated with Netanyahu,” said Yossi Mekelberg, a Middle East expert at the London-based thinktank Chatham House.“The question is what it’s going to do about it, because phase 2 is right now going nowhere,” Mekelberg added.For Netanyahu, a priority will be convincing Trump to allow Israel to act to prevent Iran from repairing the damage inflicted on its nuclear programme in its short war with Israel and the US this summer, or building its ballistic missile capabilities.The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said on Saturday that his country was in a full-scale war with the US, Israel and Europe. He added that the conflict was “more complicated and more difficult” than the Iran-Iraq war, which left more than 1 million casualties on both sides.UK, Canada and Germany condemn Israel for 19 new West Bank settlementsRead moreMeanwhile, efforts to secure a security agreement between Israel and Syria have failed to make significant progress and will also be on the agenda at Mar-a-Lago, local media in Israel said. Israeli officials have also called for more effective efforts to disarm Hezbollah in accordance with the 2024 ceasefire inLebanon.Standing alongside Netanyahu on Monday, Trump commented: “The new president ofSyriais working very hard to do a good job, he really is… You’re not going to get a choir boy to lead Syria … So, I hope they’re going to get along.”Netanyahu faces an election within 10 months, and the looming polls will influence his agenda, Mekelberg said. “Everything is connected to [his] staying in power,” he said.Pollsshow Netanyahu’s current coalitionwould struggle to form a government if elections were held now, with many voters angry over the failures that led to the Hamas raid of 2023, moves to continue the exemption of most ultra-Orthodox Jewish men from compulsory military service in Israel and a series of scandals among other issues.A close relationship with Trump would reinforce Netanyahu’s appeal among undecided voters and his base, and this suggests any public disagreement between the two leaders is extremely unlikely, analysts said.Netanyahu is expected to seek to convince Trump of the need for Israel, which relies on the US for many of its defence needs, to maintain a military technological edge over potential regional enemies. Many Israeli officials were shaken when Trump said this year that he would allow the sale of F-35 fighter planes to Saudi Arabia, which he described as a“great ally”. The state-of-the-art stealth aircraft was key to Israel’s successes against Iran in this summer’s war.Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpGazaIsrael-Gaza warLebanonHezbollahnewsShareReuse this content"

What has happened?What did Abd el-Fattah say and when?Most of the social media posts in question were written on X between 2010 and 2012 during the Arab spring, when the British-Egyptian democracy activist was turning 30. The tweets appeared to show Abd el-Fattah calling for violence against Zionists and the police.In the posts, most of which appear to have been deleted and could not immediately be verified, he described the killing of Zionists as heroic, adding “we need to kill more of them”. In 2011 he is accused of saying police “don’t have rights, we should just kill them all”. He also once described British people as dogs and monkeys.Screenshots posted online appear to show that on 8 August 2011, during the London riots, he posted: “Go burn the city or downing street or hunt police u fools.” A year later he appeared to post: “By the way I’m a racist, I don’t like white people so piss off.”What has he said since?In a lengthy statement issued in the early hours of Monday,Abd el-Fattah apologised, saying he understood “how shocking and hurtful” his past comments were.“They were mostly expressions of a young man’s anger and frustrations in a time of regional crises (the wars on Iraq, on Lebanon and Gaza), and the rise of police brutality against Egyptian youth. I particularly regret some that were written as part of online insult battles with the total disregard for how they read to other people. I should have known better,” he said.Some of the tweets had been “completely misunderstood, seemingly in bad faith” and “twisted out of their meaning”, he said.Did politicians know about the posts?A No 10 source said Keir Starmer, his deputy and the foreign secretary were unaware of Abd el-Fattah’s past comments, which the government condemned as “abhorrent”.Conservatives MPs such as the former party leader Iain Duncan Smith and Alicia Kearns, a former chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said they too were unaware of Abd el-Fattah’s posts and that they regretted lobbying for his release.Yet this isn’t the first time Abd el-Fattah’s comments on social media have provoked controversy. In 2014, his tweets cost him a nomination for the European parliament’s Sakharov prize. The group backing him withdrew the nomination for the human rights award, saying they had discovered a tweet from 2012 in which he called for the murder of Israelis. In 2015, Abd el-Fattah claimed his comments had been taken out of context.Since then successive Conservative and Labour governments had campaigned for his release from an Egyptian jail, recognising he had been unfairly detained.Who has called for Abd el-Fattah’s citizenship to be revoked?Senior Conservatives and Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, have called for Abd el-Fattah to be stripped of his British citizenship and deported. Abd el-Fattah was granted British citizenship in 2021 by Boris Johnson’s Conservative government under an immigration law that allows mothers to transmit their UK citizenship to their children, even if they are outside Britain.On Monday, Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, said the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, should look at whether Abd el-Fattah’s “citizenship can be revoked and he can be removed from Britain”.The shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that Mahmood should sign an order to revoke his citizenship “under the 1971 Immigration Act on the grounds he’s not conducive to the public good”.But Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Philp’s ideas were “not based in law”.“The Immigration Act, section six, specifically says that that doesn’t apply to Brits,” she said in response to Philp’s comments. “The law is you can’t take away people’s citizenship willy nilly in this way. You could only take away someone’s citizenship if they have dual nationality, if they’re a threat to national security. I really don’t think that Chris Philp is going to be able to tell us of an example of someone who sent a tweet 15 years ago and that being seen as a threat to national security.”Are the police involved?On Sunday, Farage said he had reported Abd el-Fattah to counter-terrorism police.A counter-terrorism policing spokesperson said on Monday: “We have received a number of public referrals in recent days relating to various historical social media posts. As with all such referrals, the posts are now in the process of being assessed by specialist officers within the counter-terrorism internet referral unit (CTIRU).“Should any potential offences be identified, then, depending on the nature of the offences, the CTIRU will either refer the matter to the relevant investigation team within counter-terrorism policing, or to the relevant local police force to consider for further investigation.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsActivismEgyptMiddle East and north AfricaHuman rightsForeign policyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

I particularly regret some that were written as part of online insult battles with the total disregard for how they read to other people. I should have known better.”In some of the tweets he describes the killing of Zionists as heroic, adding “we need to kill more of them”. He also once described British people as dogs and monkeys.“Looking back, I see the writings of a much younger person, deeply enmeshed in antagonistic online cultures, utilising flippant, shocking and sarcastic tones in the nascent, febrile world of social media. But this young man never intended to offend a wider public and was, in the real world, engaged in the non-violent pro-democracy movement and repeatedly incarcerated for calling for full equality, human rights and democracy for all.“Today, this middle-aged father firmly believes all our fates are entwined and we can only achieve prosperous and safe lives for our children together. All the initiatives I’ve led reflect this”.Abd el-Fattah admitted it was painful that the tweets had forfeited him support in the UK and asked for people to judge him by his real-life record in standing up for minorities, gay people and freedom of speech in Egypt.He claimed some of the tweets had been deliberately misconstrued.He wrote: “I must also stress that some tweets have been completely misunderstood, seemingly in bad faith. For example, a tweet being shared to allege homophobia on my part was actually ridiculing homophobia. I have paid a steep price for my public support for LGBTQ rights in Egypt and the world. Another tweet has been wrongly interpreted to suggest Holocaust denial – but in fact the exchange shows that I was clearly mocking Holocaust denial.”Abd el-Fattah also challenged claims that he was antisemitic, saying: “I take accusations of antisemitism very seriously. I have always believed that sectarianism and racism are the most sinister and dangerous of forces, and I did my part and paid the price for standing up for the rights of religious minorities in Egypt. I faced a military tribunal and imprisonment for defending Christians in Egypt falsely accused of violence.”Most of the tweets were written between 2010 and 2012 during the Arab spring, when he was turning 30.Abd el-Fattah was automatically granted British citizenship in 2021 under an immigration law that allows mothers to transmit their UK citizenship to their children, even if they are outside Britain. His mother was born in London while his grandmother was studying in the UK.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, has demanded Abd el-Fattah’s deportation, saying: “I do not want people who hate Britain coming to our country.” Nigel Farage said he had reported Abd el-Fattah to the counterterrorism police.In his statment, Abd el-Fattah said: “This weekend was supposed to be the first time I celebrated my son’s birthday with him since 2012, when he was one year old. I have been imprisoned in Egypt for almost his entire life for my consistent promotion of equality, justice and secular democracy.“That included publicly rejecting anti-Jewish speech in Egypt, often at risk to myself, defence of LGBTQ rights, defence of Egyptian Christians, and campaigning against police torture and brutality – all at great risk. And, indeed, my freedom was stripped from me for these defences of human rights. These values are core to my identity.”It is understood that Abd el-Fattah thought he had addressed the issue of his tweets after his nomination was withdrawn in 2014 for a Sakharov prize when the tweets first emerged, and he was criticised by the Wall Street Journal.He included a chapter in his book of essays setting out why he had written about armed struggle against Israel. The book had been sent to most MPs, including the prime minister and the then foreign secretary, David Lammy, but the chapter in the book did not fully address some of the most aggressive and shocking tweets, or their sheer volume.He insisted in the chapter he had made a distinction between killing Israeli civilians and combatants in a discussion about an anti-colonial struggle.Explore more on these topicsEgyptMiddle East and north AfricaHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

The pair, who later became the faces of the celebrity competition show Dancing on Ice, said the honour was “wonderful and humbling at the same time”.Dean said: “It’s been mentioned by fans and supporters, but it’s something that we never realised might happen.”Torvill said the timing of the honours seemed “perfect” after the pairdanced on the ice for the last time this year. She said: “It was a big thing for us to mark our career before retirement, and then receiving this award at the end of the year, it’s just finished everything.

Speaking to the Guardian before the honour was announced, Brown called on King Charles to apologise for what had been done to the post office operators in the name of the crown. She said: “An apology from the king would really vindicate what we have gone through.”She said much post office work was done under the name of the crown and that she and others were wrongly convicted by the crown.Mervyn Kersh, 101, a D-day veteran, said it was a “wonderful thing” to be awarded a British Empire Medal (BEM) for services to Holocaust remembrance and education.The oldest on the list was 102-year-old John Hearn, who receives a BEM for services to judo and to the community in north-east England.The youngest recipient this year was 20-year-old Toby Roberts, an Olympic gold medal-winning sports climber, who becomes an MBE.This year’s list included two sets of twins.

He made her the shadow chancellor when he was elected as Labour leader in April 2020, but replaced her with Rachel Reeves in May 2021 during a reshuffle after a crushing by-election defeat in Hartlepool.In government Dodds served as development and equalities minister, butresigned in February over plans to cut international aidto fund an increase in defence spending. She has been the MP for Oxford East since 2017.Ashworth served in the shadow cabinet for the entirety of Starmer’s time as leader of the opposition, but unexpectedly lost his seat in the July 2024 general election to the independent candidate Shockat Adam. He had represented Leicester South since 2011.After the election Ashworth took up a role heading the influential thinktank Labour Together, which is closely associated with Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, and has been credited with steering his campaign to become leader of the opposition.Thethinktank came under scrutinythis year after the Conservatives raised questions over whether the support Starmer received from Labour Together had been correctly declared. The thinktank was fined by the Electoral Commission in 2021 for failing to properly register almost £740,000 in donations, which it blamed on an administrative error.Ashworth, who was shadow health secretary during the Covid-19 pandemic, was recognised for political and parliamentary service and for his charity work on behalf of the children of alcoholics.He has spoken publicly ofhis experience growing up with an alcoholic fatherand is a patron of the National Association for Children of Alcoholics, which he says had been working over Christmas to help children living with parental alcohol abuse.Dodds said she was delighted to have received a damehood, adding: “It’s always about the team – from my MP’s staff to civil servants to party staff, and everyone who makes Oxford East such an amazing place.”Ashworth, who also served as shadow work and pensions secretary under Starmer, said he was “completely bowled over” by the award. “It was never something I expected,” he said.“I especially hope this also brings greater recognition for every child who grows up in the shadow of alcoholism. Speaking up for the thousands of children who suffer in silence is something that matters deeply to me, shaped by my own experiences growing up.”Sarah Clarke, parliament’s former Black Rod – the senior officer responsible for ceremonial protocol during events such as the state opening – has also been awarded a damehood. She wasthe first woman to become Black Rodin the 669-year history of the role, and left the post in July after more than seven years.Other political figures who received awards included Adam Ingram, who has been made a knight after serving as the Labour MP for East Kilbride from 1987 to 2010, including as Northern Ireland minister and armed forces minister under Tony Blair.Chris Ruane, the former Welsh Labour MP for the Vale of Clwyd who who helped set up a mindfulness programme in Westminster for parliamentarians and staffers in 2013, has also been made an OBE for “parliamentary and political service and to wellbeing”.Explore more on these topicsNew year honours listAnneliese DoddsJonathan AshworthnewsShareReuse this content"

Her previous Renaissance world tour brought in about more than $579m.Her husband,Jay-Z,was the first musician to become a billionaire on Forbes’s list in 2019.Rihanna,Bruce SpringsteenandTaylor Swifthave also achieved the elite status.Though Beyoncé has launched several ventures including a hair care brand, Cécred, a whiskey label called SirDavis and a clothing line calledIvy Park, most of her personal wealth comes from her music – including revenue from her catalogue and from her global tours – according to Forbes.In 2010, she founded Parkwood Entertainment, a management and production company, bringing control of all her artistic ventures – including music, concerts and documentaries – in house.Her 2024 albumCowboy Carterwas critically acclaimed, winning Beyoncé her first album of the year Grammy. The tour that followed the album’s release was the world’s highest-grossing music tour of 2025. The three-hour production included guest appearances by her husband, children and former Destiny’s Child bandmates.“Across any category of the entertainment industry, there is practically no enterprise more lucrative than a musician who can sell out stadiums,” Forbes wrote – noting that the concert tour employed 350 crew members, used 100 semi-trucks worth of equipment, and required eight 747 cargo planes to move the show from city from city.Beyoncé began her career as a member of the pop group Destiny’s Child before launching her solo career in the early 2000s. She holds the record for most-awarded and most-nominated artist in Grammy history. The artist also made an estimated $50m for the 2024 “Beyoncé Bowl” half-time show for the NFL’s Christmas game, and $10m for starring in Levi’s commercials.The artist – who sang on her track Pure/Honey, “It should cost a billion to look this good / But she make it look easy ‘cause she got it” – has now officially got it.In 2025, there are more than 3,000 billionaires around the world, according to Forbes.Explore more on these topicsUS newsBeyoncéForbes magazinenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s too bad. You would have thought he wouldn’t have done that,” Trump said, without any acknowledgment that he had first appointed Powell himself, in 2018.“But he’s an absolute fool,” the president continued, “who’s building a new Federal Reserve, or he’s doing a renovation of a building.”Turning to theNetanyahu, Trump then repeated a false claim about the cost of the renovation for the central bank headquarters he has been making for months.“Bibi, he’s up to $4.1bn to do a renovation of a few small buildings,” Trump said, inflating the cost of the renovation, which, asPowell pointed outto Trump on camera this summer, is $2.5bn.“It’s the highest price in the history of construction,” Trump went on.The president then suggested that the “magnificent, big, beautiful ballroom that the country has wanted, that the White House has wanted for 150 years”, which he is building in place of the demolished East Wing of the White House, will cost “a tiny fraction of that number”.“Gorgeous monuments are built for a much smaller price” than the Federal Reserve renovation, Trump said. “So we’re thinking about bringing a gross incompetence, what’s called a gross incompetence lawsuit, it’s gross incompetence, against Powell,” the president told reporters. “I’d love to fire him. Maybe I still might,” said TrumpOn the ballroom, Trump said, “we’re under budget and ahead of schedule.”He then immediately contradicted himself, by acknowledging that the latest cost estimate for the ballroom, $400m, is double the $200m he said it would cost a few months earlier.The increased cost, Trump said, came “after realizing that we’re gonna do the inauguration in that building”, which required “all bullet-proof glass” and a “drone-free roof, so drones won’t touch it”.Trump will appoint Powell’s successor next year. Pushed to say more about who he had in mind for the new Fed chair, Trump said he plans to announce his pick sometime in January.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveDonald TrumpUS economyJerome PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

Witnesses told police that the two helicopters they were piloting Sunday were flying close together just before they crashed in a farm field near the airport in Hammonton, about 35 miles (56km) south-east of Philadelphia.Hammonton police chief Kevin Friel said in a statement that Kirsch, of Carney’s Point, was pronounced dead at an area hospital after being flown there, while Greenberg, of Sewell, died at the crash site.“Reports were that they were flying in tandem, that they were flying close together, which is probably what caused the collision to occur,” Frieltold 6ABC.Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board were examining the accident site on Monday and determined the debris field is about 100 yards (91 meters) long and contains parts of the main rotors and tail rotors, a spokesperson said.A preliminary report is expected in about 30 days, the NTSB said.Friel said rescuers responded to a report of an aviation crash at about 11.25am on Sunday. Video from the scene shows a helicopter spinning rapidly to the ground. Police and fire crews subsequently extinguished flames that engulfed one of the helicopters.In astatement on X, Andy Kim, senator for New Jersey, said he was “heartbroken” to learn of the crash.“I know our community will rally behind the family of the individual who lost their life as we navigate this terrible tragedy,” said KimUS Senator Cory Booker described the crash as “horrifying and tragic” in a social mediastatement. “My heart is with those impacted and their families,” he said.The Federal Aviation Administration described the crash as a midair collision between an Enstrom F-28A helicopter and Enstrom 280C helicopter near Hammonton municipal airport. Only the pilots were on board.View image in fullscreenAuthorities look over the scene after two helicopters crashed in Hammonton, New Jersey, on 28 December 2025.Photograph: WPVI-TV/6ABC/APKirsch and Greenberg both received their private pilot licenses in 2014, FAA records show. They often stopped at the Apron Cafe next to the airport for breakfast before flying, said the restaurant’s owner, Sal Silipino.Silipinotold NJ.comthat the pilots were “very pleasant” regulars who had breakfast at his restaurant on Sunday morning.“They would come in every week or two if the weather was nice,” Silipino said. “They were always together … If we see one flying, the other one was always right behind them.”Silipino said Kirsch and Greenberg ate at the cafe shortly before the crash. Patrons watched the helicopters take off from the airport and were stunned when the aircraft fell from the sky, he said.“It was shocking. Still shaking to see that happen,” Silipino said. “They were just at our cafe having breakfast. They fly in together. They seem to be very nice people. They were also very kind to the workers and staff and all.”He said the helicopters’ flights appeared to begin without incident.“I saw one go down and then I saw the other one go down and there was little bit of disbelief. It’s like, is that really happening?” Silipino said.View image in fullscreenDebris from a helicopter is shown after two helicopters crashed in Hammonton, New Jersey, on 28 December 2025.Photograph: WPVI-TV/6ABC/APFAA records show Kirsch was the registered owner of one of the helicopters, while the other aircraft was registered to M&M Charter LLC of Mountville, Pennsylvania. Contact information for M&M Charter could not be immediately found Monday.Hammonton resident Dan Dameshek told NBC10 that he was leaving a gym when he heard a loud snap and saw two helicopters spinning out of control.“Immediately, the first helicopter went from right side up to upside down and started rapidly spinning, falling out of the air,” Dameshek told the TV station. “And then it looked like the second helicopter was OK for a second, and then it sounded like another snap or something … and then that helicopter started rapidly spinning out of the air.”Hammonton is a town of about 15,000 people located in Atlantic county in the southern part of New Jersey. The town has a history of agriculture and is located near the Pine Barrens, a forested wilderness area that covers more than 1m acres (405,000 hectares).Investigators will likely first look to review any communications between the two pilots and whether they were able to see each other, said Alan Diehl, a former crash investigator for the FAA and NTSB.“Virtually all midair collisions are a failure to what they call ‘see and avoid,’” Diehl said. “Clearly they’ll be looking at the out-of-cockpit views of the two aircraft and seeing if one pilot was approaching from the blind side.”Explore more on these topicsNew JerseyHelicopter crashesnewsShareReuse this content"

But then Trump took the stage to say that unlike Kirk – “a missionary with a noble spirit” who did not “hate” his opponents, Trump said he disagreed.‘We have become so divided’: Georgia district prepares for life after Marjorie Taylor GreeneRead more“I hate my opponent, and I don’t want the best for them,” Trump said.Greene said: “That was absolutely the worst statement. It just shows where his heart is. And that’s the difference, with her having a sincere Christian faith, and proves that he does not have any faith.”Greene said that her turn away from unrepentant Maga acolyte came in that moment and she abandoned her training “to never apologize and to never admit when you’re wrong”.“As a Christian, I don’t believe in doing that,” she said. “I agree with Erika Kirk, who did the hardest thing possible and said it out loud.” Greene said she later told a friend that after Kirk died, “I realized that I’m part of this toxic culture. I really started looking at my faith. I wanted to be more like Christ.”The Maga landscape post-Kirk has been showing signs of fracture, and Greene has found herself at odds with administration and Republican positions, declaring the war in Gaza a “genocide” as well as casting doubt on economic, healthcare and foreign policy positions that she says do not prioritize working-class Americans.“I was just so naive and outside of politics,” Greene said, adding: “It was easy for me to naively believe.”In a statement to the Guardian, White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said: “President Trump remains the undisputed leader of the greatest and fastest growing political movement in American history – the MAGA movement.“On the other hand, Congresswoman Greene is quitting on her constituents in the middle of her term and abandoning the consequential fight we’re in – we don’t have time for her petty bitterness,” Ingle added.Greene’s break with Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress was, she told the Times, completed over a vote to release investigative files related to the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.Greenesaid the Epstein files represented “everything wrong with Washington” and said it was a story of “rich, powerful elites doing horrible things and getting away with it. And the women are the victims”.After meeting with victims, she claimed, Trump called her and yelled “my friends will get hurt” if the files were released.In the interview, Greene said that she had been wrong to accuse Democrats of treason. She acknowledged that she is now a political outcast from both sides of the political divide.“I’m, like, radioactive,” she acknowledged.“Everyone’s like, ‘She’s changed,’” Greene added. “I haven’t changed my views. But I’ve matured. I’ve developed depth. I’ve learned Washington, and I’ve come to understand the brokenness of the place.”Explore more on these topicsMarjorie Taylor GreeneDonald TrumpRepublicansUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s too bad. You would have thought he wouldn’t have done that,” Trump said, without any acknowledgment that he had first appointed Powell himself, in 2018.“But he’s an absolute fool,” the president continued, “who’s building a new Federal Reserve, or he’s doing a renovation of a building.”Turning to theNetanyahu, Trump then repeated a false claim about the cost of the renovation for the central bank headquarters he has been making for months.“Bibi, he’s up to $4.1bn to do a renovation of a few small buildings,” Trump said, inflating the cost of the renovation, which, asPowell pointed outto Trump on camera this summer, is $2.5bn.“It’s the highest price in the history of construction,” Trump went on.The president then suggested that the “magnificent, big, beautiful ballroom that the country has wanted, that the White House has wanted for 150 years”, which he is building in place of the demolished East Wing of the White House, will cost “a tiny fraction of that number”.“Gorgeous monuments are built for a much smaller price” than the Federal Reserve renovation, Trump said. “So we’re thinking about bringing a gross incompetence, what’s called a gross incompetence lawsuit, it’s gross incompetence, against Powell,” the president told reporters. “I’d love to fire him. Maybe I still might,” said TrumpOn the ballroom, Trump said, “we’re under budget and ahead of schedule.”He then immediately contradicted himself, by acknowledging that the latest cost estimate for the ballroom, $400m, is double the $200m he said it would cost a few months earlier.The increased cost, Trump said, came “after realizing that we’re gonna do the inauguration in that building”, which required “all bullet-proof glass” and a “drone-free roof, so drones won’t touch it”.Trump will appoint Powell’s successor next year. Pushed to say more about who he had in mind for the new Fed chair, Trump said he plans to announce his pick sometime in January.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveDonald TrumpUS economyJerome PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

And last week, the US postedfar strongerthan expected economic growth figures for the summer months.But the pessimism underscores an economically tumultuous year. Americans have reported feeling shaken by Trump’s tariffs, mass government layoffs and a crackdown on immigration. The Conference Board’s measure ofconsumer confidencehas dropped for five consecutive months.Caviar bumps, cost jumps: US consumers on how they’re dining in Trump’s economyRead moreThe White House has insisted that it’s “bringing our economy back from the brink of ruin”, as Trump said in a mid-Decemberspeech. “Now, under our leadership, [prices] are all coming down – and they’re coming down fast,” the president said.The new Harris poll underscores the sharp differences between political party, gender, race and income that shape how people see the current state of the economy. Republicans scored Joe Biden’s handling of the economy far more harshly than Democrats during his term.The stark divisions between Democrats and Republicans continue to persist. Democrats are almost twice as likely as Republicans to say their financial security is getting worse – 52% versus 27%.A chart showing that democrats and independents are more likely to believe that the US is experiencing a recessionBut more concerningly for Republicans, who will have to fight next year to keep their majority in Congress, Trump hasn’t been able to sway independents. A majority (54%) of independents said their financials are worsening, +9% compared with February’s polling. Most independents (58%) also believe the country is experiencing a recession.And more of the blame is being placed on the White House than ever before. When asked to choose between the government or corporations for the question “who is most responsible for any increasing prices”:76% of Democrats said it was government management of the economy, +17% from February’s poll.72% of independents also pointed to the government, +14% from February.Republicans were less likely to point to the government, with 55% saying it was government (-6% compared to February) and 45% blaming corporate practices.A chart showing that republicans are less likely to believe that the government is the most responsible for increasing prices of goods and servicesAnalysis after the 2024 election showed Trump gain withwomenandHispanicvoters. But in another worrying sign for Republicans, over the course of his first year, these voters have soured on the economy.While Americans overall have grown more pessimistic this year, women are far less confident about the economy than men. Nearly two-thirds of women (62%) believe the US is experiencing a recession, +12% from February, compared with 52% of men who believe the same. And half of women (50%) believe their financial security is getting worse while 39% of men believe the same.Stark racial gaps are seen for beliefs on the overall state of the US economy. Two-thirds of Black and Hispanic voters (66% and 67%, respectively) think the US is in a recession, compared with 52% of white voters. The jump for Hispanic voters was +11% from February, the highest jump among any race.The poll also highlighted what some economists have referred to as theK-shaped economy– the divide in economic sentiment between wealthy Americans, who are the largest beneficiaries of a booming stock market, and everyone else. Of those who are making less than $50,000 a year, 59% said their financial security is getting worse, +13% compared to February’s poll. In comparison, 37% of those making over $100,000 said things are getting worse.This survey was conducted online within the US by The Harris Poll from 11 to 13 December2025, among a nationally representative sample of 2,180 US adults.Explore more on these topicsUS economyDonald TrumpEconomicsTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Some previous executives in the post have lasted only for short periods.The opening comes against a backbeat of warnings from inside the AI industry about the risks of the increasingly capable technology. On Monday, Mustafa Suleyman, the chief executive of Microsoft AI, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I honestly think that if you’re not a little bit afraid at this moment, then you’re not paying attention.”Demis Hassabis, the Nobel prize-winning co-founder of Google DeepMind, this monthwarned of risksthat included AIs going “off the rails in some way that harms humanity”.Amid resistance from Donald Trump’s White House, there is little regulation of AI at national or international level. Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist known as one of the “godfathers of AI”, said recently: “A sandwich has more regulation than AI.” The result is that AI companies are largely regulating themselves.Altman said on X as he launched the job search: “We have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities, but we are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides both in our products and in the world, in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits. These questions are hard and there is little precedent.”One user responded sardonically: “Sounds pretty chill, is there vacation included?”What is included is an unspecified slice of equity in OpenAI, a company that has been valued at $500bn.Last month, the rival company Anthropicreportedthe first AI-enabled cyber-attacks in which artificial intelligence acted largely autonomously under the supervision of suspected Chinese state actors to successfully hack and access targets’ internal data. This month, OpenAIsaidits latest model was almost three times better at hacking than three months earlier and said “we expect that upcoming AI models will continue on this trajectory”.OpenAI is also defending a lawsuit from the family of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old from California who killed himself after alleged encouragement from ChatGPT. It hasarguedRaine misused the technology. Another case, filed this month, claims ChatGPT encouraged the paranoid delusions of a 56-year-old in Connecticut, Stein-Erik Soelberg, who then murdered his 83-year old mother and killed himself.An OpenAI spokesperson said it was reviewing the filings in the Soelberg case, which it described as “incredibly heartbreaking” and that it was improving ChatGPT’s training “to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAISam AltmanComputingCybercrimeHackingInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Whether it’s strategy or dysfunction, the result looks the sameMelissa JacobsMon 29 Dec 2025 10.50 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 11.02 ESTShareTheLas Vegas Raidersmade waves this week by putting its two, and only, stars on injured reserve ahead of the final two games that will decide the 2026 NFL draft order. Tight end Brock Bowers and edge rusher Maxx Crosby were shut down from a consequential battle for the top draft pick against the Giants and a Week 18 game against Kansas City due to nagging knee injuries. Bowers had scored four touchdowns over the past five weeks for a team that doesn’t score many points. Crosby is a human wrecking ball who has amassed 28 tackles for loss this season. He’s the player that causes opponents to lose sleep. Both Bowers and Crosby were recently named to the Pro Bowl despite their nagging injuries. Bowers stepped away quietly. Crosby did not.A fuming Crosby left the Raiders facility Friday. The next day hesent a message to the organizationby posting videos of himself playing basketball with his young daughter. He did not appear particularly injured.Earlier in the week, when reporters asked Crosby about the stakes of the upcoming battle between the 2-14 Raiders and 2-14 Giants, his response was no surprise.“I don’t give a fuck about the pick, I don’t play for that,” Crosby said. “That’s not my job. My job is to be the best defensive end in the world, and that’s what I focus on every day. And being a great leader and being an influence and being that guy on a consistent basis for my team.”Crosby didn’t care that the game was a joke among the football zeitgeist, some dubbing it The Toilet Bowl or The Tank Bowl. He just wanted to do Maxx Crosby things.There is no official way to confirm whether the Raiders are trying to tank. Crosby’s saga doesn’t help the organization’s case. Though it’s not like Crosby is the only competitor. A 74-year-old Pete Carroll isn’t there to secure the Raiders future. These are professional football players. Maybe Crosby wants it the most, but they want it too. Even journeyman Geno Smith seemingly wants to win.All the Raiders won in an embarrassing 34-10 loss to the Giants is pole position in theNFLDraft. For many, that’s a thrilling win. But walking into Allegiant Stadium with no Crosby and Bowers and exiting with the top pick in the draft only fueled the tank conspiracy theorists.The offensive line was terrible. Special teams was terrible, and seemingly asleep on a Giants 95-yard kickoff return that pretty much sealed the game for New York. Geno Smith was terrible, tossing two interceptions. The defense was terrible, or depending on full your glass is, the Giants’ play calling was effective and executed by potential franchise quarterback Jaxson Dart.The Raiders and Giants did not look like teams with the same record who were playing with the same intensity. Simply put, the Raiders were outcoached and outplayed.Perhaps having Crosby would have helped a bit. A defensive leader who plays with a unique level of heart is certainly a great add.But the problem with the Raiders and the whole tank theory is the team and organization is atrocious. Even with Crosby and Bowers, this is a team that has won two games. Two. They are currently on a 10-game losing streak. You can’t win a football game with one elite player on both side of the ball. What about the other ten players? In true Raiders fashion, the only other offense player contending for elite status plays the same position as Bowers, Michael Mayer.There is just so little to be excited about in this iteration of the Raiders. Carroll’s coaching has been uninspired. Knowing he has a backup to Ben Johnson, who minority owner Tom Brady failed to secure, is even more frustrating. Firing Chip Kelly did nothing to spark the offense. Despite his talent and obvious upside, drafting Ashton Jeanty in the first round when the rest of your roster is so devoid of talent has only added to the pile of problems.And now, the Raiders have stoked the beast that is Crosby. Quality organizations handle these discussions privately and somehow, some way present a united front with their star player.Because the inept Raiders failed to do so, no one would be surprised if Crosby demands a trade in the offseason. Then edge rusher would be yet another hole this team needs.Tank or terrible? Does it really matter?MVP of the weekYeah, the Pats were facing the hapless Jets. Yeah, the Jets defense is historically bad (still zero picks on the season). But the Jets are still technically a professional football team playing at home, and the Pats had some business to attend to. Clinch the AFC East with a win and Bills loss. Stay in contention for the AFC’s No 1 seed. Check and check, thanks to an out-of-this-world day by Drake Maye.Maye led the Pats offensive onslaught, throwing for 256 yards and five touchdowns to five different receivers, while completing, get this, 90% of his passes. One of those completed passes was amasterclass in mossingby Stefon Diggs, who also had a sensational day and helped Maye set an NFL record. He became the first player in NFL history to top 250 yards and a 90% completion rate while throwing five touchdowns. Maye also surpassed 4,000 passing yards on the season and remained undefeated on the road. Beautiful deep balls, veins of ice, shrewd decision making, only 23-years-old. Perhaps this is just the beginning of another Patriots dynasty. But for now, can you hear those M-V-P chants?Video(s) of the week“My biggest concern is the health and safety of the players”- Sean McDermott on wanting the Tush Push bannedpic.twitter.com/N2WdXkeTgH— Eagles Fan Central (@PhilaFanCentral)December 29, 2025BILLS GO FOR TWO! EAGLES SAY NO!pic.twitter.com/SA2z2TzA0D— NFL (@NFL)December 29, 2025Buffalo were on the brink of losing, until they were on the brink of winning (or at least tying).The Eagles did their usual Jekyll and Hyde act, roaring out to a 13-0 lead in the first half before lying dormant in the second. Philly’s defense dominated early, forcing a first-half fumble that resulted in a Jalen Hurts touchdown pass. They also stopped Josh Allen on a fourth-and-goal attempt early in the second. But the Bills crept back in the second and in the game’ final drive pulled within one after a Josh Allen tush push. Yes, the same tush push the Bills voted to ban last offseason. Despite the Bills owning momentum on both sides of the ball – Jalen Hurts had not completed a second-half pass - Sean McDermott decided to go for two. Vic Fangio’s defense brought the pressure, forcing Allen into an errant throw and incompletion. a 13-12 Eagles win, handing the Patriots the AFC East.Stat of the weekThe Steelers remain winless in Cleveland since 2003 with quarterbacks not named Ben Roethlisberger.Add Aaron Rodgers to the list. The Browns got off to a fast start 10-0 thanks to a chucked up Shedeur Sanders pass caught by Harold Fannin that the safety oddly didn’t attempt to track. Rodgers, under pressure all day, struggled to generate much offense in a 13-6 loss that could have clinched the AFC North for the Steelers.The Steelers had plenty of chances in the fourth quarter but failed to score on five straight drives (including a missed field goal after an 8:07 drive). Rodgers was clearly missing the suspended DK Metcalf. On the Steelers final drive, Marquez Valdes-Scantling could not haul in three straight throws in the end zone on 2nd and goal from the 7-yard line.Sanders was sensational at times, again proving that somenepo babies belong, though he needs to work on eliminating the desperation heaves. Myles Garrett did not break the sack record, though according to NextGen States chipped in on 41% of pass rush attempts.Pittsburgh’s loss means renewed hope for the Baltimore Ravens who destroyed the Packers 41-24 thanks to Derrick Henry’s 216-yard, four-touchdown onslaught.The NFL gets its wish: a Ravens-Steelers Week 18 battle for the division.Elsewhere around the leagueCarolina v Seattle was a classic defensive struggle, at least for a half. The teams went into the break tied 3-3 before the Seahawks blew the game open by capitalising on two straight Panthers turnovers. Seattle’s punishing defense, led by Demarcus Lawrence – who forced and recovered a key fumble – smothered Carolina, which failed to produce a single play longer than 11 yards all afternoon.The result was a decisive 24-10 road win that keeps Seattle atop the NFC race for the No 1 seed. The Seahawks travel to San Francisco next week, where the winner takes the top seed. The Panthers, meanwhile, head to Tampa Bay in Week 18 with the NFC South title on the line. Win and they are in the postseason. Lose and the season is over.The Houston Texans continue to look like the team nobody wants to face in January. After starting 0-3, Houston have now won eight straight and clinched a playoff spot with a gritty 20-16 road victory over the Chargers. The league’s top-rated defense once again set the tone, pressuring Justin Herbert on 38% of his dropbacks and recording five sacks.CJ Stroud and the offense began fast with two deep touchdown strikes before slipping back into inconsistency, but three crucial first downs on the final possession – aided by a defensive penalty – sealed the win. As has so often been the case during this streak, the game ball belonged to the defense.It wasanother locker-room celebration in Jacksonvilleafter the Jaguars edged the Colts 23-17 in an ugly but compelling contest. The Jags leaned on toughness and Trevor Lawrence’s legs in the red zone to grind out the result, winning their 12th game of the season – a mark they had not reached in 20 years. One more victory will secure the AFC South title, and on current form, Jacksonville look like another playoff opponent best avoided.Elsewhere, it appears the cheese-grater hat is no longer the exclusive property of the Chicago Bears. A week after DJ Moore donned one to celebrate a win over Green Bay, several Ravens players followed suit after trolling the Packers in the wake of their own dominant victory. It has been a memorable holiday season for Foam Party Hats, the unlikely beneficiaries of NFL pettiness.Finally, Charles Barkley may have had a point when hecalled the NFL “greedy”for encroaching on Christmas Day. This year’s three-game slate – locked in by Thursday Night Football and immune from flexing – delivered a grim combination of third-string quarterbacks, teams playing their second game in a month-long holiday slog, and football that was often poor and largely meaningless. The schedule-makers may have hoped matchups like Denver v Kansas City or Dallas v Washington would sparkle, but the league’s unpredictability cuts both ways. If Christmas football cannot be made flexible, the NFL might consider handing the day back to the NBA.Explore more on these topicsLas Vegas RaidersNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

At some point it must stop – but not yetJonathan WilsonMon 29 Dec 2025 16.52 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 18.17 ESTShareIt can’t go on. It makes no sense that it goes on. And yet it goes on.Aston Villa went into Saturday’s Premier Leage game at Chelsea having won 10 games in a row, looking to match a record set in 1897 and 1914. For an hour there seemed no chance they would achieve it, as Chelsea outplayed them, took the lead and could have had several more. But Chelsea are vulnerable with a lead, especially at home, and Villa have developed a baffling habit of winning away games having gone behind.First Ollie Watkins equalised, the ball cannoning in off his shin and the post after he’d been set clean through and his initial effort blocked by Robert Sánchez. Then he got the winner with a deft header, just the fourth and fifth league goals he’s scored this season. Watkins perhaps would feel he is due some luck, but there is no doubting the first goal was fortunate. At the moment, though, luck is favouring Villa.The last nine of those 11 wins in a row have been by a single goal. They’ve kept a clean sheet in only one of them. They’ve had the better xG in only six of those games and in two of those their xG was better by 0.2 or less. Their last five away Premier League games have been won after going behind. This shouldn’t be sustainable, but everybody’s been saying that for weeks and Villa keep on winning. The question is whether results will decline to match performances or whether performances could rise to match results.Coming from behind is not just a trait of this season. Over the past three seasons no side has won more points from losing positions than Villa’s 54; 18 of those have come this season, 50% more than the team second in that list, Sunderland. This season, Villa substitutes have scored nine goals. Two things can perhaps be said of Villa under Unai Emery. Firstly, that they have a self-belief that means there is never a sense that a game is beyond them. That is, to an extent, self-perpetuating: the more they come from behind, the more they believe they can come from behind.And secondly, that Emery is very adept at changing games from the bench. While Chelsea had the better of the xG 2.1-1.4, Villa were dominant from the moment just before the hour when Emery made a triple change. Watkins came on for Donyell Malen who, with limited service, had struggled to impose himself. Suddenly the ball was sticking, while Watkins’s movement behind the defensive line cause problems. Amadou Onana came on for Emi Buendía and Jadon Sancho came on for John McGinn. That both strengthened Villa’s centre by advancing Youri Tielemans, which in turn released Morgan Rogers, and gave them the width they had eschewed early on.Chelsea had 10 shots to none before that change; Villa had 11 chances to four afterwards. By the end, Villa were in control and could easily have won more comfortably. Not for the first time this season, Enzo Maresca was unable to react as a game started to slide away from him; the impression remains that he is better at putting together a tactical plan when he has time to prepare than when reacting on the hoof.Villa have also developed a happy habit of having players suddenly do something sensational to turn games. Rogers scored twice at Leeds and at West Ham and also got two at home against Manchester United. The sight of him working the ball onto his right foot and whipping a finish into the top corner has become a leitmotif for the season. It was Malen operating from the flank who turned the game after coming on at half-time at Leeds. Watkins changed the game at Stamford Bridge. The contribution of Ezri Konsa and Victor Lindelöf on Saturday, particularly in the first half, should not be overlooked. At the moment, it’s never the whole tea playing brilliantly, but sufficient individuals within it to get them the wins.Can they keep going? They’re three points behind Arsenal and, on that logic, as the season approaches its halfway point they have to be considered part of the race, certainly more than the club world champions Chelsea or the defending champions Liverpool. Tuesday’s away game at Arsenal will be a major test of that. Villa beat Arsenal on the first weekend of December, a game in which Villa didn’t only have the better xG but registered an xG 40% higher than any other side had achieved against Arsenal in the league this season.Arsenal have put together their own run of single-goal victories since, winning three in a row without ever being entirely convincing. Tuesday will be a test of both sides – and if Villa win a 12th game in a row, it would become almost impossible to deny their title credentials.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Fox, 55, was part of a group of more than a dozen swimmers who left from Lovers Point near Monterey, California, on 21 December, but she never returned to shore. A witness driving by the area reported to authorities that they saw a shark with what appeared to be a human body in its mouth emerge from the water,according to the San Francisco Chronicle.The disappearance and reports of the shark drew widespread public attention and efforts from authorities to locate Fox. On Sunday, Fox’s husband, Jean-François Vanreusel, and other members of her swim club held a memorialwalk along the Lovers Point coastline. Fox’s father, who confirmedthe death to NBC Bay Area, described his daughter as an empathetic and kind person who loved to swim, and who had taken part in numerous triathlons including the annualEscape From Alcatrazchallenge.Authorities last week launched a large-scale search and rescue operation involving multiple US Coast Guard boat crews along with responders from local fire and police departments to look for Fox. The Coast Guardsuspended its searchlast Monday for Fox after a 15-hour operation covering about 84 nautical miles.California firefighters announced on Saturday that they had recovered a body on Davenport beach, just south of Santa Cruz. The Santa Cruz county sheriff’s office issued a statement the same day, citing an ongoing investigation into the death.“Today, at approximately 2:00 pm, a body was recovered from the ocean south of Davenport Beach. Due to the close proximity to the recent shark attack victim in Monterey County, our agency is working closely with the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office and the Pacific Grove Police Department regarding the recovery,” the Santa Cruz county sheriff’s office said.Editor and fellow swimmer Sara Rubin,writing inMonterey County Weekly, described Fox as a friend and passionate athlete who found peace in the Pacific Ocean.“Twenty years ago, Erica Fox and a friend started swimming every Sunday at Lovers Point in Pacific Grove. Since then, multiple books have been written about the science of swimming and what it does for our brains. But Erica never needed a book to tell her what she knew through experience: Swimming in the ocean is a balm for body and mind, an adventure as much as a meditation.” Rubin wrote. “She developed a deeply intimate relationship with the Pacific Ocean not by studying it or by looking at it, but by getting into it—again and again and again, on choppy days and gloriously calm days, logging what I can only guess are thousands of miles.”Rubin said that Fox “understood the risk” of swimming in an ocean with a population of great white sharks, and would “object to framing this as an attack, and she would urge us to instead call it an incident—an animal’s behavior is just that”.Although many species of sharks live off the California coast, violent incidents with humans are extremely rare. Prior to Fox’s death, there have been16 shark-related fatalitiesin California in the past 75 years.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaSharksTriathlonWest CoastMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

Leicester are four points off the playoff zone going into Thursday’s visit to Sheffield United but there are still plans for fans to boycott next Monday’s televised game with West Brom.Cifuentes praised the fans’ vocal encouragement on the night – “That’s the kind of atmosphere I love,” he said. “The fans were very helpful for us and I’m pleased for them” – but it is fragile.Coventry 0-2 Ipswich, Middlesbrough 0-1 Hull and more: Football League – liveRead moreIt took until the 15th minute for the home fans to start chanting “sack the board” and calling for the technical director, Jon Rudkin, to go, by which stage both teams had scored. There were also banners, one demanding “King Power out”. By the time James gave Leicester the lead four minutes before the interval, the home crowd barely knew whether to cheer or jeer.Scrooge would have struggled to make a worse job of managing staff morale at Christmas than Leicester. Non-player wages were due to be paid on 19 December before an email from the interim managing director, Kamonthip Netthanomsak, “regrettably” informed staff they were being deferred until New Year’s Eve. The atmosphere at the Christmas party was said to be foul. The chair, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, has not missed at least three recent home games so his pleas for club and fans to come together have not gone down well.They have shown they can win big games – such as against Ipswich, and at Pride Park three weeks ago – but then lose twice to drop back into mid-table. So it is not surprising home supporters’ spirits oscillate more than a chocolate-giddy child halfway through the Christmas holidays.They were up when De Cordova-Reid sidefooted home in the sixth minute, after the bright spark Abdul Fatawu beat Callum Elder to cross from the right wing; and down again when Brewster converted Elder’s cross from the left after good work from Patrick Agyemang.View image in fullscreenRhian Brewster scored his first goal since August to equalise for Derby.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PALeicester still have a sprinkling of Premier League quality, demonstrated when Stephy Madividi invited Oliver Skipp to punch in a first-time pass for Luke Thomas to control, spin and volley wide. But Cifuentes, who succeeded Ruud van Nistelrooy in the summer, claims to still be working through inherited problems, and that is before a potential points deduction kicks in for spending breaches from two years ago.Quick GuideChampionship roundupShowYang Min-hyeok scored a last-gasp winner to givePortsmoutha vital 2-1 win overCharltonand lift them out of the relegation zone. Harvey Knibbs headed in an equaliser in the last minute of additional time after Conor Shaughnessy had given Pompey the lead. But Portsmouth went straight up the other end and caused euphoria right around the ground as Tottenham loanee Yang struck a devastating blow to Nathan Jones' side.Sheffield Unitedmoved seven points clear of the relegation zone after claiming a 2-1 win away atStoke. Second-half goals from Jairo Riedewald and Tom Cannon secured all three points for Chris Wilder's side. Ben Wilmot halved the deficit with 25 minutes remaining but Stoke, who lost Ben Pearson to an 88th-minute red card, were unable to find an equaliser and  have now failed to register a win in six out of their last seven matches.A 90th-minute winner from the substitute Vivaldo Semedo earned in-formWatforda hard-fought 1-0 victory overNorwichat Carrow Road whileSheffield Wednesday's winless run stretched to 17 games with a goalless draw atBlackburn.Wrexhammoved to within four points of the playoff places with a 2-1 win overPreston. Nathan Broadhead (pictured) nodded them in front in the 28th minute before the substitute Ollie Rathbone doubled their lead 12 minutes from time, with Alfie Devine's late consolation not enough to stop Phil Parkinson's men making it back-to-back wins in the league for the first time this season.Macaulay Langstaff's first goal since the opening day of the season gaveMillwalla 2-1 victory overBristol Citythat moved them back into the   playoff positions.

They are doughty under John Eustace, and look far more resilient than when fighting relegation this time last year. They had won five successive games before losing the 10-goal Carlton Morris to an ankle injury that has ruled him out until February.They are missing him, even if Brewster, Agyemang, Lars-Jørgen Salvesen and Ben Brereton-Díaz offer plenty of contrasting attacking potential. Eustace said: “In that final third we need to show a bit more quality and belief, to want to put our head in where it hurts. We put plenty of good crosses in but we need to get on the end of them. It’s frustrating because we felt we could come here and win. But you can’t fault their effort.”Hamza Choudhury and Aaron Ramsey – who went off with a recurrence of a hamstring injury four minutes after coming on as a substitute – joined the list of midfield players ruled out for Leicester. Already missing is Boubakary Soumaré, with Harry Winks seemingly on his way out of the club. But they finished the game in control, with Zetterström, the Derby goalkeeper, spectacularly tipping over a headed intervention from Ebou Adams, his own captain.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipLeicester CityDerby Countymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Monday’s defeat ended a run of eight straight home wins for Coventry, who were handed their first loss at the CBS Arena this season – and only a third in the league this calendar year.Ipswich dominated the first half, enjoying almost 70% possession against an uncharacteristically passive Coventry. McKenna made four changes to his side from the 0-0 draw with Millwall on Boxing Day as Jack Taylor, Sindre Walle Egeli and Clarke replaced Jens Cajuste, Kasey McAteer and Jaden Philogene.Jacob Greaves replaced the ill Leif Davis at left-back, and it was his cross that created the first opening of the match when Iván Azón’s header was saved by Carl Rushworth.Quick GuideLeague One roundupShowYousef Salech's 11th league goal of the season ensuredCardiffmaintained their three-point lead at the top of League One as they completed the double overStevenagewith a 2-1 win in the Welsh capital.

The 24-year-old sprawled to his right to keep out the midfielder’s well-struck effort, tipping on to the underside of the bar before Luke Woolfenden prodded the ball out for a corner.View image in fullscreenKieran McKenna, the Ipswich manager, applauds the fans after their win at Coventry.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAThe Sky Blues, who had managed just one effort in the first half through Ephron Mason-Clark’s header, started the second half on the front foot as Victor Torp’s shot was blocked by Greaves. Ipswich’s goalkeeper, Christian Walton, made his first save 10 minutes after the break when he pushed away Haji Wright’s deflected effort as the American went in search of his first goal since 4 October. Lampard was then left aghast when the referee Anthony Backhouse waved away appeals for a penalty after Wright and Furlong clashed on the edge of the box.Rushworth had enjoyed a quiet start to the second period after his first-half heroics but was called upon once again as he pushed Azón’s goalbound shot out for a corner.

McKenna said of Burns’ goal: “Delighted for Wes, for his family, delighted for the staff, medical team who worked really hard with him, really nice for the supporters and for his teammates.”Lampard conceded that his side “didn’t play as well as we normally do and we came up against a good team, a strong team in this league.

Both those advance to the last 16 as Angola, on two points, finish in third and face an anxious wait to see if that is enough as one of the four best third-placed sides.South Africa led three times thanks to a first international goal from Tshepang Moremi, as well as strikes from Lyle Foster and Appollis, but the coach, Hugo Broos, will be concerned by how open his side were at times at the back.Tawanda Maswanhise scored an excellent first equaliser for Zimbabwe and they also profited from an Aubrey Modiba own goal, but missed several other chances and should have earned at least a draw.South Africa led after seven minutes as Moremi’s shot took a wicked deflection off Divine Lunga and looped into the net. Zimbabwe hit back in the 19th minute with a goal that will go down as one of the best of the tournament as Maswanhise picked up the ball 35 yards out and danced past two defenders before drilling a low shot past Ronwen Williams.But South Africa were back in front five minutes after the break when Lunga’s back header to his goalkeeper, Washington Arubi, allowed Foster to sneak in ahead and nod the ball into the net. Zimbabwe equalised again in the 73rd minute as Maswanhise’s low shot was saved by Williams, but the ball deflected on to Modiba and into the net for an own goal.South Africa were awarded a penalty with 10 minutes remaining when the midfielder Marvelous Nakamba made a goalkeeper-style diving save and handled a shot that appeared to be going wide. Appollis converted from the spot and Zimbabwe’s hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages at the sixth attempt were dashed.Egyptrested all their key players but still kept up their unbeaten run, drawing 0-0 withAngola. Egypt had already confirmed top spot in the group before kick-off, allowing them the luxury of making 11 changes from their 1-0 win against South Africa on Friday, and giving players such as Mohamed Salah and Omar Marmoush the day off.Angola finished third in the group but their two-point haul means they have an anxious wait and will only advance if Tanzania and Uganda are beaten in their final Group C matches on Tuesday.Angola had the better of the chances to win the game with Chico Banza’s 42nd-minute effort coming closest. He played a quick one-two with his fellow forward Mabululu and held off two defenders but put his effort past the post.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Africa Cup of NationsSouth Africa football teamZimbabwe football teamEgypt football teamAngola football teamMorocco football teamnewsShareReuse this content"

To have two England teams – in two of our most loved sports – win major tournaments in the space of a few months was just extraordinary.”Wiegman, who has overseen England’s run to three consecutive major finals, said: “I would like to express my sincere gratitude for this honour. When I first arrived in England, I could never have imagined the respect and warmth I’ve experienced from the English people.” As a Dutchwoman, Wiegman is ineligible for the title of dame, hence the honorary nature of her award.Debbie Hewiit, the Football Association’s chair, said Wiegman has “captured the hearts of the English public”, adding: “We feel incredibly privileged to have not only the world’s leading head coach, but also an exceptional leader – someone who leads with integrity, humility, and a deep belief in human connection.”The broadcaster Gabby Logan and the former world and European marathon champion Paula Radcliffe, both already MBEs, were made OBEs, as was the commentator Clive Tyldesley, for services to broadcasting and charity.View image in fullscreenJayne Torvill and Christopher Dean have been recognised in the new year honours list.Photograph: PAThere is also recognition for the off-pitch efforts that contributed to England hosting a successful Rugby World Cup. Sarah Massey, the tournament’s managing director, is made an MBE, and the chair of the board of directors, Gill Whitehead, an OBE.Aldcroft, who lifted the trophy after September’s win over Canada, said: “As Red Roses, our aim is always to inspire. We hope we will continue to do so in 2026 and make people all over the country incredibly proud.”Perhaps surprisingly, the Lionesses trio of Chloe Kelly, Hannah Hampton and Michelle Agyemang have all been omitted from this year’s list despite widespread acclaim for their performances last summer, along with Alessia Russo, who scored England’s goal in the final against Spain.Lucy Bronze reveals she played with fractured tibia throughout Euro 2025Read moreDr Ritan Mehta, the Lionesses’ head of medical, is made an MBE for services to football, having worked with the team for 11 years, while that honour also goes to the former England player Kerry Davis for services to football and diversity in sport. In 1982, she became England’s first black female international player. She scored 44 times for England and Wiegman added: “I’d also like to congratulate Kerry – she is a Lionesses’ legend and the women’s game would not be where it is today without her, and the contribution of so many former players. We have a lot to thank her for.”Stanway, who helped Bayern Munich win two major trophies in 2025 as well as being a key player for the Lionesses in Switzerland, said of her honour: “Receiving an MBE is a real ‘pinch me’ moment. After all, I am just a girl from Barrow. I love my country and I’ll fly the flag wherever life takes me. To be awarded an MBE is such a huge honour so thank you and dream big!”The former executive chair of Tottenham Daniel Levy and the former Celtic chief executive Fergus McCann have been made CBEs. The former Celtic defender Jim Craig, who was part of their 1967 Lisbon Lions who won the European Cup, is an OBE while the tennis umpire James Keothavong becomes an MBE along with the broadcaster and former England cricketer Isa Guha.Explore more on these topicsSportWomen's footballWomen's rugby unionRugby unionNew year honours listSarina WiegmanLeah WilliamsonnewsShareReuse this content"

Amorim was asked if the 31-year-old is still an influence on the team and offered a humorous response regarding his own role.“He’s the guy that is watching training even after treatment. He’s going there,” the Portuguese said of his compatriot. “I don’t know if he wants my job or not, but he’s a leader. He cannot be that guy that when he is not playing, he’s not talking and speaking. He’s always speaking. That’s why he’s the captain. He has bad things sometimes, the way he moves his arms [gestures, on-field], but has a lot of good things too. So there are a lot of things that you don’t see but that he does. He’s a great leader all the time.”Kobbie Mainoo is ‘the future of Manchester United’, insists AmorimRead moreFernandes is already pushing to start working again. “Bruno was already saying that he needs to train, but we don’t know,” Amorim said. “No chance he is going to play against Wolves, no chance.”While United host Wolves in Tuesday’s 8.15pm kick-off, Amorim is unsure whether Mason Mount will be available after he was removed at half-time of Boxing Day’s1-0 win over Newcastleat Old Trafford.“I don’t know how Mase is going to be for that game,” said Amorim. “Kobbie Mainoo is also not going to be ready, Bruno, Matt [De Ligt] and Harry [Maguire] are not going to be ready. So I think we are not going to have more players.”If Mount is ruled out this will mean eight players are unavailable as Noussair Mazraoui, Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo are at the Africa Cup of Nations. Amorim was asked if any of the injured might recover for United’s trip to Leeds on Sunday.“Kobbie Mainoo is going to start training on the pitch also, so we will see. Matthijs is struggling a little bit. Harry’s the same, so I don’t know,” he said.United’s win over Newcastle took them to 29 points and a season-high fifth before Liverpool’s win over Wolves on Saturday dropped them back to sixth. Yet though Wolves have only two points Amorim pointed to their2-1 loss at Arsenalon 13 December, which came only after Yerson Mosquera’s 94th-minute own-goal.He said: “They show against Arsenal, they could get at least one point. So in the Premier League you never know. They have their problems, we have our problems but there are no excuses. We need to win, we will try to win the game.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

Pio Esposito had barely entered as a second-half substitute when he was gifted possession by an opponent, Berat Djimsiti. Instead of taking the chance on himself, he froze the last defender and released Lautaro to score with a side-footed through-ball.Serie A roundup: Lautaro Martínez puts Inter back on top with winner at AtalantaRead moreThis has been an up-and-down season so far for Inter, still working out who they want to be six months into Cristian Chivu’s tenure as manager. They have lost four league games – including matches against title rivals Juventus, Milan and Napoli – and were knocked out of the SuperCoppa before the final by Bologna.Yet Sunday’s win still means they end 2025 on top of Serie A, despite having played one fewer game than half of the division. Milan are only a point behind, and Napoli two, with Juventus (four) and Roma (six) still also very much in the hunt. But if this might –as Suzy Campanale predicted last week– be a season in which the champions wind up crawling across the finish line, then Inter are for now the ones wiggling fastest.And perhaps Pio Esposito has told us why. At a time when goals are especially hard to come by in Serie A, Inter own the player most adept at getting them. Lautaro’s winner againstAtalantawas nothing spectacular, but the Argentinian still took his chance efficiently: teeing himself up with his right boot then finishing calmly with his left beyond one of the league’s better goalkeepers.If anybody needed reminding that such finishes are never as straightforward as the best make them look, then Lazar Samardzic offered a demonstration soon afterward. Presented with a golden opportunity to equalise for Atalanta in the 87th minute, the Serbian jabbed wide from an unmarked position in the middle of Inter’s six-yard box.View image in fullscreenLautaro Martínez (right) celebrates his 15th goal of 2025 to end the year joint top of the scoring charts.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockLautaro has been on a roll lately, finding the net in four consecutive league games. He is Serie A’s top scorer so far this season, and Sunday’s strike put him level with Riccardo Orsolini in first place for this calendar year, too, on 15 goals apiece. Though the Bologna player’s tally is more impressive – he plays as a winger, not a centre-forward – it does include four penalties, where Lautaro has not taken any.We should also acknowledge that 15 is a low bar for first place. For comparison,Kylian Mbappé leads La Liga on 39, Harry Kane the Bundesliga on 31, and Erling Haaland the Premier League on 27.Before anyone gets carried away suggesting that it might be twice as hard to score in Serie A as elsewhere, let’s also take in some mitigating factors. The figure would likely be much higher if Mateo Retegui – last season’scapocannoniere– had not left Atalanta to join Al Qadsiah FC in the Saudi Pro League this summer. He was on 13 goals already from January to May.Other plausible contenders have missed time due to injury. Gianluca Scamacca, Atalanta’s replacement at No 9, is only recently starting to show his best again after the cruciate ligament tear he suffered in August last year. Ademola Lookman missed preseason in a stand-off with the club over a desired transfer. Romelu Lukaku, first-choice striker for the defending Serie A champions Napoli, has been out injured since August.Still, it is true that this has been one of the lowest-scoring Serie A seasons in recent memory, with an average of just 2.327 goals per game. That is down from 2.561 in 2024-25 and 2.611 the year before that. Not since 1991-92 (2.271 per game) has the figure been lower, according to datacompiled by numericalcio.it.When such trends occur, there is rarely a single cause. Besides absences and departures of prolific players we might look to managerial changes. Atalanta – whose 78 goals last season were second only to Inter’s 79 – were forced to start afresh when Gian Piero Gasperini left to take charge of Roma after nine years in Bergamo. His first successor, Ivan Juric, lasted for 11 Serie A games, only two of which were wins.There have been signs of improvement since under Raffaele Palladino, though he was unable to break a long sequence of poor results against Inter specifically. Sunday’s defeat was Atalanta’s ninth in a row to these opponents. The Nerazzurri from Bergamo have not beaten those from Milan in any competition since 2018.View image in fullscreenRomelu Lukaku, who won the SuperCoppa with Napoli as an unused sub, is normally one of the most prolific in Italy.Photograph: Daniele Mascolo/ReutersPalladino did try something different, bringing Mario Pasalic into Atalanta’s forward line with the task of screening attempts by Inter to play through Hakan Calhanoglu. One thread in a greater scheme to ‘cage’ Inter’s playmaker, and a break from Gasperini’s old man-to-man approach. A plan that failed in part because of a strong performance from the renascent Piotr Zielinski alongside Calhanoglu.In the end, though, the difference was Lautaro. And Pio Esposito as well. He might be right that scoring is the hardest part, but the Inter academy graduate’s presence of mind to look for the pass was impressive. At 6ft 3in, he has the build of a natural target man and the best of those have always known when to be selfless and look for the runners either side of them.Lautaro has been one of Pio Esposito’s most vocal cheerleaders for some time now, praising his talent and work ethic while also beseeching journalists and fans to be patient. “We have to give him room for calm, the space to make mistakes,” said Lautaro again on Sunday. “I think he’s going to bring some great satisfaction to us but also for your Italian national team as well.”Quick GuideSerie A resultsShowPisa 0-2 JuventusUdinese 1-1 LazioTorino 1-2 CagliariLecce 0-3 ComoParma 1-0 FiorentinaAtalanta 0-1 InternazionaleBologna 1-1 SassuoloCremonese 0-2 NapoliMilan 3-0 VeronaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.For now, the burden of scoring the goals that keep Inter ahead in the title chase is one Lautaro is happy to shoulder. He remains, at 28, a player who divides opinion – ranking20th in both The Guardian’s top 100 polland the Ballon d’Or voting for 2025 yet drawing mockery from some critics for stating his belief earlier this year that he is one of the top five forwards in the world.Inter, certainly, are delighted to have kept hold of a player who, besides being Serie A’s joint-top scorer for this calendar year, also bagged 12 goals in 13 Champions League games in 2025. Losing the final of that competition for the second time in three years is also a part of the story, but there are many who never reach that stage in the first place.Afcon roundup: Mozambique stun Gabon to end 40-year wait for winRead moreLautaro, Inter’s captain, has spoken more than once about how devastated he was by the PSG mauling, of being unable to speak for the first five days. He had fought through injury late in the season to be involved at all, and the summer began on a sour note with reports of a falling out between him and Calhanoglu as the Inter exited the Club World Cup in the last-16.Only Inter’s players and coaches can know if the psychological scars of chasing four trophies last season, and winning none, have fully healed, but physically at least Lautaro appears back to his best. Asked on Sunday if some credit belonged to Inter’s fitness coach, Stefano Rapetti, Lautaro replied: “the whole staff. The years pass for all of us. I worked hard to get back into shape, but with lads like this behind you they raise your level. You have to want to keep growing. I have that desire every day.”PosTeamPGDPts1Inter Milan1621362AC Milan1614353Napoli1611344Juventus178325Roma167306Como1610277Bologna1610268Lazio176249Sassuolo1712210Atalanta1712211Udinese17-102212Cremonese17-22113Torino17-112014Cagliari17-51815Parma16-71716Lecce16-111617Genoa16-81418Verona16-121219Pisa17-121120Fiorentina17-119Explore more on these topicsSerie AInternazionaleAtalantaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Emery warned Villa must learn lessons from 2023-24, when they also had 39 points from their opening 18 matches but ended up finishing fourth.Despite failing to win any of their first six matches in all competitions and not scoring their first league goal until late September, Villa are third in the division, a point behind Manchester City and three off the leaders, Arsenal. Emery recognises Mikel Arteta and Arsenal will want revenge after losing the reverse fixture at Villa Park earlier this month, Emi Buendía’sstoppage-time strikemaintaining Villa’s winning run, which now stands at a club-record-equalling 11 matches after Saturday’scomeback victory at Chelsea.Arteta wants every team to ‘suffer’ at Arsenal with revenge on mind against VillaRead moreEmery has consistently downplayed Villa’s chances of being in the conversation for the title but caveated his position when asked whether supporters should temper expectations. “Dreams are free,” the Villa manager said. “Everyone has to dream. I have my dream and I am here getting my dream. My huge dream here and as a coach is to win the Champions League. That is my dream, all my life. The level I am, my dream is still to win Champions League. I don’t know if I can have again this opportunity.“Last year, we played quarter-finals, four years ago we played semi-finals [with Villarreal]. In each moment, I am realistic. The only dream I have now is tomorrow’s match. Of course, we can analyse how we want to build the team and where we want to get to. There are a lot of ways of where we want to get. But now, there is only tomorrow [Tuesday]. After tomorrow, we will see.”Emery referenced Villa’s identical position approaching the halfway stage two years ago. “We finished fourth, in the Champions League position, which was of course fantastic. But to speak about the title does not make sense for us, now, in December.”Asked what Villa can learn from that experience, the 54-year-old added: “We played a lot of matches, we played as well in Europe, got to the semi-finals in the Conference League and lost some players getting injured. We signed Morgan Rogers and he was performing fantastic, but four matches before the end of the season, he was injured. We were right at the limit.“With every player in the squad we must feel strong. Hopefully we can recover players and we can get to the second part of the season, after tomorrow, playing a lot of matches until the [match] day 38 like last year we did. Two years ago we struggled in the second half of the season. Last year, we were so, so strong. Three years ago, so, so strong. Each match, how we are managing everything, until now, wow, fantastic. If we are thinking today about day 38, the life is passing [us by] and we are not enjoying.”View image in fullscreenMatty Cash scored Aston Villa’s opener in their 2-1 home win against Arsenal this month but is suspended for Tuesday’s return.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersDiscussing Arsenal’s title credentials, Emery declared his former club favourites. “They signed players last summer to have two players in each position,” he said. “They are playing and competing fantastic; they have been so, so strong at everything. How they are building the team, each year they are getting stronger and stronger. It is the biggest test we are going to face this season.”Matty Cash and Boubacar Kamara are suspended for Tuesday’s match, for which Emery’s squad trained on Monday afternoon before heading to London. Villa’s game at Arsenal is their fifth away trip in seven matches and a third straight visit to the capital, after victories at Chelsea and West Ham.Emery said he is perplexed at the schedule pitting them against Arsenal for a second time before they have faced Nottingham Forest, whom they meet for the first time this season on 3 January. Villa have raised the issue with the Premier League and discussed the matter with the league’s chief football officer, Tony Scholes.“It is the first time in my career as a coach, 20 years, that we are finishing the first part of the season not playing against 19 teams,” Emery said. “We are playing 18 teams, with Arsenal two times. I don’t understand. I don’t know why. Normally we are playing tomorrow [on Tuesday] against Nottingham Forest to end the first part of the season. But, of course, I accept it.”Villa’s director of football, Damian Vidagany, suggested there is a bias in favour of the league’s biggest clubs. “I let you take a look which clubs are playing home both last and next match,” Vidagany said in a social media post. “It would be a disgrace if the fixtures become a political territory.”Explore more on these topicsAston VillaUnai EmeryArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

Sent off at 4-9, the five-year-old made all the running under Harry Cobden and needed little encouragement to maintain a one-and-a-quarter length lead to the line.Affordale Fury holds off Cheltenham Gold Cup and Aintree winners to take Savills ChaseRead more“Someone just said to me, how does he compare with your other Challow winners, like Denman and Bravemansgame and all those,” Nicholls said, “and he compares with all of them. In three runs over hurdles, he’s won two Grade Twos and a Grade One, and none of them achieved that.“To back it up after three weeks [from his last win at Sandown] is not ideal [but] we wanted to give him a nice bit of time before Cheltenham rather than go to Trials day [in late January] and it’s worked out beautiful, so we’ll go straight to the festival. I’d say that will be his last run over hurdles if that goes right, then we’ll go chasing.”No Drama This End was already the favourite for the Turners Novice Hurdle over two miles and five furlongs at Cheltenham in March before Monday’s race, and was cut to a top price of 4-1 to go one place better than Denman, the runner-up in 2006, and give Nicholls his first ever victory in the race.Classy novice hurdlers with the potential to be better still over fences are just what Nicholls needs as he tries to build back towards his former dominance and he will have taken particular pleasure from the success of Minella Yoga’s defeat of Act of Innocence, the 2-7 favourite, in the card’s Introductory Hurdle.View image in fullscreenOld Cowboy (centre, No 5) on his way to winning the Coral Racing Club ‘Join For Free’ Handicap Chase at Newbury.Photograph: David Davies/PAThe result had added significance for Nicholls as Act Of Innocence was among several horses switched away from his stable over the summer by his owners, Gordon and Su Hall, while Minella Yoga’s owner, Michael Geoghegan, has been a significant recent investor in Nicholls’s Ditcheat operation.“As you can imagine, I loved that, absolutely delighted,” Nicholls said. “He’s a very nice youngster and I obviously felt I had half a chance by running him against Act Of Innocence, and I couldn’t have had a better result, to be honest.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowHaydock12.35 Nazare 1.05 Wolf Walker 1.35 Ned Tanner 2.05 Sole Solution 2.35 Majordomo 3.05 Jupiter Des Bordes (nb) 3.40 Brentford HopeTaunton12.50 Innamorato 1.20 Le Beau Madrik 1.50 Fat Faced Columbo 2.20 Al Fonce 2.50 Square Du Roule 3.23 Faitque De L’Isle 3.55 Inferno SacreeWolverhampton4.30 Gifted Angel 5.00 Mister Moet 5.30 Havana Rum 6.00 Seeing Stars 6.30 Jamie Sommers 7.00 Credit Forgedd It 7.30 Ghaiyyath Park (nap) 8.00 Bownder 8.30 Son Of AstarWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“He’s one of the nicest youngsters we have and it’s great for Michael, who has heavily invested and bought a few nice horses with me lately.”Minella Yoga was cut to around 16-1 for the Triumph Hurdle at Cheltenham in March, and could take in the track’s trial for the juvenile hurdling championship on 24 January on the way to the festival.“He’ll definitely have an entry for the Triumph and I wouldn’t be afraid of running him in it,” Nicholls said.“You could definitely see him galloping up that Cheltenham hill OK.

I still have so much that I want to achieve in my career, and I know that Manchester United is the perfect club to join.“I feel that the team’s style of football will really suit my game, I hope my qualities and experience can help us to achieve our aims both in England and in the Champions League.”The 28-year-old from a town near the Dutch border scored more than 100 goals for Bayern across a five-and-a-half-year spell and issued a passionate statement of gratitude on their website, saying: “Munich has truly become my home. The team and the club have always been like a second family to me. I’ve developed such close friendships here that will last forever. That’s why it’s particularly difficult to take this step and leave my home, my friends and my family.“My years at Bayern have had a huge impact on me and will always remain very special to me. I’m going to miss you all so much and will cherish the memories – and that will never change.”Those sentiments were echoed in the German’s club’s statement through their director of women’s football, Bianca Rech, who said: “We thank her from the bottom of our hearts for everything she has done for FC Bayern and wish her all the best for the future.”Securing Schüller’s signature comes at a time when United appear to be gathering momentum, after qualifying for the Champions League knockout phase playoffs in a seeded position, reaching January’s League Cup semi-finals, signing the Sweden right-back Hanna Lundkvist on a three-and-a-half-year deal on Saturday and on Sunday confirming that the Japan midfielder Hinata Miyazawa has signed a new contract.Matt Johnson, United’s director of women’s football, described Schüller’s goalscoring record as “phenomenal”, adding: “Her style of play will give our attack an exciting new dimension. We are delighted to add a player of her pedigree to the group.”Explore more on these topicsManchester United WomenBayern Munich WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Some previous executives in the post have lasted only for short periods.The opening comes against a backbeat of warnings from inside the AI industry about the risks of the increasingly capable technology. On Monday, Mustafa Suleyman, the chief executive of Microsoft AI, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I honestly think that if you’re not a little bit afraid at this moment, then you’re not paying attention.”Demis Hassabis, the Nobel prize-winning co-founder of Google DeepMind, this monthwarned of risksthat included AIs going “off the rails in some way that harms humanity”.Amid resistance from Donald Trump’s White House, there is little regulation of AI at national or international level. Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist known as one of the “godfathers of AI”, said recently: “A sandwich has more regulation than AI.” The result is that AI companies are largely regulating themselves.Altman said on X as he launched the job search: “We have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities, but we are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides both in our products and in the world, in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits. These questions are hard and there is little precedent.”One user responded sardonically: “Sounds pretty chill, is there vacation included?”What is included is an unspecified slice of equity in OpenAI, a company that has been valued at $500bn.Last month, the rival company Anthropicreportedthe first AI-enabled cyber-attacks in which artificial intelligence acted largely autonomously under the supervision of suspected Chinese state actors to successfully hack and access targets’ internal data. This month, OpenAIsaidits latest model was almost three times better at hacking than three months earlier and said “we expect that upcoming AI models will continue on this trajectory”.OpenAI is also defending a lawsuit from the family of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old from California who killed himself after alleged encouragement from ChatGPT. It hasarguedRaine misused the technology. Another case, filed this month, claims ChatGPT encouraged the paranoid delusions of a 56-year-old in Connecticut, Stein-Erik Soelberg, who then murdered his 83-year old mother and killed himself.An OpenAI spokesperson said it was reviewing the filings in the Soelberg case, which it described as “incredibly heartbreaking” and that it was improving ChatGPT’s training “to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAISam AltmanComputingCybercrimeHackingInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Its first-responder service is comprised of about 150 experts worldwide. It has clients who keep it on retainer, victims referred by insurers, and “walk-ins”: people who suddenly realise their business is under attack and call the first few results on their search engines.In the case of the Scattered Spider victim, which the Guardian understands was not Marks & Spencer or the Co-op – two retailers that were attacked in 2025 – a 30-minute Teams call with a retailer became “a 24-hour call with a rotating cast of experts”, says Ted Cowell, the director of S-RM’s cyber business arm.“On average we’re getting back to clients within six minutes. Which is critical because often the first hours of a cyber incident can be the biggest chance window to determine the outcome of a case and its impact,” he says. “What can start as a network intrusion can then metastasise into a full-blown malware or ransomware scenario.”View image in fullscreenEmpty shelves at an M&S store. M&S was not the retail client that S-RM helped recover from a Scattered Spider cyber-attack.Photograph: Holly Williams/PACowell, a Cambridge-educated Russian speaker, says that getting a handle on the attack during a “reconnaissance” period can result in a radically different outcome, compared with a slow response. Criminals often need time after their first penetration of a businesses’ systems to work out what is of most value. This short spell of time can therefore allow experts to prevent the most operationally painful of attacks. “Exfiltration” – the theft of critical data – and encryption, whereby businesses can be locked out of their own systems, can be the most damaging.“Sometimes we can stop it from going boom,” Cowell says. Teams focus on “stopping the bleeding” by limiting or cutting the attacker’s access to systems. This is what S-RM’s team was able to do with the Scattered Spider victim: stopping the detonation of malware across systems.Business is good as thecybercrime industry grows, but that comes with ethical challenges. S-RM and its industry peershave faced criticismfor helping to facilitate the payment of ransoms to criminals who hijack businesses for money.“Extortion support” is an important part of S-RM’s work. This means its specialists are in the room when ransoms are negotiated, sometimes doing the negotiation itself on behalf of a client. Cowell appears keen to avoid criticisms of feeding organised crime by helping businesses to pay ransoms, or by acting for insurers that sell policies covering ransom payments.“We’re instructed by the policyholder, by the insured,” he says.“Our ambition is to guide ‘no payment’ decisions wherever and whenever possible,” he continues, adding that businesses are increasingly taking that approach and not paying ransoms.“Our role is to facilitate strategic thinking,” he says. “Give clients some structure to order their thoughts. They’ve probably not been in a situation like this before.“The businesses’ decision as to what they do is their own. We just offer the template of a crisis, how things play out based on our experience.“Why should we pay these criminals?” is a challenge Cowell says his team puts to top staff at affected businesses. “One of the things that we often educate boards on is that ransomware is an organised criminal enterprise.”These nefarious groups have, he explains, “brands to uphold”. Established ransomware groups, typically speaking, will honour a settlement. S-RM also has an increasingly detailed picture of how these groups have behaved in previous negotiations.The more established the group, the more likely they are to honour whatever settlement is agreed either by deleting stolen data or providing keys to decrypt critical files. S-RM offers a rundown of who’s who in terms of reliability, negotiating patterns, behaviours, even extending to sanctions concerns.The latter rarely applies, however. Trying to impose sanctions on state-linked groups is a game of “whack-a-mole”, Cowell says. If so-called “threat actors” do appear on sanctions lists they tend to disband and reform in a new guise. The risk of putting money, albeit indirectly, into state-enemy hands is therefore another consideration for firms facing a cyber-attack.View image in fullscreenProduction resumes at Jaguar Land Rover. Investigations into the cyber-attack on the carmaker identified Russia as a potential suspect.Photograph: JLRStill, businesses do sometimes decide to pay up. It can be rational for their company’s circumstances, and ultimately “it’s always their decision”, Cowell says.As the corporate moral code of paying ransoms matures, and decisions not to fund organised crime become more common, restoration and recovery services have become a bigger part of the cybersecurity response market. Increasingly it is a priority to just get systems back up and running as soon as possible with the forensic analysis of how someone got into a system becoming secondary.In recent years, the UK government’s cyber-intelligence role has also shifted significantly. The National Cyber Security Centre “over the last four or five years has hugely transformed”, Cowell says. The NCSC has caught up with its Nordic equivalents and now proactively reaches out to victims, telling them they may be targeted based on intelligence.“It was more of an information taker,” asking the likes of S-RM for information, which they would willingly provide with client consent, Cowell says.“[Now] they are playing a more robust role, getting on the front foot and getting people together tofacilitate information sharing. We saw the impact of that with the Scattered Spider attacks.,” he adds.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is my first real go at the genre, and it’s excellent. It has smooth, only occasionally cumbersome combat, sound design that scratches the brain just right and robotic enemies that genuinely terrify. And it satisfies my constant need to sift through my inventory and rifle through every drawer.But I have to keep my head on a swivel: Arc Raider’s player v player element means I can get jumped for my precious cargo by a malicious rival at any moment. And also, the knowledge that this game was made withthe help of generative AIvoice acting makes me slightly ashamed of how much I enjoy it. I play every game sheepishly looking over my shoulder (and my character’s) in case someone in-game takes my sought-after blueprint, or someone in real life kicks down my door to call me a hypocrite.View image in fullscreenShooting and looting … Arc Raiders.Photograph: Embark StudiosIt’s ever more difficult to avoid AI in everyday life. Arc Raiders has become my guilty pleasure. In it, you play as a raider in post-apocalyptic Italy, living underground but regularly heading topside to scrounge for supplies, after a massive ecological event destroyed human civilisation and strange autonomous robots showed up shortly afterwards to scour the scarred landscape. These ARC can fly overhead, roll around on the ground, or leap extraordinary distances on four mechanical legs. Each is uniquely deadly.You are woefully inadequate in a battle against most of Arc Raiders’ enemies, which means you’ll need to scurry around to avoid them, throw noisemakers to distract them, or attack as a team, with either the squad you deployed alongside or other players you convince to join you over chat. All of this is in service of the game’s one true god: loot, which you need in order to perform everything from repairing your weapons to crafting medical supplies to training your pet rooster so he can fetch items for you on the surface. And you can only keep what you successfully escape with, so if you die mid-match or fail to get to an elevator or metro car before the timer runs out, it’s all gone.Though my first few rounds of Arc Raiders were supremely difficult and punishing (in my third match, I found several pieces of rare loot and was then ruthlessly murdered by a squad all clad in red), Embark has ensured that you can make progress fast. You can upgrade your raider’s mobility, stamina and stealthiness every time you level up, and you can earn experience through playing rounds and successfully extracting. You can recycle things into crafting materials to upgrade your weapons and shield, or sell trinkets to merchants for extra cash that will help you buy better equipment. Even after a bad round, you still getsomewhere.After every successful extraction, I want to jump right back in for more. I want more close calls, accidental explosions and terrifying sprints through ruined cities. I want to hurl more expletives over chat so that other squads know I’m in the thick of it, walk past another player blastingA Thousand Miles by Vanessa Carltonthrough their microphone, usher another half-dozen more people into an elevator hatch before I press the button to close the door at the last second.Arc Raiders isn’t just fun to play.

The Murdochs are squabbling over Fox. Jeff Bezos has remade the Washington Post in his own image. The pharmaceutical magnate Patrick Soon-Shiong places a thumb on the scale at the Los Angeles Times, and the Trump-aligned Ellison family has taken over Paramount and CBS, and spent the final weeks of this year making hostile takeover bids for CNN owner Warner Bros. The influence of these billionaire personalities has often reshaped their organizations’ newsrooms and editorial boards, directing investigations and particularly opinion sections towards ownership’s pet projects and preferred policies.On the other hand, US media organizations are also facing tremendous pressure from theTrump administration– and from Donald Trump personally, who has used a combination of frivolous defamation suits and weaponized regulatory agencies to extract vast sums from outlets that publish coverage he does not like and threaten the licenses of broadcasters who host voices critical of his movement. He extracted a vast settlement from CBS over a shockingly banal concision edit to a Kamala Harris interview on 60 Minutes; he sued the New York Times over unflattering coverage; his FCC chair threatened to withdraw ABC’s broadcast license over comments made on air by a comedian.Swayed both by the preferences of their ownership and by the threat of retaliation from Trump, some major outlets have seemed to soften their coverage. Fearful of lawsuits from displeased subjects, they hedge their bets. Unwilling to buck Washington’s Maga conventional wisdom or to displease their owners, they reshape their opinion sections. There are still many journalists of great talent and integrity at these publications, but the results have been palpable. The quality of the outlets has precipitously declined: they are putting out worse work as the costs of putting out good work become greater.Between billionaires and the Trump administration, there is another incentive that has too often been compromised: the journalistic mandate to serve readers, and to tell the truth.Would it be too selfish of me – or perhaps just a bit gauche – to admit how many times, as an American opinion journalist, I have looked at the fate of my colleagues at other outlets and thought: “Thank God I’m at the Guardian”?The Guardianhas never – and would never – ask me to pull a punch in my opinion column, or to flatter someone whose power or protection the paper needs. The Guardian does not shape its coverage, in its opinion section or in its news reporting, based on what is politically expedient or what will get them into the least trouble. The Guardian is able – and, crucially, it is willing – to challenge the powerful. Other outlets ask their writers to compromise; the Guardian has never asked this of me.This is in no small part because the Guardian has no billionaire owner. It does not need to flatter his ego, or wield its opinion section to advance the interests of his businesses. It is supported, instead, by its readers – whose financial support bankrolls our investigations, keeps the lights on in our newsrooms, and pays my rent. It is you, not a billionaire, that we answer to, and you, not a billionaire, whose interests we are tasked with serving.At the risk of sounding corny, I’ll say that I am sometimes overwhelmed by my own eagerness for this challenge. To be a progressive voice in these pages, week after week, telling you the truth as I see it, has been the greatest honor of my career. As the media continues to flounder, unsure of profit models and unsteady in their navigation of the Trump era, there are fewer and fewer places where I would be able to do this kind of work. I’m grateful for this one.**Please support the Guardian’s year-end appeal today, if you can.Thank you for protecting the truly free press.Explore more on these topicsMediaThe GuardianUS press and publishingDonald TrumpTrump administrationMedia businessPress freedomcommentShareReuse this content"

The expectation was that, as the new duties drove up prices of consumer goods and inputs – affecting households and companies, respectively – surging inflation and falling real incomes would follow. This would be a supply shock, so the US Federal Reserve could not do much to counteract it.Trump did raise tariffs to shocking levels, violatinginternationalagreementsand blowing up the Republican party’soft-professedcommitment to free trade. In terms of severity and disruptiveness, Trump’s 2025 tariffs went far beyond the already harmful tariffs of hisfirst term, and even beyond the infamousSmoot-Hawley Actof 1930. According to the Yale Budget Lab, theaverage effective tariffon US imports rose from2% to 18%, the highest level since the 1930s, this year. Add to that the uncertainty caused by frequent and inexplicable policy changes, and largeadverseeffects on inflation, employment and real incomes appeared all but inevitable.But things did not turn out as anticipated. It is possible thatconsumer price inflation(CPI) did not rise at all: the most recentlyreported rate, for the 12 months ending in November, is 2.7% – the same level as in the closing months of 2024. (Of course, the pricelevelis higher, contrary to Trump’s claims.) Theunemployment raterose only a little, from4.1% at the end of 2024to4.6% in November. Economic growth probably slowed toward the end of the year, but the situation remains unclear, because a US government shutdowndelayeddata collection.Nearly half of Americans believe their financial security is getting worse, poll findsRead moreIn any case, it is pretty safe to say that the economic damage caused during Trump’s first year back in office has been smaller than predicted. There are four reasons why his tariffs’ biggest effects were limited or delayed in 2025.First, US economic statistics are unusually vulnerable to measurement problems, owing to the government shutdown, which stretched from 1 October to 12 November. Some CPI information is missing because the Bureau of Labor Statistics could not collect data as usual, particularly for October. Even in November, there isreason to doubtthat housing cost inflationamounted to zero, as reported. If true, this would bias the overall CPI estimate downward. GDP releases by the Bureau of Economic Analysis are way behindschedule, with the release of third-quarter GDP data having beenpostponed.The second reason we have seen less damage from Trump’s tariffs than expected is that many of the highest ones are not fully in effect. Trump has postponed some tariffs repeatedly. Herolled backothers on 14 November, because they were driving up grocery prices.Moreover, Trump introduced major tariff exceptions for some countries. For example, the integrated North American auto industry would have been devastated if he hadn’tdecidedon 6 March to exempt goods from Mexico and Canada fromthe 25%levythat hadgone into effecttwo days earlier. Goods from these countries now face no penalty if they are imported under the US-Mexico-Canada agreement.Trump regularly stakes out extreme negotiating positions, only to back down when the heat is onThis softening was predictable. US business would have suffered enormously if Trump had fully implemented the tariffs he had announced, let alone threatened, so it was never likely that he would persist with the worst of them. Trump regularly stakes out extreme negotiating positions, only toback downwhen the heat is on, even if he hasn’t gotten what he demanded from the other side. In fact, investors’ assumption that “Trump always chickens out” – known as Taco – has become a taunt. But when a madman threatens Armageddon, it is foolhardy to goad him into following through. The tariffs Trumphasimplemented are still very high.But this does not mean economists got their predictions all wrong. There are good reasons to think that many of the adverse effects of Trump’s tariffs have simply been delayed, and we should expect them to show up in 2026.This brings us to the third point: as soon as Trump was elected in November 2024, companies beganfront-loadingimports, in order to accumulate stocks of goods –especiallygold from Switzerland and weight-loss drugs from Ireland – before the anticipated tariffs were introduced. The Penn Wharton Budget Modelestimatesthat this strategy saved US importers as much as $6.5bn (£4.8bn) – equivalent to 13.1% of the new tariff bill – through May 2025.After the tariffs entered into effect, most retailers still didn’t raise prices, as they had not depleted their pre-tariff inventories. This is common practice among retailers, though an economist might say that it violates the principle of profit maximisation. Even today, many importers have still not fully passed along the added costs to their customers.In fact – and this is the final and most important point – importers have continued to absorb much of the cost increase, even after depleting their pre-tariff inventories. Using real-time data from large US retailers, Alberto Cavallo and his co-authorsfindthat thepricesof goods subject to the new tariffs – the imported products and their US-made substitutes – have beenrisingsince April. The increase, which amounted to about 5.4% at the retail level, has been enough to raise theinflation rateon the overall CPI basket by 0.7 percentage points above where it otherwise would have been. But it represents a small fraction of the costs that could potentially be passed through, at current tariff levels.Importers have continued to absorb much of the cost increase, even after depleting their pre-tariff inventoriesTo be sure, the prices importers pay haverisen proportionatelywith tariffs, contrary to Trump’s claims that foreign exporters cover the costs of the duties by lowering their prices. It is US companies that have been absorbing the costs, much as they typically do when the dollar depreciates. This partly reflects the fact that they have no idea how long the tariffs will be in place. Trump might change his mind, or perhaps the supreme court will decide to adhere to the law and strike them down. Thisuncertaintyalso helps to explain why many affected companies have so far refrained from laying off workers.But companies will not let tariffs erode their profit margins indefinitely. Assuming the tariffs remain, the US can look forward to more price increases, and downward pressure on real incomes, in 2026.Jeffrey Frankel is a professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard University.

A grand reckoning awaits usRobert ReichI’d like to believe that the horrific darkness of this past year is a necessary prelude to a brighter and saner futureMon 29 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 09.56 ESTShareAbout a year ago, at the start of theTrump2.0 regime, a woman was about to pass me on the sidewalk and then stopped, turned toward me and almost shouted: “It’s a fucking nightmare!”Ithasbeen a “fucking nightmare”.But sometimes a nation needs a nightmare before it can fully awaken to long-simmering crises.Martin Luther King Jrmobilized the nation against racial injustice by making sure almost everyone in the United States saw its horrors – on the nightly news, watching peaceful Black people getting clubbed and arrested for exercising their rights.Trump is shamelessly covering America in his name | Mohamad BazziRead moreWere it not for that painful national exposure to racist brutality, we wouldn’t have gotten the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act.Something similar happened in the first years of the 20th century when muckraking journalists revealed the monopolies, corruption and public-be-damned arrogance of the robber barons.Were it not for that painful national exposure, we wouldn’t have gotten the reforms of the progressive era.A similar dynamic is playing out as Americans witness the nightmare of Trump’s neofascism – its mindless cruelty, blatant attempts to silence critics, wanton destruction of much of our government, open racism and misogyny.Trump has revealed himself in ways his first-term handlers wouldn’t allow – as a sociopath who posts AI cartoons showing himself shitting on millions of Americans who marched against him. A malignant narcissist unable to respond to the tragic killings of Rob and Michele Reiner without making it all about himself. A chronic liar who says prices are dropping when everyone knows they’re rising.As Americans see all this, outrage has been growing. We are beginning to mobilize – not all of us, of course, but the great majority.Record numbers of us marched on 18 October, No Kings day. Democratic candidates have won just about every special election and every mayoral and gubernatorial contest, and a remarkable number of down-ballot races in bright red states and cities. Maga is coming apart. Trump’s polls are tanking.Trump has precipitated a long-overdue reckoning. That reckoning has revealed the rotWe are organizing and mobilizing with a resolve I have not seen in my lifetime.The US had to come to this point. We couldn’t go on as we were, even under Democratic presidents. For 40 years, a narrow economic elite has been siphoning off ever more wealth and power.I’m old enough to remember when the US had the largest and fastest-growing middle class in the world. We adhered to the basic bargain that if someone worked hard and played by the rules, they’d do better than their parents, and their children would do even better.I remember when CEOs took home 20 times the pay of their workers, not 300 times. When members of Congress acted in the interests of their constituents rather than being bribed by campaign donations to do the bidding of big corporations and the super-wealthy.I remember when our biggest domestic challenges were civil rights, women’s rights and gay rights – not the very survival of democracy and the rule of law.But over the last 40 years, starting with Ronald Reagan, the US went off the rails: deregulation, privatization, free trade, wild gambling by Wall Street, union-busting, monopolization, record levels of inequality, stagnant wages for most, staggering wealth for a few, big money taking over our politics.Corporate profits became more important than good jobs and good wages for all, stock buy-backs and the wellbeing of investors more important than the common good.Democratic presidents were better thanRepublicans, to be sure, but the underlying rot worsened. It was undermining the foundations of the US.Trump has precipitated a long-overdue reckoning.That reckoning has revealed the rot.It has also revealed the suck-up cowardice of so many CEOs, billionaires, Wall Street bankers, media moguls, tech titans, Republican politicians and other so-called “leaders” who have stayed silent or actively sought to curry Trump’s favor.America’s so-called “leadership class” is a sham. Most of them do not care a whit for the rest of the US. They are out for themselves.The “fucking nightmare” is not over by any stretch. It’s likely to get worse in 2026 as Trump and his sycophants, and many of America’s “leaders”, realize 2026 may be their last unrestrained year to inflict damage and siphon off the spoils.But the nightmare has awakened much of the US to the truth about what has happened to this country – and what we must do to get it back on the track toward social justice, democracy and widespread prosperity.I’d like to believe that the horrific darkness of this past year is a necessary prelude to a brighter and saner future.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

It defines a nation and its culture – and we must defend itTony Hall was director general of the BBC between April 2013 and August 2020Mon 29 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 12.24 ESTShareDon’t let President Trump cloud the real debate about the BBC. Of course, his demand for damages ofno less than $5bnhas dominated our thinking about the corporation over the past few weeks, as has its cause. But let’s get this into perspective. This was a serious own goal and journalists make mistakes. Salvation in this case would have been a line of script between the clips, or once a mistake had been discovered, a very speedy public acknowledgment. Now, though, the BBC is right not to yield on this. It has apologised. And, unlike other broadcasters and institutions in the United States, it doesn’t need the president’s support. This is a chance to demonstrate the BBC’s independence. Fight on.But we must not let this derail the conversation about what sort of BBC we all want and need, and I hope that is what dominates discussion in the crucial coming year. Thegovernment’s green paper, published in December, starts off with a reminder of what, despite all its travails, the BBC delivers for the country. “It’s not just a broadcaster,” says the introduction, “it’s also a national institution … if it did not already exist, we would have to invent it.” The secretary of state, Lisa Nandy, is even more forthright: “I believe the BBC, alongside the NHS, is one of the two most important institutions in our country. While one is fundamental to the health of our people, the other is fundamental to the health of our democracy.” Seeing the BBC not just as a media organisation, but as a cultural organisation helping to define who we are, is crucial to next year’s debate about what we want the BBC to be. It should be seen as part of our social infrastructure.I think people understand the importance of the BBC to our democracy in providing high-quality, accurate and impartial news. It remains the nation’s most widely used and trusted source of news. It is often the place where people go to check whether something is true or not. And of course globally, we all benefit from theBBC’s news services now reaching about 453 million people each week. This is an example of this country’s soft power which needs to be built on and not, as at present, diminished.View image in fullscreenA Daily Telegraph feature questioning the value of the BBC compared with streaming services, 19 December 2025.But what is less understood – or possibly even believed in – is the BBC’s role as the nation’s storyteller. The streamers do drama, people often say to me, so why do we need a BBC? Well, I’ve been as glued toSlow Horses,Down Cemetery RoadorAdolescenceas the next person. But the truth is that what the streamers like Netflix, Apple or Amazon are commissioning is content that will work on an international scale. And the total number of hours they make about the UK is not in the tens of thousands that the public service broadcasters produce. It’s interesting that audiences continue tospend more time watching BBC TV/iPlayeron average per week per person than they spend with Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime combined. In the first quarter of this year, the BBC hadfive out of the 10 most watched programmes in the UKacross all broadcasters and streamers. ITV had three and Netflix two. And that’s why the idea of public service broadcasting still matters.I watched the immensely powerful documentaryOur Girls– The Southport Families on BBC One, about the three girls murdered in the dreadful attack last year, illustrating the immense courage the families have shown coping with their grief, but also their desire to build something lasting out of the horror. I don’t believe it would have been made by a streamer. You could say the same ofLudwigor the Liverpool-basedThis City Is Ours. And the drama team on BBC Radio 4 – so often taken for granted and relatively unsung – commissions writers old and new on a massive scale to tell the stories that tell us who we are.When I was working for the BBC, we would shy away from the argument that the organisation was also a defence against market failure. Nowadays I think that should be part of why the BBC exists. There are certain genres of programmes that are not ever going to be internationally successful but reflect who we are. Programmes about religion, the arts, music, or shows that reflect who we are in a more gentle way, likeCountryfileorThe Repair Shop. And I lost count of the number of parents who told me how much they valued British content for their children either as toddlers withCBeebiesor later as teenagers withBitesize. And then, of course, there are those moments that bring us all together, from the Cenotaph to Westminster Abbey to the Olympics.View image in fullscreenSaoirse-Monica Jackson as Cheryl Crawford, left, and Hannah Onslow as Diana Williams in the Liverpool-based This City Is Ours.Photograph: James Stack/BBC/Left Bank PicturesTheBBCgives cultural definition to more specific communities too. When I was running the BBC, I talked to the people at Radio Cumbria, for example, who told me how their work helped define a community that is geographically very widespread, especially at times of crisis. These local services, whether in small areas or serving the nations, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, at their best report the stories that matter to their audiences and celebrate the characteristics that make them what they are. Taking this forward is an important role for the BBC.All in all, the BBC is the largest producer of stories about our isles, the people, the places, the communities that make up this diverse and creative nation. Of course, that has a value. The BBC is the largest single investor in UK-made programming, contributing about£4.9bn to the UK economyeach year, half of which is spent outside London.But an even bigger question is how and where our culture is defined. In the end, the only broadcasting organisations that will reflect the UK as its primary purpose are the BBC and Channel 4. Next year, the debate about the BBC charter will rightly encompass funding, governance, reaching new audiences and a host of other issues. But let’s not lose this idea of media as culture.Let’s enjoy what the streamers are offering. But let’s make sure we also have a properly funded BBC that reflects and celebrates who we are in all our rich diversity. And that in these divided times, we ensure that great programmes and services that inform, educate and entertain are available to all, whoever they are, wherever they live.Tony Hall was director general of the BBC between April 2013 and August 2020Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Or the perfume that reminds you of cat urine, the vase shaped like a brick, the hat that looks like an unrolled condom. Do you regift it? Give it to the op shop? What would happen if the giver were to discover this?I was given a painting by a generous friend – painted by an artist she knew. She asked me what I thought of it and I said it was beautiful. It was – it is – but it wasn’t something I’d have chosen for myself. It wasn’t my style and I didn’t know how to say this politely.On these in-between days I’m ‘growing down’, sinking into the present moment and savouring small delights | Nadine LevyRead moreI hung it in the guest bedroom but, when I moved house and had to downsize, I took it to an op shop several suburbs away, thinking I was safe in my subterfuge. Weeks passed before I received a call from this friend.“You took the painting I gave you to Vinnies!”Turns out her artist friend lived in the suburb of the op shop I selected. Worse, he often browsed there for canvases. Upon discovering his own art he bought it back then reported his horror. I felt like digging a hole in the earth and disappearing into it.“Why didn’t you tell me you didn’t like it?” my friend asked.To salve my shame, I had to ask others about their most embarrassing gift faux pas.One friend didn’t realise that when she advertised something on Facebook Marketplace it would be visible to all of her friends and relatives. So, when she tried to sell an unwanted gift, the giver (mortifyingly) messaged her.“I’ve since changed my settings,” she said. “So that what I sell is NOT visible to my family and friends.”A writer recalled a man she knew who took it upon himself to educate his (younger) girlfriends with gifts of books. He subsequently discovered all of the Jeanette Winterson novels he had bought one ex-girlfriend in an op shop, still bearing the loving messages he had inscribed.As it turned out, Winterson’s novels had helped the ex in her realisation she was more interested in women than men.Another writer recalled her artist mother giving a painting to a specialist as a thank-you gift, and years later a stranger later contacting her mother to say they had bought the painting at an op shop in a completely different part of the state.“My mother refused to believe that it was the same painting she gave to the specialist,” the writer said. “She never accepted that it went to an op shop.”From an artist’s perspective, it might be confronting to see your work in a charity shop, but what about a council clean-up?An artist I know had a friend discover one of her paintings in someone else’s house, hung in the living room. When asked where she bought it, the woman said she’d found it on the kerb.“I wasn’t deeply offended,” the artist said. “I was more delighted that someone picked it up.”As a novelist and frequent op shopper, I have checked the shelves for my own books and discovered signed copies. Even, once, a signed copy dedicated to someone I know.Was I horrified? No, because I’ve given away author-inscribed books as well. There isn’t room on my shelves for all of them.Is it Twixmas or Twixtmas? And other style guide conundrums we have faced this year at the Guardian | Charlotte Naughton and Katy GuestRead morePerhaps creators should be pleased their works are finding new homes. They’re not hiding away in attics or garages, or even worse: bins.The artist recommends honesty as the best policy when you receive a work of art you do not like.“Tell the giver it’s not your style. Say, ‘I would not appreciate it as much as I should.’“Art is personal and we only have so much wall space, you’ve really got to love what you put up.”But what if you have tried courage and failed, and you still have an unwanted piece of art, hand-knitted puce jumper or inscribed book?I’m reminded of the story of an international author who visited Australia and could not fit all the dedicated, signed copies of books she was given into her suitcase. Before flying home, she turned to someone she was with and passed her the books.“I’m going to need you to eat these,” she said.Eleanor Limprecht is the author ofWhat Was Left,Long Bay,The PassengersandThe Coast.

But then as a patient, I saw the love and the magicAnne PerkinsThere is something about the care and professionalism to be seen on a ward that defies abstract analysis: a reminder of what it is to be humanMon 29 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 12.24 ESTShareIwatchedNye, the National Theatre’s hit show about Aneurin Bevan, the former Labour MP for Ebbw Vale and his fight to found a national health service, twice. Both times it left me feeling a bit queasy. Bevan is a mighty working-class hero. Probably no other minister, even in that 1945 government of heroes, would have had the vision, the muscle or the sheer energy to make a national health service happen at all in those bleak postwar years, let alone in a way that no incoming government could unpick.TheNHSsits at the heart of politics and for most of my career in journalism, and charting the crises, the numbers, the arguments, the possibilities and the costs was a staple of my work. You can write all that, you can read about all that, but it can feel very different when events dictate that you cross the line from commentator to patient; when, like me, you pitch up as someone who arrives as an emergency, with a condition that might require major surgery and at least a week of post-operative hospital care – or might just go away of its own accord.There are other places in the world, I suppose, where you crawl into the emergency department wanting to die and are met with warmth and sympathy, competent professionals in more or less functional surroundings. It’s not, or not just, the security of not having to worry about the bill, because there are other ways of funding healthcare that are free at the point of use. I won’t pretend mine is a unique experience, or that all experiences are like mine, but proximity is important: having had the time to watch a ward at work, I feel there is alchemy in play here, and after six days with nothing to do but lie relatively flat and ponder, I think I may have identified it.At its heart is the sense of a shared destination. It’s like getting on a bus, maybe not the sleekest model and definitely overloaded, but we’re all on the journey together. Everyone who’s seriously and unexpectedly ill comes here. Everyone. You don’t lie in your narrow hospital bed imagining the four-star facilities you might be enjoying if only you had more dosh, because it’s odds on that if it’s an emergency, that person too is just behind the curtain hanging limply to your right.So there’s a common purpose among us all, and we all want to get to the other end. You don’t really want to die, at least not without some pain relief first, and they don’t want you to die either and are doing their damnedest to help. Somehow you know that even as you wait, cold with shock and in miserable pain, that you are seen. And counted.But something else happens too. All the time I was there, my neighbours on the ward were two older women who weren’t entirely sure where they were and one of whom very much didn’t want to be wherever it was. They both had chronic conditions. They were incontinent. They were uncooperative. But every hour of every day there were one or two nurses or healthcare assistants or carers who made time to answer their calls, to keep them safe and clean and warm and sometimes even to get a smile out of them.If you haven’t experienced it, it is hard to explain the effect of witnessing this level not only of professionalism and patience, but of love. There are studies that show that for all the criticism and brickbats aimed at the NHS, those who use it mostare the most positive about it. When you’re there and watch, you understand.As I began to get better (cheap date, no surgery) and was able to shuffle about my dog-eared old hospital, opened by Princess Anne sometime in the 1980s – about the time the Tory chancellor Nigel Lawson first started complaining that the NHS was the national religion – the feeling of common purpose I’d been aware of even in my fog of misery became even clearer. People are kind to one another here. The Friends Shop is hung with hand-knitted matinee jackets that emanate good-heartedness, and the manager of the WH Smith offers to help, rather than gesturing dismissively to the self-service tills.Strangers reach across the spaces in between to introduce themselves to one another. It’s not intrusive, it’s not compulsory, but it is unmissable: that heightened awareness and sympathy that makes three people swivel at the sound of a dropped crutch, that generosity of spirit that leads people to spend draughty afternoons showing confused visitors to distant wards.If we’re here, we’re in the same boat. We are in some way hurt, or we are supporting someone who is hurt, or maybe we’re making good on earlier kindness. It’s not magic. Everyone is still themselves, but softer. Warmer. Maybe even happier. Where else in our angry and atomised nation does this happen?Backstage, nurses wrestle with airbeds that fuse the ward’s electrics and radiologists need to sweet talk the X-ray machine into useful function. But somehow this superficially clapped-out, awkward, unmanageable old behemoth produces human beings to work in it who are capable of a resilience and love that is contagious.Bevan was driven by his own experience of want and avoidable tragedy. There are many things wrong with his creation. But whatever happens next in this most costly of long-running dramas, let us recognise the extraordinary value of what we already have. It is beyond price.Anne Perkins is a writer and broadcaster, and a former Guardian correspondentExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionHealthLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Do dinosaurs have capital letters? Is space measured in kilometres or miles? These are some of the questions we thought would be easy to answer when we were appointed as editors ofthe Guardianstyle guidein October.Journalists on the Guardian contact us every day wanting to know the correct style for the terminology in the articles they are writing or editing, and we need to make a ruling on each, or sometimes update an existing one. If there are style guide queries with obvious answers, we haven’t encountered one yet. One colleague asked if the abbreviation AI had entered the language, and was it necessarily generative or just gen? Another told us that if journalists drop the al- from Arabic names it is just like dropping the Mc from McDonald.The introduction to the 1960 edition of the style guide was headed “Neither pedantic nor wild”, and we try to live up to that maxim. There’s a trend towards the permissive in language, as well as towards American English, and we need to reflect how readers speak. But we are cautious not to erode the diversity and complexity of English as it has evolved in the UK.It’s a fine balance. Many of our readers around the world may understand kilometres better than miles, kindergarten better than nursery or sidewalk more than pavement, but our lexicon is still rooted in British English. We did make an exception tothe rule about acronymswhen our colleagues in the Guardian’s US office asked us to capitaliseICE. It istheirImmigration and Customs Enforcement department, after all, and a rule that results in confusing readers is a rule that should be bent. But Nasa and Nato stay as they are.In space, however, nobody can hear what measurements you use. When a reader asked whether we should be using kilometres in space rather than miles, we consulted the UK space agency’s chief scientist, Prof Adam Amara. He agreed. “In science, all measurements, including lengths and volumes, use the metric system,” he said. But he went on: “That said, once you get into space, we very quickly move away from the metric or imperial system altogether and we work with AU (astronomical units) and parsecs (a measure of distance)”. After much discussion we decided not to change the guide, which advises that “We use the metric system for weights and measures; exceptions are the mile and the pint.” We wouldn’t use kilometres first for a Spanish story, regardless of local usage, so we didn’t see why the rule shouldn’t apply in space.Sometimes, the language we use can be political. The tradition of taking the al- from somebody’s name when we refer to them by surname in a story seems rooted in a careless western convention, and we have decided to end it. We were helped enormously in this ruling by Dr Nada Elzeer, a senior lecturer in Arabic at Soas University of London, who expertly steered us through this complex topic, reassuring us that she had told us “enough so that youwon’t look stupid”.As for dinosaurs, there are convincing arguments for and against, but our job is to make a rule that’s consistent and clear. So you’ll find lowercase triceratops in the Guardian, just the same as hippopotamus. And bringing us right up to date, we think that most readers now know generative artificial intelligence as gen AI.There are some questions that we will take time over. We have already had a valuable discussion with the charity Mind but we have many more conversations to have about terminology around mental health. References to ethnicity, disability, sexuality and neurodiversity differ around the world and will always need updating.We want to be as open and transparent as possible about how we talk about the complex world we live in. And we want to hear from you. Perhaps you have expertise on a sensitive topic, or you just care about how we use words. We may not always agree, but we will always investigate, listening to all sides and making a judgment based not on our prejudices but onour principles: of honesty, integrity, fairness, courage and a sense of duty to the reader and the community. Please email your comments or queries to the readers’ editor atguardian.readers@theguardian.com, putting “Style guide” in the subject field.We chose Twixmas in the end. It is by far the most common usage, but lest anyone think we are pandering to populist dumbing down, we should point out that the old English word for between is “betwix”. Style guides play a part in the evolution of language, and we need to move with the times. But as you contemplate another mince pie in this downtime betweenChristmasand new year, we hope it’s reassuring to know that Twixmas traces its roots back to the old high German word zwiski, meaning two each.Charlotte Naughton and Katy Guest are joint editors ofthe Guardian’s style guideExplore more on these topicsLanguageOpinionChristmasThe GuardianNewspapersNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

Yes, there is – and as it happens, I’m sitting on a literal hill right now, feeding them. Pigeons. Why pigeons? Because it’s about time they get the respect they deserve.I like pigeons. Because they’re like me, working class. You can tell pigeons are working class because every pigeon looks knackered. It’s about this point in the conversation that people politely make their excuses and slowly back away (literally) while avoiding eye contact. No doubt, reading this, you are doing the same (figuratively).But aren’t you just a bit curious why, out of all the birds, pigeons are the most tolerant of humans? It’s certainly not mutual. No other bird faces so much hostility from us. Spikes, netting, “do not feed” signs – all things we inflict on a bird whose greatest crime is exhibiting an impressive lack of shame when it comes to scrounging our leftovers. Pigeons eat that bit of sandwich you’ve dropped on the ground with the same energy that one friend of yours thinks carrying only their drink back from the bar is an act of service.But we’re the tolerant ones, I hear you cry. Who told them they could live alongside us so brazenly? You’re going to want to sit down for this M Night Shyamalan-esque plot twist. We did. The year is 4,500BC. As our ancestors trade the nomadic hunter-gatherer life for farming, they have the bright idea to take the pigeon’s ancestor, theColumba livia,from the cliffs they live on and build them little pigeon houses so that they couldbreed themfor food.Soon, with a nice supply of pigeon nuggets added to their diet, our forebears begin to notice other things about pigeons, such as their excellent homing abilities. Unlike us, pigeons don’t need a combination of Google Maps, road signs and backseat drivers to find their way home. In further proof of their working-class roots, they just get on with it. Incredibly, they’re able to find their way home from distances of 1,000km.You know that civilisation you think was so great, and can’t stop banging on about? It doesn’t matter which one – Roman, Greek, Ottoman, Han, Mughal – they all used pigeons to communicate across their vast territories. That’s right, the first posties were pigeons. And the service was one we can only dream of: fast, reliable, not a single “sorry we missed you” card. Before the advent of telecommunications, it was pigeon messengers that allowed our cities, worlds and lives to expand. And it’s not just ancient history but our very recent history, as well.May I present Exhibit A, the pigeon fact to end all pigeon facts. The pidge de résistance. Pigeons in this countryserved inthe second world war. You heard. Such were the existential stakes for Britain, no one batted an eyelid when thousands of pigeons joined the war effort. There was a National Pigeon Service that had more than 200,000 serving pigeons. Nazi Germany had the Luftwaffe, the largest and most technologically advanced air force at that time, and we called up birds that eat floor chips. Nowadays, it would be considered w0kE and DeI g0n£ mAd to have pigeons in the armed forces, but back then they were there on merit.Not only that, but they performed heroically, successfully carrying out missions and saving human lives. Like Mary of Exeter,a pigeon-intelligence operativewho survived a German falcon attack. The tip of her wing was blown off and shrapnel lodged in her neck. And worst of all, she then had to go back to Exeter. It won’t surprise you to know that Mary was a proper member of the pigeon proletariat, who lived above a bootmakers. After each enemy attack, did she make a fuss? No, of course not. Instead of bothering doctors with her life-threatening injuries, she opted for something far more British, to keep calm and carry on cooing.“Oh God, what can we do to make amends?” I hear you cry out hysterically. It’s very simple. You can see them. Not like how you normally do, as if they’re not there. Butreallysee them. Spend a few minutes pigeon- watching. Maybe you’ll see what our ancestors saw thousands of years ago: a bird that’s not like other birds. A bird that’s a fellow commuter on this journey of ours, just trying to get through it like the rest of us. And if you’ve got a problem with that, you can find me on a hill with 20 hard-as-nut Lewisham pigeons.Toussaint Douglass is a comedian from Lewisham, south London.

But poverty and precarity are forcing vast numbers to emigrateMon 29 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTShareEarlier this month, the gardens of Rome’s Castel Sant’Angelo were filled with families enjoying some unseasonably warm sun by a pop-up ice rink. Teenage couples skated hand in hand, while the watching crowds sipped mulled wine and hot chocolate to a soundtrack of Nat King Cole. At first glance, itlooked like a normal Christmas market. The stands, however, revealed a different reality. Among the nativity displays and kitsch decorations were adverts for nationalist newspapers and something called “patriot radio”. On a wall near the kids’ play area, a mural depicted an unlikely cast of characters, tracing a lineage from the fascist poet Gabriele D’Annunzio to the late American Maga influencer Charlie Kirk.This was the setup I witnessed at this year’s Atreju, Italy’s biggest rightwing festival, which has been running since 1998 as anannual celebration of patriotismand nationalism. During the early editions, proud neo-fascists, including black-hooded thugs from street movements such as CasaPound and Forza Nuova, made up a visible portion of the attenders. At this year’s event, however, the Celtic crosses and odal rune tattoos were tucked under well-ironed shirts. The crowd was made up of nerdy students, gen-Z influencers, civil society campaigners and passersby who had been lured off the street by the glittery lights.Atreju is not a party conference. It’s a community fair, an old-fashioned outdoorkermesse, or fair, that is as much about myth-building as it is about politics. Fantasy fans may clock this from its name: bizarrely, Atreju (Atreyu in English) is the main character in The Neverending Story. First published, in German, in 1979, it is a work that Giorgia Meloni and her circle obsessed over while attending neo-fascist “hobbit camps” in the 1990s, gatherings where fantasy literature was used to soften the edges of hard-right propaganda. Meloni herself had a direct role in organising the first edition of Atreju, and writes fondly in her autobiography about her love of fantasy as a genre: a world where heroic idealists embark on a quest against evil.It’s worth noting that Michael Ende, the author of The Neverending Story, has had nothing to do with any of this. His novel is complex, and reflects on mysticism and the occult in ways that are impossible to reduce to a single perspective. Meloni and her colleagues, however, have imposed their beliefs on his fable, twisting its message into a simplistic political binary that, as far-fetched as it might sound, underpins Atreju today. On the one hand is a good Italy: made up of patriots who express nationalist pride in food, landscape and politics. On the other is a bad Italy: one of leftwing hooligans, gangs and non-European migrants.Previous editions of Atreju have run with themes such as “It’s time for patriots”, and “Conservatives’ Christmas” – in which panellists conjured up imaginary “woke threats” to the religious holiday. This year, the slogan was “You became strong …Italywith its head held high”, a strange blend of old-school far-right swagger and a contemporary gym slogan. In today’s context, it mainly communicated a desire to gloat.Which is understandable, to some extent: after all, Atreju is now the mainstream. In just 13 years, Brothers of Italy has gone from a tiny upstart force with just 2% of the national vote to the largest party in Italy’s ruling coalition, while Meloni is now one of the country’slongest serving postwar premiers, and lauded by eminent international publications. As one Atreju panellist put it: Italy was once chaos, and now it is stable and credible.For all the chutzpah, however, some in Meloni’s camp are worried. The PM underperformed in regional elections this year, and while Brothers of Italy’s polling lead isstable, there are the first signs that support may be peaking.For Atreju’s organisers, the answer was to keep the attention on Italy’s increasing prominence on the global stage. Not so long ago, the country’s political class had seemed content to play a minor role in international affairs compared with neighbours France and Germany. Not any more. Meloni has been more active than her predecessors, increasingeconomic investment in Africa, fostering closer ties with India and withdrawing from China’s belt and road initiative. She was the only EU leader present atTrump’s 2025 inauguration, and has expressed a renewed commitment to transatlanticism ever since.On closer inspection, Meloni’s international record is less robust than it first seems. Within the EU, she performs a delicate, often contradictory dance with the Brussels establishment she once derided. Her staunch commitment to arming Kyiv is perpetually undermined by her own deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, whose lingering sympathies for Putin’s territorial demands create a contradictory foreign policy. Even her supposed status as a “Trump whisperer” feels hollow. While she claims to be the bridge between Rome and Mar-a-Lago, her ideological kinship with Maga cannot shield Italy from the reality of US protectionism. The fear of tariffs is palpable among the standard bearers of Italian food and fashion, and an “America First”trade warmay yet devourthe very “Made in Italy” brand Meloni champions.Meanwhile, at home, the cracks are deepening too. On 12 December, as Atreju was in full swing, thousands across Italy took part in ageneral strike against a budget billthey say is defined by stealth cuts and a chronic lack of investment in public services. These arguments cannot simply be brushed aside. Approximately5.7 million peoplenow live in absolute poverty in Italy, nearly one-tenth of the population. And while the government is quick to tout rising employment numbers, the reality is a landscape of precarious, underpaid jobs and a stubborn refusal to implement a national minimum wage. Purchasing power has not returned to pre-Covid levels, and inflation is crushing consumer spending. No wonder, then, that Italy’s historic mass emigration is accelerating again. In 2024, 191,000 people officiallyleft the country, the highest figure in a quarter of a century.Unfortunately, the current government seems less interested in addressing these structural problems than in imposing even greater control over the narrative. In 2026, Meloni will shift her focus to a high-stakes campaign forjudicial reform, a move critics argue will give politicians excessive control over the state’s legal apparatus while distracting from the country’s economic emergency.With a fraught season of debate looming ahead of a referendum on the reforms in the spring,Brothers of Italysupporters would do well to reacquaint themselves with the the moment in The Neverending Story when the werewolf Gmork warns Atreju about the treachery of human politics. “Who knows what use they’ll make of you?” the beast snarls, as the hero falters in his quest. “Maybe you’ll help them to persuade people to buy things they don’t need, or hate things they know nothing about, or hold beliefs that make them easy to handle.”Jamie Mackay is a writer and translator based in FlorenceExplore more on these topicsItalyOpinionThe far rightBrothers of ItalyGiorgia MeloniEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Her work may not be great art, but it is a bawdy slice of Plymouth and postwar British life. An unlikelypairing with Tom of Finland, at Studio Voltairein 2024, recast Cook’s reputation as a queer ally. There will be drinking and smoking and ogling and people getting up to all sorts.Adrian SearleThe Box, Plymouth, 24 Januaryto 31 MayGwen John: Strange BeautiesSilence and solitude pervade the visionary art of this quiet hero of modernism. John didn’t take on the British art establishment – she simply ignored it. This graduate of the Slade ploughed her own route, living in France with almost no money, having a steamy affair with Rodin, for whom she also modelled, and painting simple, clear, spiritual images of women alone, and free like her, at a cost. Wales is right to be proud of her.Jonathan JonesNational Museum, Cardiff,7 February to 28 JuneLucian Freud: Drawing into PaintingOne of the greatest British portrait artists of all time can’t have enough exhibitions. This one delves into his creative process, exploring how his drawings grew into paintings – although he also demanded his models be there right through the work of painting. He wanted the subject present, even when he was painting floorboards and background. Freud’s drawings reveal the exactness of his eye, and are so precise they can be painful to look at.JJNational Portrait Gallery, London,12 February to 4 MaySeurat and the SeaView image in fullscreenThe Beach at Gravelines, 1890, by Georges SeuratPhotograph: CourtauldThis may sound soft but, if so, take a closer look at Seurat. This restless, deep-seeing artist followed his elders, the impressionists, to the shores, ports and seaside towns of northern France but his pointillist fragmented views – a rock towering over the sea; an eerily still and unpopulated harbour; a long lonely channel connecting Gravelines, near Dunkirk, with the sea – are brilliant and achingly desolate visions of modernism.JJCourtauld Gallery, London,13 February to 17 MayBeatriz GonzálezDepicting tabloid crimes of passion and political murders, Latin American feminism and social commentary, the Colombian painter and sculptor Beatriz González developed duringLa Violencia, the decades-long civil war that gripped the country. Her simplified, brightly coloured paintings, assemblages, furniture and installation, are a kind of vernacular pop art, reflecting on troubled times. González’s largest show in Europe, this will be a revelation.ASBarbican, London, 25 Februaryto 10 MayTracey EminIt is incredible to think that only a few years ago, critics were still sneering or even laughing at the wildest of the 1990s Young British Artists. What changed? Emin’s readiness to acknowledge she was no longer young, and to ruthlessly chronicle ageing, loneliness and a devastating illness, have made it clear to everyone her honesty is no stunt. Beyond that, her paintings have kept getting better, with her recentCrucifixionher greatest yet. Genuinely popular and truly original, Emin will give Tate Modern a boost in ticket sales and, if there is justice, rave reviews.JJTate Modern, London,27 February to 31 AugustAngela de la Cruz: UprightView image in fullscreenTransfer (White) with armchair (2011) by Angela de la Cruz.Photograph: © Courtesy the artist and Galerie Thomas Schulte.Slapstick and tragedy, pathos and humour come together in Angela de la Cruz’s paintings and assemblages.

All rights reserved, DACS 2025Continents swim in luminous oceans of colour. Frank Bowling’s art carries with it memories of places and people, journeys taken, voyages across the surface of the canvas as much as around the world. He was born in British Guiana (now Guyana), and his peripatetic art has taken him to London and New York and back again, in a show that maps his influences and affinities.ASFitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, 27 Marchto 17 Jan 2027ZurbaránHaunting and mysterious, the paintings of the Sevillian artist Francisco de Zurbarán (1598-1664) are filled with dramatic lighting, impenetrable dark and magisterial greys. His stilled, enigmatic figures have a theatrical, sculptural presence, and for all the inescapably Spanish baroque religiosity and tailored drapery, Zurbarán’s art appears peculiarly modern and strange.ASNational Gallery, London, 2 Mayto 23 AugustNancy HoltFrom pierced concrete tunnels in the Utah desert to the systems hidden beneath the floors and walls of our buildings, Nancy Holt’s art puts you in touch with the cosmological and the everyday. A pioneer of land art, environmental art and conceptualism, Holt (1938-2014) puts magic back into the world.ASGoodwood Art Foundation, West Sussex,2 May to 1 NovemberWhistlerView image in fullscreenKeeping Mum … Whistler’s Mother is being lent by the Musée d’Orsay in Paris.Photograph: Fine Art/Corbis/Getty Images… and his mum! The painting Whistler’s Mother (Arrangement in Grey and Black No 1) will be lent by the Musée d’Orsay for this survey of an American in Paris and London. Whistler was au fait with the French avant garde: in an 1860s group portrait of them he looks like a wild west gunslinger, putting Manet and Baudelaire in the shade. He then brought their modernist ideas to London, painting a sleazy gathering at Wapping and dreamy impressions of the Thames, all while taking the critic John Ruskin to court. The original modern art star.JJTate Britain, London,21 May to 27 SeptemberAnish KapoorYou can’t go wrong with Kapoor – he turns art galleries into adult playgrounds full of riotous visual spectacle and sublime fun. His recent work has explored new, provocative ground with sculptures and paintings that plunge into a red, visceral imagery of human flesh. At the same time, he has been exploring the nature of the ultimate black in pieces that are as much physics as art. This readiness to follow new, unexpected ideas on top of an already stunning career makes him a dangerous and exciting artist who is sure to keep you on your toes.JJHayward Gallery, London,16 June to 18 OctoberFrida Kahlo: The Making of an IconThe paintings, diaries and courageous life of this surrealist artist are endlessly compelling and a guaranteed hit for Tate. And why not? I think she is underrated. Our tendency to see her as a kind of performance artist and pop star belittles how good her paintings and drawings really are: so truthful, so frank, yet infused with mythology, religion and dreams. She invented this confessional approach decades before anyone else thought of it. Embrace this encounter with one of the truly great artists of the 20th century.JJTate Modern, London,25 June to 3 January 2027Ana MendietaWorking in sculpture, performance, film and photography, the Cuban-born artist Ana Mendieta put her body, its imprint and silhouette, at the core of her art. Displacement and absence were a recurrent theme. Mendieta left her trace everywhere, using water, flowers and fire, in film and photography, performance and sculpture, in all too short a career. In a career overshadowed by the circumstances of her death, her art remains vital and alive.ASTate Modern, London, 9 Julyto 10 January 2027Richard Dadd: Beyond BedlamBefore surrealism there was Richard Dadd. Monstrous fairies do unspeakable things in the overgrown grass of an out-of-scale garden, doctors and orderlies pose for staring portraits in lurid nature – Dadd’s world is a psychedelic hallucination, or bad-trip nightmare. His best known paintings were done in the asylum after he murdered his father while in the grip of psychosis. He was treated kindly and his art flourished, free from Victorian respectability. Venture down the rabbit hole.JJRoyal Academy, London, 25 July to 25 OctoberBayeux TapestryView image in fullscreenContemporary meaning in age-old embroidery … the Bayeux Tapestry.Photograph: Bayeux MuseumThe art event of the year, by some distance, has to be this once-in-a-lifetime triumph of cultural generosity by France. The greatest and most popular early medieval artwork comes to the country whose invasion by the Normans in 1066 it depicts in epic human detail. You can, and people will, find all manner of contemporary meanings in this vast embroidery, from a condemnation of war to nationalistic nonsense to proof that Britons are Europeans … but it is almost 1,000 years old and portrays another world, other ways of being. It will move and astonish you.JJBritish Museum, London, opens autumnMike NelsonIn 2004, Mike Nelsonburied a shack in a sand dune, in the upstairs gallery at Modern Art Oxford. Nelson’s work, with its mix of fact and fiction, history and fabulation, is always as engrossing as it is disturbing. For the 60th anniversary of the gallery, Nelson returns to Oxford with a new work, currently under wraps.ASModern Art, Oxford, opens autumnBeverly Buchanan: WeatheringRemnants and ruins, sculptural versions of sharecroppers’ shacks and other fragments of lives lived and hardships endured, are key elements for Buchanan (1940-2015). In her evocations of the complex conditions of rural African American life, Buchanan’s art was often sited outdoors, where tides and weather would eventually sweep them away. What remains is a key question, both as metaphor and memory. Belatedly, Buchanan’s time has come, in this first European travelling retrospective.ASSpike Island, Bristol, 26 Septemberto 10 January 2027LS LowryIndustrial northern scenes, sometimes teeming and sometimes empty, melancholic seascapes and weirdly vacant landscapes: you think you know Lowry’s art – and perhaps dismiss him – but there’s so much more to him than the matchstick-men cliches. Fifty years after his death, MK gallery mounts this first major retrospective in more than a decade.ASMK Gallery, Milton Keynes,24 October to 28 February 2027Van Eyck: The PortraitsThe early 15th-century magic of Jan van Eyck will captivate you in this show of his mesmerising portraits. Van Eyck used oil paint to mirror reality. He also pioneered perspective. These huge artistic innovations make him the first true Renaissance artist. Yet he worked in the medieval world of the Burgundian court and the merchant city Bruges. His masterpiece, the Arnolfini Portrait, takes you into a merchant’s house to ponder an enigmatic relationship between a woman and man: it will be presented here alongside other uncannily true-seeming images of grave, pale faces looking back at you like ghosts with secrets.JJNational Gallery, London, 21 November to 11 April 2027ArchitectureView image in fullscreenShimmering … the Santa Giulia Arena, designed by David Chipperfield for the Milano-Cortina Olympic and Paralympic Games.Illustration: Onirism Studio / David Chipperfield ArchitectsSanta Giulia Arena, Milan: David ChipperfieldIt’s snowtime as the Winter Olympics glide off in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo, with David Chipperfield’s 16,000 capacity Santa Giulia ice hockey stadium at the heart of the slippery action. Based on the elliptical form of Milan’s ancient Roman amphitheatre and wrapped in a trio of shimmering metallic rings impregnated with LED lighting, it gives modern expression to a historic archetype and will have an Olympic afterlife as a sports and entertainment venue for the city.Catherine SlessorOpens FebruaryYrjönkatu Swimming Hall, Helsinki: Väinö VähäkallioFinland’s oldest indoor swimming pool reopens after an extensive glow-up that preserves the character and ambience of the original pool hall. Dating from 1928, it’s a sybaritic example of Nordic classicism, designed by Väinö Vähäkallio, one of Finland’s most versatile early 20th-century architects. As swimsuits are optional, men and women partake of separate bathing sessions, while cabins around the pool’s upper level encourage patrons to relax with a glass of gin and lingonberries.CSOpens 2 FebruaryMaggie’s: Architecture that CaresView image in fullscreenMaggie’s Edinburgh, by Richard Murphy with garden design by Emma Keswick.Photograph: Eoin CareyOver three decades, a growing network of Maggie’s cancer care centres across the UK has created memorable and much-needed spaces for those dealing with the impact of cancer, away from a clinical hospital environment. Shaped by founder Maggie Keswick Jencks’ ambition to help people “not lose the joy of living in the fear of dying”, this exhibition explores Maggie’s pioneering approach to design, bringing together the voices of centre visitors, staff and architects.CSV&A Dundee, 6 March to 1 NovemberArchitecture Against Architecture by Reinier de GraafArchitecture, as we know it, may be coming to an end, contends Dutch architectural theorist Reinier de Graaf, and architects have only themselves to blame. The profession is out of touch, fixated by glitzy “starchitects”, and disdains to respond to wider social, political and economic change. In a provocative 14-point manifesto, De Graaf calls for unionisation, a mandatory retirement age, explains why we should stop building, and considers whether an architect should refuse a project on moral grounds.CSVerso Books, 24 MarchV&A East Museum, London: O’Donnell + TuomeyThe sculptural tailoring of Spanish couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga provides a jumping-off point for the V&A’s major new outpost in Stratford, east London. Designed by the Irish architects O’Donnell + Tuomey, the building appears as a crisply angular “folded dress”, giving the museum a distinctive form and striking identity. Helmed byGus Casely-Hayford, it will radically reinterpret the V&A’s collections through a contemporary lens, exploring aspects of representation, identity, wellbeing, craft practice and social justice.CSOpens 18 AprilDavid Geffen Galleries, Los Angeles County Museum of Art: Peter ZumthorView image in fullscreenLos Angeles County Museum of Art (Lacma) by Peter Zumthor.Photograph: Iwan BaanThe long-awaited public opening of the David Geffen Galleries sees Lacma’s permanent collection arrayed within a concrete and glass amoeba conceived by Peter Zumthor, who brings his USP of Swiss asceticism to LA’s contemporary art world. Elevated above a plaza, the exhibition level is a single flowing space with no prescribed visitor route, which the museum sees as a means of “eliminating traditional cultural hierarchies”, placing “all works of art on the same plane”. Literally.CSOpens AprilSkate Space 50Emerging out of a labyrinth of concrete ledges, pillars and stairs below Southbank’s Queen Elizabeth Hall, the Undercroft Skate Space lays claim to being the world’s oldest continually used skateboarding locale. First informally adopted by London’s skateboarders in the 1970s, it is now a permanent fixture on the skate circuit. As part of the Southbank Centre’s 75th anniversary, an exhibition will explore 50 years of the Undercroft Skate Space through photography, moving image and sound.CSSouthbank Centre, London, 7 May to 21 JuneBasílica de la Sagrada Família, Barcelona: Antoni GaudíA century after its architect was knocked down and killed by a tram, the fever dream of Barcelona’s Sagrada Família, a molten, kaleidoscopic basilica for the ages, reaches a climax of sorts. Construction will finish on the final, focal, Jesus Christ spire soaring 172 metres above the city, in time for the 100th anniversary of Antoni Gaudí’s death on 10 June. Originally, his elaborate stone forms were laboriously carved by hand, but digital technology now makes his febrile visions a reality.CSOpens 10 JuneGoogle headquarters, London: Bjarke Ingels Group and Heatherwick StudioGoogle’s UK headquarters is a 330-metre-long landscraper, as long as the Shard is high, butted up against King’s Cross station. “Continuously cascading work environments will connect Googlers across multiple floors,” says Danish architect Bjarke Ingels somewhat gnomically, but work drudgery will be leavened by an expansive roof garden, swimming pool, gym and cafe. Critics have called it the “Zombie Garden Bridge”, after co-designer Thomas Heatherwick’s now aborted proposal to connect the Thames with a landscaped crossing.CSOpens AugustKanal, Brussels: noAarchitecten, EM2N and Sergison Bates ArchitectsHoused in a remodelled and expanded former Citroën garage and showroom, Kanal is a bold new museum of contemporary art for Brussels. The former showroom is transformed into a “display cabinet” for installations, performances and concerts, while an internal street connects a trio of boxes containing exhibition spaces and a 400-seat auditorium. Energetically mining a quasi-industrial Tate Modern-style vibe, it is a tripartite production between Brussels-based noAarchitecten, Swiss practice EM2N and Londoners Sergison Bates.CSOpens NovemberExplore more on these topics2026 culture previewArtArchitectureExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Asura was a total knockout – a rich and sumptuously shot drama about four sisters in the 70s who discover that their dad has been having a lifelong affair. It was so good, in fact, that it might even be the most beautiful show they’ve ever released. Talk about selling yourself short.Watch it on Netflix.#1 Happy Family USAView image in fullscreenEasily one of the funniest shows of the year … #1 Happy Family USA.Photograph: Courtesy of PrimeNot content with creatingTV’s best sitcomabout life as a young, 2020s US Muslim, Ramy Youssef decided to createTV’s best sitcomabout life as a super-young 00s US Muslim. Packed with retro references to appeal to nostalgic millennials, and full of dark comedy about the US’s anti-Muslim bent in the wake of 9/11, it was a idiosyncratically satirical joy. Easily one of the funniest shows of the year.Watch it on Prime Video.Common Side EffectsIt’s not often that the year’s best conspiracy thriller is a cartoon. But that might just be the case, given the phenomenal watchability of Mike Judge’s animated tale of fungi expert Marshall, who finds a mushroom that cures all illnesses and even brings people back from the dead. When big pharma weigh in to stop his discovery ruining their profits, it becomes a wild, blackly comic tale of guns, death and love – plus how deeply in thrall the US is to profit. If this phenomenal show was an acted drama, it’s hard not to believe that it would’ve been one of the most watched shows of the year.Watch it on Channel 4.Mix TapeView image in fullscreenGorgeous … Florence Hunt and Rory Walton-Smith as young Alison and Daniel in Mix Tape.Photograph: BBC/© 2024 Subotixa (Mix Tape)/Leanne SullivanA gorgeous romantic drama that hadeverybody digging out their own mixtapesand sharing smile-raising memories. Pitched as One Day but grittier, the four-parter followed teenagers Daniel (Rory Walton-Smith) and Alison (Florence Hunt) falling in love in Sheffield, in 1989. Twenty years later, Daniel (Jim Sturgess) has stayed put and is a music journalist, while Alison (Teresa Palmer) is a successful novelist in Sydney – but unanswered questions from the past reconnect them. Each performance was affecting as dark truths unravelled and, crucially, the soundtrack was full of back-to-back bangers.Watch it on BBC iPlayer.Once Upon a Time in SpaceView image in fullscreenDazzling … Once Upon a Time in Space.Photograph: BBC/KEO Films/NASAFrom the makers of similar oral histories of the Iraq war and the Troubles, this dazzling documentary managed a remarkable trick. It was both a grand survey of the vaulting ambition of the space race and a very personal, emotional history explaining what becoming an astronaut actually meant to the few people who managed it. The indelible tales include African American astronauts who felt that their acceptance on to space exploration programmes showed that the times really were changing, a female astronaut who (temporarily) said goodbye to her very young child and the story of a lovely friendship between a Russian astronaut and an American one. The best bits of this series are genuinely unforgettable.Watch it on BBC iPlayer.Everybody’s LiveWhat made John Mulaney’s live weekly Netflix talkshow so absorbing was its full embrace of the medium. Shows like this tend to operate best when they find a groove, but Mulaney resolutely rejected this notion, preferring constant change to suffocating comfort. He’d let segments grind to a halt so that he could interview John Cale. He hosted a whole episode blindfolded. The climax came with his decision to fight two boys at once. Nothing else on TV in 2025 was quite this magnetic.Watch it on Netflix.Chad PowersView image in fullscreenWinning charm … Glen Powell in Chad Powers.Photograph: Disney+On paper, Glen Powell’s comedy was certifiably bananas. It was the story of a disgraced yet talented American footballer who (for genuinely inexplicable reasons) decides that his way back into the game should be to swaddle himself in complicated prosthetics and pass himself off as someone else. As creepy as this sounds, Powell managed to completely sell it, playing both sides of his split personality with the right amount of winning charm.Watch it on Disney+.The Horne Section TV ShowIn an age when television comedies are still defined by a sense of trauma, The Horne Section was the antidote. A brazenly silly 1970s-style sitcom about Taskmaster’s Alex Horne and his band trying to put on a weekly chatshow from his house, the show was loaded with big-name guest stars (John Oliver, Reggie Watts) having the absolute time of their lives. The whole thing was about as gleefully stupid as television gets. More please.Watch it on Channel 4.Long Story ShortView image in fullscreenShould have been watched by everyone! … Long Story Short.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixFollowing BoJack Horseman – one of Netflix’s all-time great shows – should have been an impossible task. However, Raphael Bob-Waksberg managed to return with something even more layered and complicated. An animated comedy about a Jewish family, Long Story Short spent its episodes flitting backwards and forwards through the years, leaving viewers to fill in the gaps of what happened in the interim. Something this personal and ambitious should have been watched by far more people.Watch it on Netflix.ReunionView image in fullscreenA real curio … Matthew Gurney and Lara Peake in Reunion.Photograph: Matt Squire/BBC/Warp FilmsIn an era of cookie-cutter crime dramas, Reunion felt like a real curio. Starring Matthew Gurney as Daniel Brennan and written by deaf scriptwriter William Mager, it put deafness at the heart of its story and utilised British Sign Language to dramatic effect. Reunion didn’t feel tokenistic in any way; instead, Daniel’s struggles to communicate – and various institutional failures to accommodate people with his needs – contributed to the air of despairing menace he exuded. As he returned from prison and attempted to reconnect with his daughter Carly (Lara Peake), his tragic backstory emerged gradually and the drama that resulted was nuanced, intriguing and eventually explosive.Watch it on BBC iPlayer.WaywardView image in fullscreenMasterly … Toni Collette in Wayward.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/NetflixThe eminently lovable Canadian standup Mae Martin has been a breezy Taskmaster star and charmed the pants off us in their tender and hilarious – if trauma-inflected – romcom Feel Good. So a bleak, supernatural thriller about a terrifying institution for troubled teens wasn’t exactly their most obvious next move. But Wayward was such a masterly invocation of the chilling ambience of small-town life, in which everyone seems to know something you don’t (aided by Toni Collette’s spooky turn as the local academy’s head, Evelyn) that it felt like the work of a seasoned horror writer. Martin’s presence brought the warmth and comic relief that was much needed with such dark fare driving the plot – and turned it into a must-watch.Watch it on Netflix.Lucy Letby: Beyond Reasonable DoubtEveryone knows the tale of how neonatal nurse Lucy Letby murdered seven babies and tried to kill another seven. Or do they? This compelling, meticulous documentary – featuring the Guardian’s Josh Halliday (who has followed the case from the start) as an empathic guide to the murky affair – takes you through the flaws in the case against Letby, alternative explanations for evidence that begins to seem far from unreasonable and the lack of any obvious motive for Letby to commit these crimes. It takes little-known, but hugely problematic, issues with one of the most infamous convictions of recent years and brings them to wider attention in a compelling manner. This is documentary making at its best – not just a TV show, but a public service.Watch it on ITVX.Down Cemetery RoadView image in fullscreenSupremely badass … Emma Thompson and Ruth Wilson in Down Cemetery Road.Photograph: Matt Towers/Matt Towers/Apple TV+Emma Thompson was the crime drama lead Gary Oldman wishes he could be in this second TV adaptation from author Mick Herron’s novels after Slow Horses. Unfailingly likable and supremely badass, while also capable of showing genuine humanity, Zoe Boem was a fantastic entry into the world of TV detectives as she tailed Ruth Wilson around a brutal hunt for a missing child, never failing to be zippily sarcastic as bullets flew and bodies piled up. This deserved far bigger audiences, but given that the antics of the Slough House ne’er do wells took multiple seasons to rack up the viewers, fingers crossed this manages the same feat.Watch it on Apple TV.Asterix and the Big FightView image in fullscreenBracingly modern … Asterix and the Big Fight.Photograph: PRAsterix fans have learned to avoid its animated adaptations, because you’re unlikely to ever find a patchier bunch of output. Happily, The Big Fight proved to be an exception. This series was deliberately, bracingly modern. It found an emotional backbone. It played with the form (complete with sports commentary, musical montages and a Pocoyo spoof). Plus it introduced a perfect new minor character. After all, if you live in a village with Asterix, Obelix and Getafix, wouldn’t you also want a Netflix?Watch it on Netflix.The Narrow Road to the Deep NorthView image in fullscreenSpellbinding … The Narrow Road to the Deep North.Photograph: BBC/Curio Pictures/Sony Pictures TelevisionBoth Jacob Elordi and Ciarán Hinds turned out spellbinding performances as the younger and older doctor Dorrigo in this sexy second world war epic about love, trauma and the things your psyche never lets you leave behind. Adapted from Richard Flanagan’s Booker-winning novel, it confidently paired tender scenes of love and poetry-reading with harrowing images of war, showing Dorrigo’s time as a prisoner of war forced to build the Burma railway. But despite being a visceral and often horrifying watch, it simultaneously managed to be a lovely tale of longing, as Dorrigo falls for his uncle’s wife Amy – and given how it turned out, it’s no wonder he spent a lifetime yearning to feel that way again.Watch it on BBC iPlayer.North of NorthView image in fullscreenFunny, charming and super snowy … North of North.Photograph: PRWelcome to the town of I​ce Cove​ in the Canadian Arctic, where everyone knows absolutely everyone’s business. So when Inuk woman Siaja explodes her life by publicly dumping the town golden boy (known as King Ting), she gets it in the neck – and every other local woman starts bringing Ting casseroles as love tokens. With episodes called things like Joy to the Effing World and ​Walrus ​Dick ​Baseball (yes they really do play it) ​this was a funny, charming and super snowy sitcom about growing up and becoming yourself. Perfect winter binge​-watching fare​.Watch it on Netflix.The EternautKiller snow that wipes out Earth? It’s one hell of a hook for a dystopia. But Bruno Stagnaro’s gripping Argentine story, based on Héctor Germán Oesterheld’s novel, also doubled as an absolutely terrifying reflection of our world. It begins with a group of men who are safely tucked inside playing poker. They soon learn that anyone who steps outside in the mysterious snow collapses and instantly dies. As they work out how to search for fellow survivors, they soon discover what is really causing chaos … Is there any hope? A second series has been confirmed to send chills down spines once more.Watch it on Netflix.ForeverView image in fullscreenFalling into you … Lovie Simone as Keisha and Michael Cooper Jr as Justin in Forever.Photograph: Elizabeth Morris/NetflixMillennials of a certain stripe will always have an indelible bond to Judy Blume’s Forever …, the tale of teenage love that was for many a first look at sex (complete with a penis unforgettably named Ralph.) So there was much excitement when this year brought us this adaptation, which updated the action to 2018 and centred around Black students Keisha and Justin, brilliantly played by Lovie Simone and Michael Cooper (rare actors in a teen drama who actually, and thankfully, look age-appropriate). As they went on trainer shopping dates and blocked/unblocked each other, we couldn’t help but fall for them as they were falling for each other. Lovely.Watch it on Netflix.Miss AustenIt’s been a bumper year for Jane Austen fans, as the BBC celebrated the novelist’s 250th birthday. But this lovely period drama, based on Gill Hornby’s bestselling novel, was a standout treat. Keeley Hawes played Jane’s sister Cassandra, who burned many of the private letters sent between the pair after Jane (Patsy Ferran) died. Through flashbacks to the sisters’ early years, we learn one reason that could explain why Cassie set them alight. Synnøve Karlsen, Rose Leslie and Jessica Hynes complete a wonderful cast.Watch it on BBC iPlayer.The AssassinView image in fullscreenA menopausal hitwoman with an axe to grind … Keeley Hawes as Julie in The Assassin.Photograph: Des Willie/Amazon Prime VideoThriller concepts don’t get much more fun than following the blood-soaked trail of a menopausal hitwoman with an axe to grind. And this Keeley Hawes-starring show certainly leaned into the chaos: monster body counts, shady corporate dealings, a twentysomething son forced to go on the run with his mum while simultaneously discovering she was a hired killer, it had it all. No wonder, given that it was the latest show from the Williams Brothers – the brains behind The Tourist, The Missing and Boat Story.Watch it on Prime Video.This article was amended on 29 December 2025. An earlier version said that in Reunion, Daniel Brennan attempted to reconnect with his daughter Miri, played by Rose Ayling-Ellis, however Miri is not his daughter. Brennan’s daughter is Carly, played by Lara Peake, and it was with Carly that he tried to reconnect.Explore more on these topicsTelevision2025 in TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There, on one of the walls, hung posters of Beyzaie’s 1988 film Maybe Some Other Time, positioned above and below the torn portraits of the supreme leaders of the theocratic regime.The symbolism – the ideological ruin; cinema and the future – was too striking for something so accidental, particularly given that Beyzaie’s theatre and cinema are intricate mazes of carefully constructed and overlapping allegorical moments.View image in fullscreenFrayed posters of Bahram Beyzaie’s 1988 film Maybe Some Other Time photographed in the ruins of Tehran’s oldest cinema, Cinema Iran in November.Photograph: Ali BakhtiariThe films of Beyzaie, who died on 26 December aged 87, are seamless blends of myth, symbolism, folklore, and classical Persian literature. Within their dizzying labyrinth of rituals, cinema becomes an act of dreaming.Outside the cinema, his profound devotion to Iran’s performing arts and literary traditions – both pre- and post-Islamic – resulted in the publication of more than 70 books, including histories, plays and screenplays.Beyzaie was born on 26 December 1938, into a Bahá’í family in Tehran. His belonging to a frequently persecuted religious minority became, particularly after the 1979 revolution, one of the factors contributing to the censorship of his work.He began writing plays and film criticism at a very young age, and his now canonical book Theatre in Iran was published when he was only 27.Like his contemporary Abbas Kiarostami, Beyzaie entered cinema by making short films for Kanoon, the state institution dedicated to producing cultural works for and about children and young adults. His second film for Kanoon, The Journey (1972), which follows an orphaned boy’s search for his parents as it leads him through the polluted wastelands on the outskirts of Tehran, was Beyzaie’s personal favourite. Overflowing with abandoned objects, the film reveals a country discarding its history at a frantic pace.Beyzaie’s preoccupation with the world of children continued in his finest post-revolutionary film, Bashu, the Little Stranger (1986). In it, an Arab-Iranian boy displaced by war from the south struggles to adapt to life in northern Iran. Beyzaie masterfully links the fragmentation of national identity to language and the failures of communication.His first feature, Downpour (1972), directed through an energetic and unusual combination of neorealism and political symbolism, was made on a shoestring budget. It tells the story of a young teacher sent to a school in an impoverished neighbourhood, where he falls in love with his student’s elder sister. A jury at the Tehran international film festival, presided over by Satyajit Ray, awarded the film the special jury prize.View image in fullscreenSymbolism and neorealism … Downpour (1972).Photograph: Bahram BeyzaieFrom the mid-1970s onward, however, women moved decisively to the centre of his films. Their quests for lost or absent persons become searches for identity itself. Surrounded by men who are corrupt, paranoid and indecisive, women fight back and take up the sword – sometimes literally – to defend their territory. These films fuse the ceremonial legends of the past with contemporary life and move beyond the confines of the victimised female figures common in Iranian cinema.The Stranger and the Fog (1974), a bold attack on religious conformity and an uncanny anticipation of the revolution, marked the beginning of this new period. In The Raven (1977) – an inquiry into media, image, and memory – the woman is fully central. Here, she is a deaf teacher who becomes obsessed with the image of a missing woman. Her investigation uncovers a far larger lost identity: early 20th-century Tehran.In The Ballad of Tara (1979), which centres on the ghost of a dead warrior who falls in love with a widow in a coastal village, Beyzaie reworked the samurai epics of Akira Kurosawa through a feminist lens. The completion of the film coincided with the revolution, and it was subsequently banned indefinitely – not so much for its political symbolism as for its portrayal of a woman who is both desired and fully in command of her own destiny.From Travellers (1992) to his final film, When We Are All Sleep (2009), Beyzaie continued to offer variations on the theme of women searching for identity, often through the act of identifying others. These later works were developed in close collaboration with his second wife, the actor Mojdeh Shamsai.View image in fullscreenKurosawa through a feminist lens … The Ballad of Tara (1979).Photograph: Bahram BeyzaieMuch of this period, however, was marred by sustained harassment from the Iranian regime, including acts of punitive retaliation such as his dismissal from the theatre department of the University of Tehran, where he had taught since 1973. During periods when he was unable to work as a director, Beyzaie wrote screenplays that were filmed by others and edited other film-makers’ work. Eventually, frustrated by the situation, he left Iran in 2010 for Stanford University, where he taught in the Iranian Studies programme and staged plays he had long been prevented from performing in Iran.In the wake of his death, Iranian director Jafar Panahi said: “We learned from him how to stand against forgetfulness.” Another film-maker, Asghar Farhadi, noted the bitter irony that “the most [culturally] Iranian of all Iranians died so far from Iran.”There is yet another bitter irony. Two weeks before his death, what remained of Cinema Iran was burned to the ground, as if a final symbolic moment from a Beyzaie film marking the end of a major chapter in Iranian cultural history. Yet the restoration of Beyzaie’s classic films – including two undertaken under the auspices of Martin Scorsese’s World Cinema Project – has only deepened and expanded his reputation, both inside and outside Iran. This is a Cinema Iran that no fire can erase.The Ballad of Tara and The Journey will screen at the Barbican Cinema, London, in February as part of itsMasterpieces of the Iranian New Waveseason.Explore more on these topicsFilmIranfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I had tried standup in my last year at university, then did three open mic gigs at the Edinburgh festival which offered strong evidence that I should give up. So I did. Eighteen months later, after a vague plan to try to get into sports journalism ended with me subediting articles about stock markets for a business publishing company (even less exciting than you might think), I booked one gig, at theComedyCafe’s Wednesday open mic night, hosted by Daniel Kitson. If that had gone badly, I don’t think I would have tried standup again. It went well enough to carry on, and within a year I was starting to get a few paid gigs, and standup gradually became my “job”.Can you recall a gig so bad, it’s now funny?In about 2002, I did a show in Killarney in Ireland. A very popular local act had to pull out, and they asked me to headline the gig instead. It was in a hotel nightclub where it was cheaper to go to the comedy and stay for the music rather than just go to the music. So the audience was a mixture of people who wanted to see someone else, and people who wanted to dance. The response to my set was a fascinating cocktail of silence, hostility, confusion, apathy, resentment and pity. The noise of the disco then kept me awake until 4am.Any pre-show rituals?Be thankful I’m not in a Killarney nightclub.Do you have a comedy hero?I don’t really like the idea of heroes and hero-worshipping. I loved the comedic invention and satirical ambition of The Day Today and Brass Eye before I did standup. Seeing Robert Newman at the fringe in 2000 inspired me to try doing more political material. I studied Ancient Greek comedy at university, specifically the plays of Aristophanes. In footballing parlance, it is ‘total’ comedy – everything from political satire and literary parody to slapstick, puns and dick jokes. If only he hadn’t sadly passed away more than 2,400 years ago, I’d love to have dinner with him. With an interpreter.What’s been one of your all-time favourite gigs?I did a couple of gigs at Naveed’s Comedy Club in Dhaka in Bangladesh while I was covering the 2011 men’s Cricket World Cup forESPNcricinfo. Naveed had set up Bangladesh’s first comedy club a year or so previously and asked me to do a show there. It was in a tiny basement room in a block of flats, which he had kitted out like a New York standup club – brick backdrop, photos of Seinfeld, Steve Martin and others on the wall. It was a strange, wonderful and inspiring experience.Best heckle?In my early years in comedy, I did a lot of student union gigs. At one in Leeds, someone in the front row went to sleep. She did not fall asleep. She actively decided to go to sleep. Hard to hit back at that.I used to do my fringe shows in the afternoon, and if there was a test match on, people would sometimes shout the latest score at me. Which was helpful, but did suggest I had not entirely commandeered their attention.What has inspired your latest show,The Zaltgeist?The increasing impossibility of understanding the world and its politics.Does satire feel harder, easier, or simply stranger in 2025 compared to recent years?All three of those. Plus: more exhausting, more repetitive, and more cathartic.What’s next for you?Hopefully, watching England pull off the greatest comeback in cricket history to win the Ashes. Then back home for a new series of The News Quiz, and the Zaltgeist tour.Andy Zaltzman: The Zaltgeist ison tourfrom 13 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStageComedy Q&AComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)featuresShareReuse this content"

It’s not an impression anyone would be left with from listening to her bitter, potent take on indie-rock. Hagerup’s guitar lines snake as they thrash; her balladry is grimy and expansive, steered by febrile vocals that recall mid-period Fiona Apple and the drone of the cello she played as a kid. Unexpected moments lurk, such as the shadowy slip into trip-hop on recent single Dirty Dog.“One thing I really value about music is that it’s one of a few ways that I can really connect to emotion, even if the emotion is feeling disconnected,” Hagerup says. “Day to day, I’m pushing those feelings away. Picking up a guitar, you could write about all the beautiful, happy things, but there’s something that pulls your attention a little more sometimes – you get to release this thing you’ve been holding for weeks, to really find the nucleus of the intensity.”Calling from a friend’s place in western Massachusetts, Hagerup is self-deprecating and wildly expressive – her first espresso has just kicked in – and occasionally talks in circles around her latest album, System. To write, she says, she has to not necessarily know what she’s writing about: from opening song Easy, “I was sniffing a flower but I snorted a bug” is the kind of emotional trap door she sketches so well. Looking back on what the album might mean now, she sees “moments of struggle” as well as bird’s-eye views of the challenges of living in intentionally oppressive systems.Prewn: System – video“In the moment, I didn’t realise I was depressed – it’s like watching your hair grow, you don’t realise you’ve gotten to a place that isn’t how you like to feel,” she says. “I would have a lot of shame about feeling so depressed when there’s so much beauty in the world. But then that’s just another way to judge yourself when you’re already low.”The making of System sounded pretty painful: Hagerup staying up all night, forcing herself to write until some scrap of muse appeared to her. Looking back, she thinks it’s a result of the “immense pressure” people put themselves under in their mid-20s as they figure life out. “Hopefully as I’m getting older and more comfortable, I can approach music from less of a desperate … ” she mimes wrenching something out of the ground. “A lot of fear got wrapped up in it, but now it feels back to how it used to, like music is for the joy of the moment.”Dinosaur Jr’s J Mascis: ‘I still get a kick out of making a racket’Read moreHagerup came of age musically in the famed western Massachusetts scene, where she stuck around after college far longer than she had planned. Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore used to live there; J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr was a regular sight on the bike paths near where Hagerup lived.“He wears his helmet!” she says. “I love this area so much. It’s beautiful but it doesn’t have enough going on to be distracting. I hadn’t been in a DIY scene before I moved here. I was like, what, we just get together and make this happen on our own?! Seeing all the work that went into the community was so beautiful. It totally changed the course of my life, and it gave me a lot of courage to do music on a more serious level.” Nevertheless, she moved to Los Angeles in the summer: “I was like, what if I went somewhere that I could never imagine myself?”Since releasing her debut, Through the Window, in 2023, Hagerup has become used to her growing fandom seeming shocked by the darkness of her music. “I think the most powerful music is the most honest music,” she shrugs. “If it’s getting a little dark in here: well, chase that.” But as much as she sings about giving in, System is full of reminders not to fear “the sound of your broken, beating, dripping, heaving heart”, as she sings on Don’t Be Scared.“That’s another thing I really value about music,” she says. “If you’re not going deep into the dark side, I don’t know how you can go deep into the light side.”Explore more on these topicsMusicNew music for 2026IndieinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It defines a nation and its culture – and we must defend itTony Hall was director general of the BBC between April 2013 and August 2020Mon 29 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 29 Dec 2025 12.24 ESTShareDon’t let President Trump cloud the real debate about the BBC. Of course, his demand for damages ofno less than $5bnhas dominated our thinking about the corporation over the past few weeks, as has its cause. But let’s get this into perspective. This was a serious own goal and journalists make mistakes. Salvation in this case would have been a line of script between the clips, or once a mistake had been discovered, a very speedy public acknowledgment. Now, though, the BBC is right not to yield on this. It has apologised. And, unlike other broadcasters and institutions in the United States, it doesn’t need the president’s support. This is a chance to demonstrate the BBC’s independence. Fight on.But we must not let this derail the conversation about what sort of BBC we all want and need, and I hope that is what dominates discussion in the crucial coming year. Thegovernment’s green paper, published in December, starts off with a reminder of what, despite all its travails, the BBC delivers for the country. “It’s not just a broadcaster,” says the introduction, “it’s also a national institution … if it did not already exist, we would have to invent it.” The secretary of state, Lisa Nandy, is even more forthright: “I believe the BBC, alongside the NHS, is one of the two most important institutions in our country. While one is fundamental to the health of our people, the other is fundamental to the health of our democracy.” Seeing the BBC not just as a media organisation, but as a cultural organisation helping to define who we are, is crucial to next year’s debate about what we want the BBC to be. It should be seen as part of our social infrastructure.I think people understand the importance of the BBC to our democracy in providing high-quality, accurate and impartial news. It remains the nation’s most widely used and trusted source of news. It is often the place where people go to check whether something is true or not. And of course globally, we all benefit from theBBC’s news services now reaching about 453 million people each week. This is an example of this country’s soft power which needs to be built on and not, as at present, diminished.View image in fullscreenA Daily Telegraph feature questioning the value of the BBC compared with streaming services, 19 December 2025.But what is less understood – or possibly even believed in – is the BBC’s role as the nation’s storyteller. The streamers do drama, people often say to me, so why do we need a BBC? Well, I’ve been as glued toSlow Horses,Down Cemetery RoadorAdolescenceas the next person. But the truth is that what the streamers like Netflix, Apple or Amazon are commissioning is content that will work on an international scale. And the total number of hours they make about the UK is not in the tens of thousands that the public service broadcasters produce. It’s interesting that audiences continue tospend more time watching BBC TV/iPlayeron average per week per person than they spend with Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime combined. In the first quarter of this year, the BBC hadfive out of the 10 most watched programmes in the UKacross all broadcasters and streamers. ITV had three and Netflix two. And that’s why the idea of public service broadcasting still matters.I watched the immensely powerful documentaryOur Girls– The Southport Families on BBC One, about the three girls murdered in the dreadful attack last year, illustrating the immense courage the families have shown coping with their grief, but also their desire to build something lasting out of the horror. I don’t believe it would have been made by a streamer. You could say the same ofLudwigor the Liverpool-basedThis City Is Ours. And the drama team on BBC Radio 4 – so often taken for granted and relatively unsung – commissions writers old and new on a massive scale to tell the stories that tell us who we are.When I was working for the BBC, we would shy away from the argument that the organisation was also a defence against market failure. Nowadays I think that should be part of why the BBC exists. There are certain genres of programmes that are not ever going to be internationally successful but reflect who we are. Programmes about religion, the arts, music, or shows that reflect who we are in a more gentle way, likeCountryfileorThe Repair Shop. And I lost count of the number of parents who told me how much they valued British content for their children either as toddlers withCBeebiesor later as teenagers withBitesize. And then, of course, there are those moments that bring us all together, from the Cenotaph to Westminster Abbey to the Olympics.View image in fullscreenSaoirse-Monica Jackson as Cheryl Crawford, left, and Hannah Onslow as Diana Williams in the Liverpool-based This City Is Ours.Photograph: James Stack/BBC/Left Bank PicturesTheBBCgives cultural definition to more specific communities too. When I was running the BBC, I talked to the people at Radio Cumbria, for example, who told me how their work helped define a community that is geographically very widespread, especially at times of crisis. These local services, whether in small areas or serving the nations, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, at their best report the stories that matter to their audiences and celebrate the characteristics that make them what they are. Taking this forward is an important role for the BBC.All in all, the BBC is the largest producer of stories about our isles, the people, the places, the communities that make up this diverse and creative nation. Of course, that has a value. The BBC is the largest single investor in UK-made programming, contributing about£4.9bn to the UK economyeach year, half of which is spent outside London.But an even bigger question is how and where our culture is defined. In the end, the only broadcasting organisations that will reflect the UK as its primary purpose are the BBC and Channel 4. Next year, the debate about the BBC charter will rightly encompass funding, governance, reaching new audiences and a host of other issues. But let’s not lose this idea of media as culture.Let’s enjoy what the streamers are offering. But let’s make sure we also have a properly funded BBC that reflects and celebrates who we are in all our rich diversity. And that in these divided times, we ensure that great programmes and services that inform, educate and entertain are available to all, whoever they are, wherever they live.Tony Hall was director general of the BBC between April 2013 and August 2020Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There’s a lot for the creative director to reflect on: more than 5,000 events have taken place and £51m has been spent during a year that was by far the biggest city of culturesince the project started in 2013.Her personal highlights include the opening ceremony Rise in January, when temperaturesgot as low as -8C; seeing 600 people turn up to the start of The Bradford Progress – Jeremy Deller and Charles Hazlewood’ssprawling musical epicwith the Paraorchestra; and the exhibition of Victor Wedderburn’s photographs that capturedBlack Bradford in the mid-1980s.“Also how much audiences and people saw themselves in the work and all communities of that were recognised,” she adds. “The way artists have actually absolutely fallen in love with the city and the people and said, ‘We wouldn’t have known this place if it hadn’t been for this opportunity.’”The artistic director is understandably basking in the afterglow of a successful year. But as with the end of any city of culture, questions linger. Can the energy that was generated during 2025 be sustained? Will the talent who built the programme stay? Perhaps, most importantly, will the city experience an economic boost? In other words, what will the legacy look like?In Bradford those questions are particularly urgent. The city has some of the mostdeprived areas in the country. About 40% of Bradford’s children are living below the poverty line, while 12% of working age people have no qualifications. City of culture was never going to be a panacea but it offered some much needed optimism.View image in fullscreenBird’s eye view inside Darley Street market in Bradford’s city centre.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianWalking through the city centre, there are signs of the need. Next to the shiny new Darley Street market and in the shadow of colourful hoardings created by thelocal artist Ben Holdensit tents and empty shops. Homelessness and vacancies aren’t distinctly Bradfordian issues but it does havemore empty shops than most cities in the country.That backdrop partially explains why the celebrations were so wild whenBradfordwon the bid in May 2022. “Things like this don’t happen here” was the refrain that echoed but the circus was coming to town.Evie Manning, the co-artistic director of theatre company Common Wealth, recalls being told by a theatre critic for a national newspaper that city of culture was just “a branding exercise for failing cities”. At first the Bradfordian found the comment insulting but witnessing 2025 up close she recognises there’s more than a kernel of truth in the statement.“When you grow up here, you really do believe it’s the worst place in the UK because you are told that the whole time,” she says. “This year has made people look and think about living here differently. There’s a whole generation of young people coming up who won’t believe what I did about Bradford.”Gulzar’s task wasn’t just about curation or changing attitudes – it was also about a hyper-localised “levelling up” agenda and she wants to show me around some of the places city of culture investment has touched.We head to the 1 in 12 Club, which is run by anarchists and has been open since 1981. Located in an old fabric warehouse, it was showing its age. An initial injection of £90,000 was doubled after work started and the scale of the task in front of the collective who own the building became apparent. Fire doors had gaps in them, an old kitchen was more of a dumping ground, the electrics needed some serious TLC. Now they’re dreaming of installing a lift after receiving more heritage funding.It’s obvious why Gulzar wants to show me around the club: this is exactly the kind of thing that wouldn’t have happened if city of culture hadn’t come to town. “We’ve become more muscular,” says Gulzar. “The arts sector has gotten stronger. It knows that the work it makes is of consequence, it matters, it’s appreciated and it’s needed.” In total £9m was pumped into capital projects around the city, the first time investing in existing infrastructure has been part of the project’s remit.They also installed the first visitor toilets at the Brontë Parsonage Museum; relocated the Peace Museum to Salts Mill where its annual visitors increased from 3,000 per year to more than 50,000; and they installed a lift at Ilkley Playhouse. None of that is sexy. But in a city with a council that by its own admission faces financial challenges which rank “among the most significant in local government nationally”, it is work that simply would not have happened otherwise.Not everyone has been won over by the city of culture year. Ishtiaq Ahmed, an independent councillor from the Heaton ward of the city, is more sceptical. Although the event organiser says it put on events in all 30 wards, he feels not enough was done to bring in non-traditional arts audiences. “The whole point of it was that we kind of reach a wider audience,” he says. “Have we just reached those that were already in the know?Its impact shouldn’t just be felt by those who are already plugged in.”His other point is about legacy. He asks: “Will this investment lead to long-term funding, stronger grassroots support, opportunities across Bradford’s neighbourhoods or will the momentum just fade away once the banners come down?”We don’t yet know the answers to those questions, but the long-term health of other city of culture projects paints a difficult picture. Hull lost momentum once the chief executive of its legacy company left two years after its 12 months in the spotlight, while Derry hadno money for legacy projectsand Coventry’s post-event programmeended up in administration. All of those cities benefited from the year but turning the short-term investment into long-term uplift was very difficult.In Bradford, it’s not clear how much of the 2025 budget is left but it will be ploughed back into cultural events via Bradford Culture Company Ltd, with projects planned until 2027. The 200-capacity Loading Bay venue, which was a temporary space that hosted events throughout the year, will hopefully become a permanent – much needed – mid-sized venue.The delayed opening of Bradford Live has meant the city now has a 3,500-capacity venue in its centre. But whether the city can sustain it and the smaller Alhambra and St George’s Hall remains to be seen. Abundance is not a problem Bradford is used to having.The most important part of the legacy might be intangible though – the kind of thing that can’t be measured but felt. I speak to Jane Gray and Adam Metcalfe, two members of the Bantam of the Opera choir which was formed during 2025 and was composed of Bradford City fans who sang on Sports Personality of the Year.“At Bradford City matches now we’ve got a new chant and it goes ‘City of culture you’ll never sing that’,” says Metcalfe. Coventry and Hull fans might have something to say about that but the chant shows how much 2025 has bled into the wider community.Gray has been amazed at the impact city of culture has had.“I think it’s brought everybody together,” she says. “And things like the Darley Street market being finished, it just seems to have … a sense of hope and possibility. The closing ceremony was all about looking forward and people rising again. It was very empowering and I think that summed up this year.”Bantam of the Opera will continue beyond 2025, and many in Bradford will hope their cultural awakening does too.Explore more on these topicsBradfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So, we go to the ER. His heart stops. During those years he was drinking, he got cardiomyopathy; when the heart muscles get weaker, and they can’t pump as much blood out with each beat.”Doctors then placed him in a coma for eight days, before warning his daughter, Caley: “We might not get him back. We don’t know how present he’ll be. Prepare yourselves for the worst.“When he woke up, all he could do was use his voice,” she continued. “He has basically come back from the dead.”Chase himself has said that he has suffered memory problems since his hospitalisation, and in the documentary he fails to recall some of his past on-set and backstage controversies, including a fistfight with Bill Murray in aSaturday Night Livedressing room.Chase said he was “hurt” by his omission from the 50th anniversary special of SNL earlier this year, at which he was in attendance but not on stage.“Well, it was kind of upsetting actually,” he said.“This is probably the first time I’m saying it. But I expected that I would’ve been on the stage too with all the other actors. When [co-stars] Garrett [Morris] and Laraine [Newman] went on the stage there, I was curious as to why I didn’t. No one asked me to. Why was I left aside?”Chase, 82, almost died in 1980 when he was electrocuted on the set of Modern Problems, an accident which triggered a period of depression.Explore more on these topicsFilmChevy ChaseSaturday Night LivenewsShareReuse this content"

She said: “It gets very heated. We get some very juicy round tables. I love this gang because they play with their entire hearts … it gets really, really brutal.”She explained that during the celebrity series, they tended to say politely, “‘No, no, after you’”, but, “That’s not how this one goes … they play it in an extraordinary way.”View image in fullscreenThe huge success of The Celebrity Traitors added pressure to the non-celebrity version, the producers said.Photograph: PHOTOGRAPHER:/BBCUsually in television, producers stay faithful to a successful format. But, speaking at a screening of the new series, The Traitors’ producers said that the success of the celebrity iteration had added “lots of pressure” on the regular version. So they wanted to “change the conversation slightly for this season” and introduce a new element.Mike Cotton, Studio Lambert’s creative director, explained that after The Celebrity Traitors, “we had parents coming up to us and thanking us for reintroducing them to watching TV with their teenagers and their children.“It became this big, huge family viewing event, which we didn’t really expect for a show that’s about murder and lies and betrayal. But obviously then there’s lots of pressure [put] on to the civilian version.”He added: “I think with celebrities all the viewers automatically knew who those people were; they knew why they were funny, they could easily connect with it. And when you go back to our regular version, these are people that you don’t really know – you’ve got to learn to love them.“Which is also why we did the [the new twist] because we thought it would change the conversation,” said Cotton. Hints about what the change is were dropped in atrailer for the showon Christmas Day that featured a red-cloaked Traitor.Since The Traitorsbegan in 2022fascination with its macabre missions and Winkleman’s outfits (this series her fashion inspiration is “full Oliver Twist”) has grown.Cotton revealed that all the coffins are made locally in the Scottish Highlands, where the programme and its US counterpart are filmed, and at Ardross Castle, where the game is played, there is a “weird death museum” housing props from previous series such as the coffins and celebrity heads – which then get recycled.The Traitors has prompted interest in group psychology, and Studio Lambert’s chief executive, Stephen Lambert,said in Augustit made him question how juries work.The justice secretary, David Lammy, recently revealed aplan to reduce the number of jury trialsin the UK, and Cotton said, “People do say the round tables are like a jury” and while it was “fascinating” how some players “become so convinced someone is a Traitor based on little or no evidence whatsoever … unlike actual court cases the faithfuls aren’t ever presented with all the evidence to decide if someone is guilty or innocent – they are instead relying on trust and instinct”.The Traitors starts New Year’s Day at 8pm on BBC1 and iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsClaudia WinklemanBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

Perhaps the poet was challenging herself initially to find the visible equivalent of thepareidolicMan in the Moon, often associated by English tradition with Sabbath-breakers and drunks. But there’s no nursery-friendly reassurance or comedy in the images Stevenson evokes in stanza one in order to reject them. The poem goes on to work out a denser portrayal of the man in the wind, where the figure retains political resonance, and its character as a threat to the civilised achievements and values of “our polite island”. It becomes a force of implacable nature, “without meaning or being”.In the first stanza, the “black monk” may refer to the bringer of delusory insight in Chekhov’s short story The Black Monk. A “mirage” or “phantom”, always swathed in black, this visitor convinces the story’s human protagonist, Kovrin, of its actual existence in nature, and persuades Kovrin of his own super-human genius. (The whole story, translated into English by REC Long,can be read here.)The monk is found by Stevenson to be a redundant personification of the wind. Inadequate, too, are the more politically weighted images of power and abuse, which evolve from the cowering “white face under the streetlight” and culminate in images and sounds of torture, when “the prisoner’s risen voice / bleeds over cymbals and timpani”. The speaker rejects both the extremes of superhuman power and human debasement, although after-images from the stanza haunt the rest of the poem.Rhythmically, the second stanza suggests a moment when the wind drops and the noise is replaced by something else, perhaps the ability of a mind to hear its own thoughts. The (necessary) interpretation of the man in the wind is the man himself, in all his “anger” and “fear” as the wind rises once more, and emits “… a roar, a continuous roar” that will become human.A particular skill of the poem is the composition of its soundscape: sparing rhymes, attention to assonance, the breath-like patternings of long and short lines that unselfconsciously reinforce the natural vision, the connection of wind and breath. The poem’s engineering insists on a certain interplay of beginnings and endings; it echoes the rhythm of the human mind, both in its lineation and its drive to understanding. Stevenson also keeps the larger breath-flow of the wind intact: she lets us hear the syntax-defying roar, a crescendo of sound unlike, though not entirely unrelated to, the “melancholy, long withdrawing roar” of the Sea of Faith in Matthew Arnold’sDover Beach.This wind-sound, compounded by the comparison to “waves where there is no shore”, shrinks the human time-span, the whole hypothetical time-horizon and the myth of beginnings and endings. It brilliantly “uncreates” the world, and makes us hear the terrifyingly unmanned and existential gale. Although the poem might be read, partly, as an American poet’s examination of the political weather in her adopted Britain of the early 1980s, its reach towards a concept of nature is immeasurably vaster.Anne Stevenson (1933- 2020), was an award-winning poet and critic.

In his new book, he takes a keen-eyed tour of eight English houses, from Northumberland to Sussex, dating from the early 1700s to exactly 100 years ago, and ranging from an outlandish gothic pile to one of the first council flats. In Cruickshank’s pages, classical influences from Rome and Greece give way to a revival of medieval English gothic and the emergence of modernism.He is particularly interested in who commissioned and built his chosen dwellings, and how they got the job done. It’s a new spin on the recent fashion for historians to explore the homes of commoners, as opposed to royalty and aristocrats, in order to tell the life stories of their occupants. This probably began with the late Gillian Tindall, who wrote a highly original book about the various tenants of an old house by the Thames next to the rebuilt Globe theatre. That was followed by several series of A House Through Time, fronted by Traitors star David Olosuga.At first sight, Cruickshank seems to have set himself a thankless task – and dragged the reader into it alongside him. When it comes to establishing how early buildings went up, there isn’t a lot to go on. “Few contemporary or intimate documents – such as letters or diary entries – survive in significant number that chronicle [their] creation,” he says. But all is not lost. “What does survive are building accounts that list names of tradesmen, sums charged and dates on which bills were paid.” He concedes that this throws up “somewhat arid evidence”, and he isn’t kidding: for lengthy stretches, “The English House” is constructed out of yellowed builder’s dockets mashed up with dense architectural jargon (“… a semi-elliptical colonnade formed by four free-standing Ionic columns supporting a full entablature and flanked by pedimented door surrounds”). Cruickshank could be forgiven for wishing that his book was accompanied by a TV series – with graphics to explain various construction techniques – and if so, he wouldn’t be the only one.View image in fullscreenThe kitchen at Cragside, an Arts and Crafts mansion in Northumberland.Photograph: The National Trust Photolibrary/AlamyA house is not a home, as Bacharach and David rightly told us, and fortunately Cruickshank’s research ends up revealing a surprising amount about the inhabitants of his eight properties. Pallant House in Chichester, now an art gallery, was the scene of lively arguments between the young swell who commissioned it and his older wife who paid for it all. This didn’t go unnoticed by their tradesmen, whose records of work on the house expose the couple’s frequent disagreements about what should go where and how much they should fork out for it. In Hull, a man called Henry Maisen built a fine house for himself in the mid-18th century but left most of the work to his brother, Nathaniel, while he enjoyed himself in London. In 1744, Nathaniel wrote him an exasperated letter care of “Mrs Rawlinson’s, A Toy Shop, Bedford Street, Covent Garden”. This was a red-light district, and as Cruickshank notes, the first children’s toy shop in the capital wouldn’t be open for another 16 years – so “it seems not unlikely that the toys available at Mrs Rawlinson’s were of a distinctly adult nature”.If the author is a little uncomfortable with this evidence of the ageless human comedy, he’s more receptive to the darker stories he uncovers. The Boundary Street estate in London’s Shoreditch, begun in the 1890s, was home to the first council flat “as we know it”, says Cruickshank. Though it replaced a notorious and fetid slum, most of the luckless inhabitants of the rookery were moved on rather than rehoused. A banker’s residence in Liverpool prompts an exploration of the port’s role in the transatlantic slave trade. A house built by Huguenots in Spitalfields, east London, might nowadays be close to the homes of millionaire artists including Tracey Emin and Gilbert and George (and of Cruickshank himself, though he doesn’t say so) but these French Protestants, fleeing Louis XIV, were only the first wave of embattled immigrants on the premises. It was later a synagogue, now abandoned. “It takes only a little imagination to fill its shadowy corners with spectres, and it’s hard not to strain to hear the voices of the long dead.”The English House: A History in Eight Buildings by Dan Cruickshank is published by Hutchinson Heinemann, £26.

A year before the award-lassoing Facebook drama, which led to an Oscar nomination for Eisenberg, the actor agonised through the dreamy foreground of Adventureland as reluctant carny James Brennan.The parallels between Fincher’s and Greg Mottola’s movies begin and end with their opening unceremonious separations, yet an admittedly romantic logic does allow me to soak in the notion that the great directorial mind behind such zingers as Zodiac and Gone Girl also found solace in this cinematic time machine.Bouncing through the year 1987 under a cloud of weed and Lou Reed, wannabe “travel essayist” James suffers a reality check when his dad’s demotion means that the family can no longer fund a planned European jolly with his best mate, Eric.‘Cue air punches and tears’: why Next Goal Wins is my feelgood movieRead moreFaced with an empty summer before studying at Columbia University, the Charles Darwin acolyte manages to bag himself a job at the titular theme park, where amusement stations are inexplicably slapped with names like the Flighing Dutchman. “You got a concussion on the teacup ride there when you were six,” is his mum’s scepticism that doubles down on our protagonist’s unsuitability for Adventureland. The delicious thing about this retro limbo realm of yawning-clown bins, unashamedly rigged games and Tilt-A-Whirls is the fact that almost none of its poorly paid denizens belong there.Take maintenance guy Connell for instance, played byRyan Reynolds. He’s coolly tricked everyone into believing that he once jammed with the aforementioned Velvet Underground legend; swaggering through the ice-cream and candy floss chaos like some sort of god while his admiring co-workers wave from their various vomit-stained habitats.Adventureland’s evergreen feelgood factor is partly associated with the pre-Deadpool era, where future world-beater Reynolds wasn’t indulged by major Hollywood studios to essentially play a carbon copy of himself in a superhero gimp suit, or to front sappy football documentaries with that trademark toilet wit. Here, he’s tethered to a specific lovelorn reality wherenobodycan go home with a plush “giant ass panda”. That’s a warning delivered early doors by Bill Hader’s unhinged park co-runner Bobby – “Just gimme a fucking reason, you don’t know what I’m capable of!” he seethes at a jock wanting to knock seven shades out of James – the star reteaming with Superbad director Mottola for a much richer and sophisticated portrait of YA yearning.Just like that movie’s Seth, Evan and McLovin, James spends the duration negotiating the awkwardness of the “Scarlet V”, while his hyaena-like torturer Frigo pummels him with bollock-busting jabs in front of the very girls he hopes to slide into bed with. The big difference between Adventureland and every other coming-of-age comedy of my lifetime, though, is its soul-lifting nostalgia neatly embodied by the now-fossilising funfair. I’m so taken by this iconography of yesteryear that I even bought the same blue T-shirt that James wears for his uniform (it’s been reduced to a fence-painting scruff over the years). Ironically, you’ll never catch me on a rollercoaster. Riddle me that one?Mottola’s 2009 movie continues to reel me back in as a memory portal to my first-ever job too. Making friends at a local clothing shop located next-door to my favourite haunt: the cinema; the pranks we’d often pull on each other to get through the days; the nights out together; surprise hook-ups; that blissful sense of freedom before life got real, and the silly energy of a busy seasonal period. It was all about the people on shift with you and Adventureland is an echo of those times, encased in celluloid. “I’m amazed at how tiny my paycheck is, I’ve been working doubles …” James complains to Joel (Martin Starr), which is sardonically met with: “Well, we are doing the work of lazy, pathetic morons.” Fair play to all of the retail staff out there, especially over Christmas, but these quotes really did ring true for me way back when.Then there’s a soundtrack beamed in from the 80s, painting sequences (including a stoned session on the dodgems) with the colours of David Bowie, the Replacements, INXS, Crowded House and the Cure. Bastards of the Young blasting over the animated Miramax banner? This is both pure euphoric escapism and a cutting reminder that teen comedies peaked a long time ago.Adventureland is available to rent digitally in the US and UK and on Stan in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsJesse EisenbergMy feelgood movieKristen StewartKristen WiigRyan ReynoldsComedy filmsComedyRomance filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But this Israeli-Belarusian co-production is so excessively sentimental, cliche-riddled and arguably hypocritical considering its provenance, it’s not easy to forbear.It opens in contemporary Tel Aviv with an elderly man named Ilya receiving news he can barely believe is true: someone dear to him from his childhood is alive. This prompts Ilya to tell his grandsons for the first time about what happened to him during the second world war. Desaturated cinematography then unfolds his story in flashback, showing young Ilya (Andrey Davidyuk) and his little brother Sasha as preteen Jewish boys living in Minsk with their parents, just as the war starts. Dad goes off to the front and is never seen again; the brothers and their mother are soon rounded up by the Nazis, represented by one German actor (Jean-Marc Birkholz) who keeps cropping up throughout to ruin life for Ilya. It’s as if the production didn’t have enough budget to afford a second German-speaking actor or (charitably) because the film-makers are making some kind of symbolic point about the banality – or in this case indistinguishability – of evil. I suspect the former is the case.After a spell in a concentration camp for children, Ilya is separated from his brother and ends up living with a Belarusian couple who lost their own son. Despite the risk of execution they’re incurring by sheltering a Jewish boy, the couple treat Ilya like their own son, and the man gives him a home-whittled wooden stork that Ilya promises to give to his little brother one day.There are a few Belarusians who side with the Nazis, and Soviet-affiliated partisans steal the family’s cow, but by and large the film paints a very ahistorical, excessively flattering portrait of ordinary Belarusians, who are mostly keen to help these poor orphaned Jewish kids even if they’re risking being murdered themselves. Elderly Ilya’s voiceover narration even says at one point: “But even knowing the consequences, none of the locals refused [to help hide people].” There’s some serious nationalist self-soothing in the way this film depicts its locals as entirely saintly, which, given Belarus’s alliance with Putin these days, really stinks.Stork of Hope is on digital platforms from 5 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsSecond world warHolocaustBelarusIsraelreviewsShareReuse this content"

In contrast to more lethal forms of the sport, participants – orraseteurs– win points by snatching various ribbons attached to the bulls, each of which comes with a cash prize up to thousands of euros. Following a group of athletes of north African descent, Jérémie Battaglia’s documentary paints a captivating portrait of multicultural France.For Jawad Bakloul and Belkacem Benhammou, the two young men at the centre of the film, the hardships multiply. Because of their ethnic background, the pair encounter a world of contradictions when they step into an arena. Not only do they face mortal danger, they also face racial abuse from the older, largely white spectators, despite upholding a piece of traditional French culture.Battaglia’s film elegantly juxtaposes nerve-wrecking sequences of Camargue races with Bakloul and Benhammou’s daily lives. After each match, their uniforms of pristine white polo and trousers are stained with dust and blood. One particularly harrowing moment shows Benhammou struck by a bull, resulting in a brutal muscle tear. Even more disturbing is an earlier scene, in which a group of spectators callously complain of boredom when a bull is too docile.Passionate as theraseteursare about their task, they appear to be chasing after a mirage of valour for the entertainment of others. At the same time, systemic racism also prevents the men from gaining acceptance elsewhere – though highly educated, some are unable to find stable jobs. Battaglia’s poignant film is more than a tribute to the talents of these extraordinary men: it also lays bare how integration is rarely a two-way process, with the burden of assimilation largely placed on the shoulders of the marginalised.A French Youth is on True Story from 2 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsBullfightingFranceRaceEuropeAnimalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Walking the red carpet in London when the final episodes of The Crown premiered in December 2023, just two months after the 7 October attack by Hamas that triggered Israel’s war on Gaza, Abdallaheld up his palmsto reveal “return the hostages” written on the right and “end the occupation” on the left. On the backs of each hand were the words “permanent” and “ceasefire” respectively. Interlocking his thumbs, he made the shape and motion of a bird with his hands, referencing the peace dove.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThis symbol became a motif in his one-man play Nowhere, an exploration of what it means to belong – or not – thatpremieredat Battersea Arts Centre in London in 2024 and is coming to theSydney festivalin January.Nowhere blends the personal and political in a multimedia show that includes photography and footage, song and dance, performed by Abdalla. It interweaves his own life and family history with commentary on western colonialism in the Arab world, 9/11, the 2011 Arab spring protests in Egypt (which Abdalla and his father took part in) and Israel’s “genocide livestreamed into our phones”. Abdalla often rewrites the play’s ending to adapt to the latest developments in the Israel-Palestine situation.View image in fullscreenAbdalla interweaves his family history with global historical events and current affairs in Nowhere.Photograph: Helen MurrayNowhere is a vehicle for Abdalla’s freedom of expression against the backdrop of what he has described as an“alarming rise in attempts to censor voices that stand up for Palestine”. In March, Abdalla was ordered to attend aBritish police interviewover his participation in a Palestine Solidarity Campaign protest in January. “The right to protest is under attack in this country and it requires us all to defend it,” he wrote in astatement posted to Instagramin response to the summons.Police questioned him for a few hours, he says. “But the process from receiving the letter until having confirmation that there would be no further action was six months, and so you live under its shadow and the intimidation for quite some time.“I’ve got two young kids, I have a family and you worry at some level about reputational harm.“And yet it’s also an honour, because you know you’re doing it for the right reasons … On some deep level, it also linked me to my family history.”Weeks after our interview took place, on 14 December, two gunmen killed 15 innocent people during Hanukah celebrations at Bondi beach; 10 days later, New South Wales premier Chris Minns’ Labor governmentpassed controversial new powersfor police to ban street protests for up to three months.In an email after we spoke, Abdalla tells the Guardian he is continuing to adjust the show based on when and where it is being performed. “It’s too early for me to know what this will mean in practice [in Sydney] but the experience of Nowhere is also about what audiences bring to the show and what they are carrying. So, even if I wasn’t to change a word, I’m sure it will feel different.”View image in fullscreenKhalid Abdalla joined pro-Palestinian activists and supporters for a protest in central London in March 2024, calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war.Photograph: Benjamin Cremel/AFP/Getty ImagesBeyond its politics, Nowhere is also a showcase for Abdalla’s considerable talents as anEcole Philippe Gaulier-trained performer with roles spanning from London’sNationalandAlmeidatheatres to films includingThe Kite RunnerandUnited 93. “There’s this gorgeous moment where he goes, ‘OK, I’m also an actor, and I’ve lived in a lot of places’,” the Sydney festival director, Kris Nelson, told Guardian Australia. “He just flips through all his accents, turning on a dime, and you’re like, ‘Oh my God, this guy’s very talented’.”Abdalla lost his broad Glaswegian accent around the age of five, after his family left Scotland. He grew up in London and studied English literature at Cambridge University and speaks with the cut-glassreceived pronunciationof the British establishment.He calls Nowhere “an anti-biography” in recognition of the fact that “the world shapes who I’m able to be … I’m put under the gaze of ‘an Arab in a post-9/11 world’”. The play asks “where is my agency?”, Abdalla says.The play’s title was inspired by former British prime minister Theresa May’sinfamous 2016 statement on citizenship: “If you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere.”That word continued to resonate with Abdalla as he contemplated “the genocide [and] this idea that nowhere is safe”.“And part of my political experience is in that sense of a lack of safe belonging,” he says.View image in fullscreenKhalid Abdalla in Nowhere at Battersea Arts Centre in 2024.Photograph: Helen MurrayNine months after being questioned by police, Abdalla is heartened there are more high-profile artists willing to “stick their head above the parapet”, including the actors and directors who havejoined a boycottpledging not to work with Israeli film groups “implicated in genocide”.Abdalla has been keeping a keen eye on freedom of speech in Australia and has been briefed by Nasser Mashni, the president of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network. When I bring up thecontroversy over three actors wearing keffiyehsin support of Palestine during a curtain call at Roslyn Packer theatre, where Abdalla will be performing Nowhere, he says: “Look, we’ve moved significantly from that time, right? There is a massive shifting global consciousness in relation to Palestine and solidarity with Palestine.”Abdalla says he was heartened to see thepro-Palestine march across Sydney Harbour Bridge in August. “Those are the images that come to my mind in terms of who I imagine I’m coming to encounter [in Sydney],” he says.View image in fullscreenAbdalla has used his red carpet appearances to draw attention to Israel’s war in Gaza. Pictured: Abdalla at the 2024 Emmy Awards.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesAt the same time, he says, “in every country, there’s this tension between what seems to me the majority global consciousness versus political power and the various corporate interests that act as gatekeepers to what you are and are not allowed to say, whether it’s in the media or in cultural spaces.“As we’re in a so-called ceasefire, here is where we set the ground for the journey of the next 10 years, so that it is truly the anti-apartheid civil rights movement of our time.”Theatre and the arts have an important role to play, he says. “It’s so important to have these gathering spaces where we can explore these things safely together, in a way that is meaningful and touches people’s hearts.”Nowhere by Khalid Abdallais at the Roslyn Packer theatre from 13-17 January as part of Sydney festivalExplore more on these topicsSydney festivalTheatreSydneyIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She visited schools across Britain and Ireland.Daniel Radcliffe, who was eventually cast as Harry, had already been spotted by David Heyman, the producer bringing JK Rowling’s boy wizard to the screen for the US film giant Warner Bros. He saw Radcliffe as a 10-year-old in the BBC’s 1999 adaptation of David Copperfield, playing the hero of Charles Dickens’s novel as a child.However, Figgis, who recalled saying: “God, he’d be good!”, then had to tell the director, Chris Columbus, that Radcliffe’s father, a literary agent, and mother, a casting agent, objected if it meant moving to Los Angeles.She herself was always aware of the potential pitfalls in catapulting children to fame. “You can mess up their lives if you’re not careful,” she said. “Kids who are good in one particular part often don’t go on to be adult actors.”Figgis and her associates started the search for another candidate to playHarry Potter, as well as Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger and their school friends, with the firm brief to see only nine- to 11-year-olds. The stipulation for casting adults was that they must be British or Irish, and Warner finally settled on filming in Britain.Rupert Grint started his long round of auditions as Ron by sending in a homemade videotape in which he performed a rap, while Emma Watson auditioned alongside others at her school in Oxford to play Hermione. Both had appeared only in school plays, with no professional experience.View image in fullscreenIn 2000 Daniel Radcliffe, centre, was cast as Harry Potter, with Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley.Photograph: PAWhen Warner was still not happy with the potential candidates for the lead role – after more than 40,000 boys had been considered – Figgis walked out on the production. But her belief in Radcliffe proved to be justified when Columbus and Warner went back to the idea of casting him in the part, which he took in all eight films. It also launched Radcliffe, Grint and Watson on careers that continued into adulthood.Figgis was born in Nairobi, Kenya, to Shirley (nee King), an antiques restorer, and Brian Figgis, a lawyer who had his own practice there and was the son of an Irish-born former KC. Susie’s cousin, Mike Figgis, became a director of films such as Leaving Las Vegas.When Susie was 10, in the dying days of British colonial rule, the family moved to Britain and she boarded at Wispers school, West Sussex, where her anti-establishment attitude led to many clashes with the headteacher. She always felt an outsider, later saying: “I was never part of the hip London trendy scene. I saw things differently.”Her career began as an actor touring in a London-based experimental theatre group, the People Show, alongside her cousin Mike, before she had the chance to work as the casting director Miriam Brickman’s assistant on the film The Assignment (1977), starringChristopher Plummer.Figgis then struck out on her own as a casting director, for television with the gritty drama Bloody Kids and cinema with The Wildcats of St Trinian’s and Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (all 1980).Her break came with Gandhi. Persuading Attenborough to dispense with ideas of casting a white actor in the title role, she eventually suggested Kingsley, who won an Oscar for his performance.In more than 100 films that followed, Figgis was equally adept at spotting new talent. Scacchi as the British colonial official’s wife causing scandal in India in Heat and Dust (1983), Tyson as an upmarket sex worker in Mona Lisa (1986) and Woof as Robert Carlyle’s ex-wife in The Full Monty (1997) are just a few examples.Visiting schools frequently paid dividends, such as when she discovered Lena Headey for the role of the younger Mary in Waterland (1992). She also brought international fame to Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury inBohemian Rhapsody(2018).Among directors who kept returning to Figgis was Jordan, more than a dozen times (mostly with the producer Stephen Woolley). The association began with The Company of Wolves, which starred Sarah Patterson, barely into her teens, as Rosaleen andAngela Lansburyas Granny, and included The Crying Game (1992) and Michael Collins (1996).Another frequent collaborator was the director Tim Burton on films such as Sleepy Hollow (1991),Charlie and the Chocolate Factory(2005), which featured a 12-year-old Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket,Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street(2007) and the live-action remakeDumbo(2019), with Nico Parker, also 12.Figgis found another 12-year-old, Jodhi May, at a school in Camden, London, to play the ostracised daughter of a South African anti-apartheid activist in A World Apart (1988), having visited the country to cast Attenborough’s film Cry Freedom (1987).In between the two, she had begun her passionate, secret support for the anti-apartheid cause. Recruited by the exiledEleanor Kasrilsin London to an underground network, she relayed secret communications, transferred funds and provided a safe house for ANC supporters passing through. One of those, Bill Anderson, who arrived in 1988, became her husband two years later.He, their daughter, Anu, and her stepdaughter, Ntsiki, survive her.Susan Margaret Figgis, casting director, born 24 March 1948; died 12 December 2025Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryHarry PotterobituariesShareReuse this content"

This is my first real go at the genre, and it’s excellent. It has smooth, only occasionally cumbersome combat, sound design that scratches the brain just right and robotic enemies that genuinely terrify. And it satisfies my constant need to sift through my inventory and rifle through every drawer.But I have to keep my head on a swivel: Arc Raider’s player v player element means I can get jumped for my precious cargo by a malicious rival at any moment. And also, the knowledge that this game was made withthe help of generative AIvoice acting makes me slightly ashamed of how much I enjoy it. I play every game sheepishly looking over my shoulder (and my character’s) in case someone in-game takes my sought-after blueprint, or someone in real life kicks down my door to call me a hypocrite.View image in fullscreenShooting and looting … Arc Raiders.Photograph: Embark StudiosIt’s ever more difficult to avoid AI in everyday life. Arc Raiders has become my guilty pleasure. In it, you play as a raider in post-apocalyptic Italy, living underground but regularly heading topside to scrounge for supplies, after a massive ecological event destroyed human civilisation and strange autonomous robots showed up shortly afterwards to scour the scarred landscape. These ARC can fly overhead, roll around on the ground, or leap extraordinary distances on four mechanical legs. Each is uniquely deadly.You are woefully inadequate in a battle against most of Arc Raiders’ enemies, which means you’ll need to scurry around to avoid them, throw noisemakers to distract them, or attack as a team, with either the squad you deployed alongside or other players you convince to join you over chat. All of this is in service of the game’s one true god: loot, which you need in order to perform everything from repairing your weapons to crafting medical supplies to training your pet rooster so he can fetch items for you on the surface. And you can only keep what you successfully escape with, so if you die mid-match or fail to get to an elevator or metro car before the timer runs out, it’s all gone.Though my first few rounds of Arc Raiders were supremely difficult and punishing (in my third match, I found several pieces of rare loot and was then ruthlessly murdered by a squad all clad in red), Embark has ensured that you can make progress fast. You can upgrade your raider’s mobility, stamina and stealthiness every time you level up, and you can earn experience through playing rounds and successfully extracting. You can recycle things into crafting materials to upgrade your weapons and shield, or sell trinkets to merchants for extra cash that will help you buy better equipment. Even after a bad round, you still getsomewhere.After every successful extraction, I want to jump right back in for more. I want more close calls, accidental explosions and terrifying sprints through ruined cities. I want to hurl more expletives over chat so that other squads know I’m in the thick of it, walk past another player blastingA Thousand Miles by Vanessa Carltonthrough their microphone, usher another half-dozen more people into an elevator hatch before I press the button to close the door at the last second.Arc Raiders isn’t just fun to play.

An automatic blind, which I can operate without getting out of bed, rises to reveal an ocean view: the dramatic storm-surging North Sea with great black-backed gulls circling nearby and a distant ship on the horizon. A watery gold sunrise lights the clouds and turbulent grey water.I’m the first person to sleep in the new Kraken lodge at Still Southwold, a former farm in Easton Bavents on the Suffolk coast. It’s a stylish wooden cabin, one of a scattering of holiday lets in an area prone to aggressive coastal erosion. The owner, Anne Jones, describes the challenges of living on a coast that is rapidly receding in the face of climate-exacerbated storms: the waves have eroded more than 40 hectares (100 acres), and the family business “is no longer a viable farm”. Instead, it is home to low-carbon cottages and cabins, “designed to be movable when the land they stand on is lost to the sea”. The latest projects include a sea-view sauna and a ‘dune hut’ on the beach for reflexology treatments “with the sea and waves as the backdrop”.Southwold area mapBy train, bus and on foot, I’m here for the beaches, marshes, heathland and villages. Arriving at sunset, Still Southwold feels wild and remote, with lapwings flapping through the twilight like huge bats, butSouthwold pieris just an easy 10-minute walk away. Heading to the bus stop next morning, I notice plumes of spray behind the beach huts. Waves are crashing over the concrete promenade near the pier. There’s a contrast between the brightly painted row of huts, with their candy stripes and stained-glass dolphins, and the heaving, uncontainable ocean behind them. It’s a worrying sign, as the path I’ve chosen today is only walkable at low tide. Erosion means the official coast path between Lowestoft and Southwold has been mostly rerouted inland and the soft cliff edges are perilous.View image in fullscreenKraken cabin at Still Southwold.Photograph: Big Fish Photography/Still SouthwoldA 20-minute bus ride from the end of Pier Avenue brings me to Kessingland, a village just south of Lowestoft. Heading for the coast, with supplies fromBushells Bakery, I soon reach Rider Haggard Lane. The author of King Solomon’s Mines, H Rider Haggard,spent several summers in a holiday home on the cliffs in Kessingland, where he was visited by his friend Rudyard Kipling. Haggard planted marram grass to stop the sea encroaching and, climbing down steps on to the beach, I find there’s still a wide marram-grass-covered band of shingle. The sandy cliffs include layers of clay and fossil traces of steppe mammoths, hippos and sabre-toothed cats.Benacre Broad is unexpectedly lovely. Woods and marshes surround a beautiful fragile lake, decked with salt-bleached tree trunks like a natural sculpture gardenAt the far end of the beach, near flood management works, a Natural England sign warns that the beach-walking route from here to Southwold is impassable near Easton Bavents. The owners of Still Southwold give visitors a code for a gate between their clifftop farm and Covehithe Beach. I press on, looking warily at the mess of washed-up kelp and driftwood that winter waves have hurled on to the land.A hardy hiker is heading the other way in shorts, with a battered rucksack. He’s one of only three people I meet all day, and I check the state of the beach ahead. Is it safe? Is it walkable? “There’s a storm surge,” says the hiker. “The tide’s been much higher than expected. The wind’s from the north and the North Sea’s wider at the top than the bottom – it’s like someone blowing on a teacup.” The image stays with me all day, intensified by the milky-brown colour of the water, as the giant-tea-cooling waves roll into the sandy shore.View image in fullscreenBenacre broad.Photograph: Matthew Murphy/AlamyBenacre Broad is unexpectedly lovely. A loop of woods and marshes surrounds a beautiful and fragile lake, cut off from the sea by a shifting bank of sand and shingle, decked with salt-bleached roots and tree trunks like a natural sculpture garden. The coast here has retreated more than 500 metres in the last couple of centuries, and salt water now often breaches the bird-rich lake. I eat my sandwich in the sheltered bird hide, listening for resident warblers in the reeds, but hear only the roar of the sea.The atmospheric ruins of a huge medieval church stand on the cliffs above Benacre.St Andrew’s, Covehitheis now just the tall 14th-century tower and a smaller thatched building, under decaying arches, with the old octagonal carved font inside. At the end of the lane from church to coast, a red warning sign says “Footpath Closed” where the old coastal path ends abruptly on the collapsed cliff edge.We head back along boardwalks by the Dunwich River, remembering the drowned town of Dunwich not far away under the waves, a kind of Suffolk AtlantisLater, the warm bar of theSwan in Southwoldis extra welcome after a chilly day on windswept beaches. There’s port-laced mulled wine on offer, as well as creamy Baron Bigod brie from the Fen Farm Dairy or slow-cookedBlythburgh porkwith apple.Next day, I meet friends in the scone-scentedBloomcafe on Southwold High Street and we stroll across Southwold Common to Walberswick. We’re following a section of the nightjar waymarks of theSandlings Walk, a long-distance hike through surviving fragments of heathland between Southwold and Ipswich. Since medieval times, 90% of what was once a continuous stretch of Suffolk heath has been lost.View image in fullscreenThe ferry across the Blyth.Photograph: AlamyThe last autumn colours are glowing across Walberswick Common, with its bracken and birch trees. We head back along boardwalks by the Dunwich River, remembering thedrowned town of Dunwichnot far away under the waves, a kind of Suffolk Atlantis. The wind has dropped today and the marsh is full of noises: the sudden trilling of a Cetti’s warbler and the rare song of a bearded tit from the miles of whispering reedbeds. We cross the Blyth estuary byrowing boat ferryfor lunch at the harboursideSole Bay Fish Company, before heading back towards Southwold as the sun sets.Accommodation was provided byStill Southwold(cabins from£617for three nights) and transport byGreater Anglia(singles from Norwich to Lowestoft£10.10, advancesingles from London to Lowestoftfrom £17).Explore more on these topicsSuffolk holidaysEngland holidaysShort breaksUnited Kingdom holidaysWalking holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Whether it’s a quick sandwich filling in times of chaos or an effortless party dip, I am addicted. My favourite way to serve it, though, is as part of a loaded crisp platter. Use salted or pickle crisps, and load them up with spoonfuls of pimento cheese, sliced pickles, herbs and heat. Move over nachos, there’s a new crisp platter in town.Pimento cheese and pickle loaded crispsIf you can get proper jarred pimentos, then by all means use them, but I find those cheese-stuffed bell peppers from the deli counter easier to find (and they work brilliantly).Prep25 minServes8-10125g mature cheddar, grated250g cream cheese100g mayonnaise120g cheese-stuffed bell peppers, drained and finely chopped¼ tsp garlic powder¼ tsp sweet smoked paprika, plus extra to serveSea salt andblack pepper½ bunchspring onions, trimmed and finely sliced250g ready salted crisps5 cornichons, finely sliced1 fresh green chilli, halved lengthways and finely sliced2 pickled green chillies(optional)2sprigsflat-leaf parsley, choppedIn a large bowl, mix the grated cheddar, cream cheese, mayonnaise, chopped bell peppers, garlic powder and paprika. Season well, add most of the spring onions and beat well to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning. (You can make the dip well in advance and store it in a covered container in the fridge until you’re ready to serve.)Spread out the crisps on a platter and spoon the pimento dip over the top. Sprinkle over the remaining sliced spring onions, all the sliced cornichons, the sliced green chilli, the whole pickled chillies, if using, and the chopped parsley. Sprinkle with a few pinches of paprika and serve.Explore more on these topicsFoodSnacksNew yearCheeseVegetablesAmerican food and drinkHerbs and spicesrecipesShareReuse this content"

After all the carolling, gifting and tree-ing (not to mention the eating and drinking) of the actual Christmassy bit, it feels almost cruel to have to do it all again, and on – in my opinion – one of the most stressful nights of the year: New Year’s Eve.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If you’re not paying over the odds and going out, with long queues and stressed-out staff, you’re the stressed-out one yourself. “Is everyone good for drinks?” “When was the last time anyone saw [insert child’s name here]?” And then there’s the clean glass matrix, where no one can remember whose is whose and you’re caught in an endless cycle of washing-up. The antidote to all of the above is, for me, just to stay in with your immediates and a bottle of something nice. Five guests maximum. I don’t like going into the New Year already tense – what hope will I have for 2026 if I’m going into it with high blood pressure and flat wine in a warm glass?Obviously, the done thing here is sparkling wine, and there are a few options out there. Champagne is the most obvious one. The sort you’ll find in the supermarket will have “NV” on the label, meaning it’s a blend of vintages, so the wine is classified “non-vintage”. Unless you’ve had a particularly liquid 2025, this is the sort of thing you’ll want if you’re planning on watering more than three people. If the champagne has a year on the label, meanwhile, it’s “vintage”: more expensive, yes, but also more expressive of a time and place for the producer.How about prosecco? If you’re already a fan, you’ll know exactly the one you want to drink. But if you don’t think prosecco’s for you, on account of its usual sweetness, I have a good work-around: to find a dry prosecco, look for bottles with “brut” or “extra brut” on the label, and perhaps you’ll find something more pleasurable.And this will be the last time this year I recommend lambrusco, from Emilia-Romagna, the most easily recognisable versions of which are a deep, inky pink with a candyfloss foam (I dida whole column on the stuffearlier this year). Try it with cured meat.This time last year, I went all inon recommending soju, a Korean drink distilled from rice and often fruit-flavoured, for a party. I still stand by that, not least because it’s designed to be shared between friends. No need to neck it, though, because it’s incredibly pleasant to sip. Or mix it with a light beer, such as rice beer or lager, to create a lightly flavoured carbonated drink. Currently, my favourites for this are peach and plum, but who knows what next year might bring?Four bottles to get your party off with a bangJinro plum soju£6 (350ml) Morrisons, 13%.
