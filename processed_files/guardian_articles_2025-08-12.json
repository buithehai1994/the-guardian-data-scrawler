Our writer takes the ‘stink tower’ tour of the capitalOliver WainwrightTue 12 Aug 2025 11.02 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 12.13 EDTShareAgroup of colossal black tombstones has landed on the north bank of the Thames in London, looking like mysterious monoliths from another civilisation. They stand near Blackfriars Bridge as imposing bookends, rising almost 10 metres, folded in places to form platforms and benches, slipping down in others to become one with the pavement. Water trickles from the summit of one huge slab, running down ridges and splashing into a sunken pool. Another pair rise straight out of the river wall, hoisting wooden fenders with them from the swirling brown waters below.“I wanted to make something that comes from nowhere,” says Scottish artist Nathan Coley, as he clamberson to one of his concrete blocks, which form part of the most prominent new public artwork in Britain’s capital, set to be unveiled next month. “They are chunky, abstract, brooding objects that don’t reference anyone or anything. They can be joyful, beautiful and brutal at the same time.”I was asked if I could make the sewer chimneys resemble trees, like they do with phone mastsColey is better known forhis big illuminated signs, but there may be a good reason he didn’t want his sculptures to reference their subject this time. His slabs are the most visible part of the Tideway project, London’s £4.6bn super sewer, built to prevent 18m tonnes of sewage overflowing into the river each year. These enigmatic structures are, in effect, memorials to the era of flushing fecal matter straight into the Thames. “The thing about the super sewer,” Coley says, “is that it’s all hidden. So no one knows where they’re spending all this money. I wanted to make something really exciting to celebrate it.”View image in fullscreen‘Chunky, abstract, brooding’ … one of Nathan Coley’s Stages on Bazalgette Embankment.Photograph: Chris HopkinsonThere has been much talk of Tideway’s spiralling budget and endless delays, itsquestionable usefulness, and itsboss’s pay. But little attention has been given to the fact that a consequence of this costly pipe is a series of new, truly public spaces on the river, for the first time in a generation.One of the seven spaces created as a happy byproduct of the sewer is the 250-metre long stretch where we’re standing: a broad granite expanse dotted with trees, benches and Coley’s black slabs.From Putney in the west to Deptford in the east, Tideway’s meandering 25km path has necessitated the construction of new bits of land, poking out into the Thames to connect the existing overflow sewers (or “lost rivers” to the romantically inclined) to the new tunnel below. Totalling more than three acres, the spaces vary in size according to the volume of waste that must be intercepted and sent whooshing on its way in a spiralling vortex down huge new drop shafts – all of which happens beneath the neatly paved plazas.“They are essentially giant manhole covers,” saysRoger Hawkins of Hawkins\\Brown, the architects responsible for the five central spaces, from Chelsea Embankment to Blackfriars, that together make up the size of Trafalgar Square. “In an ideal world for the engineers, they would be fenced-off compounds that they could easily access. But instead, Tideway decided to create new public spaces, in just the same way that the original embankments were given back to the public in return for the disruption that was caused.”BeforeJoseph Bazalgettebuilt the Victorian network of sewers in the 1860s, London met the Thames with a muddy, sewage-soaked foreshore. The construction of the sewers led to the creation of the embankments: great brick and stone feats of engineering that introduced stately, tree-lined riverside promenades for the first time. Stroll along Victoria Embankment today and you will find the original cast-iron benches held up by sphinxes and camels, lamp-posts supported byentwined dolphins, and ornate sewer ventilation chimneys, or “stink pipes”, in the form of stylised doric columns. So how do Tideway’s contemporary equivalents compare?View image in fullscreenSoftened edge … Chelsea Quay, which will become part-flooded during high tide.Photograph: Rob ParrishThe separation of architecture and engineering in the ensuing 160 years, along with the rise of bureaucratic procurement systems, has led to somewhat more fragmented results. “Tideway was a totally engineering-led project,” says a member of the team who has worked on it for the last decade. “When you’re sitting in meetings with a couple of hundred civil engineers, they see the architecture and landscape as a kind of fluff on top.”Accordingly, the results feel less tied together by a unifying Bazalgettian hand than pieced together by committees with catalogues – something one artist involved describes as “Screwfixation”. Service and inspection requirements mean the pavements have become hymns to the manhole cover, peppered with innumerable service hatches for sewer buggies, drones and probes. One site features 55 hatches in an area half the size of a tennis court. The spaces are not all yet fully complete and open, but they have the slight sense of engineering that has been tiled with a coating of architecture, and garnished with public art.View image in fullscreenSuper structure … a civil engineer inside the concrete tunnel, during construction of the Tideway project.Photograph: Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty ImagesStill, there are some striking flourishes. One of the most consistent, recognisable elements, which help give the project a kind of site-wide identity, are the distinctiveblack cast-iron ventilation shafts. These modern-day stink pipes look like the funnels of submerged ships, twisting and flaring out as they rise to five metres, their form mimicking the path of the plummeting sewage vortex.“At one point, I was asked if I could make them look like trees, in the way they disguise mobile phone masts,” says Clare Donnelly, Tideway’s lead architect at Fereday Pollard, the firm in charge of coordinating the foreshore structures. “You don’t want to scream ‘sewer pipe’ at people, but we wanted them to be confident features in the landscape, not trying to hide.” Softening their heft, the funnels are inscribed withgnomic lines of poetry by Dorothea Smartt, alluding to the various lost rivers being intercepted below the pavement. “The furious Fleet flows red with Roman blood,” declares a chimney at Blackfriars. “Boudica battles bravely.”There are other contextual nods. At Chelsea, in front of the Royal hospital, the brick river wall has been extended out in a sinuous sweep to form a swelling, brick-paved space defined by stepped seating, incorporating colourful stripes ofglazed bricks by artist Florian Roithmayr. You enter through a gap in Bazalgette’s original river wall, which has been radically sliced open, with the cut granite left pleasingly raw.View image in fullscreenRow your boat … a sculpture marks the start point of the boat race at the new Putney Embankment.Photograph: Stewart Turkington“We were thinking about the alluvial geology of the river,” says Marko Neskovic, partner at Hawkins\\Brown, “imagining the beach popping up and allowing you to walk on it, as if it was an eroding island.” The wall rises from the river in banded strata, stepping back as it climbs to form little planted intertidal terraces, with grooves for aquatic life to shelter. A tempting staircase leads down to the water, although it is sadly fenced off. The architects had hoped they could provide access to the beach for mudlarkers, but the Port of London authority (controller of the Thames) vetoed the idea on safety grounds. Officially, the steps are therefore an escape route, rather than an access point.Despite the guidance to treat the river as foe, the architects have tried where they can to soften the relationship with the water. Most of the spaces slope subtly up towards the flood defence line, so you can see the Thames more easily rather than it being blocked behind the river wall. A foot-wetting frisson can also be had thanks to the incorporation of “floodable terraces”, which get splashed when big boats pass at high tide. Elsewhere, great iron mooring rings, grasped between lions’ teeth, are now surreally marooned inland, giving you a sense of transgressing beyond the river wall.View image in fullscreen‘A workingman’s cushion’ … Richard Wentworth’s cast bronze sandbag.Photograph: Courtesy the artistWhile Chelsea opts for organic curving brick, the space at Victoria Embankment,known as Tyburn Quay, is a more sober granite plaza raised on a square plinth, reflecting the formal surrounds of Westminster. A faintly Miesian pavilion will house kiosks for a cafe and loos, its stone walls inscribed with the profile of Bazalgette’s sewer, while an inlaid ring of bronze in the ground marks the location of the gigantic drop shaft below the paving. “We tried to incorporate lots of things you could enjoy if you were a river buff,” says Hawkins\\Brown’s Fiona Stewart. “Like using ductile iron in the paving at Blackfriars, to reference the iron deposits at the source of the Fleet.” Budding psychogeographers will rejoice.The artist commissions bring further intrigue, from a forthcoming flotilla of trading vessels byHew Locke in Tower Hamlets, to playful plinths byStudio Weave in Deptford, to Claire Barclay’s cast bronze oar balustrades in Putney,marking the starting point of the University Boat Race. Tyburn Quay’s grey granite decorum has been cheekily disrupted by Richard Wentworth, who has installed a series ofcast bronze sandbags, which droop in haphazard piles over the stone steps, alluding to makeshift flood defences. “It’s a workingman’s cushion,” says Wentworth, who has long celebrated the national culture of make-do-and-mend. “I hope the sandbags will get shiny where people sit on them. And they’re a little bit erotic. You can feel that someone might propose here.”His saucy sacks are under wraps until the space opens later this year, but the texture of the hessian has been meticulously recreated in bronze by the Lockbund sculpture foundry in Oxfordshire, which is also producing his bronze benches for Albert Embankment, near the MI6 headquarters. In an allusion to the Vauxhall origins of sanitaryware manufacturer Royal Doulton, Wentworth has designed seatingin the form of conjoined loos. “I think there’s something nice about sitting on the toilet with lots of other people,” he says. “It reminds you that pooing is public.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureThames WaterPublic services policyEngineeringPublic landsInfrastructurefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Just as the Gaza journalistic community thought matters could not get any worse, Benjamin Netanyahu’s brutal occupying forces carried out yet another cold-blooded murder on Sunday, this time of the Al Jazeera journalistsAnas al-Sharifand Mohammed Qraiqea, along with videographers Ibrahim Thaher, Mohammed Nofal and their colleagues. They were sheltering in a media tent near al-Shifa hospital, and were killed by a direct strike.The Israeli war machine, accelerating its stated goal of occupying Gaza, showed no restraint in targeting journalists, in violation of international conventions. So far in this warit has killed 238of us. The war on Gaza has become the deadliest conflict for journalists and media workers in living memory, with2024 recording the highest numberof journalists killed, the vast majority at the hands of Israeli forces. The systematic targeting and elimination of journalists is not merely a local or regional tragedy; it is a catastrophic breach of international norms regarding the protection of journalists in conflict zones, signalling a global collapse of the moral responsibility in safeguarding those who risk everything to shed light on the realities of war.Gaza is not the only place where journalists are under siege. Threats, intimidation and murderous violence against journalists are on the rise. However, what differentiates Israeli crimes is the impunity with which the occupation forces murder journalists and the indifference shown by leaders of the so-called free world. What is especially shocking is when some media organisations repeat the Israeli regime’s false allegations against targeted journalists without verification.By any measure, it is the most dangerous time to be a journalist in recent history. Reporters are threatened, harassed and killed merely for fulfilling their public duty of bearing witness and reporting the truth. Worldwide, the dangers faced by journalists in conflict zones have intensified. In 2023, a journalist or media worker was killed, on average, every four days. In 2024, this grim statistic worsened to onceevery three days, most of those by Israeli forces. The journalists in Gaza are not parachuted-in international correspondents but local journalists – those who know the land, the people and the stories best. These journalists are not just reporting on Gaza’s tragedy; they are living it.This surge in violence against journalists is neither accidental nor isolated. It is part of a broader, deeply worrying trend: the systematic silencing of the media, often orchestrated by autocrats and regimes who seek to conceal their crimes in darkness. This should horrify us all. It is an assault not only on individual reporters but on the entire global public’s right to know, to understand the depth of human suffering, and to hold the powerful to account.1:22Al Jazeera's Anas al-Sharif among five journalists killed by Israel in Gaza – videoBeyond the killings of more than 230 journalists, Israel now employs starvation as a tool, with journalists pushed to the brink, collapsing from hunger while reporting. AtAl Jazeera, we have lost colleagues and their family members in Gaza, with the latest killing of Anas al-Sharif and his colleagues bringing the total number of the network’s journalists killed to nine. Our colleagues have been forced to report not just on the atrocities happening to civilians, but on the direct attacks against those whose only weapon is a microphone or a camera.Despite this, we insist on continuing in our professional duty. We remain committed to reporting unfolding genocide, despite Israeli efforts to blind us and the world. We will tirelessly work to strengthen the teams and to remain faithful to our global audience, who have a right to be informed. But this requires international solidarity, and the exertion of full pressure on Israel to stop targeting and killing journalists and to allow international media access and freedom of operation in theGazaStrip.The international community must act, urgently and decisively, to safeguard journalists and to protect those who risk everything to inform the world about the continuing humanitarian catastrophe and genocide in Gaza. Journalists must be allowed to perform their duties without fear of violence. Anything less is a betrayal of the most fundamental principles of free expression.‘If these words reach you … Israel has succeeded in killing me’: the last words of a journalist killed in GazaRead moreWe owe it to the courageous journalists in Gaza to amplify their voices. Their work is not merely documentation; it is the first draft of history, whereby future historians will study the horrors of the 21st century’s most televised genocide. Access to reliable information about wars and conflicts is not a luxury; it is essential for the wellbeing of global populations, the protection of human rights and the global effort to hold perpetrators of war crimes accountable. When journalists are silenced, we all become more vulnerable to disinformation, propaganda and the unchecked abuse of power.We are at a crossroads. If the world continues to tolerate the murder, starvation and persecution of journalists, it is not only journalism that will suffer, but also accountability, democracy and the possibility of a more just future. The international legal framework for the protection of journalists in war must be urgently strengthened and enforced, and governments must be held to account for violations.The international journalistic community, and indeed the world, bears an immense responsibility. The courage, commitment and sacrifice of journalists in Gaza demand nothing less than our full support and unrelenting advocacy. Our inaction will be recorded by history as a monumental failure to protect those who stood at the frontlines of truth.Asef Hamidi is the director of news, Al Jazeera ChannelDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The bleak, bleak suffering. Katherine Kelly’s desperate drug-smuggling thriller – featuring distressing scenes set in a Bulgarian prison – is so claustrophobic it’s suffocatingLucy ManganTue 12 Aug 2025 11.18 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 12.13 EDTShareIwonder, sometimes, if Katherine Kelly misses her days as Becky McDonald in Coronation Street. Yes, Becky was a once-homeless, thieving ex-con who worked her way through the full panoply of soap storylines (abuse, miscarriage, drink problem, buying a child, marrying Steve, smashing up Tracy Barlow’s front room with a sledgehammer, a stint in the Rovers Return) before her departure from the cobbled streets for a new life in Barbados after a triumphant wedding-reception-wrecking, but, y’know, she got to have a laugh while she was doing it.This was during the early 00s, when Coronation Street still dealt in comedy as well as tragedy, recognising them as two sides of the same life coin, especially among the barmaids – fully formed or embryonic battleaxes all – gazing out on the world and its punters as they wearily pulled pints behind the bar.Since then, Kelly’s output has largely been one of unrelenting grimness. I can’t remember the last time she took a main role in anything that required a lightness of touch, let alone the exercise of her comic chops. And never more so than in her latest outing, the exhausting six-part thriller In Flight, in which she plays a desperate single mother, Joanne, whose son, Sonny, is sentenced to 15 years in a Bulgarian prison for a murder he swears he did not commit. Oh God, the suffering! The bleak, bleak suffering!Joanne sits opposite her boy as he cries and gibbers at the thought of spending years – if he is not shanked by breakfast time – in the terrifying hellhole run by thugs (it is safe to say that the Bulgarian tourist board will not be happy with In Flight). She goes home and trawls through his case files again, in preparation for a hearing that promises to be just as unsuccessful as all the others.It is almost a relief when the thriller proper begins; give me raw suspense over emotional battery any day. Joanne, a long-haul flight attendant, is approached by a menacing man called Cormac (Stuart Martin) and presented with a non-opportunity: start smuggling drugs for the cartel he represents and get her son protected in prison – albeit at the risk of life imprisonment or the death penalty herself, depending on whether she gets caught and in which country – or refuse and get him killed. Cormac hands her a suitcase with a false bottom, tips on how to disguise the smell of the heroin she is told to pick up in Istanbul, and vanishes into the night after warning her not to tell anyone.She tells Dominic (Ashley Thomas). He is a customs officer and they had a thing while he was separated from his wife. He is now back with his wife and trying to make a go of things, but he and Joanne still gaze at each other yearningly across the baggage carousel.Thus the stage is set for – well, hours of ordinary people being terrorised into acts of increasingly inventive desperation, really. There are lots of set pieces ratcheting up the tension as Joanne is nearly caught in the act again and again and kilos of drugs have to be hidden in tampon dispensers.Ambiguous conversations are held and more and moren trusted folk turn out to be corrupt horrors; you would simply give anything to make it stop. Partly so Joanne and Sonny’s anguish can end, partly so yours can.I don’t know if this counts as a successful thriller or not. Clearly, it works to the extent that the viewer is invested enough to be discomfited along with the characters. Equally clearly, the choking airlessness of it all is … not entertaining, especially with a script that dispenses necessary information in as unadorned a manner as possible.But I am a coward when it comes to the drug-smuggling thriller format. I feel as if I am being forced to watch a dog chew off its own leg to escape from a trap. But for those who love precisely that about it, In Flight will be a classic of the genre: the claustrophobic nature of it all, the endangerment of hapless innocents and the reminder of the evil that spreads untrammelled across space and history are a cluster of superb selling points. It’s brisk, it’s well made, it’s entirely harrowing. I wish you your strange, strange joy of it.In Flight airs on Channel 4 and is available online nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what to knowTell us: share your experiences of traveling with friendsMadeleine AggelerTue 12 Aug 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 12.02 EDTShareColorectal cancer is the third-most diagnosed cancer and third leading cause of cancer deaths in the US, according to theCancer Research Institute. It is also the third-most common cancer in the UK, andaccountedfor 12.6% of new cancer cases in the country in 2021.Rates of the disease have dropped overall in recent decades, but in those under 50, rates have increased significantly.“Individuals born in the 1980s are about twice as likely to get colorectal cancer as those born in the 1960s, and individuals born in the 1990s are about three times as likely,” says Dr Zachariah Foda, assistant professor of medicine and oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.Experts don’t know the reasons behind this increase, but medical guidelines have shifted to address it. In 2021, the recommended age to start colorectal cancer screening in the US – either by colonoscopy or at-home testing – wasloweredfrom 50 to 45. In the UK, screening iscurrentlyoffered starting at age 52, and will soon be offered to those aged 50.When do you know when it’s time to stop cancer treatment? She knew – her final act of controlRead moreColorectal cancer is preventable and “highly treatable” if detected early, according to theNational Cancer Institute. Butfewerthan 20% of those aged 45 to 49 are keeping up with screenings,comparedwith 72% of those aged 50 to 75. Experts say some people don’t know they should be getting screened, and others are nervous about what colonoscopies entail.Here’s what you need to know about colonoscopies and colorectal cancer screening.What is a colonoscopy?“A colonoscopy is an endoscopic procedure, meaning we use a camera at the end of a long tube to examine the colon and rectum,” explains Foda. The colon itself is about 70cm long, he says.Patients are first put under sedation or anesthesia. Doctors then insert the scope into their rectum, and examine the lining of the colon for any abnormalities, like masses or small bumps called polyps. These polyps are usually removed during the procedure.“The closest analogy is, you have a mole on your skin and it’s growing or discolored, and doctors remove it,” says Michael Sapienza, CEO of the ColorectalCancerAlliance, a colorectal cancer advocacy group in the US.If a mass is too big to remove during the colonoscopy, the doctor will take a sample to biopsy and test for cancer.A colonoscopy is an outpatient procedure, meaning you can go home the same day. The procedure itself usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes, but with pre- and post-procedure care, the whole process can last two to three hours, says Dr Andres Carrion, a gastroenterologist at GastroMed Miami.One of the most common concerns about colonoscopies is that they are painful, says Carrion. But “intravenous sedatives make the procedure easy, and there is no pain or discomfort”, he explains.How do you prepare for a colonoscopy?Colonoscopy preparation starts about a week before the procedure. Patients are instructed to eat a “low residue” diet for that week, which means avoiding foods that can make it difficult for doctors to get a good look at the lining of the colon.“These are things that the body takes a while to get rid of, like seeds, nuts, leafy greens and high fiber things,” says Foda.The day before the procedure, patients are restricted to a clear liquid diet – no solid foods. And the night before, they take laxatives to fully clear the colon. This can result in spending quite a bit of time on the toilet.“Hopefully you have some good reading or a movie you can watch on your phone,” says Sapienza.What are the risks of a colonoscopy?Colonoscopies are generally extremely safe, but as with any medical procedure, there are risks.According to theCleveland Clinic, these include an adverse reaction to the sedative or anaesthetic used, dehydration from the preparation process, slight bleeding after a polyp is removed or mass biopsied, some abdominal pain, infection and a perforated bowel.This last risk is serious, but rare. Onereviewfound that there were four bowel perforations for every 10,000 colonoscopies performed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Depending on a person’s health and medical history, doctors may decide that colonoscopies could do more harm than good.For those with a first-degree family member – meaning a parent, sibling or child – diagnosed with colorectal cancer, Carrion says screening should start 10 years before the age at which your relative was diagnosed. For example, if your mother was diagnosed with colon cancer when she was 45, you should start getting screened at 35.Certain medical histories also put individuals at a higher risk for colorectal cancer, says Foda. This includes those who have previously had cancer and have received chemotherapy, those with inflammatory bowel disease, as well as those with Lynch syndrome (a condition that increases an individual’s risk for many kinds of cancer) and polyposis (a condition characterized by a large number of polyps in the colon).Are there other methods of colorectal cancer screening?Colonoscopies are not the only way to screen for colorectal cancer. For those at an average risk of the disease, there are also non-invasive at-home tests like Cologuard and the fecal immunochemical test (FIT), says Sapienza.For both tests, a patient will receive the necessary testing material in the mail or from a doctor. They will then have tomail in a personal fecal sample. The FIT analyzes whether there is blood in the stool. The Cologuard test looks for both blood in the stool and abnormal DNA that could point to polyps or masses in the colon.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, 'Well Actually', then 'Read more on living a good life in a complex world,' then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say 'More from this section'How often should you be screened for colorectal cancer?The frequency for each person depends on a number of factors including the type of test performed and medical history.If a colonoscopy is completely clear, you can usually wait 10 years before your next procedure, says Sapienza, but check with your doctor.Current guidance recommends that FIT tests be repeated every year, and Cologuard every three years, says Sapienza. If the test is negative, no further analysis is required. If either test comes back positive, you will have to have a colonoscopy. This does not mean the at-home tests are not effective at detecting the disease alone, says Foda. “They should be viewed as part of the gold standard for colorectal cancer screening.”What are the symptoms of colorectal cancer?In addition to regular screenings, be familiar with possible symptoms of colorectal cancer, says Sapienza. This is especially important for those under 45, who might not be eligible yet for screenings.These symptoms include blood in the stool, especially dark blood; a change in bowel habits; anemia; involuntary weight loss; and/or ongoing stomach discomfort.If you start to present with any of these symptoms, talk to your primary care doctor or gastroenterologist, and ask for a colonoscopy, he says.“We need to make sure that people are aware of these symptoms,” says Sapienza. “This is a disease where screening saves lives.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyCancerHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You can rebuild a house …”One of his parents’ neighbours had been luckier. The flames had stopped at the perimeter of his house, cremating shrubs and blackening the wire fence but leaving his home remarkably intact.As the owner went around dousing the still-hot earth with a hose, his father explained what had happened.View image in fullscreenHomes affected by the fire in Soto de Viñuelas.Photograph: ZIPI/EPA“My son just grabbed his dog when it happened and put it in the car and then went to pick up the neighbours and get out,” he said. “I thought the whole house would have burned but it’s just the perimeter.”The big worry now, he added, was making sure there was enough water: “They say it’s going to be hot and windy this afternoon and the wind could relight the embers under the ash and start the fire again.”As planes flew through the grey skies high above a nearby British private school that had had a similarly miraculous escape, a local couple paid tribute to the 55-year-old Romanian man who had died when the fire reached the stables.“He died trying to save horses in the stables, where 26 horses burned to death,” said José Luis Ramírez, a telecoms engineer who lives up the road.“He was really great and he worked so hard,” said Ramírez’s wife, Brenda. The dead man, who has yet to be named, suffered burns to 98% of his body and died after being flown to hospital by helicopter.By 1pm, the residents of Soto and Tres Cantos who had spent the night on mattresses in a local leisure centre had packed up and headed home to inspect the aftermath of the blaze.View image in fullscreenAuthorities ordered the evacuation of 180 people.Photograph: ZIPI/EPAJesús Moreno García, the mayor of Tres Cantos, said firefighters had told him they had never seen a blaze like it. “It spread so quickly because of the strong winds,”he told local TV. “We’ve been through something really shocking.”The air of unreality and the stink of smoke were compounded by the lingering presence of the many fire engines and vehicles from the military emergencies unit that had helped save the well-heeled neighbourhoods.“It was all just like a dream and today we’re just checking on the damage,” said Ramírez as he and his wife walked down the road between blackened hills.Some houses in Soto were evidently beyond saving. The roof of one had collapsed to reveal the still-smoking floor plan beneath.The garden had fared better: despite the ash-grey pool, the skeleton of a trampoline and the piles of soot and twisted, dead shrubs, a hammock still hung between two untouched pine trees.Around the corner, Adolfo López’s mother came out of her ruined house, said good afternoon and shook her head.“Esto es lo que hay,” she said.

If Zelenskyy is a worried man, who can blame him?Tue 12 Aug 2025 07.52 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareGood to have it confirmed that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will be talking about Ukraine behind its back on Friday in Alaska, as the US president rambled through a press conference on Monday in which he explained that Putin “wasn’t going to mess with me” and that Ukraine was going to have to accept new borders. And listen – you’ll agree that territorial pronouncements mean so much more coming from a guy whose staff once shamelesslyredrew a hurricane impact mapto stop him looking stoopid. It’s a true honour for the Ukrainians to see their country effectively carved up by someone who would prefer to post-rationalise any old crap with a Sharpie than admit he doesn’t have the first clue about it and cares even less.Leave it to the tasteful visionarybehind the Gaza Rivierato categorise what he’s doing as trying to get back some of Ukraine’s “oceanfront property”. “In real estate we call it oceanfront property,” Trump said on Monday, demystifying this term of high art for non-developers who haven’t contrived to bankrupt several Atlantic City casinos. “That’s always the most valuable property.” Thanks, Mister Mogul! It is assumed that the stretch of high-end primo coastline Trump was referring to included Mariupol, the utterly ruined port in which many thousands of civilians perished during the Russian siege. In international law we call it a possible war crime; in real estate we call it … what? Strategic pre-construction? Spa-chitecture?Certainly, how we put things is a matter of concern to this supremely sensitive president, who can find words very hurty, particularly when allied to optional concepts such as truth or the law. “I was a little bothered by the fact Zelenskyy was saying, ‘I have to get constitutional approval,’” he whined on Monday of the Ukrainian leader’s desire to put any peace deal to the Ukrainian people via a referendum. “He’s got approval to go into war and kill everybody?” Again, whetherUkraine“go[ing] into war” is a fair categorisation of its being invaded by Russia is not something that bothers the Sharpie king of the White House.As for the precise nature of the forthcoming cartography, Trump spent quite a lot of time talking suspiciously nebulously about “land swapping”. Can you swap things on behalf of someone who doesn’t want to swap them, and without them being present at the table? If so, I would like someone to swap me one of Trump’s second-tier golf courses, and would expect him to be very relaxed about it. He’ll just have to take my word that it’s in the wider interests of everybody.In terms of what he deems to be the interests of interested parties, there has been some strong suggestion in recent days that the Trump administration thinks it would be a win for Ukraine to abandon the bits of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that are not even occupied by Russia, with only a ceasefire and the promise of some future better deal to show for it. Which would certainly be the absolute wrongest reading of a land deal since the New York Tribunecalled the Alaska purchasea folly and a waste of money.In fact, it would explain Putin’s willingness to travel to that very territory to hold Friday’s peace talks instead of doing it on neutral turf – you can probably afford to concede on the meeting location if everything else is likely to be such a complete gift to you. The Russian president might even bring along anotherhideously flattering portraitof Trump as an ice-breaking present, having already commissioned one as a personal gift earlier this year, which was passed on to Trump via his special envoy Steve Witkoff. Witkoff said it was a “beautiful portrait” and that the president was “clearly touched by it”.And so to the buildup to Friday. We’ll have to see how excited Trump gets about the chance to join some sort of German-organised conference call with European leaders on Wednesday. For the US president, the negotiating table is a place that seats only two people, one of which should always be him. For Putin, many fear through bitter experience, the negotiating table is a place where you simply obfuscate and buy time to regroup before renewing aggression. Rather like Holly Golightly at the window of Tiffany’s, nothing very bad can happen to Putin in Alaska. Merely turning up avoids the threatened sanctions. If, as seems likely, Trump decides he should be appeased with some land, any Ukrainian refusal to rubber-stamp this would leave him frustrated with and lashing out at Zelenskyy, not Putin. (Give the orange guy his peace deal and then his peace prize, dammit! He’s getting bored out here.) And if a ceasefire is somehow agreed, it would surely, on the form book, be regarded by Putin merely as a strategic buying of time. The Russian leader is obsessed with Ukraine in a way the Trump administration seems incapable of, or indifferent to, grasping.Look, maybe geopolitics really will turn out to be just a simpler version of commercial real estate. Maybe someone who has lost almost as many fortunes as he has gained in that particular trade really will turn out to be a maverick master whose refresh-the-parts traditional diplomacy can’t reach. Maybe! But the sheer lack of jeopardy for Putin in Alaska feels far more significant than the mood music. The best-case scenario is that Europe and Ukraine prepare themselves for the artlessness of the deal. The worst-case scenario is a darker pathway altogether – and one we seem increasingly likely to stumble on to.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionVladimir PutinRussiaUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

This includes examining the possibility of a cap on lifetime gifting.At present, gifts made seven years before someone dies are not subject to IHT, while those given three to seven years before death are taxed on a sliding scale known as “taper relief”, with the rate reducing each year from 32% to 8%.A lifetime cap could be introduced to limit the amount of money or value of assets an individual can donate as part of their IHT planning and the Treasury is also reviewing rules around the taper rate, people familiar with the matter said.A source with knowledge of the work told the Guardian: “With so much wealth stored in assets like houses that have shot up in value, we have to find ways to better tap into the inheritances of those who can afford to contribute more.“It’s hard to make sure these taxes don’t end up with loopholes that undermine their purpose. But we are trying to work out what revenue might be raised and how to ensure it’s a fair approach.”The source added: “IHT can raise more, and even if we do nothing, it will raise more money as the threshold for paying it stays frozen. But we have to look at the levers for taxing wealth if the aim of the government is to avoid hitting earnings from work as much as possible.”IHT changes have provoked a strong public response in the past, even though fewer than one in 20 estates paid it in recent years.In the late 2000s the Conservatives enjoyed a significant swing in opinion polls when they proposed raising the threshold at which IHT would kick in. As party leader David Cameron made it a hot-button issue,putting pressure on the Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, with headlines about the “death tax”.Reeves hasfaced fierce criticismandprotestsover the past year in response to her decision in last autumn’s budget to cut tax breaks for farmers passing on their businesses.She defended her decision on Tuesday in an interview in Northern Ireland, saying she believed that those farmers with more than £3m to pass on “should make a contribution” and that they would still continue to pay a lower rate of IHT than others.Only 4.6% of deaths resulted in IHT being paid in the tax year 2022-23, according to thelatest figuresfrom HMRC. The average effective tax rate was 13%, after accounting for all the different reliefs and exemptions that might apply depending on the individual circumstances. That compares with the headline rate of 40%.The government is trying to work out how it can tap into the vast wave ofwealth that will be transferred from baby boomers when they die, fuelled by large pension pots, as well as house prices that have risen sharply over their lifetimes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From April 2027, most unused pension pots and death benefits will be subject to the tax. This leaves large loopholes, however, if sums are withdrawn and gifted instead, and officials are increasingly concerned about large cash sums being extracted from these pots.Another possible revenue stream being looked at is whether to increase capital gains tax rates by a few percentage points.However, this would be accompanied by some kind of CGT allowance for investors who put money into British businesses, as the Treasury tries to strike a balance between tapping into wealth to fund public services without deterring investment into the UK.There is growing anecdotal evidence thatsome wealthy people and company directors may have already left the UKfollowing recent tax changes, includingthe end of the “non-dom” status, though no official data is yet available.The Guardianwas first to revealthat the government was considering major changes to business property relief and agricultural land tax in 2024, a step later brought in by Reeves. These changes may have a significant impact on how much money is raised by IHT, but it is unclear how they might alter behaviour.In 2024 CGT rates were not raised as high as many senior Labour party figures had hoped, with the government stepping back from bringing the levy closer to levels of income tax.Still, some senior government figures believe that there is a political deal to be done to create a path towards equalising its levels with income tax. They believe there is room for a compromise after Reeves signalled that a flat-rate wealth tax – of the kindproposed by backbenchers last month, of 2% on assets over £10m – had more or less been ruled out.In a recent interview, Reeves pointed to IHT and CGT as the UK alternatives to a headline wealth tax such as that in countries like Switzerland.“We have inheritance tax. We have capital gains. We’ve just got rid of the non-dom tax status that doesn’t exist any more in our tax system. So we do have taxes that tax the wealthy,” she told LBC’s Iain Dale on 2 August. “I’m not keen to do what Switzerland has done and replace those with a wealth tax because I think there’s the risk of actually losing money by doing those things.”A Treasury spokesperson said: “As set out in the plan for change, the best way to strengthen public finances is by growing the economy – which is our focus. Changes to tax and spend policy are not the only ways of doing this, as seen with our planning reforms, which are expected to grow the economy by £6.8bn and cut borrowing by £3.4bn.“We are committed to keeping taxes for working people as low as possible, which is why at last autumn’s budget we protected working people’s payslips and kept our promise not to raise the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance or VAT.”Explore more on these topicsBudgetInheritance taxTaxTax and spendingBudget deficitRachel ReevesEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Zelenskyy also warned that Russia was planning new offensives on three parts of the frontline.Speaking to journalists in the run-up to the Trump-Putin summit, and a day before a virtual meeting with US and European leaders, Zelenskyy said he believed Putin wanted to dominate his country because he “does not want a sovereign Ukraine”.It was therefore dangerous, Zelenskyy said, for Ukraine to be forced by the US into accepting Russia’s demand to take over the parts of Donbas it does not control after the Alaska summit. The region sought by Russia amounted to “about 90,000 square kilometres” of the country, he said.EU leaders defend Ukraine’s freedom to decide future ahead of Trump-Putin summitRead moreLast week Russia indicated it was prepared to consider a ceasefire in the Ukraine war for the first time, in exchange for Ukraine withdrawing from the parts of Donbas it still controlled. Though Trump then suggested that Russia and Ukraine could engage in some “swapping of territories”, Zelenskyy said he understood that Russia was “simply offering not to advance further, not to withdraw from anywhere” and that swaps were not on the table.Map“We will not leave Donbas. We cannot do it,” Zelenskyy said. “For Russians, Donbas is a springboard for a future new offensive.” The region demanded by Russia was too strategically important to give up, he said, because it was a heavily fortified area that protected Ukraine’s central cities.“I have heard nothing – not a single proposal – that would guarantee that a new war will not start tomorrow and that Putin will not try to occupy at least Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv” once Russia had gained all of Donbas, Zelenskyy said.Ukraine’s leader said he wanted Putin instead to agree to a ceasefire on the current frontlines and for both sides to return all prisoners of war and missing children, before any discussion about territory and the future security of the country. “Any question of territory cannot be separated from security guarantees,” he said.Zelenskyy said he would not be at the summit in Alaska, the first face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin with both in office since 2018. But he said he hoped it would be followed by “a trilateral meeting” with Trump and Putin, though the Russian leader has so far said he is not willing to meet Zelenskyy.The Ukrainian leader also expressed faith in the unpredictable Trump, who he said could act as an honest broker between himself and Putin. “I do not believe that Putin’s proposal is Trump’s proposal,” he said. “I believe that Trump represents the United States of America. He is acting as a mediator – he is in the middle, not on Russia’s side. Let him not be on our side but in the middle.”He said he did not know what exactly Putin and Trump were going to discuss in Alaska, saying “probably there is a bilateral track” of talks about other topics of mutual interest, such as trade, sanctions and business. But he said Putin had scored a diplomatic win in securing the meeting: “He is seeking, excuse me, photographs. He needs a photo of his meeting with President Trump.”Zelenskyy said Russia was desperately trying to show it was winning the war and that the Kremlin wanted “to create a certain narrative, especially in the American media, that Russia is moving forward and Ukraine is losing” by mounting sabotage attacks in the Donbas region.He acknowledged that “groups of Russians advanced about 10 kilometres in several places” although he said: “They have no equipment, only weapons in their hands,” and said that some had already been killed or captured.But the breach is ill-timed from Ukraine’s point of view. In Alaska, Putin is likely to tell Trump that such successes show that Russia is gradually winning the three-year war in the east, and so US future support for Kyiv will be wasted.Map showing Russian advancesWar maps showed two lines of advance east of the town of Dobropillya, and gains of about six miles since Friday. Experts said the next few days would be critical to see if Ukraine could contain the break in the front.Ukraine’s military said Russia had concentrated about 110,000 troops in the sector and that the invaders were “brazenly attempting to infiltrate our defensive lines with sabotage and small infantry groups, regardless of their losses”.The military command said in a social media post that reserves had been deployed at the order of Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine’s chief military commander, in an effort to restore the frontlines.View image in fullscreenResidents of Drobopillya and nearby villages are  evacuated on Tuesday.Photograph: Pierre Crom/Getty ImagesThe Institute for the Study of War said Russian “sabotage and reconnaissance groups” had infiltrated Ukrainian-held territory near Dobropillya, a key supply point in the west of the Donetsk region.“It is premature to call the Russian advances in the Dobropillya area an operational-level breakthrough,” the ISW said on Monday night. It said the invaders would now try to turn “tactical advances” into something more significant.Russia is taking heavy casualties of about 1,000 a day, with 500 killed and 500 wounded on Monday, Zelenskyy said, as it relies heavily on infantry assaults to break Kyiv’s defensive lines.Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s casualties on the same day were much smaller – a total of 340 – “18 killed and 243 wounded, with 79 missing in action”. But in the past when Moscow’s forces have broken through, Ukraine has frequently proved unable to push them back.A former senior Ukrainian army officer, Bohdan Krotevych, said the piercing of Ukraine’s lines had come about because “instead of reinforcing defensive units with infantry”, senior commanders in Kyiv had prioritised deploying newly mobilised soldiers into assault forces, leaving units already on the frontline weakened.“To stabilise the front, we must reinforce brigades on the line of contact with infantry,” Krotevych said, and he called for Ukraine to urgently strengthen its reserve forces and adopt a defensive strategy rather than try to counter high-risk Russian infantry assaults with its own.Dobropillya is a key supply point for the beleaguered towns of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad to the south and the principal cities of Ukrainian-held Donbas to the east from the centre of the country.Zelenskyy said Russia was preparing a fresh offensive in the autumn involving nearly 30,000 troops moved from Sumy, in the north-east of Ukraine, “in three directions” on the frontline – towards Zaporizhzhia in the south and Pokrovsk and the nearby Novopavlika in the south-east.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

More than 200 residents have supposedly signed up to Safeguard Force, which claims it will carry out uniformed patrols in the seaside town to protect “women, children and the elderly”.Begum said this type of behaviour had been triggered by a “breakdown of the social contract” and a failure of politicians to deal with economic deprivation.“We know that vigilantism is not regulated, it’s not rational, it is an emotional reaction to a situation where people are feeling desperate and are feeling let down and are feeling angry,” she said.“And this has implications for all people of colour in this country, because people are not checking people’s migrant status or whether they are seeking asylum before they make their conclusions about whether they belong, whether they are going to be subject to hostility and aggression.”In an effort to placate some concerns about crime, the Home Office announced on Wednesday it was rolling out 10 new live facial recognition vans to seven police forces across the country to locate wanted criminals.It also said every neighbourhood across England and Wales will have a named, contactable officer, with dedicated antisocial behaviour leads and new visible patrols in town centres.Begum said incidents of people being mistaken for migrants were not “innocent mistakes” but happened as a result of politicians and the media pursuing an agenda based on “flimsy or false information”.“For instance, Rupert Lowe has an agenda, he has a particular position on these things … there are thresholds of accountability and scrutiny and checking that he should have gone through,” she said.“I do think there’s a deliberate disingenuousness around this, because it’s convenient and easy to focus on migrants and stopping boats. It’s much, much harder to really deal with big structural issues around economic inequalities and misogyny.”Rupert Lowe reports charity rowers to coastguard as possible ‘illegal migrants’Read moreThelargest anti-migrant protestshave centred around the Bell hotel in Epping in Essex. On Tuesday, the district council applied for an interim high court injunction in an effort to stop asylum seekers from being housed there.Oliver Coppard, the Labour mayor ofSouth Yorkshire, urged politicians and the media to take a responsible approach over predicting disorder connected to asylum and migration, saying some people were “seemingly trying to will it into existence”.Coppard’s region experiencedsome of the worst troublelast summer, when a far-right mob attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers near Rotherham.The area was, he said, “in a very different place now”, adding: “The last thing we need is politicians trying to talk up the chances of that sort of thing happening again.“Politicians of all stripes have a responsibility to be measured in their comments, to try to bring people together. And that’s not what we’re seeing from certain parts of both the Tory party and Reform.”Coppard singled out the Conservative leader,Kemi Badenoch, and the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, saying they were using asylum and migration “as a political football rather than speaking responsibly on behalf of the whole of the country”.Badenoch said on Tuesday that she understood why people in Epping were protesting, and alleged women had “stopped jogging in the park because there are men lurking in bushes”.“The people who I spoke to are having a lot of concerns about safety” she said.“Mothers told me that they’re worried about their daughters going to school. They’re getting harassed. They stopped jogging in the park because there are men lurking in bushes.“Communities shouldn’t have to be paying for this. And what I saw in Epping really, really upset me. I can see why many of those people are protesting.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumMigrationKemi BadenochEssexWalesNorfolkBournemouthnewsShareReuse this content"

It means an increased risk of death from really common infections. It means more amputations. It’s a horrible picture,” said Krystel Moussally, epidemiology adviser to Médecins Sans Frontières and aco-author of studieson drug-resistant bacteria in Gaza and other conflict zones in the Middle East, who was not involved in the research.Gaza doctors ‘becoming too weak to treat patients’ as hunger crisis deepensRead moreThe study is based on more 1,300 samples from at al-Ahli hospital, where one of the few microbiology laboratories that is still functional in Gaza is based. Two-thirds of the samples, taken from patients over a 10-month period last year, showed the presence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria.Bilal Irfan, one of the authors of the study, described the results as “particularly alarming”.“We don’t even know the true scale because of the destruction of almost all the laboratories and the killing of a lot of the medical staff, so to even get a small insight into what is happening in Gaza is extremely important,” said Irfan, a bioethicist who conducts research at Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s hospital and the University of Michigan.Gaza has suffered for decades from high levels of multi-drug-resistant bacteria as a consequence of repeated conflicts and an Israeli blockade since 2007, when Hamas seized control.But the current context was unprecedented, experts said. Not only hasGaza’s healthcare system been decimatedbut sanitation systems have been destroyed, the disposal of garbage and solid waste has almost stopped and hunger is widespread among the 2.3 million population, making many more vulnerable to infection.On Tuesday, the World Health Organization saidIsraelshould let it stock medical supplies to deal with a “catastrophic” health situation in Gaza.“We want to stock up, and we all hear about more humanitarian supplies are allowed in – well it’s not happening yet, or it’s happening at a way too low a pace,” said Rik Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative in thePalestinian territories.Speaking from Jerusalem, Peeperkorn said Gaza had run out of more than half of medicines and the WHO was able to bring in fewer supplies than it wanted “due to the cumbersome procedures” and products “still denied” entry – a topic of constant negotiation with the Israeli authorities.Peeperkorn said only 50% of hospitals and 38% of primary health care centres were functioning, and even then only partly. Bed occupancy has reached 240% capacity in the Al-Shifa hospital and 300% at Al-Ahli hospital, both in northern Gaza.“The overall health situation remains catastrophic,” he said. “Hunger and malnutrition continue to ravage Gaza”.IsraeliMinistry of Defence officialssaid more than 45,000 tonnes of medical equipment had been transferred to Gaza since the beginning of the war and 13 fully equipped field hospitals established by international aid organisations.“Israel will continue to allow the entry of medical equipment and medicines into the Gaza Strip in accordance with international law and in coordination with the international community, while taking all possible measures to prevent the terrorist organisationHamasfrom seizing the aid and exploiting it for terrorist and military purposes,” the officials said.At least89 Palestinians, 31 seeking aid, have been killedand 513 injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza in the past 24 hours, according to the territory’s health ministry.Israel’s offensive in Gaza has now killed a total of 61,599 Palestinians and injured 154,088 since 7 October 2023.Q&AHow many Palestinians have been killed in Israel's campaign against Gaza?ShowAccording to health officials in Gaza, at least 60,000 people have been killed during Israel’s current military campaign, launched after the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 which killed nearly 1,200 people.The actual death toll is likely to be significantly higher, as the figure only includes Palestinians killed by bombs or bullets whose bodies have been recovered, leaving out thousands trapped under the rubble or killed by starvation and other indirect victims of the campaign.According to the data – which includes the deaths of militants – women, children, and elderly people account for approximately 55% of the recorded deaths.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Three-quarters of the samples studied by Irfan and the other authors of the new study were taken from casualties suffering traumatic wounds inflicted by Israeli airstrikes or similar attacks.In the Lancet, the authors said the threat from drug-resistant bacteria would escalate unless there was an end to the Israeli offensive and the “deliberate targeting of hospitals, laboratories and water desalination plants”.Moussally said that the problem had been made worse by massive contamination of water sources and “no proper immunisation programmes” during the war.The conflict was triggered by a surprise attack by Hamas into Israel in which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted about 250 hostages, of whom 50 remain in Gaza. Only 20 are believed to still be alive.Explore more on these topicsGazaAntibioticsDrug resistanceIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He has strayed well beyond his justice brief and repeatedly caused controversy with his incendiary language on migration.There are reports that Vance will also meet Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, on Wednesday. Farage’s spokesperson did not reply to a request for comment.A Conservative source said that Jenrick was attending a drinks event with Vance on Tuesday evening alongside others, including the former chancellor George Osborne.They said Badenoch had been in contact with Vance but that they had been unable to find time for a meeting due to diary clashes. The US vice-president spent last weekend with David Lammy, the foreign secretary, while Badenoch has been in Epping and the Isle of Wight this week.Both Vance and Jenrick have expressed staunch opposition to equality, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and voiced concerns about the erosion of freedom of speech.In February, the vice-president claimed that a “backslide away from conscience rights has placed the basic liberties of religious Britons” under threat, and he attacked the use of laws to enforce buffer zones around abortion clinics.Asked about his remarks before meeting Lammy last Friday, Vance claimed that his concerns related more widely to “the entire collective west”.Vance is on holiday in the Cotswolds with his family and has been pictured visiting the Daylesford farm shop near Chipping Norton.Responding to reports that Farage was due to meet Vance, the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, called on Farage to “tell the White House that in Europe we stand together against Putin’s aggression”.He added: “But Farage won’t do that because he’s much more interested in pleasing Trump than in standing up for British values and European security.”Explore more on these topicsJD VanceRobert JenrickConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

InSpain, a Romanian man in his 50s died after suffering 98% burns while trying to rescue horses from a burning stable near Madrid on Monday night.A four-year-old boy who was found unconscious in his family’s car in Sardinia died in Rome on Monday after suffering irreversible brain damage caused by heatstroke. And in Montenegro, one soldier died and another was seriously injured when their water tanker overturned while fighting wildfires in the hills north of the capital, Podgorica, on Tuesday.Scientist have warned that the heat currently affecting large parts ofEuropeis creating perfect conditions for wildfires and serving as another reminder of the climate emergency.Canada wildfire season already second worst on record as experts warn of ‘new reality’Read more“Thanks to climate change, we now live in a significantly warmer world,” Akshay Deoras, a research scientist at the University of Reading’s meteorology department told Agence France-Presse, adding that “many still underestimate the danger”.The fire in Tres Cantos, near Madrid – which had been fuelled by winds of 70km/h (45mph) and which has devoured 1,000 hectares of land – was still not under control on Tuesday evening, when further strong gusts were expected. The regional government said it had recovered 150 dead sheep and 18 dead horses from the area.More than 3,700 people were evacuated from 16 municipalities amid dozens of reported blazes in the north-western region of Castilla y León, including one that damaged the Unesco world heritage-listed Roman-era mining site at Les Médulas.Authorities in neighbouring Galicia said the largest wildfire of the year had burned through 3,000 hectares of land in Ourense province. In the southern town of Tarifa, firefighters on the ground and in planes battled a fire that broke out on Monday, with 2,000 people evacuated.The blazes have led the interior ministry to declare a “pre-emergency phase” to help coordinate emergency resources.View image in fullscreenFirefighters work to extinguish a forest fire in Lamas de Olo, in the Alvao natural park, Portugal.Photograph: Pedro Sarmento Costa/EPAThe prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, offered his condolences to the family of the man who died after the Tres Cantos fire, and thanked the emergency services for their “tireless efforts”.He urged people to recognise the seriousness of the situation. “We’re at extreme risk of forest fires,” he said in a message on X on Tuesday. “Let’s be very careful.”In neighbouringPortugal, firefighters were battling three large wildfires in the centre and north of the country.Authorities in Greece requested EU help as fires, fuelled by gale force winds, ripped across vast swathes of the western Peloponnese and emergency services ordered the evacuation of thousands of residents.Firefighters were also trying to contain blazes on the popular Ionian tourist islands of Zakynthos and Kefalonia. With gusts hampering firefighting efforts, emergency services ordered all hotels in the region of Agala and Keri on Zakynthos to temporarily close, forcing suitcase-wielding holidaymakers to flee and relocate to other areas.View image in fullscreenA house burning during a wildfire that erupted in a forest near the village of Agalas on Zakynthos.Photograph: Costas Synetos/EPABy late Tuesday, dozens of firefighters, supported by 15 fire trucks and eight water-bombing planes and helicopters, were still trying to douse the fast-moving flames.“Everything that civil protection can offer is here but there are very strong winds and the fires are out of control,” said the island’s mayor, Giorgos Stasinopoulos. “We need a lot more air support, it’s vital.”The fire service said it was also dealing with blazes farther north in Epirus, around Preveza and in the central region of Aetolia-Acarnania.Despite temperatures nudging 43C in some parts of the Peloponnese region of southern Greece on Tuesday – and the prolonged drought, which has produced highly flammable conditions on tinder-dry soil – officials described the outbreak of so many fires as “suspiciously high”.Faced with an estimated 63 blazes erupting and firefighters confronting flames on 106 fronts, fire officers dispatched specialist teams to several of the stricken regions to investigate possible arson.InAlbania, hundreds of firefighters and troops had subdued most of the nearly 40 fires that flared up in the past 24 hours, the defence ministry said, but more than a dozen were still active.Since the start of July, nearly 34,000 hectares have been scorched nationwide, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. Police say many of the blazes were deliberate, with more than 20 people arrested.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of the blaze in Çanakkale, Turkey, on Tuesday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn Croatia, about 150 firefighters spent Monday night defending homes near the port city of Split.In the north-western Turkish province of Çanakkale, more than 2,000 people were evacuated and 77 people treated in hospital for smoke inhalation after fires broke out near the tourist village of Güzelyalı, authorities said.Images on Turkish media showed homes and cars ablaze, while more than 760 firefighters, 10 planes, nine helicopters and more than 200 vehicles were deployed to battle the flames.Turkeythis year experienced its hottest July since records began 55 years ago.In southern France, where temperature records were broken in at least four weather stations, the government called for vigilance.The south-western city of Bordeaux hit a record 41.6C on Monday, while all-time records were broken at meteorological stations in Bergerac, Cognac and Saint Girons, according to the national weather service, Météo France.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsWildfiresSpainExtreme heatExtreme weatherEuropePortugalTurkeynewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, there areat least 49 citiesin the world with higher homicide rates than the US capital.However, his comparison to Latin American capitals was mostly accurate, and unwittingly pointing to the fact that many of these cities – which have stereotypically been viewed as deadly, crime-infested places to live – have become safer than some US metropolises.Mexico City’s homicide rate in 2024 was 10 per 100,000 residents, according to government figures, versus27.5 per 100,000 for Washington DC.Meanwhile Bogotahad a homicide rateof 15.2 and Lima saw 7.7 per 100,000.“Mexico City has a third of the homicides that Washington has,”said Mexico City’s mayor Clara Brugada. “It’s very important to clarify this because otherwise it could be misinterpreted, and people could think that Mexico City has one of the highest homicide rates in the Americas, and that’s just not true.”Is Mexico City’s plummeting murder rate too good to be true?Read moreDespite its relatively low homicide rate, however, Mexico City did report nearly 1,300 missing or disappeared people last year, some of whommay be murder victimswhose bodies were never found.Guerrero said that Mexico City, with its large, centralized police force, its lower rates of extortion to organized crime, its state monitoring over taxi fleets, and the access it affords to centers for professional training and education, is unique in the country, which is still wrestling surging levels of violence fueled by organized crime.The neighboring state of Mexico, for example, has a homicide rate of 19 per 100,000, nearly double that of the capital’s, and nationwide, Mexico had anoverall homicide rateof 24 per 100,000 in 2023 – a rate more than six times higher thanthat of the US.“Mexico City is a kind of island of tranquility when we compare it with the rest of the country,” said Guerrero.Leaders in other Latin American countries also took issue with Trump’s use of their capitals as a point of comparison for his vision of Washington DC as a place of “crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor and worse”.Colombian president, Gustavo Petro,said on X: “President Trump should know, and if not someone should tell him, that Bogotá is one of the places on earth where not a single child dies of hunger. That makes it one of the best places on earth.”Ibaneis Rocha, the governor of the federal district encompassing Brazil’s capital, Brasília, posted a long letter to the US presidenton Xdisputing Trump’s claims that the city was among the world’s most violent.“It is necessary to clarify, based on official data, that this perception does not reflect the reality of the Brazilian capital,” said Rocha, listing a series of government programs aimed at reducing violent crime. “The management of public security in the Federal District is, in essence, aligned with a vision of ‘law and order,’ reinforcing that the resolute fight against crime, combined with social policies with real impact, is the path to a safe and prosperous society.”According to Rocha, last year, Brasília had a homicide rate of 6.9 per 100,000 residents, the third lowest among Brazilian state capitals and almost four times lower than that of Washington DC.Explore more on these topicsClaudia SheinbaumDonald TrumpMexicoWashington DCanalysisShareReuse this content"

At that moment, another woman, who Coronel presumes was the man’s wife, ushered him away.“I have short hair and don’t mind if people think I look male. I’ve often been called ‘Sir’ but when they see my face they either apologise or ask me politely what I like to be called. But I’ve never had anyone approach me before in such a publicly aggressive way.”“What then flashed through my mind was:Is this what this ruling has done?”The fight for trans safety is a fight for everyone’s safety – MPs must have the chance to debate it | Freddy McConnellRead moreSince the supreme court’sruling on biological sex, debate around its practical application has focused heavily on access to women’s toilet and changing facilities – in particular after initial advice on implementation from the equalities watchdog, the Equality and Human Rights Commission,amounted to a blanket banon trans people using toilets of their lived gender, which many say in effect excludes them from public spaces.Critics of the ruling have suggested it may likewise affect cis women who do not adhere to a straight, white template of femininity.Support groups report some early indications that gender non-conforming women are facing increased challenges, raising wider questions about how women read each other’s bodies and whether women’s toilets have ever been entirely safe spaces.View image in fullscreenClaire Prihartini, who had a bilateral mastectomy, was challenged by a woman in the changing room of her local pool.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianOthers say these anxieties amount to scaremongering from those who do not agree with the judgment of the supreme court.Claire Prihartini was diagnosed with breast cancer a year and a half ago. “I had a really lucky experience: I found out early, opted for a bilateral mastectomy and didn’t need further treatment.” Her chest is now flat, with two small scars and no nipples.Last month, Prihartini was in the women’s changing room area of her local pool. “I was standing with my top off in front of the mirror putting on my swimming cap. Another woman walked in, gasped audibly and said: ‘There’s a man in here!’ I said: ‘Oh I’m not a man …’ in a friendly way, then she said aggressively: ‘You look like a man, there aren’t meant to be men in here’ and continued to look at my body. I didn’t want to engage with her any further so I just walked off into the pool.”Prihartini, whose experience was first shared on social media by her husband, Jolyon Maugham, founder of the Good Law Project, is at pains to make clear that this was not “a massively traumatic experience”. After she walked away the other woman did not continue to challenge her. Like Coronel, however, she links the incident directly to the supreme court ruling.“It shocked me that someone felt empowered in the moment to question someone else’s gender so rudely, that it’s becoming normalised.”While many of the non-conforming women the Guardian spoke to said being challenged in women’s spaces was by no means a new phenomenon for them, they added that they had identified an escalation since April’s ruling.“People who might have given me a look prior to the judgment have got quite bold in recent months,” says Dee, who did not want to give her second name. Dee was recently challenged by another woman in the changing rooms at Marks & Spencer, before unzipping her jacket to reveal her chest. “She began to apologise but then she said: ‘Well, you should be careful these days.’ She seemed to mean: how dare I appear masculine?”Transgender campaigners call for European rights body to report on UKRead moreTaranjit Chana of Black and Brown Rainbow, a grassroots anti-violence service, says their helpline has seen an increase in calls from black and Asian LGBTQ+ people who fear or have experienced challenge in toilets.“Women’s toilets have never felt entirely safe for black and brown women, because we don’t fit that binary way of looking. In some communities, facial hair is part of who we are, but in public toilets people stare and feel it is acceptable to make remarks because we don’t fit a narrow, European version of female.”Bridget Symonds, director of services at the LGBTQ+ anti-abuse charity Galop, said: “Galop has seen a significant increase in trans+ and gender diverse people coming to our frontline services for hate crime support.We’ve seen instances where LGBT+ people are being challenged and verbally abused when attempting to access toilets in public spaces, such as pubs. We’re hearing from cisgender lesbians who have been questioned about their gender in public toilets, something happening even before the ruling.”But some suggest these concerns are being overplayed. Jenny Willmott, co-founder of Scottish Lesbians, another gender critical group that intervened in support of theFor Women Scotland case, says she has been challenged in women’s toilets since she was a teenager.Willmott explains: “I’m the best part of 6ft4in, short hair, don’t wear makeup or skirts. Barely a week goes by that I don’t get a double-take. Women glance in, see a 6ft body with short hair and think: ‘Aah!’. But after the second glance they think ‘Oh OK, it’s a woman.’”For Willmott, “it’s just something that happens. It used to bother me because we do need to broaden the bandwidth of what a biological woman looks like”.Other women’s experience of challenge is less straightforward. Nikki Lucas, who has short hair and usually wears a cap along with a shirt and trousers, says: “If you’re masculine presenting or butch lesbian, women’s toilets are not a safe space. I’ve been spat on, screamed at and it’s just so sad that this looks likely to get worse.“The looks of hate, the feeling that you just don’t know if you’re going to be safe, have really got worse since the ruling, to the extent I now either ask a friend to come in with me or use the disabled toilet, which I feel bad about because it’s preventing them from accessing it.”Coronel shared her Royal Festival Hall experience on social media afterwards: “I’ve had so many messages from trans women who’ve lived fully as women, used women’s facilities for 20 years or more, who are now scared that they’ll be asked to prove themselves. It’s really awful.”“Now, more than ever, we need kindness and compassion and a genuine effort to understand each other, even towards those with prejudice.”Explore more on these topicsGenderWomenTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsEquality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)featuresShareReuse this content"

Well, you might not have a choice. Ever since filming on the Anne Hathaway/Meryl Streep reunion commenced in New York a few weeks ago, set photos and accompanyingnews itemshave become plentiful (don’t click that link if you don’t want to know the rumors about a major star). Of course, gossip pages breathlessly reporting casting rumors are not sanctioned by a movie studio, like a teaser, poster, trailer or announcement video. At the same time, the movie hype machine has been blurring the line between genuine marketing and tweet-grade micro-teases all summer long.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For example: is there a teaser trailer for next summer’s Spider-Man: Brand New Day? It’s the next Marvel movie after this July’sFantastic Four reboot, and plenty of summer blockbusters-to-be have called their shots with a teaser a year in advance, so it would make sense to get a little something out there. A teaser is kinda-sorta what Sonyposteda few weeks ago, only it was hyped up as a “suit reveal”, which seems like an attempt to redress a 20-second teaser in literal new clothes. It also seems like a backfire if the strategy involves anyone beyond the most diehard 5% of movie-watchers realizing or caring that Tom Holland walks up to the camera wearing a Spider-Man costume that is slightly different than the six other Spider-Man costumes he’s donned in other appearances. There is also abehind-the-scenes videoof a movie that’s barely started filming. It recalls the absurdly lengthy “chair reveal” ofcast membersfrom Avengers: Doomsday parceled out over five hours, which is getting its own sequel soon. (Not everyone was announced, of course. Not least because the movie’s screenplay was not finished at the time of that announcement and filming commencement.)EvenChristopher Nolan, who has generally mastered the art of keeping his highly anticipated movies to the realm of teasers and trailers – a teaser for his Imax-shot version ofThe Odysseyemerged just about a year before its planned July 2026 release – succumbed to the hype machine when that Odyssey teaser was accompanied by tickets forselect showtimes going on sale. That’s right, if you want to plan a movie outing 50 weeks from now, you can see about booking an Odyssey ticket at your local Imax (if applicable). Or rather, you could have if your AMC app didn’t crash; most of those showings sold out quickly.To some extent, this is business as usual. There’s been year-out hype for movies for literal decades at this point;Alien 3had ateaser trailerthat infamously teased a movie with a completely different premise (Aliens on Earth?!). Some of it is also just the studios attempting to compete with the speed and ferocity of digital-era hype, to be heard above the constant buzz of phone notifications over virtually nothing (as well as the semi-regular global calamity). After all, the days of getting by on trailers, posters and TV ads alone are long gone, right?Yellowstone, Top Gun, Chalamet: what will the Paramount-Skydance merger mean for film and TV?Read moreMaybe not. Thebiggest global openingof the past weekend was the horror movieWeapons, which exceeded expectations for its launch based largely off of ... trailers that explained the premise of the movie. Obviously there’s more to a marketing campaign than that. In the spring, the film launched awebsitemocked up to look like news postings about Maybrook, the fictional town in the movie, with shades of The Blair Witch Project from 1999. But the baseline of the movie’s marketing was a couple of trailers that showed a lot of creepy imagery but said little about the multi-character plot beyond what the movie reveals in its first two minutes: one night, a group of third-graders from the same class mysteriously rise from their beds, run outside, and disappear into the night. The movie is about figuring out what happened to them; no casting announcements, announcement videos, or greetings from the set needed. For well over a year, about the only thing anyone repeated about this movie in the Hollywood trade publications was that it was a “horror epic” with some elements in common with another 1999 classic, Paul Thomas Anderson’s Magnolia.Of course, Weapons operated with the luxury of less attention from both its studio and the outside press. It’s not the kind of superhero movie or high-profile sequel that gets clicks a year before it comes out. But this strategy isn’t only employed for smaller films. Disney’sLilo & Stitch remake, the second-biggest global hit of the year so far, certainly had plenty of promotion, tie-ins, brand activations and so on. But it successfully waited until much closer to its release date, putting out a couple of traditional low-footage teasers at the end of 2024, and a full trailer a few months before the movie’s release in 2025.Sinners, an ambitious movie with an audience more in line with Weapons, also managed to avoid selling much-hyped nothingburgers, and was able to take audiences by surprise.Next year’s crop of much-hyped sequels will still probably draw crowds. Streep, Hathaway, Nolan, Spider-Man and whoever is in the Avengers these days all have plenty of fans. But the rush to blow up what would normally be lines in a press release to an epic and ceremonious scale still feels sweaty – maybe sweatier, even, as if companies including Disney are desperate to project the image of day-stopping news when another name of an old X-Men cast member turns up on a chair. As recently as the release ofDeadpool & Wolverine, the company prized spoiler protection, with almost none of the movie’s various in-joke cameos signaled ahead of time. That seemed like good marketing, but maybe it was just fear of the fact that many of those cameos were intentionally expectations-undermining jokes, rather than mega-applause moments. It’s harder to tell in retrospect because the hype machine has spent so much time accidentally eliminating the difference between teasers, spoilers and piles of random crumbs.Explore more on these topicsFilmSpider-ManChristopher NolanTom HollandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In actor-writer Issy Knowles’ monologue, the setup is similar: on a stage dominated by a bed and littered with condoms, Pollie arrives in a blue silk dressing gown to meet a thousand subscribers as she grants them each a freebie.Pollie is given her own queasy lines of enticement to her fans. But how do you satirise a phenomenon – sex as competitive sport – that is already so extreme in nature? Knowles humorously deadpans Pollie’s insistence that she finds her enterprise erotic, saying how sexy it is to oversee hundreds of legal waivers for the men. Pollie’s discovery that her first visitor is above the age of consent is played as comic frustration, though the question of the character’s predatory behaviour is not deeply pursued. Wearing fake plastic buttocks and breasts, Knowles trains a steely gaze and fixed smile on the audience, who are given the choice to wear balaclavas, like the men queueing for their turn, yet the scattering of masked theatregoers adds little to the atmosphere.Edinburgh fringe 2025: the best theatre and comedy we’ve already reviewedRead moreKnowles considers Pollie’s religious upbringing and first boyfriends but also how society creates and reacts to such sexual extremities. This is done through a voiceover of interview-style questions, many of which are more probing than in Channel 4’s documentary. Pollie compares her “liberating” work with her past career as a consultant, the office tasks choreographed as sex acts. The movement direction is frequently bold to match the bluntness of the script.The flashbacks can be indistinctive but Knowles also delves into the minds of the men in the queue, generally less held to account than OnlyFans stars, and their parasocial relationships with Pollie. She plays an incel spouting conspiracy theories whose violent fantasies are followed by erectile dysfunction. The writing balances dark humour with serious assessment of the men’s discontent, anger and desire for control, recognising the role, too, of ragebait in Pollie’s success (“hate is money … money is power”). She is always compelling in the troubling encounters with expectant subscribers who believe they are not just “only” fans.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalSexPornographyreviewsShareReuse this content"

From the wild, rugged shores of Baranof Island to Anchorage, the state’s largest city, Russian Orthodox churches with their distinctive onion-shaped domes still dot the landscape.View image in fullscreenSt Michael’s Cathedral, a Russian Orthodox church in Sitka, Alaska.Photograph: Michael Maslan/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesRussia’s foothold in Alaska began not with armies, but fur. In the mid-18th century, merchants and adventurers pushed east across Siberia, spurred by the promise of lucrative sea otter pelts. By the 1780s, Catherine the Great had authorised the creation of the Russian-American Company, granting it a monopoly over trade and governance in the territory.Alexander Baranov, a hard-driving merchant, consolidated Russia’s hold on the region in the late 18th century, expanding settlements and ruthlessly suppressing resistance, most famously from the native Tlingit, who gave him the grim nickname “No Heart”.Russian Orthodox priests soon followed, establishing missions and building churches. In New Archangel (now Sitka), they raised St Michael’s Cathedral, its green dome rising against a backdrop of glaciers, still anchoring the town’s view more than 150 years later.But by the mid-19th century, the Russian empire had come to see Alaska as more of a liability than an asset, and began quietly seeking a buyer. In the wake of its humiliating defeat in the Crimean war, the territory had become a drain on St Petersburg’s finances, compounded by mounting fears over Britain’s expanding naval presence in the Pacific.In a letter to a friend in July 1867, Eduard de Stoeckl, the Russian envoy in Washington and chief negotiator of the sale, admitted: “My treaty has met with strong opposition … but this stems from the fact that no one at home has any idea of the true condition of our colonies. It was simply a matter of selling them, or watching them being taken from.”The sale of Alaska emerged as a rare diplomatic win-win: for Russia, a way to recoup cash, gain a new, emerging ally across the Atlantic and sidestep a potential conflict with Britain; for the US, an opportunity to forestall European encroachment and assert its growing influence in the Pacific.Still, when the Russian empire agreed the sale in 1867, few on either side of the Pacific saw it at first as an outright triumph.In St Petersburg, it was viewed by some as the latest imperial humiliation. The colony, remote and costly to supply, had never been a jewel of the empire, yet the price – $7.2m – struck many as insultingly low.The liberal paper Golos dismissed the transaction as “deeply angering all true Russians”.“Is the nation’s sense of pride truly so unworthy of attention that it can be sacrificed for a mere six or seven million dollar[s],” the paper wrote.Across the US, the secretary of state, William H Seward, who negotiated the treaty, was ridiculed for spending what critics saw as an unreasonable sum on a frozen wilderness. The New-York Daily Tribune dismissed the acquisition as “the nominal possession of impassable deserts of snow”.“We may make a treaty with Russia,” its editorial complained, “but we cannot make a treaty with the North Wind or the Snow King.”View image in fullscreenPortrait of a hunter in Alaska, 1910-20.Photograph: Marka/Touring Club Italiano/Universal Images Group/GettyOthers wondered if the price was suspiciously low, and whether Russia had simply palmed off a worthless scrap of territory. “Russia has sold us a sucked orange. Whatever may be the value of that territory and its outlying islands to us, it has ceased to be of any to Russia,” the New York World wrote on 1 April 1867.Yet that perception would soon be dramatically overturned. The gold rushes of the late 19th century, and the discovery of oilfields decades later, transformed what had once been mocked as folly into one of the US’s most resource-rich territories – and one of history’s great bargains.The cheap sale remained etched in Russian memory and has occasionally inspired fringe nationalist calls to reclaim Alaska. In 1974, when Americans protested against the low price the USSR paid for wheat, the Soviet trade official Vladimir Alkimov drily noted that Alaska had been sold for only $7m.In 1867, the mood was different. For a short time, the Alaska sale opened a fleeting chapter of warmth between Russia and the US.View image in fullscreenRussian and American diplomats sign the Treaty of Cession, under which the US bought Alaska from the Russian empire in 1867.Photograph: Pictorial Parade/Getty ImagesThe New York Herald lauded in 1867 what looked like a potential new ally in Russia, writing: “The cession of Russian Alaska becomes a matter of great importance. It indicates the extent to which Russia is ready to carry out herentente cordialewith the United States,” the paper continued.That warming of ties would culminate in 1871, when Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich led a naval squadron to New York, where he was greeted with military parades, gala receptions and civic honors.When Trump and Putin meet in Alaska this week, the backdrop will be the prospect of a historic renewal of ties. For Kyiv, the hope is that this time such warmth will not come at the expense of its territory – and that the era of trading land like currency in great power deals is in the past.Explore more on these topicsAlaskaRussiaDonald TrumpVladimir PutinUkrainefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This isn’t about people looking for jobs with a $10,000 salary.What else could it be about?It’s about spending $10,000 to geta job in the first place.Oh no, I do not like this at all.And yet it appears to be becoming the standard.According to the Wall Street Journal, jobseekers are finding work so scarce that they’re being driven to spend greater and greater sums to stand out from the crowd.What are they spending it on?The $10,000 figure is what Josh Morgan, 45, paid for six months of work with a career strategist, who offered regular meetings, a personal website and access to recruiters.But why?Because the time people spend looking for work is growing. In the US, it’s now an average of 24 weeks, a month longer than a year ago. But there are other expenses.Of course there are.Some people shell out for courses to keep their expertise up to date. Others pay for premium LinkedIn accounts that allow better networking. There are expensive job databases to subscribe to, CV-sharpening services and AI programs that train you to do better in interviews.And if you don’t pay for them,you get lost in the crowd.Exactly. At least until everyone starts doing it, at which point the services will jack up their prices to help jobseekers stand out fromthatcrowd.

Some Chinese colleges stipulate that students must find work within a year of graduation or they won’t receive a diploma. So, graduates pay to turn up, then send an office picture to their tutors to get their certificates.That’s as grim as it gets.The man who owns the company told the BBC he was offering“the dignity of not being a useless person”.OK,thatis as grim as it gets.For now.

Here, Aminatta Forna recalls the man and introduces his essay on decolonisationByNgũgĩ wa Thiong’owith introduction byAminatta FornaTue 12 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 05.29 EDTShareIn the 1930s, it was common for British missionaries to change the names of African school pupils to biblical names. The change wasn’t “just for school” – it was intended to be for ever. So Ngũgĩ became James and my father, Mohamed, became Moses. While many students retained their new names throughout their lives, Ngũgĩ and my father changed theirs back, though you can still find early editions of Ngũgĩ’s first book, Weep Not, Child, under the name of “James Ngugi”. With the novel, Ngũgĩ established himself as a writer and later, by reclaiming his Kikuyu identity as an activist, began a process of decolonisation that he would explore in one of his most famous nonfiction works, Decolonising the Mind (1986), which challenged the dominance of European languages in African education and literature. Ngũgĩ worked throughout his life to promote the decolonisation of language, writing and publishing his books in Kikuyu and only later translating them himself into English.Ngũgĩ was a campaigner against the legacy of colonialism, but first and foremost a Marxist. Studying at the University of Leeds in the 1960s, he witnessed first-hand the brutality of the police towards striking white miners and realised that economic exploitation was a class issue and not a purely racial one. He endured exile, imprisonment, physical assault and harassment by the postcolonial Kenyan authorities and yet never stopped writing and publishing, even penning one of his works, Devil on the Cross (originally titled Caitaani mũtharaba-Inĩ), on prison toilet paper. Detained for his involvement with community theatre groups, Ngũgĩ noted that as long as he wrote in English, the authorities ignored him. Only when he began to write politically critical plays in Kikuyu, and ordinary working people could understand them, was he arrested.View image in fullscreenAminatta Forna.Photograph: PRNgũgĩ was one of the grandfathers of African literature, and his courage made him beloved of a generation of writers. At the 2015 Pen World Voices festival, Ngũgĩ opted to stay in the same hotel as the other African writers, while others of his stature chose loftier accommodation. Here, the likes of Lola Shoneyin, Alain Mabanckou, the late Binyavanga Wainaina, Taiye Selasi, Ngũgĩ’s son Mukoma wa Ngũgĩ and me fetched the cups of tea he drank all day long, found a pen he needed or hailed a taxi on his behalf. One evening I helped organise an after-dinner party in a local bar. Ngũgĩ went to bed early, set an alarm, rose and joined us in the bar. He wanted tea, but the bar didn’t serve it. So someone ran out and fetched him one. In May this year, Ngũgĩ was apparently dancing with some of his students at the University of California, Irvine, to mark the end of the semester on the Friday before his death, at the age of 87.Aminatta FornaSince the publication of my book Decolonising the Mind in 1986, I have seen, over the years, increasing global interest in issues of decolonisation and the unequal power relationships between languages. In 2018, the same issues took me to Limerick in Munster, Ireland, for a conference celebrating 125 years since the foundation of the Gaelic League (Conradh na Gaeilge), in 1893.The league was dedicated to the revival of Gaelic, or Irish, which by then, in its own country, had become subordinate to the dominant English. Despite many efforts, including official government support for its revival, Irish is still subordinate to English. More Irish speak and use English than they do Irish. Some of the most iconic Irish writers, such as WB Yeats and James Joyce, wrote in English, and they are studied as part of the canon of English literature. I cannot conceive of an English department anywhere in the world, including Britain itself, which didn’t teach courses in these writers of Irish origin. They have become some of the greatest contributors to English literature.This unequal power relationship between the two languages in favour of the English was not always the case. The early English settlers in Ireland, Munster in particular, gravitated toward Irish because, by all accounts, in the beginnings of English settlement – particularly between the 13th and 16th centuries – the Irish language was the more endowed in classical learning. Naturally, those early settlers were drawn to the more vibrant Irish tongue. Their gravitation made sense: Irish was the majority tongue, spoken by those among whom the English planters had settled.London acted, and beginning with the 1366 Statutes of Kilkenny, it passed edicts aimed at protecting the English language against the subversive encroachment of Irish or Gaelic, reinforcing by law the use of English while literally criminalising Irish. Among other things, the Kilkenny statutes threatened to confiscate any lands of any English or any Irish living among them who would use “Irish among themselves, contrary to the ordnance”. These policies were given a literary and philosophical rationale by none other than the poet Edmund Spenser, author of The Faerie Queene and himself a settler in Munster. In his pamphlet A View of the Present State of Irelande, published in 1596, he argued that language and naming systems were the best means of bringing about the erasure of Irish memory: “It hath ever been the use of the conqueror to despise the language of the conquered, and to force him by all means to learn his.”The marginal status of Irish in its own land did not come about by some kind of natural evolution. The decline of Irish in its own land was brought about through conscious political acts and educational policies.Ireland, it has been observed, was England’s first settler colony. It became a kind of laboratory for other English settler colonies that followed. And what was true for Ireland and other English colonies was equally so for other colonial systems, whether Spanish, French or Portuguese, or the Japanese occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945. It is also true in the case of domestic colonialism, such as the Norwegian suppression of the language of Sami people. The suppression of the languages of the dominated and the elevation of the language of conquest and domination were integral to the education system that accompanied conquest and colonial occupation.Linguistic suppression was not undertaken for the aesthetic joy of doing so. Spenser was clear that the colonisation of the Irish language and naming system would make the Irish forget who they were, weaken their resistance, and therefore make it easier for the English to conquer and subdue them.Languageconquest, unlike the military form, is cheaper and more effective: the conqueror has only to invest in capturing the minds of the elite, who will then spread submission to the rest of the population. The elite become part of the linguistic army of the conqueror.Because of its centrality in the making of modern Britain, India became, even more than Ireland, a social laboratory, whose results were later exported to other colonies in Asia andAfrica. Thomas Babington Macaulay, as a member of the Supreme Council of India from 1834 to 1838, helped reform the colony’s education system as well as draw up its penal code; both activities have a special significance. In his famous 1835 Minutes on Indian Education, Macaulay advocated the replacement of Sanskrit and Persian with English as the language of education in order to form a class of “interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern, a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect”.Macaulay saw this new language education as bringing about a “civilised state in which the values and standards are to be the values and standards of Britain, in which every one, whatever his origins, has an interest and a part”. A century later, Macaulay’s words would be repeated in colonialKenyaby the then British governor, Sir Philip Mitchell. He outlined a policy for English language dominance in African education which he saw as a moral crusade to supplement the armed crusade against the Kenya Land and Freedom Army, a liberation army the British called the Mau Mau.View image in fullscreenNgũgĩ in December 1980.Photograph: Frank Martin/The GuardianIn 1879, Capt Richard Henry Pratt founded the infamous Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where he devised his own variant of the method for Native American children, less than 20 miles across the scenic Susquehanna River from the steps of the state capitol in Harrisburg. In 1892, he summed up the philosophy behind the boarding school: “Kill the Indian in him, and save the man.” His education programme followed the same colonial pattern: uproot a few from their mother tongue, which is spoken by most of their people, mould them anew in the language of conquest, and then unleash them on the governed masses.In his book How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, Walter Rodney quotes Pierre Foncin, a founder of the Alliance Française, an institution specifically created in 1883 for the propagation of the national language in the colonies and abroad, as being very clear about the goal of the mission. It was “necessary to attach the colonies to the metropole by a very solid psychological bond against the day when their progressive emancipation ends in a form of federation, as is probable – that they be and they remain French in language, thought and spirit”.The goal was very clear. Imperial educational policies were meant to create colonies of the mind, among the elite of the colonised. The success of these policies is undeniable. A variation of the Irish situation, where even after independence, the intellectuals express themselves more fluently in the language of imperial conquest than in the languages from their own country, is present in every postcolonial situation. In the case of Africa, you even hear the identity of the continent being described in terms of Europhonity: anglophone, francophone and lusophone, mainly.Even where the elite are nationalistic and assertive of their independence, they find it easier to express their outrage and hopes in the languages of imperial conquest. Ninety per cent of the moneys allocated for language education goes to pamper imperial languages. Ninety per cent of the population still speaks African languages anyway. Some governments even view African languages as enemies of progress. They believe that imperial languages are really the gateway to global modernity.Under normal circumstances, it would sound odd to hear that French literature can only be written in Japanese, or English literature in IsiZulu, so that when you meet a French writer who writes in French, you look at them in surprise: why on earth are you writing in French? Or an English writer writing in English: why are you not writing in Zulu? And yet this absurdity is expected of African writers and writers from those formerly colonised.How did this absurdity come about? It is not that some languages are more “of language” than others. And under any circumstances, to know more languages can only empower the person. But this was not the case in colonial contexts or any context in which there is a dominating and dominated. It was never a case of adding a new language to what one already had. For the colonial conqueror, it was not enough to introduce an additional language to any community. Imperial languages had to be planted on the graveyard of the languages of the dominated. The death of African languages gave life to European languages. In order for the imperial language to be, the language of the colonised had to cease to be. Amnesia for African languages;anamnesisfor European languages.These two conditions are not inherent in the character of the languages involved. They are mental conditions consciously brought about by how the imperial languages were imposed. In Decolonising the Mind, I have talked about the corporal punishment meted out to African children caught speaking an African language at school, children who were then made to carry a placard around the neck proclaiming their stupidity. In some cases, the culprit was made to swallow filth, thus associating African languages with criminality, pain and filth.This was not just in Africa.In his 2015 testimony to the Waitangi Tribunal about his experiences of school in New Zealand, Dover Samuels, a Māori politician, tells a similar story. Caught speaking Māori in the school, he said: “You’d be hauled out in front of the rest of the class and told to bend over. You’d bend over and he’d stand back and give you, what they called it then, six of the best. On many occasions, not only did it leave bruises behind on my thighs but drew blood.”The Sami people in Norway went through a similar experience in the period between 1870 and 1970 – what they call the brutal century – in an attempt to turn them into fluent Norwegian-language speakers. Violence against native languages is the running theme in the spread of English in Ireland, and in Scotland and Wales. In Wales, those who spoke Welsh in the school compound were made to stand in front of the class, with a placard reading WELSH NOT hanging from their neck. Violence was central in creating the psychological bond of language, culture and thought: colonies of the mind. You would think that after liberation and independence, the new nations, at the very least, would dismantle that unequal power relationship. But that is precisely the power of the colonies of the mind: negativity toward self has become internalised as a way of looking at reality.It is a classic case of conditioning you will find in manuals of behavioural psychology. Conditioning is a system of reward and punishment: punishment for undesired behaviour and reward for the desired behaviour. It is often used in various degrees of intensity in bringing up children or taming animals. The undesired behaviour becomes associated with punishment, and hence pain; the desired behaviour with reward, and hence pleasure. The object of conditioning, a child or an animal, comes to automatically avoid the space of pain, the forbidden behaviour, and gravitate toward the space of pleasure, the required behaviour. In the case of learning, one became the recipient of glory for excelling in the language of conquest, but the recipient of a gory mess for uttering even a single word in one’s mother tongue. One’s mother tongue became the space of pain, to be avoided, and the conquering language became the space of pleasure, to be desired.View image in fullscreenNgũgĩ during a book presentation in Washington DC in 2006.Photograph: Washington Post/Getty ImagesThe trauma experienced by the first generation of the conditioned can be passed on as normal behaviour that needs no explanation or justification; the later generations may not even understand why they associate pain with native languages and pleasure with foreign languages and cultures. The elite and educational planners of the formerly colonised societies assume that European (imperial) languages are inherently global and best able to carry intelligence and universality. That assumption may also explain why criminalising African languages continues to this day, now administered and enforced by African educationalists who don’t see the irony of what they are doing: an African punishing another African for speaking an African language, by order of an African government.The trauma initially wrought by the colonial education system is thus passed on, inherited. Abnormality becomes normalised. The colony of the mind prevents meaningful, nationally empowering innovations in education. Control by the coloniser of the colonised is inherent in the inequality of the education system. Education may become a process of mystifying the cognitive process and even knowledge.Here we need to make a distinction between education and knowledge. Knowledge is a question of continuously adding to what we already know in a dialectical play of mutual impact and illumination. The normal cognitive process starts from the known and heads toward the unknown. Every new step makes more of the unknown known and therefore adds to what is already known. The new known enriches the already known, and so on, in a continuous journey of making dialectically related connections. Knowledge of the world begins where one is.Education, on the other hand, is a mode of conditioning people to make them into, and function in, a given society. It may involve transference of knowledge, but it is conditioned knowledge, branded by the world outlook of the educator and the education system. A careful study of the colonial process, as a particular instance of the dominant and the dominated, the master and the servant, can be useful in thinking about balanced and inclusive education. Colonial education was never balanced or inclusive.The colonial process was always a negation of the normal cognitive process. Imperial Europe – its names, its geography, its history, its knowledge – was always seen as the starting point of the educational journey of the colonised. In short, colonisation, in the area of education, was always predicated on the negation of the colonised space as the starting point of knowledge. In the area of language, it meant a negation of native languages as valid sources of knowledge or as means of intellectual and artistic inquiry. The lack of roots in our base creates a state of permanent uncertainty about our relationship to where we are, to our abilities, even to our achievements.Decolonisation must be at the heart of any balanced and inclusive education. Both the formerly colonising and the formerly colonised are affected by a system that has shaped the globe over the last 400 years. Knowledge starts wherever we are. Our languages are valid sources of knowledge. We all love the stars, but we don’t have to migrate to Europe, physically or metaphorically, in order to reach them.View image in fullscreen‘All languages, large and small, have a lot to contribute to our common humanity’ … Ngũgĩ in 2022.Photograph: Michael Tyrone Delaney/The GuardianIn the case of languages, we have to reject the commonly held wisdom that the problem in any one country or the world is the existence of many languages and cultures, and even religions. The problem is their relationship in terms of hierarchy. My language is higher in the hierarchy than yours. My culture is higher than yours. Or my language is global; yours is local. And in order for you to know my language, you must first give up yours. The view that my god is more of a god than your god is very ungodly. This view leads some people to see their own language as inherently more of a language than other languages and therefore to insist that they themselves must be ranked higher in knowledge and power. This is what I call linguistic feudalism.All languages, large and small, have a lot to contribute to our common humanity if freed from linguistic feudalism. Education policies should be devised on the basis that all languages are treasuries of history, beauty and possibility. They have something to give to one another if their relationship is that of the give-and-take of a network. Even if one of the languages emerges as the language of communication across many languages, it should not be so on the basis of its assumed inherent nationality or globality, but on the basis of need and necessity. And even then, it should not grow on the graveyard of other languages.Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o: three days with a giant of African literatureRead moreBalanced and inclusive education calls for a new slogan: network, not hierarchy. We have to understand that all languages, big and small, have a common language: it is called translation.Education should never lead to linguistic and cultural self-isolation. I want to connect to the world, but that doesn’t mean I have to negate my starting base. I want to connect to the world from wherever I am. I believe that the goal of education is knowledge that empowers, that shows our real connections to the world, but from our base. From our base, we explore the world: from the world, we bring back that which enriches our base.That, it seems to me, is the real challenge in organising knowledge and transmitting it in an inclusive and balanced education system in the world today. We have to reject the notion that splendour is not splendour unless it springs from squalor. Palaces are not palaces unless erected on prisons. My millions are not millions unless mined from a million poor. For me to be, others must cease to be. Education must convey knowledge that empowers us to imagine more inclusive palaces, where my being enables your being and yours enables mine.Decolonizing Language and Other Revolutionary Ideasby Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o (Penguin Books, £20).

No wonder those who benefit are loth to change itPeter Apps is a contributing editor at Inside HousingTue 12 Aug 2025 09.29 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 12.19 EDTShareIn the 1970s, private landlordism in the UK was a fringe part of the market – and a dying one. With council housing plentiful and house prices within the range of those with decent, working-class jobs, we did not need private landlords. In the mid-1970s, the Conservative Policy Council had written that their decline was “quite irreversible” and that within a generation they would be “as extinct as the dinosaur”.This prediction has proved to be among the worst ever made about the UK housing market. Since then, our reliance on private landlords has exploded. They are now the first port of call for everyone in the market who cannot afford to buy: students, graduates, families, pensioners, refugees and more. There are 2.8 million private landlords in Britain – almost twice as many people as work for NHSEnglandand almost four times the UK’s entire workforce of teachers.How did we go from one extreme to the other? We chose it.In 1979 Margaret Thatcher arrived with a new vision for the country. As she defunded and sold off council housing, her plan was that the private market would take its place. A big-bang deregulation of private renting in 1988 swept away rent control and introduced short tenancies where the tenant could be evicted at the end without the landlord needing a reason.Her expectation was big, strategic investment from the corporate world – there was demand for rented housing, so there would be supply. Competition would drive up standards. The state just needed to get out of the way and let it happen. But instead, something else happened.In 1996,“buy-to-let” mortgages were launched, targeting everyman investors with a bit of spare cash. Previously, the only way to build up a property portfolio was to take out a commercial mortgage. This new product was available to anyone with a deposit, the repayments were interest only and the mortgages could be written off against tax. This came at a time when aglobal collapse of interest ratesleft lots of people without a viable pension plan, which meant it was suddenly the most obvious, and perhaps only, route to financial security.By 2001, the number of private landlords had exploded, but a survey revealed thatonly 9% of landlordssaw the profession as their full-time occupation. It was the dawn of what the lawyer and writerNick Bano terms“the small-time side hustler”.Today, we live in the wreckage of this policy failure. The thirst for investment assets has driven house prices far beyond the reach of ordinary first-time buyers, especially in big cities. Meanwhile, rents have soared – as landlords make use of Thatcher’s“no-fault evictions”to create an effective ratchet system, where they can quickly and easily evict tenants in favour of whoever can pay the most.We have some of the lowest protections for renters in the developed world, and are, according to the London School of Economics “at one end of the international spectrum on rent control” – ie the end that gives most freedom to landlords. The consequences of this are plain – people on lower incomes can no longer afford to live in the cities where they need to work; those who fall into homelessness are stuck in temporary accommodation indefinitely; and pensioners and families who cannot buy or find council housing are left without security.It is a great failure of policymakers of all parties over the past 35 years that they have simply sat back and let this happen.All of which brings me to Rushanara Ali. Thehomelessness minister resignedlast Thursday after the revelation that she had kicked tenants out of her private rental property, before putting it back on the market at a significantly increased rent. This was, in effect, a classic example of the “ratchet effect” of rent increases, and a major driver of the homelessness she is supposed to prevent.Ali resigned as minister, but retains the Labour whip and returns to the backbenches, where she will join the Labour MP for Ilford South, Jas Athwal, who was exposed last year forrenting out properties with black mouldand ant infestations.They are among83 landlord MPs in the House of Commons– a list that includes the foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. Labour has more landlords among its ranks than any other party, with 43. And this is before we get into the House of Lords – a chamber previously made up exclusively of landowners. There areat least 134 landlord peersin the upper house, although the true number is likely to be much higher – with many holding properties via a trust.All of this poses a big problem in policy terms. Listen to the landlord lobby and you would imagine that policy has turned decisively in favour of tenants in recent years, with landlords’ representative arm warning that forthcoming changes to tax, law and environmental requirements will drive 24% of its members to sell up.The legal change they are worried about is the Renters’ Rights Act, which will abolish no-fault evictions and impose tougher standards for fixing serious disrepair – in other words, attempting to tackle the behaviour of Ali and Athwal respectively.But these laws have been desperately slow coming through. They are a package of changes first announced in April 2019, under the government of Theresa May. That they took six and a half years and a change of government to finally become law owed something to the Conservative party’s fear of its backbenches, asTory MPs pushed back hardagainst the removal of no-fault evictions.We will now get the act, with royal assent likely in September and implementation from 2026. It makes steps towards a more stable, European-style rental market. That it is coming at all shows progress, and perhaps the start of a break in the dominance of the landlord influence in parliament. That it has taken so long shows the control that force has had over our politics until now.Labour does also appear likely to impose a requirement to bring private rented homes up to a moderate standard of environmental efficiency by 2030 – though this faces continual challenge and was previously scrapped by the Conservatives after landlord pressure. Rental reforms, though, remain off limits, despite support from figures outside parliament such as Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham. Labourcalled even limited rent control “cowardice”before the election.Over the past 35 years, we have dug ourselves into a pit. The dominance of the rental market by small-time side hustlers makes any reform perilous: if these landlords sell up, those who need somewhere to rent will be left in the lurch.If we want a functional housing market again, we need a long-term housing strategy that ends our reliance on side hustlers to meet complex housing needs and encourages an economy that treats homes as places to live, not an investment asset to replace a pension. But we are unlikely to ever see such a strategy when it is the side hustlers themselves entrusted to write it.Peter Apps is a contributing editor atInside Housingand the author ofShow Me the Bodies: How We Let Grenfell HappenExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionSocial housingRenting propertyHomelessnessInequalityCommunitiesEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

That’s how oftensomeone is killed or seriously injuredin a collision on the UK’s roads. Each and every one of these accidents brings an unbearable loss: for family and friends left mourning the loved ones who have been cruelly stolen from them, and survivors whose injuries can change their lives for ever. When we talk about how we make our roads safer, it’s easy to get distracted by bluff and bluster. But, every time we do, we lose sight of the most important fact: traffic accidents took over 1,600 lives last year, and we have the power to reduce and prevent them.Take speed limits.Rigorous new researchpublished by Transport for London shows the number of people killed or seriously injured on London borough roads reduced by 34% following the implementation of 20mph speed limits, with the number of children killed falling by 75% (from four to one). That means fewer grieving families and fewer people’s lives made a misery. At the same time, the predicted downsides for drivers simply haven’t materialised. Despite what their detractors might claim, 20mph speed limits haven’t actually made journeys slower because journey times are largely dictated by junction delays, not vehicle speed. Roads where 20mph speed limits apply aren’t just safer; they are quieter, too, encouraging more people to walk or cycle. Those who do drive have fewer collisions andpay lessfor their insurance as a result. It’s no surprise that residents overwhelmingly back slower speed limits in their own communities; more than three out of four of them think that 20mph is the right speed for the area they live in.Our experience isn’t isolated. The first year of a 20mph speed limit scheme in Wales led to100 fewer peoplebeing killed or seriously injured.As mayor of the capital, my approach to road safety has never been about ideology, belief, or bias; it’s about following the evidence and doing what is best. If we want to save lives, the evidence shows that there’s no time to waste. That’s why we’re rolling out 20mph speed limits on appropriate roads. Because of our policies, today half of London’s streets have 20mph speed limits. We’ve created more than 800 “school streets” across our city, cutting toxic air pollution and giving thousands of children a safer, healthier way to get to school. At the same time, we’ve increased the number ofprotected cycle routes fivefold, giving more Londoners the confidence to swap four wheels for two.Step by step, street by street, we have made the capital a better place to walk, cycle and drive. Faced with tough problems, we had the courage to come up with our own answers when the world offered none.When I launched the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), it was the first of its kind anywhere. Others have followed with similar schemes, but London’s is the largest in the world. In 2024,the year after we expanded it, levels of roadside nitrogen dioxide – the toxic gas that exacerbates asthma and raises the risk of lung cancer –declined by 27%. Since 2019, the year the scheme was first introduced, air quality has improved at 99% of monitoring sites across the capital. In a city where air pollution is linked to up to4,000 early deathsevery year, the Ulez is saving lives.It’s not just Ulez. We knew that lorries werefive times more likelyto be involved in a collision causing a fatality relative to their share of traffic. So, in 2021, we became the first place in the world to enforce adirect vision standard for lorries, forcing tens of thousands of dangerous vehicles to implement safety measures and improve how much drivers can see from their cab. Today, that standard is working; in 2023, the number of vulnerable road users killed by an HGV haddeclined by 62%from the 2017-19 baseline. The EU has since introduced a similar scheme, which it expects to save thousands of lives across the continent.When it comes to improving road safety, the record in our capital is second to none. But the truth is that, despite impressive progress, there are still too many places where higher speed limits are putting pedestrians at risk. We can and must do more, because not a single one of the tragedies that take place on the capital’s roads is inevitable. This fundamental principle – that one casualty on our roads is one too many – underpins myVision Zerofor London. By implementing it, we aim to eliminate all deaths and serious injuries on our transport network by 2041. But we will not succeed unless borough councils do their bit.Most of the capital’s boroughs have leapt at the chance to make our roads safer; 21 of them now have a default 20mph speed limit. Unfortunately, though, there are a few councils who have so far refused to play their part. In these blocker boroughs, leaders are fighting against lower speed limits on their streets. To those councils, my message is clear: it’s time to step up. Because there is nothing to be gained by playing politics with speed limits – only people to be injured and lives to be lost.Every day, I meet people who tell me they want to make even more progress to clean up our air and cut speeds on the capital’s streets. Some of them are campaigners who have dedicated their lives to making the way we travel safer and more sustainable. But the vast majority are ordinary citizens: children walking home from school; parents cycling to work; carers driving to see their relatives. What they want is simple: the freedom to go about their lives in the knowledge that they are safe from harm. For their sake, the fight for safer roads must continue.Sadiq Khan is the mayor of LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

People feel entitled to cushy jobs with fat salaries and unlimited holiday time. And by “people” I mean American politicians, who seem to treat public office as an excuse forendless vacations. Because the president and vice-president are technically always on duty, there’s no official holiday policy – and it rather feels as if they are taking advantage of this.Take the vice-president, JD “OOO (out of office)” Vance. When he’s notinspiring memesor threatening to deportmenswear influencers, he always seems to be off on a jolly. So far this year, the man has beenskiing in Vermont, shut down bits ofDisneyland for his family’s useand apparently raised thewater level of a river in Ohio for a kayaking trip. Now, the Vances aresummering in the Cotswolds.Vance, who unsuccessfully tried out for hishigh school golf team, can also occasionally be foundhitting ballswith his boss. Which is actually pretty hard work, since we all know Trump is a gifted sportsman; in April, the White House doctor cited the president’s“frequent victories in golf events”as evidence of Trump’s excellent health. And Trumpshouldbe good, considering he’s so far spent 25% of his second term golfing, according to the online trackerDid Trump Golf Today?. Lovely for him;expensive for the taxpayer.Trump was oncevery criticalof Barack Obama’s numerous golf outings. “I’m going to be working for you, I’m not going to have time to go play golf,”Trump said in 2016. He managed to find the time: a 2021 Washington Post analysis found that Trump probably played261 rounds of golfin his first term – a round every 5.6 days. This term, he’s on trackto surpass that number.Trump has alsocomplained about work-from-home policies, saying that people will take advantage and“play golf”instead. It’s different whenheplays golf, though. A workhorse like Trump can be productive anywhere!On Sunday, for example, while being driven from the White House to his golf club in Virginia, Trump (or one of his minions) snapped a few photos of homeless people, which heposted on social mediawith his typically nuanced analysis. “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump stated. “Be prepared! There will be no ‘MR. NICE GUY.’” Not everyone is capable of crafting complex policy proposals on how to reduce homelessness while being chauffeured to a tee time. It’s a skill set such as this that separates the wheat from the chaff.How did John Oliver become the moral compass of the US? |  Arwa MahdawiRead moreSpeaking of the chaff: guess how much paid time off (PTO) normies in the US are entitled to? The answer, if you’re looking at federal law,is none; it’s up to your employer. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average amount of vacation private sector workers getafter one yearat a company is 11 days. For government workers, it’s 13 days. (PTO often increases over time, but median job tenure in the US isless than five years.) What happens if you get sick and need more time off? You’d better hope that your colleagues arenice enoughtodonate their sick daysto you. By contrast, in the UK,most full-time workersare entitled to 28 days of paid annual leave from the get-go.While US vacation policy may seem miserly to outsiders, Trump thinks it’s far too generous. On Juneteenth, a holiday commemoratingthe emancipation of enslaved peoplein the US, the president complained that, despite the fact that private-sector companies don’t have to give employees the day off for federal holidays, there were too many holidays in the US and“workers don’t want it”.Like many things the president says, this is nonsense. On the contrary:Microsoft’s 2025 work index reportfound that, because of the always-on nature of technology, many workers are struggling with “infinite workdays” and burnout. How is Microsoft combating that? Glad you asked! They recently teamed up with Mercedes-Benz to bring“in-car productivity to a new level”by making it easier totake meetings while driving. Behold the American dream: nonstop work for the masses and endless golfing vacays for the guys at the top.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He also seized control of the DC municipal police department, invoking an obscure section of the 1973 D.C. Home Rule Act which allows the president to take control of local law enforcement in the district for a period of one month in times of emergency.That there is no emergency is irrelevant: Trump has declared one in order to exercise powers that are only available to him in a state of exception, which is, of course, what the whole country increasingly finds itself to be experiencing as the president expands the powers of his office from those of a constitutional executive into something more like the power of authoritarian control.The move follows the Trump administration’s deployment of both the National Guard and the Marines to Los Angeles earlier this year; in a press conference announcing the move on Monday, Trump suggested that he also intends to deploy the military to cities such as Baltimore, Oakland and New York. “This will go further,” he said. “We’re starting very strongly with DC” The deployment reflects Trump’s continued determination to further erode the longstanding American taboo against deploying military personnel for domestic law enforcement.It hardly matters what the pretext for such moves are. In LA, Trump claimed that protests against his administration’s kidnapping of immigrants was causing unsustainable disorder in the city; it wasn’t. In DC, Trump is likewise claiming that crime is out of control; it is not. (Crime has in fact dropped precipitously in Washington over the past decade, with violent crimes declining bymore than halfsince 2013; there has been an especially steep decline in the crime rate since 2023.)In a bit of dark comedy, attorney general Pam Bondi appeared at the press conference and stood at a podium to declare that crime in DC would soon come to an end, all while flanked by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and President Trump, two men accused – and, in Trump’s case, convicted – of numerous crimes themselves.But no one is really supposed to believe that the deployment of troops to America’s most liberal, most racially diverse, and most culturally thriving cities is an actual response to an actual crisis. Rather, the thinness of the pretext is itself a demonstration of power. The Trump administration, and national Republicans more broadly, have increasingly been willing to argue that Democratic rule is illegitimate even where Democratic politicians are duly elected; the nationalization of law enforcement in DC follows from this premise, seizing authority that rightly belongs to the Democratic local officials and distributing it to the Republican national figures who will brook no disagreement and tolerate no imposition of policies with which they disagree.Such a move may not, in the end, lead to widespread violence: aside from the lack of much actual crime for them to respond to, the capital is unbearably hot in the summertime, and one imagines sleepy-looking National Guard troops wandering aimlessly around the National Mall in the August swamp heat, wilted and sweaty in their tactical gear. But the imposition should, in a country with sufficient civic virtue, spawn mass protests all the same.The troops, after all, are not there to solve a real problem; there is no actual crisis for Trump to exploit. They are there, instead, because the president wants to send a message: that cities and states that are not sufficiently deferential to him in law will have his will imposed on them by force. The result is the same politics of shakedown and threat that Trump has wielded so successfully againstuniversitiesandmajor businesses: he will impose suffering on anyone who does not defer to his will.One strange facet of the Trump era is the continually receding horizon of terms like “dictatorship” and “authoritarianism.” Is it an “authoritarian” move for Trump to seize control of the DC police force if a statute technically grants him the legal authority to do so? Is it a “dictatorship” if the mechanisms used to extend presidential control into things like private university admissions policies partakes of the nominal consent of administrators?Is it really a collapsed democracy if the soldiers marching down the streets of the capitol haven’t actually wound up shooting anyone yet? These are the kinds of questions that sound ridiculous and naïve when you say them out loud; they sound like the kind of excuse-making one engages in when the effort to maintain denial has become desperate. They are also, often, debates involving the sort of semantic questions that are a bad sign when they come up at all: if the answer was good, no one would be asking the question.But the militarization of DC also illustrates a core feature of fascist regimes, which is their collapse of rhetoric and reality. Symbolism, language, images: these are core to Trump’s political project, which is as much mythic as it is material. Trump’s claims about crime and disorder are plain lies. But the ability to make your lies have the force of fact is a terrifying power. No one can doubt that Trump has seized it.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Holding cardboard signs drawn in bright felt-tip pen (“save our kids”), the “pink protest” marched under the banner of protecting women and girls.The crowd may have looked a novel sight, but it points to a rationale that is increasingly gaining ground this summer: asylum seekers are a danger to British women and girls.While the hundreds of protesters across the country – both peaceful and violent – share different motivations, there is a consistent sense that “foreigners” are a threat at best economically and culturally, and at worst physically and sexually. Theongoing unrestoutside the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex was first sparked after an Ethiopian asylum seeker was charged with the alleged sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl, an accusationhe has formally denied. Look at any of the towns and cities that have since seen protests – from Newcastle toBallymena– and the far right, already having hijacked anger over the Rotherham grooming gangs scandal, are organising online underslogans such as“For our children, for our future”. Within days of the first Canary Wharf march, a group in Hampshire announcedtheir own “pink protest”for – as they tweeted – “the safety of women and children in the community”.Such ideas are not consigned to the fringes of the far right or a few local groups: they are being employed – and encouraged – by mainstream news outlets and politicians. As the new wave of protests kicked off, the Mail on Sunday ran an investigation into the number of asylum seekers who “have repaid the generosity of British taxpayers by committing serious offences”, including rape and sexual assault.Such exposés have quickly widened from targeting men on “small boats” to migrants generally, with the two groups often blurred. The Times recently ran a front page warning one in eight prisoners are now born overseas, with the number convicted of sexual and violent crimes increasing. That the data shows that one in six residents of England and Wales areborn outside the UK– and therefore migrants are actually underrepresented in prisons, despite being more likely to be held on remand – was, funnily enough, not mentioned.View image in fullscreenMeanwhile, the Conservatives and Reform UK are increasingly confident in linking immigration to crime. On Sunday, shadow justice secretaryRobert Jenrick saidasylum seekers with “medieval attitudes” coming to Britain mean he is afraid for the safety of his three young daughters. Last month, Nigel Farage explicitly claimed increased migrationwas responsiblefor a rise in the number of rapes and sexual assaults in the UK, pointing to arrivals from – as he put it – “countries in which women aren’t even second-class citizens”. It seems those so-calledlegitimate concernsnow include the fear that asylum seekers are coming over here to rape our women and girls.It would be easy for the government to dispel such myths by making the facts around sexual violence clear. But when I asked the Home Office if it collects data on criminal offences by asylum seekers, it declined to provide any formal comment. When I asked the Home Office if it would like to put on record that – as was confirmed to me by several refugee and women’s charities – there are no official figures that show asylum seekers are more likely to commit sexual offences than British nationals, it did not respond. It was, however, keen to stress it has just released data about foreign nationals (a term that includes many others who are not asylum seekers) in prisons.This ambiguity – and outright radio silence – is unhelpful to say the least, but it is also a choice. Tim Naor Hilton, the chief executive of Refugee Action, outlined the facts in black and white. “There is no clear or credible evidence that people seeking asylum commit more crimes, and any data suggesting that must be viewed in the context of systemic bias, including in policing.”Ministers could say the same, but they do not. The net effect is a vacuum that bad actors are left to fill with bigotry andmisinformation, conflating asylum, migration and criminality to falsely portray asylum seekers – many of whom will be victims of abuse and torture themselves – as a potential danger to the British people. Just look to Warwickshire, where the leader of the Reform-led county council isaccusing policeof a “cover up” over the immigration status of two men charged with the alleged rape of a local child (police vehemently deny that). The vacuum always gets filled: on Saturday, the far rightmarched outside council offices in Nuneaton, with crowds shouting officers were “protecting paedophiles”.What we are seeing is in many ways an extension of the centuries-old racial prejudice that ethnic minorities are a sexual threat to white females (and the white males who claim possession of them). But it is also part of a wider negative depiction of asylum seekers – a narrative that says they are dishonest, greedy and criminal. Think of the spurious stories that child refugees are, in fact, devious adultspretending to be children. Is it any wonder a new YouGov poll shows nearly half of Britons wrongly believe thatillegal migrants now outnumberthose here legally? The same forces that wish to disproportionately associate asylum seekers or migrants with sexual assaults have quite successfully sold the lie that they have already committed a crime by being in the country.Just as we saw with the unrest after the Southport murders last summer, all of this not only inflames racial tensions – it distracts from the very real epidemic of gender-based violence. Few of the politicians or pundits concerned about so-called small boat “perverts” ever mention the crisis of, say,rape trial backlogsor funding cuts for domestic violence refuges. Some protesters will feel genuine worry for the safety of local women. For others, tackling male violence is only desirable if those males are migrants or asylum seekers. Indeed, many involved in the Southport disturbances were perpetrators themselves: two in five people arrested for last year’s riots hadpreviously been reported for domestic violence.There is no clear way out of this when the two main parties are busy in a race to the bottom: as of this week, Labour is pondering letting police release theethnicity or immigration statusof criminal suspects, while the Conservatives have suggested authorities should “swab and track” asylum seekers arriving on small boats – effectively storing their DNA on the assumption they may commit crimes in the future.It feels a dark kind of summer, in which prejudice is dressed in fuchsia and the political class shrug their shoulders while the angry mob grows. We are often told that newcomers to these shores refuse to adopt “British values”, but perhaps those stoking the public’s worst instincts can remember one themselves: in this country, people are innocent until proven guilty. That includes asylum seekers too.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist. She is the author ofWho Wants Normal?

Scepticism about a wealth tax is rising, but there are many ways to skin fat catsTue 12 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 06.01 EDTShareParoxysms of glee among Labour’s many enemies greeted last week’s forecast of a£41.2bn black holeawaiting Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget, from influential thinktank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). Expect another three months of bone-rattling warnings about imminent tax raids crushing every family. She is in a doom loop; no way out; ha, ha, ha!Voices in the Treasury sound sanguine, pointing out that NIESR has a record of eccentric forecasts. Before the spring statement, it predicted that Reevesneeded £57bnjust to keep her fiscal rules: actually, it was £4.1bn. For Jeremy Hunt as chancellor in 2023, it generously forecast he had£97.5bn to spend: on the day, that had shrunk to £6.5bn.But the truth universally acknowledged (if not publicly by the government) is that taxes must rise. Debt interest costs £100bn a year, growth is nowhere near enough for rising NHS, pensions and welfare costs. Even the right talks of a “brutally honest conversation with the public”: that’s from Robert Colvile, the director of the Centre for Policy Studies, daring to come up withsolutions that would sinkhis party at an election: “No more triple lock. Raising the state pension age … Asking people to pay for their social care out of their housing wealth.” (Quite right, but toxic in Torydom.)Even more surprising, the director of the rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), Tom Clougherty, advocates a tax rise:ending VAT exemptionsto almost double the intake. TheInstitute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) agrees, and has suggested using the billions raised to generously compensate all lower-income households for their extra shopping costs. The IEA would compensate the losers, but spend the rest on cutting income tax. Counterintuitively, the great bulk of these untargeted VAT exemptions reward highest spenders – Waitrose not Iceland shoppers.There is a new honesty about tax and spend among the serious. Hunting for easy money is becoming a national game. The rising clamour for wealth taxes springs from what everyone knows: the rich have gained monstrously from an economy that propels the upward redistribution of wealth. The 50 wealthiest UK families ownmore than the poorest halfof the population, says a report from the Equality Trust. Much billionaire wealth comes from the ownership of property and financial assets, not “entrepreneurial spirit”, inflated deliberately by a decade of quantitative easing. The inheritocracy dominates.Time to reach in and take some back. TheTax Justice Networkwants a 2% levy on wealth over £10m, raising £24bn a year, strongly backed byOxfam,Dale Vinceand thePatriotic Millionaires UKcampaign. The publicagrees, by 75% to 13% against. Naturally, the great wealth-protection machine is in overdrive. The consultancy Henley & Partners claims that 16,500 UK millionaires are fleeing, quoted everywhere as gospel truth, but has beencomprehensively questionedin a thorough report by Dan Neidle of Tax Policy Associates. Henley is a company thatfacilitates citizenship and residencyfor a wealthy clientele. But the narrative is out there: Labour has caused a tax flight.However, Neidle, no rightwinger,issues warningsabout wealth taxes. Wealth is now grotesquely agglomerated among very, very few, so 80% of wealth tax revenue would come from just 5,000 people and 15% from just 10 people. That makes the tax “uniquely vulnerable” to a handful who are gaming valuations or quitting Britain. Unless every country did it, he warns a regular levy would deter inward investors. The IFS isequally sceptical. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, rudely dismisses the whole idea as “daft”.The gambling industry is a licence to print money. Tax it properly – and turbocharge the fight against child poverty | Gordon BrownRead moreDoes that mean it’s dead? Not necessarily, as otherLabourfigures, talking to the Treasury team, put forward ideas privately that have wind in their sails. An instant retrospective wealth-tax raid to raise money urgently for that 5% GDP pledged for national defence has backing, I hear from those talking to the Treasury. Demanding a one-off whack for the defence of the realm could be popular and practicable. What’s more, howls of protest from the wealthy would help rebrand Labour usefully as both socially just and patriotic.There are many ways to skin fat cats, using existing taxes. Here isthe listfrom the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation: the big tax-raisers are £16.7bn from equalising capital gains and income tax rates, treating all income the same. But look how craftily the rich defend themselves: private equity lobbyingjust wona very quiet reprieve to keep disguising earned income as low-taxed capital gain. Running rings around the taxman, someescape inheritance taxon precious art works by promising to make them accessible to the public and then failing; some have even been sold. At least Labour ishiring 5,000 HMRC staff, cut by the Tories despite collecting many multiples of their salaries.Everyone needs the services that national insurance symbolises: it should be paid on all incomes, for landlords, shareholders and investments. Nor will taxing the rich be enough: income tax can’t be taboo, never raised since Denis Healey in 1975, as “drastic times call for drastic action”, writes Paul Johnson, the recently departed IFS director. Property is grossly undertaxed: be brave and reform council tax into a fairer land-value tax.What is certain is that promises will be broken, taxes raised and the faux row will be equally ear-splitting whether Reeves takes a lot or a little. So go for radicalism; the country needs it – for defence, health, old age, decayed infrastructure and green power. Roll the pitch now, prepare the way, and change the moral climate on the tax deniers and avoiders.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTax and spendingOpinionLabourRachel ReevesThe super-richcommentShareReuse this content"

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)warned last monthof acute danger to the 28-year-old’s life as the Israel Defense Forces stepped up online attacks on him. These were not merely smears, but a death threat in response to his coverage, the Al Jazeera reporter said. And now he is dead, one of five media workerskilled in an airstrikeon Sunday.The CPJ says thatmore than 180 Palestinian journalists and media workershave been killed in almost two years of war – more than the number who have died globally in the previous three years. This does not merely reflect Gaza’s vast death toll – 61,599, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry and many more if independent experts are correct. Nor does it merely reflect the courage shown by reporters, photographers, camera operators and others in a war zone. The CPJ says 26 of the reporters were targeted.Israeli officials have bragged of killing Mr Sharif, whom they have claimed was the head of a Hamas terrorist cell, planning rocket attacks against Israeli civilians. Mr Sharif and Al Jazeera had already denied this. It would surely be hard for such a prominent figure to combine reporting with command of such a unit. The documents offered up by Israel as evidence end two years before the war began, and were reportedlyscreen grabs of electronic spreadsheets, not independently verified.Israeli officials have repeatedly offered wildly misleading and rapidly shifting accounts of events, includingthe killing of paramedics in Gazathis spring. In 2023, an IDF general reportedly told American officials within hours thatone of its soldiers had probably shot deadthe acclaimed Palestinian-AmericanAl Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Aklehin the occupied West Bank – but Israeli officials insisted publicly that Palestinian militants were to blame. No justification has even been attempted for the deaths of Mr Sharif’s colleagues.Mr Sharif’s 90-year-old father was killed in an airstrike on their home in late 2023, after Israeli military officials called the journalist telling him to stop reporting and leave Gaza. Israeli claims that he was a Hamas fighter resurfaced last month after hisemotional reporting on starvationwent viral. He was killed as outrage mounted over Gaza’s famine and shortly after Israelannounced its plan to launch a groundoffensive in Gaza City, which would only deepen the catastrophe and is reportedly opposed by many in the military too. The deaths of the Al Jazeera team in the city ensure few are left to bear witness to what unfolds. International correspondents are unable to enter Gaza except on escorted military trips during which they cannot speak to Palestinians.Sheltered by the US, Israel’s government appears unmoved as international public opinion turns against it andeven staunch allies blenchat the horrors of Gaza. The Al Jazeera killings have been widely and rightly condemned. The Reporters sans Frontières group has alsourged the international criminal courtto investigate the treatment of media workers.“If these words reach you, know that Israel has succeeded in killing me and silencing my voice,” Mr Sharifwrotein a posthumously published statement. Deliberately targeting journalists is a war crime: an assault not only on the person, but on truth itself. Yet it cannot disguise Israel’s other atrocities. Rather, it adds to the charge sheet against its leaders.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But for low earners, the cost of living crisis endures – with food and rent inflation erasing any pay gainsTue 12 Aug 2025 13.41 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareWhen Sir Keir Starmer told reporterslast weekthat his government’s upcoming budget would “build on what we’ve done” by focusing on “living standards” and “making sure that people feel better off”, it was clear that he was trying to shift the political narrative from soulless statistics to lived experience.But if the prime minister is serious, he should look at thelatest forecastfrom the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). The thinktank warns that while some households may indeed “feel better off”, many – particularly the poorest – will not. NIESR says real disposable income for the bottom tenth of households will fall this year. Living standards for the poorest fifth of Britain are well below their pre-pandemic level.This analysis rather deflates Treasury ministers’claimsthat real wages under Labour had risen more in 10 months than they had in the 10 previous years of Conservative government. This political attack line might be arithmetically sound, but to make it stick requires a generous statistical interpretation. What ministers have done is go back to the post-2010 austerity years, when real wages slumped after the financial crisis.Criticson social media have warned against cherrypicking time periods. They say real pay climbed gradually between 2015 and 2019 in the UK, but dropped again during the twin inflation shocks of Covid and the Ukraine war, before rebounding sharply after 2023. Ministers are scoring political points – but these are cheap given that there have been, so far, no significant changes in industrial policy, collective bargaining or public spending.In fact, real wage gains under Labour have been modest.Average weekly earnings in real termswere £523 last July and £527 thisJune– an increase of less than 1%. Hardly a new dawn for workers. More troubling is the distribution – which is masked by the use of average figures. Strong wage growth, says NIESR, has been concentrated in the tech and public sectors, where low‑paid workers are underrepresented. Above-inflation increases in minimum wage haven’t compensated for reductions in working hours. No surprise then that the thinktank’s data shows that middle- and upper-income households are seeing improvements in living standards, while thepoorestare falling further behind. For these households, costs such as food and rent are rising faster than incomes. They won’t feel better off – because they aren’t.The upshot is that real personal disposable income rose by 4.1% in 2024-25, but the gains went almost entirely to better-off households. Today’s unemployment figures show four-fifths of recent job losses concentrated inretail and hospitality– sectors that employ large numbers of low-paid workers. Clearly, for low-income families, the cost of living crisis has not abated. NIESR warns ministers to act – or risk letting the poorest slide into destitution.The country’s problem lies in its imbalances. For many Britons, the modest post-pandemic recovery in real incomes has come about largely because inflation fell. But productivity growth remains anaemic, and the underlying economic model – which isfinancialised, service-heavy andregionally lopsided– is widening inequalities. If the next budget fails to offer anything more than supply-side tweaks or fiscal restraint in the name of credibility, Sir Keir will find that “building on what we’ve done” is not enough. For the poorest Britons, what’s been done so far doesn’t look much like progress at all.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus a letter fromPaula JonesTue 12 Aug 2025 12.38 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 12.41 EDTShareLord Falconer’s assessment of the government (Starmer’s team seen as ‘tired, same-again politicians’, says Labour peer, 9 August) does not acknowledge the depth of feeling on current issues, and his advice for the future is itself “same-again” and “tired”. After the last general election, Keir Starmerpromised us hopeand an assurance that the “broadest shoulders” would help to turn around the country after 14 years of disastrous and deeply damaging Conservative rule.However, the public clearly didn’t think thataxing disabled people’s benefitsor removing heating allowances from pensioners fitted the “broadest shoulders” definition. Rather large “fuck-ups”, as Falconer puts it, in a handful of weeks. The pro-Israel, pro-US foreign policy agenda, while a terrible genocide unfolds in Gaza, has also proved deeply unpalatable.The public feel duped and insulted by this “blue”Labourgovernment, with its unashamedly authoritarian assault on democracy. I agree with the “same old, same old” sentiment: same lower- and middle-income earners paying the same price for the same old financiers, political lobbyists, rightwing campaign groups, global corporations, arms manufacturers and their vested interests.Yes, the10-year NHS planis welcome, but the failure to tax the super-rich and initiatives such as the environmentally catastrophic planning reforms outweigh any positive steps. Falconer suggests No 10 should unapologetically drive through ideological change, but that approach is doomed. Less of the tone-deafness and failure to read the room, and more consultation, more humanity, are what the people want.Sue BorgesStowmarket, SuffolkCharles Falconer’s critique of Labour in government sums up the situation very well. I would just add that disillusionment and absence of hope combine to make this an unhappy, uneasy country. Yet our government apparently fails to see any link with increasing polarisation, conflict and crime. It’s proving a costly failure for us all, but especially for the people who are marginalised and vulnerable.

All the more surprising, then, that she overlooks some of the more promising steps towards nuclear disarmament.In particular, momentum is building behind the UN treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, which came into force in 2021 and is now supported by nearly half the countries in the world. The treaty was the focus of much of the debate in Hiroshima, where I attended the 80th anniversary commemorations, and it deserves to be much better known.How disappointing, then, that the UK government is not only failing to support it but is actively trying to suppress information about the impact of nuclear war as one of justthree countries to vote againstthe creation of a UN scientific panel on its effects. Instead, it’s choosing to accept a recommendation from the recent strategic defence review to run a PR campaign to convince people of the “necessity” of a growing nuclear arsenal.If we are to have any success in challenging this, we need to promote a public education campaign that sets out the existential threat posed by nuclear weapons, the flaws in so-called deterrence theory and measures that could immediately reduce risk – taking weapons off hair-trigger alert, for example, and joining China in a “no first use” policy.Recent polling from More in Common suggests that young people believe nuclear conflict is the greatest threat to Britain. We owe it to them not to give up.Caroline LucasVice-president,Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament; former Green party MPI normally agree with Polly Toynbee, and was also on the Aldermaston marches as a child, but she is misguided in believing that a joint European nuclear capability would make us safer from Russian aggression. If Russian tanks were to roll into Poland, does she envisage Europe threatening to take out Moscow? If so, I hope that it would be an empty threat and hence useless; if a real threat, we are on the road to Armageddon.Maybe it would deter a nuclear attack or threat, but is such a situation conceivable? After all, Vladimir Putin could launch a nuclear attack on Ukraine, which has no nuclear umbrella. The more places that have such weapons, the more the risk of misjudged situations. In practice, the nuclear option is useless, unsafe and costly, as well as immoral.Gerry WestonWillesden Green, LondonThe dangerous myth that the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima ended the Pacific war is perpetuated in all the coverage of its 80th anniversary. When I attended an intensive summer course with my students, organised by Hiroshima City University in 2005, we discussed the evidence against this contention. Subsequently, Tsuyoshi Hasegawa, in his book Racing the Enemy: Stalin, Truman, and the Surrender of Japan, laid out the overwhelming evidence that it was the Soviet entry into the war that finally forced the surrender.Nuclear weaponskill people and may destroy the planet – they do not end war.Michael NewmanEmeritus professor, London Metropolitan UniversityHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, focusing on peak economic growth misses the bigger picture and underestimates China in ways that could weaken western policy responses. China’s central goal is national power, and we are far from its peak national power.The Chinese economic miracle has taken place under the US-led global system.Chinabuilt factories along its coast, filled container ships, and sent its goods to developed markets, effectively plugging into an existing network of shipping routes, ports and railways. However, just as easily as China joined this system, so too can it be forcefully unplugged.This is a core national security concern and, for more than a decade, China has been building an alternative to this US-led order. The belt and road initiative has created new trading networks across the global south; the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (Cips) allows China and its partners to move money beyond the gaze of the US government; the “Made in China 2025” policy has established China as a global leader in science and technology; and the modernisation of its military will allow China to project power beyond its borders.On his first and only visit to the US since the pandemic, Xi Jinping declared to Joe Biden that “Planet Earth is big enough for the two countries to succeed”. Policymakers should understand this as a statement of intent. Even with slower growth, the party commands enough of the nation’s wealth and resources to pursue its ultimate aim: a parallel, China-led global system.Andrew J SinclairVisiting assistant professor of finance, California Institute of TechnologyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

As if the Sweden striker’s decision to skip the club’s tour of Singapore and South Korea while trying to force a move to Liverpool was not bad enough, a succession of transfer targets have turned Newcastle down.Hugo Ekitiké, Bryan Mbeumo, João Pedro, James Trafford andBenjamin Sesko optedto move to Liverpool, London or Manchester as the majority Saudi Arabian-owned club operated without a sporting director and chief executive. The good news is that Eddie Howe is an excellent coach and possesses plenty of high-calibre players, Sandro Tonali, Bruno Guimarães, Anthony Elanga, Joelinton and Anthony Gordon foremost among them. Throw in the arrivals of Anthony Elanga, Aaron Ramsdale and, almost certainly,Malick Thiawand last season’s starting XI has been fortified in goal, central defence and on the right wing.The need for a couple of strikers and, above all, a resolution to Isak’s flirtation with Liverpool remains pressing. Howe’s admission that he “wants players that really want to play for this football club” suggests the manager has had enough of Isak but much depends on the expected impending financial haggling between Newcastle’s owners and the Anfield board. Meanwhile Newcastle have failed to win a pre-season fixture. “It’s been achallenging summer,” Howe reflected. “But any season can go one of two ways. Things are never as good or as bad as you think. At the moment I’m very neutral. I believe that from tough moments you can build something even more special than you had before.”How Newcastle finished in the past five seasonsThe managerAny concerns that Howe could flounder away from his south-coast comfort zone have been well and truly banished during the near four years the former Bournemouth manager has spent on Tyneside. The workaholic 47-year-old is an outstanding coach who, in the course of leading Newcastle into the Champions League for the second time in three seasons and choreographing the Carabao Cup triumph, has improved a series of players beyond measure. Joelinton’s startling metamorphosis from struggling centre-forward to gamechanging midfielder is testament to Howe’s talents. Although an excellent, highly articulate communicator, Newcastle’s piano-playing manager does not dispense trust easily and, publicly at least, is a master of circumspection.Off-field pictureDespite the gargantuan wealth of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Newcastle’s relatively skinny commercial revenue streams dictate their spending is restricted by Premier League profitability and sustainability rules. Fans, and some players, are frustrated by the Saudis’ failure to deliver a new training ground, and a decision as to whether to revamp St James’ Park or build a new stadium keeps being postponed. It does not help that the club have spent the past 11 months seeking a new chief executive after the outgoing Darren Eales’s blood cancer diagnosis and have been without a sporting director this summer in the wake of Paul Mitchell’s abrupt exit in June, after less than a year in the job. Since the ousting of the former minority owner Amanda Staveley and her husband, Mehrdad Ghodoussi, last summer the lack of an Arabist and/or an executive conversant with Saudi business culture in Newcastle’s UK hierarchy has created an apparent disconnect.Last season’s resultsStar signingThe £55m signing of Elanga from Nottingham Forest ends Howe’s long-running quest for a new right winger. “I want to showcase my talent,” says the rapid-dribbling 23-year-old Sweden international. “I’m pacey and direct. I can play on either side, I can play as a striker. I can use both feet. I’ve got lots of weapons. I know the gaffer and staff here can take my game to another level. What we want to achieve, how we want to play, it’s perfect. What we’re building here is unique and special. As soon as I knew about Newcastle’s interest it was a no brainer.” Howe has long been impressed by a player whose solitary work on his left foot during lockdown has left Elanga two-footed. “I’ve got a saying where I’m precise, not rushed,” says the former Manchester United winger. “It’s a French saying, precis pas précipité, something I go by a lot. In my life, I’ve never rushed anything.”View image in fullscreenAnthony Elanga has said it was a ‘no brainer’ to join Newcastle this summer.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAStepping upLewis Miley is 19 but looks very much the complete midfielder and holds two England Under-21 caps. After breaking into Newcastle’s first team during the 2023-24 campaign, a 6ft 2in player with an eye for goal, equally at home in a defensive or attacking midfield role, was restricted to 14 appearances last season. If a back injury was partly responsible, the best youngster to emerge from Newcastle’s academy for a very long time faced stiff completion from Tonali, Guimarães and Joelinton for a starting spot in Howe’s midfield trinity. The demands of a Champions League campaign should create more opportunities this term when Miley can show he is capable of providing real competition for Guimarães and co.A big season for …At 27 Aaron Ramsdale has suffered three relegations from the Premier League (with Bournemouth, Sheffield United and Southampton), been bought by Arsenal for £30m and won five England caps. He joins on loan from Southampton and will compete with Nick Pope for a starting place. Howe, Ramsdale’s old Bournemouth manager, admires his footwork and regards his former protege as the sort of goalkeeper needed to advance Newcastle’s stylistic evolution. But is Ramsdale really a better all-round keeper than Pope? Can he recapture the form that once made him Arsenal’s first choice? And can he assuage Newcastle’s disappointment at seeing Manchester City hijack their move for Trafford, the gifted former Burnley goalkeeper?Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26Newcastle UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He took a week off from practice and holidayed in El Puerto de Santa Maria, in southern Spain, before two weeks training at home in El Palmar, Murcia.“When I’m off, I’m off,” he said. “I don’t step in the gym at all. A lot of times if we go for a trip, sometimes my friends go to the gym. The first week that I had off I just told them: ‘I’m gonna join you for a little run.’ But then I woke up and I said: ‘Go, and I’m going to keep sleeping.’”Medjedovic presented a genuine challenge for Alcaraz. A winner at the Next Gen ATP Finals in 2023, two years after Alcaraz’s victory there, the 22-year-old is armed with a big serve and an enormous forehand. However, his footwork, conditioning and intensity are all lacking at the highest level. With the exception of a brief blip in the second set, where he momentarily lost his serve, Alcaraz played a solid match and he continually exposed Medjedovic’s movement as he marched into the fourth round.“I know he’s a really powerful player,” Alcaraz said after his 50th victory of the year, which gives him four consecutive seasons with 50-plus wins. That hasn’t happened on the ATP Tour since Novak Djokovic accomplished the feat in 2013-16. “His shots are incredibly hard to return. He has a big serve also. I know he doesn’t like to run too much from side to side, so my plan was to make him run as much as I could.“It was difficult because his ball flies and it comes really fast, but I’m just glad that I did it most of the time, tried to defend in a good way. I’m just really happy to get the win.”Alcaraz will next face Luca Nardi, a lucky loser, after the 16th seed Jakub Mensik became the latest player to suffer in the heat, retiring from his third-round match against Nardi when trailing 6-2, 2-1. In the women’s draw Coco Gauff advanced to the fourth round after a walkover against Dayana Yastremska, the 32nd seed, who withdrew on Tuesday due to illness.Explore more on these topicsCarlos AlcarazTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Recent entrants to the Football League, this meeting with Ipswich was just their secondCarabao Cupcontest – now they have their first victory, delivered on penalties against a side who were in the top tier three months ago.After Ben Johnson cancelled out Deji Elerewe’s first-half opener forBromley, the game went to sudden death and the night belonged to Sam Long. He saved Ipswich’s first penalty, low to his right off George Hirst, and was required for another, denying Ali Al-Hamadi, once a Bromley player. Marcus Ifill slotted in for the final blow. It proved to be a memorable moment for a club not short of them in recent years.Champions League qualifying and Carabao Cup first round: football – as it happenedRead more“Show them a level of respect but don’t roll over and just say: ‘Come in here and nick all our crown jewels and go home with the win,’” the Bromley manager, Andy Woodman, said in explaining his pre‑game instructions.“Let’s go out there and give an account of ourselves. I’m probably not a household name as a manager, but my team and me, we work our socks off to cover everything. And my team represents me very well.”This game brought together two managers who are 15 years and two divisions apart but with similar stories to tell. Kieran McKenna and Woodman joined their respective clubs in 2021, leaving behind the luxury of the Premier League; McKenna departed Manchester United’s staff, Woodman was head of goalkeeping at Arsenal.Both have packed plenty of history in the past four years, McKenna most notably with back-to-back promotions; Woodman with his side’s ascension into the Football League last year, a first for the club founded in 1892. The 3G pitch at Hayes Lane was subsequently ripped out and replaced by grass to fulfil league requirements, symbolic for a club wanting more.View image in fullscreenBen Johnson equalised for Ipswich after Bromley’s Deji Elerewe had opened the scoring in the first half.Photograph: John Walton/PABromley finished last season four points off the League Two playoffs and reached the third round of the FA Cup for the first time, even taking the lead at St James’ Park before Newcastle won 3-1. Ipswich, days after anintense Championship opener with Birmingham, were well positioned for a serious scare.Bromley’s special occasion was not to get in the way of rotation, both sides much changed from their last outings. Michael Cheek, the leading goalscorer in League Two last season, was left on the home bench. McKenna handed a first Ipswich start to Ashley Young, older than his manager but still up for a trek down the right. He eased through the first half as Ipswich dominated possession but failed to create.Jack Clarke was lively when cutting in from the left; the overlapping Leif Davis enjoyed the space created and launched his cutbacks. But they could not get past the Bromley centre-half Omar Sowunmi, towering over Al-Hamadi and in control at the back. Fittingly, Sowunmi was key at the other end, too. Leaping high from a corner just before half-time, he headed into the middle for Elerewe, who glanced in to prompt the roar.Quick GuideChampionship outfits stunned in Carabao CupShowDoncastercontinued their dream start to the season as they stunned Championship sideMiddlesbrough4-0 at the Riverside to book their place in the Carabao Cup second round.Rovers took the lead in the 11th minute when Boro were made to pay for cheaply conceding possession in their own half. Jordan Gibson found Billy Sharp in the box and the experienced striker teed up Ben Close, whose shot deflected in off defender George McCormick.Doncaster doubled their lead in the 23rd minute thanks to another heavy deflection, with Boro defender Alfie Jones diverting Damola Ajayi’s shot from inside the box beyond goalkeeper Tom Glover. Robbie Gotts fired in the third from outside the box six minutes from time, before Tom Nixon curled in the fourth deep in stoppage time.Bradfordscored twice in the first four minutes to shockBlackburn2-1 in the tie at Ewood Park. Graham Alexander’s newly promoted Bradford stunned their Championship hosts  with a lightning start, as Ibou Touray slammed in a sumptuous volley with barely 90 seconds gone.It got worse two minutes later when Blackburn’s debutant goalkeeper Nick Michalski lost control of the ball outside the area under pressure, leaving Will Swan with an empty net.Michalski had to be alert to deny Swan a second before Rovers grabbed a lifeline on the stroke of half-time when Dion De Neve controlled a long throw and rifled in expertly from six yards but Bradford held on.Wrexham, meanwhile, staged a dramatic late comeback to snatch a place in the second round on penalties after a 3-3 draw withHull. Veteran striker Ollie Palmer put doubt over his future aside with two headed goals in stoppage time to take a pulsating encounter at the Racecourse to a shootout.The hosts prevailed 5-3 on penalties after Joel Ndala hit the crossbar for Hull. Wrexham had led after 31 minutes through Elliot Lee but looked like going out as Hull hit back through Oli McBurnie, Ndala and Matt Crooks.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There was more joy for Bromley supporters after the break as Cheek came on under lights, ready to hassle up top. Ipswich, nonetheless, went level through a half-time change of their own. Chiedozie Ogbene thundered down the right wing before Conor Chaplin seized on the cross, his close-range volley tipped on to the crossbar by Long. But Johnson’s arrival into the box was perfectly timed, the rebound slotted in.Bromley came close when Marcus Dinanga was denied inside the area by Christian Walton as the game turned more frenetic around the hour. But the net refused to bustle, with Al-Hamadi and Ifill going close in the dying exchanges. The latter had his moment not long after.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupBromleyIpswich Townmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

TheLigue 1winners appear to have signed his replacement in the highly-rated Lucas Chevalier, who joined from Lille last week. Luis Enrique emphasised that the decision to leave Donnarumma behind, and seemingly end his PSG career, had been a technical one.Tottenham leave Bissouma out of Super Cup squad due to persistent latenessRead more“These are always difficult decisions to make,” he said. “I can definitely talk about Gigi, because he’s one of the best players in his position, without a doubt. He’s even better as a person. We’re looking for a goalkeeping profile that is different to Donnarumma. It’s always difficult to make the decision in these kinds of situations. My decision is a decision that’s been taken, it’s been supported by my club.”Donnarumma offered his own perspective in an Instagram post that suggested his manager’s view was not shared. “Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team’s success,” a section of it read. “I am disappointed and disheartened. I hope I have the opportunity to look the fans at the Parc des Princes in the eyes one more time and say goodbye as it should be done. If that doesn’t happen, I want you to know that your support and affection mean the world to me, and I will never forget it.”Even though Luis Enrique appeared to be implying that Donnarumma’s ability on the ball required improving on, a clamour for the 26-year-old’s services is expected in England and beyond. He has made 74 appearances for his country, winning Euro 2020, and has won four Ligue 1 titles since joining PSG from AC Milan in 2021. Premier League clubs will be on high alert for a player who has entered the last year of his contract and could be available at a cut price.“If we are champions of Europe, we owe him a lot,” said the PSG captain, Marquinhos. “He is part of this history and always will be. We’re so proud of what he’s done, we thank him from the bottom of our hearts. We don’t know if he’s staying or going yet and if he’s staying we welcome him with open arms.”View image in fullscreenIllia Zabarnyi joins PSG after making 86 appearances for Bournemouth.Photograph: PSGPSG hope to back up their thrashing of Inter in Munich by defeating the Europa League winners Tottenham.

However, he withdrew from the US track and field trials in July, writing on X: “Taking some time out to get back on track. The 100m should be a straight sprint. 2025 has presented many hurdles.

His statistics, while still impressive, back that up when considering the standard Kelce set in his previous seven Pro Bowl seasons.As the world knows, Kelce’s life has been in a brighter spotlight given his highly publicized relationship withTaylor Swift– you’ve likely heard of her – and a slate of off-field ventures. The 35-year-old has hosted Saturday Night Live, landed a role in Ryan Murphy’s Grotesquerie, appeared in Happy Gilmore 2 alongside Adam Sandler, and taken on a hosting gig for Amazon’s Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? He also keeps busy with the New Heights podcast he co-hosts with his brother, Jason, where Swift this week announced her new album.To that respect, the certain future Pro Football Hall of Famer told GQin a cover story released Tuesdaythat some of those pursuits may have impacted his play.“I think it might have slipped a little bit because I did have a little bit more focus in trying to set myself up,” Kelce said. “And opportunities came up where I was excited to venture into a new world of acting and being an entertainer.”He was quick to stress he doesn’t regret taking on those opportunities. “I don’t say this as ‘I shouldn’t have done it,’” Kelce said. “I’m just saying that my work ethic is such that I have so much pride in how I do things that I never want the product to tail off, and I feel like these past two years haven’t been to my standard.”Kelce posted seven consecutive 1,000-yard seasons from 2016 through 2022 before falling short of that mark in each of the past two. The four-time first-team All-Pro and 10-time Pro Bowl selection made 97 receptions for 823 yards last season – his lowest yardage total since 2014 – and had just three touchdown catches, down from a career-high 12 in 2022.The Chiefs’loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowllast February still lingers for him. “I just have such a motivation to show up this year for my guys,” Kelce said.As for what comes next when hisNFLcareer ends, Kelce isn’t entirely sure. “I don’t necessarily know if I’ll take it and run with it when I’m done playing,” he told GQ. “But I know that I want to stay around the football world as a profession and then dabble in other areas as well.”Kelce also addressed the constant attention surrounding his relationship with Swift, who was a regular at Chiefs games last season. “Whenever I’m with her, we’re just regular people,” he said. “When there is not a camera on us, we’re just two people that are in love. It can be perceived as something else because of how much it is talked about and how much we are tracked whenever we do go out, but I would say that it’s as normal of … it happened very organically even though from a media standpoint it was being tracked.”He added: “Nothing I’ve ever done has been a controlled, organized process. When I say it was so organic, we fell in love just based off the people we were sitting in a room together with. We are two fun-loving people who have the morals to appreciate everyone for who they are. We share all those values. It kind of just took the fuck off.”Kelce will have the chance to prove his renewed focus when the Chiefs open their season at home against the Los Angeles Chargers on 5 September.Explore more on these topicsTravis KelceKansas City ChiefsNFLTaylor SwiftUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Whether it’s Franco using his influence to elevate Real Madrid, in general, but with particular regard to theDi Stéfano affair; the way the government facilitated the sale of Madrid’s training ground for a gazillion euros; Barcelona conjuring thenpulling their beloved levers; the way it treats the women’s game, in general but with particular regard tothe Luis Rubiales affair; racismmore suited to a dissertation or police reportthan a tea-timely email; to say nothing of theFuentes blood bags.But even La Liga has always stayed true to one essential necessity: every team plays every other team twice, once at home and once away … until now, with this season’s Villarreal v Barcelona match, the Yellow Submissives v Mes Que Un Cash Cow, scheduled for Miami. The various suits tried this one a few years ago only for US Soccer to block the move citing a Fifa statute forbidding games from being scheduled outside their home territory. But since then, Relevent Sports – a company that clearly loves the game and, by amazing but unrelated coincidence, recently signed a six-year deal to be Uefa’s global marketing and sales partner for men’s club competitions – and whose owner, by amazing but unrelated coincidence, also owns the Dolphins’ Hard Rock Stadium – sued both official bodies to make more money for themselves. If you’re still reading, the case eventually settled with the understanding that Fifa would revisit the legislation and, shonuff y’all, as of yesterday they’ve been invited to do so.This is because Spanish football has had, for many years,el humpowith the Premier League, deeming its financial dominance unfair. This is, of course, hilarious – Real Madrid and Barcelona, its two richest institutions, have won 18 of the last 20 titles with its third-richest, Atlético, claiming the other two; Madrid have won five of the last 10 Bigger Cups; and Spanish clubs have paid eight of the 20 largest transfer fees of all time – but it is also a fact, mid-to-lower ranking Premier League clubs are able to outbid far more successful ones from across Europe. The problem, then, is not one of diagnosis but of treatment. To improve competitiveness and overall product, Spanish football might try to share TV revenue more evenly between clubs, helping make the chase for the title actually interesting; authorities could announce kick-off times more than 10 minutes before games, allowing more people to attend;take serious action against racismand sexism; stop clubs, the richest ones included, from living beyond their means; shrink the country so that away fans can travel and create atmosphere.Instead, though, Villarreal and Barcelona are being sent to the USA USA USA where, presumably, fans will show just how much they love and care for the game by putting its needs above their own and boycotting such an egregious and competitive disgrace. Football is capable of many wondrous things, but what it cannot do is change the history and geography of the planet and, though it is possible for people from elsewhere to understand the vibe, history and tradition of eastern Spain’s Castellón region – all power to them – clubs have names, names which represent a place. To take an example entirely at random, Villarreal are called Villarreal because they come from Villarreal, play in Villarreal and represent Villarreal; to significant extent, theyareVillarreal. That’s how it effin’ well works. So, though it’s brilliant to see this thing of ours traverse the world, mankind’s only creation able to cross every border, without that locus, no quantity of pounds, euros or dollars can make it worth anything, or mean anything. It is not just about what is integrity, but what is integral.QUOTE OF THE DAYTo Manchester United I decided and said yes.

She put together a brilliant performance against Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of the Cincinnati Open on Monday,narrowly losing 7-6 (3), 4-6, 7-6 (5)after three hours and nine minutes.Her impressive level was a reflection of the significant progress she has made in a positive summer on the North American hard courts.Monica Seles adapting to ‘new normal’ after being diagnosed with neuromuscular diseaseRead more“This is my first year on tour playing most of the calendar,” she said. “I had a tough start to the year and it was very difficult to change that. But in the last few months I’ve been building and the level has been increasing. The players I’m playing and losing to, they’re all top players so that gives me confidence.”That confidence marks a significant contrast to Raducanu’s inconsistent presence on tour last year because of injuries and training blocks scheduled during the season. The 22-year-old did not compete for four weeks last year in the lead-up to the US Open, where shelost in the first round against Sofia Kenin.“I went home and came back and it was a really difficult time in New York,” she said. “Since I won the tournament, it’s not been easy for me there. But this year I feel different, I’m a lot calmer behind the court.“On the court, I take more confidence in the big moments. I’ve been playing those big points pretty well for the most part so I’m looking forward to having some time to practise, improve and then get ready to play there.”Since becoming the first player to win a grand slam title from the qualifying tournament at the US Open, Raducanu has not won a match in New York. Zheng Qinwen and Paula Badosa have withdrawn from the tournament with injury, meaning Raducanu’s live ranking of No 34 would be enough for a seeding. But numerous players could still overtake her at the Cincinnati Open. Either way, her positive progress and form mean that few players would be keen to face her early in New York.Sabalenka has stressed that she believes Raducanu is on the right path towards returning to the top 10: “Every tournament, I feel like she’s improving and getting better, and she definitely gonna get back into the top 10,” she said. “She’s moving well, she’s a smart player. She’s serving well, even though sometimes you can see where she’s going. But the speed, the spin is very difficult to adjust to. She’s basically doing everything [well].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have alsostepped in to prevent a fare hike for passengers by extending the £3 fare cap until March 2027.”Explore more on these topicsTransport policyBus faresEnglandTransportLocal governmentHouse of CommonsYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

Its association in patients’ minds with cleanliness and professionalism meant that “white medical coats became the standard attire for physicians worldwide in the 20th century”.Until then, doctors had generally worn black clothing to reflect the seriousness of meetings with patients.People receiving healthcare find the white coat reassuring, the study found.“Regardless of gender, patients exhibited favourable attitudes towards physicians wearing white coats, perceiving the physicians as trustworthy, respectful, skilled, communicative and empathetic.”The white coat is still widely used by doctors worldwide. However, it wasbanned in the UK in 2008, when the government decided that medics working in the NHS should follow a “bare below the elbows” approach to reduce their risk of spreading infections. The British Medical Association was unsure that evidence justified the change.Despite patients’ preference for doctors wearing formal clothing, the Covid-19 pandemic made them more accepting of scrubs.“Patients tended to feel more comfortable with physicians wearing scrubs after Covid-19 ceased. While the traditional white coat is seen as a symbol of professionalism and trust, patients have increasingly accepted scrubs, especially in emergency or high-risk settings,” the researchers found.Globally, male doctors seem to enjoy another advantage in many patients’ minds as to what they wear.“Patients’ perceptions of male physicians’ accessories have shown that details such as watches and glasses significantly impact professionalism and trustworthiness” and add to their perceived authority, the study found.Explore more on these topicsDoctorsGenderWomenNHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The posts elicited snide responses fromSam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, and began a spat between the two former business partners on X.“Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besidesOpenAIto reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action,” Musk said in a post on X.In a post earlier that day, he wrote: “Hey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section whenXis the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps? Are you playing politics?”OpenAI’s ChatGPT currently holds the top spot in the App Store’s “Top Free Apps” section in the US, while xAI’s Grok ranks fifth. Apple has a partnership with OpenAI that integratesChatGPTinto iPhones, iPads and Macs. Apple and xAI did not provide comment.Altman responded to Musk on X: “This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like.” Musk has bent X’salgorithmic recommendationsto favor his own tweets, according to multiple reports.Altman and Musk founded OpenAI together in 2015, but Musk left the startup and rescinded funding in 2018 after proposing to take it over, a petition other executives rebuffed. Musk has since sued the company twice over its planned transition to a for-profit enterprise, alleging “deceit of Shakespearean proportions”. Altman has cast Musk as a bitter and petty ex-partner who was jealous of the company’s success after departing.Musk replied to Altman’s tweet: “You got 3M views on your bullshit post, you liar, far more than I’ve received on many of mine, despite me having 50 times your follower count!”Altman replied to Musk multiple times, first calling his lack of views a “skill issue”, then “or bots”, and then offered a legal question of his own: “Will you sign an affidavit that you have never directed changes to theXalgorithm in a way that has hurt your competitors or helped your own companies? i will apologize if so.”Users on X – through the community notes feature – have pointed out that a few apps besides OpenAI have taken the top spot on the App Store this year.Chinese AI app DeepSeek reached the No 1 spot on the platform in January, while in July, Perplexity took first place in India’s App Store – both occurring after the OpenAI andApplepartnership struck last year.One user asked X’s native AI, Grok, who was right in the feud.

It had relatively large eyes – approaching the size of tennis balls – and a short snout with deeply rooted teeth for gripping and tearing.“This was a really gnarly whale that I personally wouldn’t want to get in the water with,” Fitzgerald said.This Jurassic-era relic has survived 150 million years on Earth – now it’s one big fire from extinctionRead more“It’s essentially a little whale with big eyes and a mouth full of sharp, slicing teeth,” said co-author Ruairidh Duncan, a researcher at the Museums Victoria Research Institute and Monash University. “Imagine the shark-like version of a baleen whale – small and deceptively cute, but definitely not harmless.”Duncan and Fitzgerald described the new species in theZoological Journal of the Linnean Societyfrom an “exceedingly rare” fossil find that included a partial skull, ear bone and eight teeth – key features that enabled the scientists to identify it as a new species.When fully grown, the species was probably about 3m long. But the fossil was most likely a juvenile, based on its wide open root canals, barely worn teeth and bone connections that were not as tightly fused as in a mature specimen. “This individual was probably no more than about two to 2.2m long,” Fitzgerald said. “You could fit it on to a beach towel.”Janjucetus dullardilived during the Oligocene (30-23 million years ago) – about halfway back to the extinction of the dinosaurs – a time of global warmth and rising seas. It was the fourth known species from a group known as mammalodontids, unusual animals that were an “early offshoot” of the baleen whale family tree, Fitzgerald said.View image in fullscreenDr Erich Fitzgerald with the teeth and partial fossil skull ofJanjucetus dullardi.Photograph: Tom Breakwell/Museums VictoriaHe said evidence from fossils of tiny plankton from the Jan Juc Formation – the same kind of rock–suggested sea temperatures in southern Australia would have been warmer then, more akin to subtropical waters off Coffs Harbour.“In these seas, there was this extraordinary abundance of life, including all these little whales, giant penguins, sharks – about a third, or even twice as long as today’s great white shark – and various other primitive dolphins and other species of whales. It was a very different world,” Fitzgerald said.It was a turning point in the history of life in the oceans, and the beginning of an explosion in the diversification of whales and dolphins.Flinders University palaeontologist Prof John Long, who was not involved in the paper, said the fossil was a remarkable find that could help uncover the evolutionary steps as early carnivorous whales transitioned to become filter feeders.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In recognition of his contribution, the new species was named in his honour.This highlighted the critical role thatmembers of the publiccontinued to play in Australian palaeontology, Fitzgerald said. “It’s a reminder that world-changing fossils can be found in your own back yard.”“Victoria has got a rich fossil heritage,” said Long. “I grew up in Melbourne and collected fossils as a kid since I was seven.

A long oil slick from the 184-metre vessel, which was carrying hazardous cargo, was partially tackled by aircraft-borne dispersants, while a salvage operation sealed tanks to prevent leaks.But almost three months later, a more insidious and persistent environmental catastrophe is continuing along the ecologically fragile coast of the Arabian Sea. Among the 643 containers onboard were 71,500 sacks oftiny plastic pellets known as nurdles.

They lie scattered by the sea-facing Catholic church at Vettukadu and in tide lines on the beach, where giant jute bags of them, gathered by volunteers, await collection.Lightweight, buoyant and almost impossible to recover, they will circulate in moving sand and ocean currents for years, experts say.“The nurdles haven’t just polluted the sea – they’ve disrupted our entire way of life,” says Ajith Shanghumukham, a fish worker in the town.A fishing ban, imposed after the spill by local authorities in four Kerala districts, has since been lifted but fears over contamination have hit fishing communities already struggling with declining fish populations and the changing climate’s intensifying storms.“Very few people now venture out to sea because the local markets simply aren’t buying fish,” says Shanghumukham.Those who do report nets full of nurdles and declining catches. “People continue to worry about contamination,” Shanghumukham says.While 100,000 fishing families received compensation of 1,000 rupees (£8.50) from the state, this represented less than a week’s income for most. “The crisis has plunged many families into poverty,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe wreck of the MSC Elsa 3, which sank about 14 nautical miles off Kerala with 77,000 sacks of nurdles onboard.Photograph: Indian Ministry of DefenceNurdles, a colloquial term for the plastic pellets, are the raw material used for nearly all plastic products. Lentil-sized, at between 1-5mm, and thus potentially classifying as microplastics, or fragments smaller than 5mm, they can be devastating to wildlife, especially fish, shrimps and seabirds that mistake them for food. They also act as “toxic sponges” attracting so-calledforever chemicals such as PCBs and PFAsin seawater on to their surfaces, and also carry harmful bacteria such as E coli.Ingested by marine life, these pellets introduce a cocktail of toxins directly into the food webJoseph Vijayan“When ingested by marine life, these pellets introduce a cocktail of toxins directly into the food web,” says Joseph Vijayan, an environmental researcher from Thiruvananthapuram. “Toxins can accumulate in individual animals and increase in concentration up the food chain, ultimately affecting humans who consume seafood.”Microplastics have been found in humanblood,brains,breast milk,placentas,semenandbone marrow. Their full impact on human health is unclear, but they have beenlinked to strokes and heart attacks.The spill’s location and timing could not have been worse, Vijayan says. Nearly half of India’s seafish are landed in the Malabar upwelling region, where the shipwreck happened.And Kerala’s turbulent monsoon season, from June to August, which has hampered clean-up operations, is a time of great marine productivity, when rising nutrient-rich waters bring blooms of plankton, the foundation of the marine food web.View image in fullscreenA dead sea turtle, one of at least 90 washed ashore after the X-Press Pearl spill in 2021.Photograph: C Karunarathne/EPAWorryingly, following the Keralan spill, there have been reports of nurdles once again washing up on beaches in Sri Lanka, a reminder of theworst recorded plastic pollution spill in historywhen the X-Press Pearl container ship, carrying chemicals, caught fire and released 1,680 tonnes of nurdles into the sea off Colombo in 2021.The Kerala disaster, the latest in a series of pellet spills, has again exposed huge gaps in accountability, transparency and regulation in the plastics supply chain, environmentalists say.Dharmesh Shah, a Kerala-based plastics campaigner at theCentre for International Environmental Law, says: “These spills expose the transboundary nature of pellet pollution, affecting countries regardless of their role in plastic production.‘Nurdles are everywhere’: how plastic pellets ravaged a Sri Lankan paradiseRead more“They reveal a chronic lack of enforceable global standards across the supply chain – from production to transport – coupled with inadequate transparency, reporting and accountability.”Sekhar L Kuriakose, of the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority, estimates the clean-up could take up to five years. The state has filed a$1.1bn (£820m) compensation claimagainst MSC. The container shipping companyMSC, which chartered the vessel, along with the owner, havefiled a counterclaim, disputing jurisdiction and seeking to limit their liability.But the consequences of nurdle spills are being felt globally. In March, nurdles washed up on Britain’s Norfolk coast after acontainer ship collided with a tankerin the North Sea. In January 2024,millions of pellets washed up on Spain’s Galician coast.Communities can wait years for compensation. It took until last month for Sri Lanka’s highest court to rule that the X-press Pearl’s Singapore-based ownersowed $1bn compensationfor the 2021 sinking’s “unprecedented devastation to the marine environment” and economic harm.View image in fullscreenSri Lankans salvage material washed ashore from the X-Press Pearl. One problem with nurdles, says experts, is that they are not seen as hazardous material so they are shipped like any other cargo.Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/APAt least 445,000 tonnes of nurdlesare estimated to enter the environment annually worldwide;about 59% are terrestrial spills, with the rest at sea.The number of big nurdle spills at sea is increasing, according to Fidra, a Scottishenvironmental charity.With plastic production expected to triple to more than 1bn tonnes a year by 2060, along with more frequent and intense storms, the threat is expected to grow, with some 2tn nurdles spilling into the environment a year. Yet no international agreements exist on how to package and transport nurdles safely, or even to classify them as hazardous.This week, delegates from more than 170 countries aremeeting at the UN’s plastic pollution talks in Geneva, in an effort to resolve deep divisions over whether plastic production will be included in a final treaty. Campaigners hope successful talks will allow a global approach to pellet loss, packaging, transportation and legal accountability.View image in fullscreenNurdles washed ashore on Spain’s coastline in Tarragona. Millions of pellets washed up after a spill off Galicia on Spain’s Atlantic coast in January last year.Photograph: Josep Lago/AFP/GettyAmy Youngman, a lawyer at the Environmental Investigation Agency, says: “Because of the biodiversity in the area, the Kerala spill is devastating. But coming four years after the X-Pearl Xpress, it was foreseeable.”One problem, she says, is that ships are not required to disclose they are carrying pellets. Another is the failure to recognise harm when spilled. “They are not seen as hazardous or dangerous material so they are shipped like any other produce,” she says.World will be ‘unable to cope’ with volume of plastic waste in 10 years, warns expertRead moreHuman error causes most spills, she says, adding that laws on handling and storing pellets could reduce spills by 95%.A research paper published in June co-authored by Therese Karlsson, a scientific adviser for the International Pollutants Elimination Network, showed thatplankton may well have been malformedafter exposure to leached chemicals from plastic and burnt plastic debris from the X-Pearl Express. Of 16,000 chemicals in plastic, 4,000 are known to be hazardous. “But for more than 10,000 of them we don’t know the health impacts,” she says.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsSeascape: the state of our oceansPollutionCoastlinesInternational lawUnited NationsIndiaSri LankafeaturesShareReuse this content"

These are places where people take part in activities including swimming, rowing and paddleboarding. The Environment Agency had previously identified 342.Of these 3,347 areas, 1,727 were used for swimming, 1,706 for paddle boarding, 220 for rowing, 1,065 for sailing and 87 for surfing. Hugely popular inland areas included waterbody catchments around the Thames, Great Ouse, Cam, Nene, Tyne and Trent rivers and the natural lakes of the Lake District national park.The number of annual licences to use unpowered watercraft such as rowing boats, canoes and paddleboards has more than doubled, from 45,000 in 2017 to 100,000 in 2023.Recreation zones by waterbody typeDani Jordan, the director of campaigns and communities at Surfers Against Sewage, said: “This research only confirms what we’ve been saying for years. England’s wild waters are alive with swimmers, surfers, sailors and paddlers all year round. But the rules meant to protect them are stuck in the past.”There are just 451 official bathing sites in England – those within 500m of each other were not counted twice, to avoid including the same watercourse twice in the data.Only bathing areas that are designated as such by the government are tested for pollution to ensure they are safe for swimming, and these are tested only in the months marked as the official bathing season. However, the rainier months often bring more sewage pollution into England’s waterways as sewers become overloaded. The report found that only 20% of the areas used for swimming are within 500m of a designated bathing water monitoring point.View image in fullscreenPaddleboarders on Grasmere in the Lake District. The number of annual licences to use unpowered watercraft has more than doubled since 2017.Photograph: Sam Mellish/In Pictures/Getty ImagesCampaigners have been pushing for more rivers and lakes to be designated as bathing waters in order to put pressure on water companies and the government to clean up England’s waterways.Recent research found thatEngland’s bathing watersare five times more likely to be polluted with bacteria than those in the EU.E coliand other bacteria from sewage pollutiondumped by water companieshas plagued many outdoor recreation events in recent years, including theBoat Race in London.Experts have called for the government to step up testing outside the official bathing season, test more areas and come up with a strategy for removing pollution.Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “With huge demand for clean, safe waters year-round, we need more bathing waters designated alongside clear, time-bound measures to improve water quality. Public health and nature recovery must go hand in hand, creating thriving rivers, lakes and coasts where wildlife flourishes and people can enjoy spending time in and around the water.”Jordan said: “Right now, water-quality testing and bathing water laws are not fit for purpose. Most of our blue spaces aren’t even monitored – and that’s unacceptable. With bathing water reforms due this year, the government must act on this evidence, committing to year-round testing and protection for all water users – not just the narrow band of ‘bathers’ recognised in the current regulations.”Dr Robert Bradburne, the chief scientist at the Environment Agency said: “For the first time, we have robust and insightful data on how people use our waterways on a national scale.“Communities are using our rivers, lakes and seas for many reasons and it is clear that the way people interact with their local water environments has changed over time. We want to support water users by helping them to make informed decisions when out on the water.“This data will help us to plan our resources effectively as we work with the government to implement their bathing water reforms.”Explore more on these topicsWaterPollutionEnglandRiversSwimmingRowingnewsShareReuse this content"

Industry estimates by Material Focus, a non-profit aiming to improve electrical recycling in the UK, found more than 100,000 tonnes of electricals such as irons and microwaves were binned across the UK each year.Levies placed on these online retailers would help improve the collection and treatment of waste items collected by local authorities or returned to retailers, and ensure there was increased investment in critical recycling infrastructure, the government said.Increase in vapes found on Britain’s coastline by beach clean volunteersRead moreCompanies such as Amazon will have to register with the Environment Agency and report data on sales made by their overseas sellers in the UK, and this will be used to work out how much should be charged to finance the recycling of these objects.The circular economy minister, Mary Creagh, said: “We are committed to moving towards a circular economy in which we keep electricals from laptops to toasters in use for longer.“Ensuring online marketplaces pay their share for managing the cost of the electrical waste they generate will increase recycling and level the playing field for UK-based retailers, boosting growth and making the system fairer through our plan for change.”Electronics companies welcomed the change. Paula Coughlan, the chief sustainability officer at Currys, said: “We welcome this positive change that helps create a more level playing field for UK retailers. It is important that the responsibility to safely dispose of electronic waste is shared fairly, and we’re pleased the government has listened to us and other industry leaders. As well as making online marketplaces pay for the waste they create, we should be going further to set stretch targets and incentivise investment in cleaning it up too.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This is the sixth consecutive month of below-average rainfall.Five areas of England are in drought: Yorkshire; Cumbria and Lancashire; Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire; East Midlands; and West Midlands.Dry conditions could last well into October, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology has warned, which would put higher pressure on water supplies as rivers, reservoirs and aquifers are at very low points after a very dry spring and summer.dry weather and drought graphic map of EnglandIts latest hydrological outlook says: “Normal to below normal groundwater levels are likely to persist through both August and the August-October period.” It added the situation would continue for “low river flows across central and southern England”.More parts of the country could be at risk of being plunged into drought conditions as aquifers are depleted. These are underground stores of water which take a long time, and a lot of sustained rainfall, to recharge.These were full after a very wet winter in 2024 and the start of 2025, but the dry conditions have caused them to become depleted.At the moment, it is mainly areas reliant on reservoirs and chalk streams that are facing drought and hosepipe bans, as areas such as London have been able to use the resources from the chalk aquifer.The hydrological forecast warns: “The outlook for August is for normal to below normal levels, with notably to exceptionally low levels for the southern chalk and carboniferous limestones in central southern England, south Wales and the South Downs. Over August-October, normal to below normal levels are the most likely outcome.”The National Drought Group – which includes the Met Office, the government, regulators, water companies, the National Farmers’ Union, the Canal & River Trust, anglers, and conservation experts – used the meeting to highlight the water-saving measures each sector is taking.Dr Will Lang, chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “This week is starting off warmer than of late across England and Wales, with temperatures getting towards the mid-30s celsius for some in the south.“As we move into the second half of August there are indications of high pressure building and therefore largely settled conditions overall. Although dry weather is more likely, rain, showers or thunderstorms cannot be ruled out.”The Environment Agency’s director of water and the National Drought Group chair, Helen Wakeham, said: “The current situation is nationally significant, and we are calling on everyone to play their part and help reduce the pressure on our water environment.“Water companies must continue to quickly fix leaks and lead the way in saving water.“We know the challenges farmers are facing and will continue to work with them, other land users and businesses to ensure everyone acts sustainably.”Explore more on these topicsDroughtWaterEnvironment AgencyWater industryEnglandUK weatherGreen politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Far-right agitators wrongly claimed that the killer was a Muslim asylum seeker.Deputy chief constable Sam de Reya, the NPCC lead for communications and media, said: “We saw during last summer’s disorder, as well as in several recent high-profile cases, what the major, real-world consequences can be from what information police release into the public domain.“We have to make sure our processes are fit for purpose in an age of social media speculation and where information can travel incredibly quickly across a wide range of channels.“Disinformation and incorrect narratives can take hold in a vacuum. It is good police work for us to fill this vacuum with the facts about issues of wider public interest.”Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor for North West England, cautiously welcomed the decision.“Trust is so low that more transparency is a good thing, as recent experience has shown. It has to be on a case by case basis though,” he said.The Warwickshire police and crime commissioner, Philip Seccombe, called for fresh national guidance afterpolice were accused by Reform UKof failing to confirm that two Afghan men being prosecuted for an alleged attack on a 12-year-old girl were asylum seekers.The alleged rape, said to have happened on 22 July, was at the centre of a political storm after the Reform leader, Nigel Farage, amplified claims of a police cover-up.Ahmad Mulakhil has been charged with rape and Mohammad Kabir has been charged with kidnap and strangulation.Explore more on these topicsPoliceCrimeUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

It will be Nigel Farage and Reform,” he said, in an interview with the Guardian. “Trying to make those issues more salient is a strategic blunder. First and foremost the Conservatives need to fight the next election on the economy.”Gauke criticised his party for spending too much time on culture-war issues where Farage was the dominant voice.The former MP, who has authored a major sentencing review forLabourset to be made law this autumn, said it was not a foregone conclusion that Farage would become prime minister, but depended on Labour kickstarting economic growth.He said to do so would mean hard choices for Rachel Reeves on tax rises and the pensions triple lock, as well as seeking a much closer relationship with the EU, saying the Labour chancellor “needs to talk to the bond markets more than she needs to talk to the parliamentary party or the British public”.He said the Tory party had not yet fully confronted why it had become so unpopular and had not undergone the transformation that Labour had after defeat at the 2019 election.View image in fullscreenDavid Gauke said he wanted the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to succeed in driving economic growth.Photograph: Anna Gordon/The Guardian“Most of the Labour party [MPs] felt that the Jeremy Corbyn years were an aberration and that they wanted to revert to something different. They found it very easy to repudiate, whereas quite a lot of the Conservative party looks back at the Boris Johnson and Liz Truss time as being proper Conservatism,” he said.“I don’t think the Conservative party is close to recognising how badly placed they are, and all the thinking at the moment is the worry about Reform. Yes, Reform are taking Conservative votes, but a lot of that was because the Conservatives just no longer looked functional.”He said the party had no message that would resonate with the home counties. “The aspirational, successful, educated voter, they voted Conservative for economic competence, but now looks at the Conservative party and thinks, ‘you haven’t really been speaking to me for a very long time, probably not since the 2015 election’,” he said.Gauke, who had the Conservative whip removed by Johnson in 2019 for voting to stop a no-dealBrexit, said he believed the Labour government had to be more resilient to criticism and unpopularity – and that the Reform UK surge in the polls was not necessarily a sign Farage was on course to be PM.“There will be a lot of tactical voting against Reform. [Farage] is evidently beatable if Labour can deliver strong economic growth. I think it would be hard for the Conservatives to win the next election, but they can re-establish themselves as the main opposition,” he said. “But if both try to say ‘Nigel Farage is right, but please don’t vote for him’, then I think they’re in real trouble.”Instead of being surprised at the polls, Labour MPs should accept “that being in government you are going to be unpopular”, he said. “Governments used to come back from deep levels of unpopularity on a regular basis and it can still be done. All of that has become much harder but it’s still fundamentally true. But you have to have a programme and there’s not been enough of it.”Gauke said he wanted Reeves to succeed in driving economic growth but that would mean tough political choices because of the high debt interest Britain was paying. “We are on the naughty step. If we had the same gilt yields as Germany, we would be paying £50bn less in debt interest a year,” he said.The former chief secretary to the Treasury said it was “a delusion that’s very popular on the left of politics” that enough could be raised by just putting up taxes on the very wealthy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

None of these things are electorally popular, but if the markets think, ‘actually this is a serious government’, then you get into a virtuous circle,” he said.Keir Starmer and Reeves should also be prepared to ask for more from the EU in terms of trade ties, Gauke said. “They made some really good progress earlier this year, there was hardly any political reaction. Be bolder. Come back to that. Businesses would love it if we were prepared to be bolder on the EU.”View image in fullscreenGauke said he was deeply concerned his party would embrace the policy of leaving the ECHR.Photograph: Anna Gordon/The GuardianGauke, who has spent time with the justice secretary,Shabana Mahmood, said she had been lord chancellor with a “sense of direction” who was effectively driving change at the department.Mahmood is known to be seriously considering what the UK could do to reform its approach to the European convention on human rights, including whether the government could act unilaterally on how it interpreted some aspects of the convention when it came to prisons or immigration.But Gauke said he was concerned about the UK acting alone, and said it would be more effective for signatory countries to press for change as a collective.“My sense from where Shabana is – is can it be improved? Is the interpretation of it much broader than we would want? And I think those are the right questions to be asking,” he said. “If you try and set the dynamic up as ‘us against the rest’, then you’re just heading for a fall, but a lot of the concerns that the UK has about the operation of the ECHR is reflected in other signatories. You’re going to have to work with other countries.”He said he was deeply concerned his own party would embrace the policy of leaving the ECHR, a move favoured by the Tory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick.“You just end up with a repeat of the Brexit episodes, of our international influence being diminished and our reputation damaged and a big practical issue in Northern Ireland. I don’t know why the country would be attracted to that as an offer,” he said.Explore more on these topicsConservativesDavid GaukeLabourReform UKEconomic policyHuman rightsBrexitnewsShareReuse this content"

She remained emotionless when escorted back to her cell.View image in fullscreenBetro, 45, was arrested last summer and extradited to the UK.Photograph: West Midlands police/PAThe court heard how she had tried to shoot Sikander Ali outside his home in Yardley, Birmingham, on the evening of 7 September 2019, but her handgun jammed.Betro told the court that she had met Nazir on a dating app and had travelled to the UK twice before the attempted killing to spend time with him, including between December 2018 and January 2019. She told jurors that the third trip was to celebrate her birthday and attend a boat party.CCTV footage presented to the court showed Betro standing outside Ali’s suburban home shortly before 8pm on 7 September. As Ali exited his car, Betro was shown to pull out a handgun but failed to fire any rounds, with Ali jumping back into his car and driving away.Jurors heard that Betro and her co-conspirators targeted the victim after Aslam and Nazir were injured during a physical altercation in a shop owned by Ali’s father, Aslat Mahumad, which led the pair to resolve to have him or a member of his family killed as retribution.After the failed murder attempt, the court heard that Betro texted Ali’s father messages such as “Where are you hiding?” and “Stop playing hide and seek, you are lucky it jammed.”The court was told that hours later, Betro returned to Ali’s home in a taxi and fired three rounds into his now empty house, before leaving again.The defence barrister, Paul Lewis KC, said he was not asking for pre-sentence reports as they would not assist the court.Drew told the court: “I suspect Miss Betro would like to know the outcome of this case and there is nothing worse than sitting waiting.”Betro, who fled to the US while Aslam and Nazir were tried in the same court, spent several years in Armenia after the attempted murder, before being arrested last summer and extradited to the UK in January this year.John Sheehan, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service’s extradition unit that returned Betro to the UK, called the operation a “complex investigation and extradition process”.He said he hoped the conviction would send a clear message that the CPS would “pursue criminals who attempt to evade justice, and make sure that they are brought to a courtroom to be held accountable for their actions”.Betro is due to be sentenced on Thursday 21 August.Explore more on these topicsUK newsBirminghamnewsShareReuse this content"

He had pleaded not guilty in January to a nine-count indictment charging him with securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud and money-laundering conspiracy.Accused of misleading investors in 2021 about TerraUSD – a so-called stablecoin designed to maintain a value of $1 – Kwon pleaded guilty to the two counts under an agreement with the Manhattan US attorney’s office, which brought the charges.He faces up to 25 years in prison when Engelmayer sentences him on 11 December, though prosecutor Kimberly Ravener said the government had agreed to advocate for a prison term of no more than 12 years, provided he accepts responsibility for his crimes. He has been detained since his extradition fromMontenegrolate last year.Kwon is one of several cryptocurrency moguls to face federal charges after a slump in digital token prices in 2022 prompted the collapse of a number of companies.Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the US’s largest crypto exchange,FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2024.‘He knew it was wrong’: Sam Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years in prison over FTX fraudRead moreProsecutors alleged that when TerraUSD slipped below its $1 peg in May 2021, Kwon told investors a computer algorithm known as “Terra Protocol” had restored the coin’s value. Instead, they said, he arranged for a high-frequency trading firm to secretly buy millions of dollars of the token to artificially prop up its price.Prosecutors said that false claim and others drove retail and institutional investors to buy Terraform products and boost the value of Luna – a more traditional token that fluctuated in value but was closely linked to TerraUSD – to $50bn by the spring of 2022.In court, Kwon apologized for his conduct.“I made false and misleading statements about why it regained its peg by failing to disclose a trading firm’s role in restoring that peg,” Kwon said. “What I did was wrong.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He deployed troops toLos Angelesagainst the state and city’s wishes to tamp down protests against immigration enforcement, and sent troops toWashington DCand took over the local police citing allegedly increased crime.The Department of Defense would not weigh in directly on the idea of a “reaction force”.“The Department of Defense is a planning organization and routinely reviews how the department would respond to a variety of contingencies across the globe,” a defense official said in a statement to the Guardian. “We will not discuss these plans through leaked documents, pre-decisional or otherwise.”In the documents, the Post reports, it calls for 600 troops to be placed at the ready at military bases in Alabama and Arizona, able to deploy quickly if called. This force could cost “hundreds of millions of dollars”. The documents have timestamps from late July and early August, though they are marked as “pre-decisional”.The plan, if implemented, would be an expansion of the use of troops in US cities and is legally questionable. National guard troops are frequently deployed in their states to respond to disasters and, particularly in 2020, to civil unrest, when many states called on their units to deploy amid protests over police brutality.Hina Shamsi, the director of the ACLU’s National Security Project, said in a statement that the move would be a “breathtakingly dangerous power grab”.“Sending armed troops into cities to suppress protest should be a non-starter in any healthy democracy, but especially in a country founded on a strong presumption against the military policing civilians,” Shamsi said. “The right to protest is core to the constitution and who we are as a nation, yet theTrump administrationseems ready to betray our basic values in order to muzzle political expression across the country.”In 2020, around the time of the election, the Associated Pressreportedthen, the guard designated military police units in Alabama and Arizona to rapidly respond “if requested by a governor in another state”. In that instance, reporting at the time said, governors would need to request the help – it would not be deployed just by the administration, as has happened in recent months.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

The tragedy drew international attention and highlighted pervasive abuse in the government’s shelter system.The six sentenced on Tuesday – two former police officers and four former child protection officials – were found guilty of homicide, mistreatment of minors, breach of duties and abuse of authority. All pleaded not guilty.Judge Ingrid Cifuentes also ordered the investigation of former president Jimmy Morales for his role in ordering police to work at a facility where minors who had not committed crimes were held.‘Screaming in terror’: teen survivor relives ordeal of Guatemala children’s shelter fireRead moreFormer social welfare secretary Carlos Rodas was sentenced to 25 years in prison.Earlier, Rodas told those gathered in the courtroom, including relatives of the victims, that he had not caused “any harm to their daughters and the survivors”.Also among those convicted was ex-police officer Lucinda Marroquín, who held the key to the room where the girls were locked up and didn’t open it when the fire started. She was sentenced to 13 years in prison.The judge said that through phone records, investigators were able to establish that at the time of the fire Marroquín was talking on her phone. The judge said a witness had testified that when told about the fire, Marroquín responded with profanity and said “let them burn.”A former government prosecutor assigned to the protection of children was acquitted.The fire occurred on 8 March 2017, at the Virgin de la Asunción Safe Home outside Guatemala City, when 56 girls and teenagers were padlocked in a classroom allegedly for bad behavior.About 700 children – nobody knew exactly how many – lived in a home with a maximum capacity for 500. The majority had committed no crime. They were sent there by the courts for various reasons: they had run away, they were abused, they were migrants.The night before the fire, a group of girls had escaped. Hours later, the police returned them to the home. They were locked in a room that had no access to a bathroom and guarded by police. They were given foam mattresses to sleep on.After hours of demanding to be let out, one girl lit the fire.After spending hours locked inside, one of the girls lit a match to a mattress, thinking it might force police to let them out. Smoke and flames quickly filled the room, but despite cries for help, police refused to open the doors for nine minutes, witnesses said.Forty-one girls and teenagers died, and 15 more survived with serious burns.Cifuentes said that the fire was the culmination of a series of abuses, some of which had been reported to authorities but not acted on. She said autopsies confirmed the presence of drugs in some of the girls that supported their complaints that they were given sleeping pills that were among the reasons they had tried to escape the facility.Explore more on these topicsGuatemalaYoung peopleAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

She had just performed aTed talkabout the future of comedy and was heading home to the US, when someone she thought worked for airport security quizzed her about her visit.Thinking he was probing for visa infringements, “I just said I was doing comedy. Then he asked: ‘What do you joke about?’ Stupidly, I lightly flirted with him, and was like: ‘Everything other than airport security!’ He didn’t react at all. Then I realised he was US border control. He asked again: ‘What do you joke about?’”Friedman is a veteran of The Daily Show and The Late Show, and her standup comedy often features excoriating routines at the expense of the political establishment. “I just froze because I am a political comedian and I didn’t know what to say. Then he said: ‘Do you joke about politicians?’”She made it home, but the incident stuck with her. Friedman lives in LA, and the recent actions of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement “detaining anyone and everyone who looks a certain way” put her on high alert. “It was such a quick, on its face benign, interaction,” she says. “But it did feel like a scene out of The Handmaid’s Tale. I’m a blonde, white woman who looks like a Republican’s wife and I have an American passport. But what if I had said ‘Yes?’ Don’t we want to live in a country where we can joke about politicians, where we can joke about anything?”View image in fullscreen‘Don’t we want to live in a country where we can joke about politicians?’ … Jena Friedman.Photograph: Peacock/Heidi Gutman/Getty ImagesFriedman incorporated that moment into her new standup show, Motherf*cker, which she’s performing at the Edinburgh fringe. The show is a change of pace. She’s generally resisted getting personal on stage, resenting the idea that women have to be relatable to succeed in comedy, but this time it felt unavoidable, as she explores the life-changing experience of becoming a parent while her own mother was dying. “It’s about grief, but it’s also political,” she says. “The vibe in certain circles does feel like we’re grieving. So there’s something about my show that’s connecting to the larger moment.”Friedman is among a crop of US comedians with roots in topical comedy appearing at this year’s fringe. Another stalwart of US political comedy, Michelle Wolf, is back, too, while standup and former Saturday Night Live writer Sam Jay is making her festival debut.Wolf earned her stripes on The Daily Show and Late Night with Seth Myers, and gained notoriety with her 2018 set at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, in whichshe roasted Trump and his collaborators. These days, she lives in Barcelona, although returns to the US regularly for comedy work. She’s yet to encounter border trouble but, with reports of people with green cards and citizens being detained, she says: “I’m keeping an eye on it.”Comedians Rosie O’Donnell and Ellen DeGeneres have both said that the state ofUS politicshas forced them out of the country – O’Donnell to Ireland and DeGeneres to England. O’Donnell has written a show on just that, which she performed for the first week of the fringe. Wolf is happy with her move to Barcelona, and feels her comedy has benefited from other cultural perspectives, but returns to the US because “the audiences are great” and there’s plenty of work. While other US comedians have also discussed the idea of moving to Europe, she thinks it won’t happen until there’s “an impetus to go, something I don’t think is far off, like: you can’t talk about this any more, you can’t talk about that any more”.Last month, satirist Stephen Colbert announced that networkCBS had cancelled The Late Showafter 33 years. Many thought the timing, three days on from Colbert criticising CBS parent company Paramount for settling a lawsuit with Donald Trump, was suspect. Fellow late-night talkshow host Jon Stewartcriticised the moveon his podcast and pointed to wider fear across the industry.: “There are a lot of things that will never be made, that you will never know about, that will be killed in the bed before they ever had a chance because of this chilling effect.”Friedman’s glad to see Colbert and Stewart speaking out against Trump and his administration – and agrees there’s a “chill”. “The industry has already been less supportive of political comedy than they were under Biden and Obama. However, “seeing the most prominent comedians taking [Trump] to task, likeMatt [Stone] and Trey [Parker] from South Park, Colbert and Stewart, that gives me hope”.View image in fullscreenMichelle Wolf’s standup explores society through the ‘lens of being a mom’.Photograph: Stephen Keable/AlamyMeanwhile, Michelle Wolf’s standup merges the personal and political and her podcast, Wolf’s Thought Box, tackles current affairs. Her new show, which she’s performing while eight months pregnant at the fringe, explores life and society “through the lens of being a mom now”. There are punchlines on societal pressures for working mothers, home birth, momfluencers, gender inequalities and more. “We’re in an era now where people are talking about motherhood realistically and that’s very refreshing,” she says.Still, political comedy isn’t absent. “I feel like I have to address the whole America and Trump thing … people expect me to say something about it.” She plans to tailor topical jokes to the day’s news but, “I don’t like making it a large part of my set, because it bores me. There’s always something crazy happening, but it’s hard to come up with creative angles other than: can you believe this?”It’s been nine years since she first started writing jokes about Trump and, in that time, her life has transformed – she met her partner, moved abroad, and is about to have her second child. Her main feeling now is: “How are we still talking about him? How are we still in the same spot?”Jay reflects that slow build in her show, We the People, in which she explores the state of America – looking back to the “unconfident whites” who founded the nation. She describes the show as “a fun, risky little ride” as she tries to get to the root of why the US feels so divided, and what we can do to better understand one another. “It’s this broader conversation I’ve been having about America and race,” Jay says.The whole world feels unsettled right now and there’s an inability to consider other perspectives, Jay says. “How did we get here as Americans? Of course, I think race plays a large part in it. And how did these race relations get to the way they are? Not just blaming white people, but exploring the type of white people we’re dealing with, why they might be the way they are, their roots in England.”Trump came up plenty during Jay’s time on SNL and appears in her fringe show as a “braggadocious” fool, unable to keep state secrets, yet smartly appealing to the frustrations of America’s poor white communities. But the conditions that created and elevated Trump are more interesting to Jay: “He’s the symptom of this, not the cause. This is a result of years and years of us doing it wrong … it’s been building for a long time and for a lot of different reasons.”‘TikTok is like an old-school variety show’: what’s behind the surprising boom in ventriloquism?Read moreFriedman agrees: “I started working at the Daily Show in 2012, I was at Letterman before that, so I started looking at politics on a daily basis since 2010, and this is a long time coming.” This also means that, among US audiences, not everyone wants political comedy. “They’re always looking for escapism. In the first term, there was definite Trump fatigue,” Friedman says. “As a political comic, I’ve always done better in the UK than the US. It’s the UK audiences who are like: what the hell’s going on over there?” says Friedman.The mood in US comedy is, Jay says, “the mood in America … chaos. There’s no way to keep up. People are also very desensitised. Shit just keeps happening in more extreme ways that people are losing a metric for it.”All three agree that comedy can help share differing worldviews. “Even if it’s people we disagree with, the sign of a healthy democracy is when people can safely be on stage saying whatever we want, ideally in good faith,” Friedman says. “I support all comedians, I support freedom of expression and I want to see more of it. I want to see people more open to people they disagree with. Whenever I do political comedy, the goal is not to preach to the choir, it’s to get people to see things slightly differently.”Jay has said that comedy can be a tool for empathy. “I look at it as a conversation. Itcanserve a purpose of actual understanding, understanding that we’re all humans trying to figure out a thing that doesn’t make a lot of sense – existing. Everybody is grappling with these things in their own way.”What does the future hold for US comedians? “It’s too soon to tell,” says Friedman. “But I think everybody exercising the US first amendment in a way that’s funny and disarming is really important right now.”Jay says: “Once I’m on stage, I’m gonna say what I’m gonna say. If I can’t come back as a result, I’ll just have to have my girlfriend come meet me in Scotland.”Jena Friedman: Motherf*ckeris atHive 1atMonkey Barrel Comedy until 24 August.Michelle Wolfis at various venues until 17 August.Sam Jay: We the Peopleis atPleasance Courtyard until 24 AugustExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Iestyn Davies, whose Orpheus will be amid the tumblers, dancers and acrobats, writes of pushing boundaries – and heart-stopping wonderIestyn DaviesTue 12 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 12.59 EDTShareOperas tell stories; like all great art, the operas that endure don’t just tell stories – they reshape the way stories can be told. And it takes more than memorable tunes and a finely honed libretto to bring a piece into the hallowed pantheon of the operatic canon. Often it is the challenging of expectations that moves the dial for ever, permitting the art form to evolve, inspire and establish new ways of telling old stories.In my career as a countertenor opera singer I am often to be found singing the works of Handel, a composer whose oeuvre helped to define opera in the first half of the 18th century. Today, we often perform his operas in a style that befits our time; directors such as Katie Mitchell, Barrie Kosky, Richard Jones or Claus Guth push the singing actor far beyond what the famed castrati or prima donnas of Handel’s day were expected to do. And, as I prepare to take on singing Gluck’s opera Orpheus and Eurydice at the Edinburgh international festival I am acutely aware that its success will lie in both the staging and the piece itself. A quarter of a millennium ago Gluck’s work broke new ground by challenging audiences’ expectations. This staging withCircawill do the same.Gluck and his librettist Calzabigi “reformed” opera. They wanted to move towards a noble simplicity and away from arcane plots.They chose for their mission the story of Orpheus and his descent into the underworld to rescue his wife, Eurydice. At its heart then was a character famed for his musical skill, moreover one who played an intrinsic role in the interpretation of classical mythology in western culture. The final piece in their jigsaw was to engage the famous Italian castrato Gaetano Guadagni, who as a young singer had enjoyed great success working in London with Handel. Together with Gluck, Guadagni found a musical language that did away with complex virtuosity – instead of arias that paused to reflect and repeat, as the audiences at the time were used to, it focused on driving the drama forwards.In fact, Guadagni had made many enemies in the London audiences who were said to have hissed his appearance on the stage after his refusal to bow to acknowledge applause (in order to maintain dramatic unity). He also shunned the overindulgence, prevalent at the time, to repeat well-received arias. Most notably, it was his association with the English actor David Garrick that bore fruit in his subsequent collaboration with Gluck.View image in fullscreen‘I will be literally standing on the shoulders of these giants’ … Iestyn Davies on working with Circa.Photograph: Pablo StrongGarrick himself had changed the English stage. Gone were the soliloquies delivered standing stock-still. He dared to move around the stage while talking, gesticulate and, even (rare at the time), listen to the other characters and react to what they said! He was admired for his range of facial expressions and the air of truthfulness he brought to his parts. He worked with Guadagni in London and it is clear that the singer adopted the actor’s innovative stage behaviour.Guadagni’s commitment to playing Orpheus over the span of his later life suggests an empathy with the character brought about by an involvement with the role akin to what we might call method acting. In a break from operatic tradition, themajority of Gluck’s new opera was declamatory in nature, hardly ever pausing to signal a shift from the recitative (the more narrative parts, often sung in the rhythm of speech) to the songs or arias.On stage in Gluck’s new work, Guadagni was noted for his continuous acting throughout; he was praised for the resultant vigour and verisimilitude this brought. This shift would have shocked audiences of the time. In a daring challenge to his colleagues, the castrato no longer put himself first, but rather the character and the story. As a result he was one of the first singers ever to build a career through identification with a single role.It’s a role that I have sung before in concert and on record but not as yet on stage. I associate closely with Guadagni, having performed a number of his parts written for him by Handel, and also in sharing the dubious honour of us both having had racehorses named after us. (Mr Davies’s career was not long, nor distinguished).My countertenor range probably shares many of the qualities of a falsetto singer such as Guadagni. Countertenor voices are often described as “otherworldly” and “ethereal” in sound, and there’s a beautiful, expressive legato to be found throughout Guadagni’s roles that appeals to me. Furthermore, in the past two decades of my career I have relished more than anything else opportunities that give me a chance to be a “singing actor” in the truest sense of the phrase. I learned a great deal from being on stage opposite Mark Rylance in the play Farinelli and the King: the magic he was able to conjure through his tinkering with rhythm and phrasing; dynamic range seemed to be a key attribute to his delivery; and, above all, his constant connection with the audience via an invisible thread that tugged gently at their attention throughout was masterly. I can see a connection to how to play Orpheus, who as a lone character on the stage is so inside of himself, and the subtle way in which actors such as Rylance communicate their thoughts with such transparency.View image in fullscreenHeart-stopping wonder … Opera Queensland’s production of Orpheus and Eurydice in association with Circa.Photograph: Keith SaundersHelping me on this journey is the breathtaking performing arts company Circa together with its artistic director Yaron Lifschitz. At the time of writing I have yet to meet them and my experience of this production has been limited to watching a dress-rehearsal video (the staging premiered in Australia in 2019). But it is not often that I find myself gasping out loud at so many moments of heart-stopping wonder as the acrobats climb, tumble, fall, stretch, dance and cover the stage in a kind of physical expression of the inner machinations of Orpheus’s mind. At certain points, I will be literally standing on the shoulders of these giants and pushing my own boundaries of my stage experience to date.The story transforms from a psychological drama into a living and breathing organism around the two central singersGluck’s opera combined the beauty of singing with the poise and refinement of ballet and there’s no lack of gracefulness in Circa’s often audacious schemes. Indeed, at all times it looks and feels human; I can imagine the excitement Gluck’s Viennese audience would have felt in seeing this new and energetic style when I watch Circa. The story transforms from a psychological drama into a living and breathing organism around the two central singers. The Australian soprano Samantha Clarke, in a twist on tradition, performs both the roles of Eurydice and Amore (Cupid) in director Yaron Liftschitz’s interpretation.When a great opera tells a story well, as Gluck’s Orpheus and Eurydice does, it becomes a piece we can bring back time and time again. And in the hands of an imaginative director, surprises emerge that cast new light on the music in ways you never imagined. I have been lucky enough to be a part of Barrie Kosky’s hit production of Handel’s Saul at Glyndebourne this summer, and what I have learned from it is that when you challenge expectations, and do so with vivid imagination and a sprinkling of audacity fuelled with integrity and commitment, you are more than likely to make people sit up and engage.In Orpheus and Eurydice, Gluck, Calzabigi and Guadagni knew this too.Orpheus and Eurydice (with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and chorus of Scottish Opera) isat Edinburgh Playhousefrom 13-16 August, part of the Edinburgh international festivalExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fixed, the filthy animated comedy unleashed onNetflixwith a content warning that should apply to this review as much as the movie, both indulges in and tests our limits when it comes to that humour, largely by getting down (on all fours) and dirty with its hand-drawn canines.Weapons review – Zach Cregger’s slick Barbarian follow-up is a bumpy rideRead moreHere’s a movie with talking pets that rarely rises above a bull terrier’s vantage point. Humans remain mostly out of frame. We see their legs – a regular scene of the crime – but never their faces. In the opening minutes, we’re right there with Bull (voiced by Pitch Perfect’s Adam DeVine), the movie’s pudgy un-neutered protagonist, as he works hard to bust a nut on his household’s nana.The elderly woman is asleep on a sofa seat, her wrinkles sit still while he makes a mess of her stockings. The screen, and whatever objects are in its frame (like dog tags and dentures), rock to his rhythmic thrusting. His moans and Pornhub-rated gift for gab get louder with every back and forth, along with the squishing sound whenever he makes contact. It’s a raucous bit, made all the more hilarious and uncomfortable because of how long it lasts. And it raises the question: would this behaviour be as cute and tolerable in real life if we considered how much fun dogs were having, and if we gave them human character traits and facial expressions, which in those moments can come off as downright depraved?Fixed gets as much mileage as it can out of gags that largely centre on Bull’s gonads, with its entire narrative built around a wild night out when he discovers his owner’s plan to finally give him the snip. But that humour, and its shock value, wears thin in less time than it takes for Bull to satisfy his urges.The movie can be a little too self-satisfied with its premise, mixing R-rated humour with the kind of quaint animation style – bright colours and defined black outlines – we remember from more innocent times. Tellingly, co-writer and director Genndy Tartakovsky (of Samurai Jack and Hotel Transylvania fame) first pitched the idea in 2009, when something like this might have felt risque and rare.That was the same year The Hangover became an R-rated blockbuster comedy hinging on a similarly debauched premise, and more than a decade into South Park’s success as late-night cartoon fare explicitly made for adults. It’s also long before 2016’s The Secret Life of Pets and Sausage Party, the former being far more imaginative and adventurous when mapping out social hierarchies in the domesticated animal space, and the latter – with its foul-mouthed grocery items – taking raunchy feature animation to its furthest limits.The button pushing in South Park and Sausage Party also casts a wider net, regularly spilling over into socio- and geopolitics. I mean, South Park is rankling the Trump administration with far more pointed dick jokes. And who could forget the feuding bagel and lavash in Sausage Party, where the Israel-Palestine conflict was played out along shelf-space.Fixed, on the other hand, rarely breaks orbit from the fixations of pets and strays, or at least what we imagine those to be. Beyond the horny animal stuff: there’s marking their territory, sniffing each other’s behinds, chasing squirrels (the violence of which is yet another thing where the humour of it is met with the unsettling shock of what happens when the predators catch their prey) and philosophizing over the unending appeal of bouncy (tennis) balls.The limited scope often leaves Fixed feeling stretched and redundant, especially when we get to the umpteenth gag about Bull’s testicles, which he imagines having Napoleonic personalities of their own. But at the same time, the movie’s narrow obsession with Bull’s balls is meaningfully consistent with the story it is telling.Bull bases his entire personality on having testes, after all, so much so that he lords it over his dog park pals – Rocco (Idris Elba, doing wonderful work as a statuesque boxer licking his emotional wounds over being abandoned by his mother), Lucky (Bobby Moynihan as a beagle who can’t stop devouring cat litter) and Fetch (Fred Armisen as a dachshund dressed for Instagram likes). The loyal squadron tolerate Bull’s misguided arrogance and join along as he attempts to break free. They stumble through city back alleys and into a sordid sex club, which amuses with canine answers to pole dancing and orgies, while Bull tries to finally do the deed with something other than nana’s legs.As much as he derives his mojo from having balls, Bull is still so crippled with an inferiority complex that he can’t go all the way with fellow canines. That’s especially true when it comes to the show dog nextdoor, Honey, an Afghan hound voiced by Kathryn Hahn, who Bull adores but doesn’t think he can satisfy, despite her flirtatious advances.Their inhibited and surprisingly sentimental romance actually gives Fixed a bit of heart, leading Bull on a journey of self-discovery where he learns to let go of his balls and embrace everything he could become without them. Too bad it takes so long for Bull, and the movie, to heed that very lesson.Fixed is available on Netflix 13 AugustExplore more on these topicsAnimation in filmComedy filmsComedyNetflixreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not dissimilar to those sentimental anthropomorphic shows that add narrative to footage of deer and rabbits. The story begins moments after Bambi’s birth, and he is adorable – all knock-kneed charm and massive eyes.The production wisely eschews the intricacies of dialogue, so the players express themselves much as silent actors. They get particular mileage out of a very knowing crow: its limited appearances recall the scene-stealing performances of a Judi Dench or Maggie Smith. A rabbit seems a little at sea in a key secondary role that requires more chemistry. Thumper’s shadow from the 1942 Disney cartoon is long. I suspect this rabbit was cast for looks, not acting chops.The target audience is no doubt younger children, but drug-addled students might like to add this one to the roster – it is extremely mellow. Apart, of course, from the Great Tragedy, which lands with bleak emotional punch worthy of Werner Herzog, as the narrator intones: “Sadness is a deep coldness on the inside, and he doesn’t know yet that it will last for ever.” Yikes.Perhaps this film is the movie equivalent of the beautiful wooden toys kids reject in favour of something loud and luminous. But for parents who can’t face another lurid cartoon, this is the (mostly) chilled-out alternative.Bambi: A Tale of Life in the Woods is in UK and Irish cinemas from 15 August.Explore more on these topicsFamily filmsFilm adaptationsBambiAnimalsFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Screenwriter-producer Michèle Marshall has adapted 2014 novelThe Living and the Dead in Winsford by veteran Swedish crime writer Håkan Nesser, and Caroline Ingvarsson makes her feature directing debut.The scene is the stylish home of a Swedish power couple. Maria (Mirja Turestedt) is the presenter of an popular TV talkshow, and she is married to the older Magnus (Thomas W Gabrielsson), a star academic with a drinking problem and a seedy reputation for infidelity. Maria is a former student of Magnus and has, in fact, surpassed him intellectually, now faintly despising herself for her middlebrow job as well as for editing and almost secretly co-writing papers for Magnus, who grumpily relies on her help. But Maria despises herself still more for standing by Magnus despite a rape charge against him. With an ugly, boorish defiance, Magnus intends to brazen it out legally and claim consent; in her heart, Maria does not believe him.Things come to a crisis when the couple are driving through Poland after visiting an old friend of his, quarrelling constantly. They stop to look at an abandoned military bunker and things take a terrible turn. A series of flashbacks and a final, tense conversation with a police inspector are to disclose most (but, bafflingly, not quite all) of what is supposed to have happened. The audience are perhaps entitled to ask what precisely went on in the bunker, given that a final moment-by-moment revelation does seem to be implicitly promised; there are odd plot points that have been telescoped and garbled, possibly lost in the edit. Disappointing overall, but a strong performance from Turestedt.Unmoored is in UK and Irish cinemas from 15 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsCrime filmsFilm adaptationsSwedenEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

She stood mid-growl, clutching the mic as if to throttle it, her silhouette framed by a red LED screen that read “Rock Nights” along with the name of the artist: Clayrocksu.Beneath the stage at Pop Landmark in Lagos,Nigeria, a sparse crowd of silver-studded misfits was filmed thrashing around in a trance. The performance provoked a small moral panic in the comments: cries of “demonic” and fears that Clayrocksu was “slipping into darkness”.The darkness Clayrocksu and others move through isn’t occult, though – it’s obscurity. In the west, goth and emo subcultures offer outsiders a name, a tribe, but in Nigeria they barely exist. The industry here forgets itself every few decades, and since the rise of Afrobeat, and later Afrobeats, rock has been sealed off or paved over. But it’s kept alive by DIY shows such as Clayrocksu’s Rock Nights series, WhatsApp chats, shared gear, and today’s small scene – bands such as LoveSick, ASingerMustDie and the Recurrence – is raw and defiant.Long before Clayrocksu et al ever screamed into a mic, Nigerians were shaping rock to their own rhythm. Between 1967 and 1970, Nigeria fought a brutal civil war after the south-eastern region declared itself the Republic of Biafra. In the aftermath, the Hygrades, who lit up the 1970s with tracks like In the Jungle, came from the east along with the Funkees and the Doves – post–Biafran war kids with guitars, trying to turn trauma into sound. These early bands still leaned on the swagger of Hendrix and the snarl of Jagger, but it wasn’t until Fela Kuti – fierce, lyrical, unmistakably ours – that Afro-rock began to speak in a Nigerian voice.But more immediately palatable pop, dance and gospel came to fill the airwaves, while rock had no radio, no label push, no hype. Still, it lived on in the margins, and more recently fan-led WhatsApp groups such as Rockaz World and Rock Republic have kept the flame going, along with the now-defunct Naija School of Rock blog. Clayrocksu isn’t just a musician and now a member of the Recording Academy in the US, whose members vote for the Grammys; she’s also an ambassador for the scene who set up the collective Afrorockstars in 2024. It’s a kind of Justice League for Lagos’s indie rock scene, where artists band together, host shows, and keep the flame alive.With her monthly Rock Nights series on hold due to a lack of funding, Clayrocksu has teamed up with Lagos venue Kevwe and Cam for a band showcase called Lagos Misfits Takeover. I head there to find what is left of Nigerian rock.“I don’t remember a time when I wasn’t into rock,” Clayrocksu says before going on stage. As a kid, she played bootleg pop-rock CDs on her Walkman. Her dad was a rock head, too – less edgy metal, more Bon Jovi and Michael Bolton – but when Clayrocksu started covering his favourites, she finally got it. “I can’t explain it,” she says of her love of rock. “The music called to me, and I want others to feel that, too.”She’s unfazed by the moral panic she unleashed. “I don’t pay it any mind, honestly,” she says. For the Afrorockstars community, “rock is just part of life, same as their faith”. She pauses, fingers grazing the crucifix around her neck. “Some of them wear crosses, too.”She introduces me to LoveSick’s frontman Korny, a 31-year-old, soft-spoken man with a bald head and a Jason Voorhees–style hockey mask clipped to his pants, his lucky charm. “I bought it the night we won Battle of the Bands,” he says, referring to a Lagos event late last year, which was LoveSick’s first ever live performance. “I used my last cash to buy it from a vendor who said everything she sells is blessed. I wore it, we played and we won triple what I paid.”He looks every bit the nerdy IT solutions guy, but that changes when he takes the mic and growls through Guiding, a track whose lyrics – “I’ve got 5k [Naira, about £2.50] left in my bank account” – are about surviving Nigeria as a broke youth.The sound at the venue is rough, but “we can’t wait for perfect sound like Afrobeats,” Korny shrugs. “The show must go on.” His voice – guttural, sharp, sometimes screeching – feels scorched. “I taught myself back in 2011,” he says. “Just mimicking my favourites.” They were Korn’s Jonathan Davis, Linkin Park’s Chester Bennington, Asking Alexandria’s Danny Worsnop. Now, he cycles through screams, growls and pig squeals. “It’s not noise,” he says. “It’s a voice. A message.”View image in fullscreenBrother duo ASingerMustDieAlso playing at Kevwe and Cam is brother duo ASingerMustDie. “Hope y’all are ready to die tonight,” one of them deadpans into the mic. The venue’s walls are lined with portraits of legends like Oliver De Coque and Fela Kuti, watching over the night’s rising acts, and ASingerMustDie’s set feels distinctly Nigerian – rock as the vessel, but with a message rooted in lived experience. “It’s all about feelings, experiences, societal issues,” the brothers tell me. Their song Córazon, for instance, was born from a toxic love story and the fear that leaving would hurt more than staying.Phones light up during LoveSick’s set, and again for Clayrocksu, as fans look to prove they were here. Xavier, a fan of LoveSick, says he’s been into rock for about 13 years: he first heard it on Need for Speed and Fifa, and it hit him like nothing else. “Power chords and riffs break from traditional music patterns – they’re chaotic, but beautiful,” he says. “In a place as chaotic as Nigeria, rock helped me make sense of it all.”For this crowd, it isn’t just music, it’s making space to feel seen in a country that doesn’t reward difference. “Even if you don’t sing rock,” Clayrocksu tells me, “you can still be one of the cool kids with us.”ASingerMustDie’s new EP Songs to Die For is released 25 AugustExplore more on these topicsMetalPop and rockNigeriafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But he’s not unhappy to do so.The Gods of New Yorktells how the DemocratEd Kochsought a fourth term as mayor but by election year, 1989, was widely seen as an “incumbent plagued by scandal, just like Eric Adams now”, Mahler said.“We hadRudy Giuliani, the tough guy from the outer boroughs – in Giuliani’s case Brooklyn, now in Andrew Cuomo’s case, Queens. And then we had the candidate of color who was saying: ‘I’m going to take the city back for the people who are getting left out.’ It was David Dinkins then and it’s Zohran Mamdani now.”Wary of generalization, as befits a veteranNew YorkTimes reporter, Mahler nonetheless said that as the city “went through a big transformation” from 1986-90, so “it’s going through another now.”‘New York plows ahead’: how the English invaded and changed a cityRead moreThe Gods of New York is a sequel of sorts toLadies and Gentlemen, the Bronx is Burning, Mahler’s book about the city in crisis in the late 70s. Turning to the late 80s, Mahler presents a riot of stories from a period beset by racial tensions, the crack epidemic, soaring crime, sensational cases and an economic boom overwhelmingly boosting the rich. Keeping ordinary New Yorkers in mind, Mahler nonetheless presents extraordinary characters.“I will confess I went back and forth on the title, which was suggested by a friend,” Mahler said. “I thought: ‘That’s the perfect title.’ And then a handful of people were like: ‘You can’t possibly call it The Gods of New York. Are you sayingDonald Trumpis a god? And Rudy?”Forty years ago, no one foresaw the Trump of today: occupying the White House, dividing America, Giuliani a shameless sidekick.“I was like: ‘Well, not gods in that sense. This is much more like the Greek gods. They were kind of on their own tabloid Mount Olympus. Really, what I meant was that [Trump, Giuliani and others] were looming over the city like gods, not necessarily benevolent. Remember, the Greek gods were … wrathful, vengeful and petty. That was definitely what I was going for. Less literal, more figurative. So I stuck with it.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump in 1987.Photograph: Joe McNally/Getty ImagesReaders could do worse than make The Gods of New York a double bill withPaper of Wreckage, an acclaimed oral history of Rupert Murdoch’s New York Post published last year, a chronicle of the gutter press and the stars.“All the characters were operating from the same playbook, in a way,” Mahler said of a cast that contains others still prominent, among them Spike Lee, then shooting his remarkable first films in Brooklyn, and the Rev Al Sharpton, a Black leader through theHoward Beach racist attack, theTawana Brawley rape hoaxand other scandals once boiling, now near-forgotten.‘He didn’t think he was a good man’: new book reveals unseen portrait of JFKRead more“They were all trying to get the city’s attention and use that attention. We now use the term ‘attention economy’ all the time. This was really kind of the beginning of the attention economy and all these characters kind of intuitively understood that.The gay rights campaignerLarry Kramer“was organizing these incredibly in-your-face protests against the city and the country’s handling of Aids [that were] no different, in a way, from what Trump was doing and is still doing, which is trying to get people’s attention and keep it, trying to start a story and keep it going.“I’m not sure that I would have seen that parallel if I hadn’t seen Trump do it in 2016 when … I was working on reporting the [presidential] campaign. It was kind of crazy to watch him get elected, particularly as a New Yorker.”Working on The Gods of New York, Mahler saw Trump “using the same power to its ultimate effect: the insistence that he is never wrong, that you just keep moving forward. You act bulletproof, then you are bulletproof. I don’t know that I would have understood what he was doing in the 80s and what all these guys were doing if I hadn’t seen it play out on the biggest stage in recent years.”Kramerdied in 2020, after giving a last interview to Mahler. In 2024, Trump surged back to power. Amid the fire and fury of the second term, reading about Trump in the 80s can feel a little jarring. As Mahler shows, even the Times was once drawn in.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Penguin Random House“There’s a great note in the Abe Rosenthal papers,” Mahler said, referring to thelong-serving editor. “A staff member wrote him a note saying: ‘No wonder Donald Trump has such a huge ego: I don’t think anyone’s ever got on the cover of so many New York Times sections in such a short period of time.’“I guess in some ways that’s a failure on the part of the Times to see whoDonald Trumpwas, but I think also the context is important. In that moment, New York was recovering from some really dark days. The city was in a real death spiral for years. And then along comes this guy ready to invest in New York in audacious ways, really doubling down on the city.“And so you can sort of understand why, if you’re an institution like the New York Times that is very connected to New York, much more so then than today … they might feel like: ‘Well, this guy believes in New York, he’s betting on New York,’ and you can see how that might earn him some goodwill.”Mahler also documents Trump’sdisastrous fixationwithAtlantic City, which heutterly failedto turn into a gambling hub, to his considerable cost; his callous treatment of women; his notorious call for the Central Park Five, Black youths ultimately shown to have been falsely convicted of rape,to be sentenced to death.Crime stories run through Mahler’s book. Theso-called Preppy Murderalso centers on Central Park, where Jennifer Levin’s body was discovered. ProsecutorLinda Fairsteinemerges as a thwarted hero, aghast at suspect Robert Chambers’ protection by the Catholic church and escape from the harshest sentence. And yet Fairstein went on to help subject the Central Park Five to a historic miscarriage of justice.New book sheds light on Lincoln’s misunderstood killer: ‘He’s not that person at all’Read more“She was sodemonizedafter the Central Park Five,” Mahler said. “I think it was interesting to see these two cases sort of as a pair, and the way in which Fairstein was so bitter about how the Chambers case played out … and then not even a couple years later, she’s confronted with the chance to sort of make amends. Not that this was a conscious decision, but you could see how maybe she was more zealous than she should have been [regarding the Central Park Five], because she felt … unsatisfied with the resolution of the Chambers case.”A man who held the stage longer than most, Koch, is perhaps Mahler’s central character. At the start, the mayor is riding high. By the end, he’s been brought low.Mahler said: “His third term was pretty clearly a disaster. But I think of him as a really sympathetic character … someone who was so flawed but also so committed to New York … he really cared about the city. I think that’s a good lens through which to see hisfeud with Trump[over Trump’s real-estate plays], because Trump was in it for Trump and Koch knew that was not in the best interest of New York.”Koch will also be known to history for being gay but not coming out, his mayoralty covering the worst years of the Aids epidemic, campaigners such as Kramer raging.View image in fullscreenEd Koch listening to music on radio in Central Park.Photograph: New York Daily News Archive/NY Daily News/Getty ImagesMahler tells that story, counting himself “very fortunate that the Times did abig piece a couple years agoabout Koch’s sexuality, and kind of outed him. I feel like now … we all know this is how it was.”Was Koch a good mayor?“I think you would have to say yes and no,” Mahler said. “Though I’m not sure he had any other choice, as he had to do something to save the city, he set in motion this transformation, this shift toward private business that I guess we’re now seeing the sort of reaction against, with Zohran.”We’re back to the current campaign. Thirty-six years ago, in the election that ends Mahler’s book, Dinkins beat Koch in the Democratic primary then seized the big prize. Mahler rates the city’sfirst Black mayoras a good one “dealt a terrible hand”, the same fate that befell Benjamin Ward, the city’sfirst Black police commissioner. Dinkins served one term, losing to Giuliani in 1993. The city’s transformation continued. It always will, which helps make The Gods of New York such an enthralling read.

Born in 1862, he began his working life as a school master at Eton, before moving on in 1904 to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he was first a fellow and then master.Notably, he left voluminous diaries – over four million words, filling 180 bound volumes – four times the length of the diaries of Samuel Pepys, who had been an undergraduate at Magdalene. Benson was well connected and knew most of the political and literary elite of late Victorian and Edwardian Britain, so one might have expected him to offer a similarly unrivalled portrait of the age. Many believe that he did: one review of these two edited volumes declares that because of them, he has entered “the diarists’ pantheon”.But though he met plenty of writers and other figures of note, he has little of value to say about them. Indeed his literary judgments are crass when not philistine: Henry James’s “idea of art was to tell a tale that few could understand or to present figures so faint & vague as seldom to be more than hypothetical”; Arnold Bennett was “a cad”; of Housman: “I don’t think he is quite a gentleman”.His musical opinions were even worse. In a concert that included works by Weber, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Brahms and Tchaikovsky, he declared the best work to be one by Waldemar Bargiel, a composer otherwise unknown to history; while, “fifty years hence people will probably talk of Wagner as claptrap and wonder how anyone could admire”.Zsa Zsa Gabor once remarked that Britain was a country of boys and old boys: this is a book for the old boysHis outlook is that of an Edwardian clubman; and indeed, the only England Benson knew well, apart from Eton, Cambridge and the court at Windsor Castle, was the smoke-filled rooms of Pall Mall, a world largely without women. Benson did not much like women and was not at ease with them, preferring the company of handsome young men. The editors go to great pains to argue that Benson, while certainly homoerotic, was not actively homosexual. But, really, who cares?Eamon Duffy and Ronald Hyam are, unlike Benson, distinguished academics. They have bestowed on these diaries all the apparatus of contemporary research, treating the commonplace utterances of obscure dons as if they came from great statesmen – but to what end? Anyone with misplaced nostalgia for a supposedly golden age of civilised living – an age that fortunately is long gone and which no one of sense would wish to see resurrected – may enjoy immersing themselves in Benson’s observations. But they would have to be almost as steeped in a certain crusted-over establishment atmosphere as he was. Zsa Zsa Gabor once remarked that Britain was a country of boys and old boys: this is a book for the old boys.In truth, these diaries are a monument of misplaced scholarship. No doubt the question of whether the master’s children should be allowed to use the Fellows’ Garden was a matter of great moment to the dons in May 1914 but its historical import is unclear. The account of college squabbles lacks even the waspishness that we find, for example, in the letters of AJP Taylor or Hugh Trevor-Roper. They at least serve to confirm Henry Kissinger’s dictum that academic disputes are so vicious precisely because the stakes are so low. What the diaries offer, as was once said – perhaps unfairly – of Trollope, is the sedative of gossip. They provide the illusion that one is in communion with great writers and powerful people, but it’s one we shouldn’t fall for.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The village of Chandley is “small” and “complicated”, he says warmly. “Everyone’s got their own story.” The action cuts between cosy, wooden cottages and a moss-covered forest filled with folkloric creatures. We see the protagonist, a horticulturist wizard “steeped in the green and growing arts”, returning home and tending to an abundance of vegetables. Some you’ll find in your local supermarket; others are of a decidedly more magical variety.As a rural life simulation, Mandrake is odder and more beguiling than most. It possesses the same undeniable allure as classics such as Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley, inviting players to slip into the seasonal flow of crop cultivation, countryside exploration and conversations with suspiciously cheerful townsfolk. But there’s more going on here: lush, painterly visuals to start. And should you tire of tilling the soil, you might wander off the beaten path of this mythical, Brythonic-inspired land, perhaps eavesdropping on the dead or even befriending a river.View image in fullscreenCosy cultivation … Mandrake.Photograph: Failbetter GamesWeirdness is to be expected in a new release from Failbetter, the boutique UK studio behind acclaimed titles Fallen London and Sunless Sea. Set in a shared fictional universe, that narrative RPG and moody survival experience, respectively, were masterclasses in evocative prose and captivating world-building. London became “Fallen”, submerged in a darkened underworld called the Neath, newly situated on the coast of a vast, black ocean – the so-called Unterzee.These games, horrifying and hilarious in nearly equal measure, were rooted in a deft sense of place. Mandrake foregrounds location in a friendlier, more accessible way. The beauty of the rural life sim, as game director Adam Myers sees it, is that “you’re able to zoom in on one community over time”. Across days, nights and seasons, the player bears witness to a changing place and its people. You go from a sense of total unfamiliarity, says Myers, to having developed a deep knowledge of the environment.But Mandrake aims to eschew the genre’s grindier tendencies – cultivating acres of wheat and making multiple daily meals. “It isn’t optimal to grow your crops in large rectangular monocultures,” says Myers. “And you’re not doing the thing where you click 30 times and carry a banquet’s worth of ratatouille around in your inventory at all times.”View image in fullscreenComplicating rural the rural sim … Mandrake.Photograph: Failbetter GamesGift-giving, the typical way players ingratiate themselves with their NPC neighbours in this genre, arrives with a wrinkle. Players cannot just hand out presents randomly (“That’s a little awkward,” laughs Myers). Instead, they must declare why they are handing out their offerings. This forms the start of a relationship based on obligation.The aim is to not just replicate the pattern seen in other rural life sims, but “complicate” it, both through thoughtful mechanics and an unusual set of influences. Myers talks enthusiastically of anthropology, British folklore and esoteric traditions such as Renaissance alchemy. The world is filled with quirky and mysterious lore: it is inhabited by “quasi-monastic organisations” and despite the Welsh influences in the landscape, there is an eerie absence of sheep.The comforting rituals of the rural life sim seem to function as a Trojan horse for Failbetter’s peculiar and offbeat tendencies. “One of the error patterns we’ve fallen into in the past is going too weird, too fast, too soon,” admits Myers. “We need to give players more stable ground to stand on so they can make sense of everything – put the pieces together to properly appreciate what’s unusual and strange.”Ominous creatures undoubtedly lurk in these ancient woods; villagers are likely to conceal many portentous secrets. It’s reasonable to assume that Myers’s and his colleagues’ taste for the macabre surfaces in some manner. But there’s a crucial difference, a concession, perhaps, to maintaining what he hopes is a welcoming and “emotionally gentle” tone: unlike some of Failbetter’s other games, death doesn’t lurk quite so close to your shoulder. Or as Myers puts it, “you probably won’t be able to get yourself eaten in this one”.Mandrake is in development for PC with console support planned.

The stars of a variety night do not normally count gherkins, onions and carrots among their number, not even lower down the bill. We might also share an interest in what creator and performer Ruxandra Cantir has to say about the obsession with pickling in her native Moldova.But what next? That Cantir chooses to remain tight-lipped about the culinary habits of her home country is no big deal, nor even the little this show says about the theme of life, death and preservation. That she has so few ideas about what to do with her pickled vegetables having introduced them, surely is.They look striking. Designed by Fergus Dunnet in Shona Reppe’s production, part of the Made in Scotland showcase, they are bold and imaginatively conceived. To play an onion, she yanks a white knitted jumper over her head and reveals a tuft of stringy hair. Her potato is a dirty amorphous lump, its chits growing over the course of the show. The gherkin is huge, tall, erect, very green – and likes dancing.The tomatoes are just tomatoes and with each punchline of a corny joke they get pulped into ketchup.View image in fullscreenImaginatively conceived … Ruxandra Cantir and Yvonne Strain in Pickled Republic.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianSo far so striking, but with the exception of some lipsyncing to a witty song by John Kielty and an apocalyptic speech by a baby carrot, she has nowhere to take her creations. She uses clown and mime techniques to illustrate being trapped in a pickle jar, timidly suffering unrequited love or anxiously waiting to be picked for consumption, but too few ideas to justify the length of each scene.Rather, the show is reliant on the enthusiasm of an admittedly willing audience to slip into cabaret mode and cheer on each new vegetable as though it were a work of genius. Without their whoops and hollers, it would seem a very thin piece of work.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)CabaretSummerhallreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now they have been turned into an extraordinary playHelen MeanyTue 12 Aug 2025 10.10 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 12.13 EDTShareIn Vasenka, a fictional town under military occupation, a deaf boy is shot by soldiers and the town’s inhabitants become deaf in response. The opening of Deaf Republic – the remarkable second collection by the Ukrainian-American poet and translatorIlya Kaminsky– sets in train a narrative of resistance through silence, as “deafness, an insurgency, begins” and the soldiers start executing the citizens of Vasenka, who refuse to hear their orders.Since its publication in 2019, Deaf Republic has won multiple awards and been critically lauded for what the former poet laureateAndrew Motionhas described as “a folk drama that feels archetypal, yet is deeply revealing of our here and now”. That quality of being current, urgent in its commentary on war yet as timeless as a fable, appealed to Bush Moukarzel and Ben Kidd, co-directors of theatre companyDead Centre, who have adapted the work for stage.“Kaminsky’s genius is to make the reader feel they understand more than they do,” says Kidd in between rehearsals in Dublin. “Yet some of the poems are inscrutable. The choice to use a story, the narrative of what happens to the townspeople, is important. Then he drops in his lyric poems and you’re stopped short. There are two things going on formally, and it suggests itself as a piece that could be adapted.”Kaminsky, who lost his own hearing as a child and did not have hearing aids until he moved to the US in his teens, also incorporates sign language symbols into his text, which are a mixture of American and Ukrainian signs. In the book he wanted to reflect his experience of being an immigrant in the US, while also frequently returning toUkraine.“I was living with one foot in both places,” he says, speaking online from the US. To reflect this, the central narrative is bookended by two poems – We Lived Happily During the War and In a Time of Peace – that echo each other and transpose the image of the body of a dead boy lying on a pavement from the fictional Vasenka to the US today.View image in fullscreen‘There are layers of theatre-within-theatre in it’ ... from left: Kate Finegan, Lisa Kelly, Romel Belcher, Caoimhe Coburn Gray and Eoin Gleeson in rehearsals.Photograph: Johnny Corcoran“What is complicated is seeing these images of violence in one of the poorest countries in Europe [Ukraine] and one of the richest countries in the world,” says Kaminsky. “I realised I needed to change the genre I’m writing in. I needed a genre that speaks to both sides of my life. So the book is a kind of fairytale, it’s dream time, a fantasia. A fairytale was a necessity, to speak about both these landscapes, Ukraine and the US.”British Sign Language is for prose, whereas Visual Vernacular is much closer to poetry“There are layers of theatre-within-theatre in it,” Moukarzel says. “The way it is presented, with the first line ‘Our country is the stage’, the list of dramatis personae of townspeople and the puppet theatre run by the character of Momma Galya, all this adds theatricality. We were intrigued. But we wondered if it was ethical to adapt it: was it our story to tell, especially the deaf experience? That gave us pause. We needed to build the right team.”Thankfully, the two directors have history when it comes topushing boundarieson stage. Their show Beckett’s Room told the story of the apartment in Paris where Samuel Beckett lived with his partner Suzanne during the second world war without using any live actors.In this production there will be an ensemble created from deaf and hearing actors, along with aerial performers, live cinema and poetry, using a mix of spoken English, British Sign Language (BSL), Irish Sign Language and creative captioning. On the day I sat in on a rehearsal, there was also a slightly out of control drone and some beautifully crafted string puppets making a tentative appearance.View image in fullscreen‘I needed a genre that speaks to both sides of my life’ … Ilya Kaminsky.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverWatching keenly was Zoë McWhinney, a deaf poet and actor who co-authored the script with Kidd and Moukarzel. “We gave each other a lot of freedom from the start,” McWhinney says, speaking through an interpreter. She used BSL to work on the rough script, recording herself on video. “In some ways, it is BSL-led, rather than spoken English,” she says. McWhinney also brought in Visual Vernacular (VV) – a form of performance art that draws on sign language, mime and theatre.“BSL is for conversation, for prose, whereas VV is much closer to poetry,” says McWhinney. “There is a rhythm and pace to it. Through gesture and movement, facial expressions, hand movement, you can see the image: you’re almost personifying the language.”For Kaminsky, it was Dead Centre’s innovative approach to adapting nonfiction that appealed to him. “The way they spoke about implicating the audience was fascinating to me. I thought, ‘I’m getting an education here, keep it coming!’ I didn’t want to see a Xerox copy of my book. It’s up to them to create their own art form; otherwise the energy gets stiff. And I want the energy to be electric.”Deaf Republic is atRoyal Court theatre, London, 29 August-13 September, then at the Samuel Beckett theatre, Dublin, 2-5 October, as part ofDublin Theatre festivalExplore more on these topicsTheatreDeafness and hearing lossPoetryPolitical theatreUkraineIrelandRoyal Court theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

An off-grid Scottish town called Brigadoon is untouched by time and magically returns for one day every hundred years. No one can leave or else the town disappears forever. When two Americans, Jeff (Cavan Clarke) and Tommy (Louis Gaunt), unknowingly stumble across it and the latter falls in love with Fiona (Danielle Fiamanya on press night), it is all set for a love story with a Shyamalan-like twist (The Village with bagpipes?).Rona Munro’s adaptation does not make enough of this potential, although there is initial promise.The American interlopers are not the hunters of the original story but second world war pilots who have crashed in the Highlands. Tommy is injured, Jeff mentally scarred by war – or so it is intimated. But this goes nowhere beyond a few passing comments (“Wars happen and people get lost inside them,” says Fiona).Instead this too tame, too purposeless revival seems simply to be a love letter to Scotland with bagpipes and drumming galore. Granted, that is part of atmosphere-building but there is little of substance beneath it.View image in fullscreenGo Home With Bonnie Jean … L to r, Chrissy Brooke (Maggie Anderson), Danny Nattrass (Harry Beaton) and cast in Brigadoon.Photograph: Mark SeniorSo it swims in its own aspic rather like Brigadoon itself. Directed by Drew McOnie, the story seems missing for so long, with song after soupy song. Characters are either barely or bluntly defined, from Fiona to her sister Jean (Jasmine Jules Andrews), who is getting married, and the wench-like Meg (Nic Myers)who tries to woo Jeff. Tommy and Jeff are chirpy but characterless.The cast is filled with strong singers, albeit approximate Scottish accents, but the songs sound anodyne and generic, from I’ll Go Home With Bonnie Jean to The Heather on the Hill. Performers run on and off stage, place heather on it and remove it again. McOnie’s choreography is beautiful and balletic in itself, like a love letter to the 1954 Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse film and so is Basia Bińkowska’s tiered wooden set. There is a twirling romance to Almost Like Being in Love and an expressive dance by Maggie (Chrissy Brooke) as she mourns the death of villager Harry (Danny Nattrass). But prolonged movement either swallows up the story or stands in for it.There is the potential for complex characterisation in Harry, who fulminates on Jean’s wedding day before declaring he is leaving Brigadoon – thereby threatening its existence. This turns a seemingly happy community into an Ursula Le Guin-style dystopia where villagers must put collective happiness above individual fulfilment – rather likeLe Guin’s characters in Omelas. The chase that follows, to stop him, should be chilling but you feel nothing of the tension, or greater moral issues, here.So it is song and dance in search of a story. No miracles happen here, sadly.AtRegent’s Park Open Air theatre, London, until 20 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsStageMusicalsTheatreRona MunroreviewsShareReuse this content"

She greets us with a fixed, manic smile on her face – the mask of her wonderfully honed stage persona, charming and determinedly upbeat on the surface, with something steelier glinting beneath.That persona mirrors the show itself, its surface patterned with dreamlike detours and sparkling one-liners, the tendrils of darker truths rising at choice moments.An ex is painted as someone with a rigid sense of how things should be. He valued rationality and normalcy; she embraced creativity and astrology. The show charts her realisation that this wasn’t a good match, that she was never truly accepted, and hints at the effects of having your sanity questioned by someone you loved.There are surreal moments – her imagined life as one of the mice infesting her flat, her unorthodox solution to childbirth – and routines that take us from her childhood to the current disarray of her London life. One segment on the regularity with which she overhears her waifish flatmate having vigorous sex is particularly fun, her irreverent delivery bringing every line to life.Bad dates and bath bombs: 10 of the funniest jokes from the Edinburgh fringe 2025Read moreIt’s this combination of sharp writing and precise performance that makes Hull’s show such a joy to watch. Jokes are piled on jokes, finding surprising angles on everything from personal trainers to plastic waste and Samuel Beckett. She paints a vivid picture of childhood years spent living with her grandma, a barefoot clairvoyant who introduced her to a “diabetic revenge horse”, while a poetic monologue is spun from a family holiday and sets up a memorable visual finale.Hull proves revenge is a dish best served stuffed full of punchlines, with a side of the occult.AtMonkey Barrel (The Hive), Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Apple-cheeked andfoul-mouthed, she is gracious with the passing stranger, though she warns me later: “If somebody pisses me off, I’ll say: ‘Now listen to me, I’m 84!’” She pauses. “But I don’t see why they should!” she adds with a laugh.Margolyes is returning to Edinburgh for the second year running with an upgraded version of heracclaimed showcase based on the characters of Charles Dickens, her favourite author. “Same old cunt, even older,” reads the flyer. “It could be the last time, but don’t bank on it!”Fringe benefits from Miriam Margolyes for the Cambridge Footlights | Brief lettersRead moreTheEdinburgh festivalfringe is world-famous for the diversity of its acts, but industry and media attention is easily distracted and the appetite for bold new talent and fresh voices often equates – deliberately or otherwise – with youth. Yet this year offers a “brigade of old gits”, as the actor Andy Linden says, some of them veterans such as Margolyes who first performed there with Cambridge University Footlights in 1963, and others remarkably making their debuts in their 70s and 80s.“I’m very lucky,” says Margolyes, whose legion of fans straddle generations and have delighted in her performances in Blackadder, Harry Potter and her appearances on The Graham Norton Show. “There’s relatively few people of my age still working.” And there is “nothing like a live audience”, she adds: “It’s like a kiss, it’s a caress.”“I just enjoy doing it so much,” she continues, running through some of the characters she brings to the stage with “shape-shifting flair”, as one reviewer put it. “My favourites like Mrs Gamp, Miss Havisham, I think I’m a perfect person to give voice to these amazing creations of which there were very many. So it’s a bit of a wank, really,” she concludes cheerily.View image in fullscreen‘You’ve got to pace yourself’ … Andy Linden.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianMargolyes describes an “immediate feeling of joy and competence” when she steps out in front of an audience these days. Has she always felt as if she knows what she’s doing on stage? “No, it has come with time. What I am conscious of now is that people know who I am and that is really relatively recent.”Just as confidence comes with age, so does a responsibility to use her profile to speak out on behalf of those who don’t have such a platform. Most recently Margolyes, who is Jewish, has faced a backlash for her stridentcriticism of the actions of the Israeli government in Gaza.“People say: ‘You’re just an actor, for fuck’s sake, shut up.’ Well, that is a point of view. I don’t happen to share that. I think that if you have a chance to make an impact for good, to change things, then you should. I think it’s an absolute requirement, and people don’t, out of fear sometimes. They are afraid of being cancelled. You can’t cancel me!” she says.Just off a flight from Australia, where she lives part-time with her partner, and suffering from “punishing” jet lag along with a recent back injury, Margolyes admits that life on the road can be tiring. “I’m gathering my powers and I will deliver, but it is a struggle.”Also appearing at Edinburgh this year is Linden, a veteran character actor and one of Margolyes’s Harry Potter co-stars, who played the horcrux thief Mundungus Fletcher. This year marks the 40th anniversary of his Edinburgh debut in 1985. Now 71, when Linden last performed at the festival in 2022, he suffered a big respiratory attack and ended up in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.You don’t retire from the profession, the profession retires youAndy LindenHaving been told by his doctor in no uncertain terms that “next time it happens I’d need a hearse not an ambulance”, Linden is embarking on his first booze- and cigarette-free festival as he returns with Baxter vs the Bookies, a show he wrote and performs himself, charting the fortunes of an ageing horse-racing tipster bamboozled by modern technology.“In the past we gloriously defiled ourselves one way or another, but as the years unfold experience takes a hand,” he says with some forbearance. “Edinburgh is the Grand National, not a five-furlong sprint and whether you’re young or old you’ve got to pace yourself.”Linden’s advice for performers of any age is to take a few days off during the run: “Edinburgh can be very insular so try to do something a little different, go up the coast. I go to the football and watch Hearts or Hibs. Don’t do 30 days nonstop.”The festival has changed mightily in scale since he first performed here, and has become “fiercely competitive”. But ageism is not a concern for Linden: the “brigade of old gits” he is referring to includes Ivor Dembina, Stephen Frost, Mark Arden and Mark Thomas.“You don’t retire from the profession,” he says, “the profession retires you.” And until that happens, he plans to start work in October on a new character project about a boxing cornerman.View image in fullscreen‘You take more creative risks’ ... Vivienne Powell(left)and Christine Thynne.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianOthers are making their debut here. I come to the Assembly Rooms bar to meet two women who are sitting poised on high stools. Vivienne Powell, 76, has just emerged from the first performance of her solo show Diva, about an opera singer with dementia battling to reclaim her memories through music. Christine Thynne, 82, a retired physiotherapist who took her first dance class at 68, is embarking on the first full run of her choreographed performance These Mechanisms.It’s a physically challenging dance piece involving scaffolding planks and stepladders. Does Thynne rub up against expectations of how a woman of her age ought to behave or what she is even capable of? She laughs. “At 82, people say: ‘You shouldn’t be going up a stepladder, somebody else should be changing the lightbulbs!’”Powell adds: “Our society is pretty ageist, in a lot of ways.Older peoplecan be quite dismissed for what they can contribute, particularly women. So, to be doing our own shows at the fringe at a more mature age is pretty amazing.”Thynne concurs: “When you look back over the programmes of past years, I don’t know that there have been many elderly women who have done a full show.”Yet the pair remain largely unfazed by their own trajectories. “It can be quite common with women”, Powell argues, “who don’t come into themselves until their 40s or 50s. And they discover talents, interests that they didn’t know they had. They start a whole new chapter of their lives.” Having worked as a teacher while raising her three children in Sydney, Australia, latterly as a single parent, Powell gave her first professional opera recital in her early 40s and later acted on stage, in TV and film in Los Angeles.Do Powell and Thynne believe they are braver as performers because of their age and experience? “Definitely,” insists Powell. “You take more creative risks.”“My piece is completely about creative risks,” agrees Thynne. “From the beginning where I’m lying on a scaffolding plank and turning over its width. That’s the essence of the creativity, because the audience wonder what is going to happen next, then they realise: this isn’t an elderly person, this is an exciting piece of work.”There should be no age limit to creativity, says Powell. Her advice to those still contemplating their next chapter is straightforward: “Follow your heart, do what you love.” She raises one finger for emphasis: “And don’t settle.”Thynne says: “Even if you’re bringing up children and juggling all these different things and the ups and downs of life, still follow your dream. And be very, very positive about that!”Both women’s grandchildren will see their shows. Powell reads hers a George Eliot quote: “It’s never too late to be what you might have been.”Margolyes and Dickens: More Best Bitsis at Pentland theatre at Pleasance at EICC until 24 August.Baxter vs the Bookiesis at Gilded Balloon Patter House until 25 August.Divais at Assembly Rooms, Drawing Room, until 24 August.These Mechanismsis atDance Base until 20 AugustDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Pods, pulp, paste, concentrate … I can’t keep up with them all.David, via emailHow doesChaya Maya, development chef atOttolenghi Test Kitchen, love tamarind? Let her count the ways: “It’sdelicious, plus you can use it in sweet and savoury dishes, or to make lemonade, which we do in Mauritius; it has that sour sharpness that makes your mouth tingle. Actually, we need a tamarind movement.” Also in favour of the pucker fruit isMelissa Thompson, author ofMotherland, namely for its “lovely consistency” and ability to “coat things nicely” while adding “depth”.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As David says, tamarind comes in various forms, but let’s start at the very beginning with those peanut-shaped pods, which Thompson likes to snack on – just crack open the shell and eat the flesh. “When I started cheffing, I wanted to do all the processes myself, so I’d buy a box of pods, peel them, soak them and mash them, which took so long!” Perhaps unsurprisingly, these days she prefers a compressed block, which also happens to be Maya’s go-to: “You have to hydrate it, then make a paste, but the blocks last longer, plus the manufacturer will have waited until the tamarind is ripe, so it’s sweet and caramelly.” Perfect, then, for Thompson’s barbecue sauce, which involves breaking off 50g pulp, steeping it in water and combining with apple molasses, but the possibilities are (almost) endless: “A block is the most versatile option, but only for someone who gets through a lot.”Perhaps easier is a jar of paste, which is readily available in supermarkets, or tamarind concentrate. “Depending on where it’s from [predominantly Thailand and India], it tastes quite different, which can cause confusion,” says Feast’s ownHelen Goh, whose first solo book,Baking and the Meaning of Life, is out in September. “I only ever use Thai or Malaysian tamarind, which is fruity, bright, smooth, liquidy and brown; Indian tamarind, by contrast, is darker, almost black, and far more concentrated and intense.” Add a spoonful for instant oomph in soups, stews, meat marinades or anywhere you might otherwise turn to citrus. “It’s not quite the same as a block, but it’s still pretty delicious,” Maya says. “Just watch out when seasoning, because the jarred stuff is often already salted.” She suggests adding lime juice to loosen, then flavouring with crushed garlic, chopped spring onion and fresh chilli, plus salt and sugar to taste. “Roast some fish, pour on the tamarind mix and it’s the best. If you’ve got crispy onions, pile them on top as well.” Thompson, meanwhile, would use her noodle: “Make a dressing by watering down tamarind paste, add vinegar, honey, chopped shallot, garlic, lime juice and zest, and pour over a cold noodle salad.”Pineapple and tamarind are synonymous with Malaysia, where Goh grew up, and she says that duo are particularly welcome in an upside-down cake: “Tamarind concentrate goes into the caramel,which is poured into a cake tin. Lay pineapple on top, pour in the cake batter, then bake – it melts into a gooey, syrupy thing that I love.” There’s also tamarind extract, but Thompson would be inclined to leave that well alone: “People tend to come unstuck with that because it is so concentrated.” That said, it works a dream in vegan fish sauce, which is yet more proof that sweet-sour tamarind really does make everything better.Got a culinary dilemma?

Well, another one is already upon us.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Thanks to the climate crisis, we know thatthings are hotting up year on year, and while we can hide in air-conditioned shops and offices, our homes can get uncomfortably – sometimesdangerously– hot. And we also have to go outside – or worse, voluntarily pack ourselves like sweaty sardines on dangerously hot public transport. On those occasions, a portable fan can make all the difference between manageable discomfort and indulging in an inadvisable quantity of ice-cream.Which one should you buy? I’ve spent the past few weeks testing handheld and neck fans from the likes of John Lewis, Dunelm and Bush, assessing them for power, noise, battery life and portability. Here’s what I’ve found.At a glanceBest handheld fan overall:John Lewis handheld and foldable fan£12 at John LewisBest budget handheld fan:Fine Elements folding rechargeable mini travel fan£6 at Wickes (click and collect only)Best for power:Diveblues JetforceFrom £14.44 at AmazonBest neck fan:Jialexin three-speed neck fan£14.71 at eBayWhy you should trust meI’ve been testing consumer technology for more than a decade now, includingelectric toothbrushesandwater flossersfor the Filter. Yet, without wanting to shatter the illusion that this makes me uniquely qualified for the task, portable fans are among the easiest things to test. There’s little subjectivity involved, as you can measure power, noise, weight and battery life. All you really need is a working hypothalamus and fingers that can manoeuvre buttons – which I have.You also need hot weather, of course, but the Great BritishSummerhas been, if anything, a little too accommodating in that regard. It also helps that my PC can turn my tiny office into an overheated sauna in 20 minutes.How I testedView image in fullscreenBlown away: wind speed was tested by active use and with a digital anemometer.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianEach of the 13 fans I tested was assessed for measures that can be objectively tested. Power was not only measured by active use, but via a dedicated digital anemometer to measure wind speed at the highest and lowest supported speeds.More power equals more volume, so I used a sound measurement app held 15cm from the source to assess the decibel level at high, medium and low speeds. I timed how long it took each fan to empty its battery at the lowest and highest speeds (a test my three cats hated even more than I did, due to the constant noise for hours at a time), and popped each one on the scale to get an idea of portability.I also assessed them for more subjective things. Is the fan nice to hold? Can it be folded for increased portability or hands-free use? Does it look visually appealing?Finally, there’s the biggie: price. With portable fans costing between £3 and £100, there’s a huge range of options. It’s simplistic to suggest that a higher cost automatically equals a better experience, though there is naturally a correlation. Nonetheless, I’m more forgiving of odd quirks in cheap fans than I would be in more expensive ones.There’s also the sticky issue of repairability, and thegrowing waste problem of fast tech. Tough-to-replace lithium-ion batteries were present in all but two of the fans tested, which is far from ideal. With that in mind, I kept an eye on build quality too, hoping to endorse fans that will have a long and productive life before they need to be disposed of (electrical recycling, please – you canfind a local spot here).After testing, the fans were either returned to the manufacturer or donated to charity.Here are the six best portable fans from my tests.The best neck and handheld fans in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianBest handheld fan overall:John Lewis handheld and foldable fanView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£12 at John LewisIt may not look that special, but John Lewis’s offering is a well-made product at a reasonable price that doesn’t put a blade wrong. The handle is a good size for a comfortable grip, and the sage colour my review unit came in is rather stylish. You can also get it in white, light blue or an eye-searing orange if you prefer.Why we love itLooks and build quality aside, the fan provides what you need without fuss. It has three power settings, putting out between 2.5 and 3.7 metres a second (m/s) of wind speed, and the 10cm head covers your whole face at a sensible distance without needing constant adjustment. I measured a peak volume of 62.4dB, which isn’t the lowest, but is still quieter than some of the chunkier fans at their lowest levels.The battery lasted more than four hours on its highest setting, which should be sufficient for most journeys, and it can be charged up via a USB-C cable when it’s empty. Pleasingly, the handle can also be folded down to make it a handy desktop fan with or without a cable attached. It works well, as long asyou have space to keep it close enough to be refreshing.It’s a shame that …at 25cm, it’s a little on the tall side.Power levels:3Measuredair speed:2.5-3.7m/sMeasured volume:51.1-62.4dBTested battery life:maximum, 4hrs 11mins; minimum, 9hrs 37minsMeasured weight:181gBeat the heat: 14 expert tips for keeping cool in hot weatherRead moreBestbudget handheld fan:Fine Elements folding rechargeable mini travel fanView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£6 at Wickes (click and collect only)Cheap and cheerful, this folding fan may feel a little rough around the edges, but it gets the job done. It’s not the cheapest fan I tested, but it proved superior toDunelm’s £3 offering(which dropped to a barely noticeable 0.5m/s power as the AA batteries drained) and beatSuperdrug’s £5 fanon battery life (a disappointing 45 minutes at maximum and two hours on minimum).Why we love itIt’s flimsy, but the fan delivers the basics pretty well. It has three speeds, giving between 2.6 and 3.7m/s of wind speed, while the battery lasted six hours at the lowest setting, and just short of three at its highest.It’s a touch noisier than the John Lewis model, maxing out at 64.8dB, but it’s more travel-friendly, folding in half for portability and weighing 48g lighter. That folding hinge means you can also use it as a desk fan, if you like, and there’s even a small flashlight on the bottom for looking around in the dark (though it’s easy to leave this on by mistake).It’s a shame that …the build quality isn’t all that, with some rough plastic moulding.Power levels:3Measuredair speed:2.6-3.7m/sMeasured volume:54.3-64.8dBTested battery life:maximum, 2hrs 50mins; minimum, 6hrsMeasured weight:133gBest for power:Diveblues JetforceView image in fullscreenFrom £14.44 at AmazonIf you want power for a reasonable price, then the Jetforce is the answer. Even at its lowest of five speeds, it narrowly betters the speeds of the two fans above by hitting a breezy 3.8m/s.Why we love itA refreshing breeze even at the lowest settings, but when you’re really struggling with the heat, crank it up all the way to level five, and it hits a massive 6.6m/s.In truth, you likely won’t need to max it out, and that’s just as well because the noise levels really pick up on the higher settings. Starting at an already noisy 66dB, put it all the way up to level five, and it reaches 74.3dB, about the level of a vacuum cleaner – a vacuum cleaner uncomfortably close to your ears. It’ll also hit the battery hard: at level 1, you can eke out nearly 11-and-a-half hours, but that drops to 2hrs 37mins on max.Still, if you can cope with the noise or routinely wear headphones, it’s a nice option to have in really hot weather. Plus, the flexible head means you can use it as a desk fan, and it has an attachable lanyard so it can be worn around the neck, blasting air upwards.It’s a shame that …it gets noisy fast.Power levels:5Measuredair speed:3.8-6.6m/sMeasured volume:66-74.3dBTested battery life:maximum, 2hrs 37mins; minimum, 11hrs 25minsMeasured weight:184gskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

A fan worn around the neck does that, whiletargeting the body’s thermoregulation centre, which can, in theory, make you feel cooler.The Jialexin three-speed neck fan certainly delivered that, if you can cope with fans running so close to your ears.Why we love itIt really does make you feel cooler, even if the fans don’t appear to be more powerful when compared with regular handheld fans. My anemometer test revealed seemingly low speeds of 1.7 to 2.2m/s, but there are more air sources and, as a result, the cooling effect felt more consistent and less disruptive than a jet of constant air to the face.The downside of this, however, is the noise. While the measured volume of 52 to 64.1dB doesn’t sound too bad – around the sound of a busy office – having it this close to your ears for an extended period is tiring, and you do feel a sense of calm when it’s switched off again. That said, if you’re wearing headphones, it becomes a non-issue.This neck fan is extremely comfortable to wear, and it’s more flexible than solid plastic ones, so you can shape it around your neck for more comfortable cooling. That, for me, makes it stand out from its competitors.It’s a shame that …by design, neck fans have to be quite close to your ears.Power levels:3Measuredair speed:1.7-2.2m/sMeasured volume range:52-64.1dBTested battery life:maximum, 3hrs 19mins; minimum, 8hrsMeasured weight:291gThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianJisuLife Ultra2 handheld fanView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianBest for:a multi-function fan$94.49 (about £70.33) at JisuLife£87.99 at AmazonIf you’ve got money to burn, then the JisuLife handheld fan Ultra2 is both ridiculously powerful and extremely versatile.Starting with the power, it has 100 different speeds, ranging from 2.8m/s all the way up to 9.8m/s at full blast, with 98 increments in between. The battery is impressive too, lasting well over a day at the lowest speed – though this did drop to 1hr 34mins when running at full blast.I was secretly quite pleased about that, as the 88.8dB volume (similar to a hairdryer) wasn’t a particularly fun time for my ears, even from a decent distance away. In truth, that kind of power is uncomfortably like staring down a wind tunnel anyway, and the lower settings are considerably easier on the ears: 59.5dB at level 1, rising to 79.1dB at 50.The high price of entry is made a little easier to swallow, though, since the Ultra 2 brings a few extra features for the money. There are a couple of adapters in the box to turn the fan into an air cushion inflater pump or to help kickstart campfires by pushing in more air. A powerful torch on the back can flick between different lighting modes, including a flashing one to attract attention in an emergency.For those of us allergic to camping, there are more sedate indoor uses. One of the adapters is a dust cleaner, which has removed an unspeakable amount of gunk from my keyboard, and the USB-C charging port is two way, meaning you can steal some of the 9,000mAh battery for your other devices too.It didn’t make the final cut because …you could buy 15 Fine Elements fans for the Jisulife’s RRP of £95.Power levels:100;measuredair speed:2.8-9.8m/s;measured volume:59.5-88.8dB;tested battery life:maximum, 1hr 34mins; minimum, 26hrs 49mins;measured weight:294gVonHaus handheld fan & phone holderView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianBest for:peace and quiet£10.99 at VonHaus£10.99 at AmazonTake it from someone who’s listened to the incessant hum of fans for weeks now: the noise can become grating. If keeping sound to a minimum is your priority, then this VonHaus 3-in-1 fan might be the one for you. At its lowest setting, it registered just 41dB – less than the sound of a fridge humming.At that volume, you’re looking at a limited power of 2.7m/s, of course, but you can increase that to 4.3m/s over five incrementally louder settings if you need something more. It’s worth noting that by the time you hit maximum, the volume reaches 61.9dB – more comparable with the other fans on test.Overall, it’s a well-designed fan: comfortable in the hand, with a stand to put it upright on your desk, including a phone holder at the base if you want to watch something over the fan’s whisper. You can even use it as a makeshift neck fan with the detachable lanyard, and the head pointed upwards. This isn’t a direct substitute for a neck fan, as it’s still aimed at the face, but it’s a nice added use case all the same.It didn’t make the final cut because …the smaller head doesn’t cover quite as much of the face as other models.Power levels:5;measuredair speed:2.7-4.3m/s;measured volume:41-61.9dB;tested battery life:maximum, 3hrs 45mins; minimum, 13hrs 20mins;measured weight:129gWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenHigher fan speeds might make you feel cooler, but they can be louder and drain the battery more quickly.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianWhat features should I look for in a fan?Look out for fans with different uses. While the traditional way to use a handheld fan is, of course, in the hand, some models can double as desktop fans, either by folding in half or with a bundled stand. Some even come with a lanyard attachment so they can be worn hands-free around the neck.While power might seem like the key feature, remember this is always a trade-off. Higher fan speeds will make you feel nominally cooler, but will come at the expense of battery life and more subtle noise levels.What are the advantages of a neck fan?Neck fans have two advantages over regular handheld fans. The first is that they’re entirely hands-free, meaning you can wear them without temporarily losing the use of a hand in the process.The second advantage is that as they target the neck, there’sevidence to suggestthey may make you feel cooler overall. This is because the thermoregulation centre is at the base of the brain, so a neck fan may make you feel cooler than a regular handheld one, even if your actual body temperature isn’t dropping all that much.The downside to this is that the positioning directly below your ears can be a little tiring, given the constant volume (although this is a problem that’s easily sidestepped with a pair of headphones).Alan Martin is awriter who has been putting products – including phones, gaming devices and wearables – through their paces for more than a decade.

I love the simplicity and elegance of this recipe: it is the perfect balance of sweet and sour, spicy and salty, and it feels special at the same time. Griddle and marinate the peaches ahead of time, if you like, and feel free to switch them for nectarines, apricots or whatever you have to hand that looks good for griddling.Grilled peach, gorgonzola and thyme tartinesPrep5 minCook20 minServes22 peaches(about 200g)Olive oilSea salt andblack pepperA few sprigsfresh thyme1 tbsp honey1 pinch red chilli flakes1 small ciabatta, or half a large one1 garlic clove, peeled and cut in half150g gorgonzolaA handful of rocket leavesPut a griddle pan on a high heat. Halve the peaches, remove the stones and cut the fruit into wedges. Put the wedges in a small bowl, drizzle with a tablespoon of olive oil and season generously. Add the leaves from the thyme sprigs, toss to coat, then griddle the peach slices for a minute or two on each side, until they take on dark char lines and soften slightly. Return them to the bowl, add the honey and chilli flakes, toss again and set aside.Heat the grill to high. Cut the ciabatta in half horizontally and toast under the hot grill for a couple of minutes, until golden and very lightly toasted. Drizzle each slice with olive oil and rub with the cut side of the halved garlic clove.Cut the gorgonzola into ½cm-thick slices and lay these over one side of the ciabatta halves.

That’s where she made the wine,”says Pepa Fernández proudly, pointing towards a weathered building no bigger than a garden shed. We’re standing between two fields on a chalky road skirted by poppies, daisies and thistles. One field is lined with neat rows of lush vines, the other with small bush vines soon to bear monastrell grapes (the most dominant variety in these parts). In the distance, a sandy-coloured mountain range peppered with pine trees sits beneath a cloudless blue sky.Pocket-sized Pepa is the face ofBodega Balcona, a family-run organic winery in Spain’s south-eastern province of Murcia. The vineyard lies in the picturesque Aceniche valley, in Bullas – one of Murcia’s three wine DOPs (denominaciónes deorigen protegida), alongside Yecla and Jumilla. Each has its own wine route, scattered with museums and vineyards.My girlfriend and I are in the area to explore Murcia’s food and drink scene after a tipoff from an old friend who grew up in the city (Murcia is the name of both the province and its capital). The province hosted two of Spain’s most prestigious culinary events last year: theRepsol Guide Soles galaand the Michelin Guide gala.View image in fullscreenSalto del Usero in Bullas is a lovely spot for a cooling dip.Photograph: Antonio Lopez/Alamy“Murcia is one of the best food cities in Spain,”a suave Granada-based gentleman in a fedora tells me on the way to the tasting room. We soon learn that its wine is pretty special, too, as we make our way through Bodega Balcona’s roster of earthy natural wines. Each glass is paired with national and regional dishes: cold cuts, local cheeses, almonds, tuna empanadas, and a Murcian favourite made by Pepa’s nephew,pastel de carne– a hearty meat and egg pie topped with flaky pastry.After, we drive to the nearby Salto del Usero waterfall, where kids are paddling and teenagers are sunning themselves on rocks, like lizards. Following a quick dip in the chilly plunge pool, we go to meet Paco Franciso Muñoz Reales, who runs an organic farm nearby with his German wife, Heidi.Murcia's agricultural heritage stems from a vast network of fertile gardens that surround the city, where baroque buildings and buzzing tapas bars clusterLaid-back and softly spoken, Paco is part of a localcooperative of growers, including Pepa, using ecological farming methods. He explains there was a little bit of tension with local farmers when he first started, but things have settled down. On a tour of his five-hectare estate, he shows me a seed bank tucked inside a pantry, rows of apricot, olive and lemon trees, and a tomato patch.View image in fullscreenOutside Murcia Cathedral with apastel de carne, a meat and egg pie that’s a specialty of the region.Photograph: Panther Media Global/AlamyNicknamed the garden of Europe, Murcia accounts for around20% of Spain’s fruit and vegetable exports. This agricultural heritage stems from a vast network of fertile gardens, orhuertos, that surround the city of Murcia, where baroque buildings, palm-lined riverbanks and buzzing tapas bars cluster around Plaza de las Flores. La Huerta de Murcia, as the fertile area is called, also influences local food culture, with Sundays traditionally reserved for family meals at rustic restaurants.Each spring, the city also throws theBando de la Huertafestival – a lively celebration of rural life where locals don traditional dress and feast on regional dishes. We arrive a few weeks later, so instead visit the rustic El Cañal Los Almillas restaurant, where we tuck intoheaped platters of beef entrecote dusted with a layer of rock salt, and a fresh tomato salad with olives and lettuce, accompanied by plates of lemon (Murcianos squeeze lemon on everything). We finish with a classic Murcian dessert of crispy, deep-friedpaparajotes– battered lemon leaves served with a dollop of ice-cream.Samuel Ruiz, the young, tattooed chef, could be Spain’s Anthony Bourdain. He trained at the famed El BulliThe restaurant is named after the city’s canal system, which are part of an irrigation system dating back to Moorish times.“Think of it as the Segura River being the heart and the canals the veins that deliver the blood,”our guide, Antonio, explains.David López, the chef at the fine-dining restaurantLocal de Ensayo, tells us these ancient systems are still in use today as he shows us around hishuerto. López visits his patch daily, growing everything from lettuce, beans and cucumber to strawberries and aubergines. Fruit and vegetables feature prominently in traditional Murcian cooking, in dishes such asensalada murciana(tomato salad with tuna, olives and egg) andarroz con verduras(rice with vegetables).“It’s a way of life for me, somewhere I can bring the children to plant things and watch them grow,”López says while trudging through the mud, checking his crops. About 20% of the produce used in his restaurant comes from his garden, the rest being supplied by an ecological farmer with a stall atVerónicas market, which sells fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and olive oil to the city.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We finish atCafé Bar Verónicas, which to the untrained eye looks like any other neighbourhood bar: metal countertops, shelves of pickled vegetables and wine, and locals chatting loudly. However, framed newspaper reviews hint at something more.It’s run by Samuel Ruiz and his wife, Isabel Torrecillas. The young, tattooed chef could be Spain’s Anthony Bourdain. Ruiz, who trained at the famed El Bulli, was responsible for one of Murcia’s most exciting restaurants, Kome, a tiny Japanese-style tavern.“They didn’t have social media. No website. Nothing. But people still queued down the street,”Torrecillas tells us. Ruiz decided to shut down Kome and return to his roots, opening abarrawith a twist in the heart of town, she explains as a plate ofcaballito(little horse in Spanish) lands on the table. The popular local dish usually features deep-fried prawns, only here it’s made with fist-sized crayfish, shell and all. It’s followed by a good-sized bowl ofmarinera, a kind of Russian salad with anchovies, served with crisp bread and homemade mayo.We’re treated to an elevated take on Murcian cuisine, including pani puri balls exploding with tuna tartareWhen I ask Ruiz what sauce he’s plating up, he squirts a dot on to the back of my hand.“Try it,”he grins confidently. It is a delicious homemade saffron mayonnaise with anchovy, lemon and garlic.A frozen cocktail with an umbrella appears moments later, sent from his other bar next door,Colmado San Julián.We finish up and say our goodbyes before wandering over to López’s restaurant. As we enter, he vanishes without a word and we’re seated by a window peering into the kitchen. Dishes soon arrive at the table from his excellent tasting menu (from about £65), which champions local, seasonal ingredients. Standout plates include a wild mushroom dish packed with umami, a deep-flavoured red Calasparra rice with vegetables, and his excellent signature dessert, a cross between a flan and a crème brûlée (a favourite of the legendary Spanish food critic José Carlos Capel).View image in fullscreenFlowers are also handed out at the Bando de la Huerta parade.Photograph: Europa Press News/Europa Press/Getty ImagesThe next day we drive 45 minutes out of town toCasa Borrego– a cosy eight-room gastronomic hotel with soft bucolic rooms and a burbling beck outside. For dinner, we’re treated to an elevated take on Murcian cuisine, includingpani puriballs exploding with tuna tartare, and a massive pan of rich rabbit rice. Retiring to bed, we’re lulled to sleep by the sound of trickling water. With our time in Murcia nearly up, the following day we zip back to the city to hunt down one last dish:zarangollo, a simple courgette-and-egg scramble. We find it at a traditional tapas bar calledBodegón Los Toneles– alljamónlegs and chalkboard menus.We end the trip as we began with a local tipple, this time atCaféLab.Asiáticois a heady blend of condensed milk, Licor 43, cognac and spices – said to hail from Cartagena.

Here’s how to revive itGynelle LeonTue 12 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTShareWhat’s the problem?My Swiss cheese plant (Monstera deliciosa) has survived for years, but recently the leaves have become dull and lost their gloss.DiagnosisSwiss cheese plants are renowned for their lush, naturally glossy leaves. However, they can lose their sheen because of dust accumulation, unsuitable potting conditions, or stress, often linked to watering habits or inadequate nutrients.PrescriptionRepot your plant into well-draining compost enriched with organic matter and perlite or bark chips. Regularly wipe the leaves gently with a damp cloth. Ensure consistent watering, only when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. And ensure the plant is exposed to bright, indirect light to support healthy growth.PreventionGently dust the leaves every few weeks, and keep your plant well fed with occasional doses of diluted liquid fertiliser during the growing season. With suitable soil, proper watering, good airflow and careful cleaning, your Swiss cheese plant should regain its natural, healthy glossiness.Got a plant dilemma?

Last June, a warning written in big, capital letters was stuck to the window of one flat. “DO NOT BUY THESE FLATS. TOO HOT,” it read.It was hard to miss for those walking past the looming high-rises and, after being snapped and posted on social media, the placard hasgarneredmore than 500,000 views. More than a year on, during a summer when the UK recorded its second-warmest June and fifth-hottestJulysince 1884, residents in the tallest, south-facing block say heat is still an issue.“When I’m trying to fall asleep at night, it gets quite unbearable,” said Lucian Ho, 21, a student who lives near the top of a 28-storey building in the development. Options to cool off in his south-facing flat are limited. “All I can do is open the window,” he said.The development is situated in Tower Hamlets, which is the most densely populated borough in the UK. Eighty-one per cent of households live in purpose-built flats, the second-highest proportion in England and Wales and double the London-wide rate. The borough has also seen a massive sky-rise boom, with 71 buildings with 20 or more floors being built between 2014 and 2024. To top it off, it ranks poorly for green space. All these factors come together to make living in the borough a hot box for many.Experts have warned that many of the new homes being built in the UK are not designed to withstand the moreextreme summer temperaturesbeing seen due to climate change. They have called for the government to update its upcoming future homes standard to include provisions for overheating homes.View image in fullscreen‘It gets quite unbearable’:  Lucian Ho on his balcony in Leaside Lock. He says all he can do is open the window for air.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThe regulations are due to be published this autumn and to come into force from 2027, but the focus has been mainly onhow to keep homes warm in winter, rather than to keep them cool in summer.Up the road from Leaside Lock sits another development, Three Waters. “It feels like you’re in a trap,” said Sandra Monteiro, who lives on the 11th floor in one of the complex’s blocks.The 41-year-old SEND teacher has lived in the flat with her husband for almost three years but the sweltering heat means she’s considering leaving. “Our temperatures haven’t gone below 27C inside the house in the past two months,” she said. Her thermometer peaked at 33C this summer.This is my flat. Leaside Lock development in Bromley-by-Bow. They already discovered 2 sections of my MVHR weren't fitted correctly. It's still like living in an oven even though this has been 'fixed'! @GuinnessHomes#leasidelockpic.twitter.com/dAH6GidB0f— Aidan Sheehan (@aidan_sheehan)June 22, 2024When temperatures inside rise above 25C, risks to health rise too, potentially causing or worsening cardiovascular and respiratory issues, sleep disturbance, mental health problems and heat exhaustion.Monteiro said the heat in her flat causes frequent headaches. “Exhaustion, feeling like we’re out of breath. We have experienced feeling very fatigued, even when we wake up,” she said. “When we travel abroad we don’t experience as much exhaustion as we do here in the UK, which is definitely to do with the heat.”View image in fullscreenProximity to the busy A12 dual carriageway means residents suffer from dirt and noise if they open their windows.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThe UK Green Building Council has said street trees are a simple and cost effective way to keep homes cool. But Monteiro’s block is situated beside the busy A12 and the streets below are barren of any green space. “If we have the windows open because of the motorway, we get a lot of the dust and the heat that comes from that,” she said.She bought a 25% share of the home with her husband for £121,000. On top of this, she pays £1,264 per month in rent. “It is my first summer really experiencing these high temperatures and I’m feeling quite unsure about whether I want to continue living here,” she said.A spokesperson for Peabody, which runs Three Waters, said: “We want residents to feel comfortable in their homes all year round and work with construction partners to ensure homes are designed with ventilation and shading in mind, considering the risk of overheating.”They said that since new regulations to reduce the risk of new-builds overheating were introduced in 2022, they had added features to new homes like external shutters that let in daylight but block out heat. “We’re also looking at materials that help keep homes cooler during summer and warmer in winter,” it said.Guiness Homes, which runs Leaside Lock, said that of the 440 properties in their blocks they had only received complaints from four homeowners about heat inside their homes, all of whom were given adaptations to reduce temperatures. “The image you have shared relates to a homeowner who had a specific and unique issue in their property which has been addressed,” they said.deaths chartFarther north in the city sits Kestrel House. The looming 55 metre-tall council block became a symbol of inner-city life after being featured on the cover of The Streets’ debut album Original Pirate Material. It lies along a busy thoroughfare in Islington, which – after Tower Hamlets – has the second highest population density in the UK. It also suffers from a lack of green space, and residents have access to an average of 2m2of green space per capita, the lowest amount of any borough in the UK, according the Friends of the Earth.Chris Brown, 76, has lived at the top of Kestrel House since 1987. In his 38 years living there as a council tenant, he has found heat an increasing problem. In the summer, temperatures inside his 17th floor flat rarely go below 27C. This year, they reached a high of 30C and in previous heatwaves his thermometer has hit a peak of 35C.The semi-retired psychotherapist fitted an air conditioning unit in his living room due to fears about what the heat could be doing to his health. “I spent as much time as I can in here, in front of the blast of cold air from the air conditioning unit,” he said.Brown has a heart condition, diabetes and chronic fatigue syndrome. “It does cause people to die, so I became worried,” he said.Hot homes aren’t just uncomfortable – they can be deadly. During the heatwaves in 2024, UKHealthSecurity Agency figures estimated that about 358 people died at home, in part due to extreme temperatures.View image in fullscreenChris Brown said temperatures in his flat in Kestrel House have reached a high of 30C this summer. In previous heatwaves they hit a peak of 35C.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianDeaths tend to spike because theheat exacerbates existing medical conditions, rather than directly causing otherwise healthy people to die – overall influenza and pneumonia deaths were 13% higher than they otherwise would have been during the 2024 heatwaves, and circulatory disease deaths, dementia and Alzheimer’s deaths were up 11%.The heat affects Brown’s current health conditions. “Heat stress makes my fatigue worse so life is just a little bit more of a struggle,” he said. “Sleeping became difficult. It tires me out. I was continually feeling more tired than usual.”Tall buildings, especially those surrounded by other looming towers, are susceptible to the urban heat island effect – where materials like concrete and asphalt absorb and retain heat. Brown said the heat sticks around, even when temperatures outside reduce. “It doesn’t cool down. It’s like a brick oven,” he said.Councillor Rowena Champion, executive member for environment, air quality and transport for Islington council said: “We are aware that many people in Islington live in flats built in a different era that weren’t designed for extreme heat. This has a real impact especially for older people, those with health conditions, or families with babies. Tackling overheating in homes must be a shared priority for councils, developers and government. In the meantime, we are looking at practical solutions like reflective coatings and green infrastructure to help reduce overheating in tall buildings.”Additional reporting by Saranka Maheswaran and Andy DengThis article was amended on 12 August 2025. Text was added to clarify that it is residents of the tallest, south-facing block at Leaside Lock that have reported ongoing heat issues.Explore more on these topicsExtreme heatHousingHealthClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She was sent to live with her father, but he worked away from home a lot. His new wife resented his other children and was emotionally abusive.Macyleen lived with three half-siblings, but they were much older. “We were there to survive and just get to the next day. I knew I was alone,” she recalls.That feeling has never really left Macyleen, who is now 33, building a childminding business and bringing up four children on her own in Gqeberha (formerly Port Elizabeth), SouthAfrica.There are many people in Africa experiencing loneliness, like Macyleen. According to areport in June by the World Health Organization, Africa is the loneliest continent on Earth.Almost a quarter (24%) of people there reported feeling lonely, and adolescents aged 13 to 17 are the worst affected, the WHO says. The next highest rates of loneliness are in the eastern Mediterranean (21%), followed by south-east Asia (18%). Europe has the lowest rate, at about 10%.We have been globalising ourselves … we rejected the notion that there’s loneliness and isolation in the continentDr Cleopa MailuThe report comes after the WHO declared loneliness a pressing“global public health concern”and launched an internationalcommission on social connectionto examine the problem.Africa is traditionally viewed as having a collectivist culture that prioritises the needs and goals of the group as a whole over individuals. But this is changing.Dr Cleopa Mailu, a member of the commission and a former Kenyan health minister, says: “My initial reaction [to the findings] was one of rejection.“I live in Africa and tend to think the society we are today is the one of the 1950s or 60s, and that there’s more loneliness in the western hemisphere. I came to realise that feeling I had was just an internalisation of our past.”Loneliness is not recognised as a problem in Africa, says Mailu, and people do not want to discuss it. Instead, social wellbeing has been neglected in health policies in favour of focusing on communicable and non-communicable diseases.Meanwhile, cities on the continent are rapidly expanding; over the next three decades,Africa’s urban population will double, increasing from 700 million to 1.4 billion by 2050.View image in fullscreenA mother carries her daughter through a market in Anambra, Nigeria. Factors such as changes in society and the cost of living are exacerbating isolation.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/AP“We never came alive to the fact that we have been globalising ourselves – living in conditions which are not traditional to the African people,” adds Mailu. “In a way, we rejected the notion that there’s loneliness and isolation in the continent.”Mailu attributes higher levels of loneliness to a changing society, and growing urbanisation and globalisation, as well as new governance structures, migration, poverty and changing views of wealth and success.“In traditional settings, wealth was defined differently,” says Mailu. “You just needed to have a cow and a farm or somewhere to cultivate. Everybody was the same level.“Now there are different levels of poverty,” he says. “There is a lot of pressure and you find people are not together.”Macyleen can identify with this. She says the Africa she grew up in is very different from the one she lives in today.People are copying western culture, she says: “It’s all about me or my immediate people. Maybe that’s one of the reasons people are becoming more selfish.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re going to have a lot of problems beyond mental healthLateefat Odunuga, psychologistMacyleen finds it hard to open up to people, fearing judgment over being a single mother to children with different fathers, all of whom abandoned her. She also has little opportunity to socialise, given that she is trying to build her own business and bring up four children with no financial help.“I struggle with stress and things are getting hard in South Africa. There’s a lot of xenophobia and I have this heavy feeling that I don’t belong here any more,” she says.“If something happens, I have to be the mother and the father [to my children]. It gets really lonely, especially because I’m scared of dating. Who can I find to trust?“The world is changing so fast,” she adds. “And there’s too much pressure to do well, but we are in an environment that is not helping us.”Lateefat Odunuga, a psychologist and global adviser for the African Network of Youth Policy Experts, agrees that Africa is changing from a continent with many people in close-knit communities to one where that traditional way of life is being erased by urbanisation.She says loneliness is a pressing issue for young people across the continent. “Young people are frustrated,” she says. “There’s a lot of unemployment, drug abuse, mental health issues. We’re seeing a lot of young people dying [by] suicide.”View image in fullscreenA Zimbabwean community health worker with the Friendship Bench Project welcomes a potential client in a suburb of Harare.Photograph: Cynthia R MatonhodzeThe increased cost of living, she adds, means people would rather stay at home than spend money on cultural events, for example.She blames technology for contributing to the problem. More people are using apps such as TikTok for entertainment and, through her practice in Nigeria, she has heard of individuals turning to ChatGPT to check if they are depressed, instead of talking to a family member, for example.Harare’s park bench grandmas: ‘I speak to them and feel a load is lifted off my heart’Read moreWhile loneliness might not be recognised on a widespread basis in Africa, there are organisations dedicated to tackling it, she says. She citesFriendship Bench, an approach first developed in Zimbabwethat trains community health workers to provide basic cognitive behavioural therapy with an emphasis on activity scheduling and group support. The model has been replicated in countries throughout the world.The WHO report highlighted theAgeWell peer-to-peer support programmein Cape Town. Older volunteers were trained to provide friendship and company to less able older residents in their community through regular home visits. South African participants reported less loneliness, and there was a significant increase in social participation.“Depending on how committed we are to this work,” says Odunuga, “there might be a future for us to tackle social isolation and loneliness.“But if we don’t bring people together,” she warns, “we are doomed. We’re going to have a lot of problems beyond mental health. It will be a disaster and a total shame to humanity.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailingjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Seven children reached the shore, where they were handed over to the regional authorities.“About 100 people tried to get in, taking advantage of the foggy conditions, which make it hard to spot people,” said a spokesperson for the Spanish central government’s delegation in Ceuta. “But they didn’t manage to do so because the Moroccan security forces and [Spain’s] Guardia Civil, working together with rescue boats, prevented them from getting to Ceuta.”However, he confirmed the arrival of the seven children.Map of north Africa and the Iberian peninsula, showing the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in north AfricaUsually people need to swim out from the Moroccan coast, into the treacherous currents of the strait of Gibraltar, to make their way to and around the long border fences that jut out into the sea, cordoning off the Ceuta enclave from Moroccan territory.The swimming migrants can be easy to pick up when there are just a few – so people try to go in large numbers in fog or at night-time. Those who are intercepted are returned toMorocco.Last month, Juan Jesús Rivas, the conservative president of the autonomous city, said Ceuta was “totally overwhelmed” by the number of young migrants it was hosting, and called for other Spanish regions to take in some of the children.“We’re a territory that comprises 20 square kilometres of the 500,000 square kilometres that make up the whole of Spain, but we take in 3% of the minors,”Rivas told El País.“Who doesn’t get that this is an unsustainable situation? The situation in Ceuta is one of collapse and that poses a very serious risk when it comes to looking after minors and to the city as a whole.”‘Barcelona or death’: mothers watch and wait as Senegal’s men risk all to reach EuropeRead moreAt the end of July, Alberto Gaitán, the Ceuta government’s spokesman, said the enclave was hosting 528 foreign minors when it wasofficially able to hold only 27. Gaitán pointed out that contingency plans were already in place to send the children to other Spanish regions.“Between 2021 and 2024, around 450 minors – to whom we should add another 80 because of family regrouping in different parts of Spain – were relocated to other self-governing regions,” he said. “That shows that other regions, whatever their political hue, are there to help and have shown they can help relieve Ceuta.”Four months ago, Spanish MPs approved a decreeto redistribute the 4,400 foreign minorsin the Canary islands, Ceuta and Spain’s othernorth African enclave of Melilla, across other regions.The decree, put forward by the socialist-led government and its parliamentary allies, was criticised by the conservative People’s Party (PP), as “arbitrary and unfair”. The far-right Vox party also voted against it, saying it opened “the doors to military-age men who aren’t fleeing any wars and who come from opposing cultures”.In July,PP-led regions boycotted a meetingon the redistribution of the children. .According to the UN’s International Organization for Migration,572 people died or went missing last yeartrying to reach Spain from north Africa, while 155 people have lost their lives so far this year, seven of them children.A 23-year-old Egyptian man was pulled from the Mediterranean a few weeks ago aftertrying to reach Spain from Morocco using an inflatable ringand flippers.

The tragedy drew international attention and highlighted pervasive abuse in the government’s shelter system.The six sentenced on Tuesday – two former police officers and four former child protection officials – were found guilty of homicide, mistreatment of minors, breach of duties and abuse of authority. All pleaded not guilty.Judge Ingrid Cifuentes also ordered the investigation of former president Jimmy Morales for his role in ordering police to work at a facility where minors who had not committed crimes were held.‘Screaming in terror’: teen survivor relives ordeal of Guatemala children’s shelter fireRead moreFormer social welfare secretary Carlos Rodas was sentenced to 25 years in prison.Earlier, Rodas told those gathered in the courtroom, including relatives of the victims, that he had not caused “any harm to their daughters and the survivors”.Also among those convicted was ex-police officer Lucinda Marroquín, who held the key to the room where the girls were locked up and didn’t open it when the fire started. She was sentenced to 13 years in prison.The judge said that through phone records, investigators were able to establish that at the time of the fire Marroquín was talking on her phone. The judge said a witness had testified that when told about the fire, Marroquín responded with profanity and said “let them burn.”A former government prosecutor assigned to the protection of children was acquitted.The fire occurred on 8 March 2017, at the Virgin de la Asunción Safe Home outside Guatemala City, when 56 girls and teenagers were padlocked in a classroom allegedly for bad behavior.About 700 children – nobody knew exactly how many – lived in a home with a maximum capacity for 500. The majority had committed no crime. They were sent there by the courts for various reasons: they had run away, they were abused, they were migrants.The night before the fire, a group of girls had escaped. Hours later, the police returned them to the home. They were locked in a room that had no access to a bathroom and guarded by police. They were given foam mattresses to sleep on.After hours of demanding to be let out, one girl lit the fire.After spending hours locked inside, one of the girls lit a match to a mattress, thinking it might force police to let them out. Smoke and flames quickly filled the room, but despite cries for help, police refused to open the doors for nine minutes, witnesses said.Forty-one girls and teenagers died, and 15 more survived with serious burns.Cifuentes said that the fire was the culmination of a series of abuses, some of which had been reported to authorities but not acted on. She said autopsies confirmed the presence of drugs in some of the girls that supported their complaints that they were given sleeping pills that were among the reasons they had tried to escape the facility.Explore more on these topicsGuatemalaYoung peopleAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Beijing responded the following morning that it would suspend additional tariffs on US goods for a further 90 days.Trump had previously threatened to put tariff rates as high as 245% on Chinese imports into the US after the deadline passed, while Beijing had threatened retaliatory tariffs of 125%.In response to the reprieve, markets in Japan and Australia hit record highs on Tuesday, as expectations grew that Washington and Beijing could secure a trade agreement during the fresh hiatus, which extends current baseline rates of 30% on Chinese goods into the US and 10% on American products going the other way.Tokyo’s Nikkei share index rose 2.5% to 42,867.69 points on Tuesday, while the Australian ASX 200 index closed up 0.41%, to a new high of 8,880. Its momentum was helped by the Reserve Bank of Australiacutting its main interest rate to a two-year low of 3.6%.In China, the Shanghai composite index rose by 0.5%.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9% in early trading and was on track to top its all-time high set two weeks ago, while the Dow was up 1% and the tech-focused Nasdaq climbed 1.1% and was also heading toward a record.Economists have warned that Trump’s trade war regime, especially against China,could seriously damage the global economic outlook, as it could lead to higher costs, disrupt supply chains and reduce international trade.Mark Haefele, of the Swiss bank UBS, said the trade truce represented “an encouraging step toward finding an agreement between Washington and Beijing that would avoid a significant disruption in global trade flows”.“We think the additional time could yield concessions from both sides on several unresolved issues, including fentanyl flows, rare-earth controls, tech export curbs, and Russian oil purchase,” he said.Oil prices also rose on Tuesday amid hopes the trade war could de-escalate.

She denies the charges.Yoon Suk Yeolwas sent backinto detention in July as prosecutors investigate his failed attempt to impose martial law in December last year.A special counsel was established after Lee Jae Myungwas elected presidentin June to investigate16 criminal allegationsagainst Kim. However, Wednesday’s arrest warrant covered only three charges.View image in fullscreenFormer South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol arriving at Seoul central district court in July.Photograph: Yonhap/EPAProsecutors allegeshe madeover 800 million won (£428,000) through manipulating the stock prices of Deutsch Motors, a local BMW dealership, between 2009 and 2012, by conspiring with others to artificially inflate shares.She is also accusedof receivingover 270 million won worth of illegal political funding through free opinion polling services, andusing thisto influence candidate selections for the conservative People Power party in the country’s 2022 byelections.The third charge involves accepting luxury gifts including Chanelhandbagsandexpensive jewelleryfrom the Unification Church through a shaman intermediary, in exchange for favourable treatment of development projects in Cambodia.Kim was questioned forover seven hoursby investigators last week before the arrest warrant was sought.On issuing the warrant, judge Jeong Jae-wook cited “concerns about evidence destruction” as the primary reason for detention,according to Yonhap News. Kim had spent four and a half hours in court, where she denied all charges against her.During the hearing, Kim reportedlyexpressed frustrationabout her personal affairs being scrutinised, telling the judge she was “upset that even issues from before my marriage keep being brought up”.She will be held at Nambu detention centre in south-western Seoul, separate from her husband, who has been in custody at Seoul detention centre since July.Once considered to wield enormous influence behind the scenes during her husband’s presidency, the former arts exhibition company executive was embroiled in a series of issues throughout his term, including the infamousDior bag scandal, which prosecutors are now also reinvestigating.In recent weeks, hermaster’sanddoctoraldegrees were both revoked over thesis plagiarism.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But we are hoping that these personnel are in good condition,” he told reporters.Tarriela said the Chinese crew did not respond to the Philippine ship’s offer of assistance.Gan Yu, a Chinese coastguard spokesperson, confirmed that a confrontation had taken place, without mentioning the collision. “TheChinacoastguard took necessary measures in accordance with the law, including monitoring, pressing from the outside, blocking and controlling the Philippine vessels to drive them away,” he said in a statement.China has neither confirmed or denied the incident, only saying that it “lawfully” took measures to drive away Philippine vessels that had “forcibly intruded” into its waters.“The China coastguard will continue to carry out rights-protection law enforcement activities in the waters of Huangyan Dao in accordance with the law, and will resolutely safeguard China’s national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,” said the coastguard spokesperson Gan Yu, using China’s name for the shoal.Monday’s incident is thelatest in a series of confrontationsbetween China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost entirely despite an international ruling that the assertion has no legal basis.More than 60% of global maritime trade passes through the disputed waterway.South China Sea: a visual guide to the key shoals, reefs and islandsRead moreSpeaking at a news conference, the Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, said the country’s patrol vessels would “continue to be present” in the area to defend, as well as exercise Manila’s sovereign rights over, what it considers to be part of its territory.The Scarborough Shoal – a triangular chain of reefs and rocks – has been a flashpoint between the countries since China seized it from thePhilippinesin 2012.Marcos has also warned that the Philippines risks confrontation with China over another issue – Taiwan, which China’s rulers are preparing to annex as territory. With US backing of Taiwan, any attempt threatens to spiral into a broader conflict, and on a recent trip to India, Marcos said “there is no way that the Philippines can stay out of it”.The Philippines lies on the other side of a crucial sea passage past Taiwan – the Bashi channel – and there are more than 100,000 Philippine nationals living in Taiwan who would need to be evacuated in the event of a conflict.On Monday, Beijing accused Marcos of “playing with fire” with his comments, drawing a rebuke from the president that they had misinterpreted his comments “for propaganda purposes”.“War over Taiwan will drag the Philippines kicking and screaming into the conflict. That is what I was trying to say,” Marcos said.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsSouth China SeaChinaPhilippinesAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Infections across the region are at the highest level since 2016, theWHOsaid. Fiji, Samoa and Tonga are among the worst affected.How rising seas are threatening the crucial art of weaving in SamoaRead moreDr Paula Vivili, deputy director general of the Pacific Community (SPC), said historicallydengue outbreakswere seasonal.“However, due to climate change, transmission seasons are lengthening, and some areas are experiencing year-round dengue risk,” Vivili said.Dengue fever, a viral illness spread by Aedes mosquitoes, causes high fever, severe headache, joint and muscle pain, rash, and in severe cases can be fatal. Rising temperatures, rainfall and increased humidity are creating ideal breeding conditions for Aedes mosquitoes, even in areas previously unsuitable for transmission.“Dengue is one of the first real disease-related phenomena that we can lay at the foot of climate change,” said Dr Joel Kaufman, epidemiologist and director of the Center for Exposures, Diseases, Genomics and Environment at the University of Washington.“Rainfall raises the waterline over mosquito eggs laid just above the surface, which then hatch – that’s part of the natural breeding cycle. Heavy rains can also increase stagnant water sources, creating more opportunities for mosquitoes to breed,” he said.Kaufman warned these outbreaks pointed to awider public health challenge.“It is in the vanguard of what will certainly be many types of human disease that become more common and more serious as the planet warms.”Since declaring an outbreak in April,Samoa has confirmed six dengue-related deaths, including two siblings, and more than 5,600 cases. This year Fiji has recorded eight deaths and 10,969 cases.Tongahas reported over 800 cases and three deaths since declaring an outbreak in February.These outbreaks underscore the region’s vulnerability to climate-sensitive diseases, which are expected to intensify as global temperatures rise.Pacific Island countries produce just 0.03% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), but face some of the most severe climate-related health threats, including vector-borne diseases.Recent months have brought extreme rainfall to parts of the Pacific including Palau, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, while severe drought has gripped parts of the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, Nauru andFiji, according to the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA). Forecasts show these contrasts will continue into October.View image in fullscreenMoataa village, Upolu, Samoa.

The Cook Islands has conducted island-wide clean-ups, intensified surveillance and targeted spraying. Tonga has worked with the WHO to bolster its outbreak response in its worst-hit islands, while Tuvalu has turned to social media and health campaigns to promote preventive measures. Samoa has held school clean-ups and boosted public health messaging. New Zealand has sent a clinical team and NZ$300,000 ($178,000) worth of medical supplies to Samoa, alongside on-the-ground personnel and ongoing coordination with Samoan health officials.But experts say these measures are being undermined by inadequate surveillance.“Current disease surveillance systems are rarely sufficient to manage dengue, as evidenced by the continual growth of dengue in the region, and more generally globally,” said Dr Bobby Reiner, disease ecologist at the Institute forHealthMetrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.Mosquito control tools are methods used to reduce the population of Aedes mosquitoes that spread dengue, such as removing breeding sites, applying larvicides or spraying insecticides. They can also include biological controls, personal protection measures and community clean-up campaigns to prevent mosquito bites and transmission.Still, Reiner said many mosquito control tools had never been proven to reduce transmission, with most responses reactive and often “wastefully chasing the outbreak, applying effort too late”.Explore more on these topicsPacific islandsSamoaFijiTongaDengue feverAsia PacificClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

It had relatively large eyes – approaching the size of tennis balls – and a short snout with deeply rooted teeth for gripping and tearing.“This was a really gnarly whale that I personally wouldn’t want to get in the water with,” Fitzgerald said.This Jurassic-era relic has survived 150 million years on Earth – now it’s one big fire from extinctionRead more“It’s essentially a little whale with big eyes and a mouth full of sharp, slicing teeth,” said co-author Ruairidh Duncan, a researcher at the Museums Victoria Research Institute and Monash University. “Imagine the shark-like version of a baleen whale – small and deceptively cute, but definitely not harmless.”Duncan and Fitzgerald described the new species in theZoological Journal of the Linnean Societyfrom an “exceedingly rare” fossil find that included a partial skull, ear bone and eight teeth – key features that enabled the scientists to identify it as a new species.When fully grown, the species was probably about 3m long. But the fossil was most likely a juvenile, based on its wide open root canals, barely worn teeth and bone connections that were not as tightly fused as in a mature specimen. “This individual was probably no more than about two to 2.2m long,” Fitzgerald said. “You could fit it on to a beach towel.”Janjucetus dullardilived during the Oligocene (30-23 million years ago) – about halfway back to the extinction of the dinosaurs – a time of global warmth and rising seas. It was the fourth known species from a group known as mammalodontids, unusual animals that were an “early offshoot” of the baleen whale family tree, Fitzgerald said.View image in fullscreenDr Erich Fitzgerald with the teeth and partial fossil skull ofJanjucetus dullardi.Photograph: Tom Breakwell/Museums VictoriaHe said evidence from fossils of tiny plankton from the Jan Juc Formation – the same kind of rock–suggested sea temperatures in southern Australia would have been warmer then, more akin to subtropical waters off Coffs Harbour.“In these seas, there was this extraordinary abundance of life, including all these little whales, giant penguins, sharks – about a third, or even twice as long as today’s great white shark – and various other primitive dolphins and other species of whales. It was a very different world,” Fitzgerald said.It was a turning point in the history of life in the oceans, and the beginning of an explosion in the diversification of whales and dolphins.Flinders University palaeontologist Prof John Long, who was not involved in the paper, said the fossil was a remarkable find that could help uncover the evolutionary steps as early carnivorous whales transitioned to become filter feeders.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In recognition of his contribution, the new species was named in his honour.This highlighted the critical role thatmembers of the publiccontinued to play in Australian palaeontology, Fitzgerald said. “It’s a reminder that world-changing fossils can be found in your own back yard.”“Victoria has got a rich fossil heritage,” said Long. “I grew up in Melbourne and collected fossils as a kid since I was seven.

But Bullock made it clear that the RBA just needed to tick a couple of boxes before taking the plunge.Now, the vision is much blurrier. The board is taking things “meeting by meeting”, the governor said a number of times.What would potentially determine when we might get another cut?She responded with a laundry list of data that the central bank’s policy board considers when they make their decisions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zelenskyy also warned that Russia was planning new offensives on three parts of the frontline.Speaking to journalists in the run-up to the Trump-Putin summit, and a day before a virtual meeting with US and European leaders, Zelenskyy said he believed Putin wanted to dominate his country because he “does not want a sovereign Ukraine”.It was therefore dangerous, Zelenskyy said, for Ukraine to be forced by the US into accepting Russia’s demand to take over the parts of Donbas it does not control after the Alaska summit. The region sought by Russia amounted to “about 90,000 square kilometres” of the country, he said.EU leaders defend Ukraine’s freedom to decide future ahead of Trump-Putin summitRead moreLast week Russia indicated it was prepared to consider a ceasefire in the Ukraine war for the first time, in exchange for Ukraine withdrawing from the parts of Donbas it still controlled. Though Trump then suggested that Russia and Ukraine could engage in some “swapping of territories”, Zelenskyy said he understood that Russia was “simply offering not to advance further, not to withdraw from anywhere” and that swaps were not on the table.Map“We will not leave Donbas. We cannot do it,” Zelenskyy said. “For Russians, Donbas is a springboard for a future new offensive.” The region demanded by Russia was too strategically important to give up, he said, because it was a heavily fortified area that protected Ukraine’s central cities.“I have heard nothing – not a single proposal – that would guarantee that a new war will not start tomorrow and that Putin will not try to occupy at least Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv” once Russia had gained all of Donbas, Zelenskyy said.Ukraine’s leader said he wanted Putin instead to agree to a ceasefire on the current frontlines and for both sides to return all prisoners of war and missing children, before any discussion about territory and the future security of the country. “Any question of territory cannot be separated from security guarantees,” he said.Zelenskyy said he would not be at the summit in Alaska, the first face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin with both in office since 2018. But he said he hoped it would be followed by “a trilateral meeting” with Trump and Putin, though the Russian leader has so far said he is not willing to meet Zelenskyy.The Ukrainian leader also expressed faith in the unpredictable Trump, who he said could act as an honest broker between himself and Putin. “I do not believe that Putin’s proposal is Trump’s proposal,” he said. “I believe that Trump represents the United States of America. He is acting as a mediator – he is in the middle, not on Russia’s side. Let him not be on our side but in the middle.”He said he did not know what exactly Putin and Trump were going to discuss in Alaska, saying “probably there is a bilateral track” of talks about other topics of mutual interest, such as trade, sanctions and business. But he said Putin had scored a diplomatic win in securing the meeting: “He is seeking, excuse me, photographs. He needs a photo of his meeting with President Trump.”Zelenskyy said Russia was desperately trying to show it was winning the war and that the Kremlin wanted “to create a certain narrative, especially in the American media, that Russia is moving forward and Ukraine is losing” by mounting sabotage attacks in the Donbas region.He acknowledged that “groups of Russians advanced about 10 kilometres in several places” although he said: “They have no equipment, only weapons in their hands,” and said that some had already been killed or captured.But the breach is ill-timed from Ukraine’s point of view. In Alaska, Putin is likely to tell Trump that such successes show that Russia is gradually winning the three-year war in the east, and so US future support for Kyiv will be wasted.Map showing Russian advancesWar maps showed two lines of advance east of the town of Dobropillya, and gains of about six miles since Friday. Experts said the next few days would be critical to see if Ukraine could contain the break in the front.Ukraine’s military said Russia had concentrated about 110,000 troops in the sector and that the invaders were “brazenly attempting to infiltrate our defensive lines with sabotage and small infantry groups, regardless of their losses”.The military command said in a social media post that reserves had been deployed at the order of Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine’s chief military commander, in an effort to restore the frontlines.View image in fullscreenResidents of Drobopillya and nearby villages are  evacuated on Tuesday.Photograph: Pierre Crom/Getty ImagesThe Institute for the Study of War said Russian “sabotage and reconnaissance groups” had infiltrated Ukrainian-held territory near Dobropillya, a key supply point in the west of the Donetsk region.“It is premature to call the Russian advances in the Dobropillya area an operational-level breakthrough,” the ISW said on Monday night. It said the invaders would now try to turn “tactical advances” into something more significant.Russia is taking heavy casualties of about 1,000 a day, with 500 killed and 500 wounded on Monday, Zelenskyy said, as it relies heavily on infantry assaults to break Kyiv’s defensive lines.Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s casualties on the same day were much smaller – a total of 340 – “18 killed and 243 wounded, with 79 missing in action”. But in the past when Moscow’s forces have broken through, Ukraine has frequently proved unable to push them back.A former senior Ukrainian army officer, Bohdan Krotevych, said the piercing of Ukraine’s lines had come about because “instead of reinforcing defensive units with infantry”, senior commanders in Kyiv had prioritised deploying newly mobilised soldiers into assault forces, leaving units already on the frontline weakened.“To stabilise the front, we must reinforce brigades on the line of contact with infantry,” Krotevych said, and he called for Ukraine to urgently strengthen its reserve forces and adopt a defensive strategy rather than try to counter high-risk Russian infantry assaults with its own.Dobropillya is a key supply point for the beleaguered towns of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad to the south and the principal cities of Ukrainian-held Donbas to the east from the centre of the country.Zelenskyy said Russia was preparing a fresh offensive in the autumn involving nearly 30,000 troops moved from Sumy, in the north-east of Ukraine, “in three directions” on the frontline – towards Zaporizhzhia in the south and Pokrovsk and the nearby Novopavlika in the south-east.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

InSpain, a Romanian man in his 50s died after suffering 98% burns while trying to rescue horses from a burning stable near Madrid on Monday night.A four-year-old boy who was found unconscious in his family’s car in Sardinia died in Rome on Monday after suffering irreversible brain damage caused by heatstroke. And in Montenegro, one soldier died and another was seriously injured when their water tanker overturned while fighting wildfires in the hills north of the capital, Podgorica, on Tuesday.Scientist have warned that the heat currently affecting large parts ofEuropeis creating perfect conditions for wildfires and serving as another reminder of the climate emergency.Canada wildfire season already second worst on record as experts warn of ‘new reality’Read more“Thanks to climate change, we now live in a significantly warmer world,” Akshay Deoras, a research scientist at the University of Reading’s meteorology department told Agence France-Presse, adding that “many still underestimate the danger”.The fire in Tres Cantos, near Madrid – which had been fuelled by winds of 70km/h (45mph) and which has devoured 1,000 hectares of land – was still not under control on Tuesday evening, when further strong gusts were expected. The regional government said it had recovered 150 dead sheep and 18 dead horses from the area.More than 3,700 people were evacuated from 16 municipalities amid dozens of reported blazes in the north-western region of Castilla y León, including one that damaged the Unesco world heritage-listed Roman-era mining site at Les Médulas.Authorities in neighbouring Galicia said the largest wildfire of the year had burned through 3,000 hectares of land in Ourense province. In the southern town of Tarifa, firefighters on the ground and in planes battled a fire that broke out on Monday, with 2,000 people evacuated.The blazes have led the interior ministry to declare a “pre-emergency phase” to help coordinate emergency resources.View image in fullscreenFirefighters work to extinguish a forest fire in Lamas de Olo, in the Alvao natural park, Portugal.Photograph: Pedro Sarmento Costa/EPAThe prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, offered his condolences to the family of the man who died after the Tres Cantos fire, and thanked the emergency services for their “tireless efforts”.He urged people to recognise the seriousness of the situation. “We’re at extreme risk of forest fires,” he said in a message on X on Tuesday. “Let’s be very careful.”In neighbouringPortugal, firefighters were battling three large wildfires in the centre and north of the country.Authorities in Greece requested EU help as fires, fuelled by gale force winds, ripped across vast swathes of the western Peloponnese and emergency services ordered the evacuation of thousands of residents.Firefighters were also trying to contain blazes on the popular Ionian tourist islands of Zakynthos and Kefalonia. With gusts hampering firefighting efforts, emergency services ordered all hotels in the region of Agala and Keri on Zakynthos to temporarily close, forcing suitcase-wielding holidaymakers to flee and relocate to other areas.View image in fullscreenA house burning during a wildfire that erupted in a forest near the village of Agalas on Zakynthos.Photograph: Costas Synetos/EPABy late Tuesday, dozens of firefighters, supported by 15 fire trucks and eight water-bombing planes and helicopters, were still trying to douse the fast-moving flames.“Everything that civil protection can offer is here but there are very strong winds and the fires are out of control,” said the island’s mayor, Giorgos Stasinopoulos. “We need a lot more air support, it’s vital.”The fire service said it was also dealing with blazes farther north in Epirus, around Preveza and in the central region of Aetolia-Acarnania.Despite temperatures nudging 43C in some parts of the Peloponnese region of southern Greece on Tuesday – and the prolonged drought, which has produced highly flammable conditions on tinder-dry soil – officials described the outbreak of so many fires as “suspiciously high”.Faced with an estimated 63 blazes erupting and firefighters confronting flames on 106 fronts, fire officers dispatched specialist teams to several of the stricken regions to investigate possible arson.InAlbania, hundreds of firefighters and troops had subdued most of the nearly 40 fires that flared up in the past 24 hours, the defence ministry said, but more than a dozen were still active.Since the start of July, nearly 34,000 hectares have been scorched nationwide, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. Police say many of the blazes were deliberate, with more than 20 people arrested.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of the blaze in Çanakkale, Turkey, on Tuesday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn Croatia, about 150 firefighters spent Monday night defending homes near the port city of Split.In the north-western Turkish province of Çanakkale, more than 2,000 people were evacuated and 77 people treated in hospital for smoke inhalation after fires broke out near the tourist village of Güzelyalı, authorities said.Images on Turkish media showed homes and cars ablaze, while more than 760 firefighters, 10 planes, nine helicopters and more than 200 vehicles were deployed to battle the flames.Turkeythis year experienced its hottest July since records began 55 years ago.In southern France, where temperature records were broken in at least four weather stations, the government called for vigilance.The south-western city of Bordeaux hit a record 41.6C on Monday, while all-time records were broken at meteorological stations in Bergerac, Cognac and Saint Girons, according to the national weather service, Météo France.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsWildfiresSpainExtreme heatExtreme weatherEuropePortugalTurkeynewsShareReuse this content"

When citizens see this, it does not reflect well on the police,” he said, blaming the problem in part on privatisation of police car maintenance.“It’s a job that’s fun when the conditions are right. But when you take a closer look at the circumstances, sometimes I just want to throw my hands up in despair.”Husgen said the dismal conditions in many police stations were compounding “big problems” recruiting young officers.The trade union supplied Merkur with aseries of photosshowing what it said were ramshackle police buildings with gaping holes in the ceiling and a mouse under a desk as well as cars with foam spilling out of the seats.The GdP said Germany’s 16 federal states needed more support from Berlin to improve conditions for police officers and enable them to carry out their duties.The German parliament in March approved plans spearheaded by the then chancellor elect, Friedrich Merz, to relax the country’s strict debt brake, allowing an increase in defence spending and creating a €500bn “special fund” orSondervermögenfor the next decadededicated to infrastructure overhauls, including increased financing for the federal police.The GdP has said this spending will be “far from sufficient” to address the dramatic shortfalls at the state level and indicated a separateSondervermögenwould be required for domestic security.“In Germany, we in the police forces have an investment backlog in the double-digit billion (euro) range for our property alone,” Husgen said.Asked about the GdP’s complaints, a spokesperson for the federal interior ministry said police matters including police stations and the vehicle fleet “are constitutionally within the jurisdiction of the regional states”.The ministry said the federal government assisted regional police forces in a range of areas including through special programmes for equipment, digital communications and IT infrastructure.The federal government, whose term is due to run until 2029, has also promised to increase financing for special police forces as part of plans to strengthen the domestic security authorities, the spokesperson added.The GdP, founded in 1950, calls itself the“world’s largest police trade union”, with more than 200,000 members across Germany.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She further lowered expectations for any kind of agreement, saying that it would be a “listening exercise” for Trump.Zelenskyy on Tuesday ruled out removing Ukrainian troops from the Donbas region, probably a key aim for Russia, and described the summit as a “victory” for Putin. “First, he will meet on US territory, which I consider his personal victory,” Zelenskyy said. “Second, he is coming out of isolation because he is meeting on US territory. Third, with this meeting, he has somehow postponed sanctions.”Europe has also vocally backed Ukraine. The EU leaders said on Tuesday: “Meaningful negotiations can only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities,” adding: “We share the conviction that a diplomatic solution must protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests.“A Ukraine capable of defending itself effectively is an integral part of any future security guarantees.” They added that EU nations were ready to contribute further to security guarantees.The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, Putin’s longstanding ally in Europe, mocked the statement from his EU counterparts, saying: “The statement attempts to set conditions for a meeting to which leaders of the EU were not invited. The fact that the EU was left on the sidelines is sad enough as it is. The only thing that could make things worse is if we started providing instructions from the bench.” Denying he was Putin’s puppet, he added: “The only sensible action for EU leaders is to initiate an EU-Russia summit, based on the example of the US-Russia meeting.”Zelenskyy said there was no sign of Russia seeking peace, and said it was instead preparing a fresh military offensive. Ukraine admitted it was trying to prevent a decisive Russian breakthrough in the north of the Donetsk region.European leaders are clinging to the hope that Trump’srecent impatience with Putinfor failing to agree a 30-day ceasefire will not dissolve on contact with the Russian leader. Recent signs suggested Trump was slowly hardening his stance towards Russia, including resuming intelligence cooperation with Ukraine, a willingness to supply arms for Ukraine if bought by the EU and the threat of secondary sanctions against countries that traded in Russian oil.But Europe’s painstaking diplomatic progress with Trump, including a successful Nato summit in June, now looks to be at risk.Trump has saidany peace deal would involve“some swapping of territories to the betterment of both” Russia and Ukraine, a phrasing that hides the reality that virtually all the territory in question is Ukrainian. Russia has yet to specify if it will hand back any of the territory it has seized by force since it launched its first military attacks more than 11 years ago.“Meaningful negotiations can only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities,” the European leaders said. They added: “We share the conviction that a diplomatic solution must protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests.”Kallas added: “The sequencing of the steps is important. First, an unconditional ceasefire with a strong monitoring system and ironclad security guarantees.”Ukraine war briefing: Russia preparing for fresh offensives not a ceasefire, Zelenskyy saysRead moreIn the statement early on Tuesday, the leaders were careful not to express criticism of Trump, saying they welcomed “the efforts of President Trump towards ending Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”.They added: “A just and lasting peace that brings stability and security must respect international law, including the principles of independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and that international borders must not be changed by force.”Trump played down the possibility of a breakthrough in Alaska but said he anticipated “constructive conversations” with Putin, a piece of expectation management that is unlikely to reassure European leaders.“This is really a feel-out meeting a little bit,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We’re going to see what he has in mind and if it’s a fair deal, I’ll reveal it to theEuropean Unionleaders and to Nato leaders and also to President Zelenskyy,” Trump said. “I may say: ‘Lots of luck, keep fighting.’ Or I may say: ‘We can make a deal.’”Trump was also critical of Zelenskyy on Monday, noting that Ukraine’s leader had been in power for the duration of the war and said “nothing happened” during that time. He has made it clear that he sees no prospect of Ukraine regaining territory it has lost, and is frustrated that European leaders, worried about Ukrainian morale, remain so reluctant to acknowledge this reality in public. Zelenskyy refers to a de facto loss of territory, but will refuse to accept the loss in any peace treaty.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeEuropean UnionDonald TrumpVladimir PutinAlaskanewsShareReuse this content"

It means an increased risk of death from really common infections. It means more amputations. It’s a horrible picture,” said Krystel Moussally, epidemiology adviser to Médecins Sans Frontières and aco-author of studieson drug-resistant bacteria in Gaza and other conflict zones in the Middle East, who was not involved in the research.Gaza doctors ‘becoming too weak to treat patients’ as hunger crisis deepensRead moreThe study is based on more 1,300 samples from at al-Ahli hospital, where one of the few microbiology laboratories that is still functional in Gaza is based. Two-thirds of the samples, taken from patients over a 10-month period last year, showed the presence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria.Bilal Irfan, one of the authors of the study, described the results as “particularly alarming”.“We don’t even know the true scale because of the destruction of almost all the laboratories and the killing of a lot of the medical staff, so to even get a small insight into what is happening in Gaza is extremely important,” said Irfan, a bioethicist who conducts research at Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s hospital and the University of Michigan.Gaza has suffered for decades from high levels of multi-drug-resistant bacteria as a consequence of repeated conflicts and an Israeli blockade since 2007, when Hamas seized control.But the current context was unprecedented, experts said. Not only hasGaza’s healthcare system been decimatedbut sanitation systems have been destroyed, the disposal of garbage and solid waste has almost stopped and hunger is widespread among the 2.3 million population, making many more vulnerable to infection.On Tuesday, the World Health Organization saidIsraelshould let it stock medical supplies to deal with a “catastrophic” health situation in Gaza.“We want to stock up, and we all hear about more humanitarian supplies are allowed in – well it’s not happening yet, or it’s happening at a way too low a pace,” said Rik Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative in thePalestinian territories.Speaking from Jerusalem, Peeperkorn said Gaza had run out of more than half of medicines and the WHO was able to bring in fewer supplies than it wanted “due to the cumbersome procedures” and products “still denied” entry – a topic of constant negotiation with the Israeli authorities.Peeperkorn said only 50% of hospitals and 38% of primary health care centres were functioning, and even then only partly. Bed occupancy has reached 240% capacity in the Al-Shifa hospital and 300% at Al-Ahli hospital, both in northern Gaza.“The overall health situation remains catastrophic,” he said. “Hunger and malnutrition continue to ravage Gaza”.IsraeliMinistry of Defence officialssaid more than 45,000 tonnes of medical equipment had been transferred to Gaza since the beginning of the war and 13 fully equipped field hospitals established by international aid organisations.“Israel will continue to allow the entry of medical equipment and medicines into the Gaza Strip in accordance with international law and in coordination with the international community, while taking all possible measures to prevent the terrorist organisationHamasfrom seizing the aid and exploiting it for terrorist and military purposes,” the officials said.At least89 Palestinians, 31 seeking aid, have been killedand 513 injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza in the past 24 hours, according to the territory’s health ministry.Israel’s offensive in Gaza has now killed a total of 61,599 Palestinians and injured 154,088 since 7 October 2023.Q&AHow many Palestinians have been killed in Israel's campaign against Gaza?ShowAccording to health officials in Gaza, at least 60,000 people have been killed during Israel’s current military campaign, launched after the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 which killed nearly 1,200 people.The actual death toll is likely to be significantly higher, as the figure only includes Palestinians killed by bombs or bullets whose bodies have been recovered, leaving out thousands trapped under the rubble or killed by starvation and other indirect victims of the campaign.According to the data – which includes the deaths of militants – women, children, and elderly people account for approximately 55% of the recorded deaths.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Three-quarters of the samples studied by Irfan and the other authors of the new study were taken from casualties suffering traumatic wounds inflicted by Israeli airstrikes or similar attacks.In the Lancet, the authors said the threat from drug-resistant bacteria would escalate unless there was an end to the Israeli offensive and the “deliberate targeting of hospitals, laboratories and water desalination plants”.Moussally said that the problem had been made worse by massive contamination of water sources and “no proper immunisation programmes” during the war.The conflict was triggered by a surprise attack by Hamas into Israel in which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted about 250 hostages, of whom 50 remain in Gaza. Only 20 are believed to still be alive.Explore more on these topicsGazaAntibioticsDrug resistanceIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The ministers and the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, called on the government of Israel to let in aid shipments immediately and allow essential humanitarian actors to operate in Gaza. “Urgent action is needed now to halt and reverse starvation,” they said.Late on Tuesday, Netanyahu again raised the prospect that Palestinians would leave the Gaza Strip, telling Israeli broadcaster i24NEWS that “we are not pushing them out, but we are allowing them to leave”.“Give them the opportunity to leave, first of all, combat zones, and generally to leave the territory, if they want,” he said, drawing a parallel with refugee outflows during wars in Syria, Ukraine and Afghanistan.Previous suggestions by Israeli politicians and Donald Trump that Palestinians could leave Gaza have been condemned asillegal and dangerous calls for ethnic cleansing.Anthony Albanese says Benjamin Netanyahu is ‘in denial’ about crisis in GazaRead moreMore than 15 people were killedwhile waiting for food distributionat the Zikim crossing in northern Gaza, said Fares Awad, head of the ambulance services in northern Gaza.In the south of the territory, five people, including a couple and their child, were killed by an Israeli airstrike on a house in the city of Khan Younis and four by a strike on a tent encampment in nearby Mawasi, medics said.People killed and injured while seeking aid in GazaThe civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal said the residential neighbourhoods of Zeitoun and Sabra had been hit “with very heavy airstrikes targeting civilian homes, possibly including high-rise buildings”.The bombardment was described by residents as the heaviest in weeks. “It sounded like the war was restarting,” Amr Salah, 25, told Reuters. “Tanks fired shells at houses, and several houses were hit, and the planes carried out what we call fire rings, whereby several missiles landed on some roads in eastern Gaza.”‘‘There are martyrs under the rubble that no one can reach because the shelling hasn’t stopped,” said Majed al-Hosary, a resident in Zeitoun.154 people in Gaza have reportedly died of starvation since 21 JulyEleven bodies were recovered from the rubble of previous Israeli attacks, the ministry said on Telegram, including several casualties caused by strikes on Gaza City.The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports and that its forces took precautions to mitigate civilian harm. Separately, it said that its forces had killed dozens of militants in north Gaza over the past month and destroyed more tunnels used by militants in the area.There was no sign on the ground of forces moving deeper into Gaza City aspart of the newly approved Israeli offensive, which was expected to begin in the coming weeks.The most recent famine-related deaths brought the total number of hunger-related deaths recorded since 7 October 2023 to 227, including 103 children, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Nasser Medical Complex confirmed a six-year-old boy had died of hunger-related illness in the southern city of Khan Younis, while doctors said a 30-year-old man had died of malnutrition.Israel has faced mounting criticism over the 22-month-long war with Hamas, with UN-backed expertswarning of widespread famine unfoldingin besieged Gaza.Israel has imposed a blockade and restrictions on aid entering the territory, but in his press conference on Sunday Netanyahu said it was “completely false” that his government was pursuing a “starvation policy”. He acknowledged hunger, and problems with the food distribution system run by the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, but accused the media of “lies” about the scale of the problem.Nearly two years into the conflict, Israel’s war on Gaza has killed a total of 61,599 Palestinians and injured 154,088 since 7 October 2023, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Netanyahu’s Gaza City outrage fulfils his messianic fantasy of a Greater Israel.

The Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights said they would file a joint complaint to the international criminal court over their killings.The Israel Defense Forces admitted carrying out the attack, claiming Sharif was the leader of a Hamas cell responsible for rocket attacks against Israel – an allegation that Al Jazeera and Sharif had previously dismissed as baseless.HRF’s investigation traces the chain of command from Netanyahu to senior Israeli army figures, including air force and intelligence commanders.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, condemned their deaths and his spokesperson called for an independent investigation.The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, said in a post on X: “The Israeli Army continues to silence voices reporting atrocities from Gaza.”“I am horrified by the killing of another five journalists in Gaza City. Since the war began, more than 200 Palestinian journalists have been reported killed in total impunity.”Reuters, AP and AFP contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He, again, reiterated to me what he has said publicly as well – which is to be in denial about the consequences that are occurring for innocent people,” Albanese told ABC TV.Albanese’s Palestinian statehood decision won’t please everyone – but it’s better than the horrifying status quoRead moreAlbanese yesterday said Australia’s pledge to recognise a Palestinian state was “predicated” on conditions agreed to by the Palestinian Authority, which included no role for terror group Hamas in a future government. The prime minister said the international community could block Hamas from standing in future elections in Palestine, but refused to say whether Australia would revoke its plans to recognise if such conditions were not met.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“You can [stop Hamas from standing in elections] if you have the Arab states in the Middle East all speaking as one, as well as the Palestinian Authority, as well as the international community. Yes, you can,” he told Nine.In a press conference, Albanese went on to say that violence in the region, including Israel’s planned military occupation of Gaza City, “just cannot continue into the future without an end point”.“The international community is coming up with an end point, which is, how do we resolve this? How do we get a permanent security position?” he said.Macron, who declared in July that France would recognise Palestinian statehood at the General Assembly, said Australia was “joining the momentum” of a global push toward resolving the crisis in Gaza.“This reflects our commitment to the two-state solution and to the need to collectively rebuild a political pathway, without which there can be no peace and security for all,” he wrote.There are a raft of unanswered questions including how the Palestinian state would be formed, how it would be demilitarised and where Australia would establish an embassy. Albanese and the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, shrugged off repeated questions in media interviews on Monday and Tuesday about how Australia would respond if the Palestinian Authority’s commitments were not met, or if they would reverse their recognition pledge.“What we will also do is work with the international community to hold the Palestinian Authority to its commitments,” Wong told the ABC’s 7.30 program on Monday night.The Coalition opposition is critical of the Labor government’s decision, claiming it rewards Hamas, and that the government has failed to answer outstanding questions.The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, said on Tuesday a future Coalition government would revoke Palestinian recognition, raising questions about how such a diplomatic backflip could be executed three or six years into the future of a newly established Palestine.The Coalition opposed Monday’s decision from the Labor government, claiming Palestinian recognition was a reward for Hamas. Ley said in a statement that the Coalition’s shadow cabinet resolved to oppose a Palestinian state and also “resolved that recognition would be revoked by a Coalition government”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ley’s statement did not go into how Australia would diplomatically untangle recognition of a Palestinian state, three or six years down the track, or how un-recognising a Palestinian state would help contribute to the peace process between Israel and Palestine, or assist broader cohesion in the Middle East.Australia recognising Palestine a ‘political fig leaf’ without sanctions, Palestine Advocacy Network head saysRead moreThe former Liberal prime minister Scott Morrison claimed Jewish Australians would feel a “sense of betrayal” at the government’s shift.“It will prove a hollow gesture, like for all those who have taken this step before it,” Morrison wrote on his website. “None should take any comfort in it. Meanwhile the suffering will regrettably continue in Gaza and the hostages will remain in captivity.”Israel’s government has been deeply critical of Albanese’s decision, and also said Labor is rewarding Hamas.In a statement on X, Israel’s deputy minister of foreign affairs, Sharren Haskel, said the move was about domestic politics, not peace.“Fifty of our hostages remain in Hamas’s dungeons of torture, being starved to death – being forced to dig their own graves – yet the Australian government has decided now is the right time to reward the monsters of October 7 with recognition of a Palestinian state,” she wrote.“This decision by Australia won’t change anything in Israel or Gaza, but let’s be quite clear, this is all about domestic politics, not peace.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsIsraelAnthony AlbaneseBenjamin NetanyahuPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The military and police may detain children in cases where parents who are perceived to be associated with opposition movements cannot be found to arrest. Some of the detained children had been subjected to torture, ill treatment or sexual and gender-based crimes, the report said.The military has conducted mass arrests since the coup, detaining almost 30,000 people, includingpolitical opponents, journalists and activists accused of resisting junta rule, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma), a local group that tracks arrests.The IIMM said it had gathered significant evidence that there was systematic torture inside prison facilities, including beatings, electric shocks, strangulation, torture by pulling out fingernails with pliers, and forms of sexual violence, including rape and gang-rape.Torturehad resulted in death, the report said.Investigators had made progress in identifying specific members and units of security forces “involved in operations at identified detention facilities”, the report added, including direct perpetrators of sexual and gender-based crimes as well as high-level commanders.View image in fullscreenFamily members and colleagues wait for prisoners to be released from Insein prison in Yangon during an amnesty in April.Photograph: Thein Zaw/APThey had also gathered evidence of the identity of individuals – in the security forces and opposition armed groups – who had perpetrated summary executions, the IIMM report said.“It’s very important that perpetrators believe that somebody is watching, somebody is collecting evidence,” said Nicholas Koumjian, the head of IIMM, who said the conflict that had grippedMyanmarsince the coup had become “more and more violent”.It was crucial that there was “commitment from the international community to see justice is done – not just for the people of Myanmar but as an example to the rest of the world also”, said Koumjian.The IIMM report, based on the period July 2024 to June 2025, warned that an unprecedented funding crisis was threatening investigators’ ability to collect and analyse evidence.It said funding constraints had affected the ability of investigators to travel, train and buy the necessary software to conduct their work. Staff positions would be reduced by 20% next year, it added. “These financial pressures threaten the mechanism’s ability to sustain its critical work and to continue supporting international and national justice efforts,” the report said.The UN is pursuing a cost-cutting drive, asking dozens of agencies, offices and operations to cut 20% of their staff, as it faces funding challenges.The IIMM is funded by the UN regular budget, as well as through grants from individual donor countries. Two US funding grants were terminated this year, though one continued, Koumjian said.The Trump administration hasdismantled the US Agency for International Development, a major funder of humanitarian aid programmes around the world, andwithdrawn from some UN agenciesand ordered a broader review of US participation in the agencies.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has previously said efforts to cut back UN costs were due to a liquidity crisis, as member states were failing to pay their annual dues on time or in full.The IIMM has made more than two dozen requests to the Myanmar military, including for information relating to alleged crimes and for access to the country, but received no response.The military could not be reached by the Guardian for comment. It has previously denied atrocities have taken place and said its operations were in response to “terrorists” who were causing unrest.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarChildrenUnited NationsTortureSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

More than 200 residents have supposedly signed up to Safeguard Force, which claims it will carry out uniformed patrols in the seaside town to protect “women, children and the elderly”.Begum said this type of behaviour had been triggered by a “breakdown of the social contract” and a failure of politicians to deal with economic deprivation.“We know that vigilantism is not regulated, it’s not rational, it is an emotional reaction to a situation where people are feeling desperate and are feeling let down and are feeling angry,” she said.“And this has implications for all people of colour in this country, because people are not checking people’s migrant status or whether they are seeking asylum before they make their conclusions about whether they belong, whether they are going to be subject to hostility and aggression.”In an effort to placate some concerns about crime, the Home Office announced on Wednesday it was rolling out 10 new live facial recognition vans to seven police forces across the country to locate wanted criminals.It also said every neighbourhood across England and Wales will have a named, contactable officer, with dedicated antisocial behaviour leads and new visible patrols in town centres.Begum said incidents of people being mistaken for migrants were not “innocent mistakes” but happened as a result of politicians and the media pursuing an agenda based on “flimsy or false information”.“For instance, Rupert Lowe has an agenda, he has a particular position on these things … there are thresholds of accountability and scrutiny and checking that he should have gone through,” she said.“I do think there’s a deliberate disingenuousness around this, because it’s convenient and easy to focus on migrants and stopping boats. It’s much, much harder to really deal with big structural issues around economic inequalities and misogyny.”Rupert Lowe reports charity rowers to coastguard as possible ‘illegal migrants’Read moreThelargest anti-migrant protestshave centred around the Bell hotel in Epping in Essex. On Tuesday, the district council applied for an interim high court injunction in an effort to stop asylum seekers from being housed there.Oliver Coppard, the Labour mayor ofSouth Yorkshire, urged politicians and the media to take a responsible approach over predicting disorder connected to asylum and migration, saying some people were “seemingly trying to will it into existence”.Coppard’s region experiencedsome of the worst troublelast summer, when a far-right mob attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers near Rotherham.The area was, he said, “in a very different place now”, adding: “The last thing we need is politicians trying to talk up the chances of that sort of thing happening again.“Politicians of all stripes have a responsibility to be measured in their comments, to try to bring people together. And that’s not what we’re seeing from certain parts of both the Tory party and Reform.”Coppard singled out the Conservative leader,Kemi Badenoch, and the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, saying they were using asylum and migration “as a political football rather than speaking responsibly on behalf of the whole of the country”.Badenoch said on Tuesday that she understood why people in Epping were protesting, and alleged women had “stopped jogging in the park because there are men lurking in bushes”.“The people who I spoke to are having a lot of concerns about safety” she said.“Mothers told me that they’re worried about their daughters going to school. They’re getting harassed. They stopped jogging in the park because there are men lurking in bushes.“Communities shouldn’t have to be paying for this. And what I saw in Epping really, really upset me. I can see why many of those people are protesting.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumMigrationKemi BadenochEssexWalesNorfolkBournemouthnewsShareReuse this content"

The weather was perfect. At first glance, it could have been a joyful community gathering in a sun-dappled Cotswolds village park, but the placards gave the game away.These pulled no punches, criticising the policies and stances championed by the US vice-president,JD Vance, who is enjoying a country break down the road.About 100 people, mostly women, turned up for the “not welcome” party organised by the Stop Trump Coalition on the park opposite the Co-op in Charlbury.“He’s simply not welcome here,” said therapist Sue Moon, from nearby Chipping Norton, who was carrying a placard reading: “Cotswold childless cat ladies say go home” – a referenceto Vance’s typically blunt put-down of Democrats.View image in fullscreenSue Moon: ‘We don’t want anything to do with people like him.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianMoon, who has children and no cats, said the Cotswolds was earning a reputation as a bolt-hole for the rich and powerful – former prime minister David Cameron lives nearby. “That’s not what we’re about. We don’t want anything to do with people like him,” she said.Natasha Phillips – who had travelled 70 miles from Bath to attend the event being billed as a “Dance against Vance” – bore a placard saying: “JD Vance – the guy who bullied a war hero from the comfort of his couch.”“The way he treated Volodymyr Zelenskyywas disgusting,” she said. “The Ukrainian people are heroes. British people admire the way they are standing up to [Vladimir] Putin. I wanted to come here to show that.”Chris Tatton, a long-term resident of Charlbury and a former councillor, said one of the worst things he had seen in a lifetime of watching politics was Vance’s ambush of the Ukrainian president. “That was disgraceful,” he said.His friend, retired union organiser Steve Akers, said even worse for him was the sight of starving children in Gaza. “That wouldn’t happen without this US government.”One placard said: “Make Charlbury great again – go home.” Another said: “Not too posh to protest.” A third: “Rolling hills. Not rolling back climate change.”View image in fullscreenPeople attend the ‘Vance not welcome party’ protest in Charlbury, Cotswolds.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersThere were plenty of versions of the meme of Vance as a bloated baby. In June, a Norwegian man, Mads Mikkelsen, 21, accused American border officials ofdenying him entry into the USbecause he had the meme saved on his phone.More wholesomely, a boy with a skateboard wore a T-shirt with a cheerful Canadian motif. And the organisers had brought along a Colin the Caterpillar cake with an image of Vance’s face attached to it.Rachel, a carer from Banbury, Oxfordshire, said: “I’m most worried about his environmental policies. They risk eliminating the whole of humanity, all the creatures on the Earth.”Over the past few decades, this corner of Oxfordshire has been turned into a celeb-magnet – a place of designer delis, gastropubs, spas and private clubs.It is associated with rightwingers. Jeremy Clarkson’s Diddly Squat farm shop and pub attracts fans of his TV shows and his conservative views (though Clarkson called Vance“a bearded God-botherer”in a Times column earlier this year.)The former Top Gear presenter shared an image on Instagram on Tuesday which highlighted that his farm is under a no-fly zone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the upside, no annoying light aircraft.”Clarkson later sarcastically shared a video of a peaceful Cotswolds scene and wrote: “Utter chaos caused by Vance. How will we ever manage?”In the interest of political balance, Vance’s predecessor as veep, Kamala Harris,was spotted in Charlbury’s pub, the Bull, last month.House prices here have soared, making it hard for local young people to find a place to live. A modern three-bedroomed house in Charlbury will set you back the best part of £500,000. As in rural areas acrossEngland, services such as health and transport are stretched.Vance probably won’t see the issues. He is believed to be staying in an 18th-century manor house, owned by the lightbulb millionaire Johnny Hornby and his wife, Pippa, a London art patron and collector, who are friends of Cameron.Jonathan Mazower, communications director for Survival International, a charity that works with Indigenous peoples, did not attend the “party” but was angry that Vance had been invited.“There’s massive disruption – all roads and footpaths have been closed, all cars are searched, no visitors are allowed in. There are police and US Secret Service agents everywhere,” said Mazower, who lives near the sprawling digs where Vance is staying.“But more important than the disruption is what he represents. On the whole people here are very much live and let live but this is something else entirely. Trump’s No 2 coming here feels like an absolute outrage and imposition.“The massive police and Secret Service presence makes any normal protest impossible, so we’ve had to resort to putting up placards around the village, some of which are being taken down.”Andy Graham, the leader of West Oxfordshire district council, compared the scenes to the Will Smith film Men in Black. “Seeing someone dressed up with black suit, sunglasses, the whole lot, you kind of felt it was a bit over the top really,” he said. “We understand that people do need security but I think they haven’t been discreet about it.”Explore more on these topicsJD VanceEnglandProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

Far-right agitators wrongly claimed that the killer was a Muslim asylum seeker.Deputy chief constable Sam de Reya, the NPCC lead for communications and media, said: “We saw during last summer’s disorder, as well as in several recent high-profile cases, what the major, real-world consequences can be from what information police release into the public domain.“We have to make sure our processes are fit for purpose in an age of social media speculation and where information can travel incredibly quickly across a wide range of channels.“Disinformation and incorrect narratives can take hold in a vacuum. It is good police work for us to fill this vacuum with the facts about issues of wider public interest.”Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor for North West England, cautiously welcomed the decision.“Trust is so low that more transparency is a good thing, as recent experience has shown. It has to be on a case by case basis though,” he said.The Warwickshire police and crime commissioner, Philip Seccombe, called for fresh national guidance afterpolice were accused by Reform UKof failing to confirm that two Afghan men being prosecuted for an alleged attack on a 12-year-old girl were asylum seekers.The alleged rape, said to have happened on 22 July, was at the centre of a political storm after the Reform leader, Nigel Farage, amplified claims of a police cover-up.Ahmad Mulakhil has been charged with rape and Mohammad Kabir has been charged with kidnap and strangulation.Explore more on these topicsPoliceCrimeUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

Though inflation dipped down in the spring, the annualized inflation rate jumped up 0.4% since April.Though the inflation rate stayed stable between June and July, core inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and food industries, went up 3.1% over the last month – a higher pace than what was seen in June.a chart of inflation numbersPrices for takeout and restaurants jumped up 3.9% over the last year, pushing up overall food prices by 2.9%. Prices for used cars, housing and medical care also jumped up higher than the overall rate.Overall energy prices were down 1.6% for the year, what probably stabilized the overall pace of inflation.The report is the latest to show that theUS economyis experiencing some turbulence from Trump’s unparalleled shakeup of US trading policy, despiteinsistencefrom Republicans that the economy is “firing on all cylinders”.On top of a 10% universal tariff on all imports, Trump has sethigher tariffsfor dozens of countries, including the US’s top trading partners. On Monday, hours before a midnight deadline, Trump delayed enacting steep tariffs on China for another 90 days while negotiations continue.Although many of these tariffsonly went into effect7 August, Trump’s 10% universal tariff, along with higher tariffs on certain industries like steel and aluminum, have been in effect since the spring.Economists say that it takes time for tariffs to show up in consumer prices. Some retailers have been stocking up their inventory to delay the impact of tariffs and keep prices stable. But the jump in prices suggests that companies have started to pass down costs to customers, as leaders of companies like Walmart, Nike and Macy’s have said would happen.Tariffs have also hit the labor market harder than economists had anticipated.Datareleased earlier this month dramatically revised down job figures that initially showed a healthy job market. The government had reported 291,000 jobs were added to the economy in May and June, but the revision brought the total down to 33,000.The increase in prices and the shrinking labor market has thrown the USFederal Reserveinto a tight spot. The Fed’s twin mandate is to maximise employment while keeping inflation in check.Trump has lambasted the central bank, arguing it needs to cut rates interest rates in order to spur growth. But Fed officials have refrained from a rate adjustment, citing uncertainty about the impact of Trump’s tariffs on prices.Trump has spent the last few months directing his ire at economic officials – firstat the Fed, and now at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which collects and reports economic data. Just hours after July’s job figures report showed a sluggish month of job growth, TrumpfiredErika McEntarfer, the commissioner of BLS. Citing no evidence, Trump claimed that the job figures “were RIGGEDOn Wednesday, he nominated economistEJ Antoni,longtime critic of the BLS, to oversee the department.After the latest inflation figures were released,Trump claimed: “It has been proven, that even at this late stage, Tariffs have not caused Inflation, or any other problems for America, other than massive amounts of CASH pouring into our Treasury’s coffers.”The president also, once again, attacked Fed chair Jerome Powell and suggested he might sue Powell overcostly renovationsto the Fed’s buildings.“Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell must NOW lower the rate,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. “I am, though, considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed because of the horrible, and grossly incompetent, job he has done in managing the construction of the Fed Buildings.”Explore more on these topicsUS economyInflationEconomicsDonald TrumpFederal ReserveTrump tariffsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They made a bad prediction...on both the Market repercussion and theTariffsthemselves,” he wrote.Trump said Solomon should maybe focus on being a DJ, a hobby Solomon abandoned some time ago, “and not bother running a major Financial Institution”.The bank CEO is the latest corporate boss to become the target of Trump’s ire.A Goldman Sachs spokesperson declined to comment. A spokesperson for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Since 1 February, when Trump kicked off trade wars by slapping levies on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, at least 333 companies worldwide have reacted to the tariffs in some manner, as of Tuesday, according to a Reuters tracker.While Trump did not specify which Goldman research he was referring to, the Wall Street bank – like many of its peers – has taken a bearish stance on Trump‘s tariffs.In a note published on Sunday, Goldman Sachs analysts, led by chief economist Jan Hatzius, said US consumers had absorbed 22% of tariff costs through June and that figure could rise to 67% if recent tariffs continue on the same trajectory.“I think that David should go out and get himself a new economist,” Trump wrote. Hatzius declined to comment.In April, Goldman also warned sweeping US tariffs would weigh on global growth and prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates more aggressively than previously expected.Last week, the president demanded Intel chief Lip Bu-Tan resign due to his ties to Chinese firms, and has repeatedly targeted Apple boss Tim Cook for making US-sold iPhones outside the country.Trump has also taken aim at other Wall Street banks, alleging, without providing evidence, that JP Morgan and Bank of America discriminated against him by refusing his deposits after his first term.As the second quarter earnings season progresses, companies have reported a combined financial hit of $13.6bn to $15.2bn between 16 July and 8 August for the full year from Trump‘s tariffs, according to Reuters’ global tariff tracker.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsGoldman SachsDonald TrumpTariffsShareReuse this content"

He had pleaded not guilty in January to a nine-count indictment charging him with securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud and money-laundering conspiracy.Accused of misleading investors in 2021 about TerraUSD – a so-called stablecoin designed to maintain a value of $1 – Kwon pleaded guilty to the two counts under an agreement with the Manhattan US attorney’s office, which brought the charges.He faces up to 25 years in prison when Engelmayer sentences him on 11 December, though prosecutor Kimberly Ravener said the government had agreed to advocate for a prison term of no more than 12 years, provided he accepts responsibility for his crimes. He has been detained since his extradition fromMontenegrolate last year.Kwon is one of several cryptocurrency moguls to face federal charges after a slump in digital token prices in 2022 prompted the collapse of a number of companies.Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the US’s largest crypto exchange,FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2024.‘He knew it was wrong’: Sam Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years in prison over FTX fraudRead moreProsecutors alleged that when TerraUSD slipped below its $1 peg in May 2021, Kwon told investors a computer algorithm known as “Terra Protocol” had restored the coin’s value. Instead, they said, he arranged for a high-frequency trading firm to secretly buy millions of dollars of the token to artificially prop up its price.Prosecutors said that false claim and others drove retail and institutional investors to buy Terraform products and boost the value of Luna – a more traditional token that fluctuated in value but was closely linked to TerraUSD – to $50bn by the spring of 2022.In court, Kwon apologized for his conduct.“I made false and misleading statements about why it regained its peg by failing to disclose a trading firm’s role in restoring that peg,” Kwon said. “What I did was wrong.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

China will also postpone for 90 days the addition of US firms it had targeted in April to trade and investment restriction lists.“We hope that the US will work with China to follow the important consensus reached during the phone call between the two heads of state … and strive for positive outcomes on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,” a foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said in an earlier statement on Monday.Chinese and US officials said theyexpectedthe pause to be extended after the most recent round of trade talks held last month in Stockholm. Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, said last week the US had “the makings” of a trade deal with China and that he was optimistic about a path forward.Failure to reach a deal would have major consequences. Trump had threatened tariffs on China as high as 245%, with China threatening retaliatory tariffs of 125%, setting off a trade war between the world’s largest economies.On Sunday, Trumppostedon TruthSocial that China should quadruple its purchases of soybeans from the US to help reduce the trade deficit between the US and China.Currently, US exports to China are subject to tariffs of about 30%, with imports from China subject to a baseline tariff of 10% and a 20% extra tariff in response to fentanyl smugglingallegationsagainst China.

I have done it for 38 years now, living paycheck to paycheck,” 54-year-old Thompson said, noting in Missouri workers are notmandatedbreaks of any kind during work.So whenRepublicansin Missouri repealed apaid sick leave mandatethat the state’s voters approved by 58% after an aggressive lobbying campaign by the Missouri chamber of commerce and industry and other business industry groups, he said, “It was a literal gut punch.“If you’re not paid for missed days, it literally means food off your table, bills unpaid, rent unpaid, then that can lead towards homelessness. Some of the people I know in the movement are currently homeless but still are fighting back against this,” said Thompson. “I was very disappointed and disgusted that hard-working taxpayers this would have helped matter so little to them.” Thompson helped gather signatures for the paid-sick-leave and minimum-wage-increase ballot initiative because of his experiences of working through illnesses and losing income when he had to take time off to care for his ailing mother.Workers and labor groups inMissouristrongly criticized the repeal, arguing elected officials chose to side with “greed” over workers, as efforts to re-enact the law and prevent legislators from overturning voter ballot initiatives in Missouri are under way.The state’s house and senate passed HB567,signedinto law on 10 July by the governor, Mike Kehoe, which repealed the paid sick leave mandate and annual minimum wage increases tied to the consumer price index beyond the increase to $15 an hour in 2016 that voters also approved.Voters in Nebraska, bymore than 74.5%, and Alaska, withnearly 57%approval, also passed paid sick leave mandates in November 2024.

He came home to find her unconscious and unresponsive after she suffered a stroke.“At the time I was caring for her, her expenses, my expenses, and we were trying to keep the apartment we were in, all these pressures on me, if I had paid sick time off and I had been able to stay with her that day, I wonder if things could have been different,” Eiker added.Though voters all approved paid sick leave in states where Republicans have dominated in statewide elections, only Republicans in Missouri have pushed to entirely repeal paid sick leave approved by voters.The repeal law in Missouri goes into effect on 28 August, just weeks after the paid sick leave mandate took effect in May 2025.Proponents of paid sick leave criticized the repeal given the strong support for it and that negotiations were under way to reach a compromise.“I think we were 95% of the way on a negotiated agreement, one that I wouldn’t have been happy with, because it would have been different than what the voters had passed. But at the end of the day, elected officials, I think, weren’t so much concerned with paid sick days. I think they were more concerned with the idea that working people have power over our lives,” said Richard von Glahn, policy director at Missouri Jobs With Justice, a worker advocacy group based in St Louis that worked on the paid sick leave ballot initiative.“I think that was the more important issue for the chamber of commerce and elected officials to try to push back on, because I think they’re really terrified that working people have a sense of our own agency in a state like this.”He argued the paid sick leave campaign to gather signatures and speak with voters “were easy because paid sick days are such common sense to most people”.“Even on a day where Missourians sort of overwhelmingly voted forDonald Trump, Josh Hawley and Governor Kehoe, they also overwhelmingly voted for an increase in paid sick days,” Von Glahn said. “Any notion that there’s really a Republican party, that is a party of workers, Missouri shows just how much of a stranglehold corporate interests still have on the Republican establishment. I think that’s a cautionary tale for working-class people.”Groups in Missouri areweighinga new ballot initiative to enshrine the law in the state’s constitution, and a 2026 ballot initiative has been filed to require at least 80% of the state legislature to repeal all or parts of a voter-approved measure.The paid sick leave mandate was repealed as the Missouri chamber of commerce and industrycalledthe bill to do so its “top priority” during the 2025 legislative session, though repealing the law through the legislature was initially seen as challenging given the strong public support for it.“Some legislators may look at this and go, we don’t want to goof with it at all because the percentage was so high in support of it,” Ray McCarty, CEO of Associated Industries of Missouri, said in aninterviewwith the Missouri Independent in November 2024.Opponents of the paid sick leave billclaimedit was “a job killer”, acommon refrainin opposition to paid sick leave policies for years, though data and research have shown paid sick leave improves workforce participation and lowers employee turnover, especially of women, in addition to addinghealth benefits.The authors of the bill to repeal the paid sick leave mandate in the state house and senate did not respond to multiple requests for comment.View image in fullscreenMike Kehoe after being sworn in as the state’s 58th governor on 13 January 2025.Photograph: Emily Curiel/The Kansas City Star/Tribune News Service/Getty ImagesIn an email, a spokesperson for Kehoe claimed “out of state special interests” played a significant role in passing the voter-approved Proposition A, though they did not name who they believe those were.“HB567 protects families, job creators, and small businesses by rolling back government overreach, cutting red tape, and eliminating costly mandates,” the spokesperson added. “This law promotes freedom for workers to find jobs that fit their needs and for businesses to offer the benefits that work best for them – ensuring Missouri’s future is driven by its own people and economy.”Thompson could not disagree more. In 2020, when he worked at Burger King, he said, he had to take eight weeks off work, all unpaid, because his mother’s cancer had reached an inoperable stage and she was put on palliative care through hospice.“I moved in with her and cared for her, cooked meals, made sure she took her meds,” explained Thompson. “I had to go to food pantries and rely on the charity of family and neighbors to feed us. She was in hospice care for eight weeks and passed away. I wasn’t paid for that time away from work. No one should go through this working in the richest country in the world.”"

However, he withdrew from the US track and field trials in July, writing on X: “Taking some time out to get back on track. The 100m should be a straight sprint. 2025 has presented many hurdles. Thanks to all my supporters.”On a busy day for athletics, the Swedish pole vaulter Mondo Duplantis broke the world record for the 13th time by clearing 6.29m at the Gyulai Istvan Memorial in Budapest.The Swedish vaulter was pushed by his Greek rival Emmanouil Karalis with both men flying over 6.02m on their first attempts.But Duplantis then cleared 6.11m before moving the bar to 6.29m – a 1cm increase on the world‑record height he cleared in Stockholm in June – before soaring over it on his second try.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

His statistics, while still impressive, back that up when considering the standard Kelce set in his previous seven Pro Bowl seasons.As the world knows, Kelce’s life has been in a brighter spotlight given his highly publicized relationship withTaylor Swift– you’ve likely heard of her – and a slate of off-field ventures. The 35-year-old has hosted Saturday Night Live, landed a role in Ryan Murphy’s Grotesquerie, appeared in Happy Gilmore 2 alongside Adam Sandler, and taken on a hosting gig for Amazon’s Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? He also keeps busy with the New Heights podcast he co-hosts with his brother, Jason, where Swift this week announced her new album.To that respect, the certain future Pro Football Hall of Famer told GQin a cover story released Tuesdaythat some of those pursuits may have impacted his play.“I think it might have slipped a little bit because I did have a little bit more focus in trying to set myself up,” Kelce said. “And opportunities came up where I was excited to venture into a new world of acting and being an entertainer.”He was quick to stress he doesn’t regret taking on those opportunities. “I don’t say this as ‘I shouldn’t have done it,’” Kelce said. “I’m just saying that my work ethic is such that I have so much pride in how I do things that I never want the product to tail off, and I feel like these past two years haven’t been to my standard.”Kelce posted seven consecutive 1,000-yard seasons from 2016 through 2022 before falling short of that mark in each of the past two. The four-time first-team All-Pro and 10-time Pro Bowl selection made 97 receptions for 823 yards last season – his lowest yardage total since 2014 – and had just three touchdown catches, down from a career-high 12 in 2022.The Chiefs’loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowllast February still lingers for him. “I just have such a motivation to show up this year for my guys,” Kelce said.As for what comes next when hisNFLcareer ends, Kelce isn’t entirely sure. “I don’t necessarily know if I’ll take it and run with it when I’m done playing,” he told GQ. “But I know that I want to stay around the football world as a profession and then dabble in other areas as well.”Kelce also addressed the constant attention surrounding his relationship with Swift, who was a regular at Chiefs games last season. “Whenever I’m with her, we’re just regular people,” he said. “When there is not a camera on us, we’re just two people that are in love. It can be perceived as something else because of how much it is talked about and how much we are tracked whenever we do go out, but I would say that it’s as normal of … it happened very organically even though from a media standpoint it was being tracked.”He added: “Nothing I’ve ever done has been a controlled, organized process. When I say it was so organic, we fell in love just based off the people we were sitting in a room together with. We are two fun-loving people who have the morals to appreciate everyone for who they are. We share all those values. It kind of just took the fuck off.”Kelce will have the chance to prove his renewed focus when the Chiefs open their season at home against the Los Angeles Chargers on 5 September.Explore more on these topicsTravis KelceKansas City ChiefsNFLTaylor SwiftUS sportsShareReuse this content"

I overly appreciate y’all supporting me and showing love and even holding me accountable to being my best self. So more than anything, I refused to run away … but face everything that comes to me head-on because everything on the other side is greater but you gotta go through in order to get there.”Richardson issued an apology to Coleman that read in part, “I apologize to Christian. He came into my life and gave me more than a relationship but a greater understanding of unconditional love from what I’ve experienced in my past. Due to my past trauma and pain, I was blind and blocked off to not only receive it but give it. I love him and to him I can’t apologize enough.“As security footage of the incident became public, Coleman told the Athletic in a video interview: “She’s a human being, and a great person. She has a lot of things going on, a lot of emotions and forces going on inside of her that not only I can’t understand, but nobody can. She’s one of one. And I’m one of one, too.“I feel like it was just a sucky situation all around, I don’t feel as if she should have been arrested.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

I was like, ‘Yeah, I see two balls.’ These are obviously symptoms that you can’t ignore,” Seles said. “And, for me, this is when this journey started. And it took me quite some time to really absorb it, speak openly about it, because it’s a difficult one. It affects my day-to-day life quite a lot.”Interview: Monica SelesRead moreSeles, who won her first major, the 1990 French Open, at the age of 16 and played her last match in 2003, said she was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis three years ago and is speaking publicly about it for the first time before this month’s US Open to raise awareness of the condition.The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke calls it “a chronic neuromuscular disease that causes weakness in the voluntary muscles” and “most commonly impacts young adult women (under 40) and older men (over 60) but … can occur at any age, including childhood”. There is currently no known cure.The 51-year-old said she’d never heard of the condition until she was referred to a neurologist after noticing symptoms such as double vision and weakness in her arms – “just blowing my hair out … became very difficult,” she said – and legs.“When I got diagnosed, I was like, ‘What?!’” said Seles. “So this is where – I can’t emphasize enough – I wish I had somebody like me speak up about it.”The disease can also cause difficulty in swallowing, speaking and affect facial expressions.It’s been three decades since Seles returned to competition at the 1995 US Open, making it to the final, more than two years aftershe was stabbed at a tournamentin Germany.“The way they welcomed me … after my stabbing, I will never forget,” Seles said about the fans in New York. “Those are the moments that stay with you.”Seles says she is learning to live a “new normal” and characterized her health as another in a series of life steps that required adapting.“I had to, in tennis terms, I guess, reset – hard reset – a few times. I call my first hard reset when I came to the US as a young 13-year-old [from Yugoslavia]. Didn’t speak the language; left my family. It’s a very tough time. Then, obviously, becoming a great player, it’s a reset, too, because the fame, money, the attention, changes [everything], and it’s hard as a 16-year-old to deal with all that. Then obviously my stabbing – I had to do a huge reset,” Seles said.“And then, really, being diagnosed with myasthenia gravis: another reset. But one thing, as I tell kids that I mentor: ‘You’ve got to always adjust. That ball is bouncing, and you’ve just got to adjust. And that’s what I’m doing now.”Seles won nine grand slam singles titles during her playing career, with Wimbledon being the only major she missed out on, although she did reach the final in 1992. Her 178 weeks at No 1 is sixth all-time in WTA history.Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Fan groups of the clubs have already threatened legal action if the plan progresses, and now Real have expressed their opposition to the move.“Real Madrid would like to express to its members, supporters and football fans in general its strongest rejection of the proposal to play outside Spain the match … betweenVillarrealand Barcelona,” the club said in a statement.Football Daily | La Liga, where every team plays each other home and away. Unless they’re in MiamiRead more“The measure, promoted without prior information or consultation with the clubs participating in that competition, violates the essential principle of territorial reciprocity that governs two-round league competitions [one game at home and the other at the opposing team’s], altering the competitive balance and granting an undue sporting advantage to the applicant clubs.“The integrity of the competition requires that all matches be held under the same conditions for all teams. Unilaterally modifying this regime breaks the equality between contenders, compromises the legitimacy of the results and sets an unacceptable precedent that opens the door to exceptions based on interests other than strictly sporting, with a clear impact on sporting integrity and the risk of adulteration of the competition.“If this proposal is carried out, its consequences would be so serious that they would mean a before and after for the world of football.”Real said they had asked Fifa not to authorise the staging of the game without the prior consent of allLa Ligaclubs, and had asked Uefa to urge the Spanish football federation (Rfef) to withdraw the request.Villarreal had earlier pledged that season ticket holders would be offered free travel and entry if the league game was moved to Miami. The club also said those who cannot go, or do not wish to go, would receive a 20% discount on the total cost of their season ticket.If Villarreal andBarcelonaultimately get the green light, La Liga will be the first of Europe’s top five leagues to stage a match overseas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But is Dana White’s Trump bond a liability?The octagon is more international than ever – so why is Dana White still tied to an administration that seeks to isolate large parts of its audience?Beau DureTue 12 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 09.53 EDTShareForget for a moment the stereotype thatMMAathletes and their fans are All-American bar fighters. The MMA community is far more diverse and far more cerebral than the casual onlooker realizes.Has Dana White forgotten that?The UFC president has long sought to expand the sport’s appeal to as many demographics as possible. But in the past few years, he has bet big ona tight affiliation with Donald Trump, who has been perfectly content to revel in the adulation of one segment of the population while heaping scorn upon all others. White has campaigned for Trump, welcomed him to several UFC events and hasn’t immediately smacked down the notion ofholding a UFC cardat the White House.On the surface, that might seem logical. MMA culture is intertwined with bro culture, and bros are considered the antithesis of “woke” liberalism.But it’s not that simple. Consider a startling fact: while Maga champions an “America First” ideology, the UFC is a paragon of globalism.Of the 11 reigning UFC champions, only one is American – Kayla Harrison, thriving in an organization White once insisted would exclude women. Both Australia and Georgia (the country) boast twice as many champions as the UFC’s home country. The only belt firmly held by US fighters is theunofficial ‘BMF’ (Baddest Motherfucker) belt. White invented this to reward charismatic fighters who put on great shows. While it’s a clever way to encourage personality and panache, it also seems like a DEI program to ensure US fighters remain prominent in the UFC pantheon.So theUFCroster is more global than ever. But UFC fighters haveneverfit neatly into categories.This diversity was a hallmark of the reality show that broke the UFC into the mainstream, The Ultimate Fighter. The casts included cerebral chess players, devout Christians and someone who brought a compass to ensure that his bed would face north, and another who fled the show to reassure his girlfriend that rumors she saw online weren’t true.And the UFC evolved in ways that might be considered “progressive.” Cain Velasquez didn’t lose any noticeable fan support in 2010 when he sported a “Brown Pride” tattoo across his chest and admitted that his father had immigrated illegally. (Velasquez has since beensentenced to prisonfor issues unrelated to immigration.) After opposing the idea of female fighters for many years, White threw open the octagon door to Ronda Rousey in a 2013 bout against Liz Carmouche, who was openly gay. White strongly supported Carmouche and evengave an impassioned pleato legalize gay marriage wherever it wasn’t already recognized – a position he stated wellbeforea series of landmark US supreme court decisions upheld that right. Four years later, UFC fighter Jessica Andradeproposed to her girlfriendin her postfight interview in the octagon. While the UFC sold Pride Month gear and gave proceeds to an LGBTQIA+ organization in Nevada, outspoken Trump supporter Colby Covington emerged as one of the sport’s biggest villains.Donald Trump’s UFC stunt is more than a circus. It’s authoritarian theatre | Karim ZidanRead moreStill, the UFC’s primary demographic of young adult menproved to be a decisive forcefor Trump’s return to the presidency. This group overlaps significantly with the audience for UFC commentator Joe Rogan’s popular podcast, and Rogan – who felt ostracized by the left after touting scientifically unsound Covid treatments – endorsed Trump last year.But that was November. Fast forward to this summer, andthis demographichas veered sharplyagainst Trump. Rogan himself has broken with the president overtariffs,deportationsand theEpstein files. Last month, Rogan told podcast guest James Talarico, a Texas Democrat, that he should run for the White House. There’s a case to be made that if the Kamala Harris campaign had managed to get her on Rogan’s podcast last fall, we would have a different president today.Such changes shouldn’t be a surprise. Rogan himself is always on the lookout for new ideas – if anything, he’s a littletooreceptive to some schools of thought and doesn’t push back or check facts. While older Americans are prone to adopting a party and sticking with it come hell or high water, Gen Z isfiercely independent politically. They’re also more diverse than previous generations, more likely to benon-white,LGBTQ+or any other group that may feel aggrieved by Trump’s actions since reclaiming the presidency. Younger generations are also much morereceptive to socialismthan prior ones – after all, young men made enough of a fuss over Bernie Sanders to warrant the term “Bernie Bros.”So Maga’s place in “bro culture” – and those who are MMA fans – is by no means secure. And one day, Donald Trump will be out of office. We’ve already seen that US conservatives are eager to abandon one trend for another. Today’s Maga supporters had a decidedly different message when the Tea Party reigned supreme. Two decades after calling Democrats “traitors” for opposing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, they excommunicated the entire Bush family.Trump’s popularity may well be on the slide too. His approval ratinghas tanked, and his mutable responses to the Jeffrey Epstein saga havefractured his base. The UFC may well be losing as many fans as its attracts by aligning itself with Trump.The UFC, meanwhile, is still a strong brand but perhaps not the hot property it was a few years ago. Last week’sDisney earnings reportmade a brief reference to “lower Ultimate Fighting Championship pay-per-view fees due to lower average buys per event.” The fight game tends to be cyclical, driven by big personalities like Rousey, Jon Jones and Conor McGregor, all of whom have either left the sport or gone through a prolonged period of inactivity. It’s tough to imagine current light heavyweight champion Magomed Ankalaev reaching the level of fame of Forrest Griffin, Rampage Jackson or Chuck Liddell. While we can’t really quantify the impact of the Trump lovefest on the UFC’s popularity, the organization clearly can’t afford to alienate the60% or so of the population that disapprovesof Trump’s presidency thus far.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some fight cards will be on network TV, and others will be free to subscribers of their streaming partner.That streaming partner, though, is Paramount, which has also drawn the ire of many US viewers through a series of moves that appear to be a capitulation to the president’s desire to control the media. First, Paramountsettled a lawsuitover the editing of a Kamala Harris interview, a lawsuit deemed by many legal scholars as rather simple for Paramount to win, at the same time that the media conglomerate sought government approval for a merger. Second, after TV host Stephen Colbert criticized his parent company for settling the suit, Paramount announced that his show willend in 2026, ostensibly for financial reasons even though it is thehighest-rated late-night show. (Fox News Channel claims its show Gutfeld! has higher ratings, but it airs earlier than the traditional late-night window that starts at 11.30pm Eastern time.)Still, the decision to move away from the pay-per-view model can only be seen as a sign that the UFC feels the need to make its big tent a bit bigger as it faces the difficult challenge of keeping US fans interested in a sport in which American athletes are far from dominant. Typically,US sportsbroadcasters gravitate to events in which US athletes are faring well, which is why Olympic coverage focuses far more attention on swimming and snowboarding than, say, table tennis or biathlon.White and Trump were always an odd match. Trump was involved with Affliction, a rival MMA organization of the late 2000s that White fought with the venom of the Trump administration’s attacks on Harvard and the media. Trump has ridiculed veterans, dating back to when he said he didn’t consider John McCain a war hero because he likes “people who weren’t captured’ and continuing with Ice arrests of veterans in his second term and a recent awkward moment in which he turned attention to himself at a ceremony honoring Purple Heart recipients; White and the UFC are staunch supporters of the Wounded Warrior Project and other veterans’ groups. White is an affable philanthropist; Trump used fundsfrom his own foundationon a portrait of himself andhis presidential campaign.We probably won’t see White publicly repudiate Trump, a move that wouldn’t sit well with a sizable portion of UFC’s audience. But over the years, White has shrewdly expanded the UFC fanbase, and he would dearly love for his sport to be the biggest in the world. White has already pronounced that his involvement with politics ends with Trump,telling The New Yorkerlast year that: “I’m never fucking doing this again. I want nothing to do with this shit. It’s gross. It’s disgusting. I want nothing to do with politics.”White has changed his mind about many things over the years. He brought in Kimbo Slice not long after denigrating his fighting skills. He brought women into the cage. But those moves were driven by popular uprisings, and White is almost always willing to give fans what they want. While much of the country watches in horror as Medicaid is slashed, Gaza’s suffering gets worse by the week, the economy teeters on the brink, and the White House is in crisis mode trying to deflect from the Epstein case, the clamor to make White reassert his position at Trump’s side will surely be muted.Explore more on these topicsUFCMMAUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Molly Darlington/Getty ImagesRuben Amorim has to turn the ailing club around this season, after £200m on a new forward line, or he could be the next to pay the priceByWill UnwinTue 12 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 12.11 EDTShareGuardian writers’ predicted position:9th (NB: this is not necessarily Will Unwin’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Last season’s position:15thProspectsManchester United kitsThe big hope is thatManchester United hit rock bottomlast season and things cannot get any worse. They are in effect starting again because ending up 15th in the Premier League resulted in many executives, fans and players waking up in a cold sweat. Expectations within the fanbase are impressively low, not knowing what to expect from a team that stumbled through an entire campaign.There is no European distraction for Ruben Amorim, allowing him plenty of time on the training ground to get his ideas across. When the Portuguese head coachsucceeded Erik ten Hag last November, his role was more firefighter than problem solver. He was allowed to evaluate the squad quickly and made his decision on who were and were not up for the battle that the club found themselves in. Those players have either left or are in the process of doing so, leaving behind those who possess the character, if not the technical expertise, that Amorim thinks can benefit his plans.Matheus CunhaandBryan Mbeumohave arrived in the hope they will ignite an underperforming team and club. United scored a pitiful 44 goals in 38 Premier League games, causing much embarrassment. The pair have the capabilities to create and score goals, skills that were lacking among the players Amorim inherited. After those deals were completed for a combined £130m, the search for a competent No 9 eventually concluded withBenjamin Sesko joining from RB Leipzigfor £73.3m to fill the void, leaving plenty of pressure on the new front three.Winning only seven home games out of 19 last time around was a stain on the club. Amorim will need to ensure his solutions work as they cannot be repeated. Arsenal visit on the opening weekend; the display and the result will provide an indication as to whether things will be different this time around.How Manchester United finished in the past five seasonsThe managerArriving mid-season is always difficult for a head coach, especially when his ideas did not align with what was available within the squad, but Amorim was insistent on playing 3-4-3 regardless. He was given a relatively free ride because what had gone before was so utterly awful, but a 15th-placed finish anda meek Europa League final loss to Tottenhamwere clear indicators of the rebuild required. Ideally, Amorim would have carried out a complete overhaul of the squad but finances have dictated otherwise. If things do not start well, he may need to alter his ideals and become more pragmatic, or he may become the latest coach to fail to turn the ship around.Off-field pictureAfter aplethora of redundancies and constant cost-cutting measures, United are aiming to return to stable ground soon but these actions do little for the morale of the employees who have stayed. Many more long-serving staff left in the final weeks of last season and over the summer, pleased to get out of the club. A lack of European football will irritate the accountants at Old Trafford but Sir Jim Ratcliffe will hope the promise of a new stadium will appease fans. A lot are angry over an increase in ticket prices and some being forced to move seats, creating an uneasy atmosphere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Brazilian is exactly the sort of player Amorim wanted as one of his No 10s and he has shown at Wolves what he is capable of. He likes the ball at his feet and can do amazing things when he is given the freedom to do so. The Brazilian is a natural talent, a street footballer who has matured into a Premier League player, but one man does not make a team. Histemperament has come into question, too, after two suspensions following losses of composure last season, but United need some fire after looking meek for far too long.View image in fullscreenMatheus Cunha gave Manchester United fans an taste of his attacking flair in a friendly with Fiorentina at Old Trafford.Photograph: Ash Donelon/Manchester United/Getty ImagesStepping upRasmus Højlund really does try extremely hardbut does not look up to the job and his scoring record (26 goals in 95 games) reflects that, leaving opportunities for Chido Obi to be Sesko’s support act. Amorim offered Obi opportunities late in the season to come off the bench to try to bring greater energy to the forward line. Obi arrived from Arsenal a year ago, a sign of intent that the club want to bring in high-potential players as part of a long-term strategy. He scored 14 goals across 23 matches in various age groups and will be eager to build on that.A big season for …It is quite difficult to pick one individual considering almost no one impressed throughout last season, at least on a consistent basis. Kobbie Mainoo never fitted into what Amorim had planned and was moved around or sat on the bench, while the head coach insistedthe England midfielder had plenty to improve onand needed not to listen to the hype. Amorim does not think he can play regularly in the defensive role he was utilised in under Ten Hag, requiring someone with greater mobility in the position, so he will need to decide if he can adapt or he may need to depart.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26Manchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She put together a brilliant performance against Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of the Cincinnati Open on Monday,narrowly losing 7-6 (3), 4-6, 7-6 (5)after three hours and nine minutes.Her impressive level was a reflection of the significant progress she has made in a positive summer on the North American hard courts.Monica Seles adapting to ‘new normal’ after being diagnosed with neuromuscular diseaseRead more“This is my first year on tour playing most of the calendar,” she said. “I had a tough start to the year and it was very difficult to change that. But in the last few months I’ve been building and the level has been increasing. The players I’m playing and losing to, they’re all top players so that gives me confidence.”That confidence marks a significant contrast to Raducanu’s inconsistent presence on tour last year because of injuries and training blocks scheduled during the season. The 22-year-old did not compete for four weeks last year in the lead-up to the US Open, where shelost in the first round against Sofia Kenin.“I went home and came back and it was a really difficult time in New York,” she said. “Since I won the tournament, it’s not been easy for me there. But this year I feel different, I’m a lot calmer behind the court.“On the court, I take more confidence in the big moments. I’ve been playing those big points pretty well for the most part so I’m looking forward to having some time to practise, improve and then get ready to play there.”Since becoming the first player to win a grand slam title from the qualifying tournament at the US Open, Raducanu has not won a match in New York. Zheng Qinwen and Paula Badosa have withdrawn from the tournament with injury, meaning Raducanu’s live ranking of No 34 would be enough for a seeding. But numerous players could still overtake her at the Cincinnati Open. Either way, her positive progress and form mean that few players would be keen to face her early in New York.Sabalenka has stressed that she believes Raducanu is on the right path towards returning to the top 10: “Every tournament, I feel like she’s improving and getting better, and she definitely gonna get back into the top 10,” she said. “She’s moving well, she’s a smart player. She’s serving well, even though sometimes you can see where she’s going. But the speed, the spin is very difficult to adjust to. She’s basically doing everything [well].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This also applies to those who believe the occasional away win is necessary if the event is to remain within the realms of serious sporting contest. The European class of 2025 is now very close to replicating the onethat won in Rome in 2023,but with one quirk; Rasmus Højgaard replacing his twin brother, Nicolai. What the United States would give for such a settled scenario.Should Donald be so minded, he can keep change to an absolute minimum. Recreating a winning environment becomes so much easier when the characters involved are the same. When Europe slumped tocomprehensive defeat at Whistling Straitsfour years ago, seven of the 12-man team were sampling an American Ryder Cup for the first time. At Hazeltine, in 2016, half of Darren Clarke’s European contingent were debutants.The US again won with ease.Justin Rose wins nail-biting playoff against JJ Spaun to claim FedEx Cup titleRead moreTommy Fleetwood suffered heartache in Memphison Sunday. There was the consolation of qualification for Bethpage at the end of September. Fleetwood has joined Rory McIlroy and a reinvigorated Justin Rose as guaranteed to be in the team. Robert MacIntyre and Tyrrell Hatton are sure to follow. Shane Lowry may knock Sepp Straka out of the six automatic berths – the Austrian has withdrawn from this week’s PGA Tour stop in Maryland for family reasons – but both will be in New York.Below Straka and Lowry in the rankings come Rasmus Højgaard, Ludvig Åberg, Viktor Hovland, Matt Wallace and Matt Fitzpatrick. The rogue element for one of those inside the top dozen on the European points table is that Donald is sure to turn to Jon Rahm, whose move to the LIV Tour has distorted his place in the world rankings and automatic qualifying potential. Rahm posted two top-10 finishes in this year’s majors and earned three points for Europe in Rome.There is a reason the legal challenge from Rahm and Hatton towards theEuropean TourGroup for fines issued for playing on LIV has been kicked down the road until after the Ryder Cup – Donald wants both on his team.Long before theRyder Cupat Gleneagles in 2014, Paul McGinley sensed Victor Dubuisson would be in European colours. The Frenchman was a maverick, an outlier. McGinley quietly built a relationship between Dubuisson and the man who would become his Ryder Cup partner, Graeme McDowell. The assimilation process was successful, but lengthy. Donald has no such problems.View image in fullscreenRasmus Højgaard is in line to replace his twin brother, Nicolai, in Europe’s Ryder Cup team.Photograph: Andrew Redington/Getty ImagesThere is, however, scope for at least a modicum of late drama. It seems logical to assume that if European qualifying stopped now, Rahm would take the place of Wallace, who sits 11th. Wallace will have a final opportunity to give Donald food for thought at next week’s British Masters. Should Wallace, who has spoken candidly about the pain of missing out on the Ryder Cup in 2018, prevail or even go close at the Belfry it would make others vulnerable.Wallace tied for third when the US PGA Championship stopped at Bethpage in 2019. As a rookie, Wallace would have to give Donald undeniable cause to pick him. Looking at the names in the frame, that appears a simple case of making himself a better option than Højgaard. The big-hitting Dane enjoyed a wonderful end to 2024, but has not properly built on that position of strength. This week’s DP World Tour event in Denmark feels big for the twin.Fitzpatrick, doubtless aware of Wallace’s potential to surge, has the British Masters on his schedule, as has Højgaard. Fitzpatrick, 12th in the standings,is a major championand previous top 10 in the world player who lost his way spectacularly in the early part of this year. Fitzpatrick’s rebound has been impressive, recently involving a batch of high finishes on either side of the Atlantic, including a share of fourth at the Open. Fitzpatrick is still involved in the FedEx Cup playoffs and will tee up this week at Caves Valley.For Donald, these are all relatively trivial issues. Every player he needs in the Bethpage picture is already there. In McIlroy, he also has an on-course leader with a stated aim of assisting Europe to a win in the US long before he clinched a career grand slam. Such a hugely incentivised McIlroy is a dangerous McIlroy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As if the Sweden striker’s decision to skip the club’s tour of Singapore and South Korea while trying to force a move to Liverpool was not bad enough, a succession of transfer targets have turned Newcastle down.Hugo Ekitiké, Bryan Mbeumo, João Pedro, James Trafford andBenjamin Sesko optedto move to Liverpool, London or Manchester as the majority Saudi Arabian-owned club operated without a sporting director and chief executive. The good news is that Eddie Howe is an excellent coach and possesses plenty of high-calibre players, Sandro Tonali, Bruno Guimarães, Anthony Elanga, Joelinton and Anthony Gordon foremost among them. Throw in the arrivals of Anthony Elanga, Aaron Ramsdale and, almost certainly,Malick Thiawand last season’s starting XI has been fortified in goal, central defence and on the right wing.The need for a couple of strikers and, above all, a resolution to Isak’s flirtation with Liverpool remains pressing. Howe’s admission that he “wants players that really want to play for this football club” suggests the manager has had enough of Isak but much depends on the expected impending financial haggling between Newcastle’s owners and the Anfield board. Meanwhile Newcastle have failed to win a pre-season fixture. “It’s been achallenging summer,” Howe reflected. “But any season can go one of two ways. Things are never as good or as bad as you think. At the moment I’m very neutral. I believe that from tough moments you can build something even more special than you had before.”How Newcastle finished in the past five seasonsThe managerAny concerns that Howe could flounder away from his south-coast comfort zone have been well and truly banished during the near four years the former Bournemouth manager has spent on Tyneside. The workaholic 47-year-old is an outstanding coach who, in the course of leading Newcastle into the Champions League for the second time in three seasons and choreographing the Carabao Cup triumph, has improved a series of players beyond measure. Joelinton’s startling metamorphosis from struggling centre-forward to gamechanging midfielder is testament to Howe’s talents. Although an excellent, highly articulate communicator, Newcastle’s piano-playing manager does not dispense trust easily and, publicly at least, is a master of circumspection.Off-field pictureDespite the gargantuan wealth of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Newcastle’s relatively skinny commercial revenue streams dictate their spending is restricted by Premier League profitability and sustainability rules. Fans, and some players, are frustrated by the Saudis’ failure to deliver a new training ground, and a decision as to whether to revamp St James’ Park or build a new stadium keeps being postponed. It does not help that the club have spent the past 11 months seeking a new chief executive after the outgoing Darren Eales’s blood cancer diagnosis and have been without a sporting director this summer in the wake of Paul Mitchell’s abrupt exit in June, after less than a year in the job. Since the ousting of the former minority owner Amanda Staveley and her husband, Mehrdad Ghodoussi, last summer the lack of an Arabist and/or an executive conversant with Saudi business culture in Newcastle’s UK hierarchy has created an apparent disconnect.Last season’s resultsStar signingThe £55m signing of Elanga from Nottingham Forest ends Howe’s long-running quest for a new right winger. “I want to showcase my talent,” says the rapid-dribbling 23-year-old Sweden international. “I’m pacey and direct. I can play on either side, I can play as a striker. I can use both feet. I’ve got lots of weapons. I know the gaffer and staff here can take my game to another level. What we want to achieve, how we want to play, it’s perfect. What we’re building here is unique and special. As soon as I knew about Newcastle’s interest it was a no brainer.” Howe has long been impressed by a player whose solitary work on his left foot during lockdown has left Elanga two-footed. “I’ve got a saying where I’m precise, not rushed,” says the former Manchester United winger. “It’s a French saying, precis pas précipité, something I go by a lot. In my life, I’ve never rushed anything.”View image in fullscreenAnthony Elanga has said it was a ‘no brainer’ to join Newcastle this summer.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAStepping upLewis Miley is 19 but looks very much the complete midfielder and holds two England Under-21 caps. After breaking into Newcastle’s first team during the 2023-24 campaign, a 6ft 2in player with an eye for goal, equally at home in a defensive or attacking midfield role, was restricted to 14 appearances last season. If a back injury was partly responsible, the best youngster to emerge from Newcastle’s academy for a very long time faced stiff completion from Tonali, Guimarães and Joelinton for a starting spot in Howe’s midfield trinity. The demands of a Champions League campaign should create more opportunities this term when Miley can show he is capable of providing real competition for Guimarães and co.A big season for …At 27 Aaron Ramsdale has suffered three relegations from the Premier League (with Bournemouth, Sheffield United and Southampton), been bought by Arsenal for £30m and won five England caps. He joins on loan from Southampton and will compete with Nick Pope for a starting place. Howe, Ramsdale’s old Bournemouth manager, admires his footwork and regards his former protege as the sort of goalkeeper needed to advance Newcastle’s stylistic evolution. But is Ramsdale really a better all-round keeper than Pope? Can he recapture the form that once made him Arsenal’s first choice? And can he assuage Newcastle’s disappointment at seeing Manchester City hijack their move for Trafford, the gifted former Burnley goalkeeper?Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26Newcastle UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Recent entrants to the Football League, this meeting with Ipswich was just their secondCarabao Cupcontest – now they have their first victory, delivered on penalties against a side who were in the top tier three months ago.After Ben Johnson cancelled out Deji Elerewe’s first-half opener forBromley, the game went to sudden death and the night belonged to Sam Long. He saved Ipswich’s first penalty, low to his right off George Hirst, and was required for another, denying Ali Al-Hamadi, once a Bromley player. Marcus Ifill slotted in for the final blow. It proved to be a memorable moment for a club not short of them in recent years.Champions League qualifying and Carabao Cup first round: football – as it happenedRead more“Show them a level of respect but don’t roll over and just say: ‘Come in here and nick all our crown jewels and go home with the win,’” the Bromley manager, Andy Woodman, said in explaining his pre‑game instructions.“Let’s go out there and give an account of ourselves. I’m probably not a household name as a manager, but my team and me, we work our socks off to cover everything. And my team represents me very well.”This game brought together two managers who are 15 years and two divisions apart but with similar stories to tell. Kieran McKenna and Woodman joined their respective clubs in 2021, leaving behind the luxury of the Premier League; McKenna departed Manchester United’s staff, Woodman was head of goalkeeping at Arsenal.Both have packed plenty of history in the past four years, McKenna most notably with back-to-back promotions; Woodman with his side’s ascension into the Football League last year, a first for the club founded in 1892. The 3G pitch at Hayes Lane was subsequently ripped out and replaced by grass to fulfil league requirements, symbolic for a club wanting more.View image in fullscreenBen Johnson equalised for Ipswich after Bromley’s Deji Elerewe had opened the scoring in the first half.Photograph: John Walton/PABromley finished last season four points off the League Two playoffs and reached the third round of the FA Cup for the first time, even taking the lead at St James’ Park before Newcastle won 3-1. Ipswich, days after anintense Championship opener with Birmingham, were well positioned for a serious scare.Bromley’s special occasion was not to get in the way of rotation, both sides much changed from their last outings. Michael Cheek, the leading goalscorer in League Two last season, was left on the home bench. McKenna handed a first Ipswich start to Ashley Young, older than his manager but still up for a trek down the right. He eased through the first half as Ipswich dominated possession but failed to create.Jack Clarke was lively when cutting in from the left; the overlapping Leif Davis enjoyed the space created and launched his cutbacks. But they could not get past the Bromley centre-half Omar Sowunmi, towering over Al-Hamadi and in control at the back. Fittingly, Sowunmi was key at the other end, too. Leaping high from a corner just before half-time, he headed into the middle for Elerewe, who glanced in to prompt the roar.Quick GuideChampionship outfits stunned in Carabao CupShowDoncastercontinued their dream start to the season as they stunned Championship sideMiddlesbrough4-0 at the Riverside to book their place in the Carabao Cup second round.Rovers took the lead in the 11th minute when Boro were made to pay for cheaply conceding possession in their own half. Jordan Gibson found Billy Sharp in the box and the experienced striker teed up Ben Close, whose shot deflected in off defender George McCormick.Doncaster doubled their lead in the 23rd minute thanks to another heavy deflection, with Boro defender Alfie Jones diverting Damola Ajayi’s shot from inside the box beyond goalkeeper Tom Glover. Robbie Gotts fired in the third from outside the box six minutes from time, before Tom Nixon curled in the fourth deep in stoppage time.Bradfordscored twice in the first four minutes to shockBlackburn2-1 in the tie at Ewood Park. Graham Alexander’s newly promoted Bradford stunned their Championship hosts  with a lightning start, as Ibou Touray slammed in a sumptuous volley with barely 90 seconds gone.It got worse two minutes later when Blackburn’s debutant goalkeeper Nick Michalski lost control of the ball outside the area under pressure, leaving Will Swan with an empty net.Michalski had to be alert to deny Swan a second before Rovers grabbed a lifeline on the stroke of half-time when Dion De Neve controlled a long throw and rifled in expertly from six yards but Bradford held on.Wrexham, meanwhile, staged a dramatic late comeback to snatch a place in the second round on penalties after a 3-3 draw withHull. Veteran striker Ollie Palmer put doubt over his future aside with two headed goals in stoppage time to take a pulsating encounter at the Racecourse to a shootout.The hosts prevailed 5-3 on penalties after Joel Ndala hit the crossbar for Hull. Wrexham had led after 31 minutes through Elliot Lee but looked like going out as Hull hit back through Oli McBurnie, Ndala and Matt Crooks.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There was more joy for Bromley supporters after the break as Cheek came on under lights, ready to hassle up top. Ipswich, nonetheless, went level through a half-time change of their own. Chiedozie Ogbene thundered down the right wing before Conor Chaplin seized on the cross, his close-range volley tipped on to the crossbar by Long. But Johnson’s arrival into the box was perfectly timed, the rebound slotted in.Bromley came close when Marcus Dinanga was denied inside the area by Christian Walton as the game turned more frenetic around the hour. But the net refused to bustle, with Al-Hamadi and Ifill going close in the dying exchanges. The latter had his moment not long after.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupBromleyIpswich Townmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

TheLigue 1winners appear to have signed his replacement in the highly-rated Lucas Chevalier, who joined from Lille last week. Luis Enrique emphasised that the decision to leave Donnarumma behind, and seemingly end his PSG career, had been a technical one.Tottenham leave Bissouma out of Super Cup squad due to persistent latenessRead more“These are always difficult decisions to make,” he said. “I can definitely talk about Gigi, because he’s one of the best players in his position, without a doubt. He’s even better as a person. We’re looking for a goalkeeping profile that is different to Donnarumma. It’s always difficult to make the decision in these kinds of situations. My decision is a decision that’s been taken, it’s been supported by my club.”Donnarumma offered his own perspective in an Instagram post that suggested his manager’s view was not shared. “Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team’s success,” a section of it read. “I am disappointed and disheartened. I hope I have the opportunity to look the fans at the Parc des Princes in the eyes one more time and say goodbye as it should be done. If that doesn’t happen, I want you to know that your support and affection mean the world to me, and I will never forget it.”Even though Luis Enrique appeared to be implying that Donnarumma’s ability on the ball required improving on, a clamour for the 26-year-old’s services is expected in England and beyond. He has made 74 appearances for his country, winning Euro 2020, and has won four Ligue 1 titles since joining PSG from AC Milan in 2021. Premier League clubs will be on high alert for a player who has entered the last year of his contract and could be available at a cut price.“If we are champions of Europe, we owe him a lot,” said the PSG captain, Marquinhos. “He is part of this history and always will be. We’re so proud of what he’s done, we thank him from the bottom of our hearts. We don’t know if he’s staying or going yet and if he’s staying we welcome him with open arms.”View image in fullscreenIllia Zabarnyi joins PSG after making 86 appearances for Bournemouth.Photograph: PSGPSG hope to back up their thrashing of Inter in Munich by defeating the Europa League winners Tottenham.

He said: “My two favourite English players ever are Wayne Rooney and Paul Gascoigne and I know they both wore No 18 here.“So, as soon as I knew this deal was close, I had a look and No 18 was free, so that was perfect for me and it was the only number I was going to take from that point.

Frank has wasted no time pressing home his standards and explained he had opted against selecting Bissouma, the Mali international midfielder, because of multiple lapses.Spurs open Eze talks as they try to beat Arsenal to Palace attackerRead more“Bissouma has not travelled with the team because of disciplinary reasons,” Frank said after their arrival in north-east Italy. “He has been late several times and the latest time was one too many. With everything you need to give your players a lot of love but also have demands and there also need to be consequences. This time there was a consequence for that.”Frank suggested the punishment applied only to this fixture and that he would “follow up when I come home”. The infraction will heighten doubts over Bissouma’s future. He has entered the final year of his contract with little sign a new deal is imminent and his three seasons at Tottenham have been decidedly mixed. The club suspended him from the trip to Leicester last August after he was recordedinhaling nitrous oxideand their former manager Ange Postecoglou said he “sometimes lets the game drift by him” after the defeat by Fulham in March.Although the Super Cup sits below Uefa’s three other major club competitions in terms of prestige, Frank played up the importance of following theirEuropa League winby toppling the Champions League holders. “It’s a massive game,” he said. “A great challenge and an even bigger opportunity. That’s how my brain works, I see opportunities instead of pressure. So for me, massive opportunity. We will definitely embrace it and we will do everything.”Spurs’s squad for the coming Premier League season remains incomplete and they are trying to signEberechi Eze from Crystal Palaceunder the noses of Arsenal. Frank did not take the bait when asked about any deal for the forward. “There are a lot of good players out there, there are also a few from the PSG team, but I don’t think we can buy them right now.” he said. “In general, players in and players out, I’m only speaking if something is done or not done.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, with Palace taking a financial hit afterlosing their Europa League placeand Guéhi in the final year of his contract, the Premier League champions hope to secure a deal for £35m. Negotiations are understood to have progressed smoothly on Tuesday.Liverpool are also interested in the 18-year-old Leoni, who impressed in the second half of last season forParmaand is regarded as one of the best defensive prospects in Europe. The club would like to add him and Guéhi to their squad.Leoni is also wanted by Inter.

It may take more than £100m to sign a player rated as one of the best emerging talents in world football.Any United bid for Baleba is understood to be dependent on players being moved on, with Chelsea still in talks over a deal for Alejandro Garnacho and Milan interested in Rasmus Højlund.

West Ham are understood to have offered an initial £28m plus £2m in add-ons. They believe Southampton, one of the favourites for promotion from the Championship, want too much for a player with one season of Premier League football behind him.West Ham are prepared to explore alternative targets. They like Jacob Ramsey, but face a battle to convince the Aston Villa midfielder to join them. Newcastle have been linked with Ramsey. West Ham are also tracking Lille’s Ngal’ayel Mukau.Graham Potter wants more energy, dynamism and creativity in midfield. He regards Fernandes as a No 8 and is also keen to bring in a No 6, but West Ham will need sales if they are to sign more than one midfielder. They are struggling to find buyers for Edson Álvarez, Guido Rodríguez and Tomas Soucek. Álvarez is available for £20m, but is on big wages.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowManchester UnitedBrighton & Hove AlbionLiverpoolParmaWest Ham UnitedSouthamptonnewsShareReuse this content"

He took a week off from practice and holidayed in El Puerto de Santa Maria, in southern Spain, before two weeks training at home in El Palmar, Murcia.“When I’m off, I’m off,” he said. “I don’t step in the gym at all. A lot of times if we go for a trip, sometimes my friends go to the gym. The first week that I had off I just told them: ‘I’m gonna join you for a little run.’ But then I woke up and I said: ‘Go, and I’m going to keep sleeping.’”Medjedovic presented a genuine challenge for Alcaraz. A winner at the Next Gen ATP Finals in 2023, two years after Alcaraz’s victory there, the 22-year-old is armed with a big serve and an enormous forehand. However, his footwork, conditioning and intensity are all lacking at the highest level. With the exception of a brief blip in the second set, where he momentarily lost his serve, Alcaraz played a solid match and he continually exposed Medjedovic’s movement as he marched into the fourth round.“I know he’s a really powerful player,” Alcaraz said after his 50th victory of the year, which gives him four consecutive seasons with 50-plus wins. That hasn’t happened on the ATP Tour since Novak Djokovic accomplished the feat in 2013-16. “His shots are incredibly hard to return. He has a big serve also. I know he doesn’t like to run too much from side to side, so my plan was to make him run as much as I could.“It was difficult because his ball flies and it comes really fast, but I’m just glad that I did it most of the time, tried to defend in a good way. I’m just really happy to get the win.”Alcaraz will next face Luca Nardi, a lucky loser, after the 16th seed Jakub Mensik became the latest player to suffer in the heat, retiring from his third-round match against Nardi when trailing 6-2, 2-1. In the women’s draw Coco Gauff advanced to the fourth round after a walkover against Dayana Yastremska, the 32nd seed, who withdrew on Tuesday due to illness.Explore more on these topicsCarlos AlcarazTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The striker is trying to secure a move toLiverpooland it emerged on Tuesday that new tenants are being sought.Removal vans have been sighted at Isak’s Ponteland home, which is understood to have been put on the market some weeks ago.

The player’s victim impact statement, read in court this year, said the attack had left him “with a sense of unease and I fear it could reoccur”.Isak signalled his determination to force a transfer by not going on Newcastle’s pre-season tour to Singapore and South Korea last month and he has been ordered by Eddie Howe to train alone. The manager also banned the Sweden internationalfrom a training‑ground barbecuelast week.Liverpool have had a £110m bid for Isak turned down but remain determined to sign the 25‑year‑old striker, who has scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances. He is valued by Newcastle at £150m but it would be a surprise if a compromise were not found for the move to go ahead.That is contingent on Newcastle buying at least one striker. A deal for the Brentford centre-forward Yoane Wissa is expected to be concluded this week and Porto’s Samu Aghehowa is among other targets.Isak was handed a shirt number on Tuesday when Newcastle published their squad list, retaining the No 14 he has worn since he joined. Howe has no intention of using Isak on Saturday in the opening game at Aston Villa – the manager has said he only wants players who “really want to play for this football club”.Newcastle, meanwhile, completed the signing of the Milan defender Malick Thiaw on Tuesday night. The Germany international joins Howe’s side for a reported £34.6m, including add‑ons.

This will mostly be on Sundays as a result of rescheduling for Thursday European fixtures. With one main match and three smaller screens lined up alongside, one commentary team will move across all the games. Each of the matches will also be broadcast individually on different channels. The format may also be used for coverage of the Women’s Super League this season.Sky’s director of football, Gary Hughes, said the service would offer viewers more choice. “The question for us has been how can we enhance what we’ve got? And how can we utilise the new rights?” he said. “Having four simultaneous games, we might even have five on some midweeks, means it’s just the best way we can offer the best use of the assets that we’ve got. There could be some chaos to it, but that’s the beauty of having all those games at once.”The broadcaster also announced it had recruited Mark Chapman as a presenter for its league coverage, with Chapman joining Kelly Cates in working for both Sky and the BBC’s Match of the Day this season. There will also be a new analysis show on Sunday nights, presented by Jamie Carragher, and a wide-ranging reboot ofSky SportsNews which will bring the return of the formerly cancelled shows Goals on Sunday and the Sunday Supplement. Roman Kemp will host a show on the channel on Friday evenings.Sky will show a minimum of 215 live Premier League matches this season as it enters the first of a new four-year £6.7bn rights deal.

Neuroscientist Chris Nowinski on what happens nextTue 12 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 10.12 EDTShareShortly after news broke that a shooter had breached the New York City skyscraper where the NFL is headquartered andkilled four peoplebefore turning the gun on himself, Chris Nowinski was called to duty.A former Harvard football player and professional wrestler turned neuroscientist, Nowinski helped establish theUnite Brain Bankat Boston University. It is the world’s largest repository of brain samples dedicated to the study ofCTE– or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a progressive neurodegenerative disease linked to repetitive hits to the head and concussions. Some 1,600 brains have been examined there, with Nowinski helping to facilitate donations.In his suicidenote, 27-year-old Shane Tamura of Las Vegas asked for his brain to be studied for CTE, which can only be diagnosed posthumously. Tamura was a former high school football player, and he claimed the sport gave him the incurable brain injury.Nowinski is following the case closely, preparing for the possibility that BU might acquire Tamura’s brain. While he and the general public awaits the results of theNew Yorkmedical examiners office’s criminal autopsy (the office declined to provide a timeline), he spoke with the Guardian about how the Brain Bank procures former athletes’ brains and what the NFL did to make the uproar around CTE go away.Brain injuries and legal battles: the NFL’s persistent problem with CTERead moreWhat was your initial reaction to the news?It was very troubling to learn about his suicide note. He clearly understood some aspects of the concussion and CTE discussion. But with what he did, he was not of sound mind, so you wonder if this was something that he latched on to as part of his psychosis.How would you categorize Tamura’s case? At least from a violence standpoint, it feels like it belongs on the same spectrum withPhillip AdamsandAaron Hernandez– both former NFL players who committed murder before killing themselves.We’ve seen this enough over the years to know there are three categories: there’s a chance that there’s no pathological brain damage, that this has nothing to do with any history of playing football. There’s a chance this has nothing to do with CTE, but he did take enough hits that he suffered concussions or subclinical traumatic brain injury that contributed to his symptoms, and that those symptoms contributed to his actions. And then there’s the chance that he had CTE – and thenthatsort of splits into, did he have enough CTE where we might think it contributed to his actions or not?View image in fullscreenAnn McKee, director of Boston University’s CTE center, addresses an audience on the school’s campus on 9 November 2017 about the study of Aaron Hernandez’s brain.Photograph: Steven Senne/APYou helped establish the Unite Brain Bank at Boston University, where the bulk of CTE research is conducted. What does the process of pursuing a brain for science look like?We don’t usually go into specifics, but what I can tell you is that my job is to track down cases that are of public interest – and this case certainly qualifies.In a case like this where there’s an ongoing investigation, the brain is basically under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner. It’s their call whether or not it’s studied and whether it’s studied in-house or externally. But I also know the people involved with the New York City medical examiner’s office have a tremendous reputation and tremendous capabilities internally, so there’s no concern that [Tamura’s] brain won’t be studied.What happensto the deceased after a criminal investigation has concluded? Like in the case of Hernandez, who died in penal custody?There is a time when the investigation is over that, in theory, the brain tissue then becomes property of the family.How does one go about convincing a family to make a donation to the Brain Bank, especially in tragic situations such as Tamura’s or Hernandez’s?At this stage, after 1,600 brains, one thing our team all agrees upon is that there’s no case so important [as] to upset a family. If they’re not comfortable or on the fence, they’re never pressured. We offer it as an opportunity if they want to.What can the process of donating a brain look like for most families?Most will call the 24-hour Boston University CTE center hotline. The person who responds to the call usually has a network of medical experts across the country who are essentially on call for brain retrievals. They coordinate when the brain retrieval will occur – could be at a hospital or a funeral home. The expert procures the brain and then either a courier is hired to fly it to Boston or it will be [preserved] for weeks to harden and then transferred to Boston.It is true that a larger proportion of men with CTE than you would like had become violent with loved onesChris NowinskiBU says online that it’s able to make extractions while also allowing for families to have open-casket funerals. How?The person retrieving the brain goes through the back of the skull.Ten years ago, football’s CTE crisis was headline news and an inescapable controversy for theNFL. Why did the outrage recede?I’ll give you three insights: one is that when the NFL stopped denying the game caused CTE, it took some of the energy out. It stopped there being a clear bad guy in the story. Two is the sports industry has benefited from the fracturing of media. There just aren’t that many full-time investigative journalists in sports anymore. Then point three is you can’t get this issue on television anymore, and that’s primarily because the NFL has now given a game to every media platform. It’s not even a well-kept secret that anybody who carries game broadcasts is very concerned about [not calling attention to] CTE in the NFL. [Days after this interview, the NFLannouncedit had bought a 10% stake in ESPN.]I can remember there being some urgency to establish a link between CTE and violence – but all the research at the time was inconclusive. Has anything changed?I still wouldn’t say there’s been a definitive study. Frankly, it’s very difficult to answer the question of CTE and violence through Brain Bank studies, because the data it produces comes from talking to families [after the subject dies]. It is true that a larger proportion of men with CTE than you would like had become violent with loved ones. But it’s difficult to study the appearance and disappearance of the violence in part because a lot of people with CTE became violent midlife and then less so as dementia set in. So that will need to be studied longitudinally.But if you ask me: am I aware of people [who played contact sports] who are considered the nicest guys in the world suddenly in their 50s and 60s becoming violent with their loved ones? I have a lot of those stories.The NFL is quite proud of the rules changes theyhave enacted to make pro football safer – and to its credit the updates have taken a lot of hits out of the game. But what about the levels below, like college and high school? Can we point to a reduction in potential brain injuries?Firstly, the NFL had to take the brain injury risk seriously because there’s a [players] union. But that doesn’t exist in college. We did an editorial recently to accompany a study that showed basically that 80% of the NFL’s concussions are in games; in college, it’s 30% [meaning the overwhelming majority happen during practice]. The editorial laid out how the NFL set the tone 10 years ago by virtually eliminating hits in practice.View image in fullscreenDefensive lineman Kevin Henry and linebacker Earl Holmes of the Pittsburgh Steelers tackle runningback Fred Taylor of the Jacksonville Jaguars during a game at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on 22 November 1998.Photograph: George Gojkovich/Getty ImagesThe reality is I’m glad the NFL has started making some stronger changes – most recently, to kickoff procedures. No one was dying for that, but now we’re all fine with it. But the sad part is the other levels aren’t copying the NFL. Like, how is the NFL proving that it’s safer, but college and high school football aren’t eventalkingabout it? In high school, apart from two states that have severe limits, everybody else has pretty loose limits, no monitoring and no penalties. I’m having that battle on a daily basis to warn athletes, especially the ones who are old enough to understand, that they’re not being warned and their coaches are not properly educated on CTE.So for all the good things that have happened, slowly progressing the discussion, we should not expect CTE to go down. We’re still creating the same problem; we just feel better about it.Personally, it always rankles me to hear announcers complain about roughness penalties that strike them as overzealous.Then you realize safety is an afterthought to the business – that if the changes are too radical and fans turn off the TV, the hitting comes back. And I don’t have a problem with that at the NFL level. Players get half the revenue, so they can have that discussion about how safe they want it to be. But we also have to educate the fans to allow it to be safer. The one place where that’s actually happened is professional wrestling. Now that fans understand the risks, they want matches to be stopped when people have concussions.Current NFL players don’t talk about CTE because many of them don’t understand it and others know they’ll be punished if they doChris NowinskiEven now you see wrestling fans struggle to play back old matches because it’s so obvious how dazed some of those guys were in the ring.I had that discussion with a 25-year-old who works for a sports organization in the brain health space who was like, “I watched some matches from your era. What the hell were you guys doing?” So, we could educate NFL fans too to enjoy a slightly safer game. But who wants to be reminded that many of the guys they’re watching already have CTE?Given that the NYC shooting happened during NFL training camps, I was surprised that players didn’t have more to say about it.Current NFL players don’t talk about CTE because many of them don’t understand it and others know they’ll be punished if they do. I mean, let’s be honest: Jerry Jones [owner of the Dallas Cowboys] is still on the record saying he doesn’t believe that football causes CTE even though he’s losta teammate from Arkansasto it. So if you play for the Cowboys and start talking about CTE, I wouldn’t be surprised if he cut you the next day.Ten years ago there was a lot of talk about the need for a test to detect CTE in the living. Are we any closer to that?Yes. We’ve learned tau Pet scans for Alzheimer’s disease don’t work. But we have identified targets we think might make it diagnosable from blood, and we are trying two more new tau Pet tracers that people are hopeful might work for CTE.Interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Explore more on these topicsNeuroscienceNew YorkGun crimeNFLUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

This was despite reading that “chloride can be swapped with bromide, though likely for other purposes, such as cleaning”. Sodium bromide was used as a sedative in the early 20th century.‘It’s missing something’: AGI, superintelligence and a race for the futureRead moreThe article’s authors, from the University of Washington in Seattle, said the case highlighted “how the use of artificial intelligence can potentially contribute to the development of preventable adverse health outcomes”.They added that because they could not access the patient’s ChatGPT conversation log it was not possible to determine the advice the man had received.Nonetheless, when the authors consulted ChatGPT themselves about what chloride could be replaced with, the response also included bromide, did not provide a specific health warning and did not ask why the authors were seeking such information – “as we presume a medical professional would do”, they wrote.The authors warned that ChatGPT and other AI apps could ‘“generate scientific inaccuracies, lack the ability to critically discuss results, and ultimately fuel the spread of misinformation”.The companyannounced an upgrade of the chatbot last weekand claimed one of its biggest strengths was in health. It said ChatGPT – now powered by the GPT-5 model – would be better at answering health-related questions and would also be more proactive at “flagging potential concerns”, such as serious physical or mental illness.However, it emphasised that thechatbotwas not a replacement for professional help. The chatbot’s guidelines also state it is not “intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health condition”.The journal article, which was published last week before the launch of GPT-5, said the patient appeared to have used an earlier version of ChatGPT.While acknowledging that AI could be a bridge between scientists and the public, the article said the technology also carried the risk of promoting “decontextualised information” and that it was highly unlikely a medical professional would have suggested sodium bromide when a patient asked for a replacement for table salt.As a result, the authors said, doctors would need to consider the use of AI when checking where patients obtained their information.The authors said the bromism patient presented himself at a hospital and claimed his neighbour might be poisoning him. He also said he had multiple dietary restrictions. Despite being thirsty, he was noted as being paranoid about the water he was offered.He tried to escape the hospital within 24 hours of being admitted and, after being sectioned, was treated for psychosis. Once the patient stabilised, he reported having several other symptoms that indicated bromism, such as facial acne, excessive thirst and insomnia.Explore more on these topicsChatGPTChatbotsOpenAIHealthArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

My Spotify playlists are undergoing a British invasion this week. Here’s what I’m listening to:PinkPantheress,Lola YoungandEvita in London.Privileges with the presidentDonald Trump announced this week that two US chipmakers would tithe 15% of their revenue from sales in China to the US government. Paying for the license to sell to Chinese customers represents an unprecedented deal.My colleague Helen Davidsonreports from Taipei:The chipmakersNvidiaand AMD have agreed to give the US government 15% of their revenue from advanced chips sold to China in return for export licences to the key market.The arrangement will lead to Nvidia giving 15% of its revenue from Chinese sales of its H20 chips, and AMD giving 15% of revenue from Chinese sales of its MI308 chips, according to reports citing US officials.The H20 and MI308 chips were banned from sale to China in April, despite the lower-powered H20 being designed specifically to abide by restrictions introduced by the Biden administration.Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, head of the most valuable company in the world at $4.44tn, has been lobbying the White House for months to open up sales in China, where the US still prohibits sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips over national security concerns. In July, Trump relaxed some restrictions imposed by Joe Biden’s administration.The deal with Nvidia and AMD seems as much about personally appealing to Trump as it does about generating revenue for the US government. The agreement has all the trappings of Trump entering into business with the chipmakers.In a way, it’s a version of a playbook other major tech companies have been trying out as Trump is dramatically changing the international business landscape.Appleannounced a $100bn investment commitment in US manufacturing. CEO Tim Cook, who had made the journey to the White House himself, presented Trump with a glass trophy (including 24 karat gold base) designating the president a graduate of the Apple Manufacturing Academy, launched in Michigan the week prior.During his meeting with Cook, Trump said he would levy a 100% tariff on semiconductor chips, which could set both Apple and Nvidia back billions. However, the president said: “If you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge.”Both Nvidia and Apple are likely to be exempted from the tariffs. Each appears to have paid for the privilege – Apple with its domestic investment, Nvidia with its revenue-sharing agreement.OpenAI debuts GPT-5View image in fullscreenPhotograph: VCG/Getty ImagesOpenAI launched the new version of the artificial intelligence that underpinsChatGPTlast week. There are quite a few aspects of the release to consider to understand it fully – what the company is saying, where the AI race between tech giants stands, the model’s new capabilities and pitfalls, the environmental impact – so I’ve rounded up the Guardian’s coverage of GPT-5 below.OpenAI said GPT-5 has marked improved coding and writing capabilities over its predecessor. My colleague Dan Milmo reports:OpenAI has claimed to have taken a “significant step” towards artificial general intelligence (AGI) with the launch of its latest upgrade to ChatGPT, but has admitted there are still “many things” missing in its quest to create a system able to do humans’ jobs.Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, called the model a “significant step forward” to achieving the theoretical state of AGI, which the startup defines as a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work – or, in other words, can do their jobs.Read the full story on the unveiling of GPT-5:OpenAI says latest ChatGPT upgrade is big step forward but still can’t do humans’ jobsThe race towards artificial general intelligence is running hot, with tech giants pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into the technology, but like OpenAI, Google and Meta acknowledge they have not reached that goal yet. Dan Milmo and Dara Kerr report:“[It is] missing something quite important, many things quite important,” said Altman, such as the model’s inability to “continuously learn” even after its launch. In other words, these systems are impressive but they have yet to crack the autonomy that would allow them to do a full-time job.Last month, Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook parent Meta, said development of superintelligence – another theoretical state of AI where a system far exceeds human cognitive abilities – is “now in sight”. Google’s AI unit on Tuesday outlined its next step to AGI by announcing an unreleased model that trains AIs to interact with a convincing simulation of the real world.Read the full story:‘It’s missing something’: AGI, superintelligence and a race for the futureskip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It struggles with maps in a way a 10-year-old might. Per my colleague Josh Taylor:when Guardian Australia asked the latest model of ChatGPT to identify the number of Rs in Australia’s states and territories, it could identify those which did. But the AI also believed Northern Territory had just three Rs not five. When asked to produce it on a map, spelled the territory as “Northan Territor”.Read the full story:OpenAI unveils ChatGPT-5 and its hyped ‘PhD level’ intelligence struggled with basic spelling and geographyGPT-5 is a more powerful model than its predecessor, meaning it will consume more resources to answer each query. Here’s what experts told Aisha Kehoe Down:“A more complex model like GPT-5 consumes more power both during training and during inference. It’s also targeted at long thinking … I can safely say that it’s going to consume a lot more power than GPT-4,” said Rakesh Kumar, a professor at the University of Illinois, currently working on the energy consumption of computation and AI models.Given recent reports that ChatGPT handles 2.5bn requests a day, the total consumption of GPT-5 could reach the daily electricity demand of 1.5m US homes.Read the full story:OpenAI will not disclose GPT-5’s energy use. It could be higher than past modelsEnd of an era: AOL to discontinue its dial-up internet service after 30 yearsView image in fullscreenAn AOL home page in Palo Alto, California, in May 2009.Photograph: Paul Sakuma/APSurprise: AOL, formerly known as America Online, was still offering dial-up internet service in 2025. My colleagueEdward Helmore reports:The hisses, pings and screeches that introduced millions of Americans to the nascent online world are to be formally retired when AOL’s dial-up internet shuts down in late September.At its peak in the late 1990s and early 2000s, AOL had over 23 million subscribers in the US, making it the dominant internet service provider at the time.Currently, only a small fraction of US households – about 175,000 – still rely on dial-up for internet access and web browser platforms.In 2013, Pew Research found that just 3% of American households used dial-up internet. The 2025 figure represents less than 0.5% of the current population.What once seemed ubiquitous in the US and UK is now a relic and only a partially important piece of the history of the internet. Many parts of the world that are now online never experienced – perhaps endured might be the more apt word – dial-up internet. They jumped straight to broadband, wifi or the mobile internet, a phenomenon known as technological leapfrogging. If you’re feeling nostalgic for the early days of the internet, though, you can listen to the classic, grating sound of dialing into the web viaWikipedia’s page on the subject.The wider TechScapeTikTok to replace trust and safety team in Germany with AI and outsourced laborCompanies aiding Trump’s immigration crackdown see ‘extraordinary’ revenuesStaff at UK’s top AI institute complain to watchdog about its internal cultureSocial media accounts of Palestinians desperate for funds are being flagged as spam‘A million calls an hour’: Israel relying on Microsoft cloud for expansive surveillance of PalestiniansExplore more on these topicsNvidiaTechScape newsletterOpenAIAppleChatGPTDonald TrumpComputingAOLnewslettersShareReuse this content"

The village of Chandley is “small” and “complicated”, he says warmly. “Everyone’s got their own story.” The action cuts between cosy, wooden cottages and a moss-covered forest filled with folkloric creatures. We see the protagonist, a horticulturist wizard “steeped in the green and growing arts”, returning home and tending to an abundance of vegetables. Some you’ll find in your local supermarket; others are of a decidedly more magical variety.As a rural life simulation, Mandrake is odder and more beguiling than most. It possesses the same undeniable allure as classics such as Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley, inviting players to slip into the seasonal flow of crop cultivation, countryside exploration and conversations with suspiciously cheerful townsfolk. But there’s more going on here: lush, painterly visuals to start. And should you tire of tilling the soil, you might wander off the beaten path of this mythical, Brythonic-inspired land, perhaps eavesdropping on the dead or even befriending a river.View image in fullscreenCosy cultivation … Mandrake.Photograph: Failbetter GamesWeirdness is to be expected in a new release from Failbetter, the boutique UK studio behind acclaimed titles Fallen London and Sunless Sea. Set in a shared fictional universe, that narrative RPG and moody survival experience, respectively, were masterclasses in evocative prose and captivating world-building. London became “Fallen”, submerged in a darkened underworld called the Neath, newly situated on the coast of a vast, black ocean – the so-called Unterzee.These games, horrifying and hilarious in nearly equal measure, were rooted in a deft sense of place. Mandrake foregrounds location in a friendlier, more accessible way. The beauty of the rural life sim, as game director Adam Myers sees it, is that “you’re able to zoom in on one community over time”. Across days, nights and seasons, the player bears witness to a changing place and its people. You go from a sense of total unfamiliarity, says Myers, to having developed a deep knowledge of the environment.But Mandrake aims to eschew the genre’s grindier tendencies – cultivating acres of wheat and making multiple daily meals. “It isn’t optimal to grow your crops in large rectangular monocultures,” says Myers. “And you’re not doing the thing where you click 30 times and carry a banquet’s worth of ratatouille around in your inventory at all times.”View image in fullscreenComplicating rural the rural sim … Mandrake.Photograph: Failbetter GamesGift-giving, the typical way players ingratiate themselves with their NPC neighbours in this genre, arrives with a wrinkle. Players cannot just hand out presents randomly (“That’s a little awkward,” laughs Myers). Instead, they must declare why they are handing out their offerings. This forms the start of a relationship based on obligation.The aim is to not just replicate the pattern seen in other rural life sims, but “complicate” it, both through thoughtful mechanics and an unusual set of influences. Myers talks enthusiastically of anthropology, British folklore and esoteric traditions such as Renaissance alchemy. The world is filled with quirky and mysterious lore: it is inhabited by “quasi-monastic organisations” and despite the Welsh influences in the landscape, there is an eerie absence of sheep.The comforting rituals of the rural life sim seem to function as a Trojan horse for Failbetter’s peculiar and offbeat tendencies. “One of the error patterns we’ve fallen into in the past is going too weird, too fast, too soon,” admits Myers. “We need to give players more stable ground to stand on so they can make sense of everything – put the pieces together to properly appreciate what’s unusual and strange.”Ominous creatures undoubtedly lurk in these ancient woods; villagers are likely to conceal many portentous secrets. It’s reasonable to assume that Myers’s and his colleagues’ taste for the macabre surfaces in some manner. But there’s a crucial difference, a concession, perhaps, to maintaining what he hopes is a welcoming and “emotionally gentle” tone: unlike some of Failbetter’s other games, death doesn’t lurk quite so close to your shoulder. Or as Myers puts it, “you probably won’t be able to get yourself eaten in this one”.Mandrake is in development for PC with console support planned.

Jobs wins it and from hereon the rivalry is on – or that is how this production spins it.Capturing the vaguest approximation of the relationship between the men, there is little fidelity to fact, or nuance, or penetrating psychological unpicking. But it is a highly entertaining, well put together parody all the same, however cartoonish in its portrayal of the two central players. It takes swipes at technology (from old-school cameras to printers and the limited life ofAppleproducts) and the nerdy megalomania of tech culture itself.Under the direction of Nick Winston, characters resemble the geeks from TV series The IT Crowd. To a lesser degree, it is about self-acceptance from those deemed oddballs by their school bullies, mainly through the character of Gates. Jobs is, by contrast, a visionary hippy and self-serving ladies’ man whose charisma Gates envies. Both are ridiculed and brilliantly performed.View image in fullscreenA visionary hippy … Kane Oliver Parry in Nerds.Photograph: Pamela RaithWriter-lyricists Jordan Allen-Dutton and Erik Weiner give the show a high school style makeover while Hal Goldberg’s score brings easy, fun tunes. There are romances for the men in Sally (Elise Zavou), a Xerox researcher with a social conscience, and fellow nerd Myrtle (Teleri Hughes) for Gates. Their real-life love lives, and wives, are nowhere to be found.Real life is ignored or smoothed over on the whole: there is a legal battle, which follows some facts around Apple’s suing of Microsoft in 1988, and it ends in an out-of-court settlement, but without really telling us how or why. But it includes a thoroughly amusing rap battle between Gates and Jobs – a highlight of the show – which leads to the sudden transformation of Gates from an insecure tyrant into a fairy godfather of sorts. He steps away from Microsoft willingly here and devotes himself to his charitable foundation. Jobs’ death from cancer is ignored, too, although there is a – very funny – song in which he writes an email to God (with lots of ccs) because he thinks he is dying.While it fails in its factual history, this is a compelling parody of the tech age, then and now, with heaps of the fun factor.AtCowbarn at Underbelly, Bristo Square, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)MusicalsBill GatesSteve JobsreviewsShareReuse this content"

He also seized control of the DC municipal police department, invoking an obscure section of the 1973 D.C. Home Rule Act which allows the president to take control of local law enforcement in the district for a period of one month in times of emergency.That there is no emergency is irrelevant: Trump has declared one in order to exercise powers that are only available to him in a state of exception, which is, of course, what the whole country increasingly finds itself to be experiencing as the president expands the powers of his office from those of a constitutional executive into something more like the power of authoritarian control.The move follows the Trump administration’s deployment of both the National Guard and the Marines to Los Angeles earlier this year; in a press conference announcing the move on Monday, Trump suggested that he also intends to deploy the military to cities such as Baltimore, Oakland and New York. “This will go further,” he said. “We’re starting very strongly with DC” The deployment reflects Trump’s continued determination to further erode the longstanding American taboo against deploying military personnel for domestic law enforcement.It hardly matters what the pretext for such moves are. In LA, Trump claimed that protests against his administration’s kidnapping of immigrants was causing unsustainable disorder in the city; it wasn’t. In DC, Trump is likewise claiming that crime is out of control; it is not. (Crime has in fact dropped precipitously in Washington over the past decade, with violent crimes declining bymore than halfsince 2013; there has been an especially steep decline in the crime rate since 2023.)In a bit of dark comedy, attorney general Pam Bondi appeared at the press conference and stood at a podium to declare that crime in DC would soon come to an end, all while flanked by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and President Trump, two men accused – and, in Trump’s case, convicted – of numerous crimes themselves.But no one is really supposed to believe that the deployment of troops to America’s most liberal, most racially diverse, and most culturally thriving cities is an actual response to an actual crisis. Rather, the thinness of the pretext is itself a demonstration of power. The Trump administration, and national Republicans more broadly, have increasingly been willing to argue that Democratic rule is illegitimate even where Democratic politicians are duly elected; the nationalization of law enforcement in DC follows from this premise, seizing authority that rightly belongs to the Democratic local officials and distributing it to the Republican national figures who will brook no disagreement and tolerate no imposition of policies with which they disagree.Such a move may not, in the end, lead to widespread violence: aside from the lack of much actual crime for them to respond to, the capital is unbearably hot in the summertime, and one imagines sleepy-looking National Guard troops wandering aimlessly around the National Mall in the August swamp heat, wilted and sweaty in their tactical gear. But the imposition should, in a country with sufficient civic virtue, spawn mass protests all the same.The troops, after all, are not there to solve a real problem; there is no actual crisis for Trump to exploit. They are there, instead, because the president wants to send a message: that cities and states that are not sufficiently deferential to him in law will have his will imposed on them by force. The result is the same politics of shakedown and threat that Trump has wielded so successfully againstuniversitiesandmajor businesses: he will impose suffering on anyone who does not defer to his will.One strange facet of the Trump era is the continually receding horizon of terms like “dictatorship” and “authoritarianism.” Is it an “authoritarian” move for Trump to seize control of the DC police force if a statute technically grants him the legal authority to do so? Is it a “dictatorship” if the mechanisms used to extend presidential control into things like private university admissions policies partakes of the nominal consent of administrators?Is it really a collapsed democracy if the soldiers marching down the streets of the capitol haven’t actually wound up shooting anyone yet? These are the kinds of questions that sound ridiculous and naïve when you say them out loud; they sound like the kind of excuse-making one engages in when the effort to maintain denial has become desperate. They are also, often, debates involving the sort of semantic questions that are a bad sign when they come up at all: if the answer was good, no one would be asking the question.But the militarization of DC also illustrates a core feature of fascist regimes, which is their collapse of rhetoric and reality. Symbolism, language, images: these are core to Trump’s political project, which is as much mythic as it is material. Trump’s claims about crime and disorder are plain lies. But the ability to make your lies have the force of fact is a terrifying power. No one can doubt that Trump has seized it.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

People feel entitled to cushy jobs with fat salaries and unlimited holiday time. And by “people” I mean American politicians, who seem to treat public office as an excuse forendless vacations. Because the president and vice-president are technically always on duty, there’s no official holiday policy – and it rather feels as if they are taking advantage of this.Take the vice-president, JD “OOO (out of office)” Vance. When he’s notinspiring memesor threatening to deportmenswear influencers, he always seems to be off on a jolly. So far this year, the man has beenskiing in Vermont, shut down bits ofDisneyland for his family’s useand apparently raised thewater level of a river in Ohio for a kayaking trip. Now, the Vances aresummering in the Cotswolds.Vance, who unsuccessfully tried out for hishigh school golf team, can also occasionally be foundhitting ballswith his boss. Which is actually pretty hard work, since we all know Trump is a gifted sportsman; in April, the White House doctor cited the president’s“frequent victories in golf events”as evidence of Trump’s excellent health. And Trumpshouldbe good, considering he’s so far spent 25% of his second term golfing, according to the online trackerDid Trump Golf Today?. Lovely for him;expensive for the taxpayer.Trump was oncevery criticalof Barack Obama’s numerous golf outings. “I’m going to be working for you, I’m not going to have time to go play golf,”Trump said in 2016. He managed to find the time: a 2021 Washington Post analysis found that Trump probably played261 rounds of golfin his first term – a round every 5.6 days. This term, he’s on trackto surpass that number.Trump has alsocomplained about work-from-home policies, saying that people will take advantage and“play golf”instead. It’s different whenheplays golf, though. A workhorse like Trump can be productive anywhere!On Sunday, for example, while being driven from the White House to his golf club in Virginia, Trump (or one of his minions) snapped a few photos of homeless people, which heposted on social mediawith his typically nuanced analysis. “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump stated. “Be prepared! There will be no ‘MR. NICE GUY.’” Not everyone is capable of crafting complex policy proposals on how to reduce homelessness while being chauffeured to a tee time. It’s a skill set such as this that separates the wheat from the chaff.How did John Oliver become the moral compass of the US? |  Arwa MahdawiRead moreSpeaking of the chaff: guess how much paid time off (PTO) normies in the US are entitled to? The answer, if you’re looking at federal law,is none; it’s up to your employer. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average amount of vacation private sector workers getafter one yearat a company is 11 days. For government workers, it’s 13 days. (PTO often increases over time, but median job tenure in the US isless than five years.) What happens if you get sick and need more time off? You’d better hope that your colleagues arenice enoughtodonate their sick daysto you. By contrast, in the UK,most full-time workersare entitled to 28 days of paid annual leave from the get-go.While US vacation policy may seem miserly to outsiders, Trump thinks it’s far too generous. On Juneteenth, a holiday commemoratingthe emancipation of enslaved peoplein the US, the president complained that, despite the fact that private-sector companies don’t have to give employees the day off for federal holidays, there were too many holidays in the US and“workers don’t want it”.Like many things the president says, this is nonsense. On the contrary:Microsoft’s 2025 work index reportfound that, because of the always-on nature of technology, many workers are struggling with “infinite workdays” and burnout. How is Microsoft combating that? Glad you asked! They recently teamed up with Mercedes-Benz to bring“in-car productivity to a new level”by making it easier totake meetings while driving. Behold the American dream: nonstop work for the masses and endless golfing vacays for the guys at the top.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Meanwhile, vaccine exemptions reached a record high.These statistics became all the more disturbing last fall when, shortly after286,000 childrenbegan their educations without proof of full immunity against measles, a man who hasbragged about never getting a flu shotwas re-elected to the presidency. Since then, the US has contended with itslargest measles outbreak in three decades, while the leaders who should be stamping out this crisis are instead fanning the flames.In just eight months, Trump andRobert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, have made every effort to undermine one of the major civilizing advances of the 20th century – our public health infrastructure. In doing so, they risk endangering millions of people and kickstarting a doom loop of mistrust from which it could take decades to recover.As usual, the Trump administration’s stance on vaccines is motivated less by sincere populism and more by personal profit. Before Kennedy launched his own presidential campaign on a platform of “making America healthy again”, he earned$20,000 every weekhelming a non-profit dedicated to fostering vaccine skepticism. Now in the cabinet, he has fired the entireCDC vaccine advisory paneland replaced them with a ragtag crew, half of whom havenever published peer-reviewed researchon vaccines. Just last week, Kennedycancelled $500m of federal fundingfor mRNA vaccines, whichprevented 14m deathsduring the Covid-19 pandemic. And he has made these rollbacks whileretaining a financial stakein ongoing litigation against a vaccine manufacturer.All the while, the US has seen more than1,300 measles casesand three deaths this year. In response, Kennedy has alternatelyendorsedandunderminedthe most effective method of prevention – widespread immunization.The evisceration of funding has extended across the sciences, with Trump cutting support for research to a35-year nadir. At the National Institutes of Health,1,800 grantshave been terminated, a move that the Government Accountability Officedeemed illegal. The administration also continues to freeze grants to universities over culture war phantasms like DEI, including$339m at UCLAand$2.2bn at Harvard. So it’s not surprising that75% of US scientistspolled by the journal Nature are considering leaving the country, which raises the prospect of a lost generation of American talent and lifesaving innovation.Internationally, Trump’s heartless and thoughtless budget cuts are causing devastation. The administrationhas dismantled USAID,one of the most successful preventers of contagious disease in history. In doing so, it defunded programs thatvaccinated more than 800 million childrenagainst fatal illnesses like malaria. Researchers have found that300,000 people have already diedbecause of these cuts, which could lead to another14m preventable deathsover the next five years – all to gut an agency that managed theequivalentof 4% ofthe annual national defense budget.Back in the US, medical associations, local officials and individual doctors arecollaborating to buy vaccinesdirectly from manufacturers and lobbying insurance companies to continue covering the costs of those shots. Their efforts reflect a tried-and-true strategy to counter under-immunization. Before the current outbreak, Ronald Reagan-era cuts to public health causeda more widespread measles pandemic, with 27,000 cases in just 1990. But locally led outreach campaigns and grassroots vaccination programs turned back the crisis, as did an eventual restoration of federal funds under Bill Clinton’s administration.Budget cuts can be reversed, but trust may be more difficult to recover. Long before RFK Jr’s ascendancy, disasters like the CDC’s infamousUntreated Syphilis Study at Tuskegeeand the Food and Drug Administration’sglacial response to the Aids crisiscast long shadows over public health institutions. Today, a plurality of Americansare already predictingthey will lose faith in medical guidance under the current administration. That would undermine the very basis of public health, which depends on people choosing to follow guidelines grounded in research they did not personally conduct and whose results they are ill-trained to parse.Repairing that breach will require years of effortful relationship-building, but it might also require rallying Americans with the classic tactic of patriotism. For all of Trump’s bellicose rhetoric, he misses that our nation’s most extraordinary scientific and medical advances have drawn bipartisan enthusiasm in part because they reinforced a perceived American exceptionalism. At the height of the cold war, RFK Jr’s unclechose to go to the moon, and Richard Nixonbrought that dream to fulfilment. After Franklin Delano Roosevelt founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Americans helped fund it bymailing in more than 2.5m dimes, hence its christening as the March of Dimes. That money supported Jonas Salk’s development of the polio vaccine. Within two years of its introduction, annual cases of polio hadfallen by 90%.Even Trump, whobotched the initial responseto Covid-19, managed to overseethe historic Operation Warp Speed. If only he could recognize thatthisis the kind of achievement which makes America great.Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrOpinionDonald TrumpHealthVaccines and immunisationTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

If Zelenskyy is a worried man, who can blame him?Tue 12 Aug 2025 07.52 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareGood to have it confirmed that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will be talking about Ukraine behind its back on Friday in Alaska, as the US president rambled through a press conference on Monday in which he explained that Putin “wasn’t going to mess with me” and that Ukraine was going to have to accept new borders. And listen – you’ll agree that territorial pronouncements mean so much more coming from a guy whose staff once shamelesslyredrew a hurricane impact mapto stop him looking stoopid. It’s a true honour for the Ukrainians to see their country effectively carved up by someone who would prefer to post-rationalise any old crap with a Sharpie than admit he doesn’t have the first clue about it and cares even less.Leave it to the tasteful visionarybehind the Gaza Rivierato categorise what he’s doing as trying to get back some of Ukraine’s “oceanfront property”. “In real estate we call it oceanfront property,” Trump said on Monday, demystifying this term of high art for non-developers who haven’t contrived to bankrupt several Atlantic City casinos. “That’s always the most valuable property.” Thanks, Mister Mogul! It is assumed that the stretch of high-end primo coastline Trump was referring to included Mariupol, the utterly ruined port in which many thousands of civilians perished during the Russian siege. In international law we call it a possible war crime; in real estate we call it … what? Strategic pre-construction? Spa-chitecture?Certainly, how we put things is a matter of concern to this supremely sensitive president, who can find words very hurty, particularly when allied to optional concepts such as truth or the law. “I was a little bothered by the fact Zelenskyy was saying, ‘I have to get constitutional approval,’” he whined on Monday of the Ukrainian leader’s desire to put any peace deal to the Ukrainian people via a referendum. “He’s got approval to go into war and kill everybody?” Again, whetherUkraine“go[ing] into war” is a fair categorisation of its being invaded by Russia is not something that bothers the Sharpie king of the White House.As for the precise nature of the forthcoming cartography, Trump spent quite a lot of time talking suspiciously nebulously about “land swapping”. Can you swap things on behalf of someone who doesn’t want to swap them, and without them being present at the table? If so, I would like someone to swap me one of Trump’s second-tier golf courses, and would expect him to be very relaxed about it. He’ll just have to take my word that it’s in the wider interests of everybody.In terms of what he deems to be the interests of interested parties, there has been some strong suggestion in recent days that the Trump administration thinks it would be a win for Ukraine to abandon the bits of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that are not even occupied by Russia, with only a ceasefire and the promise of some future better deal to show for it. Which would certainly be the absolute wrongest reading of a land deal since the New York Tribunecalled the Alaska purchasea folly and a waste of money.In fact, it would explain Putin’s willingness to travel to that very territory to hold Friday’s peace talks instead of doing it on neutral turf – you can probably afford to concede on the meeting location if everything else is likely to be such a complete gift to you. The Russian president might even bring along anotherhideously flattering portraitof Trump as an ice-breaking present, having already commissioned one as a personal gift earlier this year, which was passed on to Trump via his special envoy Steve Witkoff. Witkoff said it was a “beautiful portrait” and that the president was “clearly touched by it”.And so to the buildup to Friday. We’ll have to see how excited Trump gets about the chance to join some sort of German-organised conference call with European leaders on Wednesday. For the US president, the negotiating table is a place that seats only two people, one of which should always be him. For Putin, many fear through bitter experience, the negotiating table is a place where you simply obfuscate and buy time to regroup before renewing aggression. Rather like Holly Golightly at the window of Tiffany’s, nothing very bad can happen to Putin in Alaska. Merely turning up avoids the threatened sanctions. If, as seems likely, Trump decides he should be appeased with some land, any Ukrainian refusal to rubber-stamp this would leave him frustrated with and lashing out at Zelenskyy, not Putin. (Give the orange guy his peace deal and then his peace prize, dammit! He’s getting bored out here.) And if a ceasefire is somehow agreed, it would surely, on the form book, be regarded by Putin merely as a strategic buying of time. The Russian leader is obsessed with Ukraine in a way the Trump administration seems incapable of, or indifferent to, grasping.Look, maybe geopolitics really will turn out to be just a simpler version of commercial real estate. Maybe someone who has lost almost as many fortunes as he has gained in that particular trade really will turn out to be a maverick master whose refresh-the-parts traditional diplomacy can’t reach. Maybe! But the sheer lack of jeopardy for Putin in Alaska feels far more significant than the mood music. The best-case scenario is that Europe and Ukraine prepare themselves for the artlessness of the deal. The worst-case scenario is a darker pathway altogether – and one we seem increasingly likely to stumble on to.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionVladimir PutinRussiaUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

That’s a bad ideaCarlo Invernizzi-AccettiWhen a house is on fire, more fire won’t helpTue 12 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 06.04 EDTShareWhenTexasRepublicansunveiled yet another contorted congressional map last week – one that would all buterase Austin’s Latino-led seatand increase the Republican party’s federal House tally by up to five seats in total – the outcry from Democrats was immediate and justified. But beyond theDemocraticstate legislators’ brave effort tostymie the proposalby boycotting the vote, a different refrain has also been heard by leading Democrats in other states:if they do it, why can’t we?Governor Gavin Newsom of California has vowed to “fight fire with fire”, advancing a proposal that would redraw California’s own congressional map to offset Republican gains in Texas. New York’s Kathy Hochul has also embraced the prospect ofaggressive gerrymanderingin Democratic-controlled states, sidestepping the independent commissions that Democrats themselves had once championed and successfully implemented in both California and New York.It is an understandable impulse, but it is the wrong one – for both strategic and principled reasons. To begin with,Democratsare destined to lose a gerrymandering arms race. They control fewer state legislatures and the very nature of electoral map engineering currently favors Republican power-grabbing, since most Democratic voters live in densely populated urban areas, which makes it easier to concentrate them in fewer electoral districts.The US supreme court paved the way for Texas’s gerrymandering mess | Steven GreenhouseRead moreA simulation conducted through 538’sAtlas of Redistrictingin which every state is aggressively gerrymandered to maximize the House seats of the party in power at the state level results in a notional House of 262 Republicans and 173 Democrats: a 30-plus seat jump for the Republican party compared with a non-partisan map that maximizes for district compactness. Nor is this a far-fetched scenario. Rather than forcing the other side to back down, retaliation appears more likely to lead to further escalation, in this as in other domains of all-out binary conflict.When running for governor of Illinois in 2018, JB Pritzker had initially pledged to back an independent districting commission but subsequently signed one of the most brutal Democratic gerrymandering plans in the country, which has yielded just three Republican districts out of 17 in a state whereDonald Trumpwon 43% of the votes in 2024. That precedent is now beingpointed to by Texas Republicansto justify their own gerrymandering plan.But there is also a deeper reason why “fighting fire with fire” is a bad idea when the goal is to protect democracy from purported challenges to it: the “fire” in question amounts to a violation of one of democracy’s core values – ultimately, the principle of voting equality – and would therefore end up doing the work of democracy’s enemies for them.The metaphor of “fighting fire with fire” can in fact be traced back to the thought of the German émigré scholar to the United States, Karl Loewenstein, who in the 1930s recommended the use of self-consciously “anti-democratic means” – such as party bans and restrictions of voting rights – to fight fascism, in the name of what he called “militant democracy”.Far from achieving their intended goal, such measures were instrumental in the consolidation of the Nazi regime in Germany, given that Adolf Hitler was first nominated chancellor through an emergency presidential decree intended to forestall the prospect of a socialist takeover (construed as a greater threat for German democracy than nazism itself), and that the ban on other political parties Hitler quickly imposed was justified on the grounds that it was necessary to protect the German constitutional order in the aftermath of the Reichstag fire of 1934.Similarly perverse uses of the logic of “militant democracy” have since become a standard component of the authoritarian playbook – from Augusto Pinochet’s 1973 coup in Chile to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s 2016 counter-coup in Turkey, both of which undid democracy in their countries under the guise of protecting it against purported enemies.A fully gerrymandered congressional map in the United States would thus not just be bad for Democrats. It would also be terrible for American democracy since it would effectively disenfranchise local minorities across the country, yielding an overall competition between two mirroring forms of authoritarianism: Democratic or Republican one-party rule at the local level.If Democrats want to continue to portray themselves as the party of democracy against theTrump administration’s thinly veiled authoritarian ambitions, they should begin by practicing on own their turf the same principles of democratic civility and self-restraint they accuse their opponents of violating.How did we get all this gerrymandering? A short history of the Republican redistricting schemeRead moreCrucially, this doesn’t mean “doing nothing” in the face of Republican gerrymandering. The point is rather that (big and small “D”) Democrats should usedemocraticrather than authoritarian means to protect democracy against its enemies – which is to say, win elections by advancing more attractive policy platforms and mobilizing voters more effectively in support of them, rather than by changing the rules to their own benefit.That the Trump administration’s substantive policy decisions – from its inflationarytrade warsto the fiscally regressiveOne Big Beautiful Bill Act– seem destined to do most harm its own electoral constituencies offers plenty of opportunity for fair-and-square political comeback. Ultimately, however, the Democrats’ chances of success in upcoming electoral cycles will depend on their capacity to present a more attractive political alternative to the current Republican party’s brand of populist authoritarianism.Instead of mirroring their opponents, Democrats should therefore seek todifferentiatethemselves from them, which at present can only mean: strict adherence to democratic norms and forthright advocacy of a more progressive policy platform. When a house is on fire, more fire won’t help. What is needed is water – which is to say, something different, that is at the same time an antidote against fire’s damaging effects.Carlo Invernizzi-Accetti is an associate professor of political science at the City University of New York, City CollegeExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionDemocratsTexasGavin NewsomUS voting rightscommentShareReuse this content"

I experienced firsthand the absence of support for whistleblowers. That is why I am firm in my belief that we need whistleblower reform, now, including the establishment of a Whistleblower Protection Authority.For most of my career, I have worked for Services Australia. I was on the frontline of the implementation of what became known as robodebt. As I explained in mytestimony to the robodebt royal commission, involvement in robodebt was a deeply traumatic experience.I tried, from the very beginning, when I was part of an initial robodebt pilot, to blow the whistle on the scheme. I immediately sawrobodebt for what the royal commission eventually concluded it to be: unlawful and deeply unethical. I thought it should be stopped, to never proceed beyond the pilot.But when I, and others, raised concerns, we were met with a clear, stark message: resign, transfer or comply. The message was as blunt as that: shut up or leave.The robodebt investigation about-face is a win for Australia’s new integrity system. Here’s why | AJ BrownRead moreOur concerns were ignored. Instead, we received threatening communications. Performance targets, threats of underperformance notices and code of conduct breaches were used to suppress dissent. Daily emails reminded us that if we spoke to anyone outside our team about our work, we could face termination.There was no safe, independent mechanism for staff to report concerns without fear of reprisal. If such a body had existed, I believe many more staff would have spoken out, and robodebt may have been stopped before it began. Think about what that might have prevented – the trauma avoided, the beautiful lives not lost as a result, the billions in taxpayer dollars not wasted.If whistleblowers were protected and empowered, not punished, maybe we could have avoided robodebt altogether.At its core, robodebt was a breakdown of integrity. A logical response in such situations is to go outside that system and report – somewhere, some way, somehow. While the integrity of all government systems rely on public confidence, there are a range of reasons the integrity of those systems can be compromised. Whistleblowing is a vital safety valve when those systems fail.No doubt you will hear much today about the importance of whistleblowing, and how we can improve support and protection for whistleblowing. But I want to speak to the personal cost of speaking out. I lost my career. My mental health suffered. I struggled with alcohol dependency. I became unable to properly parent, or care for my elderly parent. I endured suicidal ideation.A decade since I first blew the whistle on robodebt, and over two years since I gave evidence to the royal commission, I am still suffering. I was so traumatised by my experience that I am on workers’ compensation, barely subsisting on a fraction of my former salary. Ultimately my family, my career and my colleagues have paid the high price for speaking up.3:27Anthony Albanese says robodebt was 'a gross betrayal and a human tragedy' – videoMeanwhile, those most responsible for robodebt have faced no real consequences. The royal commission vindicated those who raised concerns, yet still we suffer. Society benefits when whistleblowers speak up – ultimately, robodebt was stopped. But we are left on the scrap heap, paying a high price for our sacrifice – a sacrifice made in the public interest.I am not the only one. In recent years there have been Australians prosecuted for blowing the whistle, a whistleblower imprisoned for speaking up. There are dozens more who have had their careers ended, or sidelined, for doing the right thing, not to mention those – including many colleagues during robodebt – who simply walked away in disgust.For this reason alone there should be some sort of mechanism to support whistleblowers who speak up in the public interest. To have a body which can offer a modicum of protection to those who would bring “right” to a place where it can be considered, should be at the core of efforts to restore credibility in Australian public institutions.That is why we need a Whistleblower Protection Authority. That is why I came here today, to call on the Albanese government and attorney general Michelle Rowland to act.Whistleblower protections must ensure that those who speak out for what is right are not punished for doing so. Integrity in our public systems depend on it.Jeannie-Marie Blake is a public servant.

Just as the Gaza journalistic community thought matters could not get any worse, Benjamin Netanyahu’s brutal occupying forces carried out yet another cold-blooded murder on Sunday, this time of the Al Jazeera journalistsAnas al-Sharifand Mohammed Qraiqea, along with videographers Ibrahim Thaher, Mohammed Nofal and their colleagues. They were sheltering in a media tent near al-Shifa hospital, and were killed by a direct strike.The Israeli war machine, accelerating its stated goal of occupying Gaza, showed no restraint in targeting journalists, in violation of international conventions. So far in this warit has killed 238of us. The war on Gaza has become the deadliest conflict for journalists and media workers in living memory, with2024 recording the highest numberof journalists killed, the vast majority at the hands of Israeli forces. The systematic targeting and elimination of journalists is not merely a local or regional tragedy; it is a catastrophic breach of international norms regarding the protection of journalists in conflict zones, signalling a global collapse of the moral responsibility in safeguarding those who risk everything to shed light on the realities of war.Gaza is not the only place where journalists are under siege. Threats, intimidation and murderous violence against journalists are on the rise. However, what differentiates Israeli crimes is the impunity with which the occupation forces murder journalists and the indifference shown by leaders of the so-called free world. What is especially shocking is when some media organisations repeat the Israeli regime’s false allegations against targeted journalists without verification.By any measure, it is the most dangerous time to be a journalist in recent history. Reporters are threatened, harassed and killed merely for fulfilling their public duty of bearing witness and reporting the truth. Worldwide, the dangers faced by journalists in conflict zones have intensified. In 2023, a journalist or media worker was killed, on average, every four days. In 2024, this grim statistic worsened to onceevery three days, most of those by Israeli forces. The journalists in Gaza are not parachuted-in international correspondents but local journalists – those who know the land, the people and the stories best. These journalists are not just reporting on Gaza’s tragedy; they are living it.This surge in violence against journalists is neither accidental nor isolated. It is part of a broader, deeply worrying trend: the systematic silencing of the media, often orchestrated by autocrats and regimes who seek to conceal their crimes in darkness. This should horrify us all. It is an assault not only on individual reporters but on the entire global public’s right to know, to understand the depth of human suffering, and to hold the powerful to account.1:22Al Jazeera's Anas al-Sharif among five journalists killed by Israel in Gaza – videoBeyond the killings of more than 230 journalists, Israel now employs starvation as a tool, with journalists pushed to the brink, collapsing from hunger while reporting. AtAl Jazeera, we have lost colleagues and their family members in Gaza, with the latest killing of Anas al-Sharif and his colleagues bringing the total number of the network’s journalists killed to nine. Our colleagues have been forced to report not just on the atrocities happening to civilians, but on the direct attacks against those whose only weapon is a microphone or a camera.Despite this, we insist on continuing in our professional duty. We remain committed to reporting unfolding genocide, despite Israeli efforts to blind us and the world. We will tirelessly work to strengthen the teams and to remain faithful to our global audience, who have a right to be informed. But this requires international solidarity, and the exertion of full pressure on Israel to stop targeting and killing journalists and to allow international media access and freedom of operation in theGazaStrip.The international community must act, urgently and decisively, to safeguard journalists and to protect those who risk everything to inform the world about the continuing humanitarian catastrophe and genocide in Gaza. Journalists must be allowed to perform their duties without fear of violence. Anything less is a betrayal of the most fundamental principles of free expression.‘If these words reach you … Israel has succeeded in killing me’: the last words of a journalist killed in GazaRead moreWe owe it to the courageous journalists in Gaza to amplify their voices. Their work is not merely documentation; it is the first draft of history, whereby future historians will study the horrors of the 21st century’s most televised genocide. Access to reliable information about wars and conflicts is not a luxury; it is essential for the wellbeing of global populations, the protection of human rights and the global effort to hold perpetrators of war crimes accountable. When journalists are silenced, we all become more vulnerable to disinformation, propaganda and the unchecked abuse of power.We are at a crossroads. If the world continues to tolerate the murder, starvation and persecution of journalists, it is not only journalism that will suffer, but also accountability, democracy and the possibility of a more just future. The international legal framework for the protection of journalists in war must be urgently strengthened and enforced, and governments must be held to account for violations.The international journalistic community, and indeed the world, bears an immense responsibility. The courage, commitment and sacrifice of journalists in Gaza demand nothing less than our full support and unrelenting advocacy. Our inaction will be recorded by history as a monumental failure to protect those who stood at the frontlines of truth.Asef Hamidi is the director of news, Al Jazeera ChannelDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is only when technology augments human capability that genuine productivity is achieved.Should big tech be allowed to mine Australians’ text and data to train AI? The Productivity Commission is considering itRead moreTo reap that collective dividend, he argues workers must be given the opportunity to not just use the new technology but to shape it: designing new tools, new connections, new markets and new capabilities.UTS’s Human Technology Institute has tested Acemoglu’s theorywith stark results: nurses embrace AI to manage their crippling paperwork but draw the line at patient intervention; retail workers welcome smarter inventory while seeking to preserve customer relationships; gun-shy public servants seek the confidence the technology won’t be used against citizens in another robodebt.The Australian Council of Trade Unions is calling for stronger protections on AI work replacement, including veto rights. I think Acemoglu would say this is not ambitious enough: if we want AI to add to national wealth rather than extract wealth for tech rent-seekers and lazy cost-cutters, we need to assert democratic control over the technology.So the big reform idea I’d put forward in Acemoglu’s absence is the mandating of “worker councils” to oversee, monitor and shape the introduction of machine learning and large language models.How would it work?Regardless of whether the government ends up pursuing a standalone AI act, it should expand the general duty of care employers discharge under workplace safety to include the introduction of new technology.To discharge that general duty, employers (either individually or as an industry) would need to show they had actively engaged their workers in the technology and had given them the opportunity to test, refine, propose guardrails and enforce red lines.The workers councils would be democratic and representative, provided with the information needed to understand the technology, the remit to observe its use in the workplace and an ongoing role in monitoring its impact.Where a union is active this could be through existing consultative processes; where there is no union, it would be incumbent upon employers or broader industry bodies to establish genuinely accountable processes.This needs to be part of the broader discussion about the way AI is regulated, rather than looking for specific rules for future use cases establishing that a general duty of care creates ongoing accountability for when things go wrong (as they inevitably will).What are the downsides?Employers would cry foul about more “red tape” or a worker takeover of business operations; but actively involving workers is not about giving up power; it is harnessing existing knowledge.Let’s be honest: most tech transformations are complete failures. Not because the tech itself is bad, but because it’s just not suited to the realities of how people work. To think that AI is somehow different in this regard is what the vendors want, but it’s madness.A broader pushback will come from the tech industry, which is pitching the narrative that we need to “win” the race to AI before other countries get ahead of us, meaning any move to impose friction around change risks “stifling innovation”.If democracy wasn’t facing collapse, if our kids weren’t falling prey to exploitative algorithms, if the models weren’t built on the stolen labour of creators, if the same companies pushing AI hadn’t abrogated their responsibility with social media platforms, maybe we would give them the benefit of the doubt. But they have not earned this.There may be advantages in stepping back and not racing headlong into a future driven by self-interested and increasingly bad faith actors; refusing to allow our workforce to be their canary in the coalmine, with government expected to step in when things go pear-shaped.Australia and the AI revolution – turning algorithms into opportunitiesRead moreRather than be the invisible bystanders of Big Tech, workers, through AI councils, can become part of a hard-headed economic response to a technology that is still being developed, with models and structures that are still in a state of flux.How about the politics?We knowAustralians are deeply sceptical of AI. There is a growing sense that it is outside of our control and being imposed on us for some ill-defined greater good.Imagining new sorts of democratic structures would give us a modicum of agency in determining how these tools should evolve and how the core resource driving them – our data – should be collected, refined and how we should be compensated for its use.Indeed, the same structures that would govern AI in the workplace could be developed to give citizens a broader voice in the development of technology that is still highly contested.Our tech future is not predetermined; ensuring we all have an informed say in these hugely consequential decisions will not just define the technology, but the sort of nation we become.And if the apostles of AI are right and this really is godlike technology that will deliver economic nirvana, then embedding these democratic structures in their development will help earn the trust of a public that has been over-sold on tech utopia before.Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company that undertook research for Labor in the last election and conducts qualitative research for Guardian Australia.

No wonder those who benefit are loth to change itPeter Apps is a contributing editor at Inside HousingTue 12 Aug 2025 09.29 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 12.19 EDTShareIn the 1970s, private landlordism in the UK was a fringe part of the market – and a dying one. With council housing plentiful and house prices within the range of those with decent, working-class jobs, we did not need private landlords. In the mid-1970s, the Conservative Policy Council had written that their decline was “quite irreversible” and that within a generation they would be “as extinct as the dinosaur”.This prediction has proved to be among the worst ever made about the UK housing market. Since then, our reliance on private landlords has exploded. They are now the first port of call for everyone in the market who cannot afford to buy: students, graduates, families, pensioners, refugees and more. There are 2.8 million private landlords in Britain – almost twice as many people as work for NHSEnglandand almost four times the UK’s entire workforce of teachers.How did we go from one extreme to the other? We chose it.In 1979 Margaret Thatcher arrived with a new vision for the country. As she defunded and sold off council housing, her plan was that the private market would take its place. A big-bang deregulation of private renting in 1988 swept away rent control and introduced short tenancies where the tenant could be evicted at the end without the landlord needing a reason.Her expectation was big, strategic investment from the corporate world – there was demand for rented housing, so there would be supply. Competition would drive up standards. The state just needed to get out of the way and let it happen. But instead, something else happened.In 1996,“buy-to-let” mortgages were launched, targeting everyman investors with a bit of spare cash. Previously, the only way to build up a property portfolio was to take out a commercial mortgage. This new product was available to anyone with a deposit, the repayments were interest only and the mortgages could be written off against tax. This came at a time when aglobal collapse of interest ratesleft lots of people without a viable pension plan, which meant it was suddenly the most obvious, and perhaps only, route to financial security.By 2001, the number of private landlords had exploded, but a survey revealed thatonly 9% of landlordssaw the profession as their full-time occupation. It was the dawn of what the lawyer and writerNick Bano terms“the small-time side hustler”.Today, we live in the wreckage of this policy failure. The thirst for investment assets has driven house prices far beyond the reach of ordinary first-time buyers, especially in big cities. Meanwhile, rents have soared – as landlords make use of Thatcher’s“no-fault evictions”to create an effective ratchet system, where they can quickly and easily evict tenants in favour of whoever can pay the most.We have some of the lowest protections for renters in the developed world, and are, according to the London School of Economics “at one end of the international spectrum on rent control” – ie the end that gives most freedom to landlords. The consequences of this are plain – people on lower incomes can no longer afford to live in the cities where they need to work; those who fall into homelessness are stuck in temporary accommodation indefinitely; and pensioners and families who cannot buy or find council housing are left without security.It is a great failure of policymakers of all parties over the past 35 years that they have simply sat back and let this happen.All of which brings me to Rushanara Ali. Thehomelessness minister resignedlast Thursday after the revelation that she had kicked tenants out of her private rental property, before putting it back on the market at a significantly increased rent. This was, in effect, a classic example of the “ratchet effect” of rent increases, and a major driver of the homelessness she is supposed to prevent.Ali resigned as minister, but retains the Labour whip and returns to the backbenches, where she will join the Labour MP for Ilford South, Jas Athwal, who was exposed last year forrenting out properties with black mouldand ant infestations.They are among83 landlord MPs in the House of Commons– a list that includes the foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. Labour has more landlords among its ranks than any other party, with 43. And this is before we get into the House of Lords – a chamber previously made up exclusively of landowners. There areat least 134 landlord peersin the upper house, although the true number is likely to be much higher – with many holding properties via a trust.All of this poses a big problem in policy terms. Listen to the landlord lobby and you would imagine that policy has turned decisively in favour of tenants in recent years, with landlords’ representative arm warning that forthcoming changes to tax, law and environmental requirements will drive 24% of its members to sell up.The legal change they are worried about is the Renters’ Rights Act, which will abolish no-fault evictions and impose tougher standards for fixing serious disrepair – in other words, attempting to tackle the behaviour of Ali and Athwal respectively.But these laws have been desperately slow coming through. They are a package of changes first announced in April 2019, under the government of Theresa May. That they took six and a half years and a change of government to finally become law owed something to the Conservative party’s fear of its backbenches, asTory MPs pushed back hardagainst the removal of no-fault evictions.We will now get the act, with royal assent likely in September and implementation from 2026. It makes steps towards a more stable, European-style rental market. That it is coming at all shows progress, and perhaps the start of a break in the dominance of the landlord influence in parliament. That it has taken so long shows the control that force has had over our politics until now.Labour does also appear likely to impose a requirement to bring private rented homes up to a moderate standard of environmental efficiency by 2030 – though this faces continual challenge and was previously scrapped by the Conservatives after landlord pressure. Rental reforms, though, remain off limits, despite support from figures outside parliament such as Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham. Labourcalled even limited rent control “cowardice”before the election.Over the past 35 years, we have dug ourselves into a pit. The dominance of the rental market by small-time side hustlers makes any reform perilous: if these landlords sell up, those who need somewhere to rent will be left in the lurch.If we want a functional housing market again, we need a long-term housing strategy that ends our reliance on side hustlers to meet complex housing needs and encourages an economy that treats homes as places to live, not an investment asset to replace a pension. But we are unlikely to ever see such a strategy when it is the side hustlers themselves entrusted to write it.Peter Apps is a contributing editor atInside Housingand the author ofShow Me the Bodies: How We Let Grenfell HappenExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionSocial housingRenting propertyHomelessnessInequalityCommunitiesEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

That’s how oftensomeone is killed or seriously injuredin a collision on the UK’s roads. Each and every one of these accidents brings an unbearable loss: for family and friends left mourning the loved ones who have been cruelly stolen from them, and survivors whose injuries can change their lives for ever. When we talk about how we make our roads safer, it’s easy to get distracted by bluff and bluster. But, every time we do, we lose sight of the most important fact: traffic accidents took over 1,600 lives last year, and we have the power to reduce and prevent them.Take speed limits.Rigorous new researchpublished by Transport for London shows the number of people killed or seriously injured on London borough roads reduced by 34% following the implementation of 20mph speed limits, with the number of children killed falling by 75% (from four to one). That means fewer grieving families and fewer people’s lives made a misery. At the same time, the predicted downsides for drivers simply haven’t materialised. Despite what their detractors might claim, 20mph speed limits haven’t actually made journeys slower because journey times are largely dictated by junction delays, not vehicle speed. Roads where 20mph speed limits apply aren’t just safer; they are quieter, too, encouraging more people to walk or cycle. Those who do drive have fewer collisions andpay lessfor their insurance as a result. It’s no surprise that residents overwhelmingly back slower speed limits in their own communities; more than three out of four of them think that 20mph is the right speed for the area they live in.Our experience isn’t isolated. The first year of a 20mph speed limit scheme in Wales led to100 fewer peoplebeing killed or seriously injured.As mayor of the capital, my approach to road safety has never been about ideology, belief, or bias; it’s about following the evidence and doing what is best. If we want to save lives, the evidence shows that there’s no time to waste. That’s why we’re rolling out 20mph speed limits on appropriate roads. Because of our policies, today half of London’s streets have 20mph speed limits. We’ve created more than 800 “school streets” across our city, cutting toxic air pollution and giving thousands of children a safer, healthier way to get to school. At the same time, we’ve increased the number ofprotected cycle routes fivefold, giving more Londoners the confidence to swap four wheels for two.Step by step, street by street, we have made the capital a better place to walk, cycle and drive. Faced with tough problems, we had the courage to come up with our own answers when the world offered none.When I launched the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), it was the first of its kind anywhere. Others have followed with similar schemes, but London’s is the largest in the world. In 2024,the year after we expanded it, levels of roadside nitrogen dioxide – the toxic gas that exacerbates asthma and raises the risk of lung cancer –declined by 27%. Since 2019, the year the scheme was first introduced, air quality has improved at 99% of monitoring sites across the capital. In a city where air pollution is linked to up to4,000 early deathsevery year, the Ulez is saving lives.It’s not just Ulez. We knew that lorries werefive times more likelyto be involved in a collision causing a fatality relative to their share of traffic. So, in 2021, we became the first place in the world to enforce adirect vision standard for lorries, forcing tens of thousands of dangerous vehicles to implement safety measures and improve how much drivers can see from their cab. Today, that standard is working; in 2023, the number of vulnerable road users killed by an HGV haddeclined by 62%from the 2017-19 baseline. The EU has since introduced a similar scheme, which it expects to save thousands of lives across the continent.When it comes to improving road safety, the record in our capital is second to none. But the truth is that, despite impressive progress, there are still too many places where higher speed limits are putting pedestrians at risk. We can and must do more, because not a single one of the tragedies that take place on the capital’s roads is inevitable. This fundamental principle – that one casualty on our roads is one too many – underpins myVision Zerofor London. By implementing it, we aim to eliminate all deaths and serious injuries on our transport network by 2041. But we will not succeed unless borough councils do their bit.Most of the capital’s boroughs have leapt at the chance to make our roads safer; 21 of them now have a default 20mph speed limit. Unfortunately, though, there are a few councils who have so far refused to play their part. In these blocker boroughs, leaders are fighting against lower speed limits on their streets. To those councils, my message is clear: it’s time to step up. Because there is nothing to be gained by playing politics with speed limits – only people to be injured and lives to be lost.Every day, I meet people who tell me they want to make even more progress to clean up our air and cut speeds on the capital’s streets. Some of them are campaigners who have dedicated their lives to making the way we travel safer and more sustainable. But the vast majority are ordinary citizens: children walking home from school; parents cycling to work; carers driving to see their relatives. What they want is simple: the freedom to go about their lives in the knowledge that they are safe from harm. For their sake, the fight for safer roads must continue.Sadiq Khan is the mayor of LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Indeed, our collective household debt is greater than the size of our entire economy – at an eye-watering 112%, or more than double the European average. Most of that’s inour mortgages, with average home loan debt of nearly $670,000, but more than half of Australians also borrow on credit cards, and about one in eight of us take out personal and/or car loans.So it’s no surprise that millions of Australians breathed a sigh of relief asthe Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rateson Tuesday for the third time since February this year, albeit only by a quarter of a percentage point. While financial markets and most economists expected this latest cut asinflation continued to improve, the July decisionnotto move on rates still had many biting their nails.RBA interest rates decision: relief for borrowers as Reserve Bank cuts cash rate to 3.6%Read moreThe RBA’s “dovish” tone thataccompanied the May rate decisionappears to have been a temporary blip, a reaction to global financial market gyrations in the wake of US President Trump’s initial tariff policy announcements (and re-announcements). Now, the central bank has moved back to the more “hawkish”, or conservative, stance that we have been used to for at least a year. Both upside and downside economic risks have been flagged with this latest decision, and growth forecasts have been nudged down, but the emphasis is clearly on upside risks to inflation. This is despite global uncertainty levels now reachinghistorical highsaccording to some measurements.2:26RBA interest rates: Reserve Bank of Australia cuts official cash rate to 3.6% – videoIndeed, the RBAtells usthat US tariffs are nowhigherthan was expected at the time of the May decision.For many, the debate will now turn to the next step for interest rates. Expectations among economists are not aligned on this front – I’ve seen arguments against even this latest cut, with others expecting two more between now and February. And the RBA’s “guidance”, if we can call it that, is completely opaque.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe good news for indebted Australians is that the RBA’s forecast for inflation over the next two years remains on track with at least two further rate cuts built in. The bad news is that there is “uncertainty” everywhere, not least in the RBA’s confidence in its forecasts, it would seem.As good as this news might be, amidtepid growthanduncertain consumers, perhaps the Australian obsession with interest rates is keeping us from having an even more important discussion on our economic future. Interest rates alone are not the potential saviour, or otherwise, of our economy.For many, that saviour is productivity. As one of the world’s best-known economists (if that is not a contradiction in terms!), Nobel prize winner Paul Krugman,famously said, “productivity isn’t everything but, in the long run, it is almost everything”.Butproductivity has been decliningacross almost all countries including Australia, other than the US, for a number of years now. That means our standard of living is also lower.Australia is no longer the “lucky country”, able to rely on commodities alone to pay our way. One in four Australiansreceive “most” of their incomefrom government (and one in two receive some form of support), which is a sobering figure.In response, the Australian government will hold an Economic Reform Roundtable over three days later this month. The topics up for debate and discussion include all the usual suspects for this type of event, such as tax and budget reform, regulation, competition, skills, AI and innovation.However,the agendagives each of these topics less than three hours each. Even with invites to participate scarcer than hens’ teeth, this is hardly sufficient time for breakthroughs in policymaking.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even three weeks would be unlikely to build consensus between policy wonks, business and unions, let alone three days or three hours. But that is not the point.The greater aim of this gabfest, perhaps, is to arouse conversations at the kitchen table, just as Paul Keating did in 1986, albeit in a far less subtle way, with his “banana republic” comment. Compared to 1986, however, when our current account deficit soared and our dollar sank, it’s hard to pinpoint a similar type of crisis that could spur widespread community support for the reforms we need to make our lives better. Without a bigger (but sustainable) economic pie, we are condemning our kids, and their kids, to worsening living standards.And that should be the trigger for many. That sinking feeling that consumers have every time they go to the supermarket, or even buy a cup of coffee, is a reflection of how our living standards have been shrinking over the past few years. We cannot keep on the same policy pathway and expect our lives to improve.Of course, none of this is easy, and it’s hard to focus on the country’s challenges when our personal challenges seem so great. But we must confront them if we want things to change.I have heard the treasurer say that the government can do big things, slowly. Shifting our focus beyond interest rates to the even greater economic challenges we face today, and building a groundswell of support for reform (beyond those with a seat at the roundtable), is a good place to start that process of change.Nicki Hutley is a consulting economistExplore more on these topicsReserve Bank of AustraliaOpinionInterest ratesAustralian economycommentShareReuse this content"

Scepticism about a wealth tax is rising, but there are many ways to skin fat catsTue 12 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 06.01 EDTShareParoxysms of glee among Labour’s many enemies greeted last week’s forecast of a£41.2bn black holeawaiting Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget, from influential thinktank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). Expect another three months of bone-rattling warnings about imminent tax raids crushing every family. She is in a doom loop; no way out; ha, ha, ha!Voices in the Treasury sound sanguine, pointing out that NIESR has a record of eccentric forecasts. Before the spring statement, it predicted that Reevesneeded £57bnjust to keep her fiscal rules: actually, it was £4.1bn. For Jeremy Hunt as chancellor in 2023, it generously forecast he had£97.5bn to spend: on the day, that had shrunk to £6.5bn.But the truth universally acknowledged (if not publicly by the government) is that taxes must rise. Debt interest costs £100bn a year, growth is nowhere near enough for rising NHS, pensions and welfare costs. Even the right talks of a “brutally honest conversation with the public”: that’s from Robert Colvile, the director of the Centre for Policy Studies, daring to come up withsolutions that would sinkhis party at an election: “No more triple lock. Raising the state pension age … Asking people to pay for their social care out of their housing wealth.” (Quite right, but toxic in Torydom.)Even more surprising, the director of the rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), Tom Clougherty, advocates a tax rise:ending VAT exemptionsto almost double the intake. TheInstitute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) agrees, and has suggested using the billions raised to generously compensate all lower-income households for their extra shopping costs. The IEA would compensate the losers, but spend the rest on cutting income tax. Counterintuitively, the great bulk of these untargeted VAT exemptions reward highest spenders – Waitrose not Iceland shoppers.There is a new honesty about tax and spend among the serious. Hunting for easy money is becoming a national game. The rising clamour for wealth taxes springs from what everyone knows: the rich have gained monstrously from an economy that propels the upward redistribution of wealth. The 50 wealthiest UK families ownmore than the poorest halfof the population, says a report from the Equality Trust. Much billionaire wealth comes from the ownership of property and financial assets, not “entrepreneurial spirit”, inflated deliberately by a decade of quantitative easing. The inheritocracy dominates.Time to reach in and take some back. TheTax Justice Networkwants a 2% levy on wealth over £10m, raising £24bn a year, strongly backed byOxfam,Dale Vinceand thePatriotic Millionaires UKcampaign. The publicagrees, by 75% to 13% against. Naturally, the great wealth-protection machine is in overdrive. The consultancy Henley & Partners claims that 16,500 UK millionaires are fleeing, quoted everywhere as gospel truth, but has beencomprehensively questionedin a thorough report by Dan Neidle of Tax Policy Associates. Henley is a company thatfacilitates citizenship and residencyfor a wealthy clientele. But the narrative is out there: Labour has caused a tax flight.However, Neidle, no rightwinger,issues warningsabout wealth taxes. Wealth is now grotesquely agglomerated among very, very few, so 80% of wealth tax revenue would come from just 5,000 people and 15% from just 10 people. That makes the tax “uniquely vulnerable” to a handful who are gaming valuations or quitting Britain. Unless every country did it, he warns a regular levy would deter inward investors. The IFS isequally sceptical. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, rudely dismisses the whole idea as “daft”.The gambling industry is a licence to print money. Tax it properly – and turbocharge the fight against child poverty | Gordon BrownRead moreDoes that mean it’s dead? Not necessarily, as otherLabourfigures, talking to the Treasury team, put forward ideas privately that have wind in their sails. An instant retrospective wealth-tax raid to raise money urgently for that 5% GDP pledged for national defence has backing, I hear from those talking to the Treasury. Demanding a one-off whack for the defence of the realm could be popular and practicable. What’s more, howls of protest from the wealthy would help rebrand Labour usefully as both socially just and patriotic.There are many ways to skin fat cats, using existing taxes. Here isthe listfrom the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation: the big tax-raisers are £16.7bn from equalising capital gains and income tax rates, treating all income the same. But look how craftily the rich defend themselves: private equity lobbyingjust wona very quiet reprieve to keep disguising earned income as low-taxed capital gain. Running rings around the taxman, someescape inheritance taxon precious art works by promising to make them accessible to the public and then failing; some have even been sold. At least Labour ishiring 5,000 HMRC staff, cut by the Tories despite collecting many multiples of their salaries.Everyone needs the services that national insurance symbolises: it should be paid on all incomes, for landlords, shareholders and investments. Nor will taxing the rich be enough: income tax can’t be taboo, never raised since Denis Healey in 1975, as “drastic times call for drastic action”, writes Paul Johnson, the recently departed IFS director. Property is grossly undertaxed: be brave and reform council tax into a fairer land-value tax.What is certain is that promises will be broken, taxes raised and the faux row will be equally ear-splitting whether Reeves takes a lot or a little. So go for radicalism; the country needs it – for defence, health, old age, decayed infrastructure and green power. Roll the pitch now, prepare the way, and change the moral climate on the tax deniers and avoiders.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTax and spendingOpinionLabourRachel ReevesThe super-richcommentShareReuse this content"

Holding cardboard signs drawn in bright felt-tip pen (“save our kids”), the “pink protest” marched under the banner of protecting women and girls.The crowd may have looked a novel sight, but it points to a rationale that is increasingly gaining ground this summer: asylum seekers are a danger to British women and girls.While the hundreds of protesters across the country – both peaceful and violent – share different motivations, there is a consistent sense that “foreigners” are a threat at best economically and culturally, and at worst physically and sexually. Theongoing unrestoutside the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex was first sparked after an Ethiopian asylum seeker was charged with the alleged sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl, an accusationhe has formally denied. Look at any of the towns and cities that have since seen protests – from Newcastle toBallymena– and the far right, already having hijacked anger over the Rotherham grooming gangs scandal, are organising online underslogans such as“For our children, for our future”. Within days of the first Canary Wharf march, a group in Hampshire announcedtheir own “pink protest”for – as they tweeted – “the safety of women and children in the community”.Such ideas are not consigned to the fringes of the far right or a few local groups: they are being employed – and encouraged – by mainstream news outlets and politicians. As the new wave of protests kicked off, the Mail on Sunday ran an investigation into the number of asylum seekers who “have repaid the generosity of British taxpayers by committing serious offences”, including rape and sexual assault.Such exposés have quickly widened from targeting men on “small boats” to migrants generally, with the two groups often blurred. The Times recently ran a front page warning one in eight prisoners are now born overseas, with the number convicted of sexual and violent crimes increasing. That the data shows that one in six residents of England and Wales areborn outside the UK– and therefore migrants are actually underrepresented in prisons, despite being more likely to be held on remand – was, funnily enough, not mentioned.View image in fullscreenMeanwhile, the Conservatives and Reform UK are increasingly confident in linking immigration to crime. On Sunday, shadow justice secretaryRobert Jenrick saidasylum seekers with “medieval attitudes” coming to Britain mean he is afraid for the safety of his three young daughters. Last month, Nigel Farage explicitly claimed increased migrationwas responsiblefor a rise in the number of rapes and sexual assaults in the UK, pointing to arrivals from – as he put it – “countries in which women aren’t even second-class citizens”. It seems those so-calledlegitimate concernsnow include the fear that asylum seekers are coming over here to rape our women and girls.It would be easy for the government to dispel such myths by making the facts around sexual violence clear. But when I asked the Home Office if it collects data on criminal offences by asylum seekers, it declined to provide any formal comment. When I asked the Home Office if it would like to put on record that – as was confirmed to me by several refugee and women’s charities – there are no official figures that show asylum seekers are more likely to commit sexual offences than British nationals, it did not respond. It was, however, keen to stress it has just released data about foreign nationals (a term that includes many others who are not asylum seekers) in prisons.This ambiguity – and outright radio silence – is unhelpful to say the least, but it is also a choice. Tim Naor Hilton, the chief executive of Refugee Action, outlined the facts in black and white. “There is no clear or credible evidence that people seeking asylum commit more crimes, and any data suggesting that must be viewed in the context of systemic bias, including in policing.”Ministers could say the same, but they do not. The net effect is a vacuum that bad actors are left to fill with bigotry andmisinformation, conflating asylum, migration and criminality to falsely portray asylum seekers – many of whom will be victims of abuse and torture themselves – as a potential danger to the British people. Just look to Warwickshire, where the leader of the Reform-led county council isaccusing policeof a “cover up” over the immigration status of two men charged with the alleged rape of a local child (police vehemently deny that). The vacuum always gets filled: on Saturday, the far rightmarched outside council offices in Nuneaton, with crowds shouting officers were “protecting paedophiles”.What we are seeing is in many ways an extension of the centuries-old racial prejudice that ethnic minorities are a sexual threat to white females (and the white males who claim possession of them). But it is also part of a wider negative depiction of asylum seekers – a narrative that says they are dishonest, greedy and criminal. Think of the spurious stories that child refugees are, in fact, devious adultspretending to be children. Is it any wonder a new YouGov poll shows nearly half of Britons wrongly believe thatillegal migrants now outnumberthose here legally? The same forces that wish to disproportionately associate asylum seekers or migrants with sexual assaults have quite successfully sold the lie that they have already committed a crime by being in the country.Just as we saw with the unrest after the Southport murders last summer, all of this not only inflames racial tensions – it distracts from the very real epidemic of gender-based violence. Few of the politicians or pundits concerned about so-called small boat “perverts” ever mention the crisis of, say,rape trial backlogsor funding cuts for domestic violence refuges. Some protesters will feel genuine worry for the safety of local women. For others, tackling male violence is only desirable if those males are migrants or asylum seekers. Indeed, many involved in the Southport disturbances were perpetrators themselves: two in five people arrested for last year’s riots hadpreviously been reported for domestic violence.There is no clear way out of this when the two main parties are busy in a race to the bottom: as of this week, Labour is pondering letting police release theethnicity or immigration statusof criminal suspects, while the Conservatives have suggested authorities should “swab and track” asylum seekers arriving on small boats – effectively storing their DNA on the assumption they may commit crimes in the future.It feels a dark kind of summer, in which prejudice is dressed in fuchsia and the political class shrug their shoulders while the angry mob grows. We are often told that newcomers to these shores refuse to adopt “British values”, but perhaps those stoking the public’s worst instincts can remember one themselves: in this country, people are innocent until proven guilty. That includes asylum seekers too.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist. She is the author ofWho Wants Normal?

I was tapping away on a Remington typewriter to tell the story of a corrupt state government with an autocratic leader, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen.Technology quickly evolved.

We need to learn about its biases – and outsmart the algorithm | Tracey SpicerRead moreDuring the subsequent decades, notepad and pen sufficed in rural areas of Kenya, Bangladesh and India for TV reports on female foeticide, child marriage and sex trafficking.My latest book, which is about artificial intelligence discriminating against people from marginalised communities, was composed on an Apple Mac.Whatever the form of recording the first rough draft of history, one thing remains the same: they are very human stories – stories that change the way we think about the world.A society is the sum of the stories it tells. When stories, poems or books are “scraped”, what does this really mean?The definition of scraping is to “drag or pull a hard or sharp implement across (a surface or object) so as to remove dirt or other matter”.A long way from Brisbane or Bangladesh, in the rarefied climes of Silicon Valley, scrapers are removing our stories as if they are dirt.These stories are fed into the machines of the great god: generative AI. But the outputs – their creations – are flatter, less human, more homogenised. ChatGPT tells tales set in metropolitan areas in the global north; of young, cishet men and people living without disability.We lose the stories of lesser-known characters in remote parts of the world, eroding our understanding of the messy experience of being human.Where will we find the stories of 64-year-old John from Traralgon, who died from asbestosis? Or seven-year-old Raha from Jaipur, whose future is a “choice” between marriage at the age of 12 and sexual exploitation?OpenAI’s creations are not the “machines of loving grace” envisioned in the 1967 poem byRichard Brautigan, where he dreams of a “cybernetic meadow”.Scraping is a venal money grab by oligarchs who are – incidentally – scrambling to protect their own intellectual property during an AI arms race.The code behind ChatGPT is protected by copyright, which is considered to be a literary work. (I don’t know whether to laugh or cry.)Meta has already stolen the work ofthousands of Australian writers.Now, our own Productivity Commission is consideringweakening our Copyright Actto include an exemption for text and data mining, which may well put us out of business.In its response,The Australia Instituteuses the analogy of a car: “Imagine grabbing the keys for a rental car and just driving around for a while without paying to hire it or filling in any paperwork. Then imagine that instead of being prosecuted for breaking the law, the government changed the law to make driving around in a rental car legal.”It’s more like taking a piece out of someone’s soul, chucking it into a machine and making it into something entirely different.

But silencing their voices won’t stem international outrageTue 12 Aug 2025 13.41 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 13.59 EDTShareAnas al-Sharif knew that far from offering protection amid the slaughter in Gaza, his press credentials further endangered him. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)warned last monthof acute danger to the 28-year-old’s life as the Israel Defense Forces stepped up online attacks on him. These were not merely smears, but a death threat in response to his coverage, the Al Jazeera reporter said. And now he is dead, one of five media workerskilled in an airstrikeon Sunday.The CPJ says thatmore than 180 Palestinian journalists and media workershave been killed in almost two years of war – more than the number who have died globally in the previous three years. This does not merely reflect Gaza’s vast death toll – 61,599, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry and many more if independent experts are correct. Nor does it merely reflect the courage shown by reporters, photographers, camera operators and others in a war zone. The CPJ says 26 of the reporters were targeted.Israeli officials have bragged of killing Mr Sharif, whom they have claimed was the head of a Hamas terrorist cell, planning rocket attacks against Israeli civilians. Mr Sharif and Al Jazeera had already denied this. It would surely be hard for such a prominent figure to combine reporting with command of such a unit. The documents offered up by Israel as evidence end two years before the war began, and were reportedlyscreen grabs of electronic spreadsheets, not independently verified.Israeli officials have repeatedly offered wildly misleading and rapidly shifting accounts of events, includingthe killing of paramedics in Gazathis spring. In 2023, an IDF general reportedly told American officials within hours thatone of its soldiers had probably shot deadthe acclaimed Palestinian-AmericanAl Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Aklehin the occupied West Bank – but Israeli officials insisted publicly that Palestinian militants were to blame. No justification has even been attempted for the deaths of Mr Sharif’s colleagues.Mr Sharif’s 90-year-old father was killed in an airstrike on their home in late 2023, after Israeli military officials called the journalist telling him to stop reporting and leave Gaza. Israeli claims that he was a Hamas fighter resurfaced last month after hisemotional reporting on starvationwent viral. He was killed as outrage mounted over Gaza’s famine and shortly after Israelannounced its plan to launch a groundoffensive in Gaza City, which would only deepen the catastrophe and is reportedly opposed by many in the military too. The deaths of the Al Jazeera team in the city ensure few are left to bear witness to what unfolds. International correspondents are unable to enter Gaza except on escorted military trips during which they cannot speak to Palestinians.Sheltered by the US, Israel’s government appears unmoved as international public opinion turns against it andeven staunch allies blenchat the horrors of Gaza. The Al Jazeera killings have been widely and rightly condemned. The Reporters sans Frontières group has alsourged the international criminal courtto investigate the treatment of media workers.“If these words reach you, know that Israel has succeeded in killing me and silencing my voice,” Mr Sharifwrotein a posthumously published statement. Deliberately targeting journalists is a war crime: an assault not only on the person, but on truth itself. Yet it cannot disguise Israel’s other atrocities. Rather, it adds to the charge sheet against its leaders.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They stand near Blackfriars Bridge as imposing bookends, rising almost 10 metres, folded in places to form platforms and benches, slipping down in others to become one with the pavement. Water trickles from the summit of one huge slab, running down ridges and splashing into a sunken pool. Another pair rise straight out of the river wall, hoisting wooden fenders with them from the swirling brown waters below.“I wanted to make something that comes from nowhere,” says Scottish artist Nathan Coley, as he clamberson to one of his concrete blocks, which form part of the most prominent new public artwork in Britain’s capital, set to be unveiled next month. “They are chunky, abstract, brooding objects that don’t reference anyone or anything. They can be joyful, beautiful and brutal at the same time.”I was asked if I could make the sewer chimneys resemble trees, like they do with phone mastsColey is better known forhis big illuminated signs, but there may be a good reason he didn’t want his sculptures to reference their subject this time. His slabs are the most visible part of the Tideway project, London’s £4.6bn super sewer, built to prevent 18m tonnes of sewage overflowing into the river each year. These enigmatic structures are, in effect, memorials to the era of flushing fecal matter straight into the Thames. “The thing about the super sewer,” Coley says, “is that it’s all hidden. So no one knows where they’re spending all this money. I wanted to make something really exciting to celebrate it.”View image in fullscreen‘Chunky, abstract, brooding’ … one of Nathan Coley’s Stages on Bazalgette Embankment.Photograph: Chris HopkinsonThere has been much talk of Tideway’s spiralling budget and endless delays, itsquestionable usefulness, and itsboss’s pay. But little attention has been given to the fact that a consequence of this costly pipe is a series of new, truly public spaces on the river, for the first time in a generation.One of the seven spaces created as a happy byproduct of the sewer is the 250-metre long stretch where we’re standing: a broad granite expanse dotted with trees, benches and Coley’s black slabs.From Putney in the west to Deptford in the east, Tideway’s meandering 25km path has necessitated the construction of new bits of land, poking out into the Thames to connect the existing overflow sewers (or “lost rivers” to the romantically inclined) to the new tunnel below. Totalling more than three acres, the spaces vary in size according to the volume of waste that must be intercepted and sent whooshing on its way in a spiralling vortex down huge new drop shafts – all of which happens beneath the neatly paved plazas.“They are essentially giant manhole covers,” saysRoger Hawkins of Hawkins\\Brown, the architects responsible for the five central spaces, from Chelsea Embankment to Blackfriars, that together make up the size of Trafalgar Square. “In an ideal world for the engineers, they would be fenced-off compounds that they could easily access. But instead, Tideway decided to create new public spaces, in just the same way that the original embankments were given back to the public in return for the disruption that was caused.”BeforeJoseph Bazalgettebuilt the Victorian network of sewers in the 1860s, London met the Thames with a muddy, sewage-soaked foreshore. The construction of the sewers led to the creation of the embankments: great brick and stone feats of engineering that introduced stately, tree-lined riverside promenades for the first time. Stroll along Victoria Embankment today and you will find the original cast-iron benches held up by sphinxes and camels, lamp-posts supported byentwined dolphins, and ornate sewer ventilation chimneys, or “stink pipes”, in the form of stylised doric columns. So how do Tideway’s contemporary equivalents compare?View image in fullscreenSoftened edge … Chelsea Quay, which will become part-flooded during high tide.Photograph: Rob ParrishThe separation of architecture and engineering in the ensuing 160 years, along with the rise of bureaucratic procurement systems, has led to somewhat more fragmented results. “Tideway was a totally engineering-led project,” says a member of the team who has worked on it for the last decade. “When you’re sitting in meetings with a couple of hundred civil engineers, they see the architecture and landscape as a kind of fluff on top.”Accordingly, the results feel less tied together by a unifying Bazalgettian hand than pieced together by committees with catalogues – something one artist involved describes as “Screwfixation”. Service and inspection requirements mean the pavements have become hymns to the manhole cover, peppered with innumerable service hatches for sewer buggies, drones and probes. One site features 55 hatches in an area half the size of a tennis court. The spaces are not all yet fully complete and open, but they have the slight sense of engineering that has been tiled with a coating of architecture, and garnished with public art.View image in fullscreenSuper structure … a civil engineer inside the concrete tunnel, during construction of the Tideway project.Photograph: Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty ImagesStill, there are some striking flourishes. One of the most consistent, recognisable elements, which help give the project a kind of site-wide identity, are the distinctiveblack cast-iron ventilation shafts. These modern-day stink pipes look like the funnels of submerged ships, twisting and flaring out as they rise to five metres, their form mimicking the path of the plummeting sewage vortex.“At one point, I was asked if I could make them look like trees, in the way they disguise mobile phone masts,” says Clare Donnelly, Tideway’s lead architect at Fereday Pollard, the firm in charge of coordinating the foreshore structures. “You don’t want to scream ‘sewer pipe’ at people, but we wanted them to be confident features in the landscape, not trying to hide.” Softening their heft, the funnels are inscribed withgnomic lines of poetry by Dorothea Smartt, alluding to the various lost rivers being intercepted below the pavement. “The furious Fleet flows red with Roman blood,” declares a chimney at Blackfriars. “Boudica battles bravely.”There are other contextual nods. At Chelsea, in front of the Royal hospital, the brick river wall has been extended out in a sinuous sweep to form a swelling, brick-paved space defined by stepped seating, incorporating colourful stripes ofglazed bricks by artist Florian Roithmayr. You enter through a gap in Bazalgette’s original river wall, which has been radically sliced open, with the cut granite left pleasingly raw.View image in fullscreenRow your boat … a sculpture marks the start point of the boat race at the new Putney Embankment.Photograph: Stewart Turkington“We were thinking about the alluvial geology of the river,” says Marko Neskovic, partner at Hawkins\\Brown, “imagining the beach popping up and allowing you to walk on it, as if it was an eroding island.” The wall rises from the river in banded strata, stepping back as it climbs to form little planted intertidal terraces, with grooves for aquatic life to shelter. A tempting staircase leads down to the water, although it is sadly fenced off. The architects had hoped they could provide access to the beach for mudlarkers, but the Port of London authority (controller of the Thames) vetoed the idea on safety grounds. Officially, the steps are therefore an escape route, rather than an access point.Despite the guidance to treat the river as foe, the architects have tried where they can to soften the relationship with the water. Most of the spaces slope subtly up towards the flood defence line, so you can see the Thames more easily rather than it being blocked behind the river wall. A foot-wetting frisson can also be had thanks to the incorporation of “floodable terraces”, which get splashed when big boats pass at high tide. Elsewhere, great iron mooring rings, grasped between lions’ teeth, are now surreally marooned inland, giving you a sense of transgressing beyond the river wall.View image in fullscreen‘A workingman’s cushion’ … Richard Wentworth’s cast bronze sandbag.Photograph: Courtesy the artistWhile Chelsea opts for organic curving brick, the space at Victoria Embankment,known as Tyburn Quay, is a more sober granite plaza raised on a square plinth, reflecting the formal surrounds of Westminster. A faintly Miesian pavilion will house kiosks for a cafe and loos, its stone walls inscribed with the profile of Bazalgette’s sewer, while an inlaid ring of bronze in the ground marks the location of the gigantic drop shaft below the paving. “We tried to incorporate lots of things you could enjoy if you were a river buff,” says Hawkins\\Brown’s Fiona Stewart. “Like using ductile iron in the paving at Blackfriars, to reference the iron deposits at the source of the Fleet.” Budding psychogeographers will rejoice.The artist commissions bring further intrigue, from a forthcoming flotilla of trading vessels byHew Locke in Tower Hamlets, to playful plinths byStudio Weave in Deptford, to Claire Barclay’s cast bronze oar balustrades in Putney,marking the starting point of the University Boat Race. Tyburn Quay’s grey granite decorum has been cheekily disrupted by Richard Wentworth, who has installed a series ofcast bronze sandbags, which droop in haphazard piles over the stone steps, alluding to makeshift flood defences. “It’s a workingman’s cushion,” says Wentworth, who has long celebrated the national culture of make-do-and-mend. “I hope the sandbags will get shiny where people sit on them. And they’re a little bit erotic. You can feel that someone might propose here.”His saucy sacks are under wraps until the space opens later this year, but the texture of the hessian has been meticulously recreated in bronze by the Lockbund sculpture foundry in Oxfordshire, which is also producing his bronze benches for Albert Embankment, near the MI6 headquarters. In an allusion to the Vauxhall origins of sanitaryware manufacturer Royal Doulton, Wentworth has designed seatingin the form of conjoined loos. “I think there’s something nice about sitting on the toilet with lots of other people,” he says. “It reminds you that pooing is public.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureThames WaterPublic services policyEngineeringPublic landsInfrastructurefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Partly, of course, it was a touching nod to her late friend, the comic Janey Godley. Godley’sviral Twitter voiceoversof the first minister of Scotland’s press conferences always ended with the catchphrase: “Frank, get the door!”As a reporter covering her decade in power, however, I’d always found her to be a master of the lengthy, lawyerly obfuscation and the disarming but consequence-free apology. Would she really engage with the questions that overshadowed the final years of her leadership until her shock resignation in 2023? Questions about Alex Salmond’s sexual harassment investigation, the Scottish government’s secrecy during the pandemic, the toxic legacy of her gender recognition reforms, the stalled delivery of some of her flagship policy pledges, not to mention independence itself. And what about that rumoured lesbian affair?With her ex-husband, former SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, currently awaiting trial for alleged embezzlement of party funds, that topic is rendered conveniently off-limits under contempt of court rules. But that doesn’t mean readers will be able to dispel from their minds images of the famous blue police tent planted in her garden. Following her own arrest and release without charge in June 2023, she remained subject to investigation as part of the probe into SNP finances for almost two years. This book was written during those dark days (she was formally told there would be no further action in March this year).She reveals she came close to having a breakdown after giving evidence at the UK Covid inquiryBut first, Frankly takes us back to a council flat in the former mining village of Dreghorn, Ayrshire. There, a young Nicola identified with tomboyish George from the Famous Five, worried constantly about her dad joining the swelling ranks of the unemployed, and broke up with her primary school best friend because she wanted to spend more time on her homework. She identifies the fundamental contradiction that would propel her: “Alongside shyness, crippling lack of confidence and a dreadful fear of failure was a burning ambition, a drive to succeed, a craving to be ‘seen’.”It’s a psychic schism that is evident throughout the book. When she starts canvassing as a teenager, “somehow the girl who found it almost impossible to chat with people she knew was able to stand on the doorsteps of complete strangers and ask them to vote SNP”. And later, as Sturgeon and her party soared in popularity after the 2014 independence referendum, she became “scared that my public persona was now so far removed from my private self that I wouldn’t be able to live up to her”. One is left in no doubt about the sheer force of will required to beNicola Sturgeon, and how very good she became at hiding that struggle.There are some moments of bracing honesty. She reveals she came close to having a breakdown after giving evidence at the UK Covid inquiry. It was intolerable to her “being confronted with everything my worst critics wanted people to believe of me”. I can’t think of another politician of her stature who’d describe themselves on the floor of their home office, gripped by a panic attack as they struggled to edit a crucial policy document – in this case the Scottish government’s white paper on independence. And a lengthy passage on her pregnancy loss, in which she writes about her lingering guilt and shares the name she had chosen for the baby, Isla, is almost unbearably intimate.As you might expect from a book-lover like Sturgeon, she is an entertaining storyteller, with a good eye for detail – such as the relief she felt on discovering a dead fly in her restaurant meal at her first SNP conference, meaning she didn’t have to pay for it from the £40 her cash-strapped parents had given her to last the weekend. She also enjoys a plot twist: after a thorough take-down of the much-recycled rumour that she had an affair with the female French ambassador, she writes that “the nature of the insult was water off a duck’s back … I have never considered sexuality, my own included, to be binary”.It’s startling to read her account of the tension and hostility she claims characterised her relationship with Alex Salmond long before the public split that resulted from her government’s handling of sexual harassment allegations made against him by two civil servants. (These later formed part of his criminal trial on 13 counts of sexual assault, of which he was acquitted in March 2020.) The pattern of behaviour she lays out – bouncing her into standing for parliament before she felt ready, overriding her concerns about releasing the Lockerbie bomber on compassionate grounds, taunting her about her caution on pushing for another independence referendum – comes across as little short of bullying.Of course this cannot be tested against Salmond’s own recollection because of his sudden death last October, and will further infuriate those who believe those sexual assault allegations were a conspiracy confected by Sturgeon and her allies, a theory she takes apart piece by piece.She says she “agonised” about “stirring up pain for his wife and family” but concluded “I cannot let what he said stand unchallenged”. It’s a trade-off that makes sense from someone who recognises what an “increasingly polarising figure” she had become – indeed anything she writes now will be understood from whichever side of the various fissures readers locate themselves on, be they Scottish independence, Alex Salmond or gender.On that issue she also stands her ground: where plenty of others have shifted position since the supreme court ruling on biological sex, she refuses to, while offering her most conciliatory words yet over her “complacency” about other women’s worries. What’s clear is the utter discombobulation she felt at having been earlier feted as a role model - “living up to the honour of being the first female incumbent of my office became almost an obsession”, she writes - only to be decried by some gender critical campaigners as a “destroyer of women’s rights”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Right enough, but there are also legitimate questions about how someone in a position of power and leadership could be so ignorant of someone as close to her as Salmond was. Neither does she explain why the women who brought the original harassment complaints against Salmond described being left without any support by the Scottish government she led.She fails to reflect on how having a married couple at the very top of the SNP for more than a decade impacted the party, encouraging the apparently lax governance so many colleagues complained about. She says she “hated” the cultish focus on her as an individual, particularly after 2015, but doesn’t explain why it was allowed to continue. Nor does she address the lack of succession planning for her eventual departure.Despite the book’s promise of candour, it seems like Sturgeon is only willing to entertain her readers’ curiosity so far. She writes latterly that “even if I haven’t changed anyone else’s view of me, the process of writing this book has helped me arrive at a more balanced sense of myself”. That may be so, but it doesn’t feel like the whole story.Libby Brooks is the Guardian’s Scotland correspondent. Frankly by Nicola Sturgeon is published by Macmillan (£28).

The bleak, bleak suffering. Katherine Kelly’s desperate drug-smuggling thriller – featuring distressing scenes set in a Bulgarian prison – is so claustrophobic it’s suffocatingLucy ManganTue 12 Aug 2025 11.18 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 12.13 EDTShareIwonder, sometimes, if Katherine Kelly misses her days as Becky McDonald in Coronation Street. Yes, Becky was a once-homeless, thieving ex-con who worked her way through the full panoply of soap storylines (abuse, miscarriage, drink problem, buying a child, marrying Steve, smashing up Tracy Barlow’s front room with a sledgehammer, a stint in the Rovers Return) before her departure from the cobbled streets for a new life in Barbados after a triumphant wedding-reception-wrecking, but, y’know, she got to have a laugh while she was doing it.This was during the early 00s, when Coronation Street still dealt in comedy as well as tragedy, recognising them as two sides of the same life coin, especially among the barmaids – fully formed or embryonic battleaxes all – gazing out on the world and its punters as they wearily pulled pints behind the bar.Since then, Kelly’s output has largely been one of unrelenting grimness. I can’t remember the last time she took a main role in anything that required a lightness of touch, let alone the exercise of her comic chops. And never more so than in her latest outing, the exhausting six-part thriller In Flight, in which she plays a desperate single mother, Joanne, whose son, Sonny, is sentenced to 15 years in a Bulgarian prison for a murder he swears he did not commit. Oh God, the suffering! The bleak, bleak suffering!Joanne sits opposite her boy as he cries and gibbers at the thought of spending years – if he is not shanked by breakfast time – in the terrifying hellhole run by thugs (it is safe to say that the Bulgarian tourist board will not be happy with In Flight). She goes home and trawls through his case files again, in preparation for a hearing that promises to be just as unsuccessful as all the others.It is almost a relief when the thriller proper begins; give me raw suspense over emotional battery any day. Joanne, a long-haul flight attendant, is approached by a menacing man called Cormac (Stuart Martin) and presented with a non-opportunity: start smuggling drugs for the cartel he represents and get her son protected in prison – albeit at the risk of life imprisonment or the death penalty herself, depending on whether she gets caught and in which country – or refuse and get him killed. Cormac hands her a suitcase with a false bottom, tips on how to disguise the smell of the heroin she is told to pick up in Istanbul, and vanishes into the night after warning her not to tell anyone.She tells Dominic (Ashley Thomas). He is a customs officer and they had a thing while he was separated from his wife. He is now back with his wife and trying to make a go of things, but he and Joanne still gaze at each other yearningly across the baggage carousel.Thus the stage is set for – well, hours of ordinary people being terrorised into acts of increasingly inventive desperation, really. There are lots of set pieces ratcheting up the tension as Joanne is nearly caught in the act again and again and kilos of drugs have to be hidden in tampon dispensers.Ambiguous conversations are held and more and moren trusted folk turn out to be corrupt horrors; you would simply give anything to make it stop. Partly so Joanne and Sonny’s anguish can end, partly so yours can.I don’t know if this counts as a successful thriller or not. Clearly, it works to the extent that the viewer is invested enough to be discomfited along with the characters. Equally clearly, the choking airlessness of it all is … not entertaining, especially with a script that dispenses necessary information in as unadorned a manner as possible.But I am a coward when it comes to the drug-smuggling thriller format. I feel as if I am being forced to watch a dog chew off its own leg to escape from a trap. But for those who love precisely that about it, In Flight will be a classic of the genre: the claustrophobic nature of it all, the endangerment of hapless innocents and the reminder of the evil that spreads untrammelled across space and history are a cluster of superb selling points. It’s brisk, it’s well made, it’s entirely harrowing. I wish you your strange, strange joy of it.In Flight airs on Channel 4 and is available online nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

She had just performed aTed talkabout the future of comedy and was heading home to the US, when someone she thought worked for airport security quizzed her about her visit.Thinking he was probing for visa infringements, “I just said I was doing comedy. Then he asked: ‘What do you joke about?’ Stupidly, I lightly flirted with him, and was like: ‘Everything other than airport security!’ He didn’t react at all. Then I realised he was US border control. He asked again: ‘What do you joke about?’”Friedman is a veteran of The Daily Show and The Late Show, and her standup comedy often features excoriating routines at the expense of the political establishment. “I just froze because I am a political comedian and I didn’t know what to say. Then he said: ‘Do you joke about politicians?’”She made it home, but the incident stuck with her. Friedman lives in LA, and the recent actions of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement “detaining anyone and everyone who looks a certain way” put her on high alert. “It was such a quick, on its face benign, interaction,” she says. “But it did feel like a scene out of The Handmaid’s Tale. I’m a blonde, white woman who looks like a Republican’s wife and I have an American passport. But what if I had said ‘Yes?’ Don’t we want to live in a country where we can joke about politicians, where we can joke about anything?”View image in fullscreen‘Don’t we want to live in a country where we can joke about politicians?’ … Jena Friedman.Photograph: Peacock/Heidi Gutman/Getty ImagesFriedman incorporated that moment into her new standup show, Motherf*cker, which she’s performing at the Edinburgh fringe. The show is a change of pace. She’s generally resisted getting personal on stage, resenting the idea that women have to be relatable to succeed in comedy, but this time it felt unavoidable, as she explores the life-changing experience of becoming a parent while her own mother was dying. “It’s about grief, but it’s also political,” she says. “The vibe in certain circles does feel like we’re grieving. So there’s something about my show that’s connecting to the larger moment.”Friedman is among a crop of US comedians with roots in topical comedy appearing at this year’s fringe. Another stalwart of US political comedy, Michelle Wolf, is back, too, while standup and former Saturday Night Live writer Sam Jay is making her festival debut.Wolf earned her stripes on The Daily Show and Late Night with Seth Myers, and gained notoriety with her 2018 set at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, in whichshe roasted Trump and his collaborators. These days, she lives in Barcelona, although returns to the US regularly for comedy work. She’s yet to encounter border trouble but, with reports of people with green cards and citizens being detained, she says: “I’m keeping an eye on it.”Comedians Rosie O’Donnell and Ellen DeGeneres have both said that the state ofUS politicshas forced them out of the country – O’Donnell to Ireland and DeGeneres to England. O’Donnell has written a show on just that, which she performed for the first week of the fringe. Wolf is happy with her move to Barcelona, and feels her comedy has benefited from other cultural perspectives, but returns to the US because “the audiences are great” and there’s plenty of work. While other US comedians have also discussed the idea of moving to Europe, she thinks it won’t happen until there’s “an impetus to go, something I don’t think is far off, like: you can’t talk about this any more, you can’t talk about that any more”.Last month, satirist Stephen Colbert announced that networkCBS had cancelled The Late Showafter 33 years. Many thought the timing, three days on from Colbert criticising CBS parent company Paramount for settling a lawsuit with Donald Trump, was suspect. Fellow late-night talkshow host Jon Stewartcriticised the moveon his podcast and pointed to wider fear across the industry.: “There are a lot of things that will never be made, that you will never know about, that will be killed in the bed before they ever had a chance because of this chilling effect.”Friedman’s glad to see Colbert and Stewart speaking out against Trump and his administration – and agrees there’s a “chill”. “The industry has already been less supportive of political comedy than they were under Biden and Obama. However, “seeing the most prominent comedians taking [Trump] to task, likeMatt [Stone] and Trey [Parker] from South Park, Colbert and Stewart, that gives me hope”.View image in fullscreenMichelle Wolf’s standup explores society through the ‘lens of being a mom’.Photograph: Stephen Keable/AlamyMeanwhile, Michelle Wolf’s standup merges the personal and political and her podcast, Wolf’s Thought Box, tackles current affairs. Her new show, which she’s performing while eight months pregnant at the fringe, explores life and society “through the lens of being a mom now”. There are punchlines on societal pressures for working mothers, home birth, momfluencers, gender inequalities and more. “We’re in an era now where people are talking about motherhood realistically and that’s very refreshing,” she says.Still, political comedy isn’t absent. “I feel like I have to address the whole America and Trump thing … people expect me to say something about it.” She plans to tailor topical jokes to the day’s news but, “I don’t like making it a large part of my set, because it bores me. There’s always something crazy happening, but it’s hard to come up with creative angles other than: can you believe this?”It’s been nine years since she first started writing jokes about Trump and, in that time, her life has transformed – she met her partner, moved abroad, and is about to have her second child. Her main feeling now is: “How are we still talking about him? How are we still in the same spot?”Jay reflects that slow build in her show, We the People, in which she explores the state of America – looking back to the “unconfident whites” who founded the nation. She describes the show as “a fun, risky little ride” as she tries to get to the root of why the US feels so divided, and what we can do to better understand one another. “It’s this broader conversation I’ve been having about America and race,” Jay says.The whole world feels unsettled right now and there’s an inability to consider other perspectives, Jay says. “How did we get here as Americans? Of course, I think race plays a large part in it. And how did these race relations get to the way they are? Not just blaming white people, but exploring the type of white people we’re dealing with, why they might be the way they are, their roots in England.”Trump came up plenty during Jay’s time on SNL and appears in her fringe show as a “braggadocious” fool, unable to keep state secrets, yet smartly appealing to the frustrations of America’s poor white communities. But the conditions that created and elevated Trump are more interesting to Jay: “He’s the symptom of this, not the cause. This is a result of years and years of us doing it wrong … it’s been building for a long time and for a lot of different reasons.”‘TikTok is like an old-school variety show’: what’s behind the surprising boom in ventriloquism?Read moreFriedman agrees: “I started working at the Daily Show in 2012, I was at Letterman before that, so I started looking at politics on a daily basis since 2010, and this is a long time coming.” This also means that, among US audiences, not everyone wants political comedy. “They’re always looking for escapism. In the first term, there was definite Trump fatigue,” Friedman says. “As a political comic, I’ve always done better in the UK than the US. It’s the UK audiences who are like: what the hell’s going on over there?” says Friedman.The mood in US comedy is, Jay says, “the mood in America … chaos. There’s no way to keep up. People are also very desensitised. Shit just keeps happening in more extreme ways that people are losing a metric for it.”All three agree that comedy can help share differing worldviews. “Even if it’s people we disagree with, the sign of a healthy democracy is when people can safely be on stage saying whatever we want, ideally in good faith,” Friedman says. “I support all comedians, I support freedom of expression and I want to see more of it. I want to see people more open to people they disagree with. Whenever I do political comedy, the goal is not to preach to the choir, it’s to get people to see things slightly differently.”Jay has said that comedy can be a tool for empathy. “I look at it as a conversation.

Iestyn Davies, whose Orpheus will be amid the tumblers, dancers and acrobats, writes of pushing boundaries – and heart-stopping wonderIestyn DaviesTue 12 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 12.59 EDTShareOperas tell stories; like all great art, the operas that endure don’t just tell stories – they reshape the way stories can be told. And it takes more than memorable tunes and a finely honed libretto to bring a piece into the hallowed pantheon of the operatic canon. Often it is the challenging of expectations that moves the dial for ever, permitting the art form to evolve, inspire and establish new ways of telling old stories.In my career as a countertenor opera singer I am often to be found singing the works of Handel, a composer whose oeuvre helped to define opera in the first half of the 18th century. Today, we often perform his operas in a style that befits our time; directors such as Katie Mitchell, Barrie Kosky, Richard Jones or Claus Guth push the singing actor far beyond what the famed castrati or prima donnas of Handel’s day were expected to do. And, as I prepare to take on singing Gluck’s opera Orpheus and Eurydice at the Edinburgh international festival I am acutely aware that its success will lie in both the staging and the piece itself. A quarter of a millennium ago Gluck’s work broke new ground by challenging audiences’ expectations. This staging withCircawill do the same.Gluck and his librettist Calzabigi “reformed” opera. They wanted to move towards a noble simplicity and away from arcane plots.They chose for their mission the story of Orpheus and his descent into the underworld to rescue his wife, Eurydice. At its heart then was a character famed for his musical skill, moreover one who played an intrinsic role in the interpretation of classical mythology in western culture. The final piece in their jigsaw was to engage the famous Italian castrato Gaetano Guadagni, who as a young singer had enjoyed great success working in London with Handel. Together with Gluck, Guadagni found a musical language that did away with complex virtuosity – instead of arias that paused to reflect and repeat, as the audiences at the time were used to, it focused on driving the drama forwards.In fact, Guadagni had made many enemies in the London audiences who were said to have hissed his appearance on the stage after his refusal to bow to acknowledge applause (in order to maintain dramatic unity). He also shunned the overindulgence, prevalent at the time, to repeat well-received arias. Most notably, it was his association with the English actor David Garrick that bore fruit in his subsequent collaboration with Gluck.View image in fullscreen‘I will be literally standing on the shoulders of these giants’ … Iestyn Davies on working with Circa.Photograph: Pablo StrongGarrick himself had changed the English stage. Gone were the soliloquies delivered standing stock-still. He dared to move around the stage while talking, gesticulate and, even (rare at the time), listen to the other characters and react to what they said! He was admired for his range of facial expressions and the air of truthfulness he brought to his parts. He worked with Guadagni in London and it is clear that the singer adopted the actor’s innovative stage behaviour.Guadagni’s commitment to playing Orpheus over the span of his later life suggests an empathy with the character brought about by an involvement with the role akin to what we might call method acting. In a break from operatic tradition, themajority of Gluck’s new opera was declamatory in nature, hardly ever pausing to signal a shift from the recitative (the more narrative parts, often sung in the rhythm of speech) to the songs or arias.On stage in Gluck’s new work, Guadagni was noted for his continuous acting throughout; he was praised for the resultant vigour and verisimilitude this brought. This shift would have shocked audiences of the time. In a daring challenge to his colleagues, the castrato no longer put himself first, but rather the character and the story. As a result he was one of the first singers ever to build a career through identification with a single role.It’s a role that I have sung before in concert and on record but not as yet on stage. I associate closely with Guadagni, having performed a number of his parts written for him by Handel, and also in sharing the dubious honour of us both having had racehorses named after us. (Mr Davies’s career was not long, nor distinguished).My countertenor range probably shares many of the qualities of a falsetto singer such as Guadagni. Countertenor voices are often described as “otherworldly” and “ethereal” in sound, and there’s a beautiful, expressive legato to be found throughout Guadagni’s roles that appeals to me. Furthermore, in the past two decades of my career I have relished more than anything else opportunities that give me a chance to be a “singing actor” in the truest sense of the phrase. I learned a great deal from being on stage opposite Mark Rylance in the play Farinelli and the King: the magic he was able to conjure through his tinkering with rhythm and phrasing; dynamic range seemed to be a key attribute to his delivery; and, above all, his constant connection with the audience via an invisible thread that tugged gently at their attention throughout was masterly. I can see a connection to how to play Orpheus, who as a lone character on the stage is so inside of himself, and the subtle way in which actors such as Rylance communicate their thoughts with such transparency.View image in fullscreenHeart-stopping wonder … Opera Queensland’s production of Orpheus and Eurydice in association with Circa.Photograph: Keith SaundersHelping me on this journey is the breathtaking performing arts company Circa together with its artistic director Yaron Lifschitz. At the time of writing I have yet to meet them and my experience of this production has been limited to watching a dress-rehearsal video (the staging premiered in Australia in 2019). But it is not often that I find myself gasping out loud at so many moments of heart-stopping wonder as the acrobats climb, tumble, fall, stretch, dance and cover the stage in a kind of physical expression of the inner machinations of Orpheus’s mind. At certain points, I will be literally standing on the shoulders of these giants and pushing my own boundaries of my stage experience to date.The story transforms from a psychological drama into a living and breathing organism around the two central singersGluck’s opera combined the beauty of singing with the poise and refinement of ballet and there’s no lack of gracefulness in Circa’s often audacious schemes. Indeed, at all times it looks and feels human; I can imagine the excitement Gluck’s Viennese audience would have felt in seeing this new and energetic style when I watch Circa. The story transforms from a psychological drama into a living and breathing organism around the two central singers. The Australian soprano Samantha Clarke, in a twist on tradition, performs both the roles of Eurydice and Amore (Cupid) in director Yaron Liftschitz’s interpretation.When a great opera tells a story well, as Gluck’s Orpheus and Eurydice does, it becomes a piece we can bring back time and time again. And in the hands of an imaginative director, surprises emerge that cast new light on the music in ways you never imagined. I have been lucky enough to be a part of Barrie Kosky’s hit production of Handel’s Saul at Glyndebourne this summer, and what I have learned from it is that when you challenge expectations, and do so with vivid imagination and a sprinkling of audacity fuelled with integrity and commitment, you are more than likely to make people sit up and engage.In Orpheus and Eurydice, Gluck, Calzabigi and Guadagni knew this too.Orpheus and Eurydice (with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and chorus of Scottish Opera) isat Edinburgh Playhousefrom 13-16 August, part of the Edinburgh international festivalExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now they have been turned into an extraordinary playHelen MeanyTue 12 Aug 2025 10.10 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 12.13 EDTShareIn Vasenka, a fictional town under military occupation, a deaf boy is shot by soldiers and the town’s inhabitants become deaf in response. The opening of Deaf Republic – the remarkable second collection by the Ukrainian-American poet and translatorIlya Kaminsky– sets in train a narrative of resistance through silence, as “deafness, an insurgency, begins” and the soldiers start executing the citizens of Vasenka, who refuse to hear their orders.Since its publication in 2019, Deaf Republic has won multiple awards and been critically lauded for what the former poet laureateAndrew Motionhas described as “a folk drama that feels archetypal, yet is deeply revealing of our here and now”. That quality of being current, urgent in its commentary on war yet as timeless as a fable, appealed to Bush Moukarzel and Ben Kidd, co-directors of theatre companyDead Centre, who have adapted the work for stage.“Kaminsky’s genius is to make the reader feel they understand more than they do,” says Kidd in between rehearsals in Dublin. “Yet some of the poems are inscrutable. The choice to use a story, the narrative of what happens to the townspeople, is important. Then he drops in his lyric poems and you’re stopped short. There are two things going on formally, and it suggests itself as a piece that could be adapted.”Kaminsky, who lost his own hearing as a child and did not have hearing aids until he moved to the US in his teens, also incorporates sign language symbols into his text, which are a mixture of American and Ukrainian signs. In the book he wanted to reflect his experience of being an immigrant in the US, while also frequently returning toUkraine.“I was living with one foot in both places,” he says, speaking online from the US. To reflect this, the central narrative is bookended by two poems – We Lived Happily During the War and In a Time of Peace – that echo each other and transpose the image of the body of a dead boy lying on a pavement from the fictional Vasenka to the US today.View image in fullscreen‘There are layers of theatre-within-theatre in it’ ... from left: Kate Finegan, Lisa Kelly, Romel Belcher, Caoimhe Coburn Gray and Eoin Gleeson in rehearsals.Photograph: Johnny Corcoran“What is complicated is seeing these images of violence in one of the poorest countries in Europe [Ukraine] and one of the richest countries in the world,” says Kaminsky. “I realised I needed to change the genre I’m writing in. I needed a genre that speaks to both sides of my life. So the book is a kind of fairytale, it’s dream time, a fantasia. A fairytale was a necessity, to speak about both these landscapes, Ukraine and the US.”British Sign Language is for prose, whereas Visual Vernacular is much closer to poetry“There are layers of theatre-within-theatre in it,” Moukarzel says. “The way it is presented, with the first line ‘Our country is the stage’, the list of dramatis personae of townspeople and the puppet theatre run by the character of Momma Galya, all this adds theatricality. We were intrigued. But we wondered if it was ethical to adapt it: was it our story to tell, especially the deaf experience? That gave us pause. We needed to build the right team.”Thankfully, the two directors have history when it comes topushing boundarieson stage. Their show Beckett’s Room told the story of the apartment in Paris where Samuel Beckett lived with his partner Suzanne during the second world war without using any live actors.In this production there will be an ensemble created from deaf and hearing actors, along with aerial performers, live cinema and poetry, using a mix of spoken English, British Sign Language (BSL), Irish Sign Language and creative captioning. On the day I sat in on a rehearsal, there was also a slightly out of control drone and some beautifully crafted string puppets making a tentative appearance.View image in fullscreen‘I needed a genre that speaks to both sides of my life’ … Ilya Kaminsky.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverWatching keenly was Zoë McWhinney, a deaf poet and actor who co-authored the script with Kidd and Moukarzel. “We gave each other a lot of freedom from the start,” McWhinney says, speaking through an interpreter. She used BSL to work on the rough script, recording herself on video. “In some ways, it is BSL-led, rather than spoken English,” she says. McWhinney also brought in Visual Vernacular (VV) – a form of performance art that draws on sign language, mime and theatre.“BSL is for conversation, for prose, whereas VV is much closer to poetry,” says McWhinney. “There is a rhythm and pace to it. Through gesture and movement, facial expressions, hand movement, you can see the image: you’re almost personifying the language.”For Kaminsky, it was Dead Centre’s innovative approach to adapting nonfiction that appealed to him. “The way they spoke about implicating the audience was fascinating to me. I thought, ‘I’m getting an education here, keep it coming!’ I didn’t want to see a Xerox copy of my book. It’s up to them to create their own art form; otherwise the energy gets stiff. And I want the energy to be electric.”Deaf Republic is atRoyal Court theatre, London, 29 August-13 September, then at the Samuel Beckett theatre, Dublin, 2-5 October, as part ofDublin Theatre festivalExplore more on these topicsTheatreDeafness and hearing lossPoetryPolitical theatreUkraineIrelandRoyal Court theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

What’s been your wildest “yes and” moment?My most memorable “yes and” moment is when I went home to New Orleans, where my friends who I grew up with were spending their weekends breaking into the local zoo and swimming in the tank with the sea lions. Not the seals – the sea lions. We had been out, it was one in the morning, there were many alcoholic beverages involved, and it involved waiting for the security guards to be looking the wrong way, finding the sea lion exhibit, climbing fences and diving in. Apparently when I jumped in, a sea lion had just swam right under me as I was hitting the water. I had no clue.The Baltimorons is a Christmas romcom. What’s your favourite Christmas movie?I have not seen Bad Santa in a very long time, and my instincts are that it’s not OK to love Bad Santa any more, and that it might actually not be a great movie. But I saw Bad Santa at Christmas when it released theatrically, and it was the most explosive, irreverent, exciting antidote to Christmas. Because we would often go to movies on Christmas Day, and you’re just sodonewith Christmas. And this was just destroying Christmas, frame by frame by frame. I loved it at the time – I’ve washed my hands of it now. I don’t want to get cancelled because I liked a movie 20 years ago.You and your brotherwrote a bookabout film-making. What’s the one most important thing you know now that you wish you knew when you were starting out?We have a philosophy: make movies, not meetings. It’s very easy to confuse talking about movies with making movies. And, you know, there’s just so much hemming and hawing and so much thinking and perfectionism. Nothing’s ever going to be perfect. You’re never going to line everything up just right. If you want to make a movie, you need to make a movie. If you don’t, you’re not making movies. It’s that simple.What’s the most chaotic thing that’s ever happened on set?Luckily, I haven’t had anybody get injured on a set – no big real-life stuff. But the scariest thing that I’ve done – and I’ve done it on tiny movies, I’ve done it on big movies – is [say], “Hey everybody, we don’t know what we’re doing right now. Hello, A-list, Oscar-winning actor. I fucked this up, and I don’t know what this is. And what I need to do is take a walk around the block for 20 minutes and figure out what this scene really needs, because what we’re doing right now isn’t going to cut it.”People don’t like that. They want you to always have all the answers and know everything.What film do you always return to, and why?The original Rocky. It’s the best underdog story. It’s got great plotting, the love story is wonderful, it’s moving and so subversive. When I tell people that Rocky is my favourite movie of all time, they’re like, “Oh, God, how can you watch that?” And my reply is always, “Well, who do you think wins?” They’re like, “Obviously Rocky.” And I’m like, “Well, now you need to re-see Rocky. You clearly have not seen that movie,really.” I’ve seen that film probably 20 times.View image in fullscreenDuplass was handpicked by Transparent creator Joey Soloway to play Josh Pfefferman, one of the three siblings who learn their parent is a trans woman.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyWhat are you secretly really good at?I’m secretly really good at doing 14 hours of work inside of a freelance day. That’s probably my biggest superpower. I can teach you how to do it: it’s called the high school schedule. It’s like when you went to high school and you woke up at 7am, got to school at 8am and did seven subjects from 8am to 3pm and then you went and did a sport afterwards, and then you went home and did three hours of homework. I mean, that’s what I did – I went to a Catholic prep school, and that’s how I built my schedule.All of us freelance artists, we are just swimming around in all this time and all this freedom. I don’t have any any more, because I got kids, dogs, a mortgage, a company to run and a bunch of movies and TV shows, but that’s how I do it. At a certain point, I was floundering and just trying to organise myself – I think that’s probably the biggest challenge of every independent artist – and I came up with this idea of a high school schedule, and I just started scheduling every hour. You’re on my high school schedule today: 4pm, do this interview. I was just working on a script right before then, and then my alarm went off. I set alarms. I think it’s my best skill. It’s the same as “make movies” – there is no replacement for just doing tremendous amounts of undeniable work.You studied psychology and were planning to make a career out of it. Care to share any psychological advice?The best single thing that I learned in therapy is: “I’m going to be OK, no matter what.” I’ve dealt with some very challenging things over the course of a 52-year life and once I got on board with this idea that I’m going to be OK no matter what, it’s a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Every day I wake up with anxiety and when I can come back to that place – “I’m going to be OK, no matter what” – and really believe it and know it to be true, it really does change everything. You bring a sense of calm and forward momentum into everything that you’re doing, no matter what the circumstances are.You started acting later in your career in shows like Transparent; what’s the best lesson you learned from working with other actors?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Well, you might not have a choice. Ever since filming on the Anne Hathaway/Meryl Streep reunion commenced in New York a few weeks ago, set photos and accompanyingnews itemshave become plentiful (don’t click that link if you don’t want to know the rumors about a major star). Of course, gossip pages breathlessly reporting casting rumors are not sanctioned by a movie studio, like a teaser, poster, trailer or announcement video. At the same time, the movie hype machine has been blurring the line between genuine marketing and tweet-grade micro-teases all summer long.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For example: is there a teaser trailer for next summer’s Spider-Man: Brand New Day? It’s the next Marvel movie after this July’sFantastic Four reboot, and plenty of summer blockbusters-to-be have called their shots with a teaser a year in advance, so it would make sense to get a little something out there. A teaser is kinda-sorta what Sonyposteda few weeks ago, only it was hyped up as a “suit reveal”, which seems like an attempt to redress a 20-second teaser in literal new clothes. It also seems like a backfire if the strategy involves anyone beyond the most diehard 5% of movie-watchers realizing or caring that Tom Holland walks up to the camera wearing a Spider-Man costume that is slightly different than the six other Spider-Man costumes he’s donned in other appearances. There is also abehind-the-scenes videoof a movie that’s barely started filming. It recalls the absurdly lengthy “chair reveal” ofcast membersfrom Avengers: Doomsday parceled out over five hours, which is getting its own sequel soon. (Not everyone was announced, of course. Not least because the movie’s screenplay was not finished at the time of that announcement and filming commencement.)EvenChristopher Nolan, who has generally mastered the art of keeping his highly anticipated movies to the realm of teasers and trailers – a teaser for his Imax-shot version ofThe Odysseyemerged just about a year before its planned July 2026 release – succumbed to the hype machine when that Odyssey teaser was accompanied by tickets forselect showtimes going on sale. That’s right, if you want to plan a movie outing 50 weeks from now, you can see about booking an Odyssey ticket at your local Imax (if applicable). Or rather, you could have if your AMC app didn’t crash; most of those showings sold out quickly.To some extent, this is business as usual. There’s been year-out hype for movies for literal decades at this point;Alien 3had ateaser trailerthat infamously teased a movie with a completely different premise (Aliens on Earth?!). Some of it is also just the studios attempting to compete with the speed and ferocity of digital-era hype, to be heard above the constant buzz of phone notifications over virtually nothing (as well as the semi-regular global calamity). After all, the days of getting by on trailers, posters and TV ads alone are long gone, right?Yellowstone, Top Gun, Chalamet: what will the Paramount-Skydance merger mean for film and TV?Read moreMaybe not. Thebiggest global openingof the past weekend was the horror movieWeapons, which exceeded expectations for its launch based largely off of ... trailers that explained the premise of the movie. Obviously there’s more to a marketing campaign than that. In the spring, the film launched awebsitemocked up to look like news postings about Maybrook, the fictional town in the movie, with shades of The Blair Witch Project from 1999. But the baseline of the movie’s marketing was a couple of trailers that showed a lot of creepy imagery but said little about the multi-character plot beyond what the movie reveals in its first two minutes: one night, a group of third-graders from the same class mysteriously rise from their beds, run outside, and disappear into the night. The movie is about figuring out what happened to them; no casting announcements, announcement videos, or greetings from the set needed. For well over a year, about the only thing anyone repeated about this movie in the Hollywood trade publications was that it was a “horror epic” with some elements in common with another 1999 classic, Paul Thomas Anderson’s Magnolia.Of course, Weapons operated with the luxury of less attention from both its studio and the outside press. It’s not the kind of superhero movie or high-profile sequel that gets clicks a year before it comes out. But this strategy isn’t only employed for smaller films. Disney’sLilo & Stitch remake, the second-biggest global hit of the year so far, certainly had plenty of promotion, tie-ins, brand activations and so on. But it successfully waited until much closer to its release date, putting out a couple of traditional low-footage teasers at the end of 2024, and a full trailer a few months before the movie’s release in 2025.Sinners, an ambitious movie with an audience more in line with Weapons, also managed to avoid selling much-hyped nothingburgers, and was able to take audiences by surprise.Next year’s crop of much-hyped sequels will still probably draw crowds. Streep, Hathaway, Nolan, Spider-Man and whoever is in the Avengers these days all have plenty of fans. But the rush to blow up what would normally be lines in a press release to an epic and ceremonious scale still feels sweaty – maybe sweatier, even, as if companies including Disney are desperate to project the image of day-stopping news when another name of an old X-Men cast member turns up on a chair. As recently as the release ofDeadpool & Wolverine, the company prized spoiler protection, with almost none of the movie’s various in-joke cameos signaled ahead of time. That seemed like good marketing, but maybe it was just fear of the fact that many of those cameos were intentionally expectations-undermining jokes, rather than mega-applause moments. It’s harder to tell in retrospect because the hype machine has spent so much time accidentally eliminating the difference between teasers, spoilers and piles of random crumbs.Explore more on these topicsFilmSpider-ManChristopher NolanTom HollandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The stars of a variety night do not normally count gherkins, onions and carrots among their number, not even lower down the bill. We might also share an interest in what creator and performer Ruxandra Cantir has to say about the obsession with pickling in her native Moldova.But what next? That Cantir chooses to remain tight-lipped about the culinary habits of her home country is no big deal, nor even the little this show says about the theme of life, death and preservation. That she has so few ideas about what to do with her pickled vegetables having introduced them, surely is.They look striking. Designed by Fergus Dunnet in Shona Reppe’s production, part of the Made in Scotland showcase, they are bold and imaginatively conceived. To play an onion, she yanks a white knitted jumper over her head and reveals a tuft of stringy hair. Her potato is a dirty amorphous lump, its chits growing over the course of the show. The gherkin is huge, tall, erect, very green – and likes dancing.The tomatoes are just tomatoes and with each punchline of a corny joke they get pulped into ketchup.View image in fullscreenImaginatively conceived … Ruxandra Cantir and Yvonne Strain in Pickled Republic.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianSo far so striking, but with the exception of some lipsyncing to a witty song by John Kielty and an apocalyptic speech by a baby carrot, she has nowhere to take her creations. She uses clown and mime techniques to illustrate being trapped in a pickle jar, timidly suffering unrequited love or anxiously waiting to be picked for consumption, but too few ideas to justify the length of each scene.Rather, the show is reliant on the enthusiasm of an admittedly willing audience to slip into cabaret mode and cheer on each new vegetable as though it were a work of genius. Without their whoops and hollers, it would seem a very thin piece of work.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)CabaretSummerhallreviewsShareReuse this content"

In actor-writer Issy Knowles’ monologue, the setup is similar: on a stage dominated by a bed and littered with condoms, Pollie arrives in a blue silk dressing gown to meet a thousand subscribers as she grants them each a freebie.Pollie is given her own queasy lines of enticement to her fans. But how do you satirise a phenomenon – sex as competitive sport – that is already so extreme in nature? Knowles humorously deadpans Pollie’s insistence that she finds her enterprise erotic, saying how sexy it is to oversee hundreds of legal waivers for the men. Pollie’s discovery that her first visitor is above the age of consent is played as comic frustration, though the question of the character’s predatory behaviour is not deeply pursued. Wearing fake plastic buttocks and breasts, Knowles trains a steely gaze and fixed smile on the audience, who are given the choice to wear balaclavas, like the men queueing for their turn, yet the scattering of masked theatregoers adds little to the atmosphere.Edinburgh fringe 2025: the best theatre and comedy we’ve already reviewedRead moreKnowles considers Pollie’s religious upbringing and first boyfriends but also how society creates and reacts to such sexual extremities. This is done through a voiceover of interview-style questions, many of which are more probing than in Channel 4’s documentary. Pollie compares her “liberating” work with her past career as a consultant, the office tasks choreographed as sex acts. The movement direction is frequently bold to match the bluntness of the script.The flashbacks can be indistinctive but Knowles also delves into the minds of the men in the queue, generally less held to account than OnlyFans stars, and their parasocial relationships with Pollie. She plays an incel spouting conspiracy theories whose violent fantasies are followed by erectile dysfunction. The writing balances dark humour with serious assessment of the men’s discontent, anger and desire for control, recognising the role, too, of ragebait in Pollie’s success (“hate is money … money is power”). She is always compelling in the troubling encounters with expectant subscribers who believe they are not just “only” fans.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalSexPornographyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Jobs wins it and from hereon the rivalry is on – or that is how this production spins it.Capturing the vaguest approximation of the relationship between the men, there is little fidelity to fact, or nuance, or penetrating psychological unpicking. But it is a highly entertaining, well put together parody all the same, however cartoonish in its portrayal of the two central players. It takes swipes at technology (from old-school cameras to printers and the limited life ofAppleproducts) and the nerdy megalomania of tech culture itself.Under the direction of Nick Winston, characters resemble the geeks from TV series The IT Crowd. To a lesser degree, it is about self-acceptance from those deemed oddballs by their school bullies, mainly through the character of Gates. Jobs is, by contrast, a visionary hippy and self-serving ladies’ man whose charisma Gates envies. Both are ridiculed and brilliantly performed.View image in fullscreenA visionary hippy … Kane Oliver Parry in Nerds.Photograph: Pamela RaithWriter-lyricists Jordan Allen-Dutton and Erik Weiner give the show a high school style makeover while Hal Goldberg’s score brings easy, fun tunes. There are romances for the men in Sally (Elise Zavou), a Xerox researcher with a social conscience, and fellow nerd Myrtle (Teleri Hughes) for Gates. Their real-life love lives, and wives, are nowhere to be found.Real life is ignored or smoothed over on the whole: there is a legal battle, which follows some facts around Apple’s suing of Microsoft in 1988, and it ends in an out-of-court settlement, but without really telling us how or why. But it includes a thoroughly amusing rap battle between Gates and Jobs – a highlight of the show – which leads to the sudden transformation of Gates from an insecure tyrant into a fairy godfather of sorts. He steps away from Microsoft willingly here and devotes himself to his charitable foundation. Jobs’ death from cancer is ignored, too, although there is a – very funny – song in which he writes an email to God (with lots of ccs) because he thinks he is dying.While it fails in its factual history, this is a compelling parody of the tech age, then and now, with heaps of the fun factor.AtCowbarn at Underbelly, Bristo Square, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)MusicalsBill GatesSteve JobsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In mid-July, Perkins ordered Hall’s attorneys to offer an update in the case, which had last seen a public filing in December 2023.It is unclear when the arbitration process was finalized. And details were not revealed about the arbitration outcome between the duo who made music together for more than a half century, including hits in the 1970s and 80s such as Maneater, Rich Girl, Kiss on My List and I Can’t Go for That (No Can Do).John Oates opens up about Daryl Hall amid bitter legal battle: ‘I have moved on’Read moreIn 2023 filings in the case, Hall accused Oates of blindsiding and betraying him, saying their relationship and his trust in Oates had deteriorated. Oates replied that he was “deeply hurt” that Hall was making “inflammatory, outlandish, and inaccurate statements” about him.The judge had paused the sale of Oates’s stake in Whole Oats Enterprises LLP to Primary Wave IP Investment Management LLC. Whole Oats includes valuable Hall & Oates materials such as trademarks, personal name and likeness rights, record royalty income and website and social media assets, a court declaration says.The dispute went public in November 2023, when Hall filed the lawsuit asking the judge to stop the sale by Oates so private arbitration could begin.Hall gave a scathing account of their relationship in early November 2023 during arbitration, and it was made public later in the month in the lawsuit. It alleges that Oates and his team engaged in the “ultimate partnership betrayal” by pushing to sell his share while telling Hall’s associates that he wanted to maintain his ownership.In his own declaration, Oates expressed disappointment with his longtime partner’s words, saying Hall’s accusations that Oates went behind his back and breached their agreement were not true. Oates declined to go into specifics, saying he was obligated to keep details private, even if Hall did not.Daryl Hall & John Oates: ‘We had a lethal ability to experiment’Read moreLast year, Oatestold the Associated Pressthat he had had “no communication” with Hall and declined to discuss the legal proceedings. He did not see a Hall & Oates reunion in his future.“I personally don’t see it happening. It’s not in my plans at all. You can ask Daryl Hall what he thinks. But for me personally, no,” he says.The Timesasked Hall in Februaryif the ship had sailed on mending the pair’s relationship.“That ship has gone to the bottom of the ocean,” Hall told the news outlet. “I’ve had a lot of surprises in my life, disappointments, betrayals, so I’m kind of used to it.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

After suggested edits to his 1976 movie Taxi Driver, which starred Robert De Niro, he flew into such a fury that he began threatening to take the law into his own hands.“Marty was very upset,” saysSteven Spielberg. “We get a call at the office: ‘Steve, Steve, it’s Marty. Can you come over to the house? They want me to cut all the blood spurting, they want me to cut the guy who loses his hand.’”“He was going crazy,” adds fellow director Brian De Palma. “I mean, the story is he wanted to kill the head of the studio.”Scorsese himself claims that his plans were slightly less extreme, even if he did claim at the time that he had every intention of buying a weapon. “I don’t know. I was angry. I said I was going to threaten them, or maybe just shoot or something. I had no idea,” he says.Instead, the director’s actual plan involved a different sort of crime. “What I wanted to do – and not with a gun – I would go in, find out where the rough cut is and break the windows and take it back,” he explains.“They’re going to destroy the film anyway, so let me destroy it. I’ll destroy it. But before destroying it, I’m going to steal it.“Spielberg said: ‘Marty stop that! Marty, you can’t do it!’ And the more they said no, the more I said I was going to do it.”The scenes come from an Apple TV+ documentary series, Mr Scorsese, which looks at the director’s life and work drawing on access to his private archives. It features interviews with family, friends and colleagues including De Niro, Daniel Day-Lewis, Sharon Stone, Margot Robbie and Mick Jagger.It was not the first time that the director uttered violent threats during the production ofTaxi Driver. He also infamously appeared in the movie as a passenger who planned to murder his wife after discovering her infidelity, performing a calm monologue strewn with racist language and threats of gun-related violence.Ultimately, a compromise to the editing crisis was struck, meaning that Taxi Driver was able to retain controversial blood-soaked scenes. In the words of Spielberg: “It saved the movie because he didn’t have to cut any of the violence. He just had to take the colour red down to a colour brown.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionMartin ScorseseSteven SpielbergRobert De NiroTaxi DrivernewsShareReuse this content"

Her global Eras tour became the first billion-dollar tour in history, selling 2.4m tickets in a single day, and made more than US$2bn over 21 months. Forbes estimated Swift earned $10m-$13m (£8m-£10m) a night.Her last album, 2024’s The Tortured Poets Department, seta streaming record on Spotify– 300m in one day and 1bn in five – and made her the first artist in history to secure the top 14 spots on theBillboardHot 100.‘Feels bigger than herself’: the importance of Taylor Swift’s latest victoryRead moreIn May, Swift bought back the master recordingsto her first six albums, giving her control over her entire catalogue for the first time. The singer signed with her first label, Big Machine, in 2005, at the age of 15, giving them the rights to her master recordings. In 2019, label head Scott Borchetta sold those six albums to music executive Scooter Braun, who sold them to the private equity firm Shamrock Capital for a reported $300m.To regain control over her catalogue after the sale to Braun – and to devalue his investment – Swift embarked on a project to rerecord all six albums, rebranding each one as “(Taylor’s Version)” and adding “From the Vault” tracks from the original songwriting sessions that hadn’t made it on to the original albums.“I almost stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away,” she wrote in a letter to fans in May, after buying her catalogue back from Shamrock Capital. “But that’s all in the past now. All of the music I’ve ever made … now belongs … to me.”Reputation and Swift’s self-titled debut album, from 2006, are the only albums not to be rerecorded, with fans speculating as to their possible release dates for years.Despite the project now being essentially redundant, it is likely both will have a Taylor’s Version released anyway as Swift remains one of the biggest and most lucrative musical acts in the history of music.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

The laws said anyone with three or four Jewish grandparents was a Jew and anyone with one or two Jewish grandparents wasMischlinge, or mixed race.The IWM’s information board states: “Under the provision of the law, a person was defined as Jewish based on how many observant Jewish grandparents they had, even if they were not personally Jewish themselves.”The inclusion of the word “observant” raised concerns for a retired academic from New York who was visiting the Holocaust Galleries in London last year. She wrote to the IWM saying the “wording referring to observant Jewish grandparents with its lack of historical accuracy must be changed”.The former academic, who asked not to be named, said she had been “extraordinarily impressed” with the material displayed at the galleries. “Then I came to the race laws, and I know that ‘observant’ Jewish grandparents just made no sense. It disregards the vast majority of the Jewish population who are not observant,” she told the Guardian.The Nazis were intent on eradicating all Jews, regardless of whether they were observant or not, she said. “This is such a misleading impression of the Nazi outlook that for me it’s reprehensible that it stays in the public domain.”Caro Howell, the IWM’s director general, told the former academic that “full and sincere consideration” had been given to the points she had raised “but we stand by the curatorial choices that we have made and that our expert advisers have reviewed”.In an email seen by the Guardian, Howell said the integrity of the IWM would be undermined if it made changes every time “questions of interpretative nuance” were raised.The retired academic sought the views of two highly regarded Holocaust historians. Christopher Browning, who has written numerous books on the Holocaust and was an expert witness in theDavid Irving libel trialin 2000, said: “The issue was not whether the grandparent was observant but whether his or her birth had been registered with the Jewish community. The grandparent could later even have converted to Christianity but if the grandparent had been registered as Jewish at birth, that for the Nazis was the deciding factor.”Timothy Snyder, who has also written extensively about the Nazis, said: “It did not matter whether the grandparents were observant … No one was saved from persecution, as the wording incorrectly implies, by having grandparents who were not observant.”He added: “As worded, the suggestion is that ‘bad Jews’, ie those with a secular (or even Reform) background, might have been spared from the persecutions that preceded the Holocaust, whereas ‘good Jews’, those with religious (or Orthodox) backgrounds, were the victims. This is nonsense.”Browning and Snyder have not contacted the IWM directly but the former academic forwarded their comments to the museum.In response, Howell told the former academic that she was “unable to engage in any further correspondence” and that pursuit of the issue “risks sowing division among people who really should pull together”.The IWM is understood to believe that other information displayed in the Holocaust Galleries makes it clear that the Nazis persecuted all Jews regardless of their religious practice.A spokesperson for the museum said: “IWM takes comments regarding our interpretation very seriously and we acknowledge the points made and the sensitivities regarding this caption.“It is inevitable that, in a history as complex – and sometimes contested – as the Holocaust, questions of interpretation and nuance will be raised by audiences from time to time. The [information board] was rigorously reviewed and edited by IWM’s curators, a number of leading international scholars and members of Jewish communities before being printed.”Explore more on these topicsImperial War MuseumsHolocaustSecond world warJudaismNazismnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Michael Tyrone Delaney/The GuardianThe late Kenyan novelist and activist believed erasing language was the most lasting weapon of oppression. Here, Aminatta Forna recalls the man and introduces his essay on decolonisationByNgũgĩ wa Thiong’owith introduction byAminatta FornaTue 12 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 12 Aug 2025 05.29 EDTShareIn the 1930s, it was common for British missionaries to change the names of African school pupils to biblical names. The change wasn’t “just for school” – it was intended to be for ever. So Ngũgĩ became James and my father, Mohamed, became Moses. While many students retained their new names throughout their lives, Ngũgĩ and my father changed theirs back, though you can still find early editions of Ngũgĩ’s first book, Weep Not, Child, under the name of “James Ngugi”. With the novel, Ngũgĩ established himself as a writer and later, by reclaiming his Kikuyu identity as an activist, began a process of decolonisation that he would explore in one of his most famous nonfiction works, Decolonising the Mind (1986), which challenged the dominance of European languages in African education and literature. Ngũgĩ worked throughout his life to promote the decolonisation of language, writing and publishing his books in Kikuyu and only later translating them himself into English.Ngũgĩ was a campaigner against the legacy of colonialism, but first and foremost a Marxist. Studying at the University of Leeds in the 1960s, he witnessed first-hand the brutality of the police towards striking white miners and realised that economic exploitation was a class issue and not a purely racial one. He endured exile, imprisonment, physical assault and harassment by the postcolonial Kenyan authorities and yet never stopped writing and publishing, even penning one of his works, Devil on the Cross (originally titled Caitaani mũtharaba-Inĩ), on prison toilet paper. Detained for his involvement with community theatre groups, Ngũgĩ noted that as long as he wrote in English, the authorities ignored him. Only when he began to write politically critical plays in Kikuyu, and ordinary working people could understand them, was he arrested.View image in fullscreenAminatta Forna.Photograph: PRNgũgĩ was one of the grandfathers of African literature, and his courage made him beloved of a generation of writers. At the 2015 Pen World Voices festival, Ngũgĩ opted to stay in the same hotel as the other African writers, while others of his stature chose loftier accommodation. Here, the likes of Lola Shoneyin, Alain Mabanckou, the late Binyavanga Wainaina, Taiye Selasi, Ngũgĩ’s son Mukoma wa Ngũgĩ and me fetched the cups of tea he drank all day long, found a pen he needed or hailed a taxi on his behalf. One evening I helped organise an after-dinner party in a local bar. Ngũgĩ went to bed early, set an alarm, rose and joined us in the bar. He wanted tea, but the bar didn’t serve it. So someone ran out and fetched him one. In May this year, Ngũgĩ was apparently dancing with some of his students at the University of California, Irvine, to mark the end of the semester on the Friday before his death, at the age of 87.Aminatta FornaSince the publication of my book Decolonising the Mind in 1986, I have seen, over the years, increasing global interest in issues of decolonisation and the unequal power relationships between languages. In 2018, the same issues took me to Limerick in Munster, Ireland, for a conference celebrating 125 years since the foundation of the Gaelic League (Conradh na Gaeilge), in 1893.The league was dedicated to the revival of Gaelic, or Irish, which by then, in its own country, had become subordinate to the dominant English. Despite many efforts, including official government support for its revival, Irish is still subordinate to English. More Irish speak and use English than they do Irish. Some of the most iconic Irish writers, such as WB Yeats and James Joyce, wrote in English, and they are studied as part of the canon of English literature. I cannot conceive of an English department anywhere in the world, including Britain itself, which didn’t teach courses in these writers of Irish origin. They have become some of the greatest contributors to English literature.This unequal power relationship between the two languages in favour of the English was not always the case. The early English settlers in Ireland, Munster in particular, gravitated toward Irish because, by all accounts, in the beginnings of English settlement – particularly between the 13th and 16th centuries – the Irish language was the more endowed in classical learning. Naturally, those early settlers were drawn to the more vibrant Irish tongue. Their gravitation made sense: Irish was the majority tongue, spoken by those among whom the English planters had settled.London acted, and beginning with the 1366 Statutes of Kilkenny, it passed edicts aimed at protecting the English language against the subversive encroachment of Irish or Gaelic, reinforcing by law the use of English while literally criminalising Irish. Among other things, the Kilkenny statutes threatened to confiscate any lands of any English or any Irish living among them who would use “Irish among themselves, contrary to the ordnance”. These policies were given a literary and philosophical rationale by none other than the poet Edmund Spenser, author of The Faerie Queene and himself a settler in Munster. In his pamphlet A View of the Present State of Irelande, published in 1596, he argued that language and naming systems were the best means of bringing about the erasure of Irish memory: “It hath ever been the use of the conqueror to despise the language of the conquered, and to force him by all means to learn his.”The marginal status of Irish in its own land did not come about by some kind of natural evolution. The decline of Irish in its own land was brought about through conscious political acts and educational policies.Ireland, it has been observed, was England’s first settler colony. It became a kind of laboratory for other English settler colonies that followed. And what was true for Ireland and other English colonies was equally so for other colonial systems, whether Spanish, French or Portuguese, or the Japanese occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945. It is also true in the case of domestic colonialism, such as the Norwegian suppression of the language of Sami people. The suppression of the languages of the dominated and the elevation of the language of conquest and domination were integral to the education system that accompanied conquest and colonial occupation.Linguistic suppression was not undertaken for the aesthetic joy of doing so. Spenser was clear that the colonisation of the Irish language and naming system would make the Irish forget who they were, weaken their resistance, and therefore make it easier for the English to conquer and subdue them.Languageconquest, unlike the military form, is cheaper and more effective: the conqueror has only to invest in capturing the minds of the elite, who will then spread submission to the rest of the population. The elite become part of the linguistic army of the conqueror.Because of its centrality in the making of modern Britain, India became, even more than Ireland, a social laboratory, whose results were later exported to other colonies in Asia andAfrica. Thomas Babington Macaulay, as a member of the Supreme Council of India from 1834 to 1838, helped reform the colony’s education system as well as draw up its penal code; both activities have a special significance. In his famous 1835 Minutes on Indian Education, Macaulay advocated the replacement of Sanskrit and Persian with English as the language of education in order to form a class of “interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern, a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect”.Macaulay saw this new language education as bringing about a “civilised state in which the values and standards are to be the values and standards of Britain, in which every one, whatever his origins, has an interest and a part”. A century later, Macaulay’s words would be repeated in colonialKenyaby the then British governor, Sir Philip Mitchell. He outlined a policy for English language dominance in African education which he saw as a moral crusade to supplement the armed crusade against the Kenya Land and Freedom Army, a liberation army the British called the Mau Mau.View image in fullscreenNgũgĩ in December 1980.Photograph: Frank Martin/The GuardianIn 1879, Capt Richard Henry Pratt founded the infamous Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where he devised his own variant of the method for Native American children, less than 20 miles across the scenic Susquehanna River from the steps of the state capitol in Harrisburg. In 1892, he summed up the philosophy behind the boarding school: “Kill the Indian in him, and save the man.” His education programme followed the same colonial pattern: uproot a few from their mother tongue, which is spoken by most of their people, mould them anew in the language of conquest, and then unleash them on the governed masses.In his book How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, Walter Rodney quotes Pierre Foncin, a founder of the Alliance Française, an institution specifically created in 1883 for the propagation of the national language in the colonies and abroad, as being very clear about the goal of the mission. It was “necessary to attach the colonies to the metropole by a very solid psychological bond against the day when their progressive emancipation ends in a form of federation, as is probable – that they be and they remain French in language, thought and spirit”.The goal was very clear. Imperial educational policies were meant to create colonies of the mind, among the elite of the colonised. The success of these policies is undeniable. A variation of the Irish situation, where even after independence, the intellectuals express themselves more fluently in the language of imperial conquest than in the languages from their own country, is present in every postcolonial situation. In the case of Africa, you even hear the identity of the continent being described in terms of Europhonity: anglophone, francophone and lusophone, mainly.Even where the elite are nationalistic and assertive of their independence, they find it easier to express their outrage and hopes in the languages of imperial conquest. Ninety per cent of the moneys allocated for language education goes to pamper imperial languages. Ninety per cent of the population still speaks African languages anyway. Some governments even view African languages as enemies of progress. They believe that imperial languages are really the gateway to global modernity.Under normal circumstances, it would sound odd to hear that French literature can only be written in Japanese, or English literature in IsiZulu, so that when you meet a French writer who writes in French, you look at them in surprise: why on earth are you writing in French? Or an English writer writing in English: why are you not writing in Zulu? And yet this absurdity is expected of African writers and writers from those formerly colonised.How did this absurdity come about? It is not that some languages are more “of language” than others. And under any circumstances, to know more languages can only empower the person. But this was not the case in colonial contexts or any context in which there is a dominating and dominated. It was never a case of adding a new language to what one already had. For the colonial conqueror, it was not enough to introduce an additional language to any community. Imperial languages had to be planted on the graveyard of the languages of the dominated. The death of African languages gave life to European languages. In order for the imperial language to be, the language of the colonised had to cease to be. Amnesia for African languages;anamnesisfor European languages.These two conditions are not inherent in the character of the languages involved. They are mental conditions consciously brought about by how the imperial languages were imposed. In Decolonising the Mind, I have talked about the corporal punishment meted out to African children caught speaking an African language at school, children who were then made to carry a placard around the neck proclaiming their stupidity. In some cases, the culprit was made to swallow filth, thus associating African languages with criminality, pain and filth.This was not just in Africa.In his 2015 testimony to the Waitangi Tribunal about his experiences of school in New Zealand, Dover Samuels, a Māori politician, tells a similar story. Caught speaking Māori in the school, he said: “You’d be hauled out in front of the rest of the class and told to bend over. You’d bend over and he’d stand back and give you, what they called it then, six of the best. On many occasions, not only did it leave bruises behind on my thighs but drew blood.”The Sami people in Norway went through a similar experience in the period between 1870 and 1970 – what they call the brutal century – in an attempt to turn them into fluent Norwegian-language speakers. Violence against native languages is the running theme in the spread of English in Ireland, and in Scotland and Wales. In Wales, those who spoke Welsh in the school compound were made to stand in front of the class, with a placard reading WELSH NOT hanging from their neck. Violence was central in creating the psychological bond of language, culture and thought: colonies of the mind. You would think that after liberation and independence, the new nations, at the very least, would dismantle that unequal power relationship. But that is precisely the power of the colonies of the mind: negativity toward self has become internalised as a way of looking at reality.It is a classic case of conditioning you will find in manuals of behavioural psychology. Conditioning is a system of reward and punishment: punishment for undesired behaviour and reward for the desired behaviour. It is often used in various degrees of intensity in bringing up children or taming animals. The undesired behaviour becomes associated with punishment, and hence pain; the desired behaviour with reward, and hence pleasure. The object of conditioning, a child or an animal, comes to automatically avoid the space of pain, the forbidden behaviour, and gravitate toward the space of pleasure, the required behaviour. In the case of learning, one became the recipient of glory for excelling in the language of conquest, but the recipient of a gory mess for uttering even a single word in one’s mother tongue. One’s mother tongue became the space of pain, to be avoided, and the conquering language became the space of pleasure, to be desired.View image in fullscreenNgũgĩ during a book presentation in Washington DC in 2006.Photograph: Washington Post/Getty ImagesThe trauma experienced by the first generation of the conditioned can be passed on as normal behaviour that needs no explanation or justification; the later generations may not even understand why they associate pain with native languages and pleasure with foreign languages and cultures. The elite and educational planners of the formerly colonised societies assume that European (imperial) languages are inherently global and best able to carry intelligence and universality. That assumption may also explain why criminalising African languages continues to this day, now administered and enforced by African educationalists who don’t see the irony of what they are doing: an African punishing another African for speaking an African language, by order of an African government.The trauma initially wrought by the colonial education system is thus passed on, inherited. Abnormality becomes normalised. The colony of the mind prevents meaningful, nationally empowering innovations in education. Control by the coloniser of the colonised is inherent in the inequality of the education system. Education may become a process of mystifying the cognitive process and even knowledge.Here we need to make a distinction between education and knowledge. Knowledge is a question of continuously adding to what we already know in a dialectical play of mutual impact and illumination. The normal cognitive process starts from the known and heads toward the unknown. Every new step makes more of the unknown known and therefore adds to what is already known. The new known enriches the already known, and so on, in a continuous journey of making dialectically related connections. Knowledge of the world begins where one is.Education, on the other hand, is a mode of conditioning people to make them into, and function in, a given society. It may involve transference of knowledge, but it is conditioned knowledge, branded by the world outlook of the educator and the education system. A careful study of the colonial process, as a particular instance of the dominant and the dominated, the master and the servant, can be useful in thinking about balanced and inclusive education. Colonial education was never balanced or inclusive.The colonial process was always a negation of the normal cognitive process. Imperial Europe – its names, its geography, its history, its knowledge – was always seen as the starting point of the educational journey of the colonised. In short, colonisation, in the area of education, was always predicated on the negation of the colonised space as the starting point of knowledge. In the area of language, it meant a negation of native languages as valid sources of knowledge or as means of intellectual and artistic inquiry. The lack of roots in our base creates a state of permanent uncertainty about our relationship to where we are, to our abilities, even to our achievements.Decolonisation must be at the heart of any balanced and inclusive education. Both the formerly colonising and the formerly colonised are affected by a system that has shaped the globe over the last 400 years. Knowledge starts wherever we are. Our languages are valid sources of knowledge. We all love the stars, but we don’t have to migrate to Europe, physically or metaphorically, in order to reach them.View image in fullscreen‘All languages, large and small, have a lot to contribute to our common humanity’ … Ngũgĩ in 2022.Photograph: Michael Tyrone Delaney/The GuardianIn the case of languages, we have to reject the commonly held wisdom that the problem in any one country or the world is the existence of many languages and cultures, and even religions. The problem is their relationship in terms of hierarchy. My language is higher in the hierarchy than yours. My culture is higher than yours. Or my language is global; yours is local. And in order for you to know my language, you must first give up yours. The view that my god is more of a god than your god is very ungodly. This view leads some people to see their own language as inherently more of a language than other languages and therefore to insist that they themselves must be ranked higher in knowledge and power. This is what I call linguistic feudalism.All languages, large and small, have a lot to contribute to our common humanity if freed from linguistic feudalism. Education policies should be devised on the basis that all languages are treasuries of history, beauty and possibility. They have something to give to one another if their relationship is that of the give-and-take of a network. Even if one of the languages emerges as the language of communication across many languages, it should not be so on the basis of its assumed inherent nationality or globality, but on the basis of need and necessity. And even then, it should not grow on the graveyard of other languages.Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o: three days with a giant of African literatureRead moreBalanced and inclusive education calls for a new slogan: network, not hierarchy. We have to understand that all languages, big and small, have a common language: it is called translation.Education should never lead to linguistic and cultural self-isolation. I want to connect to the world, but that doesn’t mean I have to negate my starting base. I want to connect to the world from wherever I am. I believe that the goal of education is knowledge that empowers, that shows our real connections to the world, but from our base. From our base, we explore the world: from the world, we bring back that which enriches our base.That, it seems to me, is the real challenge in organising knowledge and transmitting it in an inclusive and balanced education system in the world today. We have to reject the notion that splendour is not splendour unless it springs from squalor. Palaces are not palaces unless erected on prisons. My millions are not millions unless mined from a million poor. For me to be, others must cease to be. Education must convey knowledge that empowers us to imagine more inclusive palaces, where my being enables your being and yours enables mine.Decolonizing Language and Other Revolutionary Ideasby Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o (Penguin Books, £20).

Or super underwhelming. This family animation about a baby with superhero powers is adapted from a children’s book series by the bestselling Swedish crime novelist Camilla Läckberg, but with almost no feel for its target audience. It’s pitched at very young kids (if you ignore the dodgy gag about a new mum breastfeeding her baby’s father). But Super Charlie is seriously lacking a sense of fun or a silly streak to tickle little funny bones – it’s as if the film-makers have never met anyone under five.Willie (voiced by Alex Kelly in the English-language version) is a 10-year-old in a deep pit of disgruntlement following the birth of his baby brother, Charlie. “How long will he be this useless?!” His exhausted parents are too busy for him so when Willie discovers that Charlie has got super powers, he decides to claim the glory for himself (making an “S” for sidekick T-shirt for little Charlie). There’s an elaborate backstory to explain the villains, another pair of siblings with a plot to take control of the police force using robo-police suits.There is a serious theme here about the hurt and resentment a child can feel at being usurped by the arrival of a new baby. But Super Charlie doesn’t have anywhere near the heart of a Pixar; it simply chugs along, bland and a bit unimaginative. It doesn’t have nearly enough fun with its pint-sized superhero either.The Boss Babygot plenty of mileage out of a baby carrying a briefcase, and little Jack-Jack inThe Incredibleswas cute as well as mighty. Poor Super Charlie is destined to be no one’s favourite child.Super Charlie is in UK and Irish cinemas from 15 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFamily filmsFilm adaptationsSwedenreviewsShareReuse this content"

What I am conscious of now is that people know who I am and that is really relatively recent.”Just as confidence comes with age, so does a responsibility to use her profile to speak out on behalf of those who don’t have such a platform. Most recently Margolyes, who is Jewish, has faced a backlash for her stridentcriticism of the actions of the Israeli government in Gaza.“People say: ‘You’re just an actor, for fuck’s sake, shut up.’ Well, that is a point of view. I don’t happen to share that. I think that if you have a chance to make an impact for good, to change things, then you should. I think it’s an absolute requirement, and people don’t, out of fear sometimes. They are afraid of being cancelled. You can’t cancel me!” she says.Just off a flight from Australia, where she lives part-time with her partner, and suffering from “punishing” jet lag along with a recent back injury, Margolyes admits that life on the road can be tiring. “I’m gathering my powers and I will deliver, but it is a struggle.”Also appearing at Edinburgh this year is Linden, a veteran character actor and one of Margolyes’s Harry Potter co-stars, who played the horcrux thief Mundungus Fletcher. This year marks the 40th anniversary of his Edinburgh debut in 1985. Now 71, when Linden last performed at the festival in 2022, he suffered a big respiratory attack and ended up in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.You don’t retire from the profession, the profession retires youAndy LindenHaving been told by his doctor in no uncertain terms that “next time it happens I’d need a hearse not an ambulance”, Linden is embarking on his first booze- and cigarette-free festival as he returns with Baxter vs the Bookies, a show he wrote and performs himself, charting the fortunes of an ageing horse-racing tipster bamboozled by modern technology.“In the past we gloriously defiled ourselves one way or another, but as the years unfold experience takes a hand,” he says with some forbearance. “Edinburgh is the Grand National, not a five-furlong sprint and whether you’re young or old you’ve got to pace yourself.”Linden’s advice for performers of any age is to take a few days off during the run: “Edinburgh can be very insular so try to do something a little different, go up the coast. I go to the football and watch Hearts or Hibs. Don’t do 30 days nonstop.”The festival has changed mightily in scale since he first performed here, and has become “fiercely competitive”. But ageism is not a concern for Linden: the “brigade of old gits” he is referring to includes Ivor Dembina, Stephen Frost, Mark Arden and Mark Thomas.“You don’t retire from the profession,” he says, “the profession retires you.” And until that happens, he plans to start work in October on a new character project about a boxing cornerman.View image in fullscreen‘You take more creative risks’ ... Vivienne Powell(left)and Christine Thynne.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianOthers are making their debut here. I come to the Assembly Rooms bar to meet two women who are sitting poised on high stools. Vivienne Powell, 76, has just emerged from the first performance of her solo show Diva, about an opera singer with dementia battling to reclaim her memories through music. Christine Thynne, 82, a retired physiotherapist who took her first dance class at 68, is embarking on the first full run of her choreographed performance These Mechanisms.It’s a physically challenging dance piece involving scaffolding planks and stepladders. Does Thynne rub up against expectations of how a woman of her age ought to behave or what she is even capable of? She laughs. “At 82, people say: ‘You shouldn’t be going up a stepladder, somebody else should be changing the lightbulbs!’”Powell adds: “Our society is pretty ageist, in a lot of ways.Older peoplecan be quite dismissed for what they can contribute, particularly women. So, to be doing our own shows at the fringe at a more mature age is pretty amazing.”Thynne concurs: “When you look back over the programmes of past years, I don’t know that there have been many elderly women who have done a full show.”Yet the pair remain largely unfazed by their own trajectories. “It can be quite common with women”, Powell argues, “who don’t come into themselves until their 40s or 50s. And they discover talents, interests that they didn’t know they had. They start a whole new chapter of their lives.” Having worked as a teacher while raising her three children in Sydney, Australia, latterly as a single parent, Powell gave her first professional opera recital in her early 40s and later acted on stage, in TV and film in Los Angeles.Do Powell and Thynne believe they are braver as performers because of their age and experience? “Definitely,” insists Powell. “You take more creative risks.”“My piece is completely about creative risks,” agrees Thynne. “From the beginning where I’m lying on a scaffolding plank and turning over its width. That’s the essence of the creativity, because the audience wonder what is going to happen next, then they realise: this isn’t an elderly person, this is an exciting piece of work.”There should be no age limit to creativity, says Powell. Her advice to those still contemplating their next chapter is straightforward: “Follow your heart, do what you love.” She raises one finger for emphasis: “And don’t settle.”Thynne says: “Even if you’re bringing up children and juggling all these different things and the ups and downs of life, still follow your dream. And be very, very positive about that!”Both women’s grandchildren will see their shows. Powell reads hers a George Eliot quote: “It’s never too late to be what you might have been.”Margolyes and Dickens: More Best Bitsis at Pentland theatre at Pleasance at EICC until 24 August.Baxter vs the Bookiesis at Gilded Balloon Patter House until 25 August.Divais at Assembly Rooms, Drawing Room, until 24 August.These Mechanismsis atDance Base until 20 AugustDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He leads you in, puts you at ease, and offers to tuck you into a bed in the room (there is an option to keep sitting if you prefer).The show is a combination of recorded monologue, music and physical theatre. Words and music pour into your head through headphones. Ayres speaks of an unnamed illness that leaves him in acute pain. He is later diagnosed with the rare and severe chronic immune condition called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, although it is not named in the recording. It leaves Ayres disabled and his story speaks of his nearness to death at the age of 20. In the course of his emergency admission, a doctor puts his atypical symptoms down to the testosterone that Ayres is taking (he is trans). It is a dissonant moment, not dwelt on, but it buzzes with alarm. Ayres adds to the story through occasional, oblique, movement.An award-winning show from Melbourne, it is experimental in nature, not explaining itself or imposing meanings. Still, you realise you are sitting in a hospital bed – possibly his? For me, it is about his pain, loneliness, the horror of an unnamed illness – and the horror of being judged, maybe condemned, by a doctor.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Dijana RisteskaThere is a narrow partition screen with images projected on it but it serves as a mirror, too; Ayres sits on a chair on one side while you are on the other. It brings you closer to his experience. There is direct eye contact. Symbolically, you cannot look away from the story.Then it is over, possibly too soon, with questions left dangling. One detail that returns is the doctor’s assumption that Ayres’ illness was caused by the taking of testosterone. I ask about this and the answers he gives turns it into a show about transphobia and its effects, alongside its more existential themes.It is a reckoning, of sorts, although there is an emotional intangibility there. I walk out feeling an affinity with Ayres but also with a need to know more. I would have liked to have carried on talking.At theTraverse, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalTraverse theatreTransgenderHealthreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a message’: the misunderstood misfits of Nigeria’s underground rock sceneIn a country that doesn’t always reward difference, defiant Nigerian musicians are reawakening their country’s rock and giving those on the margins the space to feel seenTiléwa KazeemTue 12 Aug 2025 07.47 EDTShareIn the violet hush of a late-night doom scroll, I stumbled across her: a woman clad in lacquered leather and glinting chains, legs laced in harnesses. She stood mid-growl, clutching the mic as if to throttle it, her silhouette framed by a red LED screen that read “Rock Nights” along with the name of the artist: Clayrocksu.Beneath the stage at Pop Landmark in Lagos,Nigeria, a sparse crowd of silver-studded misfits was filmed thrashing around in a trance. The performance provoked a small moral panic in the comments: cries of “demonic” and fears that Clayrocksu was “slipping into darkness”.The darkness Clayrocksu and others move through isn’t occult, though – it’s obscurity. In the west, goth and emo subcultures offer outsiders a name, a tribe, but in Nigeria they barely exist. The industry here forgets itself every few decades, and since the rise of Afrobeat, and later Afrobeats, rock has been sealed off or paved over. But it’s kept alive by DIY shows such as Clayrocksu’s Rock Nights series, WhatsApp chats, shared gear, and today’s small scene – bands such as LoveSick, ASingerMustDie and the Recurrence – is raw and defiant.Long before Clayrocksu et al ever screamed into a mic, Nigerians were shaping rock to their own rhythm. Between 1967 and 1970, Nigeria fought a brutal civil war after the south-eastern region declared itself the Republic of Biafra. In the aftermath, the Hygrades, who lit up the 1970s with tracks like In the Jungle, came from the east along with the Funkees and the Doves – post–Biafran war kids with guitars, trying to turn trauma into sound. These early bands still leaned on the swagger of Hendrix and the snarl of Jagger, but it wasn’t until Fela Kuti – fierce, lyrical, unmistakably ours – that Afro-rock began to speak in a Nigerian voice.But more immediately palatable pop, dance and gospel came to fill the airwaves, while rock had no radio, no label push, no hype. Still, it lived on in the margins, and more recently fan-led WhatsApp groups such as Rockaz World and Rock Republic have kept the flame going, along with the now-defunct Naija School of Rock blog. Clayrocksu isn’t just a musician and now a member of the Recording Academy in the US, whose members vote for the Grammys; she’s also an ambassador for the scene who set up the collective Afrorockstars in 2024. It’s a kind of Justice League for Lagos’s indie rock scene, where artists band together, host shows, and keep the flame alive.With her monthly Rock Nights series on hold due to a lack of funding, Clayrocksu has teamed up with Lagos venue Kevwe and Cam for a band showcase called Lagos Misfits Takeover. I head there to find what is left of Nigerian rock.“I don’t remember a time when I wasn’t into rock,” Clayrocksu says before going on stage. As a kid, she played bootleg pop-rock CDs on her Walkman. Her dad was a rock head, too – less edgy metal, more Bon Jovi and Michael Bolton – but when Clayrocksu started covering his favourites, she finally got it. “I can’t explain it,” she says of her love of rock. “The music called to me, and I want others to feel that, too.”She’s unfazed by the moral panic she unleashed. “I don’t pay it any mind, honestly,” she says. For the Afrorockstars community, “rock is just part of life, same as their faith”. She pauses, fingers grazing the crucifix around her neck. “Some of them wear crosses, too.”She introduces me to LoveSick’s frontman Korny, a 31-year-old, soft-spoken man with a bald head and a Jason Voorhees–style hockey mask clipped to his pants, his lucky charm. “I bought it the night we won Battle of the Bands,” he says, referring to a Lagos event late last year, which was LoveSick’s first ever live performance. “I used my last cash to buy it from a vendor who said everything she sells is blessed. I wore it, we played and we won triple what I paid.”He looks every bit the nerdy IT solutions guy, but that changes when he takes the mic and growls through Guiding, a track whose lyrics – “I’ve got 5k [Naira, about £2.50] left in my bank account” – are about surviving Nigeria as a broke youth.The sound at the venue is rough, but “we can’t wait for perfect sound like Afrobeats,” Korny shrugs. “The show must go on.” His voice – guttural, sharp, sometimes screeching – feels scorched. “I taught myself back in 2011,” he says. “Just mimicking my favourites.” They were Korn’s Jonathan Davis, Linkin Park’s Chester Bennington, Asking Alexandria’s Danny Worsnop. Now, he cycles through screams, growls and pig squeals. “It’s not noise,” he says. “It’s a voice. A message.”View image in fullscreenBrother duo ASingerMustDieAlso playing at Kevwe and Cam is brother duo ASingerMustDie. “Hope y’all are ready to die tonight,” one of them deadpans into the mic. The venue’s walls are lined with portraits of legends like Oliver De Coque and Fela Kuti, watching over the night’s rising acts, and ASingerMustDie’s set feels distinctly Nigerian – rock as the vessel, but with a message rooted in lived experience. “It’s all about feelings, experiences, societal issues,” the brothers tell me. Their song Córazon, for instance, was born from a toxic love story and the fear that leaving would hurt more than staying.Phones light up during LoveSick’s set, and again for Clayrocksu, as fans look to prove they were here. Xavier, a fan of LoveSick, says he’s been into rock for about 13 years: he first heard it on Need for Speed and Fifa, and it hit him like nothing else. “Power chords and riffs break from traditional music patterns – they’re chaotic, but beautiful,” he says. “In a place as chaotic as Nigeria, rock helped me make sense of it all.”For this crowd, it isn’t just music, it’s making space to feel seen in a country that doesn’t reward difference. “Even if you don’t sing rock,” Clayrocksu tells me, “you can still be one of the cool kids with us.”ASingerMustDie’s new EP Songs to Die For is released 25 AugustExplore more on these topicsMetalPop and rockNigeriafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He enjoyed successful runs at the major British houses – Covent Garden, English National Opera and Glyndebourne – as well as the Metropolitan, New York, but he was also dogged by misfortune.Progressing from lighter roles in Mozart and bel canto opera to weightier parts such as Don Alvaro in La Forza del Destino and Cavaradossi in Tosca, he finally attained the zenith of many a tenor’s aspirations, the title role in Otello, bringing to the part his characteristic combination of commanding tone, lyrical timbre and skilful phrasing. Of his performance at ENO in 1998, the critic ofOperamagazine prophesied: “Given the right opportunities, Rendall’s Otello will surely bestride the world.”He did indeed go on to sing Otello at La Scala and Dresden, as well asGlyndebournein 2001 and again four years later, but it was also in 2005 that there occurred a disastrous stage malfunction in a performance of Aida at the Royal Danish Opera in Copenhagen. Sealed in the underground tomb in the final act, he became aware of the stage above going sideways instead of up, resulting in the destruction of the set. “I was knocked down at least 15 feet”, he recalled, “and tried to crawl to safety to avoid being crushed.”View image in fullscreenRendall, in the brown suit, as Cavaradossi in Tosca at English National Opera, 1990.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyThe serious injuries he suffered required a hip replacement, with subsequent knee-joint replacement, and extensive shoulder surgery. His £250,000 claim for compensation against the theatre’s owners, the Danish Ministry of Culture, cited loss of earnings, on the basis that opera companies doubted his ability to achieve the same high standards as previously. He subsequently also sued the surgeon who performed the operation for using a controversial technique of “mixing and matching” hip replacement parts, seriously affecting his mobility.The Copenhagen incident was not the first time Rendall had been in the headlines for the wrong reasons. At a performance ofPagliacciin Milwaukee in 1998, the blade of the prop knife his character Canio was using to stab his unfaithful wife Nedda and her lover Silvio failed to retract. The baritone playing Silvio, Kimm Julian, narrowly escaped a possibly mortal injury. A farcical element was added when the police who had been called to the scene confused the plot of the opera recounted to them with the real-life scenario, and came to believe that Rendall himself was seeking revenge for a marital infidelity. He was finally released without charge.Rendall was born in London, the son of Phyllis (nee Tuffin), a nurse, and John Rendall, a stockbroker’s manager. As a teenager he was the vocalist of a covers band called All on Edge, but was working in the BBC’s gramophone library (as it was then called) when he was overheard byRoy Plomleyand Ronald Cook, the presenter and producer of Desert Island Discs, singingQuesta o quella(a castaway’s choice) from Rigoletto. Disapproving of the choice of singer, he had played the disc 10 to 12 times, by his own account, “learned the tune and a couple of the words”, went into the studio and put it down on tape.So impressed were Plomley and Cook, listening in an adjacent room, that they made contact on his behalf with two London conservatoires. He was offered a bursary at the Royal Academy of Music.View image in fullscreenRendall as Tristan, with Susan Bullock as Isolde, at the Coliseum, London, in 2003.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianHis debut as a soloist was with Glyndebourne Touring Opera in 1975 as Ferrando in Così fan tutte. He graduated to the festival proper in the same role the following year, but was not to return until 1988 as Belmonte in Die Entführung aus dem Serail, followed by Tom Rakewell in The Rake’s Progress. Meanwhile at Covent Garden between 1975 and 1990, he sang such roles as Count Almaviva, Massenet’s Des Grieux, Matteo in Arabella and Rodrigo in La Donna del Lago, while at ENO between 1976 and 1992 he won acclaim as Leicester in Maria Stuarda, the Duke in Rigoletto, Rodolfo and Pinkerton. To all these roles he brought exemplary diction, an impressive legato line and a thrilling, though seemingly effortless, delivery.He also flourished at the Met, making his debut there as Ernesto in Don Pasquale (1980) and returning for 10 seasons to sing six of the principal Mozart tenor roles as well as Matteo, Lensky and David in Die Meistersinger. Deciding, with his second wife, the mezzo-soprano Diana Montague, that they would focus their careers on the UK and Europe, in order to enjoy family life with their children, Rendall thereafter declined many offers from America and elsewhere.In his enforced retirement he kept an entertaining blog retailing anecdotes from his life and career, including a temporary loss of sight after being struck on the temple by a singer playing Don Alfonso and an incident involving the New York police department when a dish of curry was emptied over the head of a restaurateur. The picture emerges of a colourful, combative character who, despite setbacks, lived life to the full.He is survived by Diana, and their three children, Eleanor, Amelia and Huw, and by two children, Edward and Elizabeth, from his first marriage, to Kathryn George, which ended in divorce.David Rendall, tenor, born 11 October 1948; died 21 July 2025Explore more on these topicsOperaGlyndebourneobituariesShareReuse this content"

The village of Chandley is “small” and “complicated”, he says warmly. “Everyone’s got their own story.” The action cuts between cosy, wooden cottages and a moss-covered forest filled with folkloric creatures. We see the protagonist, a horticulturist wizard “steeped in the green and growing arts”, returning home and tending to an abundance of vegetables. Some you’ll find in your local supermarket; others are of a decidedly more magical variety.As a rural life simulation, Mandrake is odder and more beguiling than most. It possesses the same undeniable allure as classics such as Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley, inviting players to slip into the seasonal flow of crop cultivation, countryside exploration and conversations with suspiciously cheerful townsfolk. But there’s more going on here: lush, painterly visuals to start. And should you tire of tilling the soil, you might wander off the beaten path of this mythical, Brythonic-inspired land, perhaps eavesdropping on the dead or even befriending a river.View image in fullscreenCosy cultivation … Mandrake.Photograph: Failbetter GamesWeirdness is to be expected in a new release from Failbetter, the boutique UK studio behind acclaimed titles Fallen London and Sunless Sea. Set in a shared fictional universe, that narrative RPG and moody survival experience, respectively, were masterclasses in evocative prose and captivating world-building. London became “Fallen”, submerged in a darkened underworld called the Neath, newly situated on the coast of a vast, black ocean – the so-called Unterzee.These games, horrifying and hilarious in nearly equal measure, were rooted in a deft sense of place. Mandrake foregrounds location in a friendlier, more accessible way. The beauty of the rural life sim, as game director Adam Myers sees it, is that “you’re able to zoom in on one community over time”. Across days, nights and seasons, the player bears witness to a changing place and its people. You go from a sense of total unfamiliarity, says Myers, to having developed a deep knowledge of the environment.But Mandrake aims to eschew the genre’s grindier tendencies – cultivating acres of wheat and making multiple daily meals. “It isn’t optimal to grow your crops in large rectangular monocultures,” says Myers. “And you’re not doing the thing where you click 30 times and carry a banquet’s worth of ratatouille around in your inventory at all times.”View image in fullscreenComplicating rural the rural sim … Mandrake.Photograph: Failbetter GamesGift-giving, the typical way players ingratiate themselves with their NPC neighbours in this genre, arrives with a wrinkle. Players cannot just hand out presents randomly (“That’s a little awkward,” laughs Myers). Instead, they must declare why they are handing out their offerings. This forms the start of a relationship based on obligation.The aim is to not just replicate the pattern seen in other rural life sims, but “complicate” it, both through thoughtful mechanics and an unusual set of influences. Myers talks enthusiastically of anthropology, British folklore and esoteric traditions such as Renaissance alchemy. The world is filled with quirky and mysterious lore: it is inhabited by “quasi-monastic organisations” and despite the Welsh influences in the landscape, there is an eerie absence of sheep.The comforting rituals of the rural life sim seem to function as a Trojan horse for Failbetter’s peculiar and offbeat tendencies. “One of the error patterns we’ve fallen into in the past is going too weird, too fast, too soon,” admits Myers. “We need to give players more stable ground to stand on so they can make sense of everything – put the pieces together to properly appreciate what’s unusual and strange.”Ominous creatures undoubtedly lurk in these ancient woods; villagers are likely to conceal many portentous secrets. It’s reasonable to assume that Myers’s and his colleagues’ taste for the macabre surfaces in some manner. But there’s a crucial difference, a concession, perhaps, to maintaining what he hopes is a welcoming and “emotionally gentle” tone: unlike some of Failbetter’s other games, death doesn’t lurk quite so close to your shoulder. Or as Myers puts it, “you probably won’t be able to get yourself eaten in this one”.Mandrake is in development for PC with console support planned.

The years 1850 to 1914 remained his focus and he had a lifelong involvement with the Victorian Society. He completed the book after joining the Greater London council (GLC) in 1974 to work on the long-running Survey of London project. Originated in 1894, the survey researches London buildings by district, and has so far published 55 volumes.The experience of working on the survey was formative for Saint, who recalled howFrancis Sheppard, then its general editor, had recently begun to “treat areas of London in a holistic way, drawing urban development, architecture and social and economic history together”. In the final decade before the GLC was abolished in 1986, Andrew and others from the survey made lasting alliances with members of the council’s historic buildings division, then flexing its muscles to win conservation battles by the quality of its research and advocacy, notably over Covent Garden, which was under threat of redevelopment.Saint’s research then took a different turn. Admirers of Stirrat Johnson-Marshall, an architect dedicated to public service who died in 1981, were keen to celebrate his memory and that of a like-minded generation. Saint accepted the task of writing up the story, for which the GLC gave him six months’ leave. Knowing individuals such asDavidandMary Medd, famous for their role in the Hertfordshire schools building programme, gave Saint an exemplar of interdisciplinary collaboration through the chain from patronage and innovative construction to the grace notes of murals and sculpture. He organised public reminiscence sessions at the Architectural Association in 1984 that reunited many involved in Hertfordshire schools, as well as projects such as the Festival Hall, the Alton estate in Roehampton and the rebuilding of Coventry.Published in 1986 as Towards a SocialArchitecture, the resulting book showed how technical and humanist aims were integrated in such projects. A year later came the first listing of a post-1945 building and the instigation of the “30-year rule” that allowed buildings in England to qualify for listing on reaching that age.View image in fullscreenThe former Warring and Gillow building on Oxford Street in London was included by Andrew Saint in the Survey of London.Photograph: Chris Redgrave/Historic England ArchiveOnce the GLC was dissolved, its historic buildings division remained under English Heritage. Saint moved across, joining old friends such as Robert Thorne, and new recruits, includingElain Harwood, Roger Bowdler and Steven Brindle, and setting the pace for the team researching threatened buildings. Monday morning team meetings always ended in the pub.At the start of the 1990s, the minister for the environment,Baroness Blatch, encouraged a more active approach to listing postwar buildings and an innovative study programme was established with an expert committee. Martin Cherry of English Heritage, who directed the research, said that Saint’s “commitment to it was important in providing confidence to senior policymakers that it was worthwhile and had substance: his academic reputation helped, but also his ability to demonstrate that postwar building, particularly housing and schools, was a force for good”. Taking a quote from Auden, A Change of Heart, as a title, Saint wrote the text for a pamphlet that launched the project in public in 1992.In 1995, he was headhunted for a newly created chair at the University of Cambridge School of Architecture, where he experienced a less congenial working culture. His belief that architects were not as important as they thought themselves was strengthened, and he began work on his longest book, Architect and Engineer – a study in “sibling rivalry”, published in 2007, that sought to understand their different characteristics.View image in fullscreenAll Saints church in central London is documented in the Survey of London volume written by Andrew Saint.Photograph: Chris Redgrave/Historic England ArchiveAt Cambridge, he struggled to persuade colleagues to publish for the new Research Assessment Exercise, but became a notable supervisor of doctorates, with students including James Campbell and Timothy Brittain-Catlin, who have altered the Cambridge course to become more grounded and practical in ways he desired.Saint was happy to take voluntary severance from Cambridge in 2006. He returned to the Survey of London as general editor, invigorating the research and publishing programme by completing work already in hand on Clerkenwell and, with colleagues, adding volumes on Woolwich, Battersea and South Marylebone. He personally undertook most of the volume on Oxford Street before stepping down to half time and then, in 2015, to retirement, by which time the survey was being administered by the Bartlett School of Architecture at UCL.Saint continued to be active as an author and editor, with a book on late Victorian London published in 2021, and editorship of the Victorian Society’s journals and its series of monographs. A book on Waterloo Bridge and its Surrey side hinterland awaits posthumous publication.Born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, Andrew was the younger son of Elisabeth (nee Butterfield) and the Rev Arthur Maxwell Saint (known as Max). The family moved to Cheltenham, where Andrew went to Dean Close junior school, and then to Christ’s Hospital school, Horsham. Andrew relished Latin and Greek, singing and playing the cello, while hating sports, and made strong friendships. His interest in architecture came from “church crawling” with his parents, from the Aston Webb buildings of his school, and later from Oxford, where he studied classics. When his father became chaplain of Guy’s hospital, he lived in London for the first time and loved the abandoned feeling of the Southwark riverside.Taking Oxford entrance a year early, he got an exhibition to Balliol College, and spent time in Italy at the British School at Rome. A master’s degree at the Warburg Institute in London on Ruskin led to his first part-time teaching job in the art department at Essex University.From the early 1970s until the late 80s, Saint was the partner of Ellen Leopold, an American architect and academic, and they had two daughters, Lily and Catherine. After the relationship ended, Ellen, Lily and Catherine settled in the US, while Saint remained in London, living in a Duchy of Cornwall terrace house in Kennington. He had another daughter, Leonora, from a relationship with Annachiara Cerri. In later life, his partner was the Dutch art historian Ida Jager. He is survived by Ida and his daughters.Andrew John Saint, architectural historian, born 30 November 1946; died 16 July 2025Explore more on these topicsArchitectureArt and design booksSociety booksobituariesShareReuse this content"

That’s where she made the wine,”says Pepa Fernández proudly, pointing towards a weathered building no bigger than a garden shed. We’re standing between two fields on a chalky road skirted by poppies, daisies and thistles. One field is lined with neat rows of lush vines, the other with small bush vines soon to bear monastrell grapes (the most dominant variety in these parts). In the distance, a sandy-coloured mountain range peppered with pine trees sits beneath a cloudless blue sky.Pocket-sized Pepa is the face ofBodega Balcona, a family-run organic winery in Spain’s south-eastern province of Murcia. The vineyard lies in the picturesque Aceniche valley, in Bullas – one of Murcia’s three wine DOPs (denominaciónes deorigen protegida), alongside Yecla and Jumilla. Each has its own wine route, scattered with museums and vineyards.My girlfriend and I are in the area to explore Murcia’s food and drink scene after a tipoff from an old friend who grew up in the city (Murcia is the name of both the province and its capital). The province hosted two of Spain’s most prestigious culinary events last year: theRepsol Guide Soles galaand the Michelin Guide gala.View image in fullscreenSalto del Usero in Bullas is a lovely spot for a cooling dip.Photograph: Antonio Lopez/Alamy“Murcia is one of the best food cities in Spain,”a suave Granada-based gentleman in a fedora tells me on the way to the tasting room. We soon learn that its wine is pretty special, too, as we make our way through Bodega Balcona’s roster of earthy natural wines. Each glass is paired with national and regional dishes: cold cuts, local cheeses, almonds, tuna empanadas, and a Murcian favourite made by Pepa’s nephew,pastel de carne– a hearty meat and egg pie topped with flaky pastry.After, we drive to the nearby Salto del Usero waterfall, where kids are paddling and teenagers are sunning themselves on rocks, like lizards. Following a quick dip in the chilly plunge pool, we go to meet Paco Franciso Muñoz Reales, who runs an organic farm nearby with his German wife, Heidi.Murcia's agricultural heritage stems from a vast network of fertile gardens that surround the city, where baroque buildings and buzzing tapas bars clusterLaid-back and softly spoken, Paco is part of a localcooperative of growers, including Pepa, using ecological farming methods. He explains there was a little bit of tension with local farmers when he first started, but things have settled down. On a tour of his five-hectare estate, he shows me a seed bank tucked inside a pantry, rows of apricot, olive and lemon trees, and a tomato patch.View image in fullscreenOutside Murcia Cathedral with apastel de carne, a meat and egg pie that’s a specialty of the region.Photograph: Panther Media Global/AlamyNicknamed the garden of Europe, Murcia accounts for around20% of Spain’s fruit and vegetable exports. This agricultural heritage stems from a vast network of fertile gardens, orhuertos, that surround the city of Murcia, where baroque buildings, palm-lined riverbanks and buzzing tapas bars cluster around Plaza de las Flores. La Huerta de Murcia, as the fertile area is called, also influences local food culture, with Sundays traditionally reserved for family meals at rustic restaurants.Each spring, the city also throws theBando de la Huertafestival – a lively celebration of rural life where locals don traditional dress and feast on regional dishes. We arrive a few weeks later, so instead visit the rustic El Cañal Los Almillas restaurant, where we tuck intoheaped platters of beef entrecote dusted with a layer of rock salt, and a fresh tomato salad with olives and lettuce, accompanied by plates of lemon (Murcianos squeeze lemon on everything). We finish with a classic Murcian dessert of crispy, deep-friedpaparajotes– battered lemon leaves served with a dollop of ice-cream.Samuel Ruiz, the young, tattooed chef, could be Spain’s Anthony Bourdain. He trained at the famed El BulliThe restaurant is named after the city’s canal system, which are part of an irrigation system dating back to Moorish times.“Think of it as the Segura River being the heart and the canals the veins that deliver the blood,”our guide, Antonio, explains.David López, the chef at the fine-dining restaurantLocal de Ensayo, tells us these ancient systems are still in use today as he shows us around hishuerto. López visits his patch daily, growing everything from lettuce, beans and cucumber to strawberries and aubergines. Fruit and vegetables feature prominently in traditional Murcian cooking, in dishes such asensalada murciana(tomato salad with tuna, olives and egg) andarroz con verduras(rice with vegetables).“It’s a way of life for me, somewhere I can bring the children to plant things and watch them grow,”López says while trudging through the mud, checking his crops. About 20% of the produce used in his restaurant comes from his garden, the rest being supplied by an ecological farmer with a stall atVerónicas market, which sells fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and olive oil to the city.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We finish atCafé Bar Verónicas, which to the untrained eye looks like any other neighbourhood bar: metal countertops, shelves of pickled vegetables and wine, and locals chatting loudly. However, framed newspaper reviews hint at something more.It’s run by Samuel Ruiz and his wife, Isabel Torrecillas. The young, tattooed chef could be Spain’s Anthony Bourdain. Ruiz, who trained at the famed El Bulli, was responsible for one of Murcia’s most exciting restaurants, Kome, a tiny Japanese-style tavern.“They didn’t have social media. No website. Nothing. But people still queued down the street,”Torrecillas tells us. Ruiz decided to shut down Kome and return to his roots, opening abarrawith a twist in the heart of town, she explains as a plate ofcaballito(little horse in Spanish) lands on the table. The popular local dish usually features deep-fried prawns, only here it’s made with fist-sized crayfish, shell and all. It’s followed by a good-sized bowl ofmarinera, a kind of Russian salad with anchovies, served with crisp bread and homemade mayo.We’re treated to an elevated take on Murcian cuisine, including pani puri balls exploding with tuna tartareWhen I ask Ruiz what sauce he’s plating up, he squirts a dot on to the back of my hand.“Try it,”he grins confidently. It is a delicious homemade saffron mayonnaise with anchovy, lemon and garlic.A frozen cocktail with an umbrella appears moments later, sent from his other bar next door,Colmado San Julián.We finish up and say our goodbyes before wandering over to López’s restaurant. As we enter, he vanishes without a word and we’re seated by a window peering into the kitchen. Dishes soon arrive at the table from his excellent tasting menu (from about £65), which champions local, seasonal ingredients. Standout plates include a wild mushroom dish packed with umami, a deep-flavoured red Calasparra rice with vegetables, and his excellent signature dessert, a cross between a flan and a crème brûlée (a favourite of the legendary Spanish food critic José Carlos Capel).View image in fullscreenFlowers are also handed out at the Bando de la Huerta parade.Photograph: Europa Press News/Europa Press/Getty ImagesThe next day we drive 45 minutes out of town toCasa Borrego– a cosy eight-room gastronomic hotel with soft bucolic rooms and a burbling beck outside. For dinner, we’re treated to an elevated take on Murcian cuisine, includingpani puriballs exploding with tuna tartare, and a massive pan of rich rabbit rice. Retiring to bed, we’re lulled to sleep by the sound of trickling water. With our time in Murcia nearly up, the following day we zip back to the city to hunt down one last dish:zarangollo, a simple courgette-and-egg scramble. We find it at a traditional tapas bar calledBodegón Los Toneles– alljamónlegs and chalkboard menus.We end the trip as we began with a local tipple, this time atCaféLab.Asiáticois a heady blend of condensed milk, Licor 43, cognac and spices – said to hail from Cartagena. Like Murcia’s cuisine, its richness lies in the subtle layers – each one revealing something original, unexpected and distinctly its own.The trip was provided byTurismo de Murcia.Sercotel Amistad Murciahas doubles from around €60 room-only;Casa Borregohas doubles from €120B&BExplore more on these topicsMurcia holidaysFood and drinkSpain holidaysEurope holidaysSpanish food and drinkFoodWine holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pods, pulp, paste, concentrate … I can’t keep up with them all.David, via emailHow doesChaya Maya, development chef atOttolenghi Test Kitchen, love tamarind? Let her count the ways: “It’sdelicious, plus you can use it in sweet and savoury dishes, or to make lemonade, which we do in Mauritius; it has that sour sharpness that makes your mouth tingle. Actually, we need a tamarind movement.” Also in favour of the pucker fruit isMelissa Thompson, author ofMotherland, namely for its “lovely consistency” and ability to “coat things nicely” while adding “depth”.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As David says, tamarind comes in various forms, but let’s start at the very beginning with those peanut-shaped pods, which Thompson likes to snack on – just crack open the shell and eat the flesh. “When I started cheffing, I wanted to do all the processes myself, so I’d buy a box of pods, peel them, soak them and mash them, which took so long!” Perhaps unsurprisingly, these days she prefers a compressed block, which also happens to be Maya’s go-to: “You have to hydrate it, then make a paste, but the blocks last longer, plus the manufacturer will have waited until the tamarind is ripe, so it’s sweet and caramelly.” Perfect, then, for Thompson’s barbecue sauce, which involves breaking off 50g pulp, steeping it in water and combining with apple molasses, but the possibilities are (almost) endless: “A block is the most versatile option, but only for someone who gets through a lot.”Perhaps easier is a jar of paste, which is readily available in supermarkets, or tamarind concentrate. “Depending on where it’s from [predominantly Thailand and India], it tastes quite different, which can cause confusion,” says Feast’s ownHelen Goh, whose first solo book,Baking and the Meaning of Life, is out in September. “I only ever use Thai or Malaysian tamarind, which is fruity, bright, smooth, liquidy and brown; Indian tamarind, by contrast, is darker, almost black, and far more concentrated and intense.” Add a spoonful for instant oomph in soups, stews, meat marinades or anywhere you might otherwise turn to citrus. “It’s not quite the same as a block, but it’s still pretty delicious,” Maya says. “Just watch out when seasoning, because the jarred stuff is often already salted.” She suggests adding lime juice to loosen, then flavouring with crushed garlic, chopped spring onion and fresh chilli, plus salt and sugar to taste. “Roast some fish, pour on the tamarind mix and it’s the best. If you’ve got crispy onions, pile them on top as well.” Thompson, meanwhile, would use her noodle: “Make a dressing by watering down tamarind paste, add vinegar, honey, chopped shallot, garlic, lime juice and zest, and pour over a cold noodle salad.”Pineapple and tamarind are synonymous with Malaysia, where Goh grew up, and she says that duo are particularly welcome in an upside-down cake: “Tamarind concentrate goes into the caramel,which is poured into a cake tin. Lay pineapple on top, pour in the cake batter, then bake – it melts into a gooey, syrupy thing that I love.” There’s also tamarind extract, but Thompson would be inclined to leave that well alone: “People tend to come unstuck with that because it is so concentrated.” That said, it works a dream in vegan fish sauce, which is yet more proof that sweet-sour tamarind really does make everything better.Got a culinary dilemma?

I love the simplicity and elegance of this recipe: it is the perfect balance of sweet and sour, spicy and salty, and it feels special at the same time. Griddle and marinate the peaches ahead of time, if you like, and feel free to switch them for nectarines, apricots or whatever you have to hand that looks good for griddling.Grilled peach, gorgonzola and thyme tartinesPrep5 minCook20 minServes22 peaches(about 200g)Olive oilSea salt andblack pepperA few sprigsfresh thyme1 tbsp honey1 pinch red chilli flakes1 small ciabatta, or half a large one1 garlic clove, peeled and cut in half150g gorgonzolaA handful of rocket leavesPut a griddle pan on a high heat. Halve the peaches, remove the stones and cut the fruit into wedges. Put the wedges in a small bowl, drizzle with a tablespoon of olive oil and season generously. Add the leaves from the thyme sprigs, toss to coat, then griddle the peach slices for a minute or two on each side, until they take on dark char lines and soften slightly. Return them to the bowl, add the honey and chilli flakes, toss again and set aside.Heat the grill to high. Cut the ciabatta in half horizontally and toast under the hot grill for a couple of minutes, until golden and very lightly toasted. Drizzle each slice with olive oil and rub with the cut side of the halved garlic clove.Cut the gorgonzola into ½cm-thick slices and lay these over one side of the ciabatta halves. Return to the grill for just a minute, until oozy, then top with the dressed peaches. Toss the rocket with any remaining dressing in the peach bowl, arrange on top of the tartines and tuck in.Explore more on these topicsFoodFruitCheeseSnacksBreadVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"
