Just to see him on screen was enough to make me smile. That handsome face and head gave him the look of a Roman emperor from Waxahachie, Texas or a three-star general playing the country music circuit. Duvall was famously bald (the rare roles needing hairpieces always looked artificial on him) and so he looked the same age almost all his acting life: forever in his vigorous fortysomething prime – though often playing figures complicated with tenderness and woundedness.Robert Duvall’s 20 best performances – ranked!Read moreDuvall had a long, rich career, starting out with notable roles in To Kill a Mockingbird, M*A*S*H, The Conversation and Network, but it was destiny to be chiefly known for two sensational and very different roles given to him by Francis Ford Coppola at either end of the 1970s. One was Tom Hagen, the quiet, self-effacingconsigliereto the Corleone crime family in The Godfather (1972), with a complex relationship both with the Don himself, played by Marlon Brando, and his youngest son and heir, the coldly imperious Michael, played by Al Pacino. And the second was his extraordinary turn as the surf-crazed Wagner enthusiast Lieutenant Colonel KilgoreinApocalypse Now(1979), who with his “Air Mobile” division of helicopters leads a gigantic attack on a Vietnamese village in broad daylight, with speakers blaring The Ride of the Valkyries – in theory to airlift Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, and his boatful of men into the river’s strategic entry point. But all too clearly, it’s because he just wants an excuse for a whooping and hollering cavalry attack.View image in fullscreenComplex … as Tom Hagen in The Godfather: Part II, with Al Pacino.Photograph: Allstar/Paramount/SportsphotoOn the other hand, Duvall’s Hagen inThe Godfatheris one of his subtlest and most misunderstood performances. He is calm and reserved, an administrator and COO figure of the Corleone corporation; Hagen has to endure insults from Vito’s raging hothead son Sonny (James Caan) that what the family needs is a “wartime”consigliere, not this milksop. When Michael later crisply excludes him from the inner circle, relegating him to the status of his Vegas lawyer, Duvall shows how deeply hurt Hagen is.Robert Duvall: ‘Whatshisname should have won the Oscar’Read moreYet it is mild Hagen who is responsible for the most macabre and legendary act of violence in the whole Godfather canon: the horse’s head in the bed. Vito had tasked him with flying out to Los Angeles to meet a certain movie producer who was refusing to cast Johnny Fontane – the Sinatra-esque singer who is Vito’s godson. The producer diplomatically entertains Hagen to dinner at his lavish Hollywood home, having shown him the racehorse in his stables: his pride and joy. But he still refuses to have anything to do with Fontane. Hagen leaves, apparently accepting the decision. The following morning we see the horrifying result. And we realise that in the intervening eight hours, Hagen has mobilised local muscle to break noiselessly into the producer’s property – with Hagen naturally leading the way as someone who knows the layout – get into the stables, drug the horse, saw its head off, sneak into the producer’s bedroom, place the head between the sheets and silently leave. An extraordinary act of psychopathic ingenuity and daring. Back in New York, Hagen is solicitously asked by the Don if he is tired and Hagen just shrugs that he “slept on the plane”. Later, when Tessio is about to be killed for conspiring against Michael, it is to Hagen that he whines: “Tell Mike it was only business. I always liked him” and even asks for Hagen’s help. Duvall’s face is a mask of contemptuous amusement.There is something of the same steel in the outrageous Kilgore in Apocalypse Now, who booms, shirtless, while squatting athletically down on his haunches to address the men: “I love the smell of napalm in the morning!” – adding with a mysterious hint of regret: “Some day this war’s gonna end.” He has nothing but contempt for the enemy because they don’t understand his love of surfing: “Charlie don’t surf!” And he brushes off a subordinate’s incomprehension: “What do you know about surfing, Major? You’re from goddamned New Jersey!” Duvall delivers these mysterious arias of craziness with absolute conviction.That same year, he had a comparably intimidating role The Great Santini (1979), in which he plays a US marine corps officer, “Bull” Meacham, who is in the habit of playing one-on-one basketball games with his teenage son Ben in the front driveway, and simply cannot accept it when Ben finally beats him. The father bullies and humiliates the son in an unwatchable scene.View image in fullscreenIntimidating … with Michael O’Keefe in The Great Santini.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/AlamyDuvall got his best actor Oscar for a movie that tapped much more into his wistful loneliness: Bruce Beresford’s Tender Mercies in 1983, in which he played Mac Sledge, a country singer who has lost wife, daughter and career to drink. Mac wakes up broke and hungover in a Texas motel room, persuades the manageress (the widow of a fallen Vietnam veteran) to let him stay and winds up marrying her. It’s a lovely, gentle performance from Duvall, who incidentally has a great singing voice and performs two songs of his own composition: Fool’s Waltz and I’ve Decided to Leave Here Forever. The whole movie is itself like a country song, melancholy and a little mawkish, with Duvall at its centre.But my favourite of Duvall’s films is the one that resembles Tender Mercies more than a little, in its story of mysterious spiritual redemption in the American heartland. It was Duvall’s own passion project: The Apostle (1997), in which he was writer, producer, director and star. He is the low-church preacher Euliss F “EF” Dewey, who has lost his wife and children to the booze. Drunk, he shows up at his kid’s baseball match and fatally hits his estranged wife’s new boyfriend with a bat; he goes on the run, winding up in Louisiana where, through sheer force of will and preaching eloquence, he sets up a new church and becomes a much-loved figure in the town.Duvall created a lovely, almost Hardyesque story with The Apostle, a kind of Mayor of Casterbridge for the deep south. It was entered for the Un Certain Regard section in Cannes; I think it should have been in competition, and could have carried off the Palme. EF is not supposed to be an ironic or sinister figure in any way, despite his crime, and his lack of obvious repentance. It is genuinely sad when his courtship of a local woman (Miranda Richardson) doesn’t work out, and gripping when he confronts a local bigot (Billy Bob Thornton). And it is very moving when he conducts his final service in his little church as the police gather outside, having agreed to let him finish. This is a glorious performance from Duvall, with something playful in the flights of preaching fancy, especially when holding forth on the radio, in a sporting stance at the microphone, one foot forward, the other back, he bellows genially about “holy ghost power!”Duvall always had power, and a little of that power has left the movies today.Explore more on these topicsRobert DuvallFrancis Ford  CoppolaOscarsThe GodfatherApocalypse NowAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 11th Earl of Northesk won bronze ahead of his teammate, and the pre-race favourite, Lord Brabazon of Tara. It is some legacy. After a century of competition, skeleton is the only Winter Olympic sport in which Britain lead the all-time medal table.Winter Olympics 2026: Loïc Meillard wins men’s slalom; speed skating, bobsleigh and more – liveRead moreWhich figures. Skeleton is, believe it or not, a British invention even though there is not a track or enough snow to dust the hundred or so miles of ski pistes in the country. Like so much else about modern sport, it is all down to the Victorians, who took it up on the natural ice track in St Moritz when the town was a regular stop on the Grand Tour. In the early 20th century, the speed limit on British roads was capped at 20mph. If you wanted to go really fast, you needed to get to St Moritz and the legendary Cresta Run.Back then, the Cresta was the only skeleton venue in the world, which is why the sport was included in the programme when Games were hosted in St Moritz. The International Olympic Committee decided to make it a regular event from the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City onwards and the small British federation secured just enough funding from UK Sport to set up a training base and employ the Austrian former world champion Andi Schmid as head coach. It paid off when the former track athleteAlex Coomber won bronzein the women’s event that year.Great Britain won two medals at those Games and, because the UK had just brought in performance-related funding, Coomber’s bronze meant the programme secured the money it needed to build 140 metres of concrete practice track at the University of Bath and set up a Talent ID scheme. For years, British sliding sports had relied on the close links between that original Cresta set and the armed forces for its athletes, Coomber was a serving RAF member, but now it was opened up to anyone who was fit and willing to have a go.View image in fullscreenAlex Coomber won bronze in the women’s skeleton at the 2002 Winter Olympics.Photograph: Dan Chung/The GuardianWhich is how Amy Williams, Lizzy Yarnold, Shelley Rudman, Laura Deas, Dom Parsons, Weston and Stoecker came to the sport. Skeleton is well suited to this sort of late take-up. Luge racers go feet first from a seated start, which means it is considered safer at an earlier age, and the racers that excel at it have been doing it since they were children. A skeleton racer, on the other hand, needs three things.One is explosive launching ability, another is an extraordinary sense of proprioception, the body’s unconscious, eighth sense, that allows them to make the tiny steering adjustments they need to stay on the right line when they are travelling at 90mph. Weston developed his in taekwondo. Stoecker learned hers in circus school.Here is the awkward bit. The third thing is money. Because a lot of it is all about the kit Great Britain puts more money into all this than almost any other nation. Skeleton got its name because the sled was so rudimentary, but these days the British programme is a very hi-tech endeavour.Team GB slider Matt Weston: ‘I don’t ever stand at the top aiming for anything less than gold’Read moreUK Sport spent £5.8m on it during this past Olympic cycle and that money paid for the services of the man widely regarded as the world’s greatest skeleton racer, the Latvian six-time world champion Martins Dukurs and all his proprietary sled tech, as well as cutting-edge sleds, suits and training tools. That includes a flight simulator and what Weston describes as “the secret stuff” he has used in his preparation. The money also means, Weston says, “we’re unusual in the way we operate compared to other nations”. GB can afford to run a centralised programme that continues through the summer.The German team run a similar sort of budget and unlike Great Britain they have the benefit of having four functioning ice tracks to practise on. They also have €50m worth of research and design input, although it is spread between luge, skeleton and bobsled, which they utterly dominate. But some of the other countries competing here are living off scraps.Skeleton is expensive: it costs just over $50,000 (£36,600) a year to practise it in the US and a lot of the athletes have to raise that money themselves through crowdfunding. They are living off charity in Canada, too, after cuts to the funding for the Canadian federation.Some of the men and women the British athletes are competing against in Cortina are riding old sleds held together with gaffer tape and because funding for these sports always depends on performance, it all becomes grimly cyclical: the worse you do, the less you get; the less you get, the worse you do.Money matters. So long as it keeps flowing there is probably another British Olympic champion or two waiting somewhere among those 3,500 volunteers.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBWinter OlympicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Why are we squeezing graduates harder than the super-rich?Gaby HinsliffReform of this stealth tax is long overdue – and with it, a shake-up of the whole university systemMon 16 Feb 2026 12.38 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 14.09 ESTShareNever go to war with Martin Lewis. The one iron law of politics is that the financial guru who built moneysavingexpert.com has a quasi-godlike status in Britain, the man millions trust with their cash in a way they would never trust any politician. If he takes up a cause, he usually wins. So when Lewisjoined the revoltagainst recent changes to the student loan system, urging young graduates to lobby their MPs in protest, trouble was never going to be far behind.And now apparently it’s here. Last week, the Green party leader, Zack Polanski,called for“a conversation about student debt forgiveness”, echoing arallying cryamong young Democrat voters at the last US election for loans to be written off faster (though he didn’t explain where he would find the billions that would cost). Shortly afterwards, five former education secretaries – including Labour’s David Blunkett –publicly backeda Sunday Times campaign for admittedly more modest reforms to student finance. It looks like the slow-burning anger of graduates who went to university in England and Wales between 2012 and 2023 – on a plan that walloped them withhigher interest ratesthan those who went before or after – is finally starting to set Westminster alight.Student loan repayments of up to 9% means some of theseso-called Plan 2graduatesface effective marginal tax ratesof 49% or more, in England and Wales, where even the super-rich pay only 45%. It’s a generational injustice that rankles: why are young people being squeezed proportionately harder in some cases than their bosses? Isn’t it tough enough already to save up for a first flat, or start a family, without hanging yet more millstones round their necks?NUS urges ‘loan shark’ Reeves to reverse changes to student debt repaymentRead moreAnd then there’s the dispiriting sense of throwing money into a bottomless pit. Since only the highest earners will ever contribute enough to outrun that galloping interest rate and actually clear the loan, many of the rest are now realising that despite years of conscientiously paying their dues, their debts have actuallygrownrather than shrunk. (Even when you’re on maternity leave, the interest keeps ticking up relentlessly.) The 29-year-old Labour backbencher Nadia Whittomerecently pointed outthat even she has managed to make only a £1,000 dent in her £49,600 debt after six years on an MP’s salary, so how on earth is anyone else supposed to do it? Though anything this crop of graduates still owes will be written off after 30 years, that still potentially leaves them paying well into middle age for decisions made back in sixth form.What really tipped rebellious graduates over the edge, however, was the chancellor Rachel Reeves’ decision in the budget tofreeze the threshold(the salary level where graduates have to start repaying) at £29,385 for Plan 2 until 2030, squeezing a few more millions out of them. Her argument that graduates are now better off, thanks to falling interest rates, cut no ice with Lewis, who argues that it’s not what graduates signed up to, and that moving the goalposts like thisisn’t“a moral thing” to do. Enter the Greens, who promised in their last manifesto to scrap student loans altogether, and who are now palpably keen to capitalise on what the pollster YouGov says is anemerging lead over Labouramong the under-30s.Student debt forgiveness never used to feature in political conversation on this side of the Atlantic, but then nor did leaving college withaverage debts of £53,000– or more if you do a master’s, as young people increasingly feel panicked into doing if they want to bolster their CVs in a hideously competitive jobs market. (Startlingly, English students now graduate withhigher average debtseven than Americans, whose system has always been a byword for cripplingly expensive fees.) If anything, the backlash is only likely to grow as the next lot of post-2023 students – who faithfully did what their teachers said they should do and worked hard to get to university – begin graduating into a jobs market that didn’t have enough genuine graduate opportunities to go round, even before AI started gobbling up entry-level work.View image in fullscreenChancellor Rachel Reeves visiting the OpenReach training centre in Crawley, West Sussex, on Thursday 12 February.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAI was speaking at a university careers fair at the weekend, packed with almost frighteningly impressive students who are keen enough to turn up on a Sunday to polish their internship applications but who still find themselves wading through rejection letter after rejection letter. This is the supposed golden ticket for which, after graduating, some may be expected to pay for in their 60s. (Though thankfully they face lower interest rates than the Plan 2 generation, which ought to make the debt easier to clear, these younger graduates will start repaying earlier – in fact as soon asthey earn £25,000, dangerously close to what will soon be minimum wage – and for longer, with debt only finally written offafter 40 years).Britain may well now be at the beginning of a painful transition towards higher taxes for everyone,at least if it wants both tofix its public services and bolster its defences against arising global threatin a hurry. The long peace dividend that made things like free university education possible is over, replaced by what might be called the Trump tax, or the unwanted price of living in a world made more dangerous by the US losing its bearings. But to start that transition by squeezing the young, rather than those old enough to have actually benefited from the good times while they lasted, feels completely backwards. If we are in this, the generations should all be in it together.The Guardian view on student loans: a graduate levy by stealth is no way to fund the NHS | EditorialRead moreThe fairest option is probably to cap how much any student should have to pay over their lifetime, so that loans bear some resemblance to what was borrowed rather than just morphing into a kind of stealth graduate tax. But that would be expensive, most likely requiring a shake-up of the university system into the bargain.Though more apprenticeships might be part of the answer, they can’t simply be magicked out of thin air. (Apprentices need actual work to learn on, which requires an economy growing strongly enough to create it.) If anything, the UK has spent too long arguing in circles about how many people should go to university and not enough time thinking about what they do when they get there. One option is to offer shorter and cheaper degrees, compressing three years’ study into two – which should be easier than it was, given how many universities have already cut teaching time or shifted to teaching over two semesters rather than three terms.But if the government has better options, then let’s hear them sooner rather than later. The young, unsurprisingly, are in a hurry.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Let’s start with the easy bit: Victoria Derbyshire is the ideal interlocutor. The co-presenter of Newsnight has a kind of steely warmth that meshes well with the innate dignity of Mme Pelicot – as she is called throughout – while they walk unflinchingly through her terrible story.Her “descent into hell” began on 2 November 2020 when the local police called her and her husband, Dominique Pelicot, to the station. They believed it was to do with his recent arrest for covertly taking pictures underneath the skirts of three women in the supermarket. It was not. In the course of that investigation they had found on his laptop thousands upon thousands of videos and photographs accumulated over a decade of his wife unconscious and being raped by strangers.They showed Mme Pelicot a handful of images. She barely recognised herself, dressed in underwear she didn’t own, and she didn’t recognise the men. “Something exploded inside me,” she tells Derbyshire. She didn’t put a name to what she had seen until many hours later, when she was at home and told a friend: “Dominique raped me and had me raped.” He had her raped by at least 70 men. They were drawn – notes Derbyshire in a piece to camera at the top of the programme, as the names of the convicted fill the screen – from within a 30-mile radius of their home in Mazan, the tiny, beautiful little Provencal town to which they had retired some years before. Fifty-two – plus Mme Pelicot’s husband – were identified by the police, and after a three-month trial most were convicted of aggravated rape, two of sexual assault and two of attempted rape. Dominique received the maximum sentence of 20 years.View image in fullscreenGisèle Pelicot and Newsnight’s Victoria Derbyshire.Photograph: BBCDerbyshire’s questioning is not blunt, but it is straightforward. It would be an insult to Mme Pelicot and her proven ability to survive unthinkable traumas to be anything else. She famously waived her right to anonymity on the grounds that “shame must change sides”; it belongs not to the rape victim but to the rapists. It is usually said that she has become a feminist icon as a result, but really it is more specific than that. She has become a repository of hope and – though it has become a devalued word in the age of Instagram – an inspiration to all women across the globe, including rape victims who have not (yet) brought charges, or who belong tothe estimated 30% of the female populationwho have experienced physical and/or sexual violence, overwhelmingly at male hands (in March 2025,the ONS said that 98% of victims stated that their attacker was male).It is, perhaps counterintuitively, good to hear Mme Pelicot tell Derbyshire how her reactions and her thinking evolved regarding the question of anonymity. Initially, she wanted the usual closed hearing. “I certainly didn’t want to be seen,” she says, feeling that “the filthy stain stays with you for life”. But the four years “I carried that shame” between the discovery of her abuse and the trial gave her time to think and come to the conclusion that such “self-inflicted pain … meant that victims were being punished twice. And I thought that if I could overcome it, all victims could do it too. I’m sure of it. They must not lose confidence.”Caroline Darian, daughter of Gisèle Pelicot, speaks: ‘How can you rebuild when your father is the worst sexual predator in decades?’Read moreSitting, perfectly calm, effortlessly poised, even when occasionally moved to tears, even when explaining how and why her husband had to mix muscle relaxants in with the sedatives he gave her so that she would “slacken and dilate” enough not to be in pain the next day from what the men did to her unconsenting body (and realise something was wrong), Mme Pelicot cuts an extraordinary figure. You can only gaze in admiration at her strength and grace, and hope beyond measure that she can sustain the rapprochement with her daughter, Caroline – another suspected victim of Dominique, who is also under investigation for the attempted rape of a woman in 1999 (which he has admitted) and the murder of another in 1991, which he denies.But behind every examination of the Pelicot case a question lurks. How many people out there are reading or watching or listening not in abject horror but in thrall? How many men are out there thinking: “I wish, I wish …” or “I could, I could …”? Is that a morbid or a realistic question to be asking? Last month former Tory councillor Philip Young pleaded guilty to nearly 50 counts of drugging, raping and sexually assaulting his former wife, Joanne, who has also waived her anonymity. Another man has pleaded guilty to raping her, too. It’s hard not to think of the 30-mile radius around you and wonder.Gisèle Pelicot: The Newsnight Interview aired on BBC Two and is available on iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewGisèle PelicotreviewsShareReuse this content"

So what made him write a comedy about two men waiting?Mon 16 Feb 2026 10.33 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 12.55 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleGary Wilmot has had many lives. A children’s TV presenter turned variety show host turned panto marvel turned musicals sensation, Wilmot has now turned his hand back to playwriting. His London debut is a comedy about two men, waiting. One is chill, the other restless; both become bonded by the wait. Very Samuel Beckett, isn’t it? The men could be Vladimir and Estragon, no?“Funny you should say that,” Wilmot says, sitting at Upstairs at the Gatehouse, the theatre above a pub in London that is staging While They Were Waiting, in which he also stars, opposite Steve Furst. Soon after the play was commissioned, he was asked if he had been influenced by Beckett’s existential play Waiting for Godot. He’d never seen it but it just so happened there was a production in the West End starring Ben Whishaw and Lucian Msamati. Wilmot went, saw it and left nonplussed. “I thought, ‘There’s a reason I’ve never seen this. I haven’t got a clue what’s going on.’”I remember as a six-year-old dancing around, wiggling my bum and miming to the song My Boy LollipopThat’s an admission not every actor would dare make. “Well, I am honest about things,” he says, and it’s true – Wilmot is full of refreshing candour that sounds like comic self-deprecation at times, perhaps with a calculation to disarm and entertain. Instantly likable, he is measured in tone and, aged 71, still bearing a kind of ageless bounce.“I sat in a workshop ofPaddington the Musicala few years ago,” he says, following up on the Beckett story. Does he mean the theatrical juggernaut currently in the West End? “Yes, it was being workshopped and I was playing [the equivalent of]Hugh Grant’s characterfrom the film. This character had been crowbarred in … so at the end of the workshop, when we were sitting chatting with the producers and director, I said: ‘I’m going to do myself out of a job here but why is my character in this? He’s just so disjointed from everything else.’”View image in fullscreenBonding experience … Wilmot and Steve Furst in rehearsals for While They Were Waiting.Photograph: Simon JacksonHe did indeed do himself out of a job, and that character vanished from the script. Wilmot has no regrets. It’s about entertainment, he says, not ego.That motto’s clearly worked for Wilmot, whose career has stretched across more than half a century. For a certain generation, he is a household name. A finalist in TV reality contest New Faces in the late 1970s, and the boundlessly energetic presenter of 80s children’s shows such as So You Want to Be Top?, he graduated to hosting his own variety series and became a staple on primetime TV for years. But younger generations, he points out with no hint of offence, have never heard of him.Still he has never been short of work, thanks to some canny repurposing of his skill-set. When TV variety hit obsolescence he went into musical theatre, excelling as the cockney gent Bill Snibson in Me and My Girl, and shining as Yale man Elisha J Whitney in the Olivier-winning Anything Goes, among others. There’s a tenacity to Wilmot that seems admirably old-school, a will to get out on the road, to push himself on, no matter what size the venue or audience. He has written two plays before now which were staged at his village hall in Tring in Hertfordshire, including one called Horse which, he explains, is about a man who thinks he’s a horse (I hold back on comparisons with Peter Shaffer’s Equus after the Beckett misfire). So a quiet king of reinvention, then, it would seem? No, he says, none of these gyrations have been premeditated. “I wasn’t ambitious until about 10 years ago,” he says, but he is a natural shapeshifter: “I’ve always been one for looking for new things.”He left school when he was 15, barely able to read and write. “It was comprehensive school education [in south London] which comprehensively failed me. I couldn’t wait to get out.” He didn’t think of showbusiness as a career for himself, even for a minute, but his friends did. “They thought I was funny, they decided to push me, one guy in particular. It’s funny how some people come into your life for a brief moment and affect it for ever. He said he’d met a theatrical agent. He gave me his business card and said, ‘I’ve told him you’re brilliant.’”View image in fullscreenWilmot with Sutton Foster and Felicity Kendal in the Cole Porter musical Anything Goes,Photograph: Ian West/PAWilmot was 21, working as a scaffolder and forklift driver. The agent put him in touch with an impressionist giving tuition to young performers. For £5 an hour, he learned the basics and began gigging. “I found something that everyone else thought I was good at, so I carried on doing it. But I think I knew from day one that it was a good feeling to make people laugh. I remember as a six-year-old dancing around, wiggling my bum and miming to My Boy Lollipop.”As someone who began his career on a TV talent show, he thinks the format back then was first and foremost about finding new talent. “Now it seems to me to be about maintaining the profile of the panellists rather than finding new talent that’s going to have longevity. If you ask someone who won X Factor last year they wouldn’t have a clue, but 10 years after [Wilmot’s professional partner] Judy and I won New Faces, people were saying ‘Oh, you’re the guy from New Faces.’”View image in fullscreen‘My friends thought I was funny and decided to push me’ … Wilmot doing standup on ITV’s Saturday Gang in 1986.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockAlthough he was given few leg-ups, Wilmot did have entertaining in his blood; his father was a professional singer in a group called the Southlanders. The song they were known for wasI Am a Mole and I Live in a Hole, says Wilmot, singing it in a baritone. “My dad was the bass voice.” Jamaican-born and raised, Harry Wilmot came to Britain on the Empire Windrush in 1948, and fell in love with Wilmot’s white British mother. They would have been a very visible anomaly as a mixed-raced couple in postwar Britain.“It’s only when I had kids of my own that I realised how difficult it must have been for her,” he reflects. “She was a dancer, and her dance partner was her brother. When my dad came along he disowned her, completely and utterly.” She died in 1978, just as Wilmot was on the brink of his TV breakthrough. “She didn’t see New Faces. It would have been nice for her to see it,” he says, and his understated tone is all the more moving.He speaks in the same tender tones about his father, who died when Wilmot was just seven. It sounds, from his stories, as if he has been searching for him in adult life. “One time, I was rehearsing a musical in south London and I’d seen posters for a Windrush exhibition at the Imperial War Museum.” He went along and saw footage of a BBC report from the deck of the Windrush, in which he recognised his father being interviewed. “I said to a stranger, ‘That’s my dad!’”View image in fullscreenThat’s my dad!’ … Harry Wilmot, centre, in a famous photograph showing men coming to Britain on the Empire Windrush.Photograph: Douglas Miller/Getty ImagesThen there is the famous Windrush photo that features his father: “It’s two guys standing and in the middle is a guy sitting on a crate. My dad’s the one in the middle. They are all very dapper. I met one of the guys recently at an exhibition at the British Library. He was in a wheelchair and I said, ‘You were in that photograph with my dad. What was he was like?’ He told me he didn’t know him. The photographer had said, ‘You, you and you, come here’, which is what photographers do.”Did Wilmot feel anger when the Windrush scandal broke? “No I just felt like everybody. Any sane person would have gone, ‘This guy’s 60, he’s been working in this country …”If 1960s Britain was hard on his mother, it wasn’t exactly easy for him or his brother either. “We were two Black boys in a predominantly white community with a white mother.” Then again, he says, there was a fierce sense of neighbourliness on his Lambeth estate. “Everyone in my block was [called] auntie or uncle. If I came home and my mum was at an appointment at the hospital, my aunt Lou next door would say, ‘Come and have some tea with me.’ That’s what you did.”He and his brother had a reunion about 25 years ago with all the boys they grew up with on the estate, and 54 men turned up, he says. “Not only did I know all 54 blokes, I knew their brothers and sisters, I knew their parents. We were in the banqueting room of a hotel and had a wonderful time. There was still this feeling of community, but of those 54 blokes, only one still lived on the estate. We were all encouraged to go out.”What about racism as a child? Whatever he got, he gave back tenfold, he answers. “If a guy had acne, or big ears, or was lanky or short and he had a go at me, I would give it back.” Maybe it’s how his humour developed, he thinks. But the first time he felt being Black affected him was when he started doing theatre in the 90s, “when the colour of your skin meant you couldn’t play certain roles”.View image in fullscreen‘I knew from day one it was a good feeling to make people laugh’ … playing the dame in Jack and the Beanstalk in 2014.Photograph: Jane Hobson/ShutterstockIt was pointed out to him, he says. “When I went into Me and My Girl, I was nobody’s idea of an archetypal cockney character from 1930s. But I was more like him than any of the guys who had played it before because I knew that character. I’m delighted to say they recognised that in me and gave me the role.”‘A split second of sheer terror – and we’re off’: Lucian Msamati on Waiting for Godot’s electrifying first nightRead moreNow things may have swung too much the other way, he feels. “If there are two actors auditioning for Martin Luther King and one of them looks like him, and when he reads the ‘I have a dream’ speech you think ‘strong contender’ … but then in comes a guy who is a much, much better actor. Just because the first guy is Black, doesn’t mean he understands what was going on with Martin Luther King and what America and the world were going through. So on comes the actor who really gets to the root of the character, and when he gives you that speech you think, ‘I never knew what that speech meant until he told me.’”But the white actor hasn’t had racial abuse shouted at him on the street. “No,” says Wilmot, “but he’s touched your emotion.” So the discourse on authenticity is misguided? “I do think there’s a certain amount of box-ticking going on, but in a funny way I’m quite pleased with that because it means Black and Brown performers get an opportunity to improve, to work with the best.“But the overriding point is that this isn’t the real world. It’s a made-up world and it’s up to us to get the audience to believe the lies we’re telling.”While They Were Waiting is at Upstairs at the Gatehouse, in London, from 26 February until 22 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsEntertainment TVinterviewsShareReuse this content"

I recognise that many of the local councils undergoing reorganisation voiced genuine concerns about the pressure they are under as we seek to deliver the most ambitious reforms of local government in a generation.”Farage said Reed should resign as a result, while Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader,called the move“predictable chaos from a useless government that cannot make basic decisions”.Several Labour MPs also voiced anger at the decision, which they said showed there should never have been plans to delay the elections. “Most councillors feel devastated,” said one Labour MP for an affected area. “Many didn’t want to cancel the elections. They felt pressurised into it and didn’t feel they had the resources to deliver the planned local government reorganisation too.”View image in fullscreenReed said on Monday that ‘all local elections in May 2026 will now go ahead’.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Getty ImagesReed said on Monday that the government would give affected councils an extra £63m to cover the administrative costs, promising further support should they request it.Local leaders say they will now have to rehire venues as polling stations and find returning officers at short notice to be able to carry out the elections as demanded.“This most recent announcement means that 30 councils will now have to run elections within an even more constrained timetable,” the Local Government Information Unit said. “This risks the successful delivery of elections in all of these places, not to mention the additional strain it will needlessly add to the workloads of dedicated staff.”Officials said the decision had been taken because they received legal advice warning they were likely to lose the case against Farage, which was due to be heard on Thursday and Friday. The Reform leaderwas expected to arguethat the delays were “patently irrational” and contravened democratic and individual rights.Reed announced earlier this year that he had accepted applications from 30 local authorities to delay their elections because of the resources required to carry out the government’s planned local government reorganisation. That reorganisation will result in district and county councils being merged into unitary authorities in some areas, and neighbouring councils merged in others.One government source said the local government secretary was warned at the time the decision was likely to face a legal challenge. Only in recent days, however, did lawyers decide ministers were likely to lose that challenge.With days to go until the high court was due to hear Farage’s case, Reed turned the decision over to the housing minister, Matthew Pennycook, who advised the policy should be dropped. Government aides said this was a normal way for legally sensitive decisions to be taken. Those close to the prime minister say he was not involved in making the decision, but say he retains faith in Reed, one of his closest allies in government.The Conservatives are putting pressure on the government to publish the legal advice that prompted the U-turn, the latest in a series of policy reversals that also includes abandoning cuts to benefits and dropping plans for higher taxes for farmers. They are also demanding to know how much it could end up costing taxpayers beyond the additional funding announced by Reed on Monday and the expected legal costs.James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary, wrote in a letter to Reed on Monday: “There are now serious questions about your personal propriety as a minister … If you are unable or unwilling to answer these questions, you should resign.”That message was echoed by Farage, who told reporters at an event in Essex on Monday: “If a minister acts in a way that’s illegal and tries to cancel people’s democratic rights to vote whilst they’re still being charged their council tax, I personally think that it really is a resignation matter.”Reform believes it will be the biggest political winner from the decision, with the party targeting many of the areas in which elections will now be held in May. Farage said on Monday he believed voters in those parts of the country would “punish” the government when they got a chance to vote in May – a sentiment shared by some on the Labour benches.“Councillors feel like the rug has been taken from underneath them,” said one Labour MP. “Now they will have to face angry electors.”Explore more on these topicsLocal electionsLocal politicsLocal governmentEnglandKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

To me, he was simply everything. His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court. For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented. In doing so, he leaves something lasting and unforgettable to us all.”Duvall was perhaps best known for his role as the cavalry-hatted Kilgore inApocalypse Now, released in 1979, which yielded two of the most frequently quoted lines of dialogue in cinema history – “Charlie don’t surf!” and “I love the smell of napalm in the morning”. But he also made an immense impact as theconsigliereTom Hagen inThe GodfatherandThe Godfather Part II, the reclusive Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird at the start of his career, and many supporting and character roles throughout the ensuing decades. He was nominated seven times for an Oscar, winning once, for best actor in 1984 for Tender Mercies as a country-music singer trying to overcome alcoholism.Francis Ford Coppola, who directed Duvall inThe Godfatherfilms, The Rain People, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now, wrote on social media: “What a blow to learn of the loss of Robert Duvall. Such a great actor and such an essential part of [Coppola’s production company with George Lucas] American Zoetrope from its beginning.”Duvall’s Godfather co-star Al Pacino said it had been an honour to work with the actor. Pacino said: “He was a born actor as they say, his connection with it, his understanding and his phenomenal gift will always be remembered. I will miss him.”Robert De Niro, who played Duvall’s brother in the thriller True Confessions and also co-starred in The Godfather: Part II, wrote: “God bless Bobby. I hope I can live till I’m 95. May he rest in peace.”“The greatest consigliere the screen has ever seen,”​wrotethe actor Jamie Lee Curtis on social media, referring to Duvall’s role in the Godfather films as the Corleone family’s lawyer, Tom Hagen.​Adam Sandler, who acted alongside Duvall in Hustled (2022), ​​saidof Duvall: “Funny as hell. Strong as hell. One of the greatest actors we ever had. Such a great man to talk to and laugh with. Loved him so much. We all did. So many movies to choose from that were legendary. Watch them when you can.”Turner Classic Movies​paid tributeto the actor, saying “Duvall’s storytelling transcended mediums and generations of audiences” and the TCM host Ben Manckiewiczsaidit was “hard not to love everything about Robert Duvall’s work”.Born in San Diego, California, in 1931, the son of a naval officer, Duvall studied drama at college in St Louis, Missouri, and briefly joined the army. In 1955 he enrolled at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York (alongside James Caan, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman), sharing flats with Hackman and Hoffman. Duvall worked steadily in TV and theatre, including an award-winning role in a 1965 production of Arthur Miller’s A View from the Bridge, directed by Ulu Grosbard, and won his first film role as the mysterious Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird, released in 1962.View image in fullscreen‘Charlie don’t surf!’ … Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now.Photograph: Allstar/United ArtistsFurther small roles in Bullitt (1968) and True Grit (1969) consolidated his reputation, but it was his role inM*A*S*H– as the self-important Frank Burns, who is repeatedly mocked by Donald Sutherland’s Hawkeye and Elliott Gould’s Trapper John – that brought him to wider attention. Having appeared in Francis Ford Coppola’s feminist road movie The Rain People (1969), Duvall cemented his connection with the Hollywood new wave with the lead role in George Lucas’s 1970 debut feature, the dystopian sci-fi parable THX 1138; Tom Hagen in the first two Godfather films (he would ultimately not be cast in the third due to salary demands); and Kilgore in Apocalypse Now, in a role initially intended for Hackman.Duvall also continued to appear in more mainstream films, including the second world war thriller The Eagle Has Landed (1976), news-media satire Network (1976) and baseball drama The Natural (1984). He made his directorial debut in 1983 with Angelo My Love, a semi-improvised drama about a Romany street kid in New York. Despite his Oscar for Tender Mercies, lead roles rarely came his way, but he was a commanding supporting presence throughout the 80s and 90s, appearing in a wide range of films: the Dennis Hopper-directed gang thriller Colors, the Tom Cruise stock car blockbuster Days of Thunder (1990) and the Margaret Atwood adaptation The Handmaid’s Tale (1990).View image in fullscreenMulti-award-winning … Duvall, right, with Roshan Seth in the HBO’s Stalin.Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/NovofilmIn 1992, he returned to TV to play Stalin in an award-winning HBO filmdirected by Ivan Passer. Another lead role came his way in 1997, in his second directorial effort, The Apostle, in which he plays a preacher who kills his wife’s lover. He received his third best actor Oscar nomination for the role.Duvall would direct two more films – Assassination Tango in 2002, in which he displayed his real-life talent for the Argentinian dance style, and the westernWild Horsesin 2015. He continued to appear in a wide variety of films, from Hollywood thrillers such asThe Gingerbread ManandGone in 60 Seconds, to left-field dramas such asWe Own the NightandThe Road. A longtime interest in football (the “association” kind) led to roles in the low-budget Scottish dramaA Shot at Glory(opposite Ally McCoist) in 2000, and the comedy Kicking and Screaming (2005) with Will Ferrell.View image in fullscreenThe consigliere … Duvall, right, with Al Pacino in The Godfather Part II.Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar/ParamountDuvall continued working steadily through the 2010s, achieving another Oscar nomination for best supporting actor in 2015 forThe Judge, becoming at the time the oldest male actor ever nominated.One of Hollywood’s most prominent Republican supporters for decades, Duvall said he gave up supporting the party in 2014.Duvall was married four times: to Barbara Benjamin (1964-81), to Gail Youngs (1982-86), to Sharon Brophy (1991-95) and to Luciana Pedraza, whom he married in 2005.

He squeezed everything out of every moment.“When we skied together, he was at his happiest. He always said there was no better feeling in life, skiing fresh powder was pure freedom.”Benoît Bachelet, the Albertville prosecutor, said a manslaughter investigation had been launched. The ski instructor, who was uninjured, tested negative for drugs.This incident follows the death ofanother British skierin his 50s in an avalanche at the nearby La Plagne resort in January.Thirteen backcountry skiers, climbers and hikers died in the Italian mountains in the first week of February amid unstable snow conditions.Atrain was derailedby a snow slide in Switzerland on Monday as large areas of the western Alps remained under a high risk of avalanche.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeEurope weatherSkiingnewsShareReuse this content"

Just marry me.”In an email exchange from 21 September 2011, she apparently wrote: “Don’t know if you are still on this bbm but heard from The Duke that you have had a baby boy.“Even though you never kept in touch, I still am here with love, friendship and congratualtions (sic) on your baby boy. Sarah xx”The email is then followed up with a message saying: “You have disappeared … I did not even know you were having a baby. It was soooo crystal clear to me that you were only friends with me to get to Andrew. And that really hurt me deeeply (sic). More than you will know.”Many of the exchanges are dated after Epstein was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a child.Recent revelations from the Epstein files include that Ferguson thanked the convicted sex offender for being the “brother” she “always wished for” in 2009, and that she “humbly”apologisedto her “dear friend” a month after publicly disowning him in 2011.Earlier this month, Ferguson’s charity Sarah’s Trustannouncedit would close “for the foreseeable future” after details of her relationship with Epstein emerged, while seven other charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust,cut ties and revoked Ferguson’s patronage.The publication of a new bookwas cancelled last autumn, leading to thousands of copies being pulped, after she was stripped of her royal divorcee title of the Duchess of York.A representative for the former duchess has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsSarah FergusonJeffrey EpsteinAndrew Mountbatten-WindsornewsShareReuse this content"

However, Trump’s recent threats against Nato allies over Greenland have amplified concerns that an over-reliance on US companies could put UK payments – and the wider economy – at risk.About 95% of UK card transactions are made using payment systems owned by Mastercard and Visa, according to a2025 report by the UK’s Payment Systems Regulator.That dominance has become far more relevant as cash use across the country continues to decline.The Guardian view on Europe’s payments problem: sovereignty starts at the till | EditorialRead more“If Mastercard and Visa were turned off, it would send us back to the 1950s,” before cards dominated the UK economy, and businesses wholly relied on cash, one executive familiar with the project told the Guardian. “Of course, we need a sovereign payments system.”The potential disruption could be vast. In Russia, where businesses are reliant on Visa and Mastercard for 60% of payments, US sanctions that forced the companies toturn off their servicesleft ordinary people stranded without access to funds and unable to buy goods.Similar concerns are being raised in the EU, where politicians have taken a vocal stance on building locally owned networks that could not be turned off on a whim by foreign powers. The chair of the European parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee, Aurore Lalucq, issued astark warningthat went viral last month about relying on US companies for such an essential service.“Visa, Mastercard … the urgent issue is our payment system. Trump can cut everything off,” Lalucq said. “The rest is poetry. I urgently request that the commission organise a European Airbus for payment systems: you can’t say you weren’t warned.”However, the UK is taking a less aggressive stance, with Visa and Mastercard working within the initiative.Both companies are part of the new funders group, giving them a stake and a say alongside a large number of banks and payment companies including Santander UK, NatWest, Nationwide, LloydsBankingGroup, the ATM network body Link, and Coventry Building Society.While UK officials have stressed the need for a backup, they have stopped short of calling out US threats as the source of their nervousness.TheBank of Englanddeputy governor Sarah Breeden also said in a recent speech: “In the context of a challenging and changing cyber and operational risk environment, it could provide a degree of extra resilience in the UK payments landscape, as an additional payment rail on the rare occasion of operational disruption to existing rails.”Joe Garner, the former Nationwide chief executive who worked as a government adviser on Rachel Reeves’ national payments vision, and who led a 2023 independent review on payments, told the Guardian: “Regardless of any political developments, the UK needs to do this. We needed to before, we need to now … I don’t think that’s changed by recent events.”City funders will be in charge of creating the legal structure, leadership plans and future funding models of the new payments alternative, which is known as DeliveryCo. The Bank, meanwhile, will develop infrastructure blueprints that will be handed over to the group next year.It is understood that the new payments system is likely to be in place by 2030.Mastercard and Visa said they were committed to the UK and welcomed competition.Visa said that included providing consumers and business with “access to innovative, secure digital payments with the highest levels of resilience and reliability. We welcome the industry progress on account-to-account payments in the UK. We believe competition between multiple solutions, supported by a level playing field, will deliver choice, innovation and economic growth in the UK.”Mastercard said: “Mastercard has been fully invested in the UK for decades, delivering consumers and businesses with a wide range of convenient, simple and secure ways to pay and get paid. We remain committed to drive commerce here at home and across the globe by helping businesses of all sizes grow and meet the needs of their customers.”The trade association UK Finance, which has been providing administrative support to the DeliveryCo project, declined to comment.The Treasury was contacted for comment.

It’s not rocket science,” said van Aalst, who used to lead the climate centre at the International Red Cross and Red Crescent and is now the director general of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI).The ESABCC describes current efforts to adapt to rising temperatures as “insufficient, largely incremental [and] often coming too late” in a new report that advises officials to prepare for a world 2.8-3.3C hotter than preindustrial levels by 2100.Such a dramatic rise in temperatures – the prospect of which has left some leading climate scientists feelinghopeless– would be double the level of global heating that world leaders promised to aim for when they signed the Paris agreement in 2015. The ESABCC recommended officials stress-test even hotter scenarios.View image in fullscreenThe Portuguese army comes to the aid of residents affected by flooding.Photograph: Adri Salido/Anadolu/Getty ImagesWeather extremes in Europe in recent years have at times surprised climate scientists with theirstrengthand adaptation experts with theirlethalityas rising temperatures have warped the climate.Heavy rains supercharged by climate breakdown killed 134 people in Germany’s Ahr valley in 2021 and 229 people in the Valencia region of Spain in 2024. Across the continent, summer heat kills many tens of thousands of people each year, with studies attributing betweenhalfandtwo-thirdsof the death toll to the rise in temperatures caused by fossil fuel pollution. Last year’s wildfires, meanwhile,torchedmore of Europe than scientists have ever recorded.Last week,Portugal was urgedto draw up climate adaptation plans as the country was hit by an unprecedented series of storms that killed at least 16 people and caused an estimated €775m (£675m) of damage.EU urged not to roll back green agenda in effort to revive faltering economyRead moreVan Aalst said: “Twenty years ago, we’d have said those extremes are indeed going to be a problem, but primarily in poorer countries that cannot cope. What we’re now noticing is that Europe itself is vulnerable, especially for conditions it has not faced in the past.“It turns out our preparedness is not so great. And we have real work to do to upgrade our early warning systems.”The ESABCC report recommends that the EU mandate climate risk assessments, embed climate resilience into all policies and channel more money – including from private sources – into protective measures. It does not estimate the scale of investments needed to keep Europe safe.Van Aalst, who was an author of the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, said the most important message was to avoid a future in which the world heats to such an extreme degree.“The IPCC is clear this is a very problematic future with rapidly rising risks,” he said. “And for a number of risks, we’ll reach the limits of adaptation.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In some cases this was because fertility clinics failed to notify those affected.In an unusual situation, the move was unopposed, with no objections from the clinics, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority or the health secretary.Mrs Justice Morgan ruled that it would be lawful in 14 of the 15 cases for the material to continue to be stored and used. She said laws around human fertilisation and embryology were “unbending” but “the rigidity of the scheme is not rigidity for its own sake”.She continued: “It is surely consent that is important, not consent by an immutable date. I find it hard to conclude that parliament intended the possibility of parenthood should be removed by the ticking of a clock, not in the cliched phrase, the ticking of the biological clock, but by the ticking of the clock beyond midnight of the day when existing consent expires, whatever might be the circumstances.”Under the law, fertility clinics need written consent from clients every decade to continue storing biological material. The rules are intended to prevent cells being kept or used without people’s knowledge or permission.Owing to delays and issues accessing fertility treatment during the pandemic, the law allowed for a two-year extension, meaning people using the service on 1 July 2020 were granted extra time.Confusion caused by the extension meant some clinic users were not notified when they needed to renew consent, so it lapsed.In the one case where the judge ruled against, the circumstances were legally different. Morgan said the pair involved had not originally consented to an embryo being stored but one had been retained accidentally and they now wished to use it.She said: “There was never, on their case, a consent to renew. To be permitted to take advantage of the storage of the embryo which they say ‘contradicted’ their express wishes because the clinic acted on the wrong consent form to change their mind is not in my judgment renewing consent. It is a change of consent.”Explore more on these topicsFertility problemsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

But as a thrilling big air competition reached its denouement, an Italian with no anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee came down a 180‑feet ramp and drove a stake through the Briton’s heart.It all looked so promising when the 21-year-old from Aberdeen landed a stunning left double 1620, with four and a half rotations, to move into the medal positions after two of the three rounds. However, with just four jumps of the competition remaining, Flora Tabanelli, who tore her ACL in November, did the same trick as Muir but only better to score 94.25 points to steal the bronze medal.“It was a little bit bittersweet,” said Muir, who fell on her final jump and finished fourth. “I didn’t know what she did, but I knew it bumped my score by a decent amount and therefore I really did have to go for it. I gave it my all and I’m taking that with me.”Muir was right to hold her head high. After a competition that was delayed 75 minutes because of heavy snow and high winds, she played a blinder – only to find three women performing even better in a competition for the ages. Having also come close in Beijing, when she was just 17, she will hope it is third time lucky in 2030.The Canadian Megan Oldham deservedly took gold with a score of 180.75, with China’s Eileen Gu second with 179 and Tabanelli third on 178.25. Muir was 3.5pts back in fourth. It was her second time in eight days that the Scot had finished fourth, after she missed outin the women’s freeski slopestyleby 0.45pts.Earlier, Dave Ryding zigged and zagged for a fifth and final time at aWinter Olympicsbefore announcing his retirement. “I said I would ski race until my legs fall off and I think they pretty much have,” he said.Ryding’s 17th-placed finish in the men’s slalom in Bormio was not quite the swansong the 39-year-old had intended. But sometimes legacy matters as much as medals. He leaves the slopes as undoubtedly Britain’s greatest skier, after an unlikely journey that started by dodging sheep on a 50m dry-ski slope in Pendle, Lancashire.View image in fullscreenBritain’s Dave Ryding finished in 17th place in the men’s slalom.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I did it a totally different way and you probably say it was a one in a million shot,” he said. “But I proved that you can do it.”UK Sport may think differently, but not all Winter Olympic events are created equal. In some sports, having a technical advantage gives a competitor one hand on a medal before they even start; while in others, such as slalom skiing, the heritage and depth of competition matters. So when Ryding became the only Briton to win a World Cup skiing event, in Kitzbühel four years ago, it really cut through.“Five-time Olympian, World Cup winner – I really can’t ask for much more,” he said. “The icing on the cake would have been to pull something out today. I just didn’t quite have it to be honest. But I will never look back thinking: ‘Did I stop too soon?’ I gave it my all until the last gate.”As Ryding watched, Loïc Meillard became Switzerland’s first men’s Olympic slalom champion since 1948 after the first-run leader, Atle Lie McGrath, straddled a gate in his second run.And while skiing has a reputation in Britain for being a posh sport, Ryding is anything but. His dad was a market trader, his mother a hairdresser.When he started at the age of six, sometimes the sheep would run across him while he was training. On other occasions they would leave excrement that would cause him to slip.He had to struggle to make his fifth Olympics too. In 2022, UK Sport completely cut skiing’s funding; while it then relented and gave Ryding £80,000 a year, he decided it would be better spent helping his teammates, including Billy Major, who finished 16th, travel to events.While he is retiring, Ryding says he wants to bring through the next wave of British skiers and help them become World Cup winners.“I would put a bit of money on it saying that it is possible,” he said. “We have Youth Olympic and world junior championship medals so the next generation is amazing. I really hope UK Sport sees that and get behind them.”Ryding has already set his sights on a new target: lowering his parkrun personal best of 16min 54sec. “For sure, I don’t think I’ll get a dad bod too soon,” he said, smiling as he waved a final goodbye.Elsewhere, the British men’s and women’s curlers are in danger of missing out on the semi-finals after losing on Monday. Team GB’s men lost 7-6 against Norway, while the women were downed 6-10 by Switzerland.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Iranian foreign ministry regards it as a branch of chess, almost an art form.Indeed, for those in the US who claim Iran loves to play for time and spin a negotiation out, Araghchi’s book, The Power of Negotiation, provides some support.“The main principle of bargaining is practice: repetition, repetition, and repetition – combined with steadfastness and persistence. Insisting on positions and repeating demands is a necessity that must be done each time with different rhetoric and reasoning,” he writes.Born into a family of merchants – his grandfather was a carpet trader – he argues Iranian diplomacy reflects the country’s bazaars.“The Iranian negotiation style is generally known in the world as the ‘market style’, which means continuous and tireless bargaining. It requires a lot of time and energy, and he who gets tired and bored quickly will lose.”More theoretically, he argues in the book – written when out of office in 2014 – that when a negotiator enters the room, their true power rests on the level of national cohesion back home and the country’s military strength.If there is not at least a balance of power with your adversary, he argues it is best to decline talks until there is equilibrium, something Iran did after thebombing of its nuclear sites in June last year.Nevertheless, the Iranian tendency to say “Yes, but” can go far. Famously, Araghchi reduced his US counterpart Wendy Sherman to tears of frustration – something he regrets.Araghchi, who has already had six rounds of direct and indirect talks in two phases with Witkoff also discloses how vital it is to remain opaque.“The face of a skilled diplomat is inscrutable, and it is impossible to catch any emotion from it. The ability to control the expression of emotions on the face is not easy and requires continuous work and practice.”Providing your adversary with a graceful way out, he argues, is integral to diplomacy, describing this as providing “the Golden Bridge”, a term he has picked up from China (Araghchi spent four years as ambassador to Japan).This suggests that if Trump ends up accepting a version of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal from which he walked out in 2018, Araghchi will not be triumphalist. “Diplomacy is not a game that you must necessarily win, but a process where you must necessarily understand the other side,” he writes.Married twice, and with five children, Araghchi is a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war and maintains close relations with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC, unlike his predecessor, Zarif, whocriticised the elite forces’ power.“Araghchi is much more technocratic and careful in walking the tightrope necessary to survive,” said Ellie Geranmayeh from the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Zarif was more political and outspoken, and willing to test the boundaries of what was digestible for the regime.”Indeed, some thought Araghchi was put in the nuclear talks with Washington by Iranian conservatives to act as a check and balance on Zarif.Geranmayeh expects the US to make clear demands on diluting, or removing Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium, but such an irreversible step by Iran would require parallel irreversible steps by the US, such as releasing many of Iran’s large assets frozen abroad.The scope for a compromise on enrichment exists on the basis that the bombing of its nuclear sites makes it impossible to enrich for 3 to 5 years. But this would require the return of the UN nuclear inspectorate, the IAEA, to be able to visit the bombed sites, an issue that was probably at the centre of talks on Monday between Araghchi and Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general.Outside the nuclear aspects of the deal, Geranmayeh says: “In this Trumpian world, do not expect every agreement to be written down on paper. There could be a series of not verifiable understandings, including a non-aggression pact between Iran and the US and its allies.”Ali Ansari, professor of modern history at the University of St Andrews, said Iran may offer concessions “to keep the discussions going, but Trump is in no rush at present anyway”.Bringing in US oil companies – an economic concession that has been floated – would be a significant change in Iran’s anti-US revolutionary doctrine.Either way, Araghchi knows that whatever the outcome, he faces domestic criticism.Araghchi recalled once meeting with Zarif in the lift of Hassan Rouhani’s residence after the latter’s 2013 presidential election victory. At the time, Zarif had not yet accepted Rouhani’s offer to serve as his foreign minister. Araghchi asked him why. Zarif replied: ‘In the end, we’ll be found wanting, and we will be the victims.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaIran nuclear programmeUS foreign policyTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

As Hay notes, the chemical has long been studied as a painkiller for lung conditions ranging from pulmonary fibrosis to sarcoidosis, but its high toxicity precludes its therapeutic use.As a result researchersin countries including Russiahave been making chemicals witha similar structure, apparently in the hope of harnessing epibatidine’s analgesic properties without its toxicity.“Because its structure is known, it can be synthesised in the lab,” said Hay. “It’s a more complicated chemical structure, but competent chemists are not going to have a problem making it.” In fact epibatidine and its analogues can even be bought online for research purposes.Russia certainly has form for poisoning those who pose a threat. Among other cases, in 2006 the former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko died afterradioactive polonium-210 was slipped into his green tea, while in 2018 the former Russian agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliasurvived being poisoned by the nerve agent novichok– the substance later killed 44-year-old DawnSturgess.Indeed Russia isknown to have a poison factoryin Moscow and, as Hay points out, “very, very competent chemists”.The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, has suggested the use of epibatidine in the killing of Navalnyconveyed a message. “Russia saw Navalny as a threat. By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition,” she said.But while the poison might appear to be a macabre calling-card from the state, signalling an ability to dispose of its enemies in a nasty and painful way, some say the situation is rather less clear.“I think it would be very difficult to detect it, and that would probably be one of the reasons why it was used,” said Hay, adding the potency of the poison meant only a small quantity would be present in the body, making the chances of finding it remote.That the toxin has been identified is, Hay suggests, down to state of the art instruments. It also – crucially – required samples from Navalny’s body. Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, has previously stated such samples were smuggled out of Russia.But Dr Brett Edwards, an expert in biological and chemical weapons at the University of Bath, said that if the goal was to avoid detection, or create a more deniable situation, there were many other poisons – or other methods – that could have been used.That, he said, meant it was a deliberate choice to deploy the unusual toxin – as was the case for the novichok poisonings.“[Navalny] was in a high-security prison. So, first of all, nothing gets in there unless they wanted [it] to get in there, particularly for a political prisoner, for obvious reasons,” he said. “If they wanted to do it quietly, they wouldn’t have used a toxin.”Edwards noted the Russian state did delay the release of Navalny’s body – possibly to make it harder for others to acquire and analyse samples. But, he added, the use of poisons hasa long traditionas a tool of Russian statecraft – potentially explaining why it was the chosen method for killing Navalny.To Dr Luca Trenta, an associate professor of international relations at Swansea University, the case did not appear to involve overt signalling, unlike the attack on Litvinenko or the Skripals, where the message was one of reach and capability.“It was not like with the Skripals or with Litvinenko in which it was clearly impossible to hide,” he said. “This one, if it had not been for a fairly long effort at getting some samples and some testing out, it might not have been discovered.”Instead Trenta said Russia might have been testing the use of epibatidine, showcasing such capabilities if the exotic toxin was discovered, or simply using a particularly hideous weapon in revenge.“If there is a signal to be sent here [it] is Russia’s ability to use these weapons, to produce these weapons. And in a sense, its disregard for international norms and international law,” he said. “But again, it’s a tricky case when it comes to signalling, because if it was a signalling matter perhaps it would have been more overt.”Edwards noted that while the use of epibatidine raised the question of what other capabilities Russia might have, the bottom line remained the same. “It’s intriguing, but in essence, it’s just murder. It’s just standard political murder. They’ve always done it. They’ll keep doing it,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAlexei NavalnyPoisonRussiaVladimir PutinEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

As for the star … well, it’s the part she was born to play.Isabelle Huppertis Countess Elizabeth Báthory, 16th-century Hungarian noblewoman and serial killer, legendary for having the blood of hundreds of young girls on her hands and indeed her body, in an attempt to attain eternal youth. The “blood countess” has been variously played in the past by Ingrid Pitt, Delphine Seyrig, Paloma Picasso, Julie Delpy and many more, but surely none were as qualified as Huppert who importantly does not modify her habitual hauteur one iota for the role.Her natural aristocratic mien and cool hint of elegant contempt were never so well matched with a part. She gives us the classic Huppert opaque gaze – part dreamy, part coldly assessing – and the politely bemused half-smile of concealed distaste, merging into a pout, at the absurdity or ill manners of someone to whom she cannot avoid being introduced. Unlike the other mere mortals in this film, Huppert’s face is lit like that of a Golden Age Hollywood star, giving her impeccable maquillage a ghostly sheen of profane sainthood.Her Countess Báthory is a vampire who has returned to present-day Vienna, the historic seat of the Austro-Hungarian empire, seen initially gliding through its sewers as if on a royal barge, far more coolly than Harry Lime in The Third Man, though like Lime she is to get her moment on Vienna’s Riesenrad ferris wheel. With her vampire maidservant Hermine (Birgit Minichmayr), she sets out to reacquaint herself with relatives, including her nephew Rudi (Thomas Schubert), a timid milquetoast member of the undead Báthory clan, attended by his therapist Theobald (Lars Eidinger). Rudi is a devotee of the fine arts who sees in a painting what he believes to be evidence of a much-rumoured poetic text of such melancholy that a vampire could be cured of immortality by shedding tears over it. Countess Báthory naturally has no interest in that and sets out to slake her thirst; the city is soon convulsed with fear at news of a serial killer on the loose.The keynote of the film is (inevitably) surreal black humour in a succession of bizarre episodes, often engagingly bizarre, sometimes heavy-handed, although it is notable that the script is partly credited toAustria’s Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelinekwho is not known for humour of any sort. (Audiences may remember her novel The Piano Teacherchillingly filmed by Michael Hanekewith Huppert in the very not funny lead role.)What parts of this were written by Jelinek? I would guess at the grisly scenes in the ladies’ lavatory in which abürgerlicheViennese woman is intimately approached by the countess with predictable results. And how about that mysterious text and its redemptive tears? Is that going to lead us anywhere? Well, not really; storytelling is not exactly the point. At one moment, the countess makes a triumphal entrance to the music of the Radetzky March, often described as the right-wing Marseillaise. In some ways, this Blood Countess can be read as a satire of the Austrian ruling class and its eternal snobbery and vanity.I wonder if there is scope for a non-mythic, tongue-out-of-cheek portrayal of Countess Báthory, a film that commits fully to fear or eroticism and in which humour is not always being sneakily deployed as a kind of alibi in case we find it all ridiculous. Or even a Wicked-like revisionism? A study of how the countess’s reputation has been trashed by misogynists and she was actually really nice? Maybe Ariana Grande would be interested.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsIsabelle HuppertComedy filmsDrama filmsAustriaComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

There is a library, a cafeteria, classrooms, and a noticeboard celebrating the star of the week. But it is different in one crucial respect: in 25 years, thisLondonalternative provision has not excluded a single pupil.AsLabour pushesto bring more children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) into mainstream schools and keep them there, questions are emerging about what this inclusion should look like in practice. Staff atTCES Nurture primaryin Newham, east London, believe their model offers some answers.View image in fullscreen‘We take children that society has given up on,’ says Thomas Keaney, the TCES founder and chief executive.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian“We take children that society has given up on,” says Thomas Keaney, the founder and chief executive of TCES Group, which runs five schools in London as well as outreach, training and therapy services. “Many have been out of school for up to two years and have, on average, three permanent exclusions.”At TCES, pupils are taught in small classes, with therapy embedded into daily teaching rather than delivered separately. Staff say this allows children to rebuild confidence and trust after years of struggle in mainstream settings.The school operates around three core principles: never exclude; ensure every child has a trusted adult by design; and work with families as partners. Demand has been so high that TCES is now building a second primary school in north London.“When you look at who is being excluded, it’s always the same children,” Keaney says. “Disabled pupils, Black and minority ethnic children, Gypsy and Traveller children and those living in poverty. This is a social justice issue.”View image in fullscreenStaff at TCES are clear that the cost of failing to intervene early is ultimately far higher.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianWhile Keaney welcomes Labour’s emphasis on inclusion, he warns that the government’s £200m Send teacher training programme will fall short without deeper reform. He argues that training alone risks producing a “symbolic” version of inclusion that leaves children’s needs unmet.View image in fullscreen‘Here, therapeutic principles are built into how teachers deliver lessons,’ says Ricardo Hylton, the headteacher at TCES Nurture primary.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianRicardo Hylton, the headteacher at TCES Nurture primary, says the difference lies in how support is delivered. “In previous schools, a therapist would take pupils out for one-to-one sessions. Here, therapeutic principles are built into how teachers deliver lessons. We use daily intervention guidelines that shape how staff work with children.”Simply placing another adult alongside a pupil makes little difference if teachers do not understand how a child processes language, sensory input or classroom environments, he adds.In a year 3 classroom, two pupils who are safeguarding champions describe the contrast with their previous schools. “They help with speech and special needs here,” says Frankie. Ian puts it more bluntly: “They don’t just kick them out.”Asked what else they like about the school, pupils talk about football, reading, celebration assemblies and the “dojo shop”, where points earned for effort and good behaviour can be saved or spent on small rewards. Keaney says these systems are deliberate. Giving responsibility and status to children who have often been punished elsewhere, he argues, can be a powerful way to re-engage them.View image in fullscreenPupils are taught in small classes, with therapy embedded into daily teaching rather than delivered separately.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe impact is felt at home, too. Two mothers of pupils at the school, Bobbie and Jade, describe a dramatic reduction in stress.“The absence of constant calls from this school is huge,” Bobbie says. “At our previous school I would see the number and panic. I was called in daily, climbing fences to get him down. Here, I rarely get calls. We are not living on edge.”Jade recalls her son attending a previous school for just one hour a day, in a single room with multiple staff and little social contact. “All areas of my son are understood in this school,” she says. “And if they’re not, they work with me.”View image in fullscreenBobbie and Jade, mothers of pupils at the school, both describe a dramatic reduction in stress since their sons started here.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianAt a time when many schools are fundraising simply to plug gaps in basic provision, approaches like this can be dismissed as too costly or unrealistic. But Keaney rejects that outright.“This isn’t a financial issue,” he says. “But it does require investment in knowing how to do this properly.” What is needed, he argues, is a cultural shift after decades in which schools have been shaped to exclude children.Instead of exclusion, Keaney advocates a “pause” before removal, exhausting low-cost interventions first, giving disengaged pupils responsibility rather than punishment, and combining firm boundaries with therapeutic understanding. He says schools need hands-on support and regularly staffed helplines to help change practice.View image in fullscreenAt TCES Nurture Primary, no child has been excluded in 25 years.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianHe is wary of Labour’s push to expand Send provision inside mainstream schools. Done badly, it risks becoming “exclusion by another route”, he warns.“Children can’t be parked at the back of the school, out of sight and out of mind.” He says inclusion must be whole-school, not segregation under a different name.Staff at TCES are clear that the cost of failing to intervene early is ultimately far higher, pushing children towards long-term exclusion and, for some, the school-to-prison pipeline.Keaney ends with a recent case shared with visiting officials: a non-speaking autistic child who arrived at the school violent and overwhelmed, leaving his mother covered in bruises. Soon after starting at TCES, she told the room: “I have not had a meltdown in six weeks. He used to have six a day.”As the meeting ended, her boy walked in, took her hand and said: “Home, Mum, home.” He now speaks in three-word sentences. For Keaney, it was the clearest illustration of what inclusion looks like when done properly.Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsPrimary schoolsSchoolsChildrenEducation policyLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are film-makers who have given us challenging and interesting material in the past; now they pivot to a solemn, narcissistic tale, couched in self-forgiving, self-adoring rhetoric, all about upper-middle-class artistic folk in the US, yearning for wellness and recovery in their lovely Cape Cod home. It’s a movie which invites its audience to believe in the alleged talent and importance of its artistic characters, and also extend submissive empathy to their inter-generational psychic wounds.Adams plays Laura, the grownup daughter of a supposedly brilliant dance company director, now dead and remembered in epiphanic childhood memory-glimpses, a genius who had close-cropped grey hair, a black polo neck and functioning alcoholism. Laura inherited his dance passion and his boozing, and now runs his world-renowned company with an uncertain hand; she has just returned from rehab after drunk-driving and crashing while her young son Felix (Redding Munsell) was in the car. Thank heavens they weren’t hurt! You can spend the entire film expecting a flashback to this dramatic event which might show Laura in a bad light – or an interesting one. But no.Shame, healing and personal growth in a lovely setting are the order of the day. Her artist husband Martin (Murray Bartlett) – we are supposed to believe his paintings are good – is angry yet concerned, and their teen daughter Josie (Chloe East) (also a super-talented dancer of course) is angry and hurt. Wealthy friend George (Rainn Wilson), a business sponsor of the company, supplies the angry-yet-concerned combo, while Laura’s witty gay assistant Peter (Dan Levy) is angry-and-concerned at the way she has neglected the company while on her secret rehab stint. Martin had claimed her absence was a research trip among the Indigenous dancers of Bali, a touch that in a less humourless film might generate some incidental entertainment.The very first sight we have of Adams’s face is a closeup of her expression of dignified suffering and self-knowledge as she participates in an entirely preposterous drumming-therapy session. It’s basically the default facial expression for the entire film: she will laugh or (at one stage) cry with mortification – having yet again neglected Felix’s wellbeing, allowing him to be stung by jellyfish, and having to be helped out by a dishy recovering addict who now flies kites on the beach. But basically it’s that same deadly serious and solemn expression, which is so far from the brilliant and lively performances that Adams is known for. And to top it all off, they have money worries (not as other mortals know them), and might have to – gasp! – sell the lovely Cape Cod house.These complacent bores pursue their issues to an uninteresting quasi-catharsis – and Laura and Josie actually do some impromptu modern dance together on the beach. It’s an uncomfortable spectacle.At the Sea screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsAmy AdamsBerlin film festivalBerlin film festival 2026FestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was my first film as director and I thought my career was over. It was during this downtime that I wrote A Knight’s Tale. I loved the idea that jousting tournaments were medieval sports, but I had never figured out what to do with it. I thought about the ideas underpinning it: a peasant who wants to be a noble was like a screenwriter wanting to be a director. It’s a guy trying to be something he has no right to be.The studio had a shortlist of actors for William/Sir Ulrich, at the top of which wasPaul Walker. I met him but he seemed too contemporary, like a guy who should be driving race cars – which he did so well in The Fast and the Furious. I just thought: “You’re not going to pull this off.” Heath Ledger was a rising star at the time. I met him at a restaurant in LAX airport and he had this long leather case with him. “What’s in the case?” I asked. He said: “It’s my didgeridoo.” “Can you play it?” I asked. He said: “Of course I can.” And he started blowing on it like a white Australian Miles Davis. Everyone was looking. I fell in love with him in that moment and offered him the part.The only thing more embarrassing than walking down the street naked is doing it with a sock on your penisI wrote the part of Chaucer forPaul Bettany, although Sony wanted Hugh Grant. I’ve got nothing against Hugh but I thought the tone would be skewed if it was him and three other guys. The movie has since been written about by Chaucer scholars – they love it.We jousted for real with re-enactors from a Las Vegas jousting show. But we made the lances of balsa wood so they wouldn’t kill anybody. The art department made compartments in them and put uncooked spaghetti in: when the lances broke, they exploded and the pasta went up in the air looking like splinters. We put the Nike logo on Sir Ulrich’s armour as a joke. Years later, someone at Nike told me how much they loved it. I thought: “We could’ve got so many free sneakers!”View image in fullscreen‘He got a tattoo mid-shoot’ … Heath Ledger and Brian Helgeland on location.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyHeath got pretty bashed up. He’d proudly lift his shirt and there’d be huge abrasions. After the movie came out, we were demonstrating how to joust to his agent. He had a broom and I had a mic stand: he hit me in the mouth by accident and knocked my tooth out.It got reviewed badly. Someone criticised the score – not the modern songs but the score itself, because it has electric guitar. I said: “Should it have violins and french horns? Because they didn’t exist in 1370 either.”Heath said A Knight’s Tale was like a photo album of how much fun he had making it. It’s about fighting the power – and that speaks to today very well.Paul Bettany, played ChaucerI auditioned and the studio said: “We don’t get him.” Brian flew me out for another audition and they still didn’t get it. Finally he said: “If you don’t cast him, I’m not making the movie.” And because they had Heath attached, who was the hottest thing going after10 Things I Hate About You, they went: “All right, we’ll let Brian have Paul in this fucking movie.”So Brian started my Hollywood career. He was like a shining knight. I knew exactly what it was like to be an unrecognised artist. I used to have a philosophy for whenever I was nervous before an audition. I’d think: “All you have to do is fake confidence for 15 minutes.” That was the basis of Chaucer for me: fake it till you make it.There are lots of jokes in Chaucer’s first speech but we were in Prague and the extras didn’t speak English, so they just stared at me. We drew up these massive cards that said “Applaud” or “Laugh” in Czech. I came away thinking I’d really killed it when they laughed. I was amazed at my own shallowness.View image in fullscreen‘Hey, naked guy!’ … Ledger and Bettany as William and Chaucer.Photograph: Egon Endrenyi/API was very nervous about thenaked scenes. Before we shot, the costume team knocked on my trailer with a sock on a hanger. I asked: “What’s this for?” They said: “To put on your junk in case you’re embarrassed.” I said: “The only thing more embarrassing than walking down the street naked is doing it with a sock on your penis.” Mercifully, it was a warm day. After all the roles I’ve played, which includes Vision for Marvel, I mostly get “Hey, naked guy!” shouted at me in the street.Heath got a tattoo mid-shoot. It was a tiny circle with a circle around it and then a bigger circle around that, like a target. He said: “That’s me in the middle. That circle is the Earth, and the other circle is the universe.” I said: “You’ve put yourself right in the middle? I’ve never been that confident!” But he was that confident in the most joyful, winning way.So much has been said about Heath and darkness, but the moment you saw him, he just radiated light, happiness and joy. He was a ball of creativity and charisma, so very alive that even today it’s difficult to imagine him dead. I often find myself wondering what beautiful things he would have made.A Knight’s Tale is a film about a boy from nowhere who changes his stars and I love that. It’s full of positive messaging.

It’s almost a metaphor for diplomatic relations between the US and the UKMon 16 Feb 2026 11.53 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 13.59 ESTShareWhen Liz Trusstweeted a photo of herselfstanding next to Donald Trump, she captioned it “right about everything”. All that effort, all that security clearance and long-haul travel and whatnot, to reach the pinnacle of proximity to your spiritual leader, and that’s the best she could come up with? It was bafflingly lame. And yet the least confusing thing about this scene were the words.What exactly is going on in this photo? Truss clearly knows where she is, because she’s grinning with a kind of victorious serenity, as if she’s finally achieved the plaudit she knew all along was hers. At the same time – not wishing to be unsisterly – she doesn’t appear to have brushed her hair, so it doesn’t feel like this photo opportunity was in anyone’s diary. It looks like a selfie you’d catch when you run into your favourite contestant from The Traitors on your way through an airport. No time to worry about your grooming; it’s the chance of a lifetime, every second counts.Trump, meanwhile, looks absolutely mystified. He seems to somehow know he’s meant to smile, but is forcing it so hard it’s rippling down his neck without ever reaching his eyes. His thumb is at half-mast, more like a twitch, a muscle memory, than a signal of enthusiasm. It’s anyone’s guess whether he knows who she is, or why they’re together. Nothing whatsoever about this picture says “leaders on the world stage”, which is fine, because Truss isn’t one. But if she’s not there in a political capacity, how did she finagle the access? Did she just have to drop 50 grand on a plate at a fundraising breakfast?She’s very much off the grownups table – somewhere between a bad fairy godmother and a shambling hecklerYou could stare at this image for ever without figuring out who knows what about how they came to be here and why, but one thing you can pick up immediately: the special relationship, wherein the US apparently loved the UK more than any other European nation, and we reciprocated by loving the US more than we had any business doing, and we talked about it all the time and they talked about it a lot less …thatspecial relationship? It’s over. It would have been better if we’d ended things on grounds of principle, rather than waiting for America to humiliate us bystepping out with our nemesis, but lickspittle dogs don’t always get to choose how relationships end, not even special ones.To recap on Truss’s place in British politics: she was prime minister for only 49 days, which on its own would tell a story of total disaster andignominy, even without all the havoc she wreaked on the economy and people’s mortgages. So much more than a failed political and economic experiment, she’s a figure of ridicule, lampooned for her shorter-than-a-lettuce shelf life by even the rightwing print media that enabled her lamentable rise.And all that is before she started talking. When she launched herYouTube show in December, the chaos-in-a-cupboard vibe slightly contradicted the immense simplicity of her opinions. London is falling, the UK is falling, the west is falling, all because of the deep state and the elites. Hers is a fervent and paranoid tale of perpetual crisis. It’s quite a familiar “alt-right” playbook, which itself borrows its rhythms from the bubbly hysteria of timeless totalitarianism. And in terms of UK politics, it situates her as very much off the grownups’ table – somewhere between a bad fairy godmother and a shambling heckler. Her long game, we can leave for another day; Donald Trump standing next to her, whether he knows who she is or not, is very much today’s question. What does it say? We’re dumped, guys. Time to face up to it and find a new special relationship.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLiz TrussOpinionDonald TrumpConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

Not the left or the right – and not the centre any more. That’s why there’s been a nosedive in the pollsMon 16 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 05.16 ESTShareAfter a tumultuous few weeks, we are once again in “reset” territory. Keir Starmer has bought some more time, there is amodest bounce in his polling, and he has had the well-timed fortune of the Munich security conference. His call there for the“remaking” of western alliancesand taking the initiative on European defence cooperation has fumigated the air a little of the sense of imminent demise that has been swirling around him. But it will probably be a temporary hiatus. He is in a hole that is too deep to climb out of. The prime minister’s persistent unpopularity is best understood as the result of abundance: there is simply, in Starmer, something for everyone to deplore.In policy, he has taken stances that have established him in the minds of many people as devoid of principle and compassion. On Gaza, Starmer got it wrong from the start. From hisearly assertionthat Israel had the right to cut off water and power, torefusing calls for a ceasefireand then cracking down on protest (a move nowjudged as unlawfulby the high court), the prime minister positioned himself against a hugedomestic swell of distress. Add to that the cuts to disability benefits that made him appear callous after so many years of austerity, and what you have – whatever U-turns or watering down followed – is an impression of a politician whose instincts are those of a state apparatchik; someone whose default is enforcing pre-existing conventional wisdoms in foreign policy and economics, no matter how damaging or unpopular they are.Feeding into this is his feverish immigration rhetoric and policy. The “island of strangers” speech; the hectic posting and projection of imagery and footage ofcrackdown,arrestsanddeportations; the launch of measure after measure making life harder for those already working and living in the country legally; and for refugees, extending the qualifying timefor settlementandending family reunification. More positions that simply build on the immigration hysteria of the late Tory years and communicate that under Starmer, Labour is a continuity consensus party.And then there is Starmer himself. Personality alone does not make a politician, and God knows we have suffered enough from big personalities such as Boris Johnson – but you needsomething. Not necessarily fireworks and charm, but at the minimum just a sense of tangibility. Starmer is impalpable; not in the sense that he isn’t there, but that he is hiding.He doesn’t dream, he says, nor does he have phobias, nor favourite novels. He communicates in only the most generic terms, in staccato sentences using repetitive themes – “change” or his working-class roots – connected by meaningless “let me be clears” and “make no mistakes”.10:37Is Starmer out of the woods after Labour showdown? - The LatestThis manner summons all sorts of characters that overpopulate our corporatised lives – the middle manager, the jobsworth, the emissary from whatever head office. He has a way of somehow always communicating that sorry, he’s just doing his job – while holding the most powerful office in the country. Again, a state representative rather than a leader with volition and conviction.Who is this person’s constituency? Not the left, to which he has made clear in policy and in purges that this is not itsLabourparty. Not the right, which will never be at home in Labour, no matter how many people it deports or how much capital it courts. And not the centre any more, for which Starmer’s incompetence and lurching from one debacle to the next is becoming increasingly hard to rationalise.This is why there has been a nosedive in the polls, one that for past prime ministers would have been cushioned by whichever constituency they explicitly served: Brexiters, anti-immigration ultras, establishment free-marketeers, the working class. Who is out there banging the tables for “growth” and genocide?And then there is the obvious: two lords appointed to senior roles despiteassociations with sex offenders, and the disruption caused by the changing of personnel in the wake of related staff departures. The lack of judgment in these appointments is once more an indictment of Starmer’s tendency to defer to establishment names, networks and advisers who staff the senior ranks of a government that is a mash-up of zombie New Labour and austerity management inertia. If it’s broke, don’t fix it.The slow implosion of Keir Starmer’s government is the ultimate repudiation of ‘Labour minimalism’ | Andy BeckettRead moreBut Starmer’s problem is even bigger than that. Disliking him has become something wider: an expression of, once again, being thwarted and let down by politicians. He is feeling the impact of the country’s recent history of government instability, corruption and short premierships. The time he had to prove himself was always short, so violated was the country by the Brexit and pandemic years. Starmer was supposed to wipe the slate clean, not further sully it with his own record.More serious still is his failure in not having even the faintest ability to understand that the entire political establishment was on probation – and that he needed to break with the past in the most dramatic and surefooted ways in both policy and affect. The public is on high alert for cliquishness and chaos. The feelings of thosewho hate Starmerare sharpened by the fact that even he – finally a Labour leader who campaigned on being a decent, hardworking and upright person – could not deliver. There is no stronger feeling than one inspired by those you expected better from.All this doesn’t fit neatly with macro-concerns about paving the way for Reform with a sooner rather than later election, or the risks of plunging the country into another phase of economic and political instability by dumping yet another prime minister. But that doesn’t refute in any way the reasons for Starmer’s unpopularity. In a way, the prime minister is a manifestation of the dead end British politics finds itself in – either far-right populism, or Starmer’s all-at-once volatile, unintelligible and remote regime.

That’s just a new Maga trapMon 16 Feb 2026 05.41 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 11.30 ESTShareThe good news from the Munich Security Conference is that there was no dramatic deterioration in the transatlantic relationship. After the shock of last year’s event, whenJD Vance stunned the audience with a frontal US attackon Europe’s liberal democracies, the seemingly moreconciliatory tone struck by Marco Rubiowas greeted by many present, including Wolfgang Ischinger, a veteran German diplomat and the conference chair, as “reassuring”. Indeed, the US secretary of state got a standing ovation in the room – a gesture perhaps more of relief than of adulation. But is the Trump administration’s message to Europe really any different now from that contained in Vance’s assault 12 months ago? What traps are being laid and what lessons should Europeans draw?A year ago, Vance accused Europe of succumbing to the alleged tyranny and censorship of woke liberals and losing sight of the cultural bonds that link the two shores of the Atlantic. His attack baffled European leaders, who, while often prone to navel-gazing about their internal struggles, do not consider restrictions on free speech a primary concern. The US vice-president shocked Munich by insisting that Europe’s biggest threat was the woke “threat from within”, even as he endorsed far-right nationalists includingGermany’s AfD. The insult was so deep that this year the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, used his opening address to issue a blunt warning about American unilateralist values,declaring that“the culture war of the Maga movement is not ours”.With Europeans desperate for reassurance, they were eager for any signs of transatlantic solidarity in Rubio’s speech. The secretary of state offered warm words, celebrating the shared cultural heritage, history and specifically the Christianity of the west. He claimed that the US, a “child of Europe”, was not interested in managing western decline but instead determined to spearhead a western civilisational renaissance.But beneath the surface, Rubio’s speech this year and Vance’s in 2025 were two sides of the same coin. Vance’s was crude and outrageous, even silly. At a time when there is democratic backsliding in most regions of the world, to claim that Europe’s biggest problem is a lack of free speech is simply ridiculous.Rubio’s speech was more subtle and coherent, but he in essence sang from the same hymn sheet: the message from Washington remains that Europe and the US should be defined by ethno-political values of culture, tradition and religion. The fact that such history has also bred nationalism, racism, fascism and colonialism is apparently nothing to be ashamed of.In Europe, we may have thought that we had turned the page, defining the continent in opposition to its past – embracing civic and Enlightenment values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law, multilateralism, inclusion and integration, and rejecting the scourge of nationalism. But for the standard bearers of the Maga movement, it is nationalism that is to be celebrated. The rules-based order is not just dead, as European leaders themselves recognise; it is, in Rubio’s characterisation, outright “foolish”.But if western civilisation is to be nurtured while rules are not, the vision Rubio outlined is fundamentally one of empire. In this imagining, the Americas and Europe are bound by ancestry and religion; “connected spiritually”, as Rubio put it. Proud nationalist forces on both sides of the Atlantic must jointly battle globalism, cancel culture and the “civilisational erasure” that mass migration supposedly threatens.But the “western century” will be marked by raw power, exercised first and foremost within the empire itself by the strong – the US – against the weak: small and medium-sized European countries, Canada and South American states. Within the empire, there can and should be institutions, starting withNato. But the US intention is crystal clear: you pay up – which is fair – but we still call the shots, which is not. There will be other empires in the world, including Russia and China, and the American empire will compete with them. Yet it is also ready to cooperate, perhaps even collude, especially if the price for collusion is to be paid by its colonial subjects.Rubio’s message was more sophisticated and strategic than Vance’s. But it was just as dangerous, if not more so, precisely because it lowered the transatlantic temperature and may have lulled Europe into a false sense of calm. As Benjamin Haddad, France’s Europe minister, said in Munich, the European temptation may be to press the snooze button once again.There are good reasons to believe this will not happen. Merz, along with Emmanuel Macron, Keir Starmer, Pedro Sánchez and the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, all spoke of the need for European independence, for giving substance to the EU treaty’sarticle 42.7, a pledge of mutual assistancein the event of attack and for a Europeanised Nato. As von der Leyen put it, the lines that have been crossed cannot be uncrossed. Russia’s war on Ukraine – which approaches its fourth anniversary – added a sense of urgency. So did the sober reminder from the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, that the US threat to Greenland has not gone away.While European resolve and collective action will most likely continue, the bulk of the energy will be devoted to working within existing transatlantic frameworks, especially Nato. This should indeed be a key strand of work. The fact that theUK and Italy are each taking over Nato commandsfrom the US signals an important step toward establishing aEuropean “pillar”within the defence alliance. The US will remain critical, providing command and control,specialised capabilitiesand, above all, the nuclear umbrella. Diplomats believe that at the end of this journey Nato will look very different, with the US representing an estimated fifth or less of its military capacity, down from just under half today.However, if the US is driven by an imperial vision in which its strategic interests diverge from Europe’s – if Washington no longer considers Vladimir Putin’s Russia a national security threat – should Europeans pin their security hopes exclusively on a Europeanised Nato?A European pillar within Nato is the most effective route to a secure Europe as the US scales back responsibility for the continent’s defence. It is certainly far more achievable than turning the EU into a military alliance or even defending Europe through formalised coalitions of the willing and able.But in practice, it cannot guarantee European security if the US pursues its current imperial trajectory. If Europeans were comforted by a false sense of reassurance as they walked away from the packed Bayerischer Hof hotel in Munich, they risk walking straight into the trap that Maga America has laid for them.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What is happening and why?The alarm comes from changes in the way taxpayers’ money is invested by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), which recentlypublished its planon how to disburse £38.6bn of public research and development funding over the next four years. Change is always unsettling, and as the UKRI’s chief executive, Ian Chapman, says, there will always be those wholose out when change happens. Difficult choices must be made.As an example, the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), one of UKRI’s subsidiary councils, announced thecancellation of several projectsit had been asked to take forward by the UKRI infrastructure fund. These include a nuclear physics collaboration with the US, a powerful microscopy facility at Daresbury and a major UK-led project at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as Cern.My own research in particle physics is funded via the STFC. So is research into astronomy and nuclear physics, as well as large UK multidisciplinary facilities. STFC also takes care of international subscriptions, ranging from our membership of Cern to telescopes, light sources and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. Those international projects carry important considerations around “science diplomacy”, or UK soft power, as well as being crucial to our national research capacity. A recent success in this area wasthe appointment of Mark Thomson, the first British director general of Cern since the 1990s, after a sustained campaign from this government and its predecessor. Given the difficulties in relations with our European partners post-Brexit, this was a very positive development.It is now marred by the fact thata letter announcing cutsto UK-Cern collaborations arrived as Thomson takes over – most definitely not good science diplomacy.Overall, Michele Dougherty, executive chair of the STFC, has said that UK investment in particle physics, astronomy and nuclear physicswill fall by 30%. This will be devastating to a tightly managed portfolio of projects that are essential to the success, probably even the survival, of several excellent physics departments around the country, as well as the careers of a generation of researchers. These areas are major attractors of students and international researchers into UK science and technology, and many studies have shown that they make huge contributions to the economy, often in unpredictable ways.It is through this portfolio that we reap the scientific and economic benefits of our membership ofCernand the large international astrophysics projects. Without proper investment in the UK, we can’t make best use of the membership fees we pay. In effect, we will be helping pay for these large-scale experiments around the world, but won’t fund enough UK scientists to analyse the data they produce.The justification for these changes stems from a positive recognition that investing in research drives economic growth. To this end, UKRI has defined “buckets”, or new categories of research, to better apportion funding. The House of Commons science, innovation and technology select committee in a recent session asked for a more inspiring name than “buckets”, but for now it stands.Bucket one is labelled “Curiosity-driven research”. Bucket two is “Strategic government and societal priorities” and bucket three is “Supporting innovative companies”. Bucket four, “Enabling and strengthening UK R&D”, is for investments that make substantial contributions across the other three, such as skills training and multidisciplinary facilities.This is at least a potentially reasonable way of allocating resources, and Chapman says that the changes are mainly about transparency and measuring outcomes,writing: “UKRI has always funded these three areas but has not been as clear as it needs to be on what goes where and what outcomes are expected.” But the devil is in the detail. What is the journey from a “curiosity-led” discovery through to something that addresses a societal priority and then maybe gets commercialised by an innovative company? And is the balance of resource – who gets what – shifting? Chapmantold the select committeethat last question couldn’t be answered, because the buckets are new.He seeks to reassure, saying that, despite pauses to several funding programmes, curiosity-led research (bucket one) will be protected, and researchers will be able to bid for support from the other buckets, too. Many in the research community are worried about this, but there at least some who are confident that the opportunities created will be significant. However, these reassurances are hard to square with the cuts at the STFC, much of which fall squarely on the category of curiosity-driven research.Difficult choices have to be made, but they have to be good choices or we risk profound long-term damage to our research ecosystem. And making a good choice requires an attention to detail that seems to have been lacking from UKRI so far. In answer to questions at his lecture to the Campaign for Science and Engineering on Tuesday, Chapman said that, regarding STFC cuts, “no decision has been made”, and that the impact would be evaluated before things were set in stone. This is a positive sign. There is still time to avoid a disaster, but it is running out.Jon Butterworth is professor of physics at University College London, and a member of the ATLAS Collaboration at CernExplore more on these topicsScienceOpinionCernPhysicsParticle physicscommentShareReuse this content"

That is the conclusion of a new compendiousstudyof current armed conflicts around the world, citing the killing of civilians and other atrocities in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and elsewhere. “While the threat to IHL is not yet existential,” it warns, “it is at a critical breaking point.”There is no doubt that the disregard for civilian life in these conflicts has been horrendous. In Gaza andSudan, it has risen to the level of genocide. But do these represent serious violations of the law or its demise?Let’s consider an analogy: when an ordinary murder is committed on a city street, is that a serious crime or a license to kill? If the authorities investigate, arrest and prosecute the suspect, we consider the murder an unfortunate offense but don’t question the status of the law against it. But if the authorities were to ignore the killing, suggesting that they are just as happy to be rid of the victim, it would be another matter entirely.By the same token, the key to understanding whether the lethal conflicts of recent years spell the dissolution of IHL is to examine the reaction. The response has been mixed, weaker than it should be, but still considerable. That leads me to believe it premature to pronounce IHL dead.Take Gaza. There is no denying that the government of Benjamin Netanyahu has ripped up the Geneva conventions and their protocols – the main codification of IHL. The Israeli militaryhasindiscriminately bombed neighborhoods, attacked military targets when it knew the civilian toll would be disproportionate, deliberately fired on civilians, and deprived civilians of food and other necessities.Yet the international response has hardly been a shrug. The UN security council isstymiedby theveto– in this case Washington’s – but repeated condemnations have been issued by the UNgeneral assemblyand the UNhuman rights council, where there is no veto. The monitoring mechanisms established by the council have issued regularreportsand even have found Israel to have committedgenocidein Gaza. The international court of justice is hearing agenocidecase against Israel brought by South Africa – now joined byothers– and has demanded Israelendits illegal occupation. The international criminal court (ICC) haschargedNetanyahu and his former defense chief, Yoav Gallant, with war crimes and crimes against humanity for starving and depriving civilians.Of course some responses have been far weaker. The US government in particular has continued to funnelarmsandbillionsof dollars to the Israeli military. But given the extensive global outrage at Israel’s slaughter, Washington looks more like an accomplice to atrocities than a reason to declare the death of the law protecting civilians.The response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine tells a similar story. Russia’svetohas blocked security council action, but thegeneral assemblyandhuman rights councilhave issued condemnations. The council set up monitoring and reporting mechanisms for Russia’s war crimes inUkraineand repression inat home. The ICC has charged the Russian president, VladimirPutin, and another official with kidnapping Ukrainian children, andfourRussian commanders with attacking civilian electrical infrastructure in Ukraine. Many governments have imposedsanctionson Russia, althoughChinaand others continue to buy its oil, essentially financing the atrocities. The global reaction can hardly be said to accept Putin’s illegal conduct.The international reaction has been weaker but still considerable to today’s two most dire situations in Africa – the civil war in Sudan and Rwanda’s invasion of eastern DR Congo. On Sudan, the security council hascondemnedthe atrocities, although the general assembly hasnotacted. The human rights council has alsocondemnedthe severe abuses andestablisheda monitoring and reporting mechanism which hasspokenout, as have other UNexperts. The ICC prosecutors havebriefedthe security council on their investigation of recent atrocities in Sudan but have yet to publicly issue charges.The United Arab Emirates is the principalsourceof arms for the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as it commits genocide, slaughtering and raping Black African civilians in areas it takes over. But so far the UAE’s wealth hassparedit the public condemnation of western governments.As for eastern DRC, the UN security council (but not the general assembly) hascondemnedRwanda’s invasion via its M23 proxy rebel group. The human rightscouncildeplored the abuses and established a monitoring and reporting mechanism that hasissuedcritical reports. TheICCis investigating (though has not yet publicly filed charges for) the atrocities and has endorsed the creation of a special tribunal for the region.Yet the international response has not been as strong as in the past. In 2013,threatsfrom London and Washington to cut aid forced the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, to stop supporting the murderous M23 rebel group that was wreaking havoc among the civilians of eastern DRC. The threats led to the M23’s collapse.Now the M23 is back, but the pro-western Kagame is being treated with kid gloves. Aided by Qatar, the Trump administration negotiated aceasefirethat Rwanda hasignoredwithout consequence. Trump’s maininterestappears to be DRC mining deals. By opting not to pressure Rwanda to end its invasion, Trump essentially greenlighted its exploitation of DRC’s mineral wealth, the civilians of the region be damned.The ICC is the obvious institution to uphold the law and prosecute offenders. Trump has sought to undermine the court by imposingsanctionson some of its prosecutors and judges, mainly for pursuing or upholding charges against Netanyahu and Gallant. But these officials havedefiedTrump’s pressure and vowed to continue their work.One serious impediment has been self-imposed. Since May 2025, the prosecutor’s office has been headless because Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor, is onleavewhile allegations that he sexually assaulted a staff member are investigated. (Khan has denied the allegations.) Rather than expeditiously resolve the matter by vindicating or firing him, the assembly of states parties – the court’s125members – has dawdled. The investigator’s report has been with them sinceDecember, but they still haven’t acted. This is irresponsible.The prosecutor’s office is being run by twodeputies, but they don’t have the stature to take the major decisions that are onhold. For example, no Israeli officials have been publicly charged for any aspect of the bombing campaign in Gaza or the settlement expansion (also awar crime) in the occupied West Bank. Putin has not been publicly charged for the bombing of civilians and civilian infrastructure under his command in Ukraine.No public charges have been filed against commanders committing atrocities in Sudan or eastern DRC, let alone against the Emirati and Rwandan officials who are aiding and abetting them. Trump and his senior officials have not been charged with obstructing justice, which his sanctions clearlydo. Given the enormous stakes, the member states should act urgently so a permanent chief prosecutor is in place.The challenges to IHL are certainly great. I would have liked to see a far stronger response. But it would be wrong to characterize that response to this lawlessness as the death knell of IHL – as the way we must accept that wars are now fought. The atrocities in Gaza,Ukraine, Sudan and eastern DRC are still rightly and widely seen as wrong, as illegal. We just need a more consistent effort to defend the victims and uphold the law.Kenneth Roth is a Guardian US columnist, visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs, and former executive director of Human Rights Watch.

Almost 200 years after publication, Emily Brontë’s tale of forbidden love and ruthless revenge inspires a devotion that makes any reinterpretation feel like a personal and proprietary affront.Into this sea of sensitivities has plunged the director Emerald Fennell, whosenew adaptationhas become one of the year’s most debated films. Dubbed “50 shades of Brontë”, everything about it has been scrutinised: from the casting of Aussies Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi as Cathy and Heathcliff to the anachronistic costumes and music, and the overt sexualisation of the plot.Detractors claim Brontë must be spinning in her grave, but this film tells us far more about contemporary culture than it does about the 19th-century novel itself. Fennell has framed the project as a highly personal interpretation, shaped by her intense response to the book at 14 – hence the inverted commas around the title.She has spoken of being “obsessed” and “driven mad” by the book, of wanting to honour its “primal, sexual” undercurrents and the shock that greeted its original publication (it was deemed “irredeemably monstrous” at the time). Purists are outraged that a novel rooted in class and racial tensions that exposes the extremes to which someone can be driven by desire and pride has been simplified to “the greatest love story ever told”. But in an attention economy only the simplest and most shocking narratives cut through.In the infinite scroll of content platforms, we are fed a steady diet of instant gratification and vibes, with diminishing space for thoughtful engagement. We live in an age where book publishing has become enmeshed with social media, asBookTokdrives sales by isolating easily digestible tropes such as “enemies to lovers”, “slow burn” and “who did this to you?”. Fennell thrives in this landscape – her films are less concerned with subtlety or nuance than with provocation. Her previous film Saltburn was a talking point not because of its delicate tensions, but for its shocking scenes of a sexual nature.View image in fullscreenMargot Robbie and Jacob Elordi at the Wuthering Heights Australian premiere in Sydney, 12 February 2026.Photograph: Hanna Lassen/Getty ImagesSo Fennell’s “Wuthering Heights” (note the quotation marks) opens with an aroused nun observing a hanged man with an erection. Cathy masturbates under a huge heathland rock while her hot surrogate brother watches on; Alison Oliver’s Isabella wears a dog collar on all fours as Heathcliff feeds her; fingers suggestively penetrate jellied fish mouths and egg yolks. This is Brontë for the permanently online generation, and it’s designed to be clipped, shared and debated.The casting, too, can be understood through this logic. Much of the backlash has focused on the decision to cast older actors, and to overlook Brontë’s description of Heathcliff as a “dark-skinned gipsy”, racially and socially othered. Those are valid criticisms. But if this Wuthering Heights is engineered for a culture shaped by virality, then its leads were always going to be stars who already existed as online darlings. Robbie is Barbie, and Elordi is everyone’s favourite internet boyfriend. Set all this against an ethereal soundtrack by the gen Z-adored Charli xcx and the method is unmistakable.‘I loved it!’: Brontë museum staff praise racy Wuthering Heights filmRead moreAdaptations of classics are always tricky, but there is nothing inherently sinful about each generation wanting period drama refracted through a new lens. Bridgerton transformed Regency romance into a glossy, sex-positive fantasy, while Netflix’s forthcoming Pride and Prejudice is penned by Dolly Alderton, the chronicler of millennial love and desire. If Clueless could transplant Jane Austen to 90s California, Fennell is well within her rights to create a sexed-up Wuthering Heights. My only complaint is that, for all the noise around its supposed transgression, it is surprisingly un-freaky, beyond a few flirtations with BDSM.Still, when I saw it on Friday night, the cinema was packed. There were squeals, gasps and, yes, tears. It was an entertaining fever dream, with beautiful cinematography and a final sequence that leaves you devastated. When fewer people are going to film theatres, it should be welcome that “Wuthering Heights”has recouped its$80m production budgeton its opening weekend. Event cinema sells tickets.Luckily, Brontë fans who can’t abide this film have countless alternatives that cleave more faithfully to the novel’s spirit, including the 1939 version with Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier, 1992’s take with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes and Andrea Arnold’s 2011 film. They should also be reassured that the controversy around the film has driven renewed interest in the book itself, withUK sales up 469% over the past year. That is one good thing Fennell lovers and haters can agree on.Nadia Khomami is arts and culture correspondent at the GuardianExplore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsOpinionEmerald FennellEmily BrontëRomance filmscommentShareReuse this content"

The racist imagery Trump posted was so egregious that the video’s misogyny representing Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as animals was overlooked. Trump’s denigration of women is implicitly assumed as business-as-usual and not newsworthy: “Quiet, piggy!” And down the memory hole are the 3m long-suppressed documents from the Epstein files in which he is mentioned in its unredacted pages “more than a million times”, according to the Democratic representative Jamie Raskin, who was permitted access.The only Black Republican US senator, Tim Scott of South Carolina, said of the Obama portrayal: “It’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House,” though Scott did not disclose any list, which could have been drawn from an encyclopedia of offenses beginningdecades beforeTrump’s birther campaign. During Trump’s first administration, in 2020, Scott chose to call out one incident as “indefensible”: Trump’s tweet of a video of a supporter chanting “white power”. Trump’s latest racist post was preceded on 11 January by his predictable vandalism of Black History Month in aninterviewwith the New York Times with a remark about the Civil Rights Act of 1964: “White people were very badly treated.”The release of Trump’s Obama video runs parallel to his systematic purge of references to slavery at numerous national parks and sites, following hisexecutive orderof 27 March 2025, “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”. At Fort Pulaski national monument in Georgia, for example, Trump officials ordered the removal of a reproduction of the infamous1863 “Scourged Back” photographof an enslaved man named Gordon with severe whipping scars. At Harpers Ferry national historical park, signs about slavery wereflagged for removal. At theKingsley plantationin Florida, exhibits of the harsh living conditions of enslaved people were ordered for inventory. The historical information at President’s House in Philadelphia noting George Washington’s slaves’ presence therewas removed.But Trump’s video and remark about civil rights has its own inescapable history. However ignorant, indifferent or contemptuous of history he may be, he has evoked the language and imagery of theinaugural addressof Governor George C Wallace of Alabama on 14 January 1963, in which Wallace decried “the tyranny that clanks its chains upon the south”, and “the international racism of the liberals seek[ing] to persecute the international white minority”, in order to transform Americans into a “mongrel unit of one under a single all-powerful government”,Mongrelization, what Wallacecalled“mongrel complexity”, was in effect Trump’s theme in his tweet about the performance of Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl half-time show. Bad Bunny, a Puerto Rican recording artist who won the Grammy this year for best album, is a critic of ICE and sings in Spanish. His performance at the Super Bowl culminated in a parade of flags, ending with that of the US and his statement “God bless America”.“It makes no sense,”complainedTrump, “is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence. Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.” Perhaps Trump is confusing Bad Bunny with Elvis, and the early objections to his dancing and his Spanish-language songGuadalajarain his 1963 movie Fun in Acapulco.In the memes of identity politics, Trump as puritan is a novelty comedy act.The Trump White House’s shambling explanation of the Obama video, trying to shift blame toan anonymous staffer, suggested an internal operation postingAI-generatedimages and videos. In October last year, Trump wasmade into a jet pilotwho bombs protesters with excrement. On 22 January, just weeks before the Obama video, the White House communications office disseminated analtered photoof Nekima Levy Armstrong, a prominent Black woman, arrested at an anti-ICE demonstration in St Paul, Minnesota, in which her skin color appears darkened and her face changed to make her appear to be crying. (Armstrong is the former director of the Minneapolis NAACP and a former law school professor.) After the digital manipulation of the Armstrong photo was exposed, Kaelan Dorr, deputy White House communications director,posted on X: “The memes will continue.”Initially, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt,defended the Obama videoas an “internet meme” and the reaction to it as “fake outrage”. Yet in the Armstrong instance, Trump’s White House wasproudly defiantabout producing it, not dismissive. Condemning “fake outrage” is the transparent projection of the outrage the Trump team regularly attempts to whip up through deepfakes. There was the doctored video in October 2025 of the Democratic House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, wearing a sombrero with mariachi music playing. “Bigotry will get you nowhere,”saidJeffries. But bigotry is the fuel of the memes.The White House’s posting operation runs from the deputy chief of staff, Dan Scavino,dubbed“the conductor of the Trump Train”, through the communications and press offices. (The White House has saidScavino wasn’t behindthe Obama post.) Leavitt’s particular role is to practice her talent for rapid-fire mendacity, instantly framing falsehoods and deflecting responsibility with an air of certitude as she is making it up.In Trump’s fumbled alibi about the Obama video, he disclosed his operation. “I didn’t see the whole thing,” Trumpsaid. “I looked at the first part … Then I gave it to the people. Generally, they look at ​the whole thing. But I guess somebody didn’t.” A phantom was blamed. Trump defended the video, half-confessing that he had given his approval. “I didn’t make a mistake,” he said.Trump’s memes are more than distractions, heckling or the self-delusions of a cult shouting into an echo chamber. Just as the Obama video was neatly succeeded by the Bad Bunny tweet, Trump’s racist rants have melded with nativist nationalism. The two episodes together crystalize his political philosophy.Like virtually all of Trump’s policies, from tariffs to immigration, and the AI cartoons of his White House image machine, Maga as a whole is an atavistic recrudescence, the return of the repressed. It is a recapitulation of the dark side of American history that cohered into the racist and nativist nationalism of a century ago in the 1920s.The Obama video is a modern repetition of the pseudo-scientific racist theory of polygenism, propounded first in the 1854 book Types of Mankind by Josiah Nott and George Gliddon, filled with illustrations of the “Negro” head to show its resemblance to a chimpanzee rather than a “Caucasian” skull to prove a natural racial hierarchy. Nottarguedthat “the negro achieves his greatest perfection, physical and moral, and also greatest longevity, in a state of slavery”.The literature of race-thinking grew to a vast proportion. In 1916, Madison Grant notably publishedThe Passing of the Great Race, a combination of social Darwinism, racism and nativism, particularly focused on the Jews destroying Nordic “purity [of] the blood”. “The agitation over slavery was inimical to the Nordic race,” he wrote, “because it thrust aside all national opposition to the intrusion of hordes of immigrants of inferior racial value, and prevented the fixing of a definite American type …” Grant served as vice-president of the Immigration Restriction League and an adviser on the Immigration Act of 1924, which prohibited eastern and central Europeans from the US. Hitler cited Grant’s book in Mein Kampf andpraisedit as “my Bible”.The second Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s emerged as enormously powerful not only as a white supremacist organization but also as a nativist one that ranked whites by nationality and blood. The 1925Klansman’s Manualstated as its “purpose”: “To unite white male persons, native-born, Gentile citizens of the United States of America”, and said “the movement is dedicated to the task of preserving the blood-purity, the integrity, the traditions, the ideals and the heritages of the white race in America”. (Fred Trump, Donald’s father, wasarrestedas a young man at a Klan rally in 1927.)Trump dabbles in Hitlerian rhetoric without the theory: “poisoning the blood” was afavorite phraseof his during the 2024 campaign. (Trumphas said he didn’t knowthis echoed Hitler.) He links blood purity to nativism with lurid depictions of immigrants as “animals” degraded by “bad genes”.The man for theory, at least one theory, in his circle is the author of his immigration policy and field marshal of ICE, Stephen Miller, who hasreportedlysought topromotea white supremacist novel, The Camp of the Saints, written in 1973 by Jean Raspail, which describes brown-skinned people from the Indian subcontinent invading and overwhelming white Europe. (The White Househas claimed Miller opposesall forms of bigotry.) Raspail was a far-right French monarchist and his work a forerunner of the great replacement theory that provides the framework, if there is one, for Maga.“This is the great lie of mass migration,”wroteMiller on X. “You are not just importing individuals. You are importing societies. No magic transformation occurs when failed states cross borders. At scale, migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands.” Miller’sgreat-great-grandfatherfled pogroms in Belarus and arrived at Ellis Island in 1903.And, Miller tweeted: “NYC is the clearest warning yet of what happens to a society when it fails to control migration.” Ad infinitum.The memes will continue.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

Protest should be policed by criminal lawMon 16 Feb 2026 13.30 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 14.11 ESTShareThe high courtruledlast week that the British government’s proscription of Palestine Action is unlawful and disproportionate. Itsjudgment, however, is hardly one in praise of militant protest. That makes it all the more awkward for ministers. The bench rejected Palestine Action’s claim that it was engaged in Gandhian civil disobedience. The judges also accepted that a number of incidents involved serious property damage that technically satisfied the statutory definition of terrorism.But they were clear and correct: the existing criminal law “is available to prosecute those concerned”. This judicial distinction between terror and crime matters – and is devastating for the government. Ministers, the bench reasoned, can’t ban every organisation that meets the legal terror threshold just because it brings “significantdisruptive benefits” to do so.Crucially, the high court found against ministers because proscription amounted to disproportionate interference with the right to protest, which rests on the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and assembly. The judges obviously had a point: the ban did not merely punish acts; it also made it an offence to belong to Palestine Action, or even to speak in support of it. That is how more than2,700 peoplefound themselves arrested after the ban – mostly for waving placards. More than 500 of those arrested have been charged.Criticsof the ruling say ministers answer to parliament alone. But MPs gave the then home secretary discretion to proscribe groups. The court, in effect, said Yvette Cooper breached her own policy on that discretion without lawful justification. The government willappeal, and the ban stands for now. An indication of the unlikelihood of the appeal succeeding is that the Metropolitan police havestoppedarresting protesters. Ministers may argue that courts should show deference to parliament, which passed the ban, and on national security grounds. But deference works both ways: judges defer to security assessments. They do not defer to overreach.This is the first successful challenge to proscription. That alone should make ministers pause. It is a disgrace that support for Palestine Action can mean14 years in prison. Until now, such bans have been used for al-Qaida,Islamic State and neo-Nazi groupswhich advocate terror and murder to achieve political ends. Palestine Action aims to disrupt British factories that it says supply and support the Israeli military. It drew attention to the rising civilian death toll in Gaza, as well as to the UK’s role in what many considered an ongoinggenocideby an ally.History has lessons. In2003, five protesters broke into RAF Fairford to sabotage equipment linked to the impending bombing of Baghdad. They argued they were acting to prevent a greater crime – the Iraq war – and were charged with criminal damage, not terrorism. The courts treated them as protesters: some were convicted and given light sentences, and others were acquitted. Notably, none were treated as terrorists, a view shared by one of their defence barristers at the time – Keir Starmer.Yet last summer, within days of Palestine Action activists breaking intoRAF Brize Nortonand splashing two planes with red paint, Sir Keir’s government announced the group’sproscription. He knows that juries can side with conscientious protesters – especially over an issue such as Gaza. Maybe he thought it better, then, to ban the group outright. If so, for a man who frequently invokes the rule of law, it is a shabby way to circumvent it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Games can be a catalyst for new grassroots investment in the UKMon 16 Feb 2026 13.29 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 14.11 ESTShareFor most of January and February, Britons have endured relentless,record-breakingrain, often accompanied by a biting wind. But in recent days many will have taken solace from contemplating a very different winter landscape, as skiers, skaters and snowboarders compete beneath the purest of blue skies. As a visual spectacle, the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics have been afeastfor the eyes and balm for the soul.Given the glory of the Dolomites, that much might have been anticipated. More unexpected was a weekend of unprecedented sportingtriumphfor Team GB. For a nation that has not traditionally been – to put it kindly – a winter sports heavyweight, two gold medals in the space of five hours on Sunday was a moment to savour. Competing in the mixed snowboard cross, Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale became the first ever British athletes to win on snow. In Milan, Tabitha Stoecker and Matt Weston hurtled down the ice track to edge out German competition in the first mixed team skeleton event.Norway, sitting once again at thetopof the medals table, will not feel that its remarkable historicdominanceis under threat just yet. But the bravura performance of Bankes – who grew up in the French Alps and began her career competing for France – was a highlight of the tournament so far. Elsewhere, targetedinvestmentis paying off.Weston, a current double world champion, was already a hot favourite. But over the last four-year cycle between Winter Olympics, UK Sport has spent millions on building up a formidable skeleton-racing team: a fourth place in the mixed event for Freya Tarbit and Marcus Wyatt reflected the growing strength in depth. For Team GB generally, the bathos of Eddie the Eagle, the spectacularlyunsuccessfulBritish ski jumper who touched the hearts of crowds at the 1988 Winter Games, is a distant memory.Britain’s most successfulWinter Olympicsever, in a time zone congenial to primetime viewing, will surely spark growing UK interest in sports that have, for cultural and climatic reasons, remained on the margins. That will test resources and outreach. In Weston, the nation may boast the best skeleton racer in the world, but it still does not possess even one suitable ice track on which those dreaming of emulating him could try their luck. The fearless Stoecker was a gymnast and trained trapeze artist before being spotted at a talent identification event. Weston himself played rugby and practised taekwondo.Hopefully Bankes’s scintillating performance on the slopes will inspire a new generation to take to the indoor variety in Britain, which have already nurtured the extraordinary talent of her fellow snowboarding starMia Brookes. But for the popular cut-through of Milano Cortina 2026 to truly launch a golden age of British winter sports, the Games should become a catalyst for further investment in grassroots participation.For now, though, the focus of many viewers will turn to an increasingly compelling andill-temperedcurling competition, in which allegations of foul play have led to calls for the use of video assistant referees or Hawk-Eye-style technology. Team GB has a chance of qualifying for the semi-finals of the men’s and women’s events, which would put more medals within touching distance in northern Italy. As we seek inspiration and distraction in the middle of a grey February, the drama may be only just beginning.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Afghan women face severe constraints on mobility, decision-making and access to healthcare, particularly in rural and remote areas where services and trained providers are scarce. But it is also important to recognise that the picture is not uniformly bleak.Despite the restrictions,DKT Afghanistan, a locally registered private-sector pharmaceutical organisation, has been able to sustain and even expand access to family planning and maternal health services by working within cultural and religious norms. In Afghanistan, family planning is often delivered as “birth spacing”, an approach that aligns with community expectations and Islamic principles.DKT Afghanistan works through more than 3,800 private outlets across 13 provinces, alongside clinics and community midwife networks in Kabul and Balkh. In 2024 alone, these services reached nearly 70,000 patients, including more than 40,000 family planning clients. That access helped avert an estimated298,000 unintended pregnancies and more than 340 maternal deaths in 2024.These gains do not negate the serious rights violations that Afghan women endure, but they do show that progress, however fragile, is still possible. Recognising what works matters, especially when international engagement is wavering. Sustaining and scaling these pragmatic, culturally grounded approaches could save lives now, while longer-term rights and freedoms remain under threat.George PapachristouRegional director, DKTAfghanistanand PakistanGigih YudhistiraCountry manager, DKT AfghanistanExplore more on these topicsAfghanistanReproductive rightsWomen's healthCharitiesContraception and family planningWomen's rights and gender equalitylettersShareReuse this content"

As your editorial states, we need to be careful not to view smaller classes as a solution to all the problems with education. During my tenure, we suffered because of the perception that larger classes were inherently worse for children.As our school grew in popularity, we experienced families moving away in search of smaller classes, which placed significant demands on our budget. Those parents did not grasp that the quality of teaching is infinitely more important than class size. If you have good teachers and a positive culture, it is possible to have high-quality interactions that support all children in a class of 30.Your editorial mentions workload as an issue, but class size is only a small part of it: 95% of workload issues stem from school cultures, which are under significant pressure from a system that does not value the “softer” aspects such as positive relationships. Until that changes, demands on workload will still drive people out of the profession.It is important to note that there are social advantages of class sizes being around 30. Having worked in schools with small cohorts, I am aware of the challenges they can bring for friendship groups.Childrenare more likely to find their tribe in a class of 30 than in a smaller setting.Andrew MarshBurnham-on-Sea, SomersetHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Learn a language because you love it, not because it’s usefulReaders respond to an article by Gary Nunn who says learning Spanish has never been coolerMon 16 Feb 2026 11.51 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 12.07 ESTShareGary Nunn misses the point of language learning in seeing it as a numbers game (Spanish is clearly now the world’s coolest language. So why do we push British children to learn French?, 10 February). Evaluating a language by its usefulness is reductive – about as soul-destroying as telling a passionate mathematician that they don’t need to bother learning complex theorems because a computer could do it.I did two language A-levels (German and Japanese) and went on to do a Japanese degree at university. Despite Japanese being less “useful” than Spanish in terms of the number of speakers, it has enriched my life in countless ways.Learning any language, be it a minority one such as Welsh or a widely spoken one such as Mandarin, is beneficial in that it teaches young people multiple skills that can then be applied in later life (and indeed to the learning of additional languages later on if the language they were taught in school is not the one they wanted to learn).It teaches them to think and communicate in a different way, gives them a greater understanding of different cultures and histories, and access to new art and media.Spanish is an incredible language, and it does it a disservice to reduce it to its “usefulness”. If we want to motivate young people to learn languages, we need to teach them to love languages rather than just seeing them as a means to an end in their future careers.Miriam StarlingLondonThe suggestion that Spanish should eclipse French in schools because it is more useful or has more native speakers reduces language education to a crude numbers game. Learning a language is not about chasing cultural trends or lifestyle optics; it is about developing cognitive flexibility, literacy, memory and cultural understanding. Pupils do not disengage because they study French rather than Spanish – they disengage when expectations are low and learning feels inaccessible.Spanish absolutely deserves its growing place, but framing this as a zero-sum contest does a disservice to pupils and teachers alike.Languagesare not popularity contests – they expand how young people think about the world, and that is their enduring value.Sean EnnisHead of modern languages, Blenheim High SchoolIn arguing that Spanish should have priority over French in British schools, Gary Nunn states: “We should tell people that in terms of employability … Spanish will serve them better than French.” I’ve got news for him. For some years now, the most sought-after modern foreign language with British employers is one he doesn’t mention:German. This is also the language that in recent years has been allowed to wither on the vine by our schools and universities.We Brits are much better at learning foreign languages than many assume when given the opportunity, a stimulating syllabus and good teachers. But we are hopeless at getting our priorities right when it comes to foreign-language provision.David HeadMalmesbury, WiltshireRe Gary Nunn’s regret at not learning Spanish now he is living inArgentina, I have just arrived in Buenos Aires for a few days and, despite having a reasonable grasp of Castilian Spanish, I cannot understand a word anyone is saying, let alone being understood here.Margot CrookshankHove, East SussexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

If his mother had died in the war and he had her picture on his helmet, would they disqualify him? If he was Christian and had a neck tattoo of a cross, would they disqualify him? This was a human tribute, not political propaganda. The IOC botched the interpretation of the rules here. I agree that they owe him an official apology.Nicholas MarkosChicago, USWell said, Lizzy Yarnold. If politics doesn’t come into Olympic sport, why isRussiabanned? Vladyslav Heraskevych’s helmet was a mark of remembrance. The other athletes should have supported him and refused to compete. The International Olympic Committee president, who was in tears over the ban, should visit Kyiv and see the tears of mothers who have lost their sons in that terrible war.Wayne GodfreyHuntley, GloucestershireIt seems to me that, perversely, the ban on Vladyslav Heraskevych has done more to highlight the human consequences of the criminal behaviour of Vladimir Putin and Russia than allowing him to compete with his remembrance helmet would have done.Johnston AndersonBeeston, NottinghamshireLizzy Yarnold’s article highlights the tug of war between freedom of expression and rules, a recurring theme in our society of late. The International Olympic Committee is against the politicisation of sport but, as its spokesman argued, with 130 conflicts around the world, “once you start, as a sporting organisation, taking stands against wars and conflicts there is no end”.

On Monday afternoon in Bormio, the Norwegian Atle Lie McGrath processed his grief in a novel way after the men’s slalom gold medal had slipped away. First, he threw his ski poles as far as he could and then he hid in the woods.“I just needed to get away from everything,” he said. “I thought I would get some peace and quiet, which I didn’t because photographers and police found me out in the woods. I just needed some time for myself.”Winter Olympics 2026: women’s big air final under way after weather delay, USA reach women’s ice hockey final – liveRead moreHis reaction was entirely understandable. The 25-year-old had hoped to honour his grandfather, who died on the day of the opening ceremony. Despite skiing in a blizzard, his opening run was smooth and clinical as he stopped the clock on 56.14sec.That gave him an advantage of 0.59 over the Swiss world champion, Loïc Meillard, into the second leg. Several of his rivals – including Lucas Pinheiro Braathen, whowon the giant slalomto give Brazil a first Winter Olympic medal in their history – had crashed out.It was there for the taking, but then it all went horribly wrong as McGrath straddled a gate. “I’m normally a guy that’s very good when it comes to perspective on things,” he said.View image in fullscreenAtle Lie McGrath trudges off the course after crashing out during the second run.Photograph: Alexis Boichard/Agence Zoom/Getty Images“If I don’t ski well in a race, I can at least tell myself that I’m healthy and my family’s healthy and the people I love are here. So that’s nice, but that’s not been the case. I’ve lost someone I love so much and that makes it really hard.”The ski poles went. TV footage then showed him lying on his back, occasionally putting his hands over his face, on the side of the course, before he trudged into the woods.View image in fullscreenBritain’s Dave Ryding waves to the crowd after his final Olympic run.Photograph: The Guardian“A mix of shock and everything in between,” he said. “I haven’t really experienced anything like it before. It’s not the worst moment of my life, but it’s the worst moment of my career. I was hoping I was going to be able to crown off this tough period with something good today.“I had to really stand through so much tough stuff and stay really strong. That makes it an extra tough one.”McGrath, who was born in Vermont and moved to Norway when he was two with his American father, Felix, and Norwegian mother, Selma Lie, denied his grandfather’s death had had a negative effect on his skiing. “With everything that’s been going on, I’ve really struggled to handle myself these past two weeks and I was so proud of my first run today,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe Winter Olympic stoat mascot, Tina, helps out with shovelling snow during heavy snowfall before the men’s slalom.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/Reuters“It’s affected me a tremendous amount, but it did not affect my focus. I honestly think he was the only reason why I was able to lead the first run and lead by so much. It takes a lot of courage and it’s really tough to stand there and think of him and want to perform when everything feels so small.”His mistake meant that victory went to Meillard, who became the first Swiss men’s Olympic slalom champion since 1948 with a combined time of 1min 53.61sec, and he had a few words of consolation for McGrath. “Atle Lie would have deserved it as well.

Britain’s Dave Ryding ended his career with a 17th-place finish in his fifthWinter Olympics, while his compatriot Billy Major was 16th.McGrath, though, was left to contemplate what might have been. “It’s hard to think that the next time I’ll be able to ski the Olympics, I will be 29 years old,” he said. “I gave myself the absolute best opportunity you could today. I skied so great and I still couldn’t get it done. That’s what really hurts.“I need quite a bit of time to process this and it’s going to be extremely tough. We’ll see how it goes, but at least I’m surrounded by great people who love me and who I love. I’m happy they’ll be here for me.“I’ve spent my time in the woods, now I’m going to spend time with the people I love, and that’s all I need.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBSkiingnewsShareReuse this content"

Then Abbey Murphy and Kendall Coyne Schofield scored in a 58-second span, prompting Lundberg to pull first-choice goaltender Ebba Svensson Traff for Emma Söderberg. Less than two minutes later, Hayley Scamurra tapped in Britta Curl-Salemme’s centering pass to make it 5-0, all but sealing the Americans’ fifth straight appearance in the Olympic final.“We’ve just been taking it game by game, period by period, shift by shift,” said Coyne Schofield, who is playing in her fourth Olympics. “Just focusing on what we did well and what we can improve on. It’s a big win tonight and we’re right where we want to be going into the gold-medal game.”US goaltender Aerin Frankel was brilliant when called upon, turning away 23 shots for her fourth win and third shutout of the tournament. The 26-year-old Olympic debutante plus backups Gwyneth Philips and Ava McNaughton have combined for five straight clean sheets and an Olympic-record scoreless streak of more than 331 straight minutes entering Thursday’s final.“The team is playing so well defensively they are making my job easy by making the plays in front of me so predictable so I can do my job,” Frankel said. “It’s hard to zoom out while you’re here and look at the big picture. When we look back on this tournament, what we have done so far has been amazing. But the job is not done yet.”The Americans’ defensive dominance has almost been overshadowed by their high-octane attack – 31 goals, 259 shots on goal and 15 different goalscorers through six games – but the ability to roll four lines and attack relentlessly starts with security in net. The US have conceded just the one goal and have yet to trail or be tied after 0-0 throughout the competition.Along the concourses ofthe brand-new 14,700-seat arenaon Milan’s south-eastern edge, hordes of well-lubricated US supporters in hockey sweaters, bald eagle costumes and every variety of star-spangled regalia waved flags and stacked pyramids from €7 pony beers as “U-S-A!” chants echoed before, during and after the goals.View image in fullscreenCanada captain Marie-Philip Poulin scored both of her team’s goals in their 2-1 semi-final win over Switzerland.Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty ImagesMany of them stuck around to watch Canada reach their eighth straight Olympic final by seeing off Switzerland behind two goals from captain Marie-Philip Poulin. The 34-year-old from Quebec, slowed by a lower-body injury during the tournament but still considered the best player on the planet, took over the all-time Olympic goalscoring record held by Canadian Hayley Wickenheiser with her 19th goal before extending it with a 20th.The US will go off as hot favorites in Thursday’s final on merit. With only 11 returning players from the teamthat won silver in Beijingfour years ago – including seven who are still in college – they have one of their youngest and fastest teams in years. Since dethroning the Canadians at last year’s world championshipson Tessa Janecke’s overtime goal, the US have won five straight in the head-to-head by a 29-7 margin, includinga 5-0 group-stage win last Tuesday.The two teams have split all seven Olympic gold medals since women’s ice hockey debuted at Nagano, with the US winning in 1998 and 2018 and Canada claiming the other five. While the Americans’ rich blend of youthful swagger and veteran poise should give them the upper hand, the Canadians will take heart in the presence of Poulin, who has notched seven of her goals in four Olympic gold medal games – earning her the nickname Captain Clutch – and remains the only man or woman to score in four separate finals.“We haven’t won against them this year, and we’re ready to take that and heartbreak them,” Canada forward Julia Gosling said. “It’s a gold-medal game so anything can happen. If we can bring the performance like we did tonight we can just push through. If we win every battle, scratch and claw, we are going to come out on top.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsIce hockeyUSA ice hockey teamUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Shaidorov won gold and Malinin finished 15th out of 24th in the free skate and eighth overall.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

The video ends with the message “21 February 2026”, the date of the exhibition gala that traditionally concludes the Olympic figure skating schedule, perhaps suggesting Malinin’s routine will be based on his recent experiences.Fall of the Quad God: Ilia Malinin finds he is all too human under the Olympic spotlightRead moreA written message alongside the video also hints atthe pressures Malinin facedin the run-up to last Friday’s routine.“On the world’s biggest stage, those who appear the strongest may still be fighting invisible battles on the inside,” Malinin wrote alongside the video. “Even your happiest memories can end up tainted by the noise. Vile online hatred attacks the mind and fear lures it into the darkness, no matter how hard you try to stay sane through the endless insurmountable pressure. It all builds up as these moments flash before your eyes, resulting in an inevitable crash. This is that version of the story.”The final title card of the video includes a book called The Psychology of Fear as well as images of computer keyboards and text messages.Malinin was quick to congratulate Shaidorov after the competition, which resulted in his worst score since the US International Classic in September 2022. He also was honest about how the pressure had affected him at the Olympics.“The nerves just went, so overwhelming,” he said, “and especially going into that starting pose, I just felt like all the traumatic moments of my life really just started flooding my head. So many negative thoughts that flooded into there and I could not handle it.”Malinin did not come away from the Olympics empty-handed.He won team goldwith the United States during the opening weekend of the Games.Explore more on these topicsIlia MalininWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsFigure skatingUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their side may have lost 1-0 on the night, their dream FA Cup run coming to an end just when a lucrative trip to West Ham’s London Stadium in the fifth round had veered into sight, but pride was the overriding emotion.Ultimately it had taken an unfortunate own goal from Sam Heathcote, a PE teacher when not playing as a part-timer in the National League North, to nudgeBrentfordof the Premier League into the fifth round.‘It fills my heart’: Andrews lauds Macclesfield for their dream FA Cup adventureRead moreFor 70 minutes Macclesfield had proven a match for their illustrious visitors and they ended their cup campaign with a 2-2 aggregate scoreline against top-flight teams after thehistoric win over Crystal Palacein the third round. No wonder fans were shouting support and patting players’ backs after the final whistle.The fact Macclesfield pushed for a late equaliser after the 70th-minute goal via Heathcote’s head spoke volumes for the resilience shown by John Rooney’s side. There will be no dream trip to play in the former Olympic Stadium, but the team from a small town in Cheshire have won some London-based admirers in the past month or so.After a battling start by the Silkmen, riding on the high of that Palace win – despite Rooney’s insistence that his squad had remained grounded after shocking the Cup holders – Brentford eventually came to terms with the hosts, perhaps learning lessons where Oliver Glasner’s side did not.View image in fullscreenMacclesfield’s Sam Heathcote is consoled by Max Dearnley after the fourth-round match.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAThe first true opening for the Premier League club came on 13 minutes when a fizzing Reiss Nelson free-kick from the left sparked a goalmouth scramble. But it was still Macclesfield, through Luke Duffy and then Paul Dawson, their captain, who created the more dangerous first-half chances, drilling goalwards after a couple of careless Brentford mistakes in possession.Andrews demanded an improvement after the break and Brentford duly began to turn the screw, sustaining pressure and refusing to panic despite the scoreline remaining goalless. The visitors started to suss out the puzzle posed by the sixth-tier side, with the youngster Romelle Donovan beginning to relish his role down the right and Vitaly Janelt and Mathias Jensen weaving a web through the middle.The introduction of Keane Lewis-Potter gave the visitors some extra thrust on the flanks, with Macclesfield sitting ever deeper to protect the 0-0 scoreline. Eventually the pressure told as Lewis-Potter made an impact, darting down the left before his cross was diverted by Heathcote past Max Dearnley in the home goal.The celebrations were almost apologetic from the Brentford players, but there was no doubt their second-half play had merited the goal. Heathcote, who had been a hero in the defeat of Palace, sunk his head to the ground. Rooney said the defender was very down in the changing room afterwards.It was extra cruel for Macclesfield given they had only 10 players on the pitch at the time of the goal: Lewis Fensome was off the field with a hamstring injury but Rooney could not get a substitute on in time.Still, Rooney, like the majority of those in Moss Rose, was left with nothing but pride after it all. “To go and replicate the Crystal Palace performance – I know we didn’t get the result – but it was outstanding,” he said. “For a club of our level to go toe-to-toe with two Premier League sides is incredible. We lost today by an own goal when we had 10 men on the pitch – that’s football. It can be cruel at times, but I could not be any prouder of the lads tonight. To go on this journey and do it all together, I’m so proud.”Rooney could be especially proud of the way Macclesfield finished the game, carving out late opportunities to give the Premier League side one final scare. They launched one final assault and D’Mani Mellor, their young forward, found himself in striking distance of goal three times in the space of a minute but was thwarted on each occasion, lastly by the Bees’ keeper Hákon Valdimarsson. It was hardly a case of Brentford marching on to the fifth round; more sneaking through and a crisis averted for Andrews and his men.Explore more on these topicsFA CupMacclesfieldBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Coventry, pace-setters for the majority of the season, had won just four league games since the end of November. But Haji Wright hit a timely hat-trick as Coventry again traded places withMiddlesbrough, whose six-game winning run came to an abrupt halt, to renew belief in these parts.Riley McGree pulled a goal back midway through the second half but from the restart Boro conceded a penalty that allowed Wright to claim the match ball. Coventry’s lead may be a single point but this felt a significant victory, psychologically as much as anything, their having taken just 16 from the previous available 39. “There have been quite a few questions asked and I think the lads should get a lot of credit,” Lampard said. “It was a big game, a really good game, which probably showed why we are one and two in the league. We have to take this as a bit of a template of what has to go into a game.”Are we all Evangelos Marinakis? Why there has never been less patience with managers | Jonathan WilsonRead moreFor Kim Hellberg, by his own admission a “lazy” midfielder who grew up idolising Lampard but turned to coaching aged 23, this was disappointing but not a disaster. Whenhe took charge in November, Boro trailed Coventry by 10 points. On this evidence, while Hellberg bemoaned the manner of the goals Boro conceded, his team will surely run Coventry close as the pair fight for automatic promotion. “There are 14 games left to play and it’s going to be a battle,” Hellberg said. “It will probably be a race until the last day.”There was a big-game energy in the moments before kick-off: fireworks shooting into the sky, pyrotechnics sparkling and the Enemy, the Coventry band whose We’ll Live and Die in These Towns has been adopted as a club anthem, blaring. The match itself was entertaining from the first whistle, Tommy Conway bounding into Joel Latibeaudiere after Coventry got things under way on halfway and Wright sent a header against a post inside 99 seconds, rising above Luke Ayling to flick Tatsuhiro Sakamoto’s floated cross towards goal. It was a breathless contest between not only first v second in the second tier but also the teams with the best home and away records in the division.Coventry came into this game winless in three matches and fresh from beingheld to a 0-0 drawat home to struggling Oxford United. They seized the advantage on 21 minutes. Wright started and finished the move but the true catalyst was Sakamoto, who twirled clear of Conway and then Hayden Hackney before locating Jack Rudoni who squared the ball. Wright’s first-time finish went through the legs of the Boro goalkeeper Sol Brynn.View image in fullscreenHaji Wright fires Coventry ahead during the first half.Photograph: Ryan Browne/ShutterstockLampard’s side looked to Carl Rushworth’s booming kicks to put Boro’s back line under pressure and approaching the hour the hosts doubled their lead in direct fashion. The on-loan Brighton goalkeeper wellied the ball downfield and as it bounced 20 yards from the Boro goal, it became clear that Ayling was in a spot of bother. When the ball bounced a second time, Wright sent a nerveless finish into the far corner of Brynn’s net.Hackney vented his frustrations after the referee, Thomas Bramall, inadvertently prevented Boro shifting the ball through the middle of the pitch. Boro had begun the second half encouragingly, Morgan Whittaker heading over from a McGree cross and Rushworth held an effort by Hackney after an intricate move. Hellberg freshened things up by introducing Jeremy Sarmiento and David Strelec and within a couple of minutes Boro hit the woodwork themselves when Sarmiento cracked a curling shot against a post.Eventually Boro got their reward, McGree lashing in on the half-volley but the joy proved short-lived. Within 17 seconds of the restart Matt Targett was penalised for handling a cross from the Coventry substitute Josh Eccles and the hosts restored their two-goal cushion. Eccles held the ball before handing it over for Wright to do the rest from the spot.“We can’t over celebrate,” Lampard said, mindful of back-to-back games at West Brom and Sheffield United on the horizon.“There are so many points to fight for. We’ve got ourselves in this position, Boro are there, Ipswich are always going to be there because of their squad and the coach, there’s other teams around it, Millwall etc. It’s game on.”Explore more on these topicsChampionshipCoventry CityMiddlesbroughmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But the game always provides context and, last Friday afternoon, the 54-year-old former Lions hooker and Irish captain drove to Cork to watch his youngest son, Tom, play for Ireland against Italy in the Under‑20Six Nations.The previous weekend Tommade his first-team debutfor Munster to match his dad and the grandfather he never met. Gordon Wood played for Munster, as well as Ireland and the Lions, before he died, aged 50, in 1982. Keith was only 10 when that first tragedy occurred but he went on to play for the same three teams as his dad.Revitalised Scotland trample all over Steve Borthwick’s lofty ambitions | Robert KitsonRead moreWood has three rugby-playing sons – Alexander and Gordon are his other boys – and he talks about how they gave him so much beautiful life after he had been besieged by death.There is a third Gordon in this story. Gordon Wood was Keith’s big brother and, in September 2002, he suffered a massive heart attack and died at the age of 42. “It was two days before Alexander was born,” Wood recalls, “and our mother died about three months afterwards.”Wood was 30 and had recently been named world rugby’s player of the year. We talk about grief and acceptance rather than personal achievement and Wood says: “I look back and don’t get maudlin at all. There were still some amazing things even though I missed the funeral and I missed the birth. Alexander was born at Chelsea & Westminster hospital and they’d been prompted that my brother had just died. When I walked into the atrium an orchestra was practising [Mozart’s] The Magic Flute. So that’s the music in my memory of that extraordinarily stressful time.”All these years later Wood is just as balanced. “Someone said to me: ‘Your father played for Ireland, you played for Ireland and now Tom is playing. You must be very proud?’ I said: ‘Well, pride is the wrong word. My pride in my son does not rely on somebody else selecting him. We’re really happy for him, but I see how hard all my kids work.’View image in fullscreenKeith Wood, then Ireland captain, celebrates a win over England in Dublin in October 2001.Photograph: Chris Bacon/PA“I love what the game has given them. Alexander has had five operations and so he’s not going to achieve in the sport. But what rugby has given him at 23 in terms of courage and resilience is stunning. All three of them are at university and the other two are in the academy at Munster. It’s difficult to do both at once because they leave at 6.30 most mornings and aren’t back until very late at night.”Wood didn’t fly to Glasgow to watch Tom’s Munster debut. “Rugby was only one part of our house and never the be-all and end‑all,” he says. “That was drummed in by my mother who was very strong. So when it comes to my boys I only want them to play if they like it.“I’ve been very keen on trying to alleviate any pressure. So I turn up to as many of their matches as I can without committing to going to all of them. I missed some big days when they started because I think that’s more appropriate. I’m not going to say it’s nothing to do with me, but it’s really nice for them to have their day without any mention of me.”That healthy reflection means Wood is ideally placed to offer a measured insight into Irish rugby. He was Ireland’s talisman for most of his 58 Tests when, between 1994 and 2003, Irish rugby often struggled. Wood seemed to have enough fire and intelligence to shoulder the frailties of his entire team.In contrast, for the past eight years Ireland have been a force in the international game. As Wood considers their more uneven present form before facing England away on Saturday, he says: “On any sine curve you’ll have peaks and troughs. I don’t believe we’re in a trough but people look at it with a sense of recency bias. I hate the idea of jumping on the bandwagon that pundits do after either a good performance or a poor performance.”The Six Nations began withIreland being thumped in Paris– as an imperious France swept into a 22-0 lead at half-time. Ireland showed more fight after the break but still lost 36-14. Wood recalls: “After the game, [Ireland’s head coach] Andy Farrell said Ireland lacked intent. That’s important. In the first 20 minutes, if you don’t match France’s passion, aggression and innate confidence, which is pretty jaw-dropping in Paris, the game drifts away. Our forwards didn’t get into the game quickly enough and we distanced ourselves from the physicality required to blunt their edge.“Some of our players are getting old. Some have been coming back from injury. In the year after a Lions series, every player that went on that tour is wrecked [Ireland supplied 15 members ofthe 38-man squad]. It takes a huge amount out of you physically and mentally, so Ireland look a bit jaded and flat.View image in fullscreenItaly’s full-back Lorenzo Pani climbs highest at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday as theAzzurrigave Ireland a huge test.Photograph: Paul Faith/AFP/Getty Images“We are in a dip, without a shadow of doubt. We need to bring younger, more powerful players through. A few years ago people said Ireland’s system was the best ever. I said the system was very good, but not the best ever for the simple reason everybody catches up. Everything goes in cycles. I don’t think we’ll fall to the bottom of the barrel but we might have a few hard losses and we have to rebuild.”Last SaturdayIreland beat Italy 20‑13in Dublin. Wood was thoroughly entertained and impressed by Italy. He dismisses the misconception that theAzzurriare easy to beat: “Italy did so much so well and, for the want of a drifting ball, could have beaten Ireland. That doesn’t mean Italy are near the top of the world but their curve is moving upward.”Wood praises the players Ireland brought in against Italy – highlighting the impact of the Ulster centre Stuart McCloskey, who threw aquarterback-style passto set up Robert Baloucoune’s stunning try at a pivotal moment. “Ireland made lots of changes and there was a freshness to some of the players coming in. McCloskey is [33] and I’d retired at that age. With him you can talk about a freedom of spirit in his thinking. He’s had the disappointment of not being picked but he’ll take a risk and that’s brilliant. His out‑of-the-box thinking led to an unbelievable Irish try.“I’ve got a huge regard for what Joe Schmidt [Farrell’s predecessor] did with Ireland but it was incredibly manufactured and reliant on one or two people pulling every string. It’s great when you’re winning but, if people figure you out, you don’t have much to fall back on. Andy Farrell is trying to make changes to that style but he knows Ireland need wins at the same time. Italy played a far more interesting game, and we needed a couple of extra bits to get past them, but I’m happy with the way it all worked out.”England were on a roll, having won 12 games before their visit to Edinburgh, and Wood thinks that some of the more adventurous elements of Premiership clubs such as Northampton were having a positive influence on Steve Borthwick’s often staid team. But Scotland were superb and England wilted ina 31-20 defeat.“England went in saying: ‘We have a gameplan, which we know works, and we’re going to be able to beat them using it,’” Wood argues. “I’m not going to call that arrogance. I’m going to call that a level of certainty from a pretty young team. But imagine how much they are hurting now and how beneficial that hurt is for them.“They got knocked off their kilter and lost their way in the midst of it. I also thought they were complaining quite a lot and my recommendation would be to stop talking to the ref and leave it to the captain. But that’s just one part of the story. Scotland were exceptional. They were exhilarating and their level of aggression and discipline was a joy to watch.”View image in fullscreenKeith Wood with ball in hand against Australia on the Lions tour of 2001: ‘It takes a huge amount out of you.’Photograph: David Davies/PATurning to France, Wood says of their head coach: “I’m fascinated by Fabien Galthié.I know him pretty welland he’s unusual in his thinking. He picked a squad with second-rows that were back-row players. [Against Ireland] he picked a pack that were really good scrummagers and they didn’t scrum in the game. They just held the scrum. They didn’t go up in a lineout once. They didn’t play like they traditionally do in the Pro 14 and grind it out. They tried to run the Irish players around the field with ball in hand and got into the game incredibly quickly.“Galthié surprised everybody by dropping some great players. But then you look at the performance of the players he’s picked instead and it’s been extraordinary. We’ll see whether he sticks with that or whether they go back to some of the heavy guys for heavy matches. I would say there’s a requirement to do both.”Could Francebecome the second northern hemisphere country to win the World Cup next year? “Absolutely. France have the ability to beat anybody. They also have an ability to beat themselves. It looks as if Galthié is saying: ‘We know we have great experience, great power and unbelievable gas.’ They’re my favourite team to watch. I obviously want Ireland to win but France play the best rugby.”We spend a couple of hours talking about Wood’s life and his enduring delight in rugby. Just before we end I ask how it was to watch Tom, playing at fly-half, as he scored 10 points and helped to steer Ireland Under-20s toa thrilling 30-27 victoryagainst Italy last Friday night. “It was bloody freezing in Cork,” he says with a smile. “But I thought Italy were unbelievably good. Their handling and their physicality is extraordinary. It was a seesaw game.“Under-20s rugby is fantastic to watch. A lot of mistakes are made but players try things that a senior team wouldn’t. There’s joy and a freedom to it. Sport is tough, and you never know where it’s going to end. This could be their high-water mark as players and, if it is, my God you have to enjoy it.”It was Tom’s birthday last Saturday and, as Wood pauses, I think of all the words he has shared about life and death. He’s no longer a dad to any teenagers and Wood sounds suitably reflective when he tells me: “There’s a Muhammad Ali quote which is one of my favourites: ‘A man who views the world the same at 50 as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life.’”Wood also says: “I really loved my career, but I wish I’d enjoyed it more and soaked it up a little more.” But he sounds as proud as he is wise when, thinking of his 20‑year‑old son, Wood suggests: “There’s one thing I would say for Tom, and it’s pretty much the only thing I’d say for him. His feet are firmly on the ground. He’s appreciating every minute of rugby and life.”Explore more on these topicsIreland rugby union teamSix Nations 2026Six NationsRugby unioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Under the lights here in Kolkata they did enough to beat Italy and secure a spot in this T20 World Cup’s Super 8s, though again without establishing themselves among the form teams of the tournament.Harry Brook had declared he would “rather not start amazing and finish amazing than start amazing and finish bad”, and in that sense alone it is proceeding entirely according to plan. The next stage is unlikely to be so forgiving.Sri Lanka v Australia: T20 World Cup cricket – liveRead more“They were better than us for quite a lot of the game,” said Will Jacks, whose 22-ball 53 was decisive. “Winning ugly is important, but hopefully we’ve had enough practice at that and we don’t have to do it again, because it is nerve-racking.“Coming in to today, my own expectation was: ‘We want to win easily. We don’t want it to be that close and feel those nerves.’ We’ve done it the hard way, we’ve not made it easy, but the most important thing is we’re on to the Super 8s.”Once again the full member nation beat the associate, but they endured plenty of awkward moments along the way. Set a target of 203 and reduced to one for two at the end of their first over, Italy simply refused to accept they were beaten.Even when they needed 64 from the last four overs, with three wickets remaining, they kept going: Grant Stewart, on his way to 45 off 23, hit two sixes off Jofra Archer’s final over and two more off Adil Rashid’s and suddenly English nerves were jangling again.Sam Curran then did his death‑overs thing, Jamie Overton finished the job and Italy were all out for 178, England winning by 24.Ben Manenti’s innings of 60 off 25 will grab the attention, but this was an excellent all-round performance from Italy. There were a couple of mistakes in the field, but their catching was impeccable, most notably Anthony Mosca, stooping while sprinting forwards from deep backward square leg to dismiss Phil Salt. Their batting, as the world’s 23rd-ranked team facing No 3, was ambitious, brutal and, at times, brilliant.View image in fullscreenItaly’s Ben Manenti and England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler watch the ball fly during Italy’s chase.Photograph: Dibyangshu Sarkar/AFP/Getty Images“Every player went for their shots straight away,” said Jacks, whose two overs went for 34. “The opener tried to hit Archer for six second ball, that signalled their intent. Every time we got a wicket, they kept coming.“I felt I had to be completely on the mark or else I was going to go out the ground. That’s not a great place to be as a bowler.”Manenti and Justin Mosca produced the best partnership of the match and for every moment they were at the crease England’s grip on victory appeared less secure. Coming together with their team 22 for three they added 92 off 48, hauling Italy from apparently inevitable disaster and back into contention.England were able to breathe – though even then only briefly – when Manenti’s vicious assault on a Jacks over, which had already brought him two sixes and two fours, ended with him picking out Tom Banton at long-on.It had been Jacks’s explosive half-century that powered England towards a match‑winning total, the 27-year-old inspiring a late acceleration during which their score bloomed from a concerning 124 with five overs and five wickets remaining to a much more mighty 202.It became in certain respects the innings this team is built for, plumbing the full extent of their batting depth with something that resembled efficiency: Archer, the only player not classified as a batter or an all-rounder who had to strap on his pads, came in with three balls remaining and faced one of them.If the view at the end of their journey was handsome enough, the route there was often ugly. Much about England’s innings was wearyingly familiar, starting with the fate of their openers. As he had against Scotland in their previous match, Jos Buttler sent a leading edge looping high to mid-on after scoring three off four.Salt, who in England’s second game scored 30 off 14 against West Indies before being caught in the deep, scored 28 off 15, but met an identical fate.This partnership has been one of the team’s great strengths, but when they falter their teammates seem, at best, uncertain, flirting occasionally with panic.But if no batter until Jacks stayed around for long enough to chisel their name into the headlines, most made useful contributions. Like the team in this group stage they did not did excel, but they did just enough.“We’ve still got time to peak,” Jacks said. “The overriding theme is success, because we did what we wanted to do. I’m very happy with that, but we know we can be a lot better.”Explore more on these topicsT20 World Cup 2026England cricket teamT20 World CupTwenty20CricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Replays showedBastoni had clearly simulatedthe fall. Juventus officials and fans argued that the decision heavily influenced the game, which Inter won 3-2, despite theBianconerihaving fought back to level the score with 10 men.Juventus red card fury overshadows thrilling Derby d’Italia battle with Inter | Nicky BandiniRead moreAfter the match, La Penna was subjected to abarrage of abuse on social media, including dozens of death threats – some directed at his family –with users posting messagessuch as: “I’ll shoot you;” “I’ll kill you;” and: “We’re coming to get you, we know where you live.”The referee has filed a formal complaint over the online attacks and, according to several Italian outlets includingLa RepubblicaandSportMediaset, police have advised him to remain at home for the time being.According to sources within the Italian referees’ association (AIA), La Penna could face a one-month suspension. Reports from figures close to the AIA suggest he could be stood down after what the Serie A chief refereeing officer, Gianluca Rocchi, described as“a clearly wrong decision”.Juventus players appealed desperately for a video assistant referee intervention, but officials are not permitted to review second yellow cards. Bastoni, already on a booking, should have received a second yellow card for simulation.“La Penna is mortified and we stand by him, but I have to tell you the truth: he wasn’t the only one who made a mistake,”Rocchi said via the AIA. “Yesterday there was a clear simulation – the latest in a long series in a league where they try in every possible way to deceive us.”Bastoni was also subjected to abuse online, prompting the defender and his wifeto disable comments on his social media accounts. He had celebrated after Kalulu’s dismissal, a gesture some supporters deemed unsporting, leading to calls for him to be dropped from the Italy squad.“You can’t talk about football today,” said the former Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini, Juventus’s director of football strategy. “Something unacceptable happened.”At half-time, the club’s chief executive, Damien Comolli, had to berestrained from confronting La Penna. The Juventus manager, Luciano Spalletti, was also seen remonstrating with the referee as the teams headed down the tunnel, though he appeared to recognise the situation was spiralling when Comolli arrived, turning to push him away.“Juventus lost three points, but Italian football lost much more,” Comolli said. Comolli and Chiellini risk disciplinary sanctions.Piotr Zielinski scored Inter’s winner from the edge of the area in the 90th minute, seven minutes after Manuel Locatelli had equalised.Explore more on these topicsSerie ARefereesJuventusInternazionaleEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Both decisions were entirely explicable in their own terms. Frank had won only two of his previous 17 league games and Dyche only two of his previous 10. Both saw the improvement of West Ham under Nuno Espírito Santo and felt the drag of potential relegation. When fear sets in and something has to change, football tends to sacrifice the manager.Excluding caretakers and interims, their departures take the number of Premier League managers to leave their jobs this season to eight, withOliver Glasner to comeat the end of the season, when Marco Silva and Andoni Iraola are also out of contract. Last season there were 10 departures, in 2023-24 nine, in 2022-23 an absurd 18. To give a little context, in the first season of the Premier League, 1992-93, there were only four changes (five if you include Dave Webb at Chelsea, who was effectively an interim, although he did not officially have that title). The average life span of a Premier League manager has dropped from about four seasons to about a season and a half.Tottenham job has become a public meat grinder and the fans’ pain is more content | Barney RonayRead moreVolatility is just part of the game. English football used to laugh at the chaotic world of Italy, but has adopted the idea of the “ferryman” who will pilot a club to the end of the season; pretty much every article describing Igor Tudor, who will lead Tottenham through to the summer, dutifully explained that he is what Italians term a “un traghettatore”.In part, it’s a general condition – and the average reign of a Premier League manager would be shorter were it not for Pep Guardiola and his decade at Manchester City – but Spurs and Forest, perhaps, represent particular cases. Tottenham have started to look unmanageable, having cycled through six permanent managers (and four interims or caretakers) since moving into their new stadium in 2019, as though the elevated environment has created an expectation with which the squad-building cannot keep up. Forest, meanwhile, now on their fourth manager of the season, are a product of their owner, the combustible Evangelos Marinakis.But there is a more general trend. The role of the manager has undergone a curious evolution. When league football first began at the end of the 19th century, the team would usually be selected by the board of directors, possibly in conjunction with the captain. The secretary-manager, as he used to be styled, was an administrator, somebody who booked the trains and hotels and sorted out the contracts. Only in very rare cases, such as Tom Watson, who won three league titles at Sunderland and two at Liverpool, would he actually run the team. As Barney Ronay argues in his book The Manager, although figures such as Herbert Chapman at Huddersfield and Arsenal took an interest in tactics and team-building, one of the main attractions of the manager for a club’s directors was that he could be used as a scapegoat. When results were going awry, it was useful to have a beleaguered figure on the touchline to absorb criticism.After the second world war, though, managers became much bigger personalities. The likes of Matt Busby, Bill Shankly, Don Revie and Brian Clough ran their clubs in their own image; they became the most important person at their club. That characterisation continues to an extent with the likes of Guardiola and Mikel Arteta, but the key figure at the modern club is once again the owner. It may seem paradoxical when football has become so stratified that managers are changed so often – how much difference can he really make? – but he is once again expendable.And this is an age in which leaders do not, generally, tend to last long. The UK has had five prime ministers in seven years. In Australia, the Liberals have had five leaders in eight years. Turnover among chief executives in the world’s largest listed companies reached new highs in 2025, after a record in 2024, 21% above an eight-year average. In part,as an article in the Financial Times argued, that’s a result of global turmoil, from conflict in the Middle East and Europe to Donald Trump’s tumultuous style of government. But it’s also about impatience from activist shareholders, with a 40% increase in US CEOs toppled after their campaigns.Voters, shareholders and fans have never had less patience. That may in itself be a reaction to a rapidly changing world as new challenges demand new leaders. But it may also be that in a social media age in which every gripe is highlighted and complaints swell, in which algorithms promote discontent and performative fury is good business, long-termism is impossible. Maybe we’re all Marinakises now.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

But they still managed to upset Atlético MadridSid LoweMon 16 Feb 2026 15.51 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 18.01 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleOne day in November, the coach of Rayo Vallecano decided that was it: he was out. The captain in whom he finds strength hadreached a similar conclusionlong ago, handing in his armband as an act of protest and dignity. Two Fridays ago, the squad signed a statement saying theycouldn’t carry onlike this. And last Friday, the fans who’ve been through it all before decided they too would walk away. Yet 48 hours later, after another week that proved them right, resisting everything, there they were still, celebrating another implausible success, another day when they had stuck it to The Man. If not, admittedly, the man they’d like to stick it to.Actually, ‘there’? Not all of them were in the same place, even if that was a way of showing they were in this together. Because Rayo fans were out on the streets of the self-styledindependent republic of Vallecaswith their banners and scarves and songs on Sunday, while their team and coach were 10km south, playing in a different city. With their training ground unusable and their home home ground declared to be so too, they had to prepare at Getafe’s place and play at Leganés’s stadium. Where, in front of 9,000 empty seats, and kicking off in the relegation zone, they only went and beat Atlético Madrid 3-0, three days after Diego’s Simeone’s side hadbattered Barcelona 4-0.Football doesn’t always make sense, which is what makes it brilliant, and a lot of the time Rayo Vallecano make even less, which is what makes them what they are. Still the smallest side inprimera, they play in a ground built into thebarriothat has only three sides, the fourth a wall where a Fede Valverde shot literally flew over and into a living room in the tower block behind. But that isn’t the problem: they’re proud of who they are and the home they have, proud of the team they support and the side’s almost absurd ability to overcome the odds, this season resisting Madridand Barcelonain Vallecas and heading into Europe25 years later. The problem that is the odds are stacked so heavily against them, and from within.Quick GuideGirona stun BarcelonaShowBarcelona blow chance to retake top spotGirona came from behind to beat visitors Barcelona 2-1 in La Liga on Monday, as last season’s champions failed to return to the summit, leaving Real Madrid top of the table.Barcelona struck the woodwork twice in the first half, Raphinha hitting the post before Lamine Yamal fired a penalty against the same upright in added time after Dani Olmo was fouled inside the box.Pau Cubarsi finally put the visitors ahead in the 59th minute, rising to head home Jules Koundé’s cross from a short corner but Girona levelled three minutes later when Thomas Lemar converted from close range after Vladyslav Vanat’s cross caused confusion.Fran Beltran (pictured) sealed victory in the 87th minute, steering home from Joel Roca’s pass as the Montilivi stadium erupted.Barcelona pushed for an equaliser but could not break through, even after Roca was sent off in added time. Barça remain on 58 points, two behind Real Madrid, and have lost successive games in all competitions for the first time since October.ReutersPhotograph: Siu Wu/EFEWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.These days supporters ask only one thing of the president and owner, Raúl Martín Presa, repeatedly, vociferously and to his face: that he leave. Hecalled them “drunk, brainless and idle”, the provocation constant, and the situation so unpleasant it is hard to believe he keeps going. Not least because the deterioration of the club. Óscar Trejo – the man who realised the best thing he could do as captain was to stop being captain – described it as a place where there was“problem after problem”. The list is endless and documented at a club that lives in isolation from the rest of the league and is somehow allowed to, a law unto itself, embarrassing for everyone.The stadium and training ground are municipally owned and Presa is pushing the Madrid government for a move to a new ground, something the coach says would be “devastating”. Rayo backed La Liga’sCVC dealto bring investment to clubs, who would be forced to use at least 70% for development or infrastructure, but have not taken the money. Staff have long paid for equipment out of their own pockets and when players returned for pre-season, they couldn’t work at the training ground, where there was a fungal infection on the grass. The players have said there has been a lack of hot water in the showers on some days.View image in fullscreenRayo’s Nobel Mendy rises for a header against Atlético.Photograph: Pierre-Philippe Marcou/AFP/Getty ImagesThe stadium is even worse, rubbish and rubble piling up, cables hanging out, chunks of cement breaking off; toilets are filthy, even for a football stadium. You can romanticise humility, embrace earthiness – and they do – but this is something more basic, something beyond that: simple hygiene. The facilities are almost laughably poor, Lech Poznan’s surprised kit man publishing a video: no light, boxes stacked up, a couple of plastic chairs, a few coat hangers and the old multicoloured towels stacked up in the dressing room looking like a scene from your granny’s airing cupboard. The playing surface wasn’t good either, and don’t think that suited them, the classic sneaky trick of the small team: under thecoach Íñigo Pérez, Rayo would rather play and, he lamented, they couldn’t on this. The full-back Pep Chavarría called the pitch “a disgrace”. “Not even good enough for the regional football,” according to his teammate Álvaro García. Patches had been put down, but it didn’t work. Then last week, 10 days after facing Osasuna, they started to relay the whole thing, four days before facing Oviedo and in the middle of the wettest month anyone could remember. They hadn’t finished 24 hours before kick-off. What could possibly go wrong?On the Friday morning, Rayo’s players turned up for training in the stadium, took one look and left. Patience worn down, that afternoon they put out a statement with the players’ union outlining the issues they faced and calling for “worthy working conditions”. But it wasn’t until a little after 10am the following morning, less than four hours before kick-off, thatLa Ligaunilaterally announced the postponement, mumbling something vague about climatic conditions and Rayo having tried their best, when they really hadn’t tried at all. That weekend only one game in the Madrid region was postponed “because” of the weather, at any level and any age group: this one. Oviedo supported the Rayo players’ demands, they said, but this wasn’t an accident; it was negligence.Rayo’s own fans agreed – they had seen it all before – and that position seemed reinforced whena week later, La Liga decided that, never mind Oviedo on 7 February, the pitch wasn’t read to face Atlético on 15 February. This time Rayo’s players and coach thought it could be ready but, with the team having to prepare at Getafe’s HQ because the training ground was no better, they were forced take on Atlético at second division Leganés, five tables set up outside at Rayo’s training ground so that season-ticket holders could queue for a ticket. With supporters’ groups calling for a boycott, not even a third came. A Mariachi band did, standing at the gates and singing Paquita la del Barrio’s “Rat on two legs”, dedicated to Presa. “Scum of the earth,” it runs, “how much damage you have done. Cockroach, bloodsucker, hyena, snake … the lowest beasts are nothing compared to you.”Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowElche 0-0 Osasuna; Real Madrid 4-1 Real Sociedad; Sevilla 1-1 Alavés; Getafe 2-1 Villarreal; Espanyol 2-2 Celta Vigo; Mallorca 1-2 Real Betis; Levante 0-2 Valencia; Rayo Vallecano 3-0 Atlético Madrid; Oviedo 1-2 Athletic ClubWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.So it was that on Sunday, as kick-off came, thousands of Rayo fans stayed at home and 2,000 marched through Vallecas. At Butarque meanwhile 5,335 people turned up to watch Rayo and Atlético. In truth, that was more than they hoped but most did so torn and apologetically: their struggling team needed them, they reasoned. It was still only a quarter of the members and it led to the lowest attendance since the pandemic, the sad, damaging sight of empty seats, something soulless about it all. “People say: ‘This is the drop that sees the glass overflow,’” Pérez said, the Spanish equivalent of straw on a camel’s back. “But the glass is broken, and that’s the danger.”Drop by drop, the surprise was not that Rayo went into Sunday’s game in exile and the bottom three, facing relegation for the first time in five years; it was that it hadn’t happened much, much earlier. And that, by the end of it, they were out again. ThatRayo Vallecano, the team that don’t make sense, the club that is completely, marvellously out of place in Europe, did it again. The week that Lech Poznan came, Pérez admits he was “emotionally out, and it had nothing to do with football”. But that night, 2-0 down after 40 minutes, they came back to secure a 3-2 win that healed and he is still there. Against Barcelona, they wouldn’t be beaten. Against Madrid, they wouldn’t be either. And, in a third “home” game against the big three, nor would they be against Atlético.View image in fullscreenRayo Vallecano defender Alfonso Espino fights for the ball with Nahuel Molina.Photograph: Pierre-Philippe Marcou/AFP/Getty Images“I hope this helps us avoid relegation,” Andrei Ratiu said. “We would have liked our fans close and understand those that didn’t come.

We needed this win.” They had deserved it too: goals from Fran Pérez, Óscar Valentín and Nobel Mendy had the Final Countdown booming round Butarque, Atlético broken. At full-time they bundled back into the dressing room, leaping about second division facilities better than theirs. “We’re happy after the week we’ve had,” said the captain, Valentín, a tinge of sadness sinking in as he offered an eternal truth for his team: “It hasn’t been easy to focus on the game.”Nor was it about the game, but something bigger, the coach insisted. “This is one of the best wins in a sporting sense, but it’s not a special day,” Pérez said. “It’s a bitter day for Rayo’s people, I can’t say differently. I won’t fall into the hypocrisy of saying: ‘We’ve won, it’s a happy day.’ Today is a day to be with those having a bad time, a day to think, to help, to empathise, a day to feel sad.”PosTeamPGDPts1Real Madrid2434602Barcelona2340583Villarreal2318454Atletico Madrid2417455Real Betis2410416Espanyol24-4357Celta Vigo245348Real Sociedad24-1319Athletic Bilbao24-73110Osasuna2403011Getafe24-82912Sevilla24-82613Alaves24-92614Valencia24-122615Girona23-152616Elche24-42517Rayo Vallecano23-92518Mallorca24-102419Levante23-141820Oviedo23-2316Explore more on these topicsLa LigaEuropean club footballRayo VallecanoAtlético MadridfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The announcement came a week after compatriot Joshua wasinvolved in a car crashin Nigeria which killed his close friends Sina Ghami and Latif “Latz” Ayodele.Any plans for Fury and Joshua to finally fight in 2026 have since been delayed, but Fury did acknowledge the part played by his old rival in his latest comeback. “Tomorrow might not ever come and I suppose the biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened withAnthony Joshua,” Fury said at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.“I was on holiday with my family in Thailand for Christmas just to get away from the rain. I was sick of the rain, it was depressing me and then I hear all about the bad news that’s gone on and I thought: ‘You know what, life is very, very short and very precious and very fragile and anything can happen at any given moment.’“You should never put things off until tomorrow, or next year, or next week because tomorrow is not promised to nobody. The Bible says tomorrow is not a gift, tomorrow ain’t promised, tomorrow is a mystery so we have to live for today.“Me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then I was going to come back to boxing because it’s something I love, I am passionate about and I have always been in love with. There is no tomorrow so that’s why I am back today.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingTyson FuryAnthony JoshuanewsShareReuse this content"

Some people simply say just get all under-16s off social media, and that’s the end of it. NSPCC, obviously an organisation very concerned with children’s protection, says no, it’ll push children to even darker places.“Others – I was with young people this morning, 15- and 16-year-olds who are actually going to be affected by this – they said to me, look we get our news from social media, we don’t read the papers, and therefore you’ll stop us accessing the news. We need to look at all of this in the round.”Downing Street has announced plans to rush through any changes recommended after the consultation by tabling amendments to two bills already going through parliament, the children’s wellbeing and schools bill, and the crime and policing bill.The plan would be for these amendments to create powers for ministers to implement various plans, with the children’s bill covering social media and the crime bill closing possible loopholes connected to AI chatbots. This would, Starmer said, allow rapid action.“We’ve taken the powers to make sure we can act within months, not years,” he said. “We also need to act very quickly, not just on the age concern, but on the devices and applications that make the sort of auto-scrolling, the constant glueing to the machine that you can never stop scrolling.”He added: “I don’t think there’s a parent in the country who isn’t worried about this, by the way, I really don’t. The status quo, things as they are now, is not good enough. Nobody can make the argument that things can be left as they are. They can’t, they’re not protective of children, and we intend to act.”Asked if MPs and peers would get a chance to debate and vote on the specifics of any policy which emerged, as well as just the amendments to empower them happening, Downing Street indicated this would be the case. “Both houses will have to approve the secondary legislation which will deliver the policies,” Starmer’s official spokesperson said, pointing reporters to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) for details. DSIT was contacted for comment.In anearlier poston his Substack page, Starmer expanded on his worries about social media, setting out that he believed that in its current form it harmed children. “When Facebook first launched in 2004, it was a pretty simple concept,” he wrote. “Make a profile, post updates that people could look at in the order they were posted, like and comment on what your friends had to say.“That is a world away from the algorithms, endless scrolling, For You pages and private chats that make up the modern world of social media. In the past 20-plus years, social media has evolved to become something completely different from the simple, stripped-back pages it was in its conception.“And in that evolution, it has become something that is quietly harming our children. A harm that, due to the inaction of previous Tory governments, we are allowing to happen.”Explore more on these topicsSocial media banSocial media bansYoung peopleInternet safetyKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

His killing came just two weeks after an immigration official shot and killed Renee Good and 10 days after the shooting of Julio C Sosa-Celis.On Monday, Minnesota’s bureau of criminal apprehension (BCA), a state-level criminal investigative law enforcement agency, said the FBI had formally notified it that it would not share any information or evidence related to Pretti’s shooting.ICE-free zones and blocked liquor licenses: US cities fight back against immigration raidsRead moreThe Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, has demanded an “impartial” investigation into the shootings inMinneapolis.“Trump’s left hand cannot investigate his right hand,” hesaidon Monday in response to the FBI’s refusal to share evidence. “The families of the deceased deserve better.”The BCA’s superintendent also expressed frustration.“While this lack of cooperation is concerning and unprecedented, the BCA is committed to thorough, independent and transparent investigations of these incidents, even if hampered by a lack of access to key information and evidence,”addedDrew Evans.He added that the agency remained committed to a joint investigation and said it would “continue to pursue all legal avenues to gain access to relevant information and evidence”.TheFBIdid not immediately respond to a request for comment.The agency has also previously refused to share any information related to the shootings of Good or Sosa-Celis, a lack of cooperation that led the BCA to stop its investigation into Good’s killing.“As we’ve previously said, full access to evidence, witnesses and information is necessary to meet the investigative standard that Minnesota law and the public demands; without it, we cannot do so,” the BCAsaidback in January, after the FBI boxed it out of the investigation.The Trump administration in December deployed federal officials to the Minneapolis area for an aggressive roundup of immigrants dubbed “Operation Metro Surge” that has seen a series of violent incidents as masked officials arrest people they claim to suspect lack proper residency documentation.Democrats and Republicans have both called on independent investigations into the Minneapolis shootings.Pretti, a nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs, was observing immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis when he was killed. Good was similarly an observer in Minneapolis, who was shot in her car by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer. Homeland security officials initially accused Good, 37, of “weaponizing” her vehicle, but local officials have disputed those claims.Both Pretti and Good were US citizens and video footage of their shootings has circulated widely, leading to mass protests.Sosa-Celis was shot by an ICE official in the leg last month. Trump administration officials initially claimed Sosa-Celis and two other men had “ambushed” the ICE officer who then “fired a defensive shot to defend his life”. But last week two ICE officials wereplaced on leavewhile they are investigated for allegedly lying under oath about the interaction.Explore more on these topicsMinnesota ICE shootingsFBIUS immigrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinneapolisMinnesotaUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The three defendants cannot be legally named because of their ages.The court heard that the three teenagers exchanged messages with Cashford using the alias Sienna after he had met the 16-year-old girl at an amusement arcade and given her a business card with a fake name.Messages show that the man claimed to be 30, asked the girl if she liked champagne and said he wanted to kiss her.The teenagers arranged to meet him at the seafront in Leysdown-on-Sea at about 7pm, the court was told, before following him as he walked along the promenade with the girl. The teenagers then chased him and hit him with rocks and a bottle.He was found dead face down in the mud. A postmortem examination found injuries to his face and head, bruises on his limbs and body, and fractured ribs that had punctured his lung.The girl filmed the boys chasing the victim while shouting “fucking paedophile, I’m fucking 16, get him”. After he was arrested, the 16-year-old boy shared footage of the attack with three people, the trial heard, with the caption “fucked pedo up lol”.During his evidence, the older boy was asked if, in the immediate aftermath – before they were arrested or discovered Cashford had died – he had thought he had “done the right thing” by attacking him. The boy replied: “Yeah, kind of, yeah.”When asked why, he said: “Because I feel like the police wouldn’t have done anything.”Danny Robinson KC, defending the girl, told the jury that texting Cashford started as a “big laugh” and may have turned “into a desire to expose him as someone who should be named and shamed”.The attack was not the product of an “organised plan to kill or cause anyone really serious harm”, he said, but instead “a childish escapade that got out of hand very quickly with tragic consequences”.The girl and the younger male defendant told the court there was never a plan to attack Cashford.Natalie Smith, a senior prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “This was a carefully pre-planned deliberate and violent attack on someone who was not expecting it and who could not defend himself. He was first hit from behind with a bottle and despite his best attempts to flee, he was relentlessly pursued and attacked, even when witnesses reported he was lying on the ground.“Their joint actions on that fateful evening led to Alexander Cashford’s death. His family now at least have the comfort of knowing that those responsible have been brought to justice.”The three teenagers are expected to be sentenced in April.Explore more on these topicsCrimeKentnewsShareReuse this content"

Everything he’s touched turns to garbage. His state has gone to hell, and his environmental work is a disaster.”In an intervention that is likely to be clocked by British government officials wary of potential new landmines in the UK’s relationship with the White House, Trump went on to say it was “inappropriate” for Newsom to strike such agreements and “inappropriate for them [the UK] to be dealing with him”.Newsom, one of the loudest domestic opponents of the US president on issues ranging from ICE deportation raids to the climate crisis, signed a memorandum of understanding in London with the UK’s energy secretary,Ed Miliband.Their agreement is aimed at deepening existing cooperation between the UK and California and creates a new framework to scale up clean energy technologies and enhance ties between businesses and researchers in Britain and the US state, which is in effect the world’sfourth largestglobal economy.The UK andCaliforniawill also share practical expertise on protecting biodiversity and building resilience amid extreme weather, Miliband’s department announced on Monday.Miliband said: “Strong international partnerships like today’s announcement with the state of California strengthen opportunities for UK businesses and secure investment for our country.”The signing follows their meeting in New York in September. On Monday in London, Newsom and Miliband also discussed AI and the implications for energy, and lessons from California’s wildfires – over which Trump and Newsom have clashed, the US president blaming them on the state’s management of fires.A source close to Miliband said: “It was a productive meeting based on the huge clean energy jobs and investment opportunities that the UK and California can bring to one another.”Newsom was in London just after attending the Munich Security Conference, where he said: “Donald Trump’s administration is temporary. California’s commitment is not.”The governor also used his visit to Europe to continue cultivating European leaders who have been notably outspoken in their opposition to policies pursued by the Trump administration.Last week he met Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, who was quick tojoin Latin American countriesin condemning the recent US military intervention in Venezuela, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who used an appearance in Munich tocriticise Trump’s reorientation of US foreign policy.Both Newsom and Miliband are bete noires for the new populist right. Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform UK party, said on Monday that he believed Miliband was the most likely candidate to take over from Keir Starmer if the latter is forced out in the event of a disastrous Labour party performance in upcoming local elections. Farage said Labour would then “shift to the left”.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyEd MilibandGavin NewsomDonald TrumpCaliforniaEnergy industryEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

The era of mass abundance, as supplied by unfettered free trade and global markets – “neoliberalism” – is over. We live in a new world of strategic competition between states over scarce but essential resources, with shocks to supplies from human activity and natural disasters an ever-present risk.This means recalibrating how we think about our economy: the new economic fundamentals today are resource constraints and climate and nature crises, and these, rather than human activity, will increasingly shape the world we inhabit. Flows of finance and stocks of wealth will matter less than stocks and flows of real material resources.There are two drivers of this shift. The first is the surge in demand for electricity across the globe. After a decade and more in which electricity demand in the developed world was stagnant or even falling, the last few years have seen an extraordinary resurgence in rich-world electricity demand – matching the continuing industrialisation and consumer booms of the fast-growing global south countries. The electrification of transport, and thedatacentre build-out powering artificial intelligence, along with continued strong demand for industrial production, are all at the cutting edge of shaping what the International Energy Agency calls a new “Age of Electricity”.For the first time since the Industrial Revolution, demand for coal, the filthiest of fossil fuels, is set to peak and then decline. “Peak coal” is being brought about by massive investments in renewable energy across the globe, led by China, which has seen renewable electricity overtake coal-generated for the first time. Even with rising demand, the IEA forecasts a cleaner future global electricity system. The transition is real – whatever Vance or Donald Trump may wish for.But this transition, the product of deliberate choice by governments and investors, is only half the story. The other half is being forced on us by the Earth’s changing climate. As temperatures rise,with last year yet again one of the warmest on record, so, too, has demand for airconditioning. This is adding major strains to electricity systems: at the height of the 2023 heatwave, factories in Sichuan province, China, were shuttered by its regional governmentto preserve scarce electricity supplies for a sweltering population running their aircon units at full-tilt.In India,electricity demand surged 9% during 2024’s heatwaves, forcing the country to lean more heavily into coal and gas generation – directly threatening progress on reducing emissions in a terrible example of climate blowback.And that electric surge is reshaping the demand for raw materials. Below the Age of Electricity is an Age of Copper – and graphite, lithium, cobalt; neodymium for magnets; yttrium for smartphone screens; scandium, europium, tantalum … A kaleidoscope of rare earths and critical minerals that make the transition possible, but whose supplies across the world are limited, and increasingly jealously guarded.If, for example, you want to build electric vehicles on a massive scale, you need batteries. And batteries, with current technologies, need lithium. World Bank projections suggest that global production of lithium must rise by 450% by 2050 to match projected demand. This is creating a bonanza for countries in the “Lithium Triangle” of Chile, Argentina and Bolivia,where 75% of known global reserves are found.Electrical goods also need wiring. Demand for copper is already surging – but usable supply is lagging behind.Copper prices surged 20% over 2025 to all-time highs, as demand raced ahead of supply, leaving a “copper deficit” of 200,000 tonnes. This imbalance is set to worsen.S&P Global forecast a 10 million tonne “copper deficit” globally by 2040.It is decades of patient investment and deliberate policy that has led to China being in the dominant position across essential mineral supply chains.Chinese companies control more than 50% of the globe’s refined copper production, with four of the world’s largest smelters located inside the country. Chile, which has the world’s largest reserves of the metal,produces around a quarter of the world’s unrefined copper, andabout three-quarters of this is sold to China. Hefty investments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo areprojected to give Chinese firms control of 46% of the world’s cobalt supply by the end of this decade. China is thedominant supplier of 19 out of 20 critical minerals surveyed by the International Energy Agency, commanding 90% of global refining capacity in some cases.It is this, above all else, that is concentrating minds in Washington. The pressure of competition for scarce but essential resources is forcing the US to ape its geopolitical rival. State ownership has become fashionable in the land of free enterprise: the US took equity stakes in five mining and refining companies last summer,concentrated in critical minerals, and isarranging the government-backed buyout of 40% of Glencore’s cobalt-copper mines in DRC. Trump’s animosity to renewables isn’t only prejudice: the drive to “drill, baby, drill” at home, or the seizure of oil in Venezuela, is the self-interested US response to the creation of a Chinese “electrostate”.But control of production is only part of the response. Control of existing stocks also matter, especially where there are real threats to fresh supplies. Leaks from China’s National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration last year detailed plans for the bureau, which oversees the country’s reserves of key commodities, from oil to pork bellies, to buy “cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium” and other metals. Total amounts bought, and current reserves held, are confidential, but estimates suggest that China’s stockpiles of industrial metals have ramped up significantly over years, and now come toseveral million metric tonnes in total. Stockpiles of non-ferrous metals were boosted after the pandemic to take advantage of a price slump,including a record purchase of 15,000 tonnes of cobalt, essential for electronics, while significant purchases over the last 12 months almost certainly contributed to rising global prices.Japan and South Korea both maintain similarrobustofficial metal stockpiles although on a smaller scale.Resource-poor Japan established its rare metal stockpiling system as far back as 1983, but it was China’s slashing of its own rare exports by 40% in 2010, provoking a price spike and shortages, that drove a step-change in national strategy. Dependent for more than 90% of its rare-earth imports from China, Japan both invested heavily in exploration and refining for new sources, and rapidly built up its own stockpiles.Its 2020 critical minerals strategy targets 60 days’ supply for most metals, while high-risk materials, such as those sourced from politically unstable countries, targets 180 days.India, which has long maintained wheat and rice reserves,approved plans in January 2025 to establish its own strategic reserve as part of a national critical minerals mission. Australia announced its own version in January this year, focused initially on antimony, gallium andrare-earth metals.The European Union is urging member states to develop coordinated stockpiles, as “rising geopolitical tensions, the mounting impacts of climate change, environmental degradation, and hybrid and cyber-threats” imperil the bloc’s supplies.When the US announces, as it did last week, that it will be investing $12bn (£9bn) in building a “strategic minerals reserve”,with the first depot at Hawthorne army base, Nevada, it is responding to the same logic. When it signs reams of critical mineral deals with other countries to create Vance’s “trading bloc”, it is scrabbling around for security in a world where championing free trade no longer hands it an automatic advantage.Nor are the threats to supplies only from other states. The natural world is a growing source of instability. Summer 2024 was one dramatic version of this when Spruce Pine, a mining town of 2,000 in North Carolina that also happens to be the world’s primary source of ultra-high quality quartz for semiconductor production,was battered by Storm Helene, closing its mines. For a few days, the world’s silicon chip production hung in the balance.PwC estimates that 70% of the world’s production of copper, cobalt and lithium will be at riskof drought over the next few decades;already, water-intensive copper mining and refining operations in Chile have been hit by the country’s mega-drought.The rush to hoard precious metals is not the action of states secure in the knowledge that a vast, globalised market will always be ready to supply whatever is needed. This is what states do when they realise resource pressures are real – and other states have an incentive to carve them out. It’s a world of state versus state competition, on behalf of their national businesses. One tonne of copper stockpiled in Nevada is a tonne that can’t be used in Shenzhen, and vice versa. This is the new, zero-sum logic of the global shortage economy.James Meadway is the host of theMacrodose podcastExplore more on these topicsCritical mineralsMiningCommoditiesanalysisShareReuse this content"

Times are critical and every drop now counts.”It was, she told the Guardian, the Mediterranean island’s worst drought in living memory with dam inflows at their lowest since 1901, when hydrological records first begun. Vast tracts of land across the country have been baked dry, with prime forest areas desiccated and dying fast.As other parts of Europe have this winter been lashed by rain, the sight of the church of St Nicholas in the Kouris reservoir, where water levels are reported to have dropped to just 12.2% of capacity, offered further proof of the worsening crisis.View image in fullscreenSt Nicholas church in the Kouris reservoir, August 2025.Photograph: Yiannis Kourtoglou/ReutersIf the reservoir was full, the monument would be submerged. Its appearance in what is by far the largest of a 110-strong reservoir network has demonstrated the scale of the emergency.Waterreserves in February stand at 13.7% of total storage capacity compared with 26% this time last year, a figure officials were then calling dire.And the situation could get a lot worse in the EU member state with the highest water stress levels. Temperatures in the region are rising 20% faster than the global average in the climate crisis, according to the Mediterranean Growth Initiative, a data analysisplatform. “This accelerated warming is putting severe pressure on freshwater resources, which are rapidly running dry,” it says.Soaring demand has intensified the island’s plight: annual rainfall has dropped an estimated 15% since 1901 while water needs have jumped 300% due to population growth and tourism. Three million tourists – nearly three times the resident population ofCyprus– visit the war-split country’s internationally recognised south each year.Tofa said a public awareness campaign would be rolled out this month with the aim of saving water. “The mean per capita consumption of water in Europe is 120 litres per person per day, but in some areas of Cyprus, being that much hotter, we have mean per capita consumption of 500 litres per day,” she said.“We’re preparing guidelines, a campaign, that will show people how much water should be used in household activities, like taking a shower, so that consumption can be kept to around 140 litres per person per day.”The drive will supplement other measures such as wastewater reuse and fixing water leakages, prevalent in up to 40% of local networks. Households will also receive financial support to invest in water-saving tap appliances.View image in fullscreenThe Kouris dam in September 2025, as Cyprus was experiencing a water shortage after record temperatures and no rain.Photograph: Athanasios Gioumpasis/Getty ImagesThe latest emergency package is the sixth to be announced. Cyprus has made water scarcity a priority of itsEU presidencyand allocated €200m to improving infrastructure, with the government scrambling to install desalination plants to meet drinking water needs.Two portable desalination units were donated last year by the United Arab Emirates. “The plan is to have 14 units in operation, most by the end of 2026,” said Tofa. “Working 24/7 we installed two in a matter of months last year.”But criticism is also mounting. “The right measures were not taken at the right time,” said Charalampos Theopemptou, an MP for the Movement of Ecologists – Citizens’ Cooperation party and the chair of the environment committee in the Cypriot parliament. “Twenty years ago when scientists were predicting temperatures in Nicosia being on a par with Cairo by 2030 and Bahrain by 2045, we all knew what was coming.”Desalination plants were not only costly but risky, he said. “They need a lot of energy and pose a danger to marine life if saline waters returned to the sea are not properly dispersed. We should have been finding ways, much earlier, to reduce water demand. It’s a disgrace, for example, that public spaces are still covered by grass and that we have so many swimming pools and golf courses.”Emblematic of the explosive situation are farmers who, hardest hit by the measures, have been ordered to reduce irrigation by 30%. “Farmers are besides themselves,” said Lambros Achilleos, a prominent unionist. “There’s a lot of angst, a lot of depression, with many being told to turn to new, less water-intensive crops. How do you tell farmers in their 50s and 60s who have families to feed to do that? There’s going to be a big problem in society and all because successive governments failed to take action that could have avoided all this and protected the environment long ago.”Fadi Comair, a professor of applied hydrology and water resource management at the Cyprus Institute in Nicosia said it was essential measures were taken now when a worst-case climate scenario could not be ruled out in the decades ahead.“Our research and modelling shows that, in the worst case, the increase in temperature will be 4.5 degrees by 2100, not 1.5 or 2 degrees … We’ll have a collapse of agriculture, drought will lead to the mass transfer of populations and we won’t be able to secure food,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCyprusDroughtWaterClimate crisisEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The storm triggered power outages, forced evacuations and damaged infrastructure, with further impacts likely on Monday as the system lingers for a time, before tracking southwards later.Its arrival came after days of widespread flooding in the Ōtorohanga district, where a man was found dead after his vehicle became submerged in flood waters. Some areas recorded more than 100mm of rain in 24 hours on Thursday, with Gisborne, Hawke’s Bay and the Bay of Plenty bearing the brunt of the deluge. The Tararua district and Wairarapa have also been experiencing heavy rain and strong winds from the storm, with 24-hour rainfall totals reaching more than 100mm locally, and wind speeds of about 80mph (130km/h) along coastal parts.The unusually persistent system developed when a cold front tracking east across the country late last week merged with a strengthening low-pressure system offshore, causing it to deepen. It then became trapped between two blocking high-pressure systems, stalling in place and subjecting the same communities to prolonged heavy rain.A humid air mass of tropical origin has fed additional moisture into the storm, further intensifying downpours. The low is now looping back on itself, a movement that continues to funnel rain bands over the already saturated area, compounding the risk of further flooding.Meanwhile, Storm Nils battered western Europe last week with what Météo-France described as “uncommon strength”, leaving two people dead in France and cutting power to about 900,000 homes. Flood alerts remained in place across south-west France, while red alerts were issued in northern Spain, including Galicia, Cantabria, and the Basque Country. Winds of up to 100mph lashed France’s Atlantic coast and the Alps, increasing avalanche danger in Alpine ski resorts. In the Italian Alps, unstable snowpack has been blamed for a number of deaths, including incidents in areas close to the Winter Olympics, though venues remained opened under close monitoring.In Portugal, a motorway bridge collapsed after the Mondego River burst its banks following weeks of relentless rain that left soils saturated and rivers swollen. Transport networks across Spain, France, and Portugal were heavily disrupted, with flight cancellations and rail delays amid flooding and high winds.The storm was intensified by a pronounced southward dip in the jet stream, steering a powerful Atlantic low into western Europe. As mild moisture-laden ocean air collided with colder continental air, the sharp temperature contrast fuelled the system. Rapid uplift generated intense rainfall at lower elevations and heavy snowfall over the Alps, where fresh snow and strong winds significantly increased avalanche risk.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerNew ZealandanalysisShareReuse this content"

That is lower than the 69.3% rate in Malawi and just above Afghanistan’s 62% rate. The World Health Organization advises a 95% rate.The outbreak in Enfield has reignited public and medical anxiety about unvaccinated children gettingmeasles, which can damage the brain and lungs and in some cases lead to meningitis, blindness or even death. Five “catch-up clinics” have been set up in local community centres to vaccinate children who got either one or no doses of MMR when it was offered to their parents.‘We almost lost you in the night’ - the life-threatening rise of measles in the UKRead moreNHS England has been accused of displaying “complacency” for its failure to halt arelentless declineover the last decade in the number of five-year-old children who are fully vaccinated, from 88.2% to 83.7%.Ministers are under pressure to let pharmacies start administeringMMRjabs to infants so that they can supplement the immunisation programmes that GP surgeries and schools already run.In England, GP staff, mainly practice nurses, deliver the first and second doses of MMR to children when they are 12 and 18 months old. Schools also play a key role by hosting catch-up events at which unvaccinated and under-vaccinated pupils can get covered.Ben Coleman, a Labour MP on the Commons health and social care select committee, said: “The long-term decline in uptake of MMR and growing number of very worrying measles outbreaks, like the one in Enfield just now, show that that system is clearly failing.“That means that children are at risk of hospitalisation and even of dying from measles. Given that undervaccination poses real risks to public health, it’s time for the NHS to accept thatGPsand schools on their own appear not to be able to provide the 95% coverage the WHO rightly insists on. Pharmacies are somewhere families often visit and they’re being wasted as a resource. We can’t afford complacency.”A childdied of measleslast summer in Alder Hey children’s hospital in Liverpool amid an increase in cases in the city.The Royal College of Paediatrics and ChildHealth, which represents specialist children’s doctors, said pharmacies should be handed a role in offering vaccines. Prof Steve Turner, its president, said the change would help “make it faster and easier for parents and guardians to get their children vaccinated”.He said: “With appropriate training and support, enabling pharmacists to deliver MMR vaccines could be particularly helpful for families who have missed routine appointments or need to catch up on their children’s vaccinations.”The National Pharmacy Association also backed the call. “The decade-long reduction in uptake of MMR vaccinations among children is a sign that the current system is simply not working and needs urgent reviewing by the NHS,” said Olivier Picard, the trade body’s chair. “We need to work across the whole health service to perform this vital public health role, not leave it to one small part of it.”Helen Bedford, a vaccination expert and professor of child health at University College London, said pharmacies could help supplement existing NHS efforts to ensure better MMR uptake, especially as some schools – includingsome faith schools– do not take part in catch-up campaigns.“That may be because of disruption to studies or that they don’t see it as a priority. Or it may be about [their] views about vaccination generally,” she said.Coleman said MPs on the health committee sensed “complacency” among NHS bosses over falling MMR take-up when they gave evidence last week about trends in vaccination.At the hearing, Dr Mary Ramsay, the UK Health Security Agency’s director of public health programmes, admitted under questioning by Coleman that opposition among GPs to pharmacies being paid to perform a role currently undertaken by family doctors made that change difficult.The MP asked: “GPs might be annoyed if pharmacies can do it?” Ramsay replied: “That is an element.”The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) did not indicate if pharmacies might start delivering MMR jabs. Superdrug has said it would start providing MMR jabs if asked.Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at Oxford University, said of the Enfield outbreak there was “a real risk of further spread both locally and in other parts of London”, since the virus could easily spread in communities where less than 95% of people were vaccinated, as is the case in many parts of London.“When ‘enough’ people have been infected, the outbreak will die down, only to return again later when more unvaccinated children are born and the number who are susceptible has re-accumulated; there will be another explosive outbreak,” he said.A spokesperson for the DHSC said: “It is vital for anyone not yet vaccinated against MMR to do so as soon as possible. Not only does this ensure that you are protected, but also those around you.“To improve uptake and provide earlier protection against measles, from January children can have their second dose of MMR sooner. We’ve also introduced chickenpox protection into the childhood programme with the MMRV vaccine.“Low vaccination rates leave communities vulnerable, and we are taking urgent action with partners across London to boost MMR uptake and safeguard children’s health.”The government launched a campaign on Monday encouraging parents to ensure their children were up to date with all their vaccinations. It said childhood immunisations prevent about 5,000 deaths and 228,000 hospitalisations each year in England alone.Explore more on these topicsMMRVaccines and immunisationNHSGPsHealthHealth policyLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The case had been due to be heard in court next week.The last-minute deal has paved the way for large-scale legal action across the sector, which lawyers estimate could cost universities millions, depending on the number of students involved in each claim.The legal action is being brought under consumer law, which states that where a consumer pays for a service but is provided with a different service of lower value, they may be entitled to compensation.Lawyers argue that students paid annual tuition fees for in-person teaching and full access to facilities, but Covid restrictions meant campuses were closed and courses moved online.Fees for online degree courses are typically 25-50% less than those for traditional in-person courses, and the students’ lawyers maintain their clients are owed “fair financial compensation”.Shimon Goldwater, partner at Asserson, which is representing students, said: “UK undergraduates at university during the pandemic borrowed money at ridiculous interest rates to fund courses which were ruined by online teaching and closed facilities.“Student Group Claim is helping students challenge universities to do what they should have done during Covid: pay students compensation for not providing them with the in-person teaching for which they paid.”Other universities facing legal action include Birmingham, Coventry, De Montfort, East Anglia, Leeds Beckett, London School of Economics and Political Science, Loughborough, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Southampton and York. More could follow if other students come forward before a September 2026 deadline.Georgia Johnson, 28, was doing a year-long postgraduate teaching degree when Covid hit. She said: “With teaching, you have to get into the classroom as soon as possible. I sat in a room learning how to teach over Zoom.”View image in fullscreenGeorgia Johnson says her teaching career was stalled by the pandemic’s effect on her postgraduate degree.Photograph: Georgia JohnsonThe experience affected her mental health and delayed her career. She added: “It was a massive setback. I had to take time out of university because it got too much. I definitely didn’t get what I should have got while I was there.”Commenting on the settlement, Dr Michael Spence, UCL president and provost, said: “We recognise that the Covid years were incredibly difficult for students. Covid-19 created disruption across society, and universities were no exception.“Throughout the pandemic we provided clear routes for students to seek redress, and many secured compensation through those established processes.“This resolution enables us to focus on our core mission of delivering world-leading research and education.”A spokesperson forUniversitiesUK, which represents 142 institutions, said universities, like other sectors, had followed government guidance to adapt to a fast-changing situation during the pandemic.They said: “During some periods of lockdown, universities were not permitted to offer in-person teaching as usual and instead they adjusted quickly and creatively to allow students to complete their degrees.”Explore more on these topicsUniversitiesStudentsHigher educationCoronavirusnewsShareReuse this content"

a British passportwhen boarding a plane, ferry or train to the UK, or attach a new document, a “certificate of entitlement”, which costs nearly £600, to their second passport.Campaigners say it will pose particular problems for some women in Greece and Spain who took out citizenship afterBrexitbecause of British rules requiring names to exactly match on the UK and second passports.In Greece, women are required to keep their maiden name after marriage to a Greek national, meaning those whose British passports use their husband’s name will fall foul of the name-match rule.UK private jet deportation flight cancelled after man swallows vape batteryRead moreIn Spain, Britons married to Spaniards carry two surnames on official ID, the maiden name of their mother and their father’s surname, while in the UK their British passport will only have one surname.“It is causing huge problems,” said Julia Cross, of the grassroots organisation British in Greece. “Many didn’t know they had to get a second passport but the requirement for name alignment on the two passports is discriminatory and only impacts women.” The body represents 20,000 Britons in Greece, and is part of the

are unable to change their name in their foreign issued documents, theHome Officewill exceptionally consider allowing them to use a different name in a Home Office issued document,” its guidance says.But campaigners said the new rules had not been communicated and were causing confusion and stress to affected women in Spain and Greece.Cross called on the government to urgently introduce a transition period of “at least three months” to communicate the new rules in a meaningful fashion and enable Britons abroad to make any necessary adjustments.“I’ve had one woman get in touch who says she feels like she has been ‘banned’ from entering her own country,” said Cross. “I have had another asking if we are now entering a Trumpian environment where they turn against their own citizens.”A

they allow anyone to board without the correct document.The UKgovernment’s guidancewarns with a black exclamation mark: “You may not be able to board your transport to the UK without a valid document” after 25 February.Stefanie, a British woman living in Spain for 25 years who naturalised after Brexit, pointed out another problem.UK migration could be negative this year – how will that hit the economy?Read moreSpain does not recognise dual nationals unless they are born to one Spanish and one foreign parent, and naturalisation candidates are required to “tick” a box renouncing their other nationality as part of the naturalisation process.But, Stefanie said, many “secretly still hold British passports” but fear if they suddenly produce that at the airport, they could risk losing their Spanish passport because it will expose the fact they have not renounced their British citizenship.She said: “Even if I could fly out on the Spanish and show the airline I possess a British passport, I was told if the names don’t align, the airline may refuse boarding, which is ridiculous, because British only have one surname and Spanish two.”The change in rules has come as part of a wider effort to improve immigration data gathering at the border.From 25 February foreign nationals will have to apply for an “electronic travel authorisation” (ETA) for £16 to enter the country, but the government has said dual nationals cannot use this on their second passport.Irish passport holders are exempt from the rule.Gabrielle Mordy, in Australia, who has dual nationality through her father told the Guardian how she had travelled without issue on her Australian passport for years. But she onlyheard about the rulechange in January and pointed out that getting a certificate of entitlement can take up to eight weeks, so is not a contingency for anyone travelling in the next two months.One woman living in Germany said: “They are treating tourists better than their own citizens. Why can’t we just have an ETA? Why do we have fork out nearly £600 if we can’t get a passport. For a family travelling at Easter that is a lot of money.”Some names have been changed.Explore more on these topicsBrexitEuropeWomenImmigration and asylumHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Calling them a “ticking time bomb”, relief groups said the women and children could not just be left to rot in squalid desert camps indefinitely, because eventually they would come home.Despite the warnings, most states ignored the problem, refusing to repatriate their citizens. At least 8,000 women and children from more than 40 countries have been stranded in the camps of north-eastSyriasince 2019.This week,they started to come home. Belgian authorities reported a woman charged in absentia for IS membership had made her way from Turkey to Belgium. An Albanian woman, kidnapped as a child by her father and taken to Syria, managed to smuggle herself to Turkey, where she requested travel documents.Australian women and children sent back to Syrian detention camp after initial releaseRead moreThousands more non-Syrian women and children are distributed across the country, their whereabouts mostly unknown. Most of them were residents of al-Hawl camp, once the world’s largest prison camp, which housed about 25,000 family members of suspected IS fighters, 6,000 of whom were foreigners.Security analysts have said the camp became a hotbed for extremist ideology, and that by keeping IS-affiliated women and children in such close quarters, a new generation of IS members was being raised. Humanitarians raised the alarm about what they called life-threatening living conditions, under which residents died of asphyxiation each winter as they tried to escape the cold by burning coal in their tents.SinceDamascus took over al-Hawlas part of its wresting of territory from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) last month, the camp has slowly emptied. Smugglers, foreign fighters and family members have come to the camp each night to retrieve residents, most of whom were taken to Idlib, a province in north-west Syria where many former Islamist fighters live.Frustrated by their governments’ lack of action, family members have begun to organise the return of people formerly held in detention facilities. The Belgian and Albanian women smuggled themselves out of Syria into Turkey without the coordination of their governments.2:33The 'ticking-bomb' Syrian prisons filled with IS suspects – video explainerOn Monday, relatives of 34 Australian women and childrenorganised a convoy of minibusesfrom al-Roj camp in north-east Syria, where the SDF is holding more than 2,000 families of suspected IS fighters. They set off for Damascus, seemingly without the backing of Canberra, with the aim of boarding flights back to Australia.They were turned back en route, apparently for not coordinating with Damascus in advance, but Syrian officials say their return has only been briefly delayed.Damascus, unlike the SDF, seem unwilling to play prison warden in perpetuity. A humanitarian who met interior ministry officials shortly before Damascus took over al-Hawl last month said they approached the camp as a child protection rather than a security issue.A new camp Damascus has set up to house al-Hawl residents who do not want to leave has wifi and an open door – a far cry from the Humvees with mounted machine guns the SDF maintained outside al-Hawl’s barbed-wire fences for years.‘Open the gates’: riots, fires and escape attempts as Syrian army takes over IS campRead moreGovernments seem to have lost their chance to manage the repatriation of their citizens – some of whom are said to be affiliated to IS – and instead now face a disorganised, chaotic process of returns which experts say place citizens and countries in danger.The prospect of thousands of women and children roaming Syria opens the door to renewed recruitment into extremist organisations such as IS, or trafficking and exploitation. A foreign woman from a country who escaped al-Hawl to Idlib last year was promptly kidnapped and had to be freed via ransom. Her family have not heard from her since.Many of the women have no desire to stay in Syria after years of horrific detention, asexplained by more than a dozen during a recent Guardian visit to al-Hawl, and will seek to return to their home countries.Dealing with their repatriation will be much more of a challenge for home governments now than it was before, when the families were concentrated in camps.Pressure is growing to release those women and children still held in al-Roj, where mostly European and Russian women are housed. That is where Shamima Begum, the UK-born woman who traveled to Syria at the age of 15 after chatting to a man there, lives.Governments such as the UK’s have refused for years to repatriate their citizens from al-Roj and other camps, preferring to kick the can down the road, and in Begum’s case strip her of her citizenship. Over the last month however, the room for further delay seems to be quickly narrowing.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIslamic StateMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

At the end of the last act, the year’s chosen victim, a far-right party functionary, delivers a 15-minute monologue laying out a nightmarish extremist agenda.As the actor Ole Lagerpusch launched into the incendiary speech, the audience became increasingly agitated, the theatre spokesperson Alexander Kruse said. At first, people began whistling and heckling, insulting Lagerpusch and urging him to stop. An orange was thrown at the actor, narrowly missing him.Kruse said some of the audience then got out of their seats. “Furthermore, two spectators mounted the stage, apparently with the intention of dragging [the] actor off the stage, which was prevented,” he said, calling the assault “completely unacceptable”.Martin Krumbholz of the culture website Nachtkritik.de, who was at the Bochum Schauspielhaus to review the play, said Lagerpuschpersevered despite the hostile reactionand managed to deliver his chilling last line: “The future belongs to us.”View image in fullscreenTwo spectators mounted the stage as Ole Lagerpusch’s far-right character delivered a monologue.Photograph: Armin SmailovicThe play’s acclaimed Slovenian director, Mateja Koležnik, said by telephone from Ljubljana that she was “incredibly proud” of Lagerpusch and denounced the “stupidity” and brutality of the spectators’ attack. “For me it was quite a shock – we did expect people talking back, even shouting back, because, of course, the last monologue is a provocation,” she said.She said Lagerpusch, who she described as “traumatised”, was so effective in the role because he was softly spoken, even affable, in conveying his hateful, divisive message. “[But] I was astonished by the stupidity, really. I never ever thought – nobody did – that somebody from the audience would jump on stage and try to hit the actor … I would expect this from the people we are voting against, but not from the people who should be on our side.”Koležnik said her intention with the production had not been to make “liberal, petit bourgeois society inEuropefeel good” around a consensus of condemning intolerance, but to leave them scared. “The next wave of fascism, there will not be monsters. There will be normal, nice people,” she said.The critic Christoph Ohrem of the regional public broadcaster WDR attended the premiere and releaseda brief audio recordingof the tumult, which he said recalled something from the age of Shakespeare.He noted Rodrigues’s piece had often triggered intense responses from audiences and concluded it was a “good play” for taking spectators out of their comfort zone. “It’s truly astonishing that a play can still elicit such reactions in 2026,” he said. Rodrigues has said heintended to cause a stirwith the play.In his review, Krumbholz placed the blame for the uproar on spectators. “Parts of the Bochum audience, which one would have thought to be among the most theatre-savvy in the country, are apparently too stupid, to put it bluntly, to distinguish between fiction and reality,” he said.People expressed support for the theatre in Bochum onits Instagram page, with one commenter noting that a subsequent performance withstepped-up security measures, and after an appeal for calm by the deputy director Angela Obst, had gone off without incident.Another spectator said of Saturday’s debacle that she had been “shocked how disrespectful some people can be in the theatre” when “the actor was just doing his job”.A third called it “scary” when “supposedly anti-fascist theatregoers storm the stage and attack the actors. This is basically a fascist attitude towards art and theatre and, in my opinion, should never happen.”Rodrigues’s play has won several awards including best foreign performance at Italy’s Ubu awards and the equivalent prize from the French Critics’ Union.Explore more on these topicsGermanyTheatreEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

Probably not now.”Halsey said he was not angry about the prospect of getting no return on his investment because he had made lasting friends at BrewDog events and received freebies with monetary value, such as an all-expenses-paid trip to the annual meeting inAberdeen.View image in fullscreenDogTap Ellon, BrewDog’s onsite tap room in Aberdeenshire.Photograph: Kay Roxby/AlamySome investors in the company, posting on the Equity for Punks forum, were less sanguine.“Not surprised at all, but would have been nice to have been informed of it by management before reading it in the news,” one user said, after Sky News first reported the plan.“But then again, that’s just the BrewDog way nowadays. More evidence that the EFPs [exchange of futures for physical investors], who shelled out cash to get them in this position, mean less than fuck all to the company.”Another said: “Well at least I got £2.34 off an order once. Not a bad return for £500.”Equity punks were entitled to benefits such as discounts in bars and on web orders, as well as invitations to the group’s AGMs, referred to as “annual general mayhem” by the company, in Aberdeen.But they are not expected to make a return on their investment.View image in fullscreenJames Watt, co-founder, at BrewDog in Ellon. He is rumoured to have made £50m from the TSG investment.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianTSG’s £213m purchase of a 22.3% stake in 2017 allowed some small investors to cash out at a profit but also granted the private equity group preferential terms that entitle it to a sizeable return on its equity investment.Analysts have previously estimated that it can claim £800m from any sale.In the last Equity for Punks funding round, in 2021, £30m shares were sold at £25.15 each, implying a valuation of about £2bn before a rumoured stock market float.At a private auction on the platform Asset Match in September 2022, shares were sold for £6.50 each, implying a valuation of less than £520m. If the sale price of the company is less than TSG’s claim on the proceeds of any deal, that would leave nothing for small investors.The fall from grace has been evidenced by five years of consecutive losses and a first ever fall in sales last year, which prompted speculation that“peak BrewDog” was already in the past.The brand’s reputation for apunk ethos has also evaporatedin the face of public allegations about its treatment of staff, including a public letter complaining of a“toxic” workplace environmentunder the co-founder James Watt.While Watt apologised for some of his conduct, he alsohired private investigatorsto gather intelligence on people he said had maligned him, including by taking part ina BBC documentary.Wattstepped down in 2024and has since focused on new ventures, including Social Tip, which pays people to make social media posts about brands.He has also maintained a vocal social media presence, criticising taxes on the wealthy, speculating that he mightdelay his marriageto the reality TV star Georgia Toffolo to maximise tax relief, and attending Nigel Farage’s birthday party.Watt, who is rumoured to have made £50m from the TSG investment, still holds a stake in the company and is now rumoured to be corralling support from financial backers to buy back part or all of the business.One forum user posted: “James can buy the company when he pays us all back the money we wasted on useless ‘shares’.”Explore more on these topicsBrewDogPrivate equityFood & drink industryAberdeenInvestingScotlandBeerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The projects ultimately ran hundreds of millions of pounds over budget.Steve Smart, a director at the FCA, said: “Carillion’s failure was significant. Jobs were lost, public sector projects put at risk and investors, who trusted the company to give them accurate information, suffered large scale losses. That’s why the FCA worked diligently to hold the company and its senior leaders to account.”Howson challenged the fine, which wasfirst announced at a provisional sum of £397,800 in 2022, but withdrew his appeal before the court hearing.The fine against Howson followspenalties against two other former executives, Richard Adam and Zafar Khan, last month. The FCA fined them £232,800 and £138,900 respectively, after both men also dropped their appeals against the watchdog’s findings.Only months before its collapse, Carillion shocked investors by announcing a £845m writedown owing to problems in its construction projects. The company’s former chair,Philip Green, was working towards an “upbeat announcement” to investorsfive days before it announced the charge, board minutes showed, and the FCA found the company’s previous trading update had given no indication that such a step was necessary.In 2023, the accounting groupKPMG was fined £21m by the accountancy regulatorfor “exceptional” failures in its audits of Carillion between 2013 and 2017.Howson declined to comment on the fine.Explore more on these topicsCarillionConstruction industrynewsShareReuse this content"

In an abrupt reversal of his long-stated plans,Marsis suddenly on the back burner. And getting US astronauts back on the lunar surface before the end of Donald Trump’s second term of office in three years’ time is the priority now, as well as keeping them there.“For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” Musk wrote Sundayon X, the social media platform he also owns.“The mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to the stars. SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster.”The post contained no mention of Trump, his on-again, off-again friend and political ally from Musk’schaotic tenureas head of the president’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) last year that upended numerous federal agencies without delivering the $2tn in savings he promised.But it is hard to separate Musk’s volte-face with the US president’s vainglorious quest, delivered in a Decemberexecutive ordertitled Ensuring American Space Supremacy, to see the Stars and Stripes planted on the moon during his presidency.Such an accomplishment would be, to phrase it mildly, a huge ask. Budget overruns and technical problems have significantly delayed Nasa’s Artemis program, and theArtemis 3moon landing, the first since the final Apollo mission in 1972, has been pushed back several times from its original target of 2024 to “by 2028”.Musk’s maneuver allows his company to direct more immediate resources to that mission, for which SpaceX is contracted to supply the human landing system (HLS) component.Even so, it has its work cut out.A leaked internal document,reported by Politicoin November, revealed a timeline at odds with that of Nasa, predicting a “boots on the moon” mission no earlier than September 2028, and only then “if all goes well” with preparatory missions.Those missions include an in-orbit fuel transfer between vehicles, and an un-crewed moon landing sometime in 2027 using a SpaceX Starship rocket. Asspace.comnoted in November, despite a series of promising test flights during 2025, Starship has yet to complete a successful orbital test flight.“The launch is the easiest part of all of this. Getting things into space, that’s the easy part. Landing is a lot harder, particularly landing on a different celestial body,” Casey Dreier, director of space policy at the Planetary Society,told the Guardianlast month.Ultimately Nasa, now under the stewardship of the billionaire private astronautJared Isaacman, Musk’s friend and ally, is expected to ditch thetroublesomeand expensive space launch system (SLS) that will power the space agency’s next two Artemis missions. Artemis 2 is currently at its Cape Canaveral launchpad in Florida, awaiting liftoff with a crew that will travel around the moon, but not land, as early as next month.That will open the door to an even closer partnership with private space enterprise, and Musk is eyeing future contracts for its own reusable Starship fleet that he envisions eventually traveling between Earth, the moon and Mars.For many, that financial incentive alone might be evidence enough to explain his switch of attention to the moon. But the entrepreneur is also wary of losing ground to his biggest rival, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his burgeoning Blue Origin company.From being streets behind Musk, Blue Origin - which holds a $3.4bn Nasa contract to supply the lander for the Artemis 5 mission scheduled for 2030 – has made huge strides in recent months. It made a statement in November with the firstsuccessful test flightof its New Glenn deep-space rocket, and announced two weeks ago that it wassuspendingits program of suborbital tourist space flights to shift resources to its lunar ambitions.Eric Berger, a space expert and senior writer for Ars Technica, said Blue Origin was “the one company with the potential to seriously challenge SpaceX in spaceflight over the next decade”.Inan analysispublished this week questioning why Musk appeared to have given up on Mars, Berger wrote: “Blue Origin might land humans on the moon before Starship, a threat sources at Starbase [the company’s Texas headquarters] say SpaceX is beginning to take seriously.”Berger also noted Musk’s increasing obsession with artificial intelligence, exemplified by his $1.25tnmerger earlier this monthof SpaceX with xAI, which includes the Grok chatbot and X, the social media platform.“A major focus of Musk going forward will be to construct orbital datacenters to provide enormous computing resources for his vision of humanity’s online future,” he said.“By focusing on the moon, Musk is making a decision that benefits Nasa and the US. Because for all of Blue Origin’s promise with aslimmed-down lunar lander, Starship offers a promising avenue to return humans to the moon in the near term.”Explore more on these topicsThe moonMarsSpaceElon MuskanalysisShareReuse this content"

In 2021, KPMG Australia wasfinedA$615,000 over “widespread” misconduct, after it was found that more than 1,100 partners had been involved in “improper answer-sharing” on tests designed to assess skill and integrity.UK accounting body to halt remote exams amid AI cheatingRead moreBut AI tools have introduced new possibilities for rule-breaking. InDecember, the UK’s largest accounting body, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), said it would require accounting students to take exams in person, because otherwise it was too difficult to stop AI cheating.Helen Brand, the chief executive of the ACCA, said at the time that AI tools had led to a “tipping point” as the use of them was outpacing safeguards against cheating put in place by the association.Firms such as KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers have also beenmandatingtheirstaffto use AI at work, reportedly in an effort to boost profits and cut costs.KPMG partners will reportedly be assessed on their ability to use AI tools during their 2026 performancereviews, with the firm’s global AI workforce lead, Niale Cleobury, saying: “We all have a responsibility to be bringing AI to all of our work.”Some commenters on LinkedIn noted the irony in using AI to cheat in AI training. KPMG is “fighting AI adoption instead of redesigning how they train people. This is a not a cheating problem – if we look at the new world order. This is a training problem,”wroteIwo Szapar, the creator of a platform that ranks organisations’ “AI maturity”.KPMG said it had adopted measures to identify the use of AI by its staff and would keep track of how many of its workers misused the technology.Andrew Yates, the chief executive of KPMG Australia, said: “Like most organisations, we have been grappling with the role and use of AI as it relates to internal training and testing. It’s a very hard thing to get on top of given how quickly society has embraced it.“Given the everyday use of these tools, some people breach our policy. We take it seriously when they do. We are also looking at ways to strengthen our approach in the current self-reporting regime.”Explore more on these topicsKPMGAccountancyAI (artificial intelligence)newsShareReuse this content"

It is not to the challenging and beloved gothic novel of emotional repression and inheritance; as with many other cinematic adaptations, Fennell dispenses with the unruly latter half of the book, along with most of its conventions. In Fennell’s emphatically maximalist vision – she has explained that the quotation marks in the film’s marketing are a note of humility, to her singular and limited interpretation – the tortuously connected Cathy (Margot Robbie) and Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi) swoon about the Yorkshire moors in extravagant, anachronistic formalwear, flagrantly unbound by period decorum.Wuthering Heights review – too hot, too greedy adaptation guarantees bad dreams in the nightRead moreOver three features, the English writer-director has demonstrated a penchant for sticky visuals; arguably the most-discussed scene from 2023’s Saltburn, her discourse-driving sophomore feature, involved the licking of cummy bathwater from the drain. Wuthering Heights is not to be controversially out-soaked. In closeup, sweat beads and drips down a spine; snail slime indolently streaks a window; freshly poured pig blood mucks Cathy’s dress. Desire, less suggested than enforced, stains everything. Early in the film, just after the abrupt ageing of Cathy and Heathcliff from boundless children (played by Charlotte Mellington and Adolescence’s Owen Cooper) to unspecific adults, Elordi’s brooding, beastly Heathcliff catches Robbie’s blonde Cathy, furiously horny after a bit of light voyeurism, pleasuring herself against the windswept rocks. She tries to hide her hand in her dress; he picks her up by the bodice strings, and licks her fingers clean.Erotic mileage for this will vary, as it does with any Fennell project; the director’s compulsion to induce shock by whatever loud, luxe means necessary has proven reliably divisive, though her bankable notoriety seems perhaps more polarizing than her actual work, which undeniably speaks to our vibes-forward, hit-seeking visual culture. I met this brazen play for the lizard brain as I did much of the callowly shocking Saltburn, with part jolt, part admiration – in this sexless slop age, at least someone is trying! – and an eye roll. There is visual pleasure, of course, in seeing two beautiful people contort themselves into postures of florid desire, the titillation of fingers and mouths and skin.But this lustful vibe felt curiously muted and chilly, and not because of the persistent Yorkshire mist. We have only just met the adult pair, with no sense of their intervening years. Robbie, a mature actor in her mid-30s, plays Cathy, who is 15 on the page, as if she has just discovered sexual pleasure. Wide-eyed and petulant, naive and yet fully formed, she is an uncanny mix of woman and girl, without much history. Like, say, alife-size doll… and that’s before Cathy plays literal dollhouse in the ostentatious wealth afforded by her marriage (to Shazad Latif’s Mr Linton), a loveless, baroque fantasyland replete with lacquered floors and walls colored to her skin. Robbie’s agile performance, her sui generis emotions in extremis, cannot cover the flatness of the written character. Amid such exuberant excess, she pales.That’s par for the course for Fennell, whose lavish and genuinely prolific visual imagination has never extended to the realm of character. I was flummoxed by her 2020 debutPromising Young Woman, a noxious jawbreaker which coated a dimensionless black core of misogyny with a pastel sheen (and netted Fennell a best original screenplay Oscar); that film, born of pop #MeToo rage, squandered an excellent premise and performance from Carey Mulligan into a single annihilating, dead-ending obsession for rape revenge. I was both momentarily entranced and put off bySaltburn, which sacrificed any character coherence or muddled class commentary for moments of juvenile psychosexual shocks that felt tailor-made to provoke a puritan outrage cycle. In Wuthering Heights, Fennell makes no pretense of social commentary; this is, toquoteVulture’s Alison Willmore, a work of “smooth-brained sensuality” about two messy people who won’t quit each other.That makes for arguably Fennell’s dumbest and thus best movie, though it is no less frustrating. For lurking just beneath the film’s slippery, stylish surface is a familiar lack of interest in its female characters. Alternately haughty and horny, beseeching and cruel, Cathy is either one-dimensional victim or villain at will, a vessel of the film’s gaudy tableaus. Her longtime companion Nelly (Hong Chau) bears the brunt of her scorn. A fascinatingly unreliable narrator in the book, Fennell reduces Nelly, explained here as the bastard daughter of another landlord hired to serve Cathy, to merely conniving spectator, her motivations compressed to base jealousy and bitter resentment.Is Jacob Elordi really what Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights should look like? | Dave SchillingRead moreWorst of all is Linton’s sister Isabella (Alison Oliver), a simpering, daft creature fixated on dolls and ribbons. Oliver is by far the funniest part of the movie, but there’s a sinister shade to her infantile mannerisms and obsequious devotion to Heathcliff. (Fennell, in typical blunt fashion, literalizes the book’s dom-sub valence to their relationship with a dog collar.) Isabella epitomizes the film’s strikingly dim view of its women, who are rudderless, rash and, with the exception of Nelly, hopelessly entranced by Heathcliff. Upon learning of his marriage to Isabella, Cathy pouts. “He’s mine,” she petulantly cries – not because she loves him, but because she named him as a child.View image in fullscreenAlison Oliver in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Warner Bros. Ent. All Rights Reserved/PAThese are, indeed, childish characters, and not in definitionally petty way (though they are that, too). Literally child-ish, in that they embody the crude, totalizing emotions of adolescence. Perhaps Fennell is attempting to convey the extreme societal constrictions on 19th-century women; perhaps she is interested in how thwarted desire blunts our faculties, can turn even the sharpest of us into strange, strung-out creatures. But I detected, once again, Fennell’s uncanny and seemingly unknowing knack for pop culture titillation, for commercial if not cinematic benefit – namely, the persistentfixation with girlhood, identifying with and returning toprolonged adolescence. Wuthering Heights strains for adult passions and postures with the conviction of a teenager stuffing her mother’s bra.For all its aesthetic excess – and though I may not agree with Fennell’s vision, I will defend its intemperance – there’s a strange small-mindedness to this adaptation, a failure of romantic imagination. I am as susceptible as anyone to overwhelming loudness, for being so smacked in the face with sublime audiovisual stimulation that it turns my brain off. (Coincidentally, the best music by Charli xcx, who composed the film’s soaring, synth-y soundtrack, does this in spades, and I include the movie opener House in that.) But the problem with hinging a film on self-destructive eroticism is that it requires a self to destruct – the messy, confusing, contradictory substance of desire. Otherwise, it’s just dress-up.Explore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsEmerald FennellMargot RobbieRomance filmsEmily BrontëcommentShareReuse this content"

The last time the pair appeared together was 2001, when The Mummy Returns (itself an insipid sequel to 1999’s much better The Mummy) hit multiplexes. Since then we’ve had a spin-off (2002’s The Scorpion King, featuring an early turn from Dwayne Johnson) and a second sequel that didn’t feature Weisz, 2008’s forgettable The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.And then, of course, there was the ill-fated “Dark Universe”, forever immortalised bythat solemn publicity photographof Russell Crowe (Dr Jekyll), Javier Bardem (Frankenstein’s Monster), Tom Cruise and Johnny Depp (The Invisible Man) staring into the middle distance like an ageing goth supergroup. The plan was to launch an interconnected saga in which Jekyll would act as a sort of monster-movie Nick Fury, corralling Dracula, Frankenstein and assorted undead assets into a synergised Marvel-style cinematic ecosystem. Fortunately it rapidly fell apart: 2017’s Cruise-led The Mummy landed with all the grace of a cursed sarcophagus dropped down a lift shaft. And that, as far as the Dark Universe was concerned, was that. Universal pivoted to smaller films such as Leigh Whannell’s The Invisible Man, while Bardem’s Monster and Depp’s Invisible Man never materialised at all.View image in fullscreenAgeing goth band … the ‘Dark Universe’ stars, from left, Russell Crowe, Javier Bardem, Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp and Sofia Boutella.Photograph: Marco Grob/Unive/THA/ShutterstockNow it appears the studio has reverted to that pre-2010s era in which movies often featured a clear, linear story, sometimes with a beginning, middle and end. In the absence of any other clear plans for The Mummy, you can’t really blame it. Fraser is in the middle of a career resurgence off the back of Darren Aronofsky’s The Whale, and Weisz has never been away. If the original Fraser-Weisz-era Mummy filled a gap created by Steven Spielberg’s refusal to make more Indiana Jones movies, this belated sequel has the advantage of debuting when the latter series looks dead and buried after the lukewarm response to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.Is the era of cinematic universes as a whole now coming to an end? Sony’s Spider-Man-without-Spider-Man experiment has limped quietly away. The Flash felt less like a triumphant multiverse caper than DC’s continuity collapsing in on itself. And while Marvel Studios is hardly packing up the Infinity Stones just yet, there are persistent whispers that the next pair of Avengers films – Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars – may function as a convenient narrative reset.And yet the reality is that audiences don’t so much hate cinematic universes as feel disgruntled when studios announce entire multiversal macro-sagas before anyone has seen the credits roll on the first instalment. When Marvel brought out Iron Man in 2008, there were already plans to unite Tony Stark with Captain America and Thor in Avengers movies, but the studio made sure all these entries worked before trying to mash them together. The best part of two decades on, the studio is facing diminishing box office returns and (arguably) multiverse fatigue after trying too hard to turn casual viewers into reluctant archivists.View image in fullscreenA brisk, pulpy adventure … 1999’s The Mummy.Photograph: Album/AlamyPerhaps this is why the prospect of a new Mummy film feels faintly radical. No extended monster roll-call, no roadmap presentation disguised as narrative, no solemn announcement that Dr Jekyll will return in Tomb of the Shared Continuity. Just a brisk, pulpy adventure in which attractive people sprint towards danger, exchange flirtatious barbs and resolve the central problem. In 1999 this was simply called “a blockbuster”. In 2026 it may qualify as niche programming.And maybe that is the lesson beneath Universal’s strategic retreat. Audiences did not revolt against interconnected storytelling so much as grow weary of being conscripted into it. The connective tissue became the point. The scaffolding overshadowed the structure. What began as an occasional thrill – a cameo here, a crossover there – slowly mutated into homework. A Fraser-Weisz reunion, by contrast, promises something almost unfashionable: narrative closure. If it works, it will not be because it resurrects an old property, but because it resurrects the until-recently-unfashionable idea that a story can simply conclude.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekBrendan FraserRachel WeiszScience fiction and fantasy filmsUniversal PicturesHorror filmscommentShareReuse this content"

This Hindi gangland epic’s credentials are impeccable: director Vishal Bhardwaj previously wowed with textured, inventive variations on Macbeth (Maqbool, 2003), Othello (Omkara, 2006) and Hamlet (Haider, 2014). But rather than a straightforward modernisation of Romeo and Juliet, this latest revisits a grisly true-crime story ripped from Hussain Zaidi’s Mafia Queens of Mumbai, the book that previously inspiredSanjay Leela Bhansali’s 2022 hit, Gangubai Kathiawadi. The results align Bhardwaj with the newly lurid turn mainstream Bollywood has taken with recent smashes Animal and Dhurandhar, but it’s jarring to witness, as if Kenneth Branagh had followed his turn-of-the-90s Shakespeare successes by trying for Natural Born Killers.For Venice (or Baz Luhrmann’s Venice Beach), Bhardwaj swaps the Mumbai underworld of the 1990s, ushering in the movies’ first morally degenerate Romeo. Shahid Kapoor’s Hussein Ustara – nicknamed Romeo – is a heavily tattooed bellower employed as a hitman for a local godfather; his Juliet (Animal’s Triptii Dimri) an aggrieved widow clutching a sizeable hitlist. These two are star-crossed: he rescues her amid a bungled assassination attempt on the lawyer smearing her late husband, earning them both powerful foes. The fish tank through which Leo glimpsed Claire Danes here abuts the bed to which this Romeo takes two escorts while his Juliet listens in. Happy Valentine’s Day, everybody.Bold image-making and considered design are visible through the murk, and the performances are strong. Kapoor and Dimri commit to this plot’s peculiar demands, while Nana Patekar is appreciably sly as our antihero’s wearied handler. Yet where Gangubai showcased Bhansali’s heightened tonal sensitivity, the gruelling three hours here veer between crude and emotionally inert: a tale of obsession and abjection, with its dead-eyed lovers dragging one another towards the gutter and the grave. It’s the kind of distinctive misfire that could only be made by someone who is so hung up on a story they swallow its poisons whole. Still, it’s mildly heartbreaking to see such a thoughtful cineaste tossing his library card for the leering tough guy.O’Romeo is in cinemas now.Explore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsBollywoodFilm adaptationsRomeo and JulietWilliam ShakespeareIndiareviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s an awful tale of body-shaming, humiliation and toxic treatmentElle HuntMon 16 Feb 2026 03.01 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 12.03 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIf you’re a millennial woman, America’s Next Top Model may have been your first experience of appointment TV. The show, which ran for 10 years from 2003, was an early reality juggernaut and made a household name of the supermodel Tyra Banks, its creator and host. At its peak, Top Model drew more than 100 million viewers globally, and left a niche but indelible impact on culture. “Smize”, meaning to “smile with your eyes”, is in theCollins dictionary, while Banks’ infamous tirade (“We were all rooting for you!”) at an unruly model still circulates as a meme.With its high-concept photoshoots and extreme makeovers, Top Model was ahead of its time in manufacturing viral moments. Today, however, the exacting critiques and body-shaming makes for deeply uncomfortable viewing, as gen Zers bingeing the show through the pandemic have pointed out. This latter-day reckoning is the peg for Netflix’s three-part docuseries, Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model.The series boasts remarkable access: Banks, the catwalk coach J Alexander, creative director Jay Manuel, photographer Nigel Barker and executive producer Ken Mok all sit down to interviews, along with dozens of former contestants. It suffers, however, from the usual Netflix issues: it is overlong, unevenly paced and frenetically edited. What could have been a powerful 90-minute film instead spans three hours, yet the zippy, TikTok-y treatment robs it of impact.Banks presents herself as a trailblazer determined to democratise modelling and diversify fashion, but Reality Check shows that Top Model was just as intent on upholding the toxic status quo. Women were weighed on camera, their bodies criticised. Giselle, an African-Latina woman Banks proudly says she fought to cast, was ridiculed for having a “wide ass”. “That’s how I talk to myself, to this day,” she winces, decades later. In a safari-themed photoshoot, a woman deemed to be bigger was made to pose as an elephant.Today, Top Model’s “challenges” seem like humiliation rituals. One contestant, Dani, was pressured to have a gap closed in her teeth. Another, Dionne, was asked to pose with a bullet wound in her head; her mother had been shot by an ex-lover and left paralysed. “I thought it was a coincidence,” she says.Mok airily admits that particular shoot was “a mistake”, as a “celebration of violence”, though he seems impervious to individual suffering. Banks, meanwhile, demurs from addressing storylines and production (“not my territory”).Many contestants came from deprivation, and blame Banks for leading them to believe Top Model was their ticket out. Instead, most found the show worked against them. Surprise, surprise: the fashion industry wasn’t swayed by Top Model’s OTT, increasingly tasteless photoshoots, showing models posing as homeless, murder victims or ethnicities other than their own.Though the judges display more contrition than Mok and Banks, all involved are eager to agree the series falls short of 2026 standards. What Reality Check makes clear, however – but fails to emphasise enough – is that many contestants expressed distress at the time, and were manipulated or pressured into participating.Most disturbing is contestant Shandi’s account of the models’ trip to Milan. After a drunken hot-tub party with some local men they’d met on a photoshoot, Shandi had sex with one in the shower, then went to bed with him, trailed the whole time by camera crews. Neither Shandi nor the documentary explicitly refers to this as sexual assault, but the original Top Model footage suggests she was too drunk to consent. Shandi tearfully tells the documentary that she’d drunk two bottles of wine and was “blacked out for a lot of it”: “I just knew sex was happening, and then I passed out.” And not only did production not intervene, “it all got filmed”.Mok’s defence is that Top Model was filmed “as a documentary, and we told the girls that from day one”, adding that the scene was significantly “scaled back” in post-production. “For good or bad, that was one of the most memorable moments in Top Model.” Shandi says her distressed demands to leave the production were denied, and she was only given a phone to call her boyfriend on the condition that it was filmed and recorded.The crew apologised afterwards, Shandi says: “They just knew that this isn’t right.” Banks’ response, meanwhile, was to take all the women out for some girl talk on theterrazza, holding court about relationship mistakes and “primal desires” as the camera lingered on agonised Shandi. The episode aired with the title “The Girl Who Cheated”.Banks, it must be said, comes across as a real piece of work, passing the buck while bragging about her knack for identifying talent and what audiences want. She even blames Top Model’s extremes on viewers: “You guys were demanding it.” When Banks professes to feel grateful for having been pushed to reflect and evolve, it comes across not just as false, but obliquely threatening: may the rest of us be as gracious when we’re called out, “because that day will come”, she says, ominously.Reality Check is right to conclude on the former contestants, all much happier and healthier-looking than their Top Model days, and powerfully clear-eyed about the mark the show left on them. But it does them a disservice by persistently framing Top Model as a product of its time, and criticism as coming only from woke gen Z. For a show about beauty, Top Model was always ugly – but Reality Check’s conclusions are only skin deep.Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a film which, for all its grimness, is beautifully shot and as engrossing as a lurid soap opera. It’s a story of gender stereotypes, satirising the central mythic tenet of patriarchal Christianity and depicting humanity’s self-invention through violence and stealth. The chief influence is clearly Michael Haneke’s icy black-and-white film The White Ribbon from 2009, on which Schleinzer worked as casting director; Schleinzer shares with Haneke an interest in leaving the audience with an intractable, insoluble mystery: a problem that won’t tie up.The drama effectively conflates real-life cases ofwomen passing themselves off as men in early modern Europewith the well-known case history of theFrench false claimant Martin Guerre. Sandra Hüller gives a superb performance as Rose, a young woman who has been posing as a man all her life and has been a soldier in this guise. She wears dour shapeless clothes, and has the brisk, brusque, economical physical movements of an old soldier; a livid scar that has transformed her face into a worldly and conveniently unfeminine grimace. She says it is the result of a bullet that she now wears around her neck on a cord, a kind of unlucky charm, a reminder of her survival.After the war, Rose arrived in what she claims is her home village to take family ownership of a derelict but potentially workable farmstead. By recounting local anecdotes that only the genuine claimant could know, Rose convinces the local elders (who have evidently accepted “Rose” as her surname) and almost immediately makes a great success of the farm through her disciplined hard work. She moreover wins the locals’ hearts by killing a marauding bear with her military musket.A prosperous neighbour agrees to sell Rose a parcel of land on condition that Rose marries his daughter Suzanna (Caro Braun), a plain and promisingly biddable figure of bovine piety and domestic industry. But if Suzanna does not get pregnant, the contract is null and void, and the villagers will begin to talk. So it is with some astonishment that Rose receives extraordinary news from the beaming and placidly innocent Suzanna. How? Who is the father? The question is asked just twice, first put directly by Rose to Suzanna who does not reply. Rose does not pursue it, perhaps assuming some banal infidelity, and in any case grateful for the virgin-birth miracle which has underpinned her growing household wealth.The second time it is put by the presiding judge to Rose at her trial. She has answered previously with a defiant calm reminiscent ofRenée Jeanne Falconetti in Dreyer’s The Passion of Joan of Arc, but this time does not reply. The judge also does not press the point, perhaps not wanting to deflect or complicate the prosecution case, or make a potential new land claimant of the biological father. Nor would he want to risk, with Rose’s repeated refusals to answer, creating a martyrdom-mystique around the defendant who is already becoming a celebrity among the excitable public. And there is to be a further, startling disclosure.Hüller’s quiet, sinewy performance provides the film’s form and musculature; Rose has clearly been through a thousand crises and ordeals on the field of battle and learned the level-headed watchfulness necessary to survive. Braun is also very good as the unexpectedly spirited Suzanna. This is a film about the power and violence that occupies an invisible stratum below the bürgerlich calm, a stratum which becomes obvious when it is challenged. It’s another outstanding star performance from Hüller.Rose screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsGermanyAustriaBerlin film festivalBerlin film festival 2026reviewsShareReuse this content"

A lone female English voice appears to accompany her, high and pure against the buzzing drone of a harmonium, singing about a woman roaming alone, and a man who, for “seven years, left the land”, before his eventual return.Long before Emerald Fennell found Olivia Chaney’s version of 19th-century ballad the Dark Eyed Sailor online, Chaney was preparing to sing it for a 2013 live session on Mark Radcliffe’s BBC Radio 2 folk show, in the midst of her own Brontë-esque love triangle. “I was at the beginning of my relationship with the man who is now my husband and the father of my two children – he nearly married someone else, and I nearly had kids with someone else.”She recounts this from her Yorkshire living room, minutes after getting home from the nursery run. “So to see this song first pop up to support Cathy’s emotions around her being with the wrong man … it was very spooky.”Fennell told Chaney she was choosing between three of her songs for the film. She settled on this one “because she connected with it”, says Chaney. “There’s something about the way she uses my voice, not surrounded by [an] orchestra at all, that shows how raw and emotional I felt.”Olivia Chaney: Dark Eyed Sailor – videoThe song’s rescue from the vaults came at a serendipitous time for Chaney, a wide-ranging artist recently returning to folk. Her previous three albums, mainly of originals, include 2024’s Circus of Desire; its title track was remixed by Vessel, and Chaney’s dancing in the video recalled the two years she spent singing live with Zero 7. On 27 February, she plays her first gig with her new British folk-rock band, News From Nowhere, which has quite the lineup: Tom Skinner, the drummer from the Smile and Sons of Kemet (“one of my favourite musicians on earth”), Owen Spafford on violin and electronics, singer-songwriter Clara Mann, and composer/producer Leo Abrahams, with whom Chaney recorded her debut EP the same year as that fateful Mark Radcliffe session.Chaney discovered folk music as a path for herself in her 20s. She knew some folk-rock and singer-songwriters from her parents’ record collection, but she sang Hildegard of Bingen’s music with the Oxford Girls’ Choir, and won a scholarship to Chetham’s School of Music at 14 to study voice and piano, going on to study jazz at the Royal Academy of Music in London in 2000.Seven years later, after being stood up on a date – “a bit blue, really in my own world, and not knowing where to go with my singing” – she went to an afterparty with friends at London’s Southbank Centre. “And I saw this really shy busker playing this heavenly music. I ran over, begging, ‘What are you playing? Who are you like? Do you want to work together?’” The busker, Matthew Ord, now a lecturer in folk music at Newcastle university, was playing Planxty Irwin, a tune by the 17th-century Irish composer and blind harpist Turlough O’Carolan.Ord taught Chaney many traditional songs, including Dark Eyed Sailor: “I really responded to the words and the emotions in it,” she says. Then, one day, he turned up at her house with a harmonium and asked if she wanted to play it. “And that was that.”View image in fullscreenOlivia Chaney performing in London.Photograph: Monika S. JakubowskaChaney became one of Britain’s most exciting new folk performers, earning the respect of veteran folk artists. She supported Shirley Collins on her 2017 tour, sang with Richard Thompson at his 70th birthday concert at the Royal Albert Hall and performed at last year’s all-star tribute gig to Martin Carthy in Hackney. She also fronted folk-rock supergroup Offa Rex with the Decemberists; their brilliant 2017 album, Queen of Hearts, was nominated for a Grammy.This summer, she’s also releasing an album of songs by composer Henry Purcell and performing them with a chamber ensemble at the London venue Kings Place, where she’s an artist in residence this year. “Purcell wrote for kings and queens, but he was also down the pub listening to the ballads and the broadsides,” says Chaney. “His ability to write a catchy tune, almost like a pop hook, made his songs go straight back into the street culture of the day. I’m so interested in those connections.”Charli xcx: Wuthering Heights review – atonal, amorous anthems that more than stand apart from the filmRead moreThat cross-cultural mindset is typical of Chaney’s outlook. The only other voice heard singing inWuthering Heightsis that of Charli xcx, who produced a companion album to the record. “I think her music’s great and very harmonious with my song – it all ties in really well together,” says Chaney. “Even though there are some bangers, harmonically they are in a similar world to Dark Eyed Sailor. There’s even synths and sounds that are in a similar sonic tonal world to my harmonium.”For years, Chaney’s version of Dark Eyed Sailor only existed in live YouTube clips, but she finally released a recorded version last Friday, produced by Oli Deakin (mastermind of CMAT’s albums If My Wife New I’d Be Dead and Euro-Country). She’d recorded “many” versions of it before – three were even mastered for albums, but “never quite fit”. She finally heard it fit at the Wuthering Heights premiere in Leicester Square on 5 February.What was the evening like? “Drinking champagne behind Richard E Grant?” She laughs. “Insane. I gripped my husband’s hand so tight when the song came in – hearing my voice all alone – that it reminded me of giving birth, gripping my doula’s hand so hard I nearly broke her knuckles!”The song appears again when Heathcliff returns to Cathy, now rich and grown up, and in the film’s final, longing minutes. It’s always been Chaney’s husband’s favourite recording, she adds. “It’s a song I love very much. It comes back and haunts you.”Olivia Chaney’sresidency at Kings Placestarts on 27 February.Explore more on these topicsMusicFolk musicWuthering HeightsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

This is the unenviable situation for Lily, the protagonist of O’Farrell’s second novel, who is swept off her feet by dashing architect Marcus and in short order moves in with him. Lily takes his assurances that her predecessor Sinead is “no longer with us” to mark a more permanent absence; in fact, Sinead has simply been thrown over, and it is in the details of the collapse of her relationship with Marcus that the novel most engages. Hints of the gothic ghost story deepen one of the main takeaways, which is that Marcus consists almost entirely of red flags.View image in fullscreen9The Distance Between Us (2004)Heritage and belonging drive much of O’Farrell’s fiction, and the gradual release of information to her readers often propels her narratives. She’s also interested in journeys both literal and figurative, and begins this novel in Hong Kong, where celebrations to mark the Chinese New Year are disrupted by sudden, dangerous mayhem. Meanwhile, a woman on a bridge in London glimpses a familiar face and takes this as her cue to leave the country. These dramatic events make little initial sense, but it’s the contrast between the immediate isolation of the characters and their complex and densely populated backgrounds that draws us in.View image in fullscreen8The Hand That First Held Mine(2010)O’Farrell repeatedly returns to the territory of new motherhood, and to how it intersects with the trauma of previous generations, and here she sets up two mirroring storylines. At the novel’s start we are introduced to Elina, an artist in contemporary London, who is navigating the aftermath of the birth of her first child, and to Lexie, who arrives in the capital in the 1950s from small-town England and almost immediately finds herself capsized by a transgressive love affair. What links them will unfold, but it’s the portrait of life before and after giving birth – characterised by a reconfiguring of identity – that holds the reader’s attention.View image in fullscreen7After You’d Gone (2000)O’Farrell’s debut novel won a Betty Trask award, and it’s easy to see why the judges thought this was a writer with promise. Most striking is its ambition: the central character, Alice, lies in a coma, which the reader gathers follows an unnamed but cataclysmic event. Mysterious, too, is the sudden realisation that struck Alice in a public lavatory in a train station on the day after her accident – a strand of the narrative that takes us back into her childhood and the obscured life of her difficult, thwarted mother. Additional plotlines unfurl a love story imperilled by religious and cultural collisions, displaying O’Farrell’s interest in exploring taboos and their long effects.View image in fullscreen6Instructions for a Heatwave (2013)Those too young to remember the cracked riverbeds and communal water pumps of Britain’s 1976 heatwave will enjoy the period detail of O’Farrell’s sixth novel, which forms the backdrop of a compulsively readable missing person mystery. The absentee in question is Robert Riordan, a newly retired Irish Londoner who goes out for a newspaper one morning and fails to return. Summoned home to support their mother, Gretta, Robert’s three adult children find themselves uncomfortably cheek by jowl, and it’s watching the family dynamics play tensely out in this moment of apparent crisis that provides most of the novel’s deliciously depicted drama.View image in fullscreen5The Marriage Portrait (2022)A chilling episode in Renaissance matrimonial history and a celebrated Victorian poem form the basis of O’Farrell’s most recent novel, which reimagines the fate of Lucrezia de’ Medici, child bride of the Duke of Ferrara. Lucrezia’s death in 1561, possibly by poisoning, inspired Robert Browning’s My Last Duchess, which leaves its readers in little doubt that her husband was an unrepentant murderer. O’Farrell’s purpose, in recreating the events at Ferrara’s court and their later representation, is to allow us to consider the ease with which women and girls were shuffled between dynastic families and opulent courts – and to wonder what might have happened had they ever been permitted a whisper of agency.View image in fullscreen4This Must Be the Place (2016)There’s something of the jeu d’esprit about this story of the whereabouts of Claudette Wells, a mercurial film star who has called time on her career and hunkered down in the wilds of Donegal. That O’Farrell tells her story through multiple narrators, hopping between settings and time periods, increases the suspicion that the author was intent on creating a kaleidoscopic effect, in which the overall picture is constantly shattering and re-forming. But a central story still emerges, and it is Daniel, Claudette’s linguist husband, who is left to try and put all the pieces together – and to determine whether or not the couple’s marriage can endure.View image in fullscreen3The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox (2006)Years beforeHamnet, O’Farrell made a partial foray into historical fiction to captivating effect: this split time-frame novel of family secrets remains one of her most admired works. In the present day, Iris attempts to fathom the fate of her great-aunt Esme, who disappeared from record as a young woman in Edinburgh; she could ask her grandmother Kitty, Esme’s sister, if Kitty’s grasp on reality hadn’t been unmoored by Alzheimer’s disease. The picture that emerges from Iris’s stalwart research is a disturbing one: Esme hasn’t taken flight, but was in fact committed to a psychiatric unit 60 years previously for entirely dubious and non-psychiatric reasons.View image in fullscreen2I Am, I Am, I Am: Seventeen Brushes With Death (2017)Some of the encounters detailed in this gripping memoir may seem closer than others to bringing the author’s life to a premature end: the childhood contraction of encephalitis, which left her with permanent neurological issues, is more profoundly altering than the terror she felt as a guinea pig for a stage knife-thrower. But each of these experiences sharpened O’Farrell’s understanding of the precarity and strangeness of human mortality, and they are recounted with a kind of astonishment at her own survival. Most serious and moving of all is the book’s final essay, an account of her daughter’s daily battle with a life-threatening immunological condition, which transforms the world into a landscape of potentially catastrophic threats.View image in fullscreen1Hamnet (2020)Even before Chloé Zhao, Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal brought Hamnet to a screen near you, O’Farrell’s eighth novel was a huge success story, winning the Women’s prize for fiction and expanding her already significant readership. There was the premise, of course: fictionalising the death of William Shakespeare’s 11-year-old son Hamnet in 1596 was an eye-catchingly bold move, but O’Farrell then de-centred the playwright, focusing instead on his wife, Agnes, and setting the novel not in London but in Stratford-upon-Avon. It is there that her act of imaginative reclamation takes place, as we see Agnes – not, as she became, the sidelined Anne Hathaway of history – as a practised and skilful herbalist, and follow her into the agonising throes of grief.To browse all titles by Maggie O’Farrell, visitguardianbookshop.com.

The British neuroscientist created this striking image more than 80 years ago, a time when mechanised looms, not computers, embodied the idea of technology. Even so, the symbolism feels relevant. We struggle to talk of our brains or minds without recourse to the machine metaphor: once it was clocks, then looms, and now computers. We say that our brains are hardwired; we talk of our ability to process information.The quote appears as merely a footnote in Michael Pollan’s new book, A World Appears, a fabulous and mind-expanding exploration of consciousness: how and why we are self-aware. But the whole thing can be read as a lucid and impassioned riposte to Sherrington’s conception of the mind as a machine. In Pollan’s view, we have become imprisoned by such narratives, which have obscured the richness and complexity of human and non-human consciousness. Bridging both science and the humanities, Pollan mines neuroscientific research, philosophy, literature and his own mind, searching for different ways to think about being, and what it feels like.Pollan’s curiosity was piqued after he took magic mushrooms and began to view the plants around him as sentient. “It seemed obvious that not only were these plants cognisant of their environment, but they also had preferences, agency, and a viewpoint of their own,” he writes. Obvious perhaps for an author on psilocybin, but it turns out there are many scientists who would agree with his conclusion. They call themselves “plant neurobiologists”. The title is deliberately provocative; plants, of course, do not possess neurons, though, as Pollan learns, they exhibit some of the qualities we associate with species that do: plants can learn and form memories, predict changes in their environment and respond appropriately, send and receive signals from other plants, and alter their behaviour depending on circumstances.Plant neurobiologists hypothesise that the seat of this intelligence is the roots, which form a leaderless network of cells exchanging information through chemical or electrical signals, much like neurons. (Pollan cites the research of Michael Levin, who has shown that simple cells can communicate through bioelectricity, and can even store memories.) This chapter upended many of my assumptions about intelligence and also raised unsettling questions. Can plants make decisions? Do they feel pain? “I cannot help but think of plants as … these locked-in syndrome patients that cannot flag that they are mentally alive,” says one of the researchers.The metaphors that we have for the mind, largely drawn from the world of machines, are not up to the taskPollan himself charts a careful course between anthropomorphism (plants as “locked-in patients”) and its opposite, a wilful denial of their sophistication. He doesn’t think of them as conscious, preferring “sentient”, which he classifies as an evolutionary step before consciousness. A distinguishing feature of consciousness, he argues, is feeling and emotion, which scientists have “located” in the upper brainstem, one of the most ancient parts of the human brain (and one that is also present in other species, something that raises important ethical implications).Unlike our ability to use language, our emotions have proved resistant to artificial reproduction. Pollan draws us into the weird universe of synthetic consciousness, in which neuroscientists and computer scientists are seeking to build a conscious AI by endowing it with feelings and desires, such as hunger, thirst and the need to rest. These pages are decidedly eerie, but it soon becomes clear that such exercises simply confirm what’s distinctive about human consciousness; as Pollan notes, when an AI registers information, it is not the same as feeling. He refrains from judgment on these experiments, though one of his interlocutors asks a pointed question of the researchers conducting them: “Why don’t they just have a baby?”‘I’m the psychedelic confessor’: the man who turned a generation on to hallucinogens returns with a head-spinning book about consciousnessRead moreI experienced a kind of claustrophobia and estrangement reading about the various theories of consciousness, their soulless lexicon seemingly drawn from a business school manual (one leading hypothesis is called global workspace theory). So too does Pollan, a science writer, yes, but one schooled in the humanities, more concerned with the exploding of categories rather than their strict delineation. Of the 22 or so theories on offer, none, Pollan writes, has come close to resolving the “problem” of consciousness. The metaphors that we have for the mind, largely drawn from the world of machines, are not up to the task (in one of the most interesting passages, he lays out precisely how the human mind is different from a computer; how feelings and thoughts cannot be reduced to the mere processing of information, and are intimately connected to our biology). Those seeking to replicate human-like consciousness on a chip may resemble Sisyphus more than Dr Frankenstein.Pollan likens the study of consciousness to cosmology: just as we can only examine the universe from within it, there is no way for us to position ourselves outside our own consciousness. You can almost sense his relief when he moves away from the reductionism of neuroscientists to consider the work of those who embrace their own subjective positions. William James appears as a guiding light; the pioneering philosopher and psychologist carefully noted the ambiguities of the human mind, its shifts and nuances. Like James, Pollan experiments on himself, sampling his inner experiences at random times of the day with the assistance of a social psychologist, but he quickly finds that what is going on in his own mind is often beyond the reach of language. The later chapters, which draw on everything from Buddhist thought to modernist literature, remind us of what is obvious if only we stop to notice: that our minds are constantly in flux, remoulding, shifting, flowing.Much of Pollan’s book reminded me of Siri Hustvedt’s brilliant 2016 extended essay,The Delusions of Certainty, a lucid critique of scientific reductionism. Like that work, Pollan’s book attempts to disentangle the ideas we have inherited about our own minds, an inheritance of which we are not even aware. All too often, these theories have visited “violence” on our own consciousness, he writes. Violence is a strong word, and it implies a harm. So what is the harm, and to whom is it being done? Pollan lives in the Bay Area of California, and, although his book rarely mentions Silicon Valley, it can be read as an act of resistance towards the financial and technological interests that are invested in distancing us from our inner lives and emotions.He cites the MIT sociologist Sherry Turkle, who wrote: “Technology can make us forget what we know about life.” I’d agree, though I’d add that to forget something, one needs to know it in the first place, and there may come a time when we are so divorced from the richness of our own minds that we will mistake the mere processing of information for consciousness, the machine metaphor for reality. That, perhaps, is the monster that stalks this book: our concern should be less about what kind of AI we might produce – whether a machine may one day experience love or hatred – and more what kind of a human will be fashioned by AI and our interactions with technology; whether we will settle for an impoverished conception of our own minds, or can be reacquainted with its wonders.A World Appears: A Journey into Consciousness by Michael Pollan is published by Allen Lane (£25).

Whether Rice is observing the enforced machine-order of the production line, evaluating his own thoughts about cinema, music and literature, or empathising with the other workers, each individual short poem is a cherished fragment of perception seeking a moment of freedom from the tyranny of its time-stamp. The two pieces I’ve chosen are exactly four hours and more than 20 poems apart; distinct in tone and structure, each registers awareness that the potential of the individuals concerned, as a collective or singly, is frustrated by their socio-economic position.The workers in 01.29 are on a break, but their star-gazing is presented from the limited and immediate perspective in which the nearest stars are tobacco-sparks, “the exhaled Milky Way / of Bobby’s Golden Virginia”. The Milky Way leads only to earthbound “ways to navigate shift patterns”. Imaginative or intellectual speculation is forbidden by the laws of factory routine that the workers have had to internalise.Fully aware of that limitation, the speaker keeps possibility tamped down, while simultaneously acknowledging its power. The phrase “insanity of depth” inscribes the dizziness a free-spirited mental navigation of the cosmos might risk. The speaker and his colleagues are necessary conspirators against visions, star-gazers from the depth of despairing realism. While the poem insists on “nothing seismic or anything approaching / truth”, it acknowledges that the denial falls far short of human “depth”. Stars, increasingly distant, mark time like the numerals on the digital clock but infinitely slower: whereas the sparks released from “Bobby’s Golden Virginia” are all too ephemeral, “the dotted starlight/ doesn’t burn fast enough” for the night-shift workers.In the second poem, the speaker focuses on a single worker, “wee Gail”, and, by the second line, although her 70th birthday was “last week”, the present-continuous tense is seemingly established: “she has a special / seat to sit on all shift”. Her seat may be connected to the friendly recognition of her birthday, but, more likely, she habitually occupies a particular bench-space for ergonomic reasons, in line with company regulations. The image of the seat is rightly left for the reader to form – and then to transform.Centrally placed, a single line of monosyllables illustrates the one-dimensionality of Gail’s service “in the same place for so long”, but the resumed triplets have her “making light work” of it all as she skilfully performs her task, “sifting defective ring washers / from those within tolerance”. The poet-speaker, too, makes light work of the romantic, celebratory turn after “and” at the end of the third triplet, when the ensuing pause instigates the vision of deft-fingered Gail as, perhaps, a concert pianist. This wouldn’t be impossible “in another life”. Even here, Rice is almost curbed by realism. Somehow, he succeeds in lifting that heavy shadow cast by “another life”, dissolving it in the glow of what feels like genuine admiration and genuine affirmation.In an endnote, Rice pays tribute to a book set in 1830 by the French philosopher, Jacques Rancière,Proletarian Nights: The Worker’s Dream in 19th-Century France. In Rancière’s vision of socialism, labourers desire, and have the potential for, freedom from their work. Rice addresses the mental and physical costs of the labour treadmill, and, as a poet andson of a poet, he is haunted by the concept of repressed creative potential in others. The poem about “wee Gail” is a particularly direct and moving expression of that vision.The fulfillment of Rancière’s ideal looms close to us in the age of AI, with the decline of human labour at even the white-collar level, and in production lines’ replacement-staffing by robots. Freedom for self-fulfillment will be available, in theory, but how will it be inscribed and allocated by our institutions? The many questions will be tough to solve. In the meantime, the poems in plastic both honour and transcend their traditional factory setting, and remind us of how much there could be to gain in the dawning digital era.plastic: A Poem by Matthew Rice, is published in the UKby Fitzcarraldo Editionsand in the USby Soft Skull Press.This article was amended on 16 February 2026 because an earlier version referred to Jacques Rancière’s Proletarian Nights: The Worker’s Dream in 19th-Century France, as “an 1830 book”. The book is set in 1830, but was published in 1981.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Humour, of course, in the things the child misinterprets; pathos in the things they feel they must keep hidden; jeopardy in the dangers we can see, and they cannot. As any relative or babysitter can attest, even the sweetest child can become mind-numbingly dull when they’re all the company one has, so there’s a skill to charm without boring. The other skill is to find ways of enabling the reader to read over the child’s shoulder, as it were, to piece together for themselves the adult dramas to which a child’s natural egotism, or simple innocence, blinds them.In 1988, the longsuffering mother in Seán Farrell’s first novel, Frogs for Watchdogs, is stranded. This Englishwoman has had a boy and a girl with a handsome rogue of an Irish actor, but he has walked out on them. Asked to leave a commune unsuited to children, skint, too proud, perhaps, to return to the protection of well-heeled parents in England, she rents a farmhouse on the cheap in the deep countryside of County Meath, where she can grow vegetables, raise hens and a few sheep, and attempt to scrabble a living as a healer. (From the multiple dilutions her boy witnesses her perform, her fairly batty practice would seem to be some form of homeopathy with new age elements thrown in.) While her doubtless appalled parents insist on sending the oldest child, a forthright girl called B, to an English boarding school, B’s younger brother spends months running happily feral. Once he is eight, he will be old enough to follow her and be tamed and anglicised.Unnamed, so that he becomes a sort of Everyboy, he is a vividly unwashed, scabby-kneed creation, consumed by a little-man protective love for his mother and sister, ruled by devoutly held private rituals that are bound up in the passionate interest he takes in the landscape, birds and animals around him, from the screeching crows to the easily spooked Jacob’s sheep. He is drawn to a no less eccentric and evidently lonely old woman in the village, to whom he delivers his mother’s cures and who repays him with biscuits, barely comprehended scandal and snatches of doomy superstition to match his own.So far, so muddily idyllic, but then a farm worker from Inishmaan, Gearóid Ó Direáin, who lives in a caravan up the road, starts to take an interest, helping the boy’s mother build a drystone wall and taking cures from her in turn. The boy follows the anglophone locals and wilfully mispronounces his Irish name, dubbing him Jerry Drain. Deeply mistrustful, fighting the instincts of a fatherless boy to be drawn to a father figure, he meets his low-key charm offensive with a campaign of unsmiling wordlessness. When that fails, and as even his sternly bookish sister seems to be succumbing, he mixes rat poison into the latest cure his mother has him deliver to Gearóid, recovering his tongue sufficiently to deliver the instruction to swallow multiple doses.Frogs for Watchdogs was garlanded with praise on its Irish publication last spring, and it’s easy to see why. It is funny, evokes a child’s vivid sense of place and ultimately is deeply touching as Gearóid trains up the boy to help him in a chip van venture, gives him discreet lessons in how to be a decent man and, as the time approaches when the regular bathing and school uniform of England can no longer be avoided, wins him over by minute degrees, as one might coax trust from a stray dog.The pity is that Farrell doesn’t entirely trust his ability to convey all the reader needs to understand through the boy’s own voice. On several occasions he slips into Gearóid’s head, to give us his perspective on the boy. Because this tells us nothing we haven’t already guessed, apart from the fact that Gearóid lost his own father to a drowning when he was the boy’s age, it serves merely to disrupt the child-centred narrative and to make the man seem less intriguing, even a sentimental figure. This is a minor criticism, however, of a novel whose crinkle-eyed charm is so hard to resist.Frogs for Watchdogs by Seán Farrell is published by John Murray (£14.99).

Chinese artistYin Xiuzhenmourns by preserving, stitching, sewing. Working in 1990s Beijing, she saw a city transforming so fast, and casting off its history with so little ceremony, that she had to save it somehow. Her show at the Hayward is full of scraps of the past, piled up, splayed out and knitted together in a desperate attempt to slow the onslaught of modernisation.Obviously, it didn’t work, Beijing is as modernised as cities come, but the works within her show, Heart to Heart, are a knowingly futile gesture. A little wooden trunk, built by the artist’s father, is filled with a neat stack of her old clothes, all encased in concrete. The soft warmth of her personal past preserved in the cold brutality of composite, the material irrevocably transforming her city and her life. Nearby, traditional roof tiles are scattered on the floor around an old Chinese cupboard, all covered in a thick, filthy layer of cement powder. Everywhere you look, the past is being buried to make way for the future.A minivan in the middle of the room has been extended, its body lengthened into a stitched-together concertina of recycled clothes. She is trying, over and over, to maintain some kind of link to humanity, to the past, in the face of unstoppable change and evolution.View image in fullscreen‘A tourist-trap model village made of rags’ … Yin Xiuzhen’s Portable City: London, 2026.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockThe futility of it all is obvious and makes these early works feel tangibly sad. Photos of an early installation show big blocks of ice made from polluted river water being symbolically scrubbed by passersby on the riverbank. “We cannot stop the physical impact of pollution on a small scale,” she says in a quote on the wall, “but we can create moments of collective reflection.”This early work is deeply felt and moving. Which you can’t really say for the more recent stuff here. She encases books in old fabric; she makes models of cities out of old clothes and packs them into suitcases. There’s a whole luggage carousel built into the gallery and a jumbo jet made out of tatty T-shirts hanging from the ceiling. The whole thing looks tacky, like a tourist-trap model village made of rags, a charity shop version of Legoland and, worst of all, it’s barely saying anything.Ideas of commerce, global trade and their exploitative capitalistic tendencies are written into the material she uses – that’s the narrative baked into the fabric of recycled textiles. But there’s no criticism, no depth, no point to its use in these works. Here’s some old T-shirts turned into Big Ben. Ta-dah.The main installation here is a giant human heart – yes, made of old T-shirts – intended as a space for, and I quote, “deep and meaningful conversations”. You have to create your own meaning here, because the artist can’t really be bothered.View image in fullscreenEverything and nothing … Chiharu Shiota’s Letters of Thanks, 2026.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockUpstairs, another exhibition – dubbed Threads of Life – finds Japanese artistChiharu Shiotaweaving endless webs of red and black thread. Shiota’s work has been a social media phenomenon in recent years, and the Hayward is obviously hoping that her dizzying, knotty installations will get the punters in.The first room is a tangled nightmare of crimson lines dangling with keys. We’re all connected, but how do we unlock those connections? Got it. The second room is filled with emotional letters of thanks, stapled to red threads hanging from the ceiling. Literally tugging on heart strings. Got it. Red string gets swapped for black in the final space, all woven around beds, like the Hayward has opened the world’s dirtiest, gothiest, spideriest hotel.The whole thing’s about blood and death and life and how we’re all connected, sure. But it’s so superficial that it’s totally meaningless, so on the nose it gives you a nosebleed. It’s so about everything, it’s essentially about nothing.But, and this is crucial, it will look good on your social media feed. Art institutions are in a tough bind – ha, like with threads! Either they put on interesting, clever, powerful art that no one comes to see, or they bow to the pressure of hosting pretty, vacuous immersive installations that will look good onInstagramin the desperate hope of selling some tickets. Damned if they do, ’grammed if they don’t.Realistically, this isn’t aimed at anyone who wants a genuine encounter with art; it’s aimed at people who want to take selfies in galleries. I hope it works for them, because otherwise it’s a real waste of thread.Yin Xiuzhen: Heart to Heart and Chiharu Shiota: Threads of Life are atHayward Gallery, London, until 3 May.Explore more on these topicsArtInstagramSouthbank CentrereviewsShareReuse this content"

No entry? I wonder as I step tentatively into the gallery. The word appears again and again – always painted in red – across the large sheet of fabric that divides the first gallery space. Later, it decorates Delaine Le Bas’s skirt in a photograph in which she stands in a field, holding a placard that states: “No state control.”View image in fullscreenDelaine Le Bas, No State Control, photographed in Findon, West Sussex (after Horace Poolaw’s Trecil Poolaw Unap, Mountain View, Oklahoma, 1929).Photograph: Lincoln Cato/Courtesy the artistsIt could seem unwelcoming, but printed amid the prevailing colours of pink, blue and yellow, repeating like a catchy pop song, it does something else. “It is ‘no’ as an affirmation,” says Le Bas. “It is like, ‘No, then, we mustn’t let them steal our joy.’” It’s a shout of protection, like a child stubbornly refusing to relinquish something precious. The “no” is not directed at us, but beyond us, creating a boundary that suspends reality for a moment and cocoons the viewer in layers of soft fabric and folklore.Un-Fair-Ground establishes a space where a spirit of generosity and warmth allows difficult questions to be asked about land, art ownership and identity. Le Bas – who was a 2024 Turner prize nominee – is shaped by her Romany heritage and keenly aware of the ways in which structures created to “protect” one thing can be weaponised to exclude another. In Un-Fair-Ground she flips the narrative, so the protected heritage is her own, as she takes 20 pieces from the Whitworth’s collection to serve her story.Le Bas’s ability to welcome and interrogate in unison comes to fruition in Witch House, a new installation that expands on her2009 work, Witch Hunt. Down a painted cobbled street, we enter an inviting home with hand-sewn Serbian shoes in the centre and dappled light falling through the calico-draped roof. On the walls is a vibrant wallpaper, created by Le Bas in honour of the Whitworth’s wallpaper collection, one of the largest in the world.“Meet your neighbours”, the wallpaper advises, as photos of Le Bas as a child mingle with illustrations of Delaine and her late husband, Damian, cutouts of dolls, union flags and cartoons. There’s the text of a Conservative party policy request to repeal the Human Rights Act in a way detrimental to Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people. At points, works by William Blake, Joan Miró and Paula Rego from the Whitworth’s collection literally tear through the wallpaper.View image in fullscreenDelaine Le Bas, L’Archipel en Feu/The Archipelago on Fire.Photograph: Alexander Christie/Courtesy the artist / Alexander ChristieThis scrambling of the usual hierarchies employed when displaying art creates connections elsewhere in the show. In L’Archipel en Feu – a triptych of hand-stitched and hand-painted fabrics – animals, nature and bodies blend. A rabbit hops through vibrant, cellophane flowers; a shadowy woman throws the moon; a horse’s head sits atop a female body. In Delainia: 17071965 Unfolding, a video work projected on to pieces of thin fabric and a large circular mirror, figures move in and out of colourful textiles, while the footage skips to shots of a forest. This kaleidoscope of images exposes the fragmented way in which all human narratives are constructed.In contrast to the rest of the rainbow proceedings, the final gallery space is muted, the walls draped in magnolia calico. Most of the works in this space are not by Le Bas; they include pieces by Brazilian sculptor Ana Maria Pacheco,“outsider artist” Madge Gilland Damian Le Bas. The presentation of the works on fabric instead of solid wall generates a feeling of temporality, as if we are only gathered here for a moment. It is curious, especially with Pacheco’s sinister figures smirking out of The Endeavours of a Certain Poet, but I wonder where all the joy has gone. Even Le Bas’s works in this room take on a different spirit; her palette is monochrome and her paint is thick and heavy; fabric hands reach out from the edges of the calico walls like spectres trying to pull us in.View image in fullscreenDelaine Le Bas, Un-Fair-Ground installation at the Whitworth.Photograph: Michael Pollard/© The Whitworth, The University of ManchesterThe exhibition is named after the artist’s mural, Un-Fair-Ground, which is now in the hallway at the Whitworth. It was originally exhibited at the Unfairground area at Glastonbury festival in 2024, and takes visual elements of a fairground – cartoons, clowns and bold colours – and mixes them with stars, eyes, ears, the female form, creatures, iconography and Greek mythology. At the top is a huge, golden sun, shimmering ethereally under the Whitworth lights. This isn’t Un Fair Ground, a place where all is fair, but an Un-Fair-Ground, where ground is neither fair nor unfair, but just a space for connection – and a glorious, defiant welcome.Delaine Le Bas: Un-Fair-Ground is at theWhitworth, Manchesteruntil 31 MayExplore more on these topicsArtPaintingSculptureInstallationreviewsShareReuse this content"

One is PowerPoint comedy; the other is humour mined from personal trauma. At first, form is foregrounded over content, as Sharp goes wild with a clicker, projecting his introductory battery of “hellos”, “hi’s” and “welcomes” in ginormous letters on an upstage screen. There will be 2,000 slides in this 75-minute show, he tells us, and they will demonstrate that every beat is (despite appearances) scripted and preordained.And so the stage is set for a feat of virtuosity from the former child magician – but also some reveal of why this frantic mode of presentation is right for the story Sharp has to tell. Is it to do with his generation’s habit of double-screening their entertainment? He hints it might be, then moves on. What we get instead is the coming-out story of this southerner turned New Yorker, which involves his mother’s terminal cancer and, obliquely, his own watery near-death experience a few years ago.Do these two shows satisfyingly unite into a coherent whole? Sharp throws himself at that challenge, roping in Schrödinger’s cat and quantum immortality theory to undergird his exploration of being alive and dead (or on stage and on screen) all at the same time. In a show forever alert to its own status as confessional performance (“theatre with an r-e,” in his words), he also admits that all this tech whizzery is designed to conceal the cliche of talking parental bereavement and queer self-discovery on stage.For me, the constant underscoring, echoing and backchat on screen distracts from – keeps at a distance, even – what’s most meaningful about Sharp’s story. But that tale still packs a considerable punch, and its teller is an endearing presence throughout. There are solid stand-alone standup bits (about urban umbrella usage and a “weenie massage”), amusingly arch Gen-Z stylings and an affecting tenderness towards his mum and dad. And if the PowerPoint gimmick and emotional rites-of-passage can feel as if they’re pulling in different directions – well, the combination (super-slick slideshow theatrics, big laughs and heart-on-a-stick story to boot) still represent pretty big bang for your buck.At Soho theatre, London, until 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

In 1963, it hosted the founding meeting of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the precursor to today’s African Union. Africa was then emerging from centuries of colonial rule, and many of the OAU’s founders – including Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah and Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt – had led their nations to independence.“Only a few years ago,” the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie said at the time, “meetings to consider African problems were held outside Africa, and the fate of its peoples were decided by non-Africans. Today … the peoples of Africa can, at long last, deliberate on their own problems and future.”Mezzedimi’s design emanated a spirit of optimism, embodying functional clarity and spatial openness, sitting in a garden landscape with expansive views over Addis Ababa. Organised around a horseshoe-shaped plenary hall crowned by a vast rotunda, its interior incorporated Carrara marble, Ethiopian stone and Mezzedimi’s elegant, custom-designed furniture. Artworks included a 40-metre mural illustrating the richness of African flora, by Italian painter Nenne Sanguineti Poggi, and a stunning triptych of monumental stained glass windows by Ethiopian artist Afewerk Tekle.View image in fullscreenAfewerk Tekle’s monumental triptych, Total Liberation of Africa, created in 1961.Photograph: Rory GardinerThis foundational site of modern African political history was commissioned by Selassie, then eager to implement an ambitious unifying vision for the continent and his country. Ethiopia remains the only African country never fully colonised by a European power. Along with Addis Ababa’s city hall, also designed by Mezzedimi – who completed more than 100 buildings across the Horn of Africa – it was one of two statement projects intended to demonstrate, in Selassie’s words, “that it is possible to construct grand buildings here too [in Ethiopia]”.Over the decades, however, like many structures of its era, Africa Hall fell into decline and disrepair. After a £42m, decade-long programme of restoration, completed in 2024, the rejuvenated building is once again emblematic of pan-African progress, renewed as an important venue for diplomacy and cultural exchange.Africa Hall is still making history. The restoration project has just been awarded the World Monuments Fund/Knoll Modernism prize, the most prestigious accolade in the often underappreciated field of conserving modernist heritage. It’s the first time a building in Africa has been honoured since the biennial prize was inaugurated in 2008 – previous winners include a concrete villa in Argentina, a French school dedicated to Karl Marx and the restoration of Preston bus station (designed in 1968 by Building Design Partnership, working with the Danish engineer Ove Arup).View image in fullscreenAfrica Hall’s plenary hall, post-renovation, in 2024.Photograph: Rory Gardiner“Modern architecture captures some of the most ambitious ideas of the 20th century, but its innovations also render these buildings vulnerable to the passage of time,” said Bénédicte de Montlaur, president and CEO of the World Monuments Fund. “The prize was created to call attention to these challenges and highlight exemplary preservation efforts around the world.”The architectural team from Brisbane-based Architectus Conrad Gargett conducted exhaustive research into all aspects of Mezzedimi’s original design. The entire facade was reglazed to improve the building’s energy efficiency and structural integrity, while the surrounding landscape was replanted with native African flora, and its splendid terraced fountains cleaned and refreshed.Mosaic tiles on the exterior had to be removed to address structural degradation, so 13 million new ones were fabricated, replicating the mosaics’ textured profile and colour schemes. More than 500 pieces of Mezzedimi’s distinctive furniture were restored and reinstated. The project also addressed seismic resilience, as earthquakes and volcanic activity are common in Ethiopia, and introduced new technology in ways that respect the building’s modernist character.At the heart of Africa Hall is Afewerk Tekle’s 1961 work, Total Liberation of Africa – a sumptuous stained glass triptych depicting scenes from the continent’s history. Rich in colour and allusion, it became a photogenic backdrop for visiting dignitaries to Ethiopia, including Britain’s late Queen Elizabeth II in 1965. Tekle had previously studied at London’s Slade School of Art, and travelled around Europe for two years, learning how to design and construct stained glass windows.View image in fullscreenAfrica Hall in 1966.Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Mondadori/Getty ImagesThe stained glass pieces were originally fabricated by the French artisan studio Atelier Thomas Vitraux; Emmanuel Thomas, the grandson of the original maker, was enlisted to help restore the panels. The thread of artistic connection from Africa Hall is further strengthened by Ethiopian American contemporary artist Julie Mehretu, who has drawn on Tekle’s work for her own monumental stained glass project at the Obama Presidential Centre, due to open later this year in Chicago.“Africa Hall stands as one of the most important expressions of modern architecture on the continent, a building that brought together international ideas and local identity at a pivotal moment in the region’s history of decolonisation,” said Barry Bergdoll, the American architectural historian and curator who chaired the prize jury.“[Its] restoration has allowed the clarity of Mezzedimi’s design to speak again, revealing the ambition, craftsmanship and symbolic power that have made the building a landmark of modernism and a continuing stage for African diplomacy.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureEthiopiaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now his banging pop miniatures have been streamed nearly 30m times – and are making parents cryTim JonzeMon 16 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleI’m listening to the latest Stephen Spencer song when suddenly I burst into tears. Was it the falsetto vocals? The swirling harmonies? No, it was the lyrics: “What did Apple-the-Stoola say? He said ‘I love you’ twenty-sixty times.”Spencer, you see, has a unique lyrical collaborator: his three-year-old daughter. Over the last four months, he has been posting short songs online based on her stream-of-consciousness stories. There’s a smooth soul number about “a regular rabbit, who has regular ponytails just like me”. A song called Funchy the Snow-woman that could fit easily on to a 1975 album, but for its lyrical message about using a litter tray in the forest. And a festive tune about a Christmas cat called Harda Tarda, who hopes that Taja (“a funny way to say Santa”) will bring her “a doggy, a puppy and a ninja-bread man”.I think the songs resonate with the parents of children who miss the days when they were threeWhen he started posting his songs, Spencer had 36 followers. “They were really just for my mom and her book club.” He now has more than 250,000 and his songs have been listened to an astonishing 23m times on Instagram and 5m times on TikTok. There have been demands to turn these minute-long mini-masterpieces into full-length versions for an album. “I’m hesitant to try to stretch them in a way that might spoil the magic of those captured moments,” he says. But there are plans to release something in longer form. A Spotify release of Regular Rabbit is set for this week.On first listen, the songs are funny and cute, a welcome respite from the tumult in the world. But they’re also absolute bangers. Spencer – who was in a funk band at school in Ottawa and is now professor of composition and music theory at Hunter College in New York City – is incredibly adept at crafting hooks that won’t leave your head. But what about the crying? Because I really did not expect that.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

I’ve always had a sense of wanting to bottle it because I know it will disappear soon. Music is my way of doing that.”This makes sense. My daughter is nine now and, although she still writes charming stories, the surreal character names and dream-logic plotlines have been replaced by more sensible tropes. Hearing Spencer’s songs takes me straight back to that giddy toddler period.But is it more than nostalgia? Spencer, 35, has noticed another surprising response to his work. He’s aware of the inherent humour in the contrast between his daughter’s flights of fancy and his meticulous approach to performing them seriously: the way he turns to the camera to sing passionately about, say, a dinosaur called Pasghetti is reminiscent of Flight of the Conchords. “But what I didn’t realise,” he says, “is how that would land, for so many people, as an act of love. Listening really closely to a child, taking care in understanding, trying to get the words right, no judgment, no correcting – that turned out to be really moving for some people.”Indeed, fans love the fact that characters in the songsgoedsomewhere rather than went, orfliedinstead of flew. “Some people have said that the songs touch them because they were never deeply listened to as a child,” says Spencer.While listeners compare his work to yacht rock, Spencer says his influences are jazz and classicalThe comments under his songs on Instagram (@_stephenspencer) can be as moving as the music. Under the one about Apple-the-Stoola (an apple man who is granted wings by a fairy so he can fly away and find his lost mum), a listener has posted: “I wish I could still tell my Mom I love you twenty-sixty times. She ‘flied away’ nine years ago. So if you still have a mom that is in your life, tell her ‘I love you’ twenty-sixty times.”“There’s this tendency to interpret her words in a profound way,” says Spencer, who chooses not to give his daughter’s name. This is not entirely accidental. Spencer picks out phrases from the stories he thinks have the potential for deeper meaning and uses them for chorus refrains. In the Christmas cat song, Santa responds to present requests by saying: “I’ll give you everything.” Watching Spencer sing this, from the heart with his eyes closed, it’s clear that, although these are his daughter’s words, he’s really saying them back to her.It’s not his only clever musical trick. While listeners like to compare his work to yacht rock and other breezy 1970s genres, Spencer says his influences are jazz and classical. “In my theory classes, we often look at Beethoven. There might be a chord change in the development of a sonata where he will modulate to a foreign key. I try to use that same technique for my pre-choruses and bridges.”Has the growing audience added pressure and expectation to something that started out extremely pure? “I have to forget about that side, because what makes them work is how it’s about just hanging with my daughter and not taking life too seriously.”The songs normally come together over a couple of afternoons. Spencer will record her stories on his phone and, occasionally, go back for more details if he feels the verses need an extra syllable here or there. It’s a genuine artistic collaboration. So what does his lyricist make of the results? “It’s maybe a little disappointing as an answer,” he says, laughing, “but from what I can tell, she couldn’t care less. Let’s just say she’s more focused on the process than the product.”A true artist then! “Exactly. I’ve told her 20 million people have listened, but that’s not really a meaningful number to her. Put it like this: she thinks I’m seven.”Regular Rabbit (Living Room Version) is released on streaming platforms on 17 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsMusicChildrenParents and parentingFamilyPop and rockSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it a giant’s golf ball? An alien spacecraft? A fallen planet?Twelve metres in diameter, the Niemeyer Sphere is the final design of world-famous Brazilian architectOscar Niemeyerand probably the most surprising creation by a visionary who valued the sensation of newness in art above all else, the result being mesmerising buildings that seem both space age and out of this world. The Sphere is like a vision from the future, dropped among used-car dealerships and construction equipment rental outlets, in a working-class neighbourhood that few tourists would ever pass through by design.We had this very good cook in the canteen – and he needed a space to deliver more refined dishesThe Sphere has only been open since June 2020, when its arrival was barely noticed due to Covid, but the journey from idea to inauguration took two decades. Throughout the construction process, photographer Margret Hoppe documented its various elaborate stages. The Spirit of Past Future, an exhibition of her shots, has just opened in the building, also featuring work by Armenian artist Nvard Yerkanian.This exhibition tells the story of modernist architecture, including artful photographs of Bauhaus structures, which Niemeyer found too rules-based, and buildings by Le Corbusier, who employed the young, not-yet-famous Brazilian architect as a draftsman at the beginning of his career. The Niemeyer Sphere crowns that career.View image in fullscreen‘Like walk-in sunglasses’ … the individually crafted liquid crystal glass panels.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyIts storybegins in 1994, when publicly owned East German companies were being essentially gifted to private buyers. West German entrepreneur Ludwig Koehne bought a heavy machinery factory for the symbolic fee of one Deutsche Mark. He changed its name to Techne Sphere.“We had this very good cook in the workers’ canteen,” says Koehne. “It was always clear to me that he needed a space where we could do events and deliver more refined dishes.” Koehne envisioned a restaurant on the roof of the two-storey canteen, which could use the existing kitchen’s facilities to cook and wash up.In 2007, Koehne took a business trip to Brazil, where he fell in love with Niemeyer’s ravishing Brasília buildings – from the Palace of the Dawn, the water-fronted modernist residence of the president, to the Cathedral of Brasília, a crown-shaped concrete-and-glass wonder that seems to reach for the heavens. Four years later, Koehne wrote a letter to Niemeyer and went back to Brazil to meet the architect in person. Upon his return, he asked Tibor Herzigkeit – the chef and owner of the canteen – to commit to staying on for at least 10 more years. Herzigkeit agreed.View image in fullscreenNiemeyer’s genius … the Niterói Contemporary Art Museum in Rio de Janiero.Photograph: Donatas Dabravolskas/AlamyNiemeyer was 103 when he drew the first sketch, a round ball with windows at the top and bottom. When he died a year later, in 2012, he hadn’t finalised the design, but left behind a lot of material. “It had to be true to his spirit,” says Koehne. “It’s a great honour to get such a nice drawing, as a small company with just old rooftops to play with. And I really felt obliged to do it because of that.”To flesh out the original concept, Koehne and executive architect Harald Kern brought in Jair Valera, who had worked as Niemeyer’s right-hand man for decades. After more planning, testing and hiring the right companies, they laid the foundation stone in 2017. Structural engineering, construction and materials each presented their own challenges, but the south-west-facing windows posed a huge conundrum. Koehne wanted the space to be aesthetically pleasing and physically comfortable, from light to ambience to temperature. “The fear of getting overheated in summer was very high,” says Kern. The team sought “invisible shading that goes with the Niemeyer architecture”.Merck, the company behind the windows, developed the technology while the rest of the project unfolded. Their liquid crystal glass was not ready until 2019, at which point the company individually crafted each of the unique 144 triangular panes which, says Kern, can be dimmed from “a nice and neutral soft gray to a nearly dark black”.View image in fullscreenWater-fronted wonder … the Palace of the Dawn in Brasília.Photograph: Evaristo Sa/AFP/Getty ImagesNiemeyer, in hisacceptance speechfor the prestigious Pritzker prize in 1988, said: “A concern for beauty, a zest for fantasy, and an ever-present element of surprise, bear witness that today’s architecture is not a minor craft bound to straight-edge rules, but imbued with technology: light, creative and unfettered.”Challenging the wisdom that buildings should function like machines, Niemeyer pioneered the use of curves and rounded shapes, taking inspiration from natural surroundings. The circular cathedral’s interior, which can hold 4,000 people, has 16 white concrete columns that curve in and then out, holding up a glass ceiling.Throughout his career, concrete and glass remained Niemeyer’s signature materials: stained-glass windows fill the spaces between the columns in river-like swaths of blue and green, surrounded by panes in lighter shades. Despite the weight of these materials, Niemeyer consistently produced an illusion of lightness or even floating.View image in fullscreenRevered worldwide … Niemeyer in his office at the age of 95.Photograph: Reuter/REUTERSThe Niemeyer Sphere follows this tradition: white concrete and dark windows by day, with brightly lit windows against shadowy concrete at night. The dimming properties of the glass also protect against glare. “They’re like walk-in sunglasses,” says Koehne. “As the eyes adjust to the relative darkness of the facade, and the pupils open a little, you see things in the clouds you’ve never seen. That’s part of the experience of spending an evening dining here. You really experience the sky.”Niemeyer always engaged with new technologies, such as when he built the Obra do Berço nursery in Rio de Janeiro in the late 1930s with panels that can move horizontally to open on cooler days, to let sunshine in, and close in the middle of summer, to keep it out. Valera and Kern believe Niemeyer would have liked these liquid crystals, which offer much the same functionality in a sleeker design.In addition to the Sphere, the factory complex boasts two further art galleries in other buildings and hosts the occasional outdoor concert. The Niemeyer Sphere’s opening ceremony included the performance of a cello suite by Johann Sebastian Bach, arguably the city’s most famous citizen.View image in fullscreenSpace age … the National Museum of the Republic in Brasília.Photograph: AGB Photo Library/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesInside, the concrete-and-glass ball has three levels. The bottom, inaccessible to guests, is the technical area. Visitors enter the Sphere on the middle floor and step into a bar serving kombucha and gin. The curved window descends below the floor, with those triangular glass panes appropriately dimmed from a digital device – the same technology used on modern aircraft in lieu of blinds.On the top floor, the pampered guests gather on cushioned designer chairs to enjoy a drink while gazing out over the rooftops. The interior wall displays a drawing by Niemeyer, red lines on a light background, the sort of flourish the architect added to buildings throughout his career. And this, his final project, combines all of his artistic interests, from curves to surprise.“In this project, Oscar was looking for simplification,” Valera said at the opening. “This simplification arises not by reducing elements, but through striving for elegance and extraordinary lightness – which are so characteristic of his work.”The Spirit of Past Futureis at Techne Sphere Leipzig until 22 MarchExplore more on these topicsArchitectureGermanyOscar NiemeyerEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The platform is now host to reams of content that violate its own guidelines.According to developers who spoke with the Guardian, abuse – particularly directed towards transgender creators – is a fact of life on the platform. “Everyone is at one another’s throats all the time in reviews, discussions, forums, anywhere you can possibly find it on Steam,” says content creator and Steam curator Bri “BlondePizza” Moore. “It ensures no one is safe on the platform; developers and consumers alike.”Aside from the content of Steam’s forums, sources pointed to two main causes for concern: bigoted reviews posted on games’ Steam pages, which can hugely affect sales for their developers; and Steam curators (self-appointed taste-makers on the platform) directing campaigns against games they perceive to lean left or pursue inclusion.“I’m not new to online harassment,” says designer Nathalie Lawhead, who spent two years trying to get reviews removed from their games’ pages.Bothreferenceallegations of sexual assaultthat Lawhead made in 2019. “I assumed reporting Steam abuse might have its own issues. But when people suggested that I open a ticket, I did have hope that this would be the way to get it resolved.”Valve’s refusal to moderate is making Steam reviews and forums the battleground for a culture warÉmi Lefèvre, Studio Plane ToastOne of the reviews, published in 2023, read, “cringe game, made by a liar”. The other, a review of Lawhead’s game Blue Suburbia posted in 2024, said: “A women [sic] who seeks to destroy other’s [sic] career made this. It’s very poorly put together. She also probably has dual Israeli citizenship with how pointy her nose is.”Despite Steam’scode of online conductandcommunity guidelinesprohibiting “abusive language or insults”, public accusations or “discrimination”, moderators initially cleared both reviews after Lawhead reported them.View image in fullscreenA ‘No Woke’ curation list on Steam, where reviewers target games with LGBTQ+ characters.Photograph: SteamSteam does not allow cleared content to be reported again by the same user unless it has been edited. So Lawhead asked others on social media to report the reviews, which prompted Steam to remove the antisemitic example. The other, however, was passed again. “We aren’t in a position to verify the accuracy of statements made in user reviews,” reads a response from Steamsent on 9 January 2026, “and we don’t try to moderate reviews based on accuracy.” Removing reviews, the response claimed, could be seen as “censorship”.“Crushing,” is how Lawhead describes Steam’s missive. “The implication seems to be that I must prove my sexual assault [to Steam] if I want to be protected from harassment over it,” they say. “I am hard-pressed to see where the misunderstanding might be. They had all the information regarding the situation. It’s an obvious stance. It’s a choice.”The remaining review was finally removed, but only after Lawhead personally approached an employee of Steam’s developer, Valve, outside the moderation ecosystem. “This was too much work just for two obviously unjustifiable reviews,” they say, describing having to resolve the issue outside the usual channels as awkward for both parties. “I think this entire process of moderation is broken.”While Lawhead was able to call on public support to help get reviews removed, that is not an option for every developer: not everyone has enough of a following. Others who have gone public with Steam moderation issues have received further harassment, and have asked to speak anonymously or be identified by their first names only.View image in fullscreenCaravan SandWitch, criticised as ‘Too LGBTQ’ in one review.Photograph: Studio Plane ToastSome games have been targeted by Steam curators. Ethan, the developer ofCoven, a first-person action-horror set in the 1600s, says he has been targeted by “CharlieTweetsDetected”, a curator devoted to recommending games based solely on whether their developers are perceived to have correctly mourned the assassination of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk.CharlieTweetsDetected’s review of Coven, a first-person action-horror game set in the 1600s, read simply “Celebrated Sept 10th on blue sky [sic]”. This encouraged others to post further reviews and comments related to Kirk (and not the game). “I even mentioned it to Steam support,” Ethan says, “how it stemmed from that curator list, but they weren’t interested.” Instead, Steam support claimed that “off-topic” constituted “a recipe for cookies, or something completely unrelated to video games that is clearly trolling.” Reviews referencing Kirk, including one reading simply “RIP Charlie Kirk” alongside a negative rating, did not fit that criteria according to Steam;all remain in place today.Elsewhere, campaigns chase games that include trans or LGBTQ+ characters. A trans developer included on acuration list titled “NO WOKE”cites frequent discussion threads, including one that referred to them as a “transvestite” and asked whether their game included “woke faggotry.” Plane Toast’s Émi Lefèvre points toreviewsand discussionsof Caravan SandWitch, a sci-fi action-adventure and driving game, which frequently approach its queer characters negatively. “Too LBGTQ [sic] … There is no future or continuation for these sad gays and lesbians,”reads oneamong many that remain visible on the game’s store page.“For sure, the ‘anti-woke’ curators brought insincere negative attention to the game,” Lefèvre says. “Valve’s refusal to moderate any of this is making Steam reviews and forums the battleground for some kind of culture war, and is making them unsafe for marginalised people and regular gamers trying to simply enjoy the game they bought.”‘Brown space lesbians’ ended up the hardest line in our marketing copyChristina Pollock, developer of Ambrosia SkyThanks to this influx of bad actors, and the lengths that developers need to go to in the hopes of getting hateful content removed from their pages, often without success, many report feeling held hostage by the platform. Steam has becomeessential for developers. It brings in millions of daily users – last monthit had almost 42 million concurrent players– and billions of dollars. “No other storefront has the clout that Steam does,” Lawhead says. “Publishers don’t take you seriously if you’re not on it.”That level of success results inhundreds of thousands of support ticketsevery week. Details about how Valve, a company that hasbeen reported to employ fewer than 400 people, handles its moderation load are elusive. Online consensus, including amongthose formerly involved in Steam’s volunteer moderation programme(retired in 2022), is that the process must be outsourced. The Guardian reached out to Valve on multiple occasions, through multiple channels, for more information and for comment on why moderators clear so many apparent violations of Steam’s guidelines. Valve did not respond to those requests, nor has it made any public comment that the Guardian could find on Steam’s moderation issues.Developer Phi endured an identical process to Ethan and Lawhead upon releasing Heart of Enya in 2021. After escalating a support ticket overtransphobic reviews, Phi received the following response from a Steam agent: “It’s much better to continue working on the product, while letting the community use the helpfulness feature to surface reviews that they agree with or find to be uninformed.” (This exact wording was in Steam support’s response to Lawhead five years later.) “Most of our moderating decisions come down to a yes/no criteria … that’s a frustrating line to walk, and I think it inevitably leaves content that would be considered offensive.”The agent suggested the issue would be discussed with their team, but after five years little appears to have changed.View image in fullscreenTying to contain a fungal outbreak … Ambrosia Sky.Photograph: Soft Rains“To us, it seemed that in Steam’s [view], hateful comments about an individual is abuse – but targeting it towards a group of people is totally fine, that’s welcome speech,” Phi says. “We had no other choice for what to do about transphobia in our reviews. They’re still up there today.”Recourse for developers is limited. Some are looking into their own security, shoring up protections for developers on their team against being doxxed or hacked by trolls. Or, in the case of the developers of Caves of Qud, paying their own moderators to handle forums and the hate that spills out of Steam. Others push bigoted comments into public view in an attempt to cajole Valve, such as No More Robots head Mike Rose, whopushed back against racist reviews of its game Little Rocket Lablast year. “Woke game. Also has muslims,” reads one negative review; “please never, ever play any of our games ever again,” reads Rose’s response.Others are just trying to roll with it. “Brown space lesbians trying and failing to contain a simple fungal outbreak” is, despite its original derogatory intent, “the hardest line in all of our marketing copy”, according toAmbrosia Skydeveloper Christina Pollock.It is increasingly easy, however, for the average consumer to log on to Steam and encounter abuse, bigotry and hate, much of which has been cleared by moderators. And because reviews affect a game’s visibility on Steam, a single negative rating can mean the difference between success and failure. Lax moderation doesn’t just create individual harm but has profound professional and economic implications for developers across the platform.Many of them say they feel forced simply to endure it – unable to walk away from Steam’s near-monopoly onPCgaming. “If I am to continue existing on Steam, I am under the impression that I will have to go through this exhausting ordeal every time I want to report abuse,” Lawhead concludes. “This shouldn’t be normal.”Explore more on these topicsSteamPCGamesRaceLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That weekend, the boy had been at A&E after an attempt at self-harm, and in his notes the hospital doctor had recommended the teenager be prescribed antidepressants. “I thought: ‘Wait a minute, I can’t just start a 16-year-old on antidepressants,’” says Chatterjee. He wanted to understand what was going on in the boy’s life.They talked for a while, and Chatterjee asked him about his screen use, which turned out to be high. “I said: ‘I think your screen use, particularly in the evenings, might be impacting your mental wellbeing.’” Chatterjee helped the boy and his mother set up a routine where digital devices and social media went off an hour before bed, gradually extending the screen-free period over six weeks. After two months, he says the boy stopped needing to see him. A few months after that, his mother wrote Chatterjee a note to say her son had been transformed – he was engaging with his friends and trying new activities. He was, she said, like a different boy from the one who had ended up in hospital.Chatterjee believes that “the widespread adoption of screens into our children’s lives is the most urgent public health issue of our time”. He was never very political, he says. He is the affable host of a successful health podcast,Feel Better, Live More, and his books strike an optimistic, inspiring tone – but on this issue he is passionate, his frustration obvious. “I think successive governments have been very weak here, and they are failing a whole generation of children. I think they’ve already failed a generation of children.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m not judging parents.’Photograph: Posed by model; Olga Dobrovolska/Getty ImagesChatterjee saw that young patient more than 10 years ago, and since then children’s screen use has soared. To clinicians, he says, the harm “has been obvious for over a decade”. This has led to a swell of action, fromAustralia’s social media ban for under-16sto Spain’s just-announced plans for one. In the UK, grassroots parents’ organisations such asSmartphone Free ChildhoodandSafeScreenswant the UK to follow suit. Chatterjee, who is involved with campaign organisationClose Screens Open Mindsover the proliferation of “ed tech” in schools, believes the legal age for using social media should be 18, as with gambling and access to pornography. “As a society, we have safeguards in place to protect children,” Chatterjee says. “At the moment, we are in the middle of a widespread experiment that no one consciously signed up to.”Tech bosses, he says, have had too much influence over deciding “what’s best for our children. If we’re expecting Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg to regulate technology better for our children’s wellbeing, we’re being, frankly, delusional. Their whole business model wants more people on their devices for longer.” Adults struggle with screen use, he points out. “Our children have got no chance. Their prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain where we exercise rational decision-making, is not fully developed till the age of 25.”Every additional hour of screen time increases the risk of myopia by 21% in childrenHe rattles off the harms, which include the effect on children’s mental health and anxiety. “We know it’s affecting their sleep.” It isaffecting posture, and causes neck and shoulder pain. For younger children, it causes language delay. “There’s research coming out now saying it’saffecting their eyesight. Every additional hour of screen time increases the risk of myopia by 21% and in children already diagnosed with myopia, an extra hour increases risk of progression by 54%. I think we’re raising a generation of children who have low self-worth, who don’t know how to conduct conversations. The content children have been exposed to is really alarming –10% of nine-year-olds have seen pornography, and 27% of 11-year-olds.” He adds that there is a strong chance that the first time someone goes on a pornographic website, they will be served images of violence: one French study found thatup to 90% of online pornfeatured verbal, physical and sexual violence against women.We’re speaking over video call, Chatterjee at his home studio where he makes his podcast. He barely stops for breath. He is warm and likable, and seems to have the supreme self-assurance that all successful podcasters develop. But he stresses that he doesn’t blame parents (or teachers, who are dealing with the encroachment of “ed tech”, the increased use of devices and software, in schools). Screen use is higher in children in lower socioeconomic groups. “People are living stressed-out lives. There are a lot of families who are struggling with the cost of living.” Screens are, he says, “an easy babysitter. And I say it with compassion, I get that.”View image in fullscreenScreen-based homework ‘should be abolished immediately’, says Chatterjee.Photograph: Posed by model; MoMo Productions/Getty ImagesChatterjee’s own children are 13 and 15. They have smartphones, but with almost all apps, including the internet browser, disabled. They are not allowed to access social media. “I’m not judging other parents, because I do understand the pressures. For me, because I’ve seen so many suicidal, depressed, anxious teenagers – and I could directly see a correlation between that and their screen and social media use – I thought I cannot allow my children on to these platforms.”He and his wife have always had open conversations with their children and he says: “So far, it’s been fine. But I think they may be the only two kids in their school not on social media. It’s very hard for most parents to do that.” Chatterjee has already complained to the headteacher about screen-based homework, which “should be abolished immediately”. Bright light from screens in the evening, he says, is wreaking havoc on teenagers’ sleep. He is always turning down the screen brightness on his kids’ laptops when they’re doing homework, and screens have to go off at least an hour before bed.Chatterjee stopped practising as a GP nearly two years ago. He misses it, he says, but he realised he could reach many more people with his broadcasting work than he could with 10-minute appointments at his surgery (he is also visiting professor of health education and communication at the University of Chester). His broadcasting career took off after he made the2015 BBC series Doctor in the House, and now his podcast has had more than 350m listens, with 1.3 million subscribers to his YouTube channel. He is a big advocate of lifestyle change, which gives Chatterjee something of a holistic air.View image in fullscreenChatterjee with, from left, Serena, Pratiksha, and Sandeep in the BBC TV series Doctor in the House in 2015.Photograph: Jude Edgington/BBC/Studio LambertI’m a fan of his podcast, though I switch off when he gives airtime to “experts” who sit at the wackier end of the spectrum, such as Joe Dispenza, who advocates manifestation, says woolly things about how energy and the “quantum field” can cure disease, and claims to have healed his broken back using thought. Chatterjee says he decided to pause practising medicine and put his attention instead to raising awareness because: “We’re in a health landscape now where 80 to 90% of what doctors see is driven by our collective modern lifestyles … Whether we’re talking about obesity, type 2 diabetes, anxiety, depression, insomnia, these things are downstream from the way we live our lives.”Chatterjee had become increasingly frustrated that theNHSwasn’t geared up for preventive health. “If you’ve had a heart attack, if you’ve been knocked down in the road, you don’t want lifestyle change, you want the best in modern medicine.” But for many of the health problems doctors see these days, Chatterjee thinks we need a different approach. “Are doctors the best people to see some of the issues that are coming in if they’re driven by lifestyle? What would it look like if every NHS practice in the country had two or three health coaches who also worked there? We need a new approach for prevention.” (This might be the moment to add that Chatterjee is about to launch an individualised programme offering blood tests and health coaching, yours for £249 a year.) What he would like to see is the NHS separated from politics. “If we’re really going to transform it, we need a 30-year plan, not a five-year plan.”Chatterjee’s late father, Tarun, was a doctor who came to the UK in 1962 from India to work in the NHS (his mother followed about 10 years later). In Chatterjee’s latest book,Happy Mind, Happy Life, he wrote about the racism his father faced in his career. “My dad’s mentality, which I think is common in a certain generation of immigrants from India in the 1960s, is we don’t complain, we put our head down and get on with things.” Tarun had worked in obstetrics and gynaecology, and was a skilled surgeon who trained other doctors – people who, year after year, were promoted to consultant positions ahead of him. To become a consultant, he had to move to the less popular specialism of genitourinary medicine.View image in fullscreen‘We need a new approach for prevention’ … Chatterjee at the podcast microphone.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianChatterjee remembers his father working relentlessly. “People like my dad are a net positive to this country. He worked as a consultant in the day, he did GP house calls at night. He worked hard, he paid taxes.” It’s the same all over the NHS, he says. “There are so many phenomenal staff who have come from overseas.”For most of his life, Chatterjee says he absorbed his dad’s mentality: “You don’t complain, you just get on with things.” In late 2018, however, at a meeting at his publishing house, someone (not an employee of the publisher) said that a major retailer had not stocked his first book because “they already had a book on their shelves by an Indian doctor. I remember hearing it. I didn’t say anything. I felt uncomfortable, I think a few people felt uncomfortable, but we just continued our meeting.” He went over it on the train home. The term “Indian doctor” is not accurate. “I was born and brought up in the UK. There was a lot of guilt and shame that came up for me when I thought: I didn’t say anything.” (He did later bring it up with his publisher.)‘Each year you delay giving a phone is a big win’: child screen-time solutions from around the worldRead more“I don’t think people understand, unless you’ve faced discrimination or you’re maybe from an immigrant family, how toxic some of this language is,” says Chatterjee. “The stuff that I’m seeing now on social media, I’m thinking, are we really seeing this in 2026? But we’ve now got political figures all over the world who are very happy to say inflammatory things, which then gives members of the public licence to go: ‘If the person in charge is talking about things this way, I can talk about things this way.’” He is an optimist, he says. “I always believe in humanity, that things will be OK, but I don’t like some of the things that are going on at the moment.”Chatterjee moved back to his home town of Wilmslow, Cheshire, to help care for his father, who was diagnosed with lupus in his late 50s, which caused kidney failure. When his father died in 2013, “that was a massive, significant moment for me, like it is for many people”. He started to re-evaluate his life. He remembers his childhood as very happy, but it was also – familiar to many children of immigrant parents – typified by a pressure to succeed. “If I ever got 19 out of 20 in a test, their first question was always: ‘What did you get wrong?’View image in fullscreen‘The No 1 factor for long-term health, happiness and longevity is the quality of your relationships.’Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“I don’t want this to come across as blaming my parents. Back then, there was quite a lot of discrimination and the way their child doesn’t have to face the struggles they had is to be a straight-A student. I get that, but I think I took on, as a child, the belief that I was only really loved if I got top grades. On one hand, that’s great, it drives you to work hard, you go into a prestigious profession. But I realised that for all my so-called success, I wasn’t actually that happy or content.”He started to separate his sense of self-worth from his achievements. “I realised that where my happiness comes from is the unmeasurables in life.” This was in looking after his father, and now his mother, who lives five minutes away and whom he sees most days.“I’m happily married for 18 years. I’ve got children who I spend a lot of quality time with.” He’s not saying that to sound superior, he says. “I’m saying I’ve understood that actually, I’m prepared to have less ‘societal success’ if necessary, in order to make sure my relationships with my mum, my wife, my children, my friends, are front and centre. We know from the research that the No 1 factor for long-term health, happiness and longevity is the quality of your relationships.”As a child psychiatrist, I see what smartphones are doing to kids’ mental health – and it’s terrifying | Emily SehmerRead moreThere isn’t, he says, “a scorecard for that. I really think we get seduced in the modern world by metrics.”At 48, he says, he has never been happier. After a lot of “inner work”, Chatterjee has identified his values, and tries to live by them, which sounds as if he has been spending too much time with American wellbeing podcasters, even if it also makes sense.“I think the more aligned you get, the more you start to live in harmony with your values,” he says, “the easier life becomes.” Sometimes his work-life balance isn’t right, and his main health vice is coffee. “If you’d asked me six or seven years ago, I would say, when I’m stressed, I will go to sugar. It wasn’t that I didn’t know about the problems with excess sugar use, but knowledge isn’t what we need. A lot of these behaviours come as a way of soothing emotions.”He brings the conversation back to what screen use is doing to all of us, but especially to children. “One thing I worry about is that we start to lose touch with our emotions and how we feel. We’re distracted constantly. And everything good in our lives comes from our ability to be present – our relationships, how we feel about ourselves. We have to be able to be present. And these devices are training distraction.”Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe big interviewGPsSmartphonesHealthHealthcare industryMental healthChildreninterviewsShareReuse this content"

What quickly became apparent, during the routine humiliation of our puppy training classes, was that Otto was a law unto himself.“He’s not normal” quickly became a stock family phrase, as Otto demonstrated a series of wild, mischievous and outlandish behaviours. During classes, I remember being told euphemistically that he was “wilful” and shamefully resorted to hiding cocktail sausages in my pockets during the final exam to encourage a modicum of civility in him. It just about worked.He was very hairy, with astonishingly soft ears and a tail that was constantly swishing with delight. Other dogs might gently curl up on the sofa; Otto would sit like a human on his rump, two paws up in the air. Other dogs would splash in the water; Otto would submerge and roll. Other dogs retrieved Frisbees; Otto found dead badgers. The resident court jester in our neighbourhood, he knew how to turn heads.But when he wasn’t acting like a loon, he was also utterly sweet and incapable of walking past a stranger without befriending them. Nothing gave me more immediate happiness than opening the front door to see him thundering down the stairs, tail thrashing vigorously and knocking down countless items in his haste to reunite with me.View image in fullscreen‘He knew how to turn heads’ … Otto.Photograph: Clara Mead-RobsonWhen I was away at university my mum broke her foot, so we joined BorrowMyDoggy, a website that links dog owners with local people looking to walk dogs. Otto quickly ended up with a team of devoted walkers, and in the course of his 10 years “befriended” more than 20 dogless humans. He loved each of them in turn and added immensely to their lives too.As he became older and inevitably arthritic, he would plod alongside me on our walks. Strangers would pause, pat his big head and tell me how well-trained he was. I would smile graciously and thank them, taking credit where I knew it wasn’t due. Had his ageing body not betrayed him he would have been off helping himself to the nearest picnic.He was by our sides through illness, breakups and weddings, and when we lost him our grief felt bottomless. On his final day, I released every tennis ball we had all at once in a huge cascade around his head. Despite being so unwell, he was thrilled. I suspect he had stolen most of them from the park.Otto’s charm was that he got us to see the world as dogs do – and what a kind, joyful species they are. How lucky we are to have them.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe pet I'll never forgetDogsAnimalsPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Parenting expert Sally J Hall suggests getting creative in her guide tokeeping kids entertained during the holidays.“Buy a cheapscrapbookand use it to record memories. Stick in souvenirs: bus and train tickets, sweet packets, museum leaflets, things we found, pressed flowers, postcards – anything to remind us of places we visited,” she writes.

She also recommendsLego Monkey Palace(ages 10+) as a fun game that improves building and creativity skills. For a card game that will get everyone engaged,Uno Show ‘em No Mercy(ages 7+) is a more savage take on the classic game … be warned, it may result in sulking.For something to get them active while indoors, why not unleash their inner Marty Supreme with a set that will convert your dining table into aping-pong table?For getting outsideView image in fullscreenTrail finders: a walk in nature can feed little imaginations and provide material for a trail journal.Photograph: Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty ImagesIf the weather lets up, get the kids outside and excited about a walk with anature trail journal.

I wanted to be a fun mum, creating love-soaked memories and quirky family traditions for my children right from the get-go. I wanted to be Bluey’s parents before Bluey even existed.TheAustralian Women’s Weekly birthday cakeswere destined to be a pillar of my perfectly imperfect parenting rituals. One child quickly became three, andthat iconic recipe bookwas in constant rotation. In the early years, I would simply choose a cake that matched my very basic baking skills. I also only owned a round tin, so my kids’ early cakes were circle-shaped, or circle-adjacent: theswimming pool(a round cake filled with jelly), thecat(a round cake with ears) and therace track(two round cakes with the centres removed).My rookie era: on my first ski trip, I felt like a natural – then I was rapidly humbled by the mountainRead moreThree times a year, I would be reminded that I was not, in fact, a cake expert but a sleep-deprived mother fuelled by blind optimism, a packet of cake mix and zero useful utensils. As I attempted to create the perfect buttercream, I would curse my rookie naivety. Each birthday, I vowed to buy a proper icing knife or one of those fancy turntable thingies. I would then promptly forget this vow until the eve of the next birthday.But the children grew, and so did their opinions. They wanted to choose their own cakes. For 11 years, I had successfully dodged the infamous duck cake. Until my eldest’s most recent birthday.View image in fullscreen‘Let your kids choose any cake. Except the duck cake.’Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianAs yellow icing splattered across all kitchen surfaces, I questioned all my life choices while railing at the unfair expectations created by the AWW Test Kitchen. Was this some national prank? How was the head meant to remain attached to the body? Meanwhile, my eight-year-old provided live commentary.“Why is it so small, Mum?”, “Did you follow the instructions?”, and the most cutting remark of all: “It doesn’t really look like the one in the book.”My duck cake ended up about a third the size of the original. The chip beak sat askew and the eyes were positioned in a way that lent the duck a distinctly unhinged expression. By then, I had handed decorating duties over to my children and abandoned all hope. In a final, desperate flourish, I served the cake on a tub of blue jelly, as if that might distract from the small but significant problem that the head wasn’t fully attached to the body.View image in fullscreen‘Did you follow the instructions?’ asked writer Shannon Wong-Nizic’s eldest child.Photograph: Shannon Wong-NizicWhen I shared my attempt online, I discovered it has delighted and traumatised generations.

I now know what a crumb layer is, and I also know I will never perfect the AWW buttercream. I bake smarter not harder now, and buy my buttercream from the supermarket. Come March, I know I’ll be silently swearing about the palette knife I never bought, while gently nudging my daughter towards a round cake. The swimming pool? Maybe the Hickory Dickory watch?If my children ever ask for parenting advice, among my many pearls of wisdom will be this: “Let your kids choose any cake.

The texture is fantastic and, whisper it, they’re even better made in an air fryer. Yes, I finally got one and it’s fantastic. You do, however, have to cook them all in one layer, which, depending on the size of your air-fryer basket, might mean cooking them in multiple batches. It feels more efficient to make them all in one go, though, so I’ve provided oven timings below.Ginger sesame meatballs with rice and greensUse your favourite and the best-quality mince you can get – it makes a big difference to the flavour and feels like a real treat.Prep15 minCook25 minServes44cmpiece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated2garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated3 spring onions, trimmed and roughly chopped2tbsp sesame seeds10g coriander, leaves and tender stems50g freshwhite breadcrumbs(I just blitz whatever bread we have in)500gmince(chicken, lamb or vegan)1egg1tsp sea salt flakes2tbsp sesame oil3 pak choi, cut into quarters200g basmati rice400ml boiling waterFor the dressing100g smooth or crunchy peanut butter2tbsp soy sauce2tbsp rice-wine vinegar2 smallgarlic cloves, peeled and finely grated2cm piece ginger, peeled and finely grated1 small red chilli, finely choppedTip the ginger, garlic, spring onions, sesame seeds, coriander and breadcrumbs into a food processor and blitz to a rough paste. Add the mince, egg and salt, and blitz again briefly until evenly incorporated. (Alternatively, finely chop the spring onions and coriander by hand, then mix everything in a large bowl.)Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Divide and shape the meatball mixture into just larger than walnut-in-the-shell-sized balls, and transfer to a large roasting tin. Drizzle with half the sesame oil and gently turn the meatballs so they get coated in the oil. Dress the pak choi with the remaining oil, then arrange in between the meatballs – you want the meatballs on top, so they brown. Bake for 25 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through.Meanwhile, put the rice and boiling water in a microwaveable bowl (I use a large Pyrex one), cover with a tight-fitting lid or a snug plate, and cook in a microwave on a medium heat (in mine, it’s 600W out of a maximum 800W) for 11 minutes, then leave to stand for 10 minutes.Whisk all the dressing ingredients in a bowl, using a couple of tablespoons of water to loosen, if need be. Taste and adjust the soy and vinegar as needed, and set aside.Serve the meatballs, pak choi and rice hot, with the sauce alongside.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyMain courseDairy-freeChickenHerbs and spicesrecipesShareReuse this content"

This dish takes the classic elements of a puttanesca – that is, anchovies, capers, olives, tomatoes – and combines them into a rich sauce for gnocchi, which are then covered in mozzarella, breadcrumbs and parmesan, and flashed under the grill. It’s exactly what you want on a rainy night. In fact, my sauce-averse toddler thought it smelled so good that she stole half of my plate – a win all round. (Although her pretty decent suggestion was that next time I use it as a pizza sauce, rather than on pasta or gnocchi. Noted.)Crispy baked gnocchi puttanescaI’ve non-canonically added in small cubes of aubergine, because they melt beautifully into the sauce while adding extra plant matter. To make this vegetarian, omit the anchovies, add an extra spoon of capers and use a vegetarian parmesan.Prep15 minCook30 minServes2 adults and2 small children2tbsp olive oil1 onion, peeled and finely chopped1 medium aubergine, trimmed and cut into 1cm dice½tsp flaky sea salt2garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated2tsp small capers in brine, drained1tsp anchovies in oil(about five small fillets)75g black olives, drained400g tinned chopped tomatoes500g fresh chilled or vacuum-packed gnocchi150g ball mozzarella, roughly torn40g white or panko breadcrumbs40g parmesanHeat the oil in a large, ovenproof frying pan or casserole, then add the onion and stir-fry on a medium to high heat for five minutes, until just starting to soften. Add the aubergine and salt, and cook, stirring frequently, for a further 10 minutes, until the aubergine has started to soften and brown.Add the garlic, capers, anchovies and olives, and stir-fry for 30 seconds, mashing the anchovies well. Add the tinned tomatoes, bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. (Note: it helps to use a good brand of tinned tomatoes here – Mutti’s are fantastic. Other brands may take a little longer to thicken sufficiently.)Just before the sauce is ready, bring a large pan of water to a boil, then drop in the gnocchi and cook according to the packet instructions (usually on a rolling boil for two to three minutes). Drain well, then stir the gnocchi through the sauce.Heat the grill to medium-high. Scatter the mozzarella all over the gnocchi. Mix the breadcrumbs and parmesan in a bowl, then scatter this over the mozzarella. Grill for three to five minutes, until the cheese has melted and the breadcrumbs and parmesan are well-browned, then serve hot.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyPastaMain courseTomatoesCheeseItalian food and drinkVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

It said no parking is allowed on the site between 9pmand6am.There were no signs on the EV charger explaining this, but Ocean has rejected my representation. Mer apologised for the “inconvenience”, but it will not help.DT,Redhill, SurreyThis is one of the most farcical parking disputes I’ve come across. Mer’s website advertises the EV charger as a 24-hour facility. Signs at the entrance to Redhill retail park state, in large letters, that free parking for up to two hours is allowed. Smaller print beneath this says that terms and conditions apply.It’s these terms and conditions that Ocean is relying on, and they are not printed on the entrance signs, or on the sign behind the EV charger.The latter notice bears a line, in a tiny font, obscured by the cable frame, advising drivers to check any parking restrictions. These restrictions are detailed on separate signs around the car park.I began with Mer. It was defensive, insisting that the sign on its charger was adequate, but admitted that the 24-hour promise on its website had caused “confusion”. It has now amended the website. Ocean’s defence was that it had no idea that the charger was in operation until I got in touch, and it had therefore assumed you were merely parking.This is unconvincing. You had detailed in your representation that you were using the charger at the time, and Ocean’s rejection letter stated users of the charger are not exempt from parking restrictions.I jogged Ocean’s memory, but it doubled down. “We maintain that the parking charges were issued correctly under the published conditions,” it said.“However, given that signage in the immediate charging area only met the minimum standard, and Ocean Parking pride themselves on exceeding that, we have taken a pragmatic and fair‑minded approach: all outstanding PCNs relating to that specific location were cancelled, appeals were upheld, and refunds were offered to motorists who had already paid.”In Leicestershire,CHis also caught in the tentacles of a private parking operator after stopping on a road in a business park to drink a cup of coffee. He was slapped with a £100 PCN by Euro Parking Services for parking on “double yellow lines/crosshatched bay” in a “restricted area”. He appealed and was asked to provide evidence that the restrictions were invisibly advertised. So back he went to the site to take photographs.EPS’s response was to fire off another £100 PCN. The CCTV photos attached to this second PCN show him craning to snap a tiny sign, with tiny print, mounted on a pole at least three metres (10ft) high. The photos also show that there are no yellow lines or hatchings on the road.EPS is a member of the trade body International Parking Community (IPC), whose code of practice requires signs to be conspicuous and legible. Member firms must also allow drivers a five-minute grace period to check for parking restrictions.The sign in EPS’s own photos is manifestly not conspicuous nor legible, and its PCN confirms he was on site for 75 seconds, yet EPS refused to cancel either PCN.EPS relented over the second charge when I questioned it, but insisted on upholding the first. “We recognise that drivers need to be able to read and, if necessary, photograph signs in order to submit a representation, and it is not our policy to penalise motorists for doing so,” said the firm which had done exactly thatWe are reviewing the signage at this site to ensure that it is clear, legible and appropriately positioned for all drivers,” it said.CH can appeal to the IPC, but if he loses, he also loses an early payment discount of £40.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.Email us atconsumer.champions@theguardian.comor write to Consumer Champions, Money, the Guardian, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Then one day I found £20 in the street and shifted my thinkingMaybelle MorganMon 16 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleGrowing up, I was envious of one type of person. It was never the kids who were smarter, sportier or more popular. My awe was reserved for a rarer breed of people: optimists. I was hypersensitive to the ease with which they sailed through exams, social gatherings or teenage milestones with a sunny conviction that things would more or less work out. To me, they were the chosen people. “It’ll be fine,” one such friend would reassure me. “Or you could embarrass yourself,” my mind would purr like a villain. “Be rejected. Fail.”I was a chronic worrier. A negative Nancy. I couldn’t fathom that people’s brains weren’t hardwired to compulsively fear things might go wrong. I grew up as the eldest daughter in a turbulent household where my father’s moods would plummet quickly and I walked on a knife-edge. Every morning, the second my eyes opened, I would force myself to accept it was going to be a bad day – an act of self-preservation so the rug could never get pulled from under my feet hoping for better. My thinking was that if you always expected the worst, things had a tendency to turn out better than you imagined.It intensified in adulthood, even long after my incredible stepfather came along, and my mum, my brother and I moved in with him. Before a date, a job interview, or a presentation, I’d tell myself it wasn’t going to go well. If the opposite was true I’d convince myself it was a one-off fluke. Ruminating on worst-case scenarios would keep me up at night. In therapy I learned I was prone to catastrophising and while things like exercise, journalling and meditation helped over the years, it flared up at times of stress.Early last year, everything changed when I found a £20 note on the ground, crumpled up in the gutter. I pocketed it. I didn’t want to forget how fortuitous it felt, so I wrote it down in my notes app. Later, as I walked up to a traffic crossing, the light turned green, as did the two directly after. It was such a funny Truman Show-esque moment, I jotted it down again.From that day on I began to make a list of every single good thing that happened to me, big or small. A train pulling in just as I got to the platform. A neighbour bringing over a slice of cake. Discovering I had an umbrella in my bag on a rainy day. Being invited on a work trip to a place I’d always wanted to visit. All day, every day, I diligently added to my notes app. I began to notice that people were constantly going above and beyond to help me out. In making a list of all the great things happening to me, my brain began to hunt for more evidence of it.When my alarm went off, I knew good things were going to happen that day because I had a bounty of proof of it. I went to social events alone, but now I assumed people were friendly and would be interested in chatting to me, and I to them; I had no reason to think otherwise because my list supported this irrefutable and concrete reality. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy, and more wonderful things came. Or were they already there all along?Gratitude can be truly healing – but you need more than a checklistRead moreOf course I’m still prone to fretting, but on trickier days I sit and reread my list – which stretches on in my phone – and it reminds me that good stuff is on the way. A friend observed it’s just another way of practising gratitude, which made me wince at first. I know the benefits of gratitude lists are extolled in pretty much every self-help book under the sun, but I always found the process of doing them a little fake and draining. If it had been a genuinely bad day, why was I being guilted into writing down that I was thankful for my warm bed, the gift of my breath, or the smell of the rain? What a slog.This list, instead, is real and evidence-based. It’s not part of a morning positivity ritual. It is as simple as: this happened and it was objectively good.Not too long ago, I used to be convinced that some people had lovely, pleasant thoughts because good things always happened to them. But now, I’m sure it’s the other way around.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe one change that workedMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

About half are unable to perform routine daily tasks.The trial,reported in Nature Medicine, focused on people with moderate to severe treatment-resistant depression. One half received a single 21.5mg dose of DMT infused into a vein over 10 minutes. The other half received a placebo infused the same way. All of the participants had psychotherapy and follow-up assessments.Patients given DMT improved significantly compared with the placebo group, as measured by scores on a standard depression questionnaire, with the antidepressant effects lasting from three to six months.DMT is an active ingredient of the ayahuasca brew used in shamanistic rituals in South America. The drug induces powerful and often mystical hallucinogenic trips that can alter people’s sense of time and space, dissolve their sense of self, and conjure up meetings withotherworldly beings.In the second stage of the trial, all participants received a dose of DMT with therapy, but the researchers found no additional benefit in those who had two doses in total, suggesting a single dose may suffice. The trial was designed, funded and sponsored by Cybin UK, a neuropsychiatric firm.The study follows apositive trialwith psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, which has raised hopes for the drug being approved for treatment of depression later this year.Psychedelics are thought to enhance the effects of psychotherapy by helping people break entrenched and unhelpful patterns of thinking. Erritzoe likens the effect to shaking up the snow on a mountain and flattening the hills and valleys so people can easily find new routes. “You redistribute the snow so it’s easier to take new tracks, and at the same time it becomes easier to take new routes because the landscape has been flattened,” he said.At doses used in the trials, DMT induces a shorter but more intense trip than psilocybin, with the experience lasting about 25 minutes compared with a couple of hours for psilocybin. That could make DMT-assisted therapy easier for clinics to deliver, although patients may need more support to recover from particularly intense DMT trips.If regulators were to approve psychedelics for treating depression in the UK, researchers expect them to become available only through private clinics, said Dr James Rucker, a consultant psychiatrist at King’s College London who worked on the psilocybin trial.Last year the Feilding commission was set up to guide the safe, ethical and equitable rollout of psychedelic-assisted therapies amid concerns that commercial pressures at private clinics could undermine safety, leading to patient harm.Rucker said: “Quite how these drugs will fit in this world of financial austerity, stigma and opprobrium towards anything that has the word psychoactive in it, I don’t know. It’s interesting to be a part of, but I can’t call it.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchDrugsDepressionMental healthHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Human skin has evolved to retain water, thanks to a protective barrier on its surface. But that barrier isn’t totally watertight. Water is constantly moving across it, depending on the humidity of the surrounding air.Skin tends to be most comfortable at a relative humidity of about 40%. When the air around us is drier than that, water is more likely to leave the skin. That matters because the process of water escaping across the skin barrier is mildly inflammatory.“The skin becomes drier,” says Craythorne. “Your blood vessels become a little bit more dilated, making skin look red. Cytokines are stirred up, which are little proteins that set off more inflammatory reactions but also irritate our nerve endings. Things might feel more itchy.”Is it true that … red light therapy masks prevent wrinkles?Read moreCraythorne says central heating can cause these reactions because it creates a warm but very dry environment, especially if it’s been on hot all day with no ventilation. But she says it’s not the only culprit for irritation in the winter. Cold outdoor air can be even more drying as it naturally holds less moisture – and wind makes things worse by speeding up the evaporation of both water and the skin’s natural oils.“Some people are more susceptible than others,” she says, “particularly those who have eczema or rosacea.”She says that if you are struggling with irritated skin in the winter, it can help to keep central heating a little cooler and to use a humidifier. Be gentle with your skin: avoid harsh soaps and opt for creamy, soap-free cleansers. Use a fragrance-free moisturising cream that contains occlusives to slow water loss, alongside ingredients such as ceramides and glycerin to support the skin barrier and draw in moisture. “Think of it as putting a little blanket on your skin for the winter,” she says.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleIs it true that …Health & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Together they represent a world of exotic aromas, from amber and musk to ginger and saffron. But given that I have left the grey British winter behind to come here, I am more interested in capturing the sunny essence of the Côte d’Azur.Here in the hills north of Cannes, the colours pop: hillsides are full of bright yellow mimosa flowers, violets are peeping out of flowerbeds and oranges hang heavy on branches over garden walls, even though it’s not yet spring. It is the perfect antidote to the gloom back home, and the chance to bottle these very scents is a joy.View image in fullscreenOver the next two hours, with the help of perfumery expert Manon Zamoun, I blend my own perfume that I name “Mimosa trail”. The scents (natural essences or synthetic aromas), are set out on three shelves, the top shelf for the high notes, the bottom for base notes, with the heart notes in between. I sniff, blend and decant; it’s the most rewarding chemistry lesson of my life.The bottles’ labels are turned away from me so my choices are led by my nose not my brain. I’m surprised to find I liked parma violets and patchouli, while rose d’orient and fleurs de lilas don’t make the cut.Galimard is Grasse’s oldest perfume house, established in 1747. The trade grew out of the town’s leather tanning industry; with scents created to cover the pong, it became the “perfume capital of the world”. Its other two famous perfume houses, Molinard and Fragonard, opened in 1849 and 1926 respectively, later joined by big names such as Dior, Guérlain and Chanel.But beyond perfume, Grasse is a delight to wander – a maze of yellow-hued streets, overlooked by towering palm trees and, today at least, a welcome blue sky, though there’s still a little chill in the air. I take comfort in the fact it’s 10 degrees warmer than it is back home because I’m here to fast-forward spring with a short road trip between the lesser-known villages and towns of the Côte d’Azur.View image in fullscreenGrasse, where the perfume industry developed initially to cover the smell of the town’s leather tanning trade.Photograph: StockByM/Getty ImagesEn route to Grasse, I’d stopped at Tourrettes-sur-Loup for another of the region’s flowers: violets. When seen from the south, the village is a jumble of terracotta-roofed houses clinging to a clifftop. It’s known for its tradition of growing the small, purple blooms, and has supplied the perfume industry since Queen Victoria visited in the late 19th century while wintering in Nice, 18 miles (30km) south west of here. The queen gave her name to the variety that was, in her day, cultivated by 40 families in Tourrettes and, thanks to its long stalk, was traditionally given in small posies between Christmas and Valentine’s Day.Producers have turned the delicate flavour of mimosa into jams and cordials, and its scent into candles and soapsAtLa Bastide aux Violettes, a small museum on the outskirts of the village, I discover more about the flower and its history, and inhale its sweet, delicate scent in the greenhouse, where they grow in vertical columns. There are now only three producers, includingJérôme Coche and his family, who turn the petals into products such as crystalised violet sweets. The village still celebrates the end of the season withLa Fête des Violettesin late February/early March, which attracts about 12,000 people (some on coach trips from Italy) with carnival floats, dancing, music and a flower and produce market.Out of season the village is quieter, awaiting the summer crowds. Wine bar-restaurantLa Cave de Tourrettesis buzzing with life though, even on a wet Wednesday evening, and my two-course meal is a superb beef tartare with grana padano, caper berries and cornichons, followed by pork filet mignon and orange-scented sweet potato with braised leeks (mains from €25.50). The next morning, the sky is a blaze of blue and I eat breakfast on the balcony ofmy townhouse apartment, with a lovely view of the valley towards the Mediterranean.View image in fullscreenA cafe in Mandelieu-la-Napoule decorated with mimosas.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyThe sun is also shining in Mandelieu-la-Napoule, on the coast, my last stop. Mimosas were just starting to come into bloom on the dramatic route between Tourrettes and the village of Gourdon, which winds through the Gorge du Loup, with its waterfalls, tunnels and steep cliffs – but down on the coast, spring has really sprung.La Route du Mimosais a trail through the most impressive blooms, covering 80 miles from Bormes-les-Mimosas to Grasse. Around the town of Mandelieu-la-Napoule – which hosts theFête du Mimosa, a weekend of celebrations to mark the start of the season in February – there are group hikes into the hills organised by the tourist office, as well as farms to visit and shops where producers have turned its delicate flavour into jams and cordials, and its scent into candles and soaps.For a thrilling ride and to gain some local knowledge I’ve booked a three-hour tour withLa Grande Vadrouille(€160 for one or two). Local guide Daniel Saffioti welcomes me to ride in the side-car of his Chang Jiang Pekin Express motorbike. Daniel knows all the best routes from Mandelieu to Tanneron, a town farther inland where you find mimosas in abundance. After donning my helmet and sunglasses, we set off along the coast road, La Corniche d’Or.Along La Route du Mimosa, mimosas burst between palm trees and over the garden walls of luxurious villasThis sinuous route southward to the Cap d’Esterel offers astonishing views of Cannes and its backdrop, the snow-capped Mercantour mountains of the Alpes-Maritimes. Along the road, mimosas burst between palm trees and over the garden walls of luxurious villasWe double back toward Mandelieu, and then motor on into the hills, stopping for a rest just outside Tanneron, where the landscape is a tapestry of olive groves, eucalyptus trees and lavender fields awaiting their summer blooms. A closer inspection of a mimosa tree allows me to breath in its delicate scent and see its fern-like leaves and tiny flowers up close – like little yellow pompoms electrified by the sunshine. Daniel tells me how they were introduced by the British, having been brought from Australia (they are a kind of acacia) and how council workers work hard to keep them from taking over the landscape and roadsides, such is their propensity to thrive in the Provençal climate.Our tour finishes in Mandelieu and after bidding Daniel farewell, I sit on the terrace of theBiskotacafe for lunch and a mimosa-infused lemonade. In the evening is the opening of theFête du Mimosa. Gingham-clothed tables and benches are laid out for locals to sit and drink wine and street performers, some on stilts, dance through the crowds. Tomorrow there will be floats adorned with flowers, but tonight a firework display shoots up over the crenellated walls of the waterside chateau. I breath in the sulphurous tang that hangs in the air; it may not be the floral scent of spring, but it doesn’t matter – I’ve got a bottle of that in my bag.The trip was provided byCôte d’Azur Tourism and Mandelieu-La-Napoule Tourism.La Borgardain Tourrettes-sur-Loup has a one-bedroom apartment from€195 a night and a three-bedroom townhouse from €330 a night.

A smart new hat puzzleThe answer to today’s peaky poserAlex BellosMon 16 Feb 2026 11.55 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 11.57 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleEarlier today I set you this logic puzzle. Here is is again with the solution.(If you found it too simple.Here’s a harder version.)Head sumsAde, Binky, and Carl are honest perfect logicians. A hat is placed on each of their heads. Each hat has a whole number larger than zero written on it, which the other two logicians can see but which the wearer cannot. One of these numbers is the sum of the other two (so for example, the three numbers could be 3, 7, 4, or another possibility is 6, 6, 12). All of this is public knowledge.Ade sees that Binky has a 3 and Carl has a 1.Ade says for all to hear: “ I do not know the number on my hat”Binky then announces: “I do not know the number on my hat”Ade then announces: “I know the number on my hat!”What number is on Ade’s hat?Solution4When a logician looks at two hats, they need to work out if their hat is thesumof the two visible hats, or thedifferencebetween the two vsible hats.The first insight is that if a logician can see two identical numbers, they know that their hat is the sum. Their hat cannot be the difference, since the difference between two identical numbers is 0, which is not possible by the statement of the question.A sees that B has 3 and C has 1.A deduces that he must have either 4 (the sum), or 2 (the difference).A doesn’t yet know which, which is why A says “I don’t know the number on my hat.”However, A’s statement gives new public knowledge, namely that B ≠ C. (If B = C, then A would know the number on his hat is the sum, and A would not have said “I don’t know the number on my hat.”)B says “ I don’t know the number on my hat”. This statement tells everyone that A ≠ C.However, this statement also allows A to deduce that A ≠ 2.Let’s assume that A = 2. B therefore sees C = 1 and A= 2, so B knows that either B = 3 (the sum) or B = 1 (the difference). But B has learned that B ≠ C. And since C = 1, B cannot be 1. So if A = 2, B would have deduced that she was 3 and she would not have said “I don’t know the number on my hat.”So A = 4. It’s the number on Ade’s hat.The puzzle was devised byTimothy Chow, inspired by a puzzle byDick Hess. Chow had originally formulated a harder question, which can be read here onPuzzling Stack Exchange.I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one,email me.Explore more on these topicsMathematicsAlex Bellos's Monday puzzleShareReuse this content"

After moving to the UK and marrying a British woman, he became a restaurateur and an avid keeper of birds.All the while, however – as the Guardian’s community affairs correspondent,Chris Osuh, explains – he was hiding a secret: he had pledged allegiance toIslamic State.On Friday, Saadaoui, 38, and Amar Hussein, 52, were sentenced to life imprisonment after attempting to carry out what could have been one of the deadliest terror attacks in the UK. They had planned a devastating assault on Greater Manchester’s Jewish community. Unbeknown to them, the fellow IS supporter involved in their plot – known by the codename ‘Farouk’ – was in fact an undercover police officer.Saadaoui’s younger brother, Bilel Saadaoui, was jailed for six years for failing to disclose information about the plan.Osuh, who has been covering the trial, speaks toHelen Piddabout how the plot was uncovered and the impact it has had on one of the largest Jewish communities in the world.Photograph: Greater Manchester Police/PAExplore more on these topicsAntisemitismToday in FocusUK security and counter-terrorismManchesterIslamic StateGreater ManchesterJudaismReligion"

A 31-year-old construction worker, Montenegro had been out all night drinking with some work buddies in the city of Cuautla and was waiting for a bus back to nearby Cuernavaca, where he lived.At about 10am, a white van pulled up: several men jumped out and dragged Montenegro and a co-worker inside before speeding off. Montenegro’s co-worker was released a few hundred meters down the street, but Montenegro was driven away.As soon as she heard that her son had been taken, Montenegro’s mother, Patricia García, raced to Cuautla along with Montenegro’s wife, brother and some neighbors. Arriving at the bus stop, all they found were Montenegro’s cap and one of his tennis shoes.The group spent all day looking for any other trace of Montenegro, but came up empty-handed. “The desperation started when night fell,” said García, who has now spent more than three torturous years looking for her son.Montenegro is one of more than 130,000 people who are considered missing or disappeared in Mexico, an ongoing crisis that has devastated tens of thousands of families across the country. While disappearances began to surge in the early 2000s as the Mexican government sought to take on the country’s cartels,a new reportby the public policy analysis firm México Evalúa found that, in the last 10 years, disappearances have increased more than 200%.“It’s a problem that has become uncontrollable at the national level,” said Armando Vargas, a security analyst at México Evalúa. Disappearances “capture the lethal violence” thatMexicois experiencing.According to Vargas, the surge in disappearances over the last decade reflects the increasing takeover by criminal groups of vast swathes of the country, as well as the diversification of the activities these gangs are engaged in beyond just drug smuggling.Secret ovens and human remains: grisly Mexico killing site spotlights forced disappearancesRead moreExpanding their ranks often involves forced recruitment, while taking over new territory requires the “annihilation of rival groups”, said Vargas. But simply murdering other gang members is likely to catch the authorities’ attention: instead, cartels bury corpses in unmarked graves, burn them to ash or even dissolve them in vats of acid.By making bodies disappear, criminal groups “invisibilize the violence, because that puts them under the radar”, Vargas said.Meanwhile, criminal groups are increasingly engaging in activities that can involve abducting people and making them vanish, including organ trafficking, sex and human trafficking, and migrant smuggling.The Mexican government, however, has been unable to keep up with cartels as they expand territorially and into new markets, leaving large areas of the country under near-total control of these gangs.“Criminal power advances in parallel with institutional neglect,” said Vargas.In 2018, the government launched a the National Search Commission to track and find the disappeared, encouraging more people to report their missing loved ones and creating an interactivepublic platformthat recorded disappearances across the country.But the commission was poorly funded, and the platform soon became a political thorn in the government’s side: ahead of elections in 2024, the then president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador,launched an opaque “review”of the register, and reduced the number of disappeared to just 12,377, sparking an outcry among activists and human rights experts.‘Disappearing the disappeared’: outcry after Mexico reduces number of missingRead moreWhen asked about the report from México Evalúa, the president,Claudia Sheinbaum, was dismissive, saying “that platform has a lot of problems” and promising that the government would be releasing a new report to more accurately account for the disappeared.But analysts say that, if anything, the number of registered disappearances is an undercount, given the extreme rates of violence across the country and the government’s weakness in finding and identifying bodies.When investigations do take place, they are often slow and ineffective, marred by corruption and incompetence: in 2022, more than 96% of crimes in Mexico went unsolved,according to the United Nations.The lack of a substantial government response to the crisis has forcedmany mothers, including García, to search on their own. García joined a collective of 12 women who went out searching weekly, probing the ground with metal rods for signs of buried corpses.The November after Montenegro was taken, García and the group searched in a field on the outskirts of Cuautla where his phone had last pinged a cell tower. They found six bodies buried there, but none were her son. Four months later they went back and found another five bodies. Again, none were her son.Despite the gruesome work, García is still searching, refusing to give up hope. But the search has taken a terrible toll, with García forced to divide her time between caring for her family and looking for her son.“You’re left in broken pieces,” said García. “It’s like when a vase shatters: you can glue it back together but the cracks are always there.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoClaudia SheinbaumAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Hundreds of millions of people will be crisscrossing the country to make what is often their only trip home to see their families for the Chinese new year celebrations.Harry Potter’s Draco Malfoy becomes mascot for year of the horse in ChinaRead moreAlthough China is no longer the world’s most populous country, losing that title to India in2023, China’s annualchunyun,or “spring transportation” is still the world’s largest mass migration of people.The official lunar new year holiday will be nine days this year, rather than the typical eight, giving people a longer break to spend their holidayhongbao,red packets of cash given to relatives during the festive period. The holiday period runs from 15-23 February, with New Year’s Day falling on 17 February.China will be ushering in the year of the horse, said to represent optimism and opportunity, following theyear of the snake, a period that represents transformation akin to the reptile’s habit of shedding skins.An article recently published by Jiangsu province’s propaganda department made the government’s hopes for the festive period clear: “Driven by holiday consumption, the spring festival cultural and tourism consumption month is leading the way in activating domestic demand”. The holiday would help to “unleash the surging vitality that propels China’s economy forward”, the department wrote, using an idiom that literally means “ten thousand horses galloping forwards”.View image in fullscreenChina’s economy still suffers from the fact that households save an unusually large share of their income.Photograph: Jessica Lee/EPATo help translate this astrological power into reality, the central government said it would issue more than 360m yuan ($52m) in consumer vouchers in February.“There is no question that [lunar new year] provides a huge lift for retailers and providers of consumer services who might otherwise have had a pretty boring February,” said George Magnus, research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre.But on a macro level, China’s economy still suffers from Chinese households saving an unusually large share of their income – around a third – while GDP growth is propped up by exports to other countries.Last year, national retail sales, a metric for consumer spending, grew 3.7%, below the 5%overall GDP growth rate.Boosting demandat home will be a priority of China’s next five-year plan, the economic planning document that will be approved by the country’s parliament in March. The Communist party has already said that it will be focused on “vigorously boosting consumption”.In January, the national development and reform commission said it would be formulating an action plan to expand domestic demand over the next five years.One area of opportunity is the service sector, such as elderly care, entertainment and healthcare, which grew by 5.5% last year. Those sectors are relatively undeveloped compared with consumer goods, meaning there is more room for growth.View image in fullscreenThe cinema is a particularly popular new year’s activity.Photograph: Jessica Lee/EPAThe cinema is a particularly popular new year’s activity. Last year,Ne Zha 2, an animation about a demon child, was a runaway hit, earning 4.8bn yuan in its first week at the Chinese box office after a lunar new year release. It went on to earn more than 14bn yuan, becoming the best-performing film in Chinese cinema history.It remains to be seen whether this year’s releases – the comedy-action film Pegasus 3 and Scare Out, a national security themed blockbuster – will replicate Ne Zha 2’s success.One service that had a brief moment of popularity was offered by a delivery platform, UU Paotui. The courier services company recently launched a product called “proxy Chinese new year visits”. For 999 yuan ($145), a user could book someone to visit elderly relatives and perform the traditional kowtowing rituals that children do for their parents, while livestreaming the encounter to the customer. But after an outcry about the degradation of traditional rituals, the company withdrew the service.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaLunar new yearAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2021, she was stripped of her citizenship in a move which provoked an outcry from human rights groups.For years, the Australian government has resisted pressure to repatriate the women and children, while humanitarian and legal advocates have urged their evacuation out of Syria, warning that the conditions in detention facilities were“life-threatening”.None of the Australians held in Roj camp has been charged with a crime or face warrants for arrest, although they could face charges on return to Australia.A spokesperson for the Australian government said the government was not helping the women and children return to Australia.Can Syria keep the world safe from IS fighters?Read more“The Australian government is not and will not repatriate people from Syria.“Our security agencies have been monitoring – and continue to monitor – the situation in Syria to ensure they are prepared for any Australians seeking to return to Australia.”The spokesperson said that those returning could face charges.“People in this cohort need to know that if they have committed a crime and if they return to Australia they will be met with the full force of the law.“The safety of Australians and the protection of Australia’s national interests remain the overriding priority.”Conditions in Roj camp have steadily deteriorated and the camp is a regular target for Islamic state incursions. The US has described the Syrian detentions camps as “incubators for radicalisation”.Shamima Begum, the formerly British womanwho was stripped of her citizenshipfor travelling to Syria as a teenager where she married an IS fighter, is also thought to be held at Roj.Dysentery and influenza outbreaks are common, spreading quickly across populations living in close quarters in dilapidated tents, particularly among underdeveloped and undernourished children, and fires regularly break out in camp tents. Heating fuel is reportedly running low.One Australian child developed frostbitein a previous winter.Human Rights Watch has described“inhuman, degrading, and life-threatening conditions”in the camps, saying the indefinite detention of the women and children, without charge or trial, was unlawful.The US funds the bulk of security operations across north-east Syria through the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. It wants the camp closed and has withdrawn funding and pushed allies to repatriate their citizens.View image in fullscreenAustralian nationals leave Roj camp before ‘poor coordination’ meant they were sent back.Photograph: Baderkhan Ahmad/APIslamic State “continues to seek to indoctrinate residents and toinfiltrate the detention facilities” at Roj.The commander of US Central Command, Adm Brad Cooper,told a UN conferencein September “as time goes on, these camps are incubators for radicalisation”.“This problem will only get worse with time … inaction is not an option. Every day without repatriation compounds the risk to all of us.”Cooper urged “every nation with detained or displaced personnel in Syria to return your citizens”.The Australian government undertook two successful repatriation missions – of eight orphaned children in 2019, and of four women and 13 children in 2022 – but said consistently it had no plan to repatriate the final group.In October, two women and four childrenescaped al-Hawl detention campnearer to Iraq, making their way across Syria to Lebanon, where they were given passports at the Australian embassy. They returned to Australia on a commercial flight.In 2024, Clare O’Neil as home affairs minister was preparing to bring a plan to repatriate the remaining Australians to cabinet for approval. But there were concerns within government overbacklash to any repatriationfrom community groups in electorally critical marginal seats in western Sydney, despite the fact many of those still held in Roj camp were from Victoria.The chief executive of Save the Children Australia, Mat Tinkler, said his organisation did not fund or undertake repatriations, and was not involved in the extraction of the Australians from the camps.“These reports underscore what national security experts have repeatedly said: that the unmanaged return of Australian citizens would inevitably happen in the absence of federal government action to repatriate them,” he said.“Australians should never be left without a safe or viable pathway home. These innocent children have already lost years of their childhood, and deserve the chance to rebuild their lives in safety at home, and to reintegrate into the Australian way of life.”The Guardian has put questions to the federal government about the women and children’s return.The release of the Australian families comes as detention camps in north-east Syria holding IS-affiliated families have rapidly emptied out over the past two weeks. Al-Hawl camp, which had a population of 25,000 IS-affiliated residents from 42 different countries just last month, became almost uninhabited this week.The remainder of the camp’s residents were transferred to a new camp in Aleppo by the Damascus government. The new camp would have new prefabricated houses, wifi and would not have a locked gate – a stark contrast to the squalid, securitised camps which imprisoned families for years in northeast Syria.Residents have already began to make their way back to their home countries, with a Belgian woman returning to Belgium last weekend seemingly independently. She was immediately arrested.Since the territorial defeat of IS in 2019, tens of thousands of suspected IS fighters and their families have been held in camps and prisons across northeast Syria, guarded by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The SDF and their international partners urged the international community to take back its citizens, warning that any escape by detainees could lead to a resurgence in IS in Syria and across the region.For years, the international community ignored these pleas. Since Damascus took over many of these camps as part of its battle against the SDF, however, repatriations and release of these residents have suddenly accelerated, in murky circumstances.Damascus, in contrast to the SDF, has a seemingly different approach to the camps, viewing the previous policy of indefinite detention as unsustainable and inhumane. The US-led international coalition to defeat IS has transferred about 5,700 male IS detainees to prisons in Iraq over the last month, finishing the transfers on Friday.Rights groups have raised concerns over the transfers, pointing to abuses in Iraqi prisons and the fact that the detained men have not yet faced a judge. Likely among those transferred to Iraq is Mustafa Hajj-Obeid, an Australian man who was found by the Guardian to be in custody of the SDF in north-east Syria in 2025.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsSyriaIslamic StatenewsShareReuse this content"

He squeezed everything out of every moment.“When we skied together, he was at his happiest. He always said there was no better feeling in life, skiing fresh powder was pure freedom.”Benoît Bachelet, the Albertville prosecutor, said a manslaughter investigation had been launched. The ski instructor, who was uninjured, tested negative for drugs.This incident follows the death ofanother British skierin his 50s in an avalanche at the nearby La Plagne resort in January.Thirteen backcountry skiers, climbers and hikers died in the Italian mountains in the first week of February amid unstable snow conditions.Atrain was derailedby a snow slide in Switzerland on Monday as large areas of the western Alps remained under a high risk of avalanche.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeEurope weatherSkiingnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not rocket science,” said van Aalst, who used to lead the climate centre at the International Red Cross and Red Crescent and is now the director general of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI).The ESABCC describes current efforts to adapt to rising temperatures as “insufficient, largely incremental [and] often coming too late” in a new report that advises officials to prepare for a world 2.8-3.3C hotter than preindustrial levels by 2100.Such a dramatic rise in temperatures – the prospect of which has left some leading climate scientists feelinghopeless– would be double the level of global heating that world leaders promised to aim for when they signed the Paris agreement in 2015. The ESABCC recommended officials stress-test even hotter scenarios.View image in fullscreenThe Portuguese army comes to the aid of residents affected by flooding.Photograph: Adri Salido/Anadolu/Getty ImagesWeather extremes in Europe in recent years have at times surprised climate scientists with theirstrengthand adaptation experts with theirlethalityas rising temperatures have warped the climate.Heavy rains supercharged by climate breakdown killed 134 people in Germany’s Ahr valley in 2021 and 229 people in the Valencia region of Spain in 2024. Across the continent, summer heat kills many tens of thousands of people each year, with studies attributing betweenhalfandtwo-thirdsof the death toll to the rise in temperatures caused by fossil fuel pollution. Last year’s wildfires, meanwhile,torchedmore of Europe than scientists have ever recorded.Last week,Portugal was urgedto draw up climate adaptation plans as the country was hit by an unprecedented series of storms that killed at least 16 people and caused an estimated €775m (£675m) of damage.EU urged not to roll back green agenda in effort to revive faltering economyRead moreVan Aalst said: “Twenty years ago, we’d have said those extremes are indeed going to be a problem, but primarily in poorer countries that cannot cope. What we’re now noticing is that Europe itself is vulnerable, especially for conditions it has not faced in the past.“It turns out our preparedness is not so great. And we have real work to do to upgrade our early warning systems.”The ESABCC report recommends that the EU mandate climate risk assessments, embed climate resilience into all policies and channel more money – including from private sources – into protective measures. It does not estimate the scale of investments needed to keep Europe safe.Van Aalst, who was an author of the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, said the most important message was to avoid a future in which the world heats to such an extreme degree.“The IPCC is clear this is a very problematic future with rapidly rising risks,” he said. “And for a number of risks, we’ll reach the limits of adaptation.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She had been in Athens since 4 February working on the latest season of the spy thriller.The country’s public broadcaster, KAN, said: “We are saddened by the passing of our friend and partner in a long line of productions, series, and programmes.“Dana was among the senior figures in the Israeli television industry and played a central role in creating and leading some of the corporation’s most prominent and influential productions.”Tehran, starring Niv Sultan as the Mossad agent Tamar Rabinyan, tells the story of an Iranian-born spy brought up in Israel and recruited to infiltrate Iran to dismantle the country’s burgeoning nuclear programme.The series, which featured Glenn Close in a starring role in the second season, has been described by the New York Times as so persuasively plausible in its portrayal of Israel’s famed intelligence agency that “even the FBI director endorsed it”. The Iranian regime has repeatedly criticised the show as Zionist propaganda.From its inception, Tehran had been filmed in Athens, the location production teams believed came closest to resembling the Iranian capital with its web of “narrow residential streets and alleys and wide boulevards and squares”.Both cities are surrounded by mountains and have a shared chaos suffused with a similar Mediterranean light.The thriller series has attracted such audiences that Apple TV decided to finance a fourth season in December.KAN said Eden’s contribution to the industry would not be forgotten easily.“Her professional and personal legacy will continue to shape Israeli television for many years to come,” it said.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The Lyon prosecutor, Thierry Dran, said Deranque was assaulted by at least six masked individuals. Police were working to identify suspects and no arrests had been made, Dran said.Deranque was attacked on Thursday on the sidelines of a protest against a university conference attended by Rima Hassan, a European member of parliament for Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s leftwing party, La France Insoumise (LFI).The anti-immigration Nemesis collective, which is close to the far right, was protesting against the conference. Nemesis said at the weekend that Deranque had been present to protect its members as securityand was assaulted by anti-fascist activists.Deranque’s family lawyer said in a statementto French media that the student appeared to have been ambushed by “organised and trained individuals, vastly superior in number and armed, some with their faces masked”. The lawyer told Le Monde that Deranque was not part of security for any organisation, had no criminal record and defended his political convictions “in a non-violent way”.View image in fullscreenDeranque was attacked on Thursday near a protest against a conference at the Sciences Po Lyon university.Photograph: Olivier Chassignole/AFP/Getty ImagesThe death has inflamed political divisions in France ahead of municipal elections and next year’s presidential race. The LFI party, described by Mélenchon as “radical left”, was officially labelled as “far left”by the French interior ministry this month before the local elections in March. The LFI, as well as the Socialist party leader, Olivier Faure, protested against this label.On Monday, the government spokesperson Maud Bregeon accused the LFI of having “encouraged a climate of violence for years”.She told the broadcaster BFMTV that there was “therefore – in light of the political climate and the climate of violence – a moral responsibility on the part of LFI” for the attack on Thursday.A video broadcast by TF1 of the alleged attack on Thursday showed a group of people hitting three others lying on the ground, two of whom managed to escape while one lay motionless. A witness told Agence France-Presse: “People were hitting each other with iron bars.”Demonstrations called by the far right in memory of Deranque have taken place in the southern city of Montpellier and in Paris, where protesters unfurled a banner reading “antifa murderers, justice for Quentin”.The LFI lawmaker Éric Coquerel, speaking to the public broadcaster Franceinfo, condemned “all political violence” and said the activists responsible for Hassan’s security “were in no way involved in what happened”.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, wrote on social media over the weekend: “It is essential that the perpetrators of this ignominy be prosecuted, brought to justice and convicted. Hatred that kills has no place among us. I call for calm, restraint and respect.”Explore more on these topicsFranceThe far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Iranian foreign ministry regards it as a branch of chess, almost an art form.Indeed, for those in the US who claim Iran loves to play for time and spin a negotiation out, Araghchi’s book, The Power of Negotiation, provides some support.“The main principle of bargaining is practice: repetition, repetition, and repetition – combined with steadfastness and persistence. Insisting on positions and repeating demands is a necessity that must be done each time with different rhetoric and reasoning,” he writes.Born into a family of merchants – his grandfather was a carpet trader – he argues Iranian diplomacy reflects the country’s bazaars.“The Iranian negotiation style is generally known in the world as the ‘market style’, which means continuous and tireless bargaining. It requires a lot of time and energy, and he who gets tired and bored quickly will lose.”More theoretically, he argues in the book – written when out of office in 2014 – that when a negotiator enters the room, their true power rests on the level of national cohesion back home and the country’s military strength.If there is not at least a balance of power with your adversary, he argues it is best to decline talks until there is equilibrium, something Iran did after thebombing of its nuclear sites in June last year.Nevertheless, the Iranian tendency to say “Yes, but” can go far. Famously, Araghchi reduced his US counterpart Wendy Sherman to tears of frustration – something he regrets.Araghchi, who has already had six rounds of direct and indirect talks in two phases with Witkoff also discloses how vital it is to remain opaque.“The face of a skilled diplomat is inscrutable, and it is impossible to catch any emotion from it. The ability to control the expression of emotions on the face is not easy and requires continuous work and practice.”Providing your adversary with a graceful way out, he argues, is integral to diplomacy, describing this as providing “the Golden Bridge”, a term he has picked up from China (Araghchi spent four years as ambassador to Japan).This suggests that if Trump ends up accepting a version of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal from which he walked out in 2018, Araghchi will not be triumphalist. “Diplomacy is not a game that you must necessarily win, but a process where you must necessarily understand the other side,” he writes.Married twice, and with five children, Araghchi is a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war and maintains close relations with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC, unlike his predecessor, Zarif, whocriticised the elite forces’ power.“Araghchi is much more technocratic and careful in walking the tightrope necessary to survive,” said Ellie Geranmayeh from the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Zarif was more political and outspoken, and willing to test the boundaries of what was digestible for the regime.”Indeed, some thought Araghchi was put in the nuclear talks with Washington by Iranian conservatives to act as a check and balance on Zarif.Geranmayeh expects the US to make clear demands on diluting, or removing Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium, but such an irreversible step by Iran would require parallel irreversible steps by the US, such as releasing many of Iran’s large assets frozen abroad.The scope for a compromise on enrichment exists on the basis that the bombing of its nuclear sites makes it impossible to enrich for 3 to 5 years. But this would require the return of the UN nuclear inspectorate, the IAEA, to be able to visit the bombed sites, an issue that was probably at the centre of talks on Monday between Araghchi and Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general.Outside the nuclear aspects of the deal, Geranmayeh says: “In this Trumpian world, do not expect every agreement to be written down on paper. There could be a series of not verifiable understandings, including a non-aggression pact between Iran and the US and its allies.”Ali Ansari, professor of modern history at the University of St Andrews, said Iran may offer concessions “to keep the discussions going, but Trump is in no rush at present anyway”.Bringing in US oil companies – an economic concession that has been floated – would be a significant change in Iran’s anti-US revolutionary doctrine.Either way, Araghchi knows that whatever the outcome, he faces domestic criticism.Araghchi recalled once meeting with Zarif in the lift of Hassan Rouhani’s residence after the latter’s 2013 presidential election victory. At the time, Zarif had not yet accepted Rouhani’s offer to serve as his foreign minister. Araghchi asked him why. Zarif replied: ‘In the end, we’ll be found wanting, and we will be the victims.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaIran nuclear programmeUS foreign policyTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

Calling them a “ticking time bomb”, relief groups said the women and children could not just be left to rot in squalid desert camps indefinitely, because eventually they would come home.Despite the warnings, most states ignored the problem, refusing to repatriate their citizens. At least 8,000 women and children from more than 40 countries have been stranded in the camps of north-eastSyriasince 2019.This week,they started to come home. Belgian authorities reported a woman charged in absentia for IS membership had made her way from Turkey to Belgium. An Albanian woman, kidnapped as a child by her father and taken to Syria, managed to smuggle herself to Turkey, where she requested travel documents.Australian women and children sent back to Syrian detention camp after initial releaseRead moreThousands more non-Syrian women and children are distributed across the country, their whereabouts mostly unknown. Most of them were residents of al-Hawl camp, once the world’s largest prison camp, which housed about 25,000 family members of suspected IS fighters, 6,000 of whom were foreigners.Security analysts have said the camp became a hotbed for extremist ideology, and that by keeping IS-affiliated women and children in such close quarters, a new generation of IS members was being raised. Humanitarians raised the alarm about what they called life-threatening living conditions, under which residents died of asphyxiation each winter as they tried to escape the cold by burning coal in their tents.SinceDamascus took over al-Hawlas part of its wresting of territory from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) last month, the camp has slowly emptied. Smugglers, foreign fighters and family members have come to the camp each night to retrieve residents, most of whom were taken to Idlib, a province in north-west Syria where many former Islamist fighters live.Frustrated by their governments’ lack of action, family members have begun to organise the return of people formerly held in detention facilities. The Belgian and Albanian women smuggled themselves out of Syria into Turkey without the coordination of their governments.2:33The 'ticking-bomb' Syrian prisons filled with IS suspects – video explainerOn Monday, relatives of 34 Australian women and childrenorganised a convoy of minibusesfrom al-Roj camp in north-east Syria, where the SDF is holding more than 2,000 families of suspected IS fighters. They set off for Damascus, seemingly without the backing of Canberra, with the aim of boarding flights back to Australia.They were turned back en route, apparently for not coordinating with Damascus in advance, but Syrian officials say their return has only been briefly delayed.Damascus, unlike the SDF, seem unwilling to play prison warden in perpetuity. A humanitarian who met interior ministry officials shortly before Damascus took over al-Hawl last month said they approached the camp as a child protection rather than a security issue.A new camp Damascus has set up to house al-Hawl residents who do not want to leave has wifi and an open door – a far cry from the Humvees with mounted machine guns the SDF maintained outside al-Hawl’s barbed-wire fences for years.‘Open the gates’: riots, fires and escape attempts as Syrian army takes over IS campRead moreGovernments seem to have lost their chance to manage the repatriation of their citizens – some of whom are said to be affiliated to IS – and instead now face a disorganised, chaotic process of returns which experts say place citizens and countries in danger.The prospect of thousands of women and children roaming Syria opens the door to renewed recruitment into extremist organisations such as IS, or trafficking and exploitation. A foreign woman from a country who escaped al-Hawl to Idlib last year was promptly kidnapped and had to be freed via ransom. Her family have not heard from her since.Many of the women have no desire to stay in Syria after years of horrific detention, asexplained by more than a dozen during a recent Guardian visit to al-Hawl, and will seek to return to their home countries.Dealing with their repatriation will be much more of a challenge for home governments now than it was before, when the families were concentrated in camps.Pressure is growing to release those women and children still held in al-Roj, where mostly European and Russian women are housed. That is where Shamima Begum, the UK-born woman who traveled to Syria at the age of 15 after chatting to a man there, lives.Governments such as the UK’s have refused for years to repatriate their citizens from al-Roj and other camps, preferring to kick the can down the road, and in Begum’s case strip her of her citizenship. Over the last month however, the room for further delay seems to be quickly narrowing.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIslamic StateMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It asked the museum to review its collections and revise terminology so relevant regions are referred to as Canaan, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, or Judea, depending on the period being described.While several displays have been updated, the museum has said these changes were made last year after feedback and audience research.View image in fullscreenThe Levant gallery at the British Museum.Photograph: IL Finkel/Photo courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum.It has said while the term “Palestine” was well established in western and Middle Eastern scholarship as a geographical and “neutral” designation for the southern area of the Levant since the late 19th century, it recognised that the term no longer holds a neutral designation and may be understood in reference to political territory.A spokesperson added: “For the Middle East galleries, for maps showing ancient cultural regions, the term ‘Canaan’ is relevant for the southern Levant in the later second millennium BC.“We use the UN terminology on maps that show modern boundaries, for example Gaza, West Bank, Israel, Jordan, and refer to ‘Palestinian’ as a cultural or ethnographic identifier where appropriate.”More than 5,000 people have since signed aChange.org petitioncalling for the museum to reverse its decision. The petition claims the move is “not supported by historical evidence and contributes to a wider pattern of erasing Palestinian presence from public memory”.According to UKLFI, the information panels in the Levant gallery, covering the period 2,000-300BC, have already been updated to describe the history of Canaan and the Canaanites and the rise of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. A panel in the Egypt galleries was amended to replace “Palestinian descent” with “Canaanite descent”.Further changes are expected as part of the museum’s long-term reconstruction and redisplay programme, and they will be implemented in the coming years.Explore more on these topicsBritish MuseumPalestineJudaismHistoryMiddle East and north AfricaLondonMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

The 23-year-old walks past the port and the breaking waves of the Mediterranean where he once earned his living.Before the two-year war that devastated Gaza, Bakr was a fisher, sharing tackle and a boat with his father and brothers. Now his brothers are dead, his father is too old, and his equipment was destroyed during the conflict. Like hundreds of thousands of others across Gaza, Bakr needs a job.“Money is the main means of survival in Gaza … without it, a person cannot do anything,” he says. “The limited aid that reaches us doesn’t replace our need for money in any way and doesn’t cover even the most basic living requirements.”Humanitarian organisations have ramped up distribution since October, when a ceasefire agreement came into effect, leading Israel to lift some of the heavy restrictions it had imposed on aid and easing its delivery within Gaza.‘I wish I had the power to ease his suffering’: Gaza’s cancer patients trapped by war and blockadeRead moreIn January, United Nations agencies and their partners reachedapproximately 1.6 million peoplewith household-level general food assistance. World Central Kitchen, an NGO, is now serving 1 million hot meals a day. But such assistance remains vastly insufficient and still covers only basic necessities. For everything else, brought in by the private sector, Palestinians in Gaza need cash.Aid workers in Gaza say more fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, clothes and household items are now available, but at exorbitant prices. “There has been a huge increase in commercial supplies … but it is all very expensive,” says Kate Charlton, a Médecins Sans Frontières medical coordinator in Gaza City.Mohammed al-Far, a 55-year-old former trader who lives with his family in al-Mawasi, a coastal area crowded with tent encampments for the displaced, says they receive only one meal a day from aid organisations.“It’s either rice, lentils or beans, and once or twice a week, some meat. Life requires cash to go on. We can get enough to eat … but transportation, haircuts, charging mobile phones and buying vegetables and fruit all require money,” he says.Al-Far has tried to launch falafel and sweets businesses, but without success, and has run up substantial debts. His age now makes it harder to find work.“My health is still good, and I’m ready to do anything, but employers are looking for younger workers. I have been searching for months and months … I walk around the market looking for work, but without success,” he says.View image in fullscreenPeople shop at a local market in Gaza City.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe problem for al-Far and Bakr, as for all the others seeking work in Gaza, is that there is virtually none. The official unemployment rate, estimated by the UN, is 80% and the economy has shrunk to 13% of its former size.In November, Pedro Manuel Moreno, the deputy secretary general of the UN’s trade and development agency, said the war had “wiped out decades of progress”. “Gaza is going through the fastest and most damaging economic collapse ever recorded,”he said.The UN agency’s data shows that in 2024, GDP per capita in Gaza fell to just $161 (£118) a year – among the lowest in the world. The Israeli offensive shattered sanitation, transport, power and health systems, ruined fields and greenhouses and decimated Gaza’s fishing industry, which once employed thousands.Bakr says: “I dream of returning to the sea and to the profession of fishing, and of being able one day to buy a fishing boat like the one I used to own, so I can provide my family with food, drink, clothing and medicine.”The October ceasefire agreement was supposed to lead swiftly to reconstruction but progress has largely stalled. Some elements of the agreement have advanced, including the return of all hostages and limited reopening of the Rafah border crossing. Plans for an international stabilisation force are also emerging, with Indonesia saying it is preparing thousands of troops for humanitarian and reconstruction roles.But Hamas, which controls most of the coastal area where almost all of the 2.3 million-strong population of Gaza now live, isreluctant to fully disarmand Israel appears unwilling to relinquish its control over more than half of the territory.Israel hasblocked the new technocratic administrationthat was to govern Gaza under Donald Trump’s “peace plan” from entering, while key crossing points remain shut or subject to restrictions.Even if Bakr could somehow find and equip a new boat, limits imposed by Israel at sea would prevent him from practising his trade.“My work as a fisher in the sea of Gaza was passed down to us from our grandfathers. I left school young and fishing is all I’ve ever done. I have been searching for work … everywhere I can,” he says.Israel accepts health authorities’ Gaza death toll is broadly accurate, saying 70,000 have diedRead moreEven those with advanced qualifications struggle amid the ruins and rubble. Bisan Mohammad graduated with a degree in medical laboratory sciences just months before the war in Gaza was triggered by a Hamas raid into Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to 250 being taken hostage by the militant Islamist organisation.Her husband, a security guard, was killed in the early days of the war, leaving her alone to provide for their daughter. She now lives in a tent with her parents in Nuseirat, in central Gaza.“I began looking for any available job but without success … everything needs money; even water, food and bedding all require cash. Sometimes I feel that even breathing needs money,” says Mohammad, 23.Violence has continued since the ceasefire and Israel launched more attacks in Gaza in January than in any month since October, according to Acled, an independent US-based conflict monitor. Gaza health authorities say 586 Palestinians have been killed since the truce took effect, bringing the war’s overall death toll to more than 72,000, mostly civilians.“What is being called a ‘ceasefire’ hasn’t changed our reality; in fact, it has made it worse,” says Mohammad. “The media has stopped talking about the ongoing killing … while the bombardment continues … prices keep rising, and even basic necessities, when available, such as water and food, are barely sufficient.“I don’t think about the future and I don’t try to; thinking about it is exhausting and frightening, and the future is unclear. I don’t know what will happen to me or my daughter if this situation continues without work or income.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Just marry me.”In an email exchange from 21 September 2011, she apparently wrote: “Don’t know if you are still on this bbm but heard from The Duke that you have had a baby boy.“Even though you never kept in touch, I still am here with love, friendship and congratualtions (sic) on your baby boy. Sarah xx”The email is then followed up with a message saying: “You have disappeared … I did not even know you were having a baby. It was soooo crystal clear to me that you were only friends with me to get to Andrew. And that really hurt me deeeply (sic). More than you will know.”Many of the exchanges are dated after Epstein was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a child.Recent revelations from the Epstein files include that Ferguson thanked the convicted sex offender for being the “brother” she “always wished for” in 2009, and that she “humbly”apologisedto her “dear friend” a month after publicly disowning him in 2011.Earlier this month, Ferguson’s charity Sarah’s Trustannouncedit would close “for the foreseeable future” after details of her relationship with Epstein emerged, while seven other charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust,cut ties and revoked Ferguson’s patronage.The publication of a new bookwas cancelled last autumn, leading to thousands of copies being pulped, after she was stripped of her royal divorcee title of the Duchess of York.A representative for the former duchess has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsSarah FergusonJeffrey EpsteinAndrew Mountbatten-WindsornewsShareReuse this content"

That is lower than the 69.3% rate in Malawi and just above Afghanistan’s 62% rate. The World Health Organization advises a 95% rate.The outbreak in Enfield has reignited public and medical anxiety about unvaccinated children gettingmeasles, which can damage the brain and lungs and in some cases lead to meningitis, blindness or even death. Five “catch-up clinics” have been set up in local community centres to vaccinate children who got either one or no doses of MMR when it was offered to their parents.‘We almost lost you in the night’ - the life-threatening rise of measles in the UKRead moreNHS England has been accused of displaying “complacency” for its failure to halt arelentless declineover the last decade in the number of five-year-old children who are fully vaccinated, from 88.2% to 83.7%.Ministers are under pressure to let pharmacies start administeringMMRjabs to infants so that they can supplement the immunisation programmes that GP surgeries and schools already run.In England, GP staff, mainly practice nurses, deliver the first and second doses of MMR to children when they are 12 and 18 months old. Schools also play a key role by hosting catch-up events at which unvaccinated and under-vaccinated pupils can get covered.Ben Coleman, a Labour MP on the Commons health and social care select committee, said: “The long-term decline in uptake of MMR and growing number of very worrying measles outbreaks, like the one in Enfield just now, show that that system is clearly failing.“That means that children are at risk of hospitalisation and even of dying from measles. Given that undervaccination poses real risks to public health, it’s time for the NHS to accept thatGPsand schools on their own appear not to be able to provide the 95% coverage the WHO rightly insists on. Pharmacies are somewhere families often visit and they’re being wasted as a resource. We can’t afford complacency.”A childdied of measleslast summer in Alder Hey children’s hospital in Liverpool amid an increase in cases in the city.The Royal College of Paediatrics and ChildHealth, which represents specialist children’s doctors, said pharmacies should be handed a role in offering vaccines. Prof Steve Turner, its president, said the change would help “make it faster and easier for parents and guardians to get their children vaccinated”.He said: “With appropriate training and support, enabling pharmacists to deliver MMR vaccines could be particularly helpful for families who have missed routine appointments or need to catch up on their children’s vaccinations.”The National Pharmacy Association also backed the call. “The decade-long reduction in uptake of MMR vaccinations among children is a sign that the current system is simply not working and needs urgent reviewing by the NHS,” said Olivier Picard, the trade body’s chair. “We need to work across the whole health service to perform this vital public health role, not leave it to one small part of it.”Helen Bedford, a vaccination expert and professor of child health at University College London, said pharmacies could help supplement existing NHS efforts to ensure better MMR uptake, especially as some schools – includingsome faith schools– do not take part in catch-up campaigns.“That may be because of disruption to studies or that they don’t see it as a priority. Or it may be about [their] views about vaccination generally,” she said.Coleman said MPs on the health committee sensed “complacency” among NHS bosses over falling MMR take-up when they gave evidence last week about trends in vaccination.At the hearing, Dr Mary Ramsay, the UK Health Security Agency’s director of public health programmes, admitted under questioning by Coleman that opposition among GPs to pharmacies being paid to perform a role currently undertaken by family doctors made that change difficult.The MP asked: “GPs might be annoyed if pharmacies can do it?” Ramsay replied: “That is an element.”The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) did not indicate if pharmacies might start delivering MMR jabs. Superdrug has said it would start providing MMR jabs if asked.Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at Oxford University, said of the Enfield outbreak there was “a real risk of further spread both locally and in other parts of London”, since the virus could easily spread in communities where less than 95% of people were vaccinated, as is the case in many parts of London.“When ‘enough’ people have been infected, the outbreak will die down, only to return again later when more unvaccinated children are born and the number who are susceptible has re-accumulated; there will be another explosive outbreak,” he said.A spokesperson for the DHSC said: “It is vital for anyone not yet vaccinated against MMR to do so as soon as possible. Not only does this ensure that you are protected, but also those around you.“To improve uptake and provide earlier protection against measles, from January children can have their second dose of MMR sooner. We’ve also introduced chickenpox protection into the childhood programme with the MMRV vaccine.“Low vaccination rates leave communities vulnerable, and we are taking urgent action with partners across London to boost MMR uptake and safeguard children’s health.”The government launched a campaign on Monday encouraging parents to ensure their children were up to date with all their vaccinations. It said childhood immunisations prevent about 5,000 deaths and 228,000 hospitalisations each year in England alone.Explore more on these topicsMMRVaccines and immunisationNHSGPsHealthHealth policyLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

In some cases this was because fertility clinics failed to notify those affected.In an unusual situation, the move was unopposed, with no objections from the clinics, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority or the health secretary.Mrs Justice Morgan ruled that it would be lawful in 14 of the 15 cases for the material to continue to be stored and used. She said laws around human fertilisation and embryology were “unbending” but “the rigidity of the scheme is not rigidity for its own sake”.She continued: “It is surely consent that is important, not consent by an immutable date. I find it hard to conclude that parliament intended the possibility of parenthood should be removed by the ticking of a clock, not in the cliched phrase, the ticking of the biological clock, but by the ticking of the clock beyond midnight of the day when existing consent expires, whatever might be the circumstances.”Under the law, fertility clinics need written consent from clients every decade to continue storing biological material. The rules are intended to prevent cells being kept or used without people’s knowledge or permission.Owing to delays and issues accessing fertility treatment during the pandemic, the law allowed for a two-year extension, meaning people using the service on 1 July 2020 were granted extra time.Confusion caused by the extension meant some clinic users were not notified when they needed to renew consent, so it lapsed.In the one case where the judge ruled against, the circumstances were legally different. Morgan said the pair involved had not originally consented to an embryo being stored but one had been retained accidentally and they now wished to use it.She said: “There was never, on their case, a consent to renew. To be permitted to take advantage of the storage of the embryo which they say ‘contradicted’ their express wishes because the clinic acted on the wrong consent form to change their mind is not in my judgment renewing consent. It is a change of consent.”Explore more on these topicsFertility problemsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

I recognise that many of the local councils undergoing reorganisation voiced genuine concerns about the pressure they are under as we seek to deliver the most ambitious reforms of local government in a generation.”Farage said Reed should resign as a result, while Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader,called the move“predictable chaos from a useless government that cannot make basic decisions”.Several Labour MPs also voiced anger at the decision, which they said showed there should never have been plans to delay the elections. “Most councillors feel devastated,” said one Labour MP for an affected area. “Many didn’t want to cancel the elections. They felt pressurised into it and didn’t feel they had the resources to deliver the planned local government reorganisation too.”View image in fullscreenReed said on Monday that ‘all local elections in May 2026 will now go ahead’.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Getty ImagesReed said on Monday that the government would give affected councils an extra £63m to cover the administrative costs, promising further support should they request it.Local leaders say they will now have to rehire venues as polling stations and find returning officers at short notice to be able to carry out the elections as demanded.“This most recent announcement means that 30 councils will now have to run elections within an even more constrained timetable,” the Local Government Information Unit said. “This risks the successful delivery of elections in all of these places, not to mention the additional strain it will needlessly add to the workloads of dedicated staff.”Officials said the decision had been taken because they received legal advice warning they were likely to lose the case against Farage, which was due to be heard on Thursday and Friday. The Reform leaderwas expected to arguethat the delays were “patently irrational” and contravened democratic and individual rights.Reed announced earlier this year that he had accepted applications from 30 local authorities to delay their elections because of the resources required to carry out the government’s planned local government reorganisation. That reorganisation will result in district and county councils being merged into unitary authorities in some areas, and neighbouring councils merged in others.One government source said the local government secretary was warned at the time the decision was likely to face a legal challenge. Only in recent days, however, did lawyers decide ministers were likely to lose that challenge.With days to go until the high court was due to hear Farage’s case, Reed turned the decision over to the housing minister, Matthew Pennycook, who advised the policy should be dropped. Government aides said this was a normal way for legally sensitive decisions to be taken. Those close to the prime minister say he was not involved in making the decision, but say he retains faith in Reed, one of his closest allies in government.The Conservatives are putting pressure on the government to publish the legal advice that prompted the U-turn, the latest in a series of policy reversals that also includes abandoning cuts to benefits and dropping plans for higher taxes for farmers. They are also demanding to know how much it could end up costing taxpayers beyond the additional funding announced by Reed on Monday and the expected legal costs.James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary, wrote in a letter to Reed on Monday: “There are now serious questions about your personal propriety as a minister … If you are unable or unwilling to answer these questions, you should resign.”That message was echoed by Farage, who told reporters at an event in Essex on Monday: “If a minister acts in a way that’s illegal and tries to cancel people’s democratic rights to vote whilst they’re still being charged their council tax, I personally think that it really is a resignation matter.”Reform believes it will be the biggest political winner from the decision, with the party targeting many of the areas in which elections will now be held in May. Farage said on Monday he believed voters in those parts of the country would “punish” the government when they got a chance to vote in May – a sentiment shared by some on the Labour benches.“Councillors feel like the rug has been taken from underneath them,” said one Labour MP. “Now they will have to face angry electors.”Explore more on these topicsLocal electionsLocal politicsLocal governmentEnglandKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

His killing came just two weeks after an immigration official shot and killed Renee Good and 10 days after the shooting of Julio C Sosa-Celis.On Monday, Minnesota’s bureau of criminal apprehension (BCA), a state-level criminal investigative law enforcement agency, said the FBI had formally notified it that it would not share any information or evidence related to Pretti’s shooting.ICE-free zones and blocked liquor licenses: US cities fight back against immigration raidsRead moreThe Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, has demanded an “impartial” investigation into the shootings inMinneapolis.“Trump’s left hand cannot investigate his right hand,” hesaidon Monday in response to the FBI’s refusal to share evidence. “The families of the deceased deserve better.”The BCA’s superintendent also expressed frustration.“While this lack of cooperation is concerning and unprecedented, the BCA is committed to thorough, independent and transparent investigations of these incidents, even if hampered by a lack of access to key information and evidence,”addedDrew Evans.He added that the agency remained committed to a joint investigation and said it would “continue to pursue all legal avenues to gain access to relevant information and evidence”.TheFBIdid not immediately respond to a request for comment.The agency has also previously refused to share any information related to the shootings of Good or Sosa-Celis, a lack of cooperation that led the BCA to stop its investigation into Good’s killing.“As we’ve previously said, full access to evidence, witnesses and information is necessary to meet the investigative standard that Minnesota law and the public demands; without it, we cannot do so,” the BCAsaidback in January, after the FBI boxed it out of the investigation.The Trump administration in December deployed federal officials to the Minneapolis area for an aggressive roundup of immigrants dubbed “Operation Metro Surge” that has seen a series of violent incidents as masked officials arrest people they claim to suspect lack proper residency documentation.Democrats and Republicans have both called on independent investigations into the Minneapolis shootings.Pretti, a nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs, was observing immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis when he was killed. Good was similarly an observer in Minneapolis, who was shot in her car by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer. Homeland security officials initially accused Good, 37, of “weaponizing” her vehicle, but local officials have disputed those claims.Both Pretti and Good were US citizens and video footage of their shootings has circulated widely, leading to mass protests.Sosa-Celis was shot by an ICE official in the leg last month. Trump administration officials initially claimed Sosa-Celis and two other men had “ambushed” the ICE officer who then “fired a defensive shot to defend his life”. But last week two ICE officials wereplaced on leavewhile they are investigated for allegedly lying under oath about the interaction.Explore more on these topicsMinnesota ICE shootingsFBIUS immigrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinneapolisMinnesotaUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

To me, he was simply everything. His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court. For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented. In doing so, he leaves something lasting and unforgettable to us all.”Duvall was perhaps best known for his role as the cavalry-hatted Kilgore inApocalypse Now, released in 1979, which yielded two of the most frequently quoted lines of dialogue in cinema history – “Charlie don’t surf!” and “I love the smell of napalm in the morning”. But he also made an immense impact as theconsigliereTom Hagen inThe GodfatherandThe Godfather Part II, the reclusive Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird at the start of his career, and many supporting and character roles throughout the ensuing decades. He was nominated seven times for an Oscar, winning once, for best actor in 1984 for Tender Mercies as a country-music singer trying to overcome alcoholism.Francis Ford Coppola, who directed Duvall inThe Godfatherfilms, The Rain People, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now, wrote on social media: “What a blow to learn of the loss of Robert Duvall. Such a great actor and such an essential part of [Coppola’s production company with George Lucas] American Zoetrope from its beginning.”Duvall’s Godfather co-star Al Pacino said it had been an honour to work with the actor. Pacino said: “He was a born actor as they say, his connection with it, his understanding and his phenomenal gift will always be remembered. I will miss him.”Robert De Niro, who played Duvall’s brother in the thriller True Confessions and also co-starred in The Godfather: Part II, wrote: “God bless Bobby. I hope I can live till I’m 95. May he rest in peace.”“The greatest consigliere the screen has ever seen,”​wrotethe actor Jamie Lee Curtis on social media, referring to Duvall’s role in the Godfather films as the Corleone family’s lawyer, Tom Hagen.​Adam Sandler, who acted alongside Duvall in Hustled (2022), ​​saidof Duvall: “Funny as hell. Strong as hell. One of the greatest actors we ever had. Such a great man to talk to and laugh with. Loved him so much. We all did. So many movies to choose from that were legendary. Watch them when you can.”Turner Classic Movies​paid tributeto the actor, saying “Duvall’s storytelling transcended mediums and generations of audiences” and the TCM host Ben Manckiewiczsaidit was “hard not to love everything about Robert Duvall’s work”.Born in San Diego, California, in 1931, the son of a naval officer, Duvall studied drama at college in St Louis, Missouri, and briefly joined the army. In 1955 he enrolled at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York (alongside James Caan, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman), sharing flats with Hackman and Hoffman. Duvall worked steadily in TV and theatre, including an award-winning role in a 1965 production of Arthur Miller’s A View from the Bridge, directed by Ulu Grosbard, and won his first film role as the mysterious Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird, released in 1962.View image in fullscreen‘Charlie don’t surf!’ … Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now.Photograph: Allstar/United ArtistsFurther small roles in Bullitt (1968) and True Grit (1969) consolidated his reputation, but it was his role inM*A*S*H– as the self-important Frank Burns, who is repeatedly mocked by Donald Sutherland’s Hawkeye and Elliott Gould’s Trapper John – that brought him to wider attention. Having appeared in Francis Ford Coppola’s feminist road movie The Rain People (1969), Duvall cemented his connection with the Hollywood new wave with the lead role in George Lucas’s 1970 debut feature, the dystopian sci-fi parable THX 1138; Tom Hagen in the first two Godfather films (he would ultimately not be cast in the third due to salary demands); and Kilgore in Apocalypse Now, in a role initially intended for Hackman.Duvall also continued to appear in more mainstream films, including the second world war thriller The Eagle Has Landed (1976), news-media satire Network (1976) and baseball drama The Natural (1984). He made his directorial debut in 1983 with Angelo My Love, a semi-improvised drama about a Romany street kid in New York. Despite his Oscar for Tender Mercies, lead roles rarely came his way, but he was a commanding supporting presence throughout the 80s and 90s, appearing in a wide range of films: the Dennis Hopper-directed gang thriller Colors, the Tom Cruise stock car blockbuster Days of Thunder (1990) and the Margaret Atwood adaptation The Handmaid’s Tale (1990).View image in fullscreenMulti-award-winning … Duvall, right, with Roshan Seth in the HBO’s Stalin.Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/NovofilmIn 1992, he returned to TV to play Stalin in an award-winning HBO filmdirected by Ivan Passer. Another lead role came his way in 1997, in his second directorial effort, The Apostle, in which he plays a preacher who kills his wife’s lover. He received his third best actor Oscar nomination for the role.Duvall would direct two more films – Assassination Tango in 2002, in which he displayed his real-life talent for the Argentinian dance style, and the westernWild Horsesin 2015. He continued to appear in a wide variety of films, from Hollywood thrillers such asThe Gingerbread ManandGone in 60 Seconds, to left-field dramas such asWe Own the NightandThe Road. A longtime interest in football (the “association” kind) led to roles in the low-budget Scottish dramaA Shot at Glory(opposite Ally McCoist) in 2000, and the comedy Kicking and Screaming (2005) with Will Ferrell.View image in fullscreenThe consigliere … Duvall, right, with Al Pacino in The Godfather Part II.Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar/ParamountDuvall continued working steadily through the 2010s, achieving another Oscar nomination for best supporting actor in 2015 forThe Judge, becoming at the time the oldest male actor ever nominated.One of Hollywood’s most prominent Republican supporters for decades, Duvall said he gave up supporting the party in 2014.Duvall was married four times: to Barbara Benjamin (1964-81), to Gail Youngs (1982-86), to Sharon Brophy (1991-95) and to Luciana Pedraza, whom he married in 2005.

The company told them there would be no bargaining and the plant would be closing.Workers say offshoring is an attack on the union, citing rhetoric that the plant has not been productive despite previous praise from company management.Union workers say Conn Selmer opened a facility inChinalast year and gradually shifted their workload to that plant, though workers were told the new facility would not affect workload in Ohio.“Almost immediately they started taking parts from certain product lines,” Hines said. He noted co-workers began complaining about brass metal coming from China that had to be scrapped due to poor quality.Paulson made a significant portion of his wealth bybettingagainst the housing market that crashed in 2008. A longtime Trump donor, he served on Trump’s economic policy team during his first presidential campaign and raised $50.5m for the president at his Palm Beach home in April 2024. He was in the running to serve as secretary of treasury during Trump’s second term butwithdrewbecause of “complex financial obligations”.Paulson, like Trump, has publicly criticized offshoring. “We can’t have American producers closing American factories and offshoring. We need to protect American jobs and protect American manufacturing,” he said during aninterviewwith CNBC in September 2024.Hines said offshoring the brass plant would be deeply offensive to workers after Paulson painted himself as an advocate for domestic manufacturing.“To go publicly on CNBC to support the Trump administration’s positive views on tariffs and all that stuff, and then you turn around and [say you] want to go send the work right over to China,” Hines said. “It’s a slap in our face.”But the union intends to keep fighting. Hines noted he hopes Trump steps in to stop the decision. “This decision can still be reversed,” he said.In early February, the union held arallyin Eastlake, Ohio, as part of efforts to save the plant from closing. It also released avideofeaturing workers at the plant criticizing the proposal to shut down the plant.“It really pisses me off,” said one worker in the video. “It leaves a hole in your heart,” said a second. “I feel betrayed,” added another.“They tell us we are the beating heart of this company,” said a worker in the video.The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment.A spokesperson for Conn Selmer did not comment on the criticisms from the union, though the company confirmed that if the “tentative decision is finalized”, it will transfer some instrument production offshore.The plant’s closure “will improve our competitiveness and better meet today’s market demands”, the company said. “We remain deeply committed to US manufacturing, as we have been for more than 150 years.”Workers are especially worried about the impact the plant’s closure will have on the community.“It’s going to take a lot of money out of Eastlake,” Hines said. “We’ve had people come out [and] show love to try to keep the place open, and the company just isn’t open to it. They’re not answering or returning anyone’s calls.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessUS unionsJohn PaulsonChinaOhionewsShareReuse this content"

In 2021, KPMG Australia wasfinedA$615,000 over “widespread” misconduct, after it was found that more than 1,100 partners had been involved in “improper answer-sharing” on tests designed to assess skill and integrity.UK accounting body to halt remote exams amid AI cheatingRead moreBut AI tools have introduced new possibilities for rule-breaking. InDecember, the UK’s largest accounting body, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), said it would require accounting students to take exams in person, because otherwise it was too difficult to stop AI cheating.Helen Brand, the chief executive of the ACCA, said at the time that AI tools had led to a “tipping point” as the use of them was outpacing safeguards against cheating put in place by the association.Firms such as KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers have also beenmandatingtheirstaffto use AI at work, reportedly in an effort to boost profits and cut costs.KPMG partners will reportedly be assessed on their ability to use AI tools during their 2026 performancereviews, with the firm’s global AI workforce lead, Niale Cleobury, saying: “We all have a responsibility to be bringing AI to all of our work.”Some commenters on LinkedIn noted the irony in using AI to cheat in AI training. KPMG is “fighting AI adoption instead of redesigning how they train people. This is a not a cheating problem – if we look at the new world order. This is a training problem,”wroteIwo Szapar, the creator of a platform that ranks organisations’ “AI maturity”.KPMG said it had adopted measures to identify the use of AI by its staff and would keep track of how many of its workers misused the technology.Andrew Yates, the chief executive of KPMG Australia, said: “Like most organisations, we have been grappling with the role and use of AI as it relates to internal training and testing. It’s a very hard thing to get on top of given how quickly society has embraced it.“Given the everyday use of these tools, some people breach our policy. We take it seriously when they do. We are also looking at ways to strengthen our approach in the current self-reporting regime.”Explore more on these topicsKPMGAccountancyAI (artificial intelligence)newsShareReuse this content"

Last week, Rhett Reese, the co-writer of Deadpool & Wolverine, Zombieland and Now You See Me: Now You Don’t, said “it’s likely over for us” after watching a widely disseminated AI-generated clip featuring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting.He added: “In next to no time, one person is going to be able to sit at a computer and create a movie indistinguishable from what Hollywood now releases. True, if that person is no good, it will suck. But if that person possesses Christopher Nolan’s talent and taste (and someone like that will rapidly come along), it will be tremendous.”The first iteration of Seedance launched in June last year.The Motion Picture Association, the Hollywood trade association that represents studios such as Paramount, Warner Bros and Netflix, accused ByteDance of “unauthorised use of US copyrighted works on a massive scale”. The actors’ union Sag-Aftra has accused Seedance of “blatant infringement”.It is the latest clash in Hollywood amid anxiety over the impact of AI on the future of entertainment. Artists and creative industries have called for compensation for theuse of their materialand the establishment of licensing frameworks to enable legal use of their content.Last year,Disney and NBCUniversal sued the AI image generator Midjourneyover what the studios claimed were “endless unauthorised copies” of their works.However, creative companies are also making deals with AI businesses. Last year,Disney announced a $1bn equity investment in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, and a three-year licensing agreement that enables its Sora video generation tool to use some of Disney’s characters.ByteDance and Walt Disney were approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)TikTokTechnology sectorWalt Disney CompanyFilm industryChinanewsShareReuse this content"

In an abrupt reversal of his long-stated plans,Marsis suddenly on the back burner. And getting US astronauts back on the lunar surface before the end of Donald Trump’s second term of office in three years’ time is the priority now, as well as keeping them there.“For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” Musk wrote Sundayon X, the social media platform he also owns.“The mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to the stars. SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster.”The post contained no mention of Trump, his on-again, off-again friend and political ally from Musk’schaotic tenureas head of the president’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) last year that upended numerous federal agencies without delivering the $2tn in savings he promised.But it is hard to separate Musk’s volte-face with the US president’s vainglorious quest, delivered in a Decemberexecutive ordertitled Ensuring American Space Supremacy, to see the Stars and Stripes planted on the moon during his presidency.Such an accomplishment would be, to phrase it mildly, a huge ask. Budget overruns and technical problems have significantly delayed Nasa’s Artemis program, and theArtemis 3moon landing, the first since the final Apollo mission in 1972, has been pushed back several times from its original target of 2024 to “by 2028”.Musk’s maneuver allows his company to direct more immediate resources to that mission, for which SpaceX is contracted to supply the human landing system (HLS) component.Even so, it has its work cut out.A leaked internal document,reported by Politicoin November, revealed a timeline at odds with that of Nasa, predicting a “boots on the moon” mission no earlier than September 2028, and only then “if all goes well” with preparatory missions.Those missions include an in-orbit fuel transfer between vehicles, and an un-crewed moon landing sometime in 2027 using a SpaceX Starship rocket. Asspace.comnoted in November, despite a series of promising test flights during 2025, Starship has yet to complete a successful orbital test flight.“The launch is the easiest part of all of this. Getting things into space, that’s the easy part. Landing is a lot harder, particularly landing on a different celestial body,” Casey Dreier, director of space policy at the Planetary Society,told the Guardianlast month.Ultimately Nasa, now under the stewardship of the billionaire private astronautJared Isaacman, Musk’s friend and ally, is expected to ditch thetroublesomeand expensive space launch system (SLS) that will power the space agency’s next two Artemis missions. Artemis 2 is currently at its Cape Canaveral launchpad in Florida, awaiting liftoff with a crew that will travel around the moon, but not land, as early as next month.That will open the door to an even closer partnership with private space enterprise, and Musk is eyeing future contracts for its own reusable Starship fleet that he envisions eventually traveling between Earth, the moon and Mars.For many, that financial incentive alone might be evidence enough to explain his switch of attention to the moon. But the entrepreneur is also wary of losing ground to his biggest rival, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his burgeoning Blue Origin company.From being streets behind Musk, Blue Origin - which holds a $3.4bn Nasa contract to supply the lander for the Artemis 5 mission scheduled for 2030 – has made huge strides in recent months. It made a statement in November with the firstsuccessful test flightof its New Glenn deep-space rocket, and announced two weeks ago that it wassuspendingits program of suborbital tourist space flights to shift resources to its lunar ambitions.Eric Berger, a space expert and senior writer for Ars Technica, said Blue Origin was “the one company with the potential to seriously challenge SpaceX in spaceflight over the next decade”.Inan analysispublished this week questioning why Musk appeared to have given up on Mars, Berger wrote: “Blue Origin might land humans on the moon before Starship, a threat sources at Starbase [the company’s Texas headquarters] say SpaceX is beginning to take seriously.”Berger also noted Musk’s increasing obsession with artificial intelligence, exemplified by his $1.25tnmerger earlier this monthof SpaceX with xAI, which includes the Grok chatbot and X, the social media platform.“A major focus of Musk going forward will be to construct orbital datacenters to provide enormous computing resources for his vision of humanity’s online future,” he said.“By focusing on the moon, Musk is making a decision that benefits Nasa and the US. Because for all of Blue Origin’s promise with aslimmed-down lunar lander, Starship offers a promising avenue to return humans to the moon in the near term.”Explore more on these topicsThe moonMarsSpaceElon MuskanalysisShareReuse this content"

Her victory at the Milano Cortina Games came down to the final run of the competition with Laura Nolte competing to best Meyers Taylor’s time of 3min 57.93 sec. But the German could not respond and Meyers Taylor became America’s oldest-ever female Winter Olympic champion.Ilia Malinin writes about ‘inevitable crash’ after Olympic figure skating shockRead moreNolte won silver and 40-year-old Kaillie Armbruster Humphries of the US, who was also competing in her fifth Olympics, claimed bronze.Meyers Taylor was the most decorated Black athlete ever at aWinter Olympicseven before this win and also is a four-time world champion. This Olympic medal, her sixth, tied speed skater Bonnie Blair for the most by a US woman in a Winter Games career.Armbruster Humphries won gold in the inaugural running of monobob at the 2022 Beijing Games, with Meyers Taylor winning silver. Monday’s results means they became the first women in their 40s to win medals in women’s Olympic bobsled history. They also reached the podium in each of their previous four appearances at the Winter Games; Armbruster Humphries was on the Canadian Olympic team in 2006 but did not race in those Turin Games.

But there are signs an updated version may have workedAR Shawat Intuit Dome, InglewoodMon 16 Feb 2026 09.38 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 11.31 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleBasketball Hall of Famer Tracy McGrady flashed a look of disdain when recalling last year’s NBA All-Star Game.“The All-Star Game that we witnessed last year was not an All-Star game,” McGrady told the Guardian. “I don’t know what that was.”Prior to Sunday night’s contest, the All-Star Game had experienced years of disarray. In an attempt to make the game more competitive, the league replaced the classic East v West matchup and tinkered with multiple formats, including a playground-style selection process with team captains (Team LeBron v Team Stephen). Last year’s four-team tournament that featured a squad of Rising Stars who weren’t yet close to being actual All-Stars.The results led to glorified shoot-arounds as players gave minimum effort on both sides of the court, eschewing defense while attempting a multitude of uncontested three-point shots and dunks.From the foul line to the fault line: Deni Avdija, Israel and the collapse of online nuanceRead moreIn the latest move to increase competition, theNBAsought to entice players with something bigger to play for: global respect. Hence, this year’s “USA v World” format, which featured a three-team tournament between the up-and-coming Team USA Stars, the veterans of Team USA Stripes and international players of Team World. The round-robin format included four 12-minute games and an overtime with a target score of five.American-born players once held an imperialistic grip on basketball, particularly during the Dream Team era – Team USA defeated opponents by an average score of 43.8 points at the 1992 Olympics. But the gap between US and international players is closing each year. During the 2024 Paris Olympics, Team USA needed herculean efforts by LeBron James and Stephen Curryto hold off Francein the final minutes of the gold-medal game. And in the NBA, international players have won every MVP award since 2018, with James Harden the last American-born player to capture the league’s most coveted individual prize.“The conversation that the international players caught up to us, the American players hear that,” McGrady said prior to Sunday’s tip-off. “It’s not the platform. It’s not the format. It’s the players that change that. So I think mixing it up like this, the world’s going to set the tone, and we’re going to see competitive basketball.” ​Kevin Durant struck a more conciliatory tone on Saturday. He said that some All-Star games were just as lethargic decades ago.“I just feel like fans and the media need something to complain about,” said Durant, who was making his 16th All-Star appearance. “I don’t think it’s that big of a deal, to be honest. … The last couple of weeks, I’ve watched the intro and at least the first quarter of every All-Star Game from, like, the 70s up until the late 90s. I wanted to see what the big deal was and if it was really that much intensity, like an [NBA finals] Game 7. The intensity the older generation has been talking about, I don’t know if I’ve seen it.”During last year’s game, Victor Wembanyama appeared upset after his teammate Alperen Sengun allowed Jayson Tatum to throw down an uncontested game-winning dunk. Before this year’s game, the Frenchman said that the USA v World format should encourage the All-Stars to play for pride.“We’ve seen that many of the best players have been increasingly foreign players,” Wembanyama said. “There is some pride on that side. I guess there is pride on the American side, which is normal. So I think anything that gets you closer to representing your country brings up pride.”On Sunday, Wembanyama set the tone early by scoring the first seven points for Team World and finishing with a combined stat line of 33 points, eight rebounds, and three blocks in two games.​ His show of effort inspired other players to pick up the intensity, most notably, the 2026 All-Star Game MVP, Anthony Edwards.“Wemby set the tone, and it woke me up for sure,” Edwards said after Sunday’s games. “It was definitely competitive with all three teams. I feel like the old heads [Team Stripes] played hard too. They were playing really good defense.”From tip-off of the first game, this year’s All-Star Game (or, technically, games) had a different energy. Players from Team Stars and Team World contested shots on defense, and embraced motion offense instead of a reliance on one-on-one scoring. In the final, the youthful Team Stars dismantled Team Stripes by a score of 47-21, led by Edwards, who finished with 32 points in three games.Despite the rout, the players competed with purpose, and the league may have finally fixed a longstanding problem.“I think it was definitely a step up in the competitive department compared to last season,” Durant said after the final game. “Hopefully, we just build upon this, and the weekend becomes more and more competitive. And the fans start to enjoy it more and more.”Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Haji Wright hit a timely hat-trick as Coventry again traded places withMiddlesbrough, whose six-game winning run came to an abrupt halt, to renew belief in these parts.Riley McGree pulled a goal back midway through the second half but from the restart Boro conceded a penalty that allowed Wright to claim the match ball. Coventry’s lead may be a single point but this felt a significant victory, psychologically as much as anything, their having taken just 16 from the previous available 39. “There have been quite a few questions asked and I think the lads should get a lot of credit,” Lampard said. “It was a big game, a really good game, which probably showed why we are one and two in the league.

On this evidence, while Hellberg bemoaned the manner of the goals Boro conceded, his team will surely run Coventry close as the pair fight for automatic promotion. “There are 14 games left to play and it’s going to be a battle,” Hellberg said. “It will probably be a race until the last day.”There was a big-game energy in the moments before kick-off: fireworks shooting into the sky, pyrotechnics sparkling and the Enemy, the Coventry band whose We’ll Live and Die in These Towns has been adopted as a club anthem, blaring. The match itself was entertaining from the first whistle, Tommy Conway bounding into Joel Latibeaudiere after Coventry got things under way on halfway and Wright sent a header against a post inside 99 seconds, rising above Luke Ayling to flick Tatsuhiro Sakamoto’s floated cross towards goal. It was a breathless contest between not only first v second in the second tier but also the teams with the best home and away records in the division.Coventry came into this game winless in three matches and fresh from beingheld to a 0-0 drawat home to struggling Oxford United. They seized the advantage on 21 minutes. Wright started and finished the move but the true catalyst was Sakamoto, who twirled clear of Conway and then Hayden Hackney before locating Jack Rudoni who squared the ball. Wright’s first-time finish went through the legs of the Boro goalkeeper Sol Brynn.View image in fullscreenHaji Wright fires Coventry ahead during the first half.Photograph: Ryan Browne/ShutterstockLampard’s side looked to Carl Rushworth’s booming kicks to put Boro’s back line under pressure and approaching the hour the hosts doubled their lead in direct fashion. The on-loan Brighton goalkeeper wellied the ball downfield and as it bounced 20 yards from the Boro goal, it became clear that Ayling was in a spot of bother. When the ball bounced a second time, Wright sent a nerveless finish into the far corner of Brynn’s net.Hackney vented his frustrations after the referee, Thomas Bramall, inadvertently prevented Boro shifting the ball through the middle of the pitch. Boro had begun the second half encouragingly, Morgan Whittaker heading over from a McGree cross and Rushworth held an effort by Hackney after an intricate move. Hellberg freshened things up by introducing Jeremy Sarmiento and David Strelec and within a couple of minutes Boro hit the woodwork themselves when Sarmiento cracked a curling shot against a post.Eventually Boro got their reward, McGree lashing in on the half-volley but the joy proved short-lived. Within 17 seconds of the restart Matt Targett was penalised for handling a cross from the Coventry substitute Josh Eccles and the hosts restored their two-goal cushion. Eccles held the ball before handing it over for Wright to do the rest from the spot.“We can’t over celebrate,” Lampard said, mindful of back-to-back games at West Brom and Sheffield United on the horizon.“There are so many points to fight for. We’ve got ourselves in this position, Boro are there, Ipswich are always going to be there because of their squad and the coach, there’s other teams around it, Millwall etc. It’s game on.”Explore more on these topicsChampionshipCoventry CityMiddlesbroughmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I don’t think people should be dying in the streets just for existing. I don’t like what’s going on,” Gauff said in Dubai on Sunday, referring to the killings of Alex Pretti and Renee Nicole Good by federal agents in Minnesota.“I think for me, it is tough to sometimes wake up and see something because I do care a lot about our country. I think people think I don’t for some reason, but I do. I’m very proud to be American.“But I think when you’re from any country, you don’t have to represent the entire values of what’s going on in the leadership. I think there’s a lot of people around there who believe in the things I believe in, and believe in diversity and equality. So, I’m hoping as the future progresses that we can get back to those values.”Activism runs in Gauff’s DNA. Her maternal grandmother Yvonne Lee Odomhelped desegregate public schoolsin Delray Beach in the 1960s, and she has passed on her experiences and values to Gauff.For a long time, Gauff has shunned the “shut up and dribble” rhetoric that has been thrown at athletes who dare to speak out on social and political matters.At 16, she stood in a Black Lives Matter rally in her home town andgave a stirring speechin which she urged people to take action, exercise their right to vote and speak up for social justice.“The silence of the good people is worse than the brutality of the bad people,” she said that day, quoting Martin Luther King Jr, as her grandmother watched.Gauff has also spoken out against the killing of innocent civilians in Gaza, telling the National News in an interview two years ago, “It’s important for us as privileged civilians to do our research and just continuing to demand our leaders to make change and I will never not advocate for that.”The two-time grand slam champion is often asked to weigh in on social and political issues, and insists she will never shy away from answering them.“I never felt torn when I’m asked a question because it is relevant. If you’re asking me, I’ll going to tell you how I feel,” she said on Sunday.“I think a lot of people on social media, on the other hand, like to say to stay out of politics, stay out of the things that are going on.“You’re going to be asked these things in press. People want to hear our opinion on it. Some players choose to say ‘no comment’, which is also completely in their right. I understand that. Some prefer to state their opinion.“I think the biggest thing I hate is when people say, ‘stay out of it’, when we’re being asked it. If you ask me, I’m going to give you my honest answer.“When I’m asked, I have no problems. Because I’ve lived this. My grandma literally is an activist. This is literally my life. So I’m OK answering tough questions.”Gauff, the world No 4, will kick off her Dubai campaign against Anna Kalinskaya on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsCoco GauffTennisUS sportsTrump administrationMinnesota ICE shootingsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Americans brushed aside Sweden 5-0 in the first of Monday’s semi-finals, setting the stage for a seventh gold-medal showdown with Canada, who held on for a closer-than-expected 2-1 win over Switzerland in the nightcap.Twenty years ago, almost to the day, the USA women absorbedone of the great Olympic shockswhen Sweden stunned them at the same stage in a shootout just down the A4 autostrada in Torino, ending a streak of 25 straight losses to the Americans during which they’d been outscored 187-29. There would be no such ambush this time, even if Sweden coach Ulf Lundberg had suggested the US team were “just human beings” and might not have been overly keen on facing his team in the semi-finals.‘That’s hockey’: Canada’s Wilson shuns Olympic tradition and brawls during win over FranceRead moreThe US dominated possession from the opening faceoff and struck first after six minutes when defender Cayla Barnes whipped a snap shot from the edge of the right circle into the top-right corner, marking the sixth straight game in which the Americans have scored in the opening period.Quick Guide2026 US Olympic women's hockey teamShowScheduleAll times Eastern.Thu 5 FebUSA 5-1 CzechiaSat 7 FebUSA 5-0 FinlandMon 9 FebSwitzerland 0-5 USATue 10 FebCanada 0-5 USAFri 13 FebQuarter-final: USA 6-0 ItalyMon 16 FebSemi-final: USA 5-0 SwedenThu 19 FebGold-medal game v Canada/Switzerland, 1.10pmRoster breakdownThe 2026 US Olympic women's ice hockey team features 23 players, 13 forwards, seven defenders and three goaltenders, and boasts 21 returnees from the 2025 US women's national teamthat took home goldat the 2025 IIHF Women's World Championship in April. Eleven of the 23 have prior Olympic experience.Captain AmericaHilary Knight (Sun Valley, Idaho) is the captain of Team USA for the 2026 Olympic Winter Games. Forward Alex Carpenter (North Reading, Massachusetts) and defender Megan Keller (Farmington Hills, Michigan) are alternate captains.Behind the benchJohn Wroblewski is the head coach of the 2026 US Olympic women's ice hockey team.

Then Abbey Murphy and Kendall Coyne Schofield scored in a 58-second span, prompting Lundberg to pull first-choice goaltender Ebba Svensson Traff for Emma Söderberg. Less than two minutes later, Hayley Scamurra tapped in Britta Curl-Salemme’s centering pass to make it 5-0, all but sealing the Americans’ fifth straight appearance in the Olympic final.“We’ve just been taking it game by game, period by period, shift by shift,” said Coyne Schofield, who is playing in her fourth Olympics. “Just focusing on what we did well and what we can improve on. It’s a big win tonight and we’re right where we want to be going into the gold-medal game.”US goaltender Aerin Frankel was brilliant when called upon, turning away 23 shots for her fourth win and third shutout of the tournament. The 26-year-old Olympic debutante plus backups Gwyneth Philips and Ava McNaughton have combined for five straight clean sheets and an Olympic-record scoreless streak of more than 331 straight minutes entering Thursday’s final.“The team is playing so well defensively they are making my job easy by making the plays in front of me so predictable so I can do my job,” Frankel said. “It’s hard to zoom out while you’re here and look at the big picture. When we look back on this tournament, what we have done so far has been amazing. But the job is not done yet.”The Americans’ defensive dominance has almost been overshadowed by their high-octane attack – 31 goals, 259 shots on goal and 15 different goalscorers through six games – but the ability to roll four lines and attack relentlessly starts with security in net. The US have conceded just the one goal and have yet to trail or be tied after 0-0 throughout the competition.Along the concourses ofthe brand-new 14,700-seat arenaon Milan’s south-eastern edge, hordes of well-lubricated US supporters in hockey sweaters, bald eagle costumes and every variety of star-spangled regalia waved flags and stacked pyramids from €7 pony beers as “U-S-A!” chants echoed before, during and after the goals.View image in fullscreenCanada captain Marie-Philip Poulin scored both of her team’s goals in their 2-1 semi-final win over Switzerland.Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty ImagesMany of them stuck around to watch Canada reach their eighth straight Olympic final by seeing off Switzerland behind two goals from captain Marie-Philip Poulin. The 34-year-old from Quebec, slowed by a lower-body injury during the tournament but still considered the best player on the planet, took over the all-time Olympic goalscoring record held by Canadian Hayley Wickenheiser with her 19th goal before extending it with a 20th.The US will go off as hot favorites in Thursday’s final on merit. With only 11 returning players from the teamthat won silver in Beijingfour years ago – including seven who are still in college – they have one of their youngest and fastest teams in years. Since dethroning the Canadians at last year’s world championshipson Tessa Janecke’s overtime goal, the US have won five straight in the head-to-head by a 29-7 margin, includinga 5-0 group-stage win last Tuesday.The two teams have split all seven Olympic gold medals since women’s ice hockey debuted at Nagano, with the US winning in 1998 and 2018 and Canada claiming the other five. While the Americans’ rich blend of youthful swagger and veteran poise should give them the upper hand, the Canadians will take heart in the presence of Poulin, who has notched seven of her goals in four Olympic gold medal games – earning her the nickname Captain Clutch – and remains the only man or woman to score in four separate finals.“We haven’t won against them this year, and we’re ready to take that and heartbreak them,” Canada forward Julia Gosling said. “It’s a gold-medal game so anything can happen. If we can bring the performance like we did tonight we can just push through. If we win every battle, scratch and claw, we are going to come out on top.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsIce hockeyUSA ice hockey teamUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Shaidorov won gold and Malinin finished 15th out of 24th in the free skate and eighth overall.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

The video ends with the message “21 February 2026”, the date of the exhibition gala that traditionally concludes the Olympic figure skating schedule, perhaps suggesting Malinin’s routine will be based on his recent experiences.Fall of the Quad God: Ilia Malinin finds he is all too human under the Olympic spotlightRead moreA written message alongside the video also hints atthe pressures Malinin facedin the run-up to last Friday’s routine.“On the world’s biggest stage, those who appear the strongest may still be fighting invisible battles on the inside,” Malinin wrote alongside the video. “Even your happiest memories can end up tainted by the noise. Vile online hatred attacks the mind and fear lures it into the darkness, no matter how hard you try to stay sane through the endless insurmountable pressure. It all builds up as these moments flash before your eyes, resulting in an inevitable crash. This is that version of the story.”The final title card of the video includes a book called The Psychology of Fear as well as images of computer keyboards and text messages.Malinin was quick to congratulate Shaidorov after the competition, which resulted in his worst score since the US International Classic in September 2022. He also was honest about how the pressure had affected him at the Olympics.“The nerves just went, so overwhelming,” he said, “and especially going into that starting pose, I just felt like all the traumatic moments of my life really just started flooding my head. So many negative thoughts that flooded into there and I could not handle it.”Malinin did not come away from the Olympics empty-handed.He won team goldwith the United States during the opening weekend of the Games.Explore more on these topicsIlia MalininWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsFigure skatingUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But as a thrilling big air competition reached its denouement, an Italian with no anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee came down a 180‑feet ramp and drove a stake through the Briton’s heart.It all looked so promising when the 21-year-old from Aberdeen landed a stunning left double 1620, with four and a half rotations, to move into the medal positions after two of the three rounds. However, with just four jumps of the competition remaining, Flora Tabanelli, who tore her ACL in November, did the same trick as Muir but only better to score 94.25 points to steal the bronze medal.“It was a little bit bittersweet,” said Muir, who fell on her final jump and finished fourth. “I didn’t know what she did, but I knew it bumped my score by a decent amount and therefore I really did have to go for it. I gave it my all and I’m taking that with me.”Muir was right to hold her head high. After a competition that was delayed 75 minutes because of heavy snow and high winds, she played a blinder – only to find three women performing even better in a competition for the ages. Having also come close in Beijing, when she was just 17, she will hope it is third time lucky in 2030.The Canadian Megan Oldham deservedly took gold with a score of 180.75, with China’s Eileen Gu second with 179 and Tabanelli third on 178.25. Muir was 3.5pts back in fourth. It was her second time in eight days that the Scot had finished fourth, after she missed outin the women’s freeski slopestyleby 0.45pts.Earlier, Dave Ryding zigged and zagged for a fifth and final time at aWinter Olympicsbefore announcing his retirement. “I said I would ski race until my legs fall off and I think they pretty much have,” he said.Ryding’s 17th-placed finish in the men’s slalom in Bormio was not quite the swansong the 39-year-old had intended. But sometimes legacy matters as much as medals. He leaves the slopes as undoubtedly Britain’s greatest skier, after an unlikely journey that started by dodging sheep on a 50m dry-ski slope in Pendle, Lancashire.View image in fullscreenBritain’s Dave Ryding finished in 17th place in the men’s slalom.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I did it a totally different way and you probably say it was a one in a million shot,” he said. “But I proved that you can do it.”UK Sport may think differently, but not all Winter Olympic events are created equal. In some sports, having a technical advantage gives a competitor one hand on a medal before they even start; while in others, such as slalom skiing, the heritage and depth of competition matters. So when Ryding became the only Briton to win a World Cup skiing event, in Kitzbühel four years ago, it really cut through.“Five-time Olympian, World Cup winner – I really can’t ask for much more,” he said. “The icing on the cake would have been to pull something out today. I just didn’t quite have it to be honest. But I will never look back thinking: ‘Did I stop too soon?’ I gave it my all until the last gate.”As Ryding watched, Loïc Meillard became Switzerland’s first men’s Olympic slalom champion since 1948 after the first-run leader, Atle Lie McGrath, straddled a gate in his second run.And while skiing has a reputation in Britain for being a posh sport, Ryding is anything but. His dad was a market trader, his mother a hairdresser.When he started at the age of six, sometimes the sheep would run across him while he was training. On other occasions they would leave excrement that would cause him to slip.He had to struggle to make his fifth Olympics too. In 2022, UK Sport completely cut skiing’s funding; while it then relented and gave Ryding £80,000 a year, he decided it would be better spent helping his teammates, including Billy Major, who finished 16th, travel to events.While he is retiring, Ryding says he wants to bring through the next wave of British skiers and help them become World Cup winners.“I would put a bit of money on it saying that it is possible,” he said. “We have Youth Olympic and world junior championship medals so the next generation is amazing. I really hope UK Sport sees that and get behind them.”Ryding has already set his sights on a new target: lowering his parkrun personal best of 16min 54sec. “For sure, I don’t think I’ll get a dad bod too soon,” he said, smiling as he waved a final goodbye.Elsewhere, the British men’s and women’s curlers are in danger of missing out on the semi-finals after losing on Monday. Team GB’s men lost 7-6 against Norway, while the women were downed 6-10 by Switzerland.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

TheItalyteam captain, Klaus Hoellrigl, said on Friday that he was considering including her in the foursome for the event.On Friday, the national anti-doping organisation of Italy (Nado Italia) upheld Passler’s appeal against a provisional suspension that followed a positive test for the banned substance letrozole on 26 January.In her appeal, the 24-year-old said she lived with her mother who was taking letrozole as part of her treatment for breast cancer and that the contamination likely came from a spoon which she used to eat some Nutella hazelnut spread for breakfast the day before the test.The World Anti-Doping Agency noted that the decision to clear Passler was only provisional, with a tribunal to be established by Nado Italia to hear the full case at a later date.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsItalynewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday afternoon in Bormio, the Norwegian Atle Lie McGrath processed his grief in a novel way after the men’s slalom gold medal had slipped away. First, he threw his ski poles as far as he could and then he hid in the woods.“I just needed to get away from everything,” he said. “I thought I would get some peace and quiet, which I didn’t because photographers and police found me out in the woods. I just needed some time for myself.”Winter Olympics 2026: women’s big air final under way after weather delay, USA reach women’s ice hockey final – liveRead moreHis reaction was entirely understandable. The 25-year-old had hoped to honour his grandfather, who died on the day of the opening ceremony. Despite skiing in a blizzard, his opening run was smooth and clinical as he stopped the clock on 56.14sec.That gave him an advantage of 0.59 over the Swiss world champion, Loïc Meillard, into the second leg. Several of his rivals – including Lucas Pinheiro Braathen, whowon the giant slalomto give Brazil a first Winter Olympic medal in their history – had crashed out.It was there for the taking, but then it all went horribly wrong as McGrath straddled a gate. “I’m normally a guy that’s very good when it comes to perspective on things,” he said.View image in fullscreenAtle Lie McGrath trudges off the course after crashing out during the second run.Photograph: Alexis Boichard/Agence Zoom/Getty Images“If I don’t ski well in a race, I can at least tell myself that I’m healthy and my family’s healthy and the people I love are here. So that’s nice, but that’s not been the case. I’ve lost someone I love so much and that makes it really hard.”The ski poles went. TV footage then showed him lying on his back, occasionally putting his hands over his face, on the side of the course, before he trudged into the woods.View image in fullscreenBritain’s Dave Ryding waves to the crowd after his final Olympic run.Photograph: The Guardian“A mix of shock and everything in between,” he said. “I haven’t really experienced anything like it before. It’s not the worst moment of my life, but it’s the worst moment of my career. I was hoping I was going to be able to crown off this tough period with something good today.“I had to really stand through so much tough stuff and stay really strong. That makes it an extra tough one.”McGrath, who was born in Vermont and moved to Norway when he was two with his American father, Felix, and Norwegian mother, Selma Lie, denied his grandfather’s death had had a negative effect on his skiing. “With everything that’s been going on, I’ve really struggled to handle myself these past two weeks and I was so proud of my first run today,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe Winter Olympic stoat mascot, Tina, helps out with shovelling snow during heavy snowfall before the men’s slalom.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/Reuters“It’s affected me a tremendous amount, but it did not affect my focus. I honestly think he was the only reason why I was able to lead the first run and lead by so much. It takes a lot of courage and it’s really tough to stand there and think of him and want to perform when everything feels so small.”His mistake meant that victory went to Meillard, who became the first Swiss men’s Olympic slalom champion since 1948 with a combined time of 1min 53.61sec, and he had a few words of consolation for McGrath. “Atle Lie would have deserved it as well.

Britain’s Dave Ryding ended his career with a 17th-place finish in his fifthWinter Olympics, while his compatriot Billy Major was 16th.McGrath, though, was left to contemplate what might have been. “It’s hard to think that the next time I’ll be able to ski the Olympics, I will be 29 years old,” he said. “I gave myself the absolute best opportunity you could today. I skied so great and I still couldn’t get it done. That’s what really hurts.“I need quite a bit of time to process this and it’s going to be extremely tough. We’ll see how it goes, but at least I’m surrounded by great people who love me and who I love. I’m happy they’ll be here for me.“I’ve spent my time in the woods, now I’m going to spend time with the people I love, and that’s all I need.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBSkiingnewsShareReuse this content"

Italian police have reportedly advised him not to leave his home.La Pennasparked fury among Juventus fansafter dismissing Pierre Kalulu, showing the defender a second yellow card for a challenge on Alessandro Bastoni. Replays showedBastoni had clearly simulatedthe fall. Juventus officials and fans argued that the decision heavily influenced the game, which Inter won 3-2, despite theBianconerihaving fought back to level the score with 10 men.Juventus red card fury overshadows thrilling Derby d’Italia battle with Inter | Nicky BandiniRead moreAfter the match, La Penna was subjected to abarrage of abuse on social media, including dozens of death threats – some directed at his family –with users posting messagessuch as: “I’ll shoot you;” “I’ll kill you;” and: “We’re coming to get you, we know where you live.”The referee has filed a formal complaint over the online attacks and, according to several Italian outlets includingLa RepubblicaandSportMediaset, police have advised him to remain at home for the time being.According to sources within the Italian referees’ association (AIA), La Penna could face a one-month suspension. Reports from figures close to the AIA suggest he could be stood down after what the Serie A chief refereeing officer, Gianluca Rocchi, described as“a clearly wrong decision”.Juventus players appealed desperately for a video assistant referee intervention, but officials are not permitted to review second yellow cards. Bastoni, already on a booking, should have received a second yellow card for simulation.“La Penna is mortified and we stand by him, but I have to tell you the truth: he wasn’t the only one who made a mistake,”Rocchi said via the AIA. “Yesterday there was a clear simulation – the latest in a long series in a league where they try in every possible way to deceive us.”Bastoni was also subjected to abuse online, prompting the defender and his wifeto disable comments on his social media accounts. He had celebrated after Kalulu’s dismissal, a gesture some supporters deemed unsporting, leading to calls for him to be dropped from the Italy squad.“You can’t talk about football today,” said the former Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini, Juventus’s director of football strategy. “Something unacceptable happened.”At half-time, the club’s chief executive, Damien Comolli, had to berestrained from confronting La Penna. The Juventus manager, Luciano Spalletti, was also seen remonstrating with the referee as the teams headed down the tunnel, though he appeared to recognise the situation was spiralling when Comolli arrived, turning to push him away.“Juventus lost three points, but Italian football lost much more,” Comolli said. Comolli and Chiellini risk disciplinary sanctions.Piotr Zielinski scored Inter’s winner from the edge of the area in the 90th minute, seven minutes after Manuel Locatelli had equalised.Explore more on these topicsSerie ARefereesJuventusInternazionaleEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

After the Guardian published its story, the Union placed Tanner on administrative leave and MLSreopened an investigationinto his behavior that had been closed early in 2025 due to lack of corroboration. Tanner has denied the allegations throughout, saying he will cooperate fully with the league as he “[works] to clear my good name and reputation”.MLS’s initial investigation was done using in-house counsel, but the league has retained labor law firm Littler Mendelson to handle the new investigation, said multiple sources with direct knowledge of it, who like all sources in this report spoke to the Guardian under the condition of anonymity. Littler Mendelson is a global law firm specializing in labor and employment law. Among other notable clients, the firm has represented Starbucks, Amazon and Delta Air Lines in their anti-unionization efforts.However, the investigation has not reached any conclusion in the three months since it was reopened. The Guardian understands that part of the reason for the delay is that investigators had reached an impasse regarding non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that remain in effect between some potential sources and the Union.It is somewhat common for MLS clubs to have departing employees sign NDAs, which generally prohibit them from speaking about their experiences at their previous employer. Multiple sources with knowledge of the ongoing investigation into Tanner have said that, because of these types of agreements, some potential interviewees have not received adequate assurances from investigators that they won’t be subject to legal action if they participate.The Guardian understands that MLS had hoped a new investigation would work around any existing NDAs, with the league previously offering assurances to potential sources in its initial effort. Two sources familiar with the ongoing investigation told the Guardian last week that multiple potential sources in the investigation do not feel that they’ve received adequate assurance that they’d be released from the conditions of those agreements.“Any individual under an NDA with the Philadelphia Union has been granted, or would be granted upon request, a release to fully participate in the investigation,” A Union spokesperson wrote in a statement to the Guardian. MLS deferred comment to Littler Mendelson.“We have engaged – and continue to engage – with individuals subject to nondisclosure agreements, and are taking appropriate steps to facilitate their participation in this investigative process,” Littler shareholder Kris Derewicz wrote in a statement to the Guardian. “As this is an ongoing investigation, we are not at liberty to provide any additional details.”Tanner was put on leave on 19 November and has since largely spent his time in his native Germany, sources familiar with the Union’s front office operations said last week. The Union’s front office has been active in recent weeks, adding players from Colombia and Denmark while unloading others within and outside MLS. A league source with direct knowledge of one of those transfers told the Guardian that Tanner was not involved in negotiations surrounding that player, with talks handled instead by Union owner Jay Sugarman alongside assistant sporting director Matt Ratajczak.Since his arrival in MLS in 2018, Tanner has been widely considered among the league’s most successful sporting directors, having helped craft a series of perennially competitive Union sides on a barebones budget. Unlike other global leagues, MLS has a soft salary cap and complex system of roster rules and regulations designed to allow even the league’s smallest teams to be competitive. Tanner had proved a good match for Philadelphia, who have often been among the league’s thriftiest teams.Prior to his arrival, the Union had qualified for the MLS playoffs only twice in their eight-year history. Under Tanner, Philadelphia have made the postseason every year except 2024 and reached the 2022 MLS Cup final, a performance that earned Tanner the league’s executive of the year award.Sporting directors at MLS clubs have varying degrees of power; at the Union, Tanner oversees nearly every facet of the club’s sporting operations at a granular level, working closely with the club’s youth academy. That youth setup has produced multiple US national team members and has frequently provided the Union with a valuable income stream via outgoing transfers, with Philadelphia raking in about $43m in player sales under Tanner’s watch.Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia UnionMLSUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The announcement came a week after compatriot Joshua wasinvolved in a car crashin Nigeria which killed his close friends Sina Ghami and Latif “Latz” Ayodele.Any plans for Fury and Joshua to finally fight in 2026 have since been delayed, but Fury did acknowledge the part played by his old rival in his latest comeback. “Tomorrow might not ever come and I suppose the biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened withAnthony Joshua,” Fury said at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.“I was on holiday with my family in Thailand for Christmas just to get away from the rain. I was sick of the rain, it was depressing me and then I hear all about the bad news that’s gone on and I thought: ‘You know what, life is very, very short and very precious and very fragile and anything can happen at any given moment.’“You should never put things off until tomorrow, or next year, or next week because tomorrow is not promised to nobody. The Bible says tomorrow is not a gift, tomorrow ain’t promised, tomorrow is a mystery so we have to live for today.“Me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then I was going to come back to boxing because it’s something I love, I am passionate about and I have always been in love with.

Both decisions were entirely explicable in their own terms. Frank had won only two of his previous 17 league games and Dyche only two of his previous 10. Both saw the improvement of West Ham under Nuno Espírito Santo and felt the drag of potential relegation. When fear sets in and something has to change, football tends to sacrifice the manager.Excluding caretakers and interims, their departures take the number of Premier League managers to leave their jobs this season to eight, withOliver Glasner to comeat the end of the season, when Marco Silva and Andoni Iraola are also out of contract. Last season there were 10 departures, in 2023-24 nine, in 2022-23 an absurd 18. To give a little context, in the first season of the Premier League, 1992-93, there were only four changes (five if you include Dave Webb at Chelsea, who was effectively an interim, although he did not officially have that title). The average life span of a Premier League manager has dropped from about four seasons to about a season and a half.Tottenham job has become a public meat grinder and the fans’ pain is more content | Barney RonayRead moreVolatility is just part of the game. English football used to laugh at the chaotic world of Italy, but has adopted the idea of the “ferryman” who will pilot a club to the end of the season; pretty much every article describing Igor Tudor, who will lead Tottenham through to the summer, dutifully explained that he is what Italians term a “un traghettatore”.In part, it’s a general condition – and the average reign of a Premier League manager would be shorter were it not for Pep Guardiola and his decade at Manchester City – but Spurs and Forest, perhaps, represent particular cases. Tottenham have started to look unmanageable, having cycled through six permanent managers (and four interims or caretakers) since moving into their new stadium in 2019, as though the elevated environment has created an expectation with which the squad-building cannot keep up. Forest, meanwhile, now on their fourth manager of the season, are a product of their owner, the combustible Evangelos Marinakis.But there is a more general trend. The role of the manager has undergone a curious evolution. When league football first began at the end of the 19th century, the team would usually be selected by the board of directors, possibly in conjunction with the captain. The secretary-manager, as he used to be styled, was an administrator, somebody who booked the trains and hotels and sorted out the contracts. Only in very rare cases, such as Tom Watson, who won three league titles at Sunderland and two at Liverpool, would he actually run the team. As Barney Ronay argues in his book The Manager, although figures such as Herbert Chapman at Huddersfield and Arsenal took an interest in tactics and team-building, one of the main attractions of the manager for a club’s directors was that he could be used as a scapegoat. When results were going awry, it was useful to have a beleaguered figure on the touchline to absorb criticism.After the second world war, though, managers became much bigger personalities. The likes of Matt Busby, Bill Shankly, Don Revie and Brian Clough ran their clubs in their own image; they became the most important person at their club. That characterisation continues to an extent with the likes of Guardiola and Mikel Arteta, but the key figure at the modern club is once again the owner. It may seem paradoxical when football has become so stratified that managers are changed so often – how much difference can he really make? – but he is once again expendable.And this is an age in which leaders do not, generally, tend to last long. The UK has had five prime ministers in seven years. In Australia, the Liberals have had five leaders in eight years. Turnover among chief executives in the world’s largest listed companies reached new highs in 2025, after a record in 2024, 21% above an eight-year average. In part,as an article in the Financial Times argued, that’s a result of global turmoil, from conflict in the Middle East and Europe to Donald Trump’s tumultuous style of government. But it’s also about impatience from activist shareholders, with a 40% increase in US CEOs toppled after their campaigns.Voters, shareholders and fans have never had less patience. That may in itself be a reaction to a rapidly changing world as new challenges demand new leaders. But it may also be that in a social media age in which every gripe is highlighted and complaints swell, in which algorithms promote discontent and performative fury is good business, long-termism is impossible. Maybe we’re all Marinakises now.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Their side may have lost 1-0 on the night, their dream FA Cup run coming to an end just when a lucrative trip to West Ham’s London Stadium in the fifth round had veered into sight, but pride was the overriding emotion.Ultimately it had taken an unfortunate own goal from Sam Heathcote, a PE teacher when not playing as a part-timer in the National League North, to nudgeBrentfordof the Premier League into the fifth round.‘It fills my heart’: Andrews lauds Macclesfield for their dream FA Cup adventureRead moreFor 70 minutes Macclesfield had proven a match for their illustrious visitors and they ended their cup campaign with a 2-2 aggregate scoreline against top-flight teams after thehistoric win over Crystal Palacein the third round. No wonder fans were shouting support and patting players’ backs after the final whistle.The fact Macclesfield pushed for a late equaliser after the 70th-minute goal via Heathcote’s head spoke volumes for the resilience shown by John Rooney’s side. There will be no dream trip to play in the former Olympic Stadium, but the team from a small town in Cheshire have won some London-based admirers in the past month or so.After a battling start by the Silkmen, riding on the high of that Palace win – despite Rooney’s insistence that his squad had remained grounded after shocking the Cup holders – Brentford eventually came to terms with the hosts, perhaps learning lessons where Oliver Glasner’s side did not.View image in fullscreenMacclesfield’s Sam Heathcote is consoled by Max Dearnley after the fourth-round match.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAThe first true opening for the Premier League club came on 13 minutes when a fizzing Reiss Nelson free-kick from the left sparked a goalmouth scramble. But it was still Macclesfield, through Luke Duffy and then Paul Dawson, their captain, who created the more dangerous first-half chances, drilling goalwards after a couple of careless Brentford mistakes in possession.Andrews demanded an improvement after the break and Brentford duly began to turn the screw, sustaining pressure and refusing to panic despite the scoreline remaining goalless. The visitors started to suss out the puzzle posed by the sixth-tier side, with the youngster Romelle Donovan beginning to relish his role down the right and Vitaly Janelt and Mathias Jensen weaving a web through the middle.The introduction of Keane Lewis-Potter gave the visitors some extra thrust on the flanks, with Macclesfield sitting ever deeper to protect the 0-0 scoreline. Eventually the pressure told as Lewis-Potter made an impact, darting down the left before his cross was diverted by Heathcote past Max Dearnley in the home goal.The celebrations were almost apologetic from the Brentford players, but there was no doubt their second-half play had merited the goal. Heathcote, who had been a hero in the defeat of Palace, sunk his head to the ground. Rooney said the defender was very down in the changing room afterwards.It was extra cruel for Macclesfield given they had only 10 players on the pitch at the time of the goal: Lewis Fensome was off the field with a hamstring injury but Rooney could not get a substitute on in time.Still, Rooney, like the majority of those in Moss Rose, was left with nothing but pride after it all. “To go and replicate the Crystal Palace performance – I know we didn’t get the result – but it was outstanding,” he said. “For a club of our level to go toe-to-toe with two Premier League sides is incredible. We lost today by an own goal when we had 10 men on the pitch – that’s football. It can be cruel at times, but I could not be any prouder of the lads tonight. To go on this journey and do it all together, I’m so proud.”Rooney could be especially proud of the way Macclesfield finished the game, carving out late opportunities to give the Premier League side one final scare. They launched one final assault and D’Mani Mellor, their young forward, found himself in striking distance of goal three times in the space of a minute but was thwarted on each occasion, lastly by the Bees’ keeper Hákon Valdimarsson. It was hardly a case of Brentford marching on to the fifth round; more sneaking through and a crisis averted for Andrews and his men.Explore more on these topicsFA CupMacclesfieldBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Tammy Abraham should have been ruled offside for Villa’s opening goal, a high tackle by Lucas Digne on Newcastle’s Jacob Murphy was not adjudged to be reckless, and Digne clearly handled inside the Villa penalty area, only for Kavanagh to award a free-kick outside the box instead of a penalty.Kavanagh’s showing has prompted a new round of debate regarding the value of video assistant refereeing. TheFA Cupuses video refereeing technology only from the fifth round and the Newcastle manager, Eddie Howe, suggested after the Villa tie that match officials had begun to avoid taking difficult decisions because they are accustomed to VAR being there to correct any errors.Asked whether referees were hiding behind VAR, Howe said: “There’s an argument to say that, because when VAR is there, there’s always a: ‘Well, I won’t give that, but let’s check it.’ I think then your decision-making maybe isn’t as sharp as it may normally have to be.”Howe said he was torn over the use of VAR because of the impact that delayed decisions can have on spontaneity. “That joy that you get in that moment, I still really love, and VAR takes it away,” he said. “But then on the other side, I was wishing there was VAR on the first goal against us, and probably throughout that game.”Explore more on these topicsRefereesFA CupAston VillaNewcastle UnitedVideo assistant referees (VARs)newsShareReuse this content"

But they still managed to upset Atlético MadridSid LoweMon 16 Feb 2026 15.51 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 18.01 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleOne day in November, the coach of Rayo Vallecano decided that was it: he was out. The captain in whom he finds strength hadreached a similar conclusionlong ago, handing in his armband as an act of protest and dignity. Two Fridays ago, the squad signed a statement saying theycouldn’t carry onlike this. And last Friday, the fans who’ve been through it all before decided they too would walk away. Yet 48 hours later, after another week that proved them right, resisting everything, there they were still, celebrating another implausible success, another day when they had stuck it to The Man. If not, admittedly, the man they’d like to stick it to.Actually, ‘there’? Not all of them were in the same place, even if that was a way of showing they were in this together. Because Rayo fans were out on the streets of the self-styledindependent republic of Vallecaswith their banners and scarves and songs on Sunday, while their team and coach were 10km south, playing in a different city. With their training ground unusable and their home home ground declared to be so too, they had to prepare at Getafe’s place and play at Leganés’s stadium. Where, in front of 9,000 empty seats, and kicking off in the relegation zone, they only went and beat Atlético Madrid 3-0, three days after Diego’s Simeone’s side hadbattered Barcelona 4-0.Football doesn’t always make sense, which is what makes it brilliant, and a lot of the time Rayo Vallecano make even less, which is what makes them what they are. Still the smallest side inprimera, they play in a ground built into thebarriothat has only three sides, the fourth a wall where a Fede Valverde shot literally flew over and into a living room in the tower block behind. But that isn’t the problem: they’re proud of who they are and the home they have, proud of the team they support and the side’s almost absurd ability to overcome the odds, this season resisting Madridand Barcelonain Vallecas and heading into Europe25 years later. The problem that is the odds are stacked so heavily against them, and from within.Quick GuideGirona stun BarcelonaShowBarcelona blow chance to retake top spotGirona came from behind to beat visitors Barcelona 2-1 in La Liga on Monday, as last season’s champions failed to return to the summit, leaving Real Madrid top of the table.Barcelona struck the woodwork twice in the first half, Raphinha hitting the post before Lamine Yamal fired a penalty against the same upright in added time after Dani Olmo was fouled inside the box.Pau Cubarsi finally put the visitors ahead in the 59th minute, rising to head home Jules Koundé’s cross from a short corner but Girona levelled three minutes later when Thomas Lemar converted from close range after Vladyslav Vanat’s cross caused confusion.Fran Beltran (pictured) sealed victory in the 87th minute, steering home from Joel Roca’s pass as the Montilivi stadium erupted.Barcelona pushed for an equaliser but could not break through, even after Roca was sent off in added time. Barça remain on 58 points, two behind Real Madrid, and have lost successive games in all competitions for the first time since October.ReutersPhotograph: Siu Wu/EFEWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.These days supporters ask only one thing of the president and owner, Raúl Martín Presa, repeatedly, vociferously and to his face: that he leave. Hecalled them “drunk, brainless and idle”, the provocation constant, and the situation so unpleasant it is hard to believe he keeps going. Not least because the deterioration of the club. Óscar Trejo – the man who realised the best thing he could do as captain was to stop being captain – described it as a place where there was“problem after problem”. The list is endless and documented at a club that lives in isolation from the rest of the league and is somehow allowed to, a law unto itself, embarrassing for everyone.The stadium and training ground are municipally owned and Presa is pushing the Madrid government for a move to a new ground, something the coach says would be “devastating”. Rayo backed La Liga’sCVC dealto bring investment to clubs, who would be forced to use at least 70% for development or infrastructure, but have not taken the money. Staff have long paid for equipment out of their own pockets and when players returned for pre-season, they couldn’t work at the training ground, where there was a fungal infection on the grass. The players have said there has been a lack of hot water in the showers on some days.View image in fullscreenRayo’s Nobel Mendy rises for a header against Atlético.Photograph: Pierre-Philippe Marcou/AFP/Getty ImagesThe stadium is even worse, rubbish and rubble piling up, cables hanging out, chunks of cement breaking off; toilets are filthy, even for a football stadium. You can romanticise humility, embrace earthiness – and they do – but this is something more basic, something beyond that: simple hygiene. The facilities are almost laughably poor, Lech Poznan’s surprised kit man publishing a video: no light, boxes stacked up, a couple of plastic chairs, a few coat hangers and the old multicoloured towels stacked up in the dressing room looking like a scene from your granny’s airing cupboard. The playing surface wasn’t good either, and don’t think that suited them, the classic sneaky trick of the small team: under thecoach Íñigo Pérez, Rayo would rather play and, he lamented, they couldn’t on this. The full-back Pep Chavarría called the pitch “a disgrace”. “Not even good enough for the regional football,” according to his teammate Álvaro García. Patches had been put down, but it didn’t work. Then last week, 10 days after facing Osasuna, they started to relay the whole thing, four days before facing Oviedo and in the middle of the wettest month anyone could remember. They hadn’t finished 24 hours before kick-off. What could possibly go wrong?On the Friday morning, Rayo’s players turned up for training in the stadium, took one look and left. Patience worn down, that afternoon they put out a statement with the players’ union outlining the issues they faced and calling for “worthy working conditions”. But it wasn’t until a little after 10am the following morning, less than four hours before kick-off, thatLa Ligaunilaterally announced the postponement, mumbling something vague about climatic conditions and Rayo having tried their best, when they really hadn’t tried at all. That weekend only one game in the Madrid region was postponed “because” of the weather, at any level and any age group: this one. Oviedo supported the Rayo players’ demands, they said, but this wasn’t an accident; it was negligence.Rayo’s own fans agreed – they had seen it all before – and that position seemed reinforced whena week later, La Liga decided that, never mind Oviedo on 7 February, the pitch wasn’t read to face Atlético on 15 February. This time Rayo’s players and coach thought it could be ready but, with the team having to prepare at Getafe’s HQ because the training ground was no better, they were forced take on Atlético at second division Leganés, five tables set up outside at Rayo’s training ground so that season-ticket holders could queue for a ticket. With supporters’ groups calling for a boycott, not even a third came. A Mariachi band did, standing at the gates and singing Paquita la del Barrio’s “Rat on two legs”, dedicated to Presa. “Scum of the earth,” it runs, “how much damage you have done. Cockroach, bloodsucker, hyena, snake … the lowest beasts are nothing compared to you.”Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowElche 0-0 Osasuna; Real Madrid 4-1 Real Sociedad; Sevilla 1-1 Alavés; Getafe 2-1 Villarreal; Espanyol 2-2 Celta Vigo; Mallorca 1-2 Real Betis; Levante 0-2 Valencia; Rayo Vallecano 3-0 Atlético Madrid; Oviedo 1-2 Athletic ClubWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.So it was that on Sunday, as kick-off came, thousands of Rayo fans stayed at home and 2,000 marched through Vallecas. At Butarque meanwhile 5,335 people turned up to watch Rayo and Atlético. In truth, that was more than they hoped but most did so torn and apologetically: their struggling team needed them, they reasoned. It was still only a quarter of the members and it led to the lowest attendance since the pandemic, the sad, damaging sight of empty seats, something soulless about it all. “People say: ‘This is the drop that sees the glass overflow,’” Pérez said, the Spanish equivalent of straw on a camel’s back. “But the glass is broken, and that’s the danger.”Drop by drop, the surprise was not that Rayo went into Sunday’s game in exile and the bottom three, facing relegation for the first time in five years; it was that it hadn’t happened much, much earlier. And that, by the end of it, they were out again. ThatRayo Vallecano, the team that don’t make sense, the club that is completely, marvellously out of place in Europe, did it again. The week that Lech Poznan came, Pérez admits he was “emotionally out, and it had nothing to do with football”. But that night, 2-0 down after 40 minutes, they came back to secure a 3-2 win that healed and he is still there. Against Barcelona, they wouldn’t be beaten. Against Madrid, they wouldn’t be either. And, in a third “home” game against the big three, nor would they be against Atlético.View image in fullscreenRayo Vallecano defender Alfonso Espino fights for the ball with Nahuel Molina.Photograph: Pierre-Philippe Marcou/AFP/Getty Images“I hope this helps us avoid relegation,” Andrei Ratiu said. “We would have liked our fans close and understand those that didn’t come. We put out a statement, and hope to be heard. We needed this win.” They had deserved it too: goals from Fran Pérez, Óscar Valentín and Nobel Mendy had the Final Countdown booming round Butarque, Atlético broken. At full-time they bundled back into the dressing room, leaping about second division facilities better than theirs. “We’re happy after the week we’ve had,” said the captain, Valentín, a tinge of sadness sinking in as he offered an eternal truth for his team: “It hasn’t been easy to focus on the game.”Nor was it about the game, but something bigger, the coach insisted. “This is one of the best wins in a sporting sense, but it’s not a special day,” Pérez said. “It’s a bitter day for Rayo’s people, I can’t say differently. I won’t fall into the hypocrisy of saying: ‘We’ve won, it’s a happy day.’ Today is a day to be with those having a bad time, a day to think, to help, to empathise, a day to feel sad.”PosTeamPGDPts1Real Madrid2434602Barcelona2340583Villarreal2318454Atletico Madrid2417455Real Betis2410416Espanyol24-4357Celta Vigo245348Real Sociedad24-1319Athletic Bilbao24-73110Osasuna2403011Getafe24-82912Sevilla24-82613Alaves24-92614Valencia24-122615Girona23-152616Elche24-42517Rayo Vallecano23-92518Mallorca24-102419Levante23-141820Oviedo23-2316Explore more on these topicsLa LigaEuropean club footballRayo VallecanoAtlético MadridfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Time will tell but it feels as if this could be a pivotal weekend for VfB, a feeling given credence by what happened next. Saturday’s win took Hoeness and company into the top four; the two points surprisingly dropped by Leipzig at home to Wolfsburg on Sunday allowed them to stay there. This is what being one of the big boys is all about.As is prying points from unpromising situations. Aiming to recover from last week’s shock loss at relegation-threatened St Pauli, this was hard going for Stuttgart. Ermedin Demirovic had given them a first-half lead but it was hardly decisive and, when Kwasniok took an uncharacteristic gamble by making some ultra-attacking substitutions, the momentum changed.Ragnar Ache’s superbly taken equaliser for Köln came with 11 minutes of normal time to go, but the home side kept their cool. Demirovic’s second, smoothly steered in from Ramon Hendricks’ cross, put them back in front just under five minutes later, before Deniz Undav wrapped it up in stoppage time. Demirovic and Undav faced the media together afterwards, with the latter praising the Bosnian No 9 as having “saved my arse” with his finishes.Undav spurned a one-on-one chance in the first half, his nonchalant chip too close to the Köln keeper, Marvin Schwäbe. The forwards are part of a four-pronged attacking armada at Hoeness’s disposal, with the coveted Jamie Leweling on one side and Chris Führich on the other. They can find the combinations to open most safes. After Undav had fluffed his lines, Demirovic got Stuttgart going by concluding a direct move which was atypical of a possession-hungry side, smashing home after Leweling headed a long crossfield pass into his path.View image in fullscreenDenis Undav, Jamie Leweling and Ermedin Demirovic form three-quarters of Stuttgart’s attacking quartet.Photograph: Action Press/ShutterstockThis was all after a week in which Stuttgart’s understated excellence came a little more into wider focus. The name of Hoeness was on other fans’ lips again, put forward after Thomas Frank’s sacking as a potential candidate for Tottenham in the summer. Undav, enjoying perhaps a best-ever season with almost a goal per Bundesliga start and a barrel of accompanying assists, has his future on the block. Stuttgart want to extend his contract which has just a season left after this one. The club are inclined to add just two seasons to it, though, rather than the three Undav wants, as he turns 30 this summer.What happens next will either add towards the club’s story of recent seasons, platforming stars such as Serhou Guirassy, Waldemar Anton, Nick Woltemade and more, who emerge and then go elsewhere, or will take them to the next level. Big decisions await, and Stuttgart need to decide what they really want to be. What is certain is that they can no longer hide their light under a bushel.Quick GuideBundesliga resultsShowBorussia Dortmund 4-0 Mainz, Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 St. Pauli, Eintracht Frankfurt 3-0 Borussia M’gladbach, Hoffenheim 3-0 Freiburg, Werder Bremen 0-3 Bayern Munich, Hamburg 3-2 Union Berlin, Stuttgart 3-1 Cologne, Augsburg 1-0 Heidenheim,  RB Leipzig 2-2 WolfsburgWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Talking pointsOn the other side of Saturday’s fence all is far from rosy in Köln, despite it being Karneval season. The teenage star Saïd El Mala again started from the bench, provoking significant fan anger towards Kwasniok, who was already walking on eggshells. As well as makingEffzeha touch one-dimensional, the marginalisation of El Mala is hurting his chances of being a World Cup wildcard for Germany. Brighton are especially keen on making a summer move for the 19-year-old winger.Harry Kane was always likely to reach the dual mark of 25 league goals for the season and 500 for his career at freefalling Werder Bremen. He scored a penalty to reach the first target, then achieved the second with an exquisite finish from outside the area. This was such a foregone conclusion for Bayern Munich that conversation quickly turned to where the England captain’s numbers might end up this season. Kane is 15 goals away from matching Robert Lewandowski’s single-season Bundesliga tally. “I don’t care about the record, and I will tell Harry that to has face,” grinned Vincent Kompany, underlining Kane’s commitment to team goals.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane enjoys another goalscoring milestone.Photograph: Fabian Bimmer/ReutersPlaying and winning on Friday night against Mainz, Dortmund did exactly what they did last week, temporarily closing the gap on Bayern to three points overnight. Despite Mainz being in the thick of the relegation battle this was a very satisfying victory for BVB, not so much because of thelingering ghost of the 2022-23 season’s final day, but because they swept aside in-form opponents, Arsenal-ing them with four goals from set pieces. All were delivered by Julian Ryerson, with the Norwegian now up to 11 assists in the Bundesliga this season – only Michael Olise has more. Before this week’s Champions League playoff first leg against Atalanta, the other good news for Niko Kovac is that Guirassy has rediscovered his goalscoring touch. His double agains Mainz took him to five goals in his last three games – as many as he managed in his previous 25.Leverkusen got back on the horse after last week’s disappointing display at Mönchengladbach, sweeping aside St Pauli 4-0 to keep the pressure on the top four; they trail Stuttgart by three points with a game in hand. The successful return of Ibrahim Maza, outstanding for much of the first half of the campaign, was key.

The wingbacks Nathaniel Brown and Ayoube Amaimouni both starred and scored, though the real headline was keeping only a second clean sheet since early November. Riera has already made a huge impact but it is clear that he is reorganising on the fly, and used the post-goal celebrations to pass on instructions. “This is the best time to reach my players,” he emphasised. “I want to control every detail.”PosTeamPGDPts1Bayern Munich2263572Borussia Dortmund2227513Hoffenheim2219454Stuttgart2212425RB Leipzig2212406Bayer Leverkusen2116397Eintracht Frankfurt22-2318Freiburg22-4309Hamburg21-72510Union Berlin22-92511Augsburg22-142512Cologne22-62313Borussia M'gladbach22-122214Mainz22-122115Wolfsburg22-152016Werder Bremen22-201917St Pauli22-191718Heidenheim22-2913Explore more on these topicsBundesligaEuropean club footballStuttgartfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Andrée Jeglertz’s side were back to their free-flowing attacking best, putting six past Leicester. Dominant seems to be a bit of an understatement when describing this performance. The league leaders created 31 chances, with 15 on target; had an expected goals of 4.63; registered 66 touches in the opposition box; and made 600 of 660 passes (91%). The front four of Lauren Hemp, Bunny Shaw, Kerolin and Vivianne Miedema is formidable and they were involved, to some degree, in five of the six goals. Hemp starred down the left, creating 11 chances that include two assists; Shaw sent home a trademark header for her 15th league goal of the season; Miedema pulled the strings and grabbed herself a double; and Kerolin scored the pick of the bunch and registered an assist.Sophie Downey2James proves to be Chelsea’s headline actLauren James was the headline act in Chelsea’s win 2-0 over Liverpool with a trademark finish and an assist for Sjoeke Nüsken’s opener. In a game defined by which team were able to take their opportunities, James’s ability to be the gamechanger shone through, first as a more central forward, then on the wing. It was also a reminder of the fact Sonia Bompastor has been unable to call upon her quality for long periods owing to an ankle injury sustained at last summer’s European Championship. This was her sixth league start and first 90 minutes. “When she is performing at this level, she is one of the first that you put in your starting XI,” Bompastor said. “[It’s] important going into the business end of the season to have a player of this quality who is performing at that level. The most important thing is to keep her as fit as possible … It’s important for her to build on this fitness.”SDMatch report: Chelsea 2-0 Liverpool3Phelan’s appointment sparks Everton revivalEverton’s 1-0 win over West Ham continued an unexpected surge under their interim head coach, Scott Phelan. After Evertonparted ways with Brian Sørensentwo weeks ago, the club turned to their under-18s coach, a move that has paid dividends. An early Honoka Hayashi goal secured a third straight WSL victory and back-to-back home wins (the first came under Sørensen), making Phelan the first Everton manager to win their opening two WSL matches. He described it as “the perfect day” and said: “At one point, we probably thought this would be bricks and rubble, so the fact that we’ve continued the legacy at Goodison Park and we have that honour of playing and winning games here is something we need to make the most of.” With a Merseyside derby in the FA Cup next, Everton suddenly carry momentum rather than pressure.Réshma RaoView image in fullscreenHonoka Hayashi (left) scored Everton’s winner against West Ham at Goodison Park.Photograph: Jess Hornby/WSL/WSL Football/Getty Images4Pressure rises on Arroyo as Villa concede sevenThe pressure on Natalia Arroyo significantly increased after her struggling Aston Villa side conceded seven at home against Tottenham. Villa’s defensive fragilities were laid bare again, with four Spurs goals scored in 16 second-half minutes. It took Villa’s goals conceded for the season up to 36 – the worst in the league – and left them ninth. Arroyo suggested that although she had received support from the board, her job could be at risk. The manager said: “It’s not me deciding that. I will be judged by results and my results aren’t talking nicely about my work.” Arroyo continued: “It was like being thrown in a swimming pool and not allowed to get air – it was cruel. I am really sorry and disappointed.”Emillia Hawkins5United extend winning run despite busy scheduleSometimes you have to win, even if it’s not pretty. That’s what Manchester United did in a gritty 2-1 victory against London City Lionesses. It comes in the midst of a packed fixture list, with the club juggling midweek Champions League games as a new challenge. With that comes increased risk of fatigue, injury and illness. But Marc Skinner said he believed his team “always find a way” and that the result was “one of the biggest wins of the season”. The head coach said: “It’s not easy to come off the pitch that we played on midweek [against Atlético Madrid], get back at 4 am and produce a winning performance today.” It means United extended their winning run to seven in all competitions, and are seven games unbeaten in the WSL.Renuka Odedra6Fans deserve better after postponementBrighton v Arsenal was postponed two hours before kick-off because of a waterlogged pitch at Broadfield Stadium, despite it having protective covers on. For weeks there have been flood warnings issued by the Met Office, so might it have been sensible to have switched this one in advance to the Amex Stadium, given there were no conflicts with the men’s team schedule? Brighton’s owner, Tony Bloom, said last year when talking about a new ground for the women’s team that the Amex was “too big of a stadium” and that “having four, five or six thousand in a 36,000-seater stadium isn’t great for atmosphere”. But for fans who navigate a congested fixture list, this game deserved foresight it didn’t receive.ROPosTeamPGDPts1Man City Women1634422Man Utd Women1619343Chelsea Women1616334Arsenal Women1416295Tottenham Hotspur Women162296London City Lionesses16-9197Brighton & Hove Albion Women15-1178Everton Women16-8179Aston Villa Women16-141610West Ham Women16-201111Liverpool FC Women16-121012Leicester Women15-239Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester City WomenChelsea WomenLauren JamesEverton WomenAston Villa WomenBrighton & Hove Albion WomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Until that point, Macclesfield’s dogged defending and determination had made it a difficult night for Brentford, the Silkmen threatening to pull off a second successive cup upset after stunning the holders, Crystal Palace,in the third round.“A tricky game for us,” said Andrews. “We have a lot of respect for the way they play, the spirit they have, the way they can change and perform to the levels they have against us and Palace, it’s a testament to John and the club.“It was never going to be easy, I thought we didn’t make it easy for ourselves in the first half but we controlled large parts of the second half and eventually got the goal. I thought they were immense tonight, absolutely immense to the end. They gave us a proper cup tie that most people would have enjoyed – I can’t say I did!”Andrews then lauded Macclesfield for the progress they have achieved in recent years, reforming as a phoenix club in 2020 and rising back up the leagues after the previous iteration, Macclesfield Town,went into liquidationamid financial difficulties.“I love the English football pyramid,” he said. “I’ve played and coached in a lot of it and I love what it stands for and there’s always journeys that clubs are on. I like stories like that, it actually fills my heart.”Rooney appreciated Andrews’ gesture. “The thing he’d seen was the togetherness we had,” said the Macclesfield manager. “That’s something we work on all the time. We’re a close-knit group. To have a good changing room like that in football I believe takes you a long way.“Something we spoke about this season was to make the playoffs and have a goodFA Cuprun. Did I think we could get to the fourth round? I certainly didn’t. But for what the lads have achieved and all the people behind the scenes in the office – it’s a real community club – is something we’re proud of.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupMacclesfieldBrentfordnewsShareReuse this content"

The mandated limit is 30, but players were given dispensation for the Lions tour on the proviso they were allowed five weeks off on returning from Australia and missed the first two rounds of the 2025-26 season.Keith Wood: ‘After a Lions series, every player that went on tour is wrecked’Read moreThe 24-year-old, who started all three Tests against the Wallabies, was one of 15 England players to take part in the Lions tour. Ireland, England’s opponents at Twickenham on Saturday, contributed 18 to a squad overseen by their head coach, Andy Farrell.Freeman returned to action for Northampton in round three of the Prem in October, but explained that his Saints coaches Phil Dowson and Sam Vesty intervened, sensing something was not right, and adjusted his workload. He started England’s autumn victoriesagainst AustraliaandFiji, only for a hamstring injury to strike, making his comeback just before Christmas and appearing in every match for which he has been available since then.“I struggled without realising it,” Freeman said. “I had the five weeks off, the body felt good, but my mental state wasn’t in the best spot. Saints did really well at noticing that and giving me the time. England as well, picking that up and getting me back into the games in the right way. They’ve done very well since then.Quick GuideIRFU investigate racist abuse of EdogboShowThe Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) is investigating \"cowardly\" racist abuse directed at Edwin Edogbo following his international debut.Munster second-row Edogbo was targeted on social media after coming on as a replacement in Saturday's 20-13 Six Nations victory over Italy in Dublin. The 23-year-old was born and raised in Cobh, County Cork to Nigerian parents.Posts on the IRFU's X and Instagram accounts celebrating Edogbo's first cap attracted a number of racist comments.In a statement released to Press Association Sport, an IRFU spokesperson said: \"We're aware of some targeted abuse online in recent days and continue to work with Signify [a data technology company which specialises in protecting against online abuse] and the relevant authorities to report it.\"We will also continue to fully support all affected by the cowardly actions of a minority and investigations are underway alongside our partners Signify.\"It is clear that racist abuse has no place in Irish society and the IRFU has a zero tolerance policy towards racism of any form.\"Edogbo played the final 10 minutes against Italy after coming on for James Ryan. He received a huge cheer from the Aviva Stadium crowd before helping Andy Farrell's side hold on for victory during a nail-biting finale.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“You go on a big Lions tour and I think it was off the back of 34 games or so. It’s a lot of rugby and then I could probably have managed my off time better. Without realising it, I think I was tired. My body felt like I was OK to go and I was saying to coaches: ‘Yeah I’m fine, I’m fine.’ I just think mentally it was a bit more of a struggle.“I can’t really explain the feeling, if I’m honest, it was just a mix of up and downs, really. [The coaches] pulled me from bits here and there: some gym sessions and running, bits and bobs of training and then a few games, which was really good.View image in fullscreenTommy Freeman started all three Lions Tests against Australia.Photograph: Dan Sheridan/Inpho/Shutterstock“On the Lions tour, if you weren’t involved you were with the non-23 quite a lot and doing stuff outside. I just locked myself in and it might have been a bit of buildup of anxiety. When you go on tours and go away for a long time I normally get ill, just the stress relief being off you. It is a mixture of all that.”Freeman is likely to keep his place, either at centre or on the wing, as England seek to bounce back against Ireland at Twickenhamafter their defeat by Scotland. Steve Borthwick, the head coach, is understood to be waiting on the outcome of Henry Arundell’s disciplinary hearing on Tuesday morning before finalising his team.Tom Curry, who came on for Sam Underhill at half-time at Murrayfield, is pushing for a start to add more physicality to England’s ranks. Borthwick will also ponder whether to include Marcus Smith or George Furbank in the squad for extra creativity.“We have to front up better physically, especially the first 20-25 minutes,” Curry said. “There are a couple of things that probably didn’t go our way with regards to the bounce of the ball and that sort of stuff, but still we had multiple opportunities to put our best foot forward and we probably didn’t.“Steve is great at reframing and attacking what we have to go after.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamIreland rugby union teamSix Nations 2026Six NationsBritish & Irish LionsLions tour 2025Rugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

If Zimbabwe beat Ireland on Tuesday (20.30 AEDT) Australia are out of the World Cup. Even should Zimbabwe lose Australia need them to also lose against Sri Lanka on Wednesday (20.30 AEDT).If Zimbabwe do lose both matches Australia then need to beat Oman on Friday (Saturday 0030 AEDT), and do so convincingly enough to finish above the African side on net run rate.Australia’s batting was an innings of two parts. For the first 50 balls Australia were dominant as Marsh and Head put on 104. Sri Lanka’s woes deepened when seamer Matheesha Pathirana suffered a calf injury four balls into his opening over and was unable to continue.Marsh, playing his first match of the tournament after suffering a testicular injury, highlighted the top order verve Australia have been missing with eight fours and a six.View image in fullscreenSri Lanka's Pathum Nissanka takes a catch to dismiss Australia's Glenn Maxwell.Photograph: Ishara S Kodikara/AFP/Getty ImagesHead had made 50 runs combined in his past four innings, but he reached that landmark in 27 balls with a brutal display of hitting, posting seven fours and three sixes.With the pair rampant Australia, who had been put in to bat, were 0-70 at the end of the six-over power play with Marsh hitting the final five balls, bowled by the dangerous Maheesh Theekshana, to the boundary.But in mid-innings the spinners changed the game. After Head was caught on the boundary for a 29-ball 56 wickets tumbled and the rate slowed.From 0-104 Australia slumped to 4-130 with Marsh among them, lbw on review for a 27-ball 54.Head’s exit had brought in Green but he was quickly stumped. With scores of 21, 0 and 3 in the competition he was a contentious selection given the arrival of Steve Smith and the good form of Matt Renshaw. The Queensland batter made way for Marsh despite being top scorer with 65 in the shock loss to Zimbabwe that had put Australia under pressure to win this match.Tim David (six) was also caught in the deep and it could have been worse. Josh Inglis, who was the third best score with 27, should have been stumped first ball.His eventual departure, after Glenn Maxwell (22) had been superbly caught by Nissanka reverse sweeping, prompted another clatter of wickets, the last five going down for seven runs in 12 balls.It still looked a testing target and Australia made an early inroad when Stoinis had Perera caught at deep point. But Nissanka and Kusal Mendis then added 97 off 66 balls to keep the match in the balance.It took the return of Stoinis to break the partnership, Mendis being caught by Connolly at deep mid-wicket for a 38-ball 51.But that was as good as it got for Stoinis. The new batter, Pavan Rathnayake, carted his first two balls for four and 20 were taken of Stoinis’ next over, the 15th.That brought the target down to 41 off five overs. Sri Lanka only needed three taking 10, 18 and 15 off them with Nissanka completing a majestic century off what proved the penultimate delivery.Explore more on these topicsT20 World Cup 2026Australia cricket teamSri Lanka cricket teamAustralia sportCricketT20 World CupTwenty20newsShareReuse this content"

Even then, safety labels only appear below all of the extra medical advice assembled using generative AI, and in a smaller, lighter font.“This is for informational purposes only,” the disclaimer tells users who click through for further details after seeing the initial summary, and navigate their way to the very end of the AI Overview. “For medical advice or a diagnosis, consult a professional. AI responses may include mistakes.”Google did not deny its disclaimers fail to appear when users are first served medical advice, or that they appear below AI Overviews and in a smaller, lighter font. AI Overviews “encourage people to seek professional medical advice”, and frequently mention seeking medical attention within the summary itself “when appropriate”, a spokesperson said.AI experts and patient advocates presented with the Guardian’s findings said they were concerned. Disclaimers serve a vital purpose, they said, and should appear prominently when users are first provided with medical advice.“The absence of disclaimers when users are initially served medical information creates several critical dangers,” said Pat Pataranutaporn, an assistant professor, technologist and researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a world-renowned expert in AI and human-computer interaction.“First, even the most advanced AI models today still hallucinate misinformation or exhibit sycophantic behaviour, prioritising user satisfaction over accuracy. In healthcare contexts, this can be genuinely dangerous.“Second, the issue isn’t just about AI limitations – it’s about the human side of the equation. Users may not provide all necessary context or may ask the wrong questions by misobserving their symptoms.“Disclaimers serve as a crucial intervention point. They disrupt this automatic trust and prompt users to engage more critically with the information they receive.”Gina Neff, a professor of responsible AI at Queen Mary University of London, said the “problem with bad AI Overviews is by design” and Google was to blame. “AI Overviews are designed for speed, not accuracy, and that leads to mistakes in health information, which can be dangerous.”In January,a Guardian investigationrevealed people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews.Neff saidthe investigation’s findingsshowed why prominent disclaimers were essential. “Google makes people click through before they find any disclaimer,” she said. “People reading quickly may think the information they get from AI Overviews is better than what it is, but we know it can make serious mistakes.”Following the Guardian’s reporting, Googleremoved AI Overviewsfor some but not all medical searches.Sonali Sharma, a researcher at Stanford University’s centre for AI in medicine and imaging (AIMI), said: “The major issue is that these Google AI Overviews appear at the very top of the search page and often provide what feels like a complete answer to a user’s question at a time where they are trying to access information and get an answer as quickly as possible.“For many people, because that single summary is there immediately, it basicallycreates a sense of reassurancethat discourages further searching, or scrolling through the full summary and clicking ‘Show more’ where a disclaimer might appear.“What I think can lead to real-world harm is the fact that the AI Overviews can often contain partially correct and partially incorrect information, and it becomes very difficult to tell what is accurate or not, unless you are familiar with the subject matter already.”A Google spokesperson said: “It’s inaccurate to suggest that AI Overviews don’t encourage people to seek professional medical advice. In addition to a clear disclaimer, AI Overviews frequently mention seeking medical attention directly within the overview itself, when appropriate.”Tom Bishop, head of patient information at Anthony Nolan, a blood cancer charity, called for urgent action. “We know misinformation is a real problem, but when it comes to health misinformation, it’s potentially really dangerous,” said Bishop.“That disclaimer needs to be much more prominent, just to make people step back and think … ‘Is this something I need to check with my medical team rather than acting upon it? Can I take this at face value or do I really need to look into it in more detail and see how this information relates to my own specific medical situation?’ Because that’s the key here.”He added: “I’d like this disclaimer to be right at the top. I’d like it to be the first thing you see. And ideally it would be the same size font as everything else you’re seeing there, not something that’s small and easy to miss.”Explore more on these topicsGoogleAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingAlphabetHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

That weekend, the boy had been at A&E after an attempt at self-harm, and in his notes the hospital doctor had recommended the teenager be prescribed antidepressants. “I thought: ‘Wait a minute, I can’t just start a 16-year-old on antidepressants,’” says Chatterjee. He wanted to understand what was going on in the boy’s life.They talked for a while, and Chatterjee asked him about his screen use, which turned out to be high. “I said: ‘I think your screen use, particularly in the evenings, might be impacting your mental wellbeing.’” Chatterjee helped the boy and his mother set up a routine where digital devices and social media went off an hour before bed, gradually extending the screen-free period over six weeks. After two months, he says the boy stopped needing to see him. A few months after that, his mother wrote Chatterjee a note to say her son had been transformed – he was engaging with his friends and trying new activities. He was, she said, like a different boy from the one who had ended up in hospital.Chatterjee believes that “the widespread adoption of screens into our children’s lives is the most urgent public health issue of our time”. He was never very political, he says. He is the affable host of a successful health podcast,Feel Better, Live More, and his books strike an optimistic, inspiring tone – but on this issue he is passionate, his frustration obvious. “I think successive governments have been very weak here, and they are failing a whole generation of children. I think they’ve already failed a generation of children.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m not judging parents.’Photograph: Posed by model; Olga Dobrovolska/Getty ImagesChatterjee saw that young patient more than 10 years ago, and since then children’s screen use has soared. To clinicians, he says, the harm “has been obvious for over a decade”. This has led to a swell of action, fromAustralia’s social media ban for under-16sto Spain’s just-announced plans for one. In the UK, grassroots parents’ organisations such asSmartphone Free ChildhoodandSafeScreenswant the UK to follow suit. Chatterjee, who is involved with campaign organisationClose Screens Open Mindsover the proliferation of “ed tech” in schools, believes the legal age for using social media should be 18, as with gambling and access to pornography. “As a society, we have safeguards in place to protect children,” Chatterjee says. “At the moment, we are in the middle of a widespread experiment that no one consciously signed up to.”Tech bosses, he says, have had too much influence over deciding “what’s best for our children. If we’re expecting Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg to regulate technology better for our children’s wellbeing, we’re being, frankly, delusional. Their whole business model wants more people on their devices for longer.” Adults struggle with screen use, he points out. “Our children have got no chance. Their prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain where we exercise rational decision-making, is not fully developed till the age of 25.”Every additional hour of screen time increases the risk of myopia by 21% in childrenHe rattles off the harms, which include the effect on children’s mental health and anxiety. “We know it’s affecting their sleep.” It isaffecting posture, and causes neck and shoulder pain. For younger children, it causes language delay. “There’s research coming out now saying it’saffecting their eyesight. Every additional hour of screen time increases the risk of myopia by 21% and in children already diagnosed with myopia, an extra hour increases risk of progression by 54%. I think we’re raising a generation of children who have low self-worth, who don’t know how to conduct conversations. The content children have been exposed to is really alarming –10% of nine-year-olds have seen pornography, and 27% of 11-year-olds.” He adds that there is a strong chance that the first time someone goes on a pornographic website, they will be served images of violence: one French study found thatup to 90% of online pornfeatured verbal, physical and sexual violence against women.We’re speaking over video call, Chatterjee at his home studio where he makes his podcast. He barely stops for breath. He is warm and likable, and seems to have the supreme self-assurance that all successful podcasters develop. But he stresses that he doesn’t blame parents (or teachers, who are dealing with the encroachment of “ed tech”, the increased use of devices and software, in schools). Screen use is higher in children in lower socioeconomic groups. “People are living stressed-out lives. There are a lot of families who are struggling with the cost of living.” Screens are, he says, “an easy babysitter. And I say it with compassion, I get that.”View image in fullscreenScreen-based homework ‘should be abolished immediately’, says Chatterjee.Photograph: Posed by model; MoMo Productions/Getty ImagesChatterjee’s own children are 13 and 15. They have smartphones, but with almost all apps, including the internet browser, disabled. They are not allowed to access social media. “I’m not judging other parents, because I do understand the pressures. For me, because I’ve seen so many suicidal, depressed, anxious teenagers – and I could directly see a correlation between that and their screen and social media use – I thought I cannot allow my children on to these platforms.”He and his wife have always had open conversations with their children and he says: “So far, it’s been fine. But I think they may be the only two kids in their school not on social media. It’s very hard for most parents to do that.” Chatterjee has already complained to the headteacher about screen-based homework, which “should be abolished immediately”. Bright light from screens in the evening, he says, is wreaking havoc on teenagers’ sleep. He is always turning down the screen brightness on his kids’ laptops when they’re doing homework, and screens have to go off at least an hour before bed.Chatterjee stopped practising as a GP nearly two years ago. He misses it, he says, but he realised he could reach many more people with his broadcasting work than he could with 10-minute appointments at his surgery (he is also visiting professor of health education and communication at the University of Chester). His broadcasting career took off after he made the2015 BBC series Doctor in the House, and now his podcast has had more than 350m listens, with 1.3 million subscribers to his YouTube channel. He is a big advocate of lifestyle change, which gives Chatterjee something of a holistic air.View image in fullscreenChatterjee with, from left, Serena, Pratiksha, and Sandeep in the BBC TV series Doctor in the House in 2015.Photograph: Jude Edgington/BBC/Studio LambertI’m a fan of his podcast, though I switch off when he gives airtime to “experts” who sit at the wackier end of the spectrum, such as Joe Dispenza, who advocates manifestation, says woolly things about how energy and the “quantum field” can cure disease, and claims to have healed his broken back using thought. Chatterjee says he decided to pause practising medicine and put his attention instead to raising awareness because: “We’re in a health landscape now where 80 to 90% of what doctors see is driven by our collective modern lifestyles … Whether we’re talking about obesity, type 2 diabetes, anxiety, depression, insomnia, these things are downstream from the way we live our lives.”Chatterjee had become increasingly frustrated that theNHSwasn’t geared up for preventive health. “If you’ve had a heart attack, if you’ve been knocked down in the road, you don’t want lifestyle change, you want the best in modern medicine.” But for many of the health problems doctors see these days, Chatterjee thinks we need a different approach. “Are doctors the best people to see some of the issues that are coming in if they’re driven by lifestyle? What would it look like if every NHS practice in the country had two or three health coaches who also worked there? We need a new approach for prevention.” (This might be the moment to add that Chatterjee is about to launch an individualised programme offering blood tests and health coaching, yours for £249 a year.) What he would like to see is the NHS separated from politics. “If we’re really going to transform it, we need a 30-year plan, not a five-year plan.”Chatterjee’s late father, Tarun, was a doctor who came to the UK in 1962 from India to work in the NHS (his mother followed about 10 years later). In Chatterjee’s latest book,Happy Mind, Happy Life, he wrote about the racism his father faced in his career. “My dad’s mentality, which I think is common in a certain generation of immigrants from India in the 1960s, is we don’t complain, we put our head down and get on with things.” Tarun had worked in obstetrics and gynaecology, and was a skilled surgeon who trained other doctors – people who, year after year, were promoted to consultant positions ahead of him. To become a consultant, he had to move to the less popular specialism of genitourinary medicine.View image in fullscreen‘We need a new approach for prevention’ … Chatterjee at the podcast microphone.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianChatterjee remembers his father working relentlessly. “People like my dad are a net positive to this country. He worked as a consultant in the day, he did GP house calls at night. He worked hard, he paid taxes.” It’s the same all over the NHS, he says. “There are so many phenomenal staff who have come from overseas.”For most of his life, Chatterjee says he absorbed his dad’s mentality: “You don’t complain, you just get on with things.” In late 2018, however, at a meeting at his publishing house, someone (not an employee of the publisher) said that a major retailer had not stocked his first book because “they already had a book on their shelves by an Indian doctor. I remember hearing it. I didn’t say anything. I felt uncomfortable, I think a few people felt uncomfortable, but we just continued our meeting.” He went over it on the train home. The term “Indian doctor” is not accurate. “I was born and brought up in the UK. There was a lot of guilt and shame that came up for me when I thought: I didn’t say anything.” (He did later bring it up with his publisher.)‘Each year you delay giving a phone is a big win’: child screen-time solutions from around the worldRead more“I don’t think people understand, unless you’ve faced discrimination or you’re maybe from an immigrant family, how toxic some of this language is,” says Chatterjee. “The stuff that I’m seeing now on social media, I’m thinking, are we really seeing this in 2026? But we’ve now got political figures all over the world who are very happy to say inflammatory things, which then gives members of the public licence to go: ‘If the person in charge is talking about things this way, I can talk about things this way.’” He is an optimist, he says. “I always believe in humanity, that things will be OK, but I don’t like some of the things that are going on at the moment.”Chatterjee moved back to his home town of Wilmslow, Cheshire, to help care for his father, who was diagnosed with lupus in his late 50s, which caused kidney failure. When his father died in 2013, “that was a massive, significant moment for me, like it is for many people”. He started to re-evaluate his life. He remembers his childhood as very happy, but it was also – familiar to many children of immigrant parents – typified by a pressure to succeed. “If I ever got 19 out of 20 in a test, their first question was always: ‘What did you get wrong?’View image in fullscreen‘The No 1 factor for long-term health, happiness and longevity is the quality of your relationships.’Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“I don’t want this to come across as blaming my parents. Back then, there was quite a lot of discrimination and the way their child doesn’t have to face the struggles they had is to be a straight-A student. I get that, but I think I took on, as a child, the belief that I was only really loved if I got top grades. On one hand, that’s great, it drives you to work hard, you go into a prestigious profession. But I realised that for all my so-called success, I wasn’t actually that happy or content.”He started to separate his sense of self-worth from his achievements. “I realised that where my happiness comes from is the unmeasurables in life.” This was in looking after his father, and now his mother, who lives five minutes away and whom he sees most days.“I’m happily married for 18 years. I’ve got children who I spend a lot of quality time with.” He’s not saying that to sound superior, he says. “I’m saying I’ve understood that actually, I’m prepared to have less ‘societal success’ if necessary, in order to make sure my relationships with my mum, my wife, my children, my friends, are front and centre. We know from the research that the No 1 factor for long-term health, happiness and longevity is the quality of your relationships.”As a child psychiatrist, I see what smartphones are doing to kids’ mental health – and it’s terrifying | Emily SehmerRead moreThere isn’t, he says, “a scorecard for that. I really think we get seduced in the modern world by metrics.”At 48, he says, he has never been happier. After a lot of “inner work”, Chatterjee has identified his values, and tries to live by them, which sounds as if he has been spending too much time with American wellbeing podcasters, even if it also makes sense.“I think the more aligned you get, the more you start to live in harmony with your values,” he says, “the easier life becomes.” Sometimes his work-life balance isn’t right, and his main health vice is coffee. “If you’d asked me six or seven years ago, I would say, when I’m stressed, I will go to sugar. It wasn’t that I didn’t know about the problems with excess sugar use, but knowledge isn’t what we need. A lot of these behaviours come as a way of soothing emotions.”He brings the conversation back to what screen use is doing to all of us, but especially to children. “One thing I worry about is that we start to lose touch with our emotions and how we feel. We’re distracted constantly. And everything good in our lives comes from our ability to be present – our relationships, how we feel about ourselves. We have to be able to be present. And these devices are training distraction.”Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe big interviewGPsSmartphonesHealthHealthcare industryMental healthChildreninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Last week, Rhett Reese, the co-writer of Deadpool & Wolverine, Zombieland and Now You See Me: Now You Don’t, said “it’s likely over for us” after watching a widely disseminated AI-generated clip featuring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting.He added: “In next to no time, one person is going to be able to sit at a computer and create a movie indistinguishable from what Hollywood now releases. True, if that person is no good, it will suck. But if that person possesses Christopher Nolan’s talent and taste (and someone like that will rapidly come along), it will be tremendous.”The first iteration of Seedance launched in June last year.The Motion Picture Association, the Hollywood trade association that represents studios such as Paramount, Warner Bros and Netflix, accused ByteDance of “unauthorised use of US copyrighted works on a massive scale”. The actors’ union Sag-Aftra has accused Seedance of “blatant infringement”.It is the latest clash in Hollywood amid anxiety over the impact of AI on the future of entertainment. Artists and creative industries have called for compensation for theuse of their materialand the establishment of licensing frameworks to enable legal use of their content.Last year,Disney and NBCUniversal sued the AI image generator Midjourneyover what the studios claimed were “endless unauthorised copies” of their works.However, creative companies are also making deals with AI businesses. Last year,Disney announced a $1bn equity investment in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, and a three-year licensing agreement that enables its Sora video generation tool to use some of Disney’s characters.ByteDance and Walt Disney were approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)TikTokTechnology sectorWalt Disney CompanyFilm industryChinanewsShareReuse this content"

It said no parking is allowed on the site between 9pmand6am.There were no signs on the EV charger explaining this, but Ocean has rejected my representation. Mer apologised for the “inconvenience”, but it will not help.DT,Redhill, SurreyThis is one of the most farcical parking disputes I’ve come across. Mer’s website advertises the EV charger as a 24-hour facility. Signs at the entrance to Redhill retail park state, in large letters, that free parking for up to two hours is allowed. Smaller print beneath this says that terms and conditions apply.It’s these terms and conditions that Ocean is relying on, and they are not printed on the entrance signs, or on the sign behind the EV charger.The latter notice bears a line, in a tiny font, obscured by the cable frame, advising drivers to check any parking restrictions. These restrictions are detailed on separate signs around the car park.I began with Mer. It was defensive, insisting that the sign on its charger was adequate, but admitted that the 24-hour promise on its website had caused “confusion”. It has now amended the website. Ocean’s defence was that it had no idea that the charger was in operation until I got in touch, and it had therefore assumed you were merely parking.This is unconvincing. You had detailed in your representation that you were using the charger at the time, and Ocean’s rejection letter stated users of the charger are not exempt from parking restrictions.I jogged Ocean’s memory, but it doubled down. “We maintain that the parking charges were issued correctly under the published conditions,” it said.“However, given that signage in the immediate charging area only met the minimum standard, and Ocean Parking pride themselves on exceeding that, we have taken a pragmatic and fair‑minded approach: all outstanding PCNs relating to that specific location were cancelled, appeals were upheld, and refunds were offered to motorists who had already paid.”In Leicestershire,CHis also caught in the tentacles of a private parking operator after stopping on a road in a business park to drink a cup of coffee. He was slapped with a £100 PCN by Euro Parking Services for parking on “double yellow lines/crosshatched bay” in a “restricted area”. He appealed and was asked to provide evidence that the restrictions were invisibly advertised. So back he went to the site to take photographs.EPS’s response was to fire off another £100 PCN. The CCTV photos attached to this second PCN show him craning to snap a tiny sign, with tiny print, mounted on a pole at least three metres (10ft) high. The photos also show that there are no yellow lines or hatchings on the road.EPS is a member of the trade body International Parking Community (IPC), whose code of practice requires signs to be conspicuous and legible. Member firms must also allow drivers a five-minute grace period to check for parking restrictions.The sign in EPS’s own photos is manifestly not conspicuous nor legible, and its PCN confirms he was on site for 75 seconds, yet EPS refused to cancel either PCN.EPS relented over the second charge when I questioned it, but insisted on upholding the first. “We recognise that drivers need to be able to read and, if necessary, photograph signs in order to submit a representation, and it is not our policy to penalise motorists for doing so,” said the firm which had done exactly thatWe are reviewing the signage at this site to ensure that it is clear, legible and appropriately positioned for all drivers,” it said.CH can appeal to the IPC, but if he loses, he also loses an early payment discount of £40.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.Email us atconsumer.champions@theguardian.comor write to Consumer Champions, Money, the Guardian, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

The platform is now host to reams of content that violate its own guidelines.According to developers who spoke with the Guardian, abuse – particularly directed towards transgender creators – is a fact of life on the platform. “Everyone is at one another’s throats all the time in reviews, discussions, forums, anywhere you can possibly find it on Steam,” says content creator and Steam curator Bri “BlondePizza” Moore. “It ensures no one is safe on the platform; developers and consumers alike.”Aside from the content of Steam’s forums, sources pointed to two main causes for concern: bigoted reviews posted on games’ Steam pages, which can hugely affect sales for their developers; and Steam curators (self-appointed taste-makers on the platform) directing campaigns against games they perceive to lean left or pursue inclusion.“I’m not new to online harassment,” says designer Nathalie Lawhead, who spent two years trying to get reviews removed from their games’ pages.Bothreferenceallegations of sexual assaultthat Lawhead made in 2019. “I assumed reporting Steam abuse might have its own issues. But when people suggested that I open a ticket, I did have hope that this would be the way to get it resolved.”Valve’s refusal to moderate is making Steam reviews and forums the battleground for a culture warÉmi Lefèvre, Studio Plane ToastOne of the reviews, published in 2023, read, “cringe game, made by a liar”. The other, a review of Lawhead’s game Blue Suburbia posted in 2024, said: “A women [sic] who seeks to destroy other’s [sic] career made this. It’s very poorly put together. She also probably has dual Israeli citizenship with how pointy her nose is.”Despite Steam’scode of online conductandcommunity guidelinesprohibiting “abusive language or insults”, public accusations or “discrimination”, moderators initially cleared both reviews after Lawhead reported them.View image in fullscreenA ‘No Woke’ curation list on Steam, where reviewers target games with LGBTQ+ characters.Photograph: SteamSteam does not allow cleared content to be reported again by the same user unless it has been edited. So Lawhead asked others on social media to report the reviews, which prompted Steam to remove the antisemitic example. The other, however, was passed again. “We aren’t in a position to verify the accuracy of statements made in user reviews,” reads a response from Steamsent on 9 January 2026, “and we don’t try to moderate reviews based on accuracy.” Removing reviews, the response claimed, could be seen as “censorship”.“Crushing,” is how Lawhead describes Steam’s missive. “The implication seems to be that I must prove my sexual assault [to Steam] if I want to be protected from harassment over it,” they say. “I am hard-pressed to see where the misunderstanding might be. They had all the information regarding the situation. It’s an obvious stance. It’s a choice.”The remaining review was finally removed, but only after Lawhead personally approached an employee of Steam’s developer, Valve, outside the moderation ecosystem. “This was too much work just for two obviously unjustifiable reviews,” they say, describing having to resolve the issue outside the usual channels as awkward for both parties. “I think this entire process of moderation is broken.”While Lawhead was able to call on public support to help get reviews removed, that is not an option for every developer: not everyone has enough of a following. Others who have gone public with Steam moderation issues have received further harassment, and have asked to speak anonymously or be identified by their first names only.View image in fullscreenCaravan SandWitch, criticised as ‘Too LGBTQ’ in one review.Photograph: Studio Plane ToastSome games have been targeted by Steam curators. Ethan, the developer ofCoven, a first-person action-horror set in the 1600s, says he has been targeted by “CharlieTweetsDetected”, a curator devoted to recommending games based solely on whether their developers are perceived to have correctly mourned the assassination of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk.CharlieTweetsDetected’s review of Coven, a first-person action-horror game set in the 1600s, read simply “Celebrated Sept 10th on blue sky [sic]”. This encouraged others to post further reviews and comments related to Kirk (and not the game). “I even mentioned it to Steam support,” Ethan says, “how it stemmed from that curator list, but they weren’t interested.” Instead, Steam support claimed that “off-topic” constituted “a recipe for cookies, or something completely unrelated to video games that is clearly trolling.” Reviews referencing Kirk, including one reading simply “RIP Charlie Kirk” alongside a negative rating, did not fit that criteria according to Steam;all remain in place today.Elsewhere, campaigns chase games that include trans or LGBTQ+ characters. A trans developer included on acuration list titled “NO WOKE”cites frequent discussion threads, including one that referred to them as a “transvestite” and asked whether their game included “woke faggotry.” Plane Toast’s Émi Lefèvre points toreviewsand discussionsof Caravan SandWitch, a sci-fi action-adventure and driving game, which frequently approach its queer characters negatively. “Too LBGTQ [sic] … There is no future or continuation for these sad gays and lesbians,”reads oneamong many that remain visible on the game’s store page.“For sure, the ‘anti-woke’ curators brought insincere negative attention to the game,” Lefèvre says. “Valve’s refusal to moderate any of this is making Steam reviews and forums the battleground for some kind of culture war, and is making them unsafe for marginalised people and regular gamers trying to simply enjoy the game they bought.”‘Brown space lesbians’ ended up the hardest line in our marketing copyChristina Pollock, developer of Ambrosia SkyThanks to this influx of bad actors, and the lengths that developers need to go to in the hopes of getting hateful content removed from their pages, often without success, many report feeling held hostage by the platform. Steam has becomeessential for developers. It brings in millions of daily users – last monthit had almost 42 million concurrent players– and billions of dollars. “No other storefront has the clout that Steam does,” Lawhead says. “Publishers don’t take you seriously if you’re not on it.”That level of success results inhundreds of thousands of support ticketsevery week. Details about how Valve, a company that hasbeen reported to employ fewer than 400 people, handles its moderation load are elusive. Online consensus, including amongthose formerly involved in Steam’s volunteer moderation programme(retired in 2022), is that the process must be outsourced. The Guardian reached out to Valve on multiple occasions, through multiple channels, for more information and for comment on why moderators clear so many apparent violations of Steam’s guidelines. Valve did not respond to those requests, nor has it made any public comment that the Guardian could find on Steam’s moderation issues.Developer Phi endured an identical process to Ethan and Lawhead upon releasing Heart of Enya in 2021. After escalating a support ticket overtransphobic reviews, Phi received the following response from a Steam agent: “It’s much better to continue working on the product, while letting the community use the helpfulness feature to surface reviews that they agree with or find to be uninformed.” (This exact wording was in Steam support’s response to Lawhead five years later.) “Most of our moderating decisions come down to a yes/no criteria … that’s a frustrating line to walk, and I think it inevitably leaves content that would be considered offensive.”The agent suggested the issue would be discussed with their team, but after five years little appears to have changed.View image in fullscreenTying to contain a fungal outbreak … Ambrosia Sky.Photograph: Soft Rains“To us, it seemed that in Steam’s [view], hateful comments about an individual is abuse – but targeting it towards a group of people is totally fine, that’s welcome speech,” Phi says. “We had no other choice for what to do about transphobia in our reviews. They’re still up there today.”Recourse for developers is limited. Some are looking into their own security, shoring up protections for developers on their team against being doxxed or hacked by trolls. Or, in the case of the developers of Caves of Qud, paying their own moderators to handle forums and the hate that spills out of Steam. Others push bigoted comments into public view in an attempt to cajole Valve, such as No More Robots head Mike Rose, whopushed back against racist reviews of its game Little Rocket Lablast year. “Woke game. Also has muslims,” reads one negative review; “please never, ever play any of our games ever again,” reads Rose’s response.Others are just trying to roll with it. “Brown space lesbians trying and failing to contain a simple fungal outbreak” is, despite its original derogatory intent, “the hardest line in all of our marketing copy”, according toAmbrosia Skydeveloper Christina Pollock.It is increasingly easy, however, for the average consumer to log on to Steam and encounter abuse, bigotry and hate, much of which has been cleared by moderators. And because reviews affect a game’s visibility on Steam, a single negative rating can mean the difference between success and failure. Lax moderation doesn’t just create individual harm but has profound professional and economic implications for developers across the platform.Many of them say they feel forced simply to endure it – unable to walk away from Steam’s near-monopoly onPCgaming. “If I am to continue existing on Steam, I am under the impression that I will have to go through this exhausting ordeal every time I want to report abuse,” Lawhead concludes. “This shouldn’t be normal.”Explore more on these topicsSteamPCGamesRaceLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s almost a metaphor for diplomatic relations between the US and the UKMon 16 Feb 2026 11.53 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 13.59 ESTShareWhen Liz Trusstweeted a photo of herselfstanding next to Donald Trump, she captioned it “right about everything”. All that effort, all that security clearance and long-haul travel and whatnot, to reach the pinnacle of proximity to your spiritual leader, and that’s the best she could come up with? It was bafflingly lame. And yet the least confusing thing about this scene were the words.What exactly is going on in this photo? Truss clearly knows where she is, because she’s grinning with a kind of victorious serenity, as if she’s finally achieved the plaudit she knew all along was hers. At the same time – not wishing to be unsisterly – she doesn’t appear to have brushed her hair, so it doesn’t feel like this photo opportunity was in anyone’s diary. It looks like a selfie you’d catch when you run into your favourite contestant from The Traitors on your way through an airport. No time to worry about your grooming; it’s the chance of a lifetime, every second counts.Trump, meanwhile, looks absolutely mystified. He seems to somehow know he’s meant to smile, but is forcing it so hard it’s rippling down his neck without ever reaching his eyes. His thumb is at half-mast, more like a twitch, a muscle memory, than a signal of enthusiasm. It’s anyone’s guess whether he knows who she is, or why they’re together. Nothing whatsoever about this picture says “leaders on the world stage”, which is fine, because Truss isn’t one. But if she’s not there in a political capacity, how did she finagle the access? Did she just have to drop 50 grand on a plate at a fundraising breakfast?She’s very much off the grownups table – somewhere between a bad fairy godmother and a shambling hecklerYou could stare at this image for ever without figuring out who knows what about how they came to be here and why, but one thing you can pick up immediately: the special relationship, wherein the US apparently loved the UK more than any other European nation, and we reciprocated by loving the US more than we had any business doing, and we talked about it all the time and they talked about it a lot less …thatspecial relationship? It’s over. It would have been better if we’d ended things on grounds of principle, rather than waiting for America to humiliate us bystepping out with our nemesis, but lickspittle dogs don’t always get to choose how relationships end, not even special ones.To recap on Truss’s place in British politics: she was prime minister for only 49 days, which on its own would tell a story of total disaster andignominy, even without all the havoc she wreaked on the economy and people’s mortgages. So much more than a failed political and economic experiment, she’s a figure of ridicule, lampooned for her shorter-than-a-lettuce shelf life by even the rightwing print media that enabled her lamentable rise.And all that is before she started talking. When she launched herYouTube show in December, the chaos-in-a-cupboard vibe slightly contradicted the immense simplicity of her opinions. London is falling, the UK is falling, the west is falling, all because of the deep state and the elites. Hers is a fervent and paranoid tale of perpetual crisis. It’s quite a familiar “alt-right” playbook, which itself borrows its rhythms from the bubbly hysteria of timeless totalitarianism. And in terms of UK politics, it situates her as very much off the grownups’ table – somewhere between a bad fairy godmother and a shambling heckler. Her long game, we can leave for another day; Donald Trump standing next to her, whether he knows who she is or not, is very much today’s question. What does it say? We’re dumped, guys. Time to face up to it and find a new special relationship.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLiz TrussOpinionDonald TrumpConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

But to declare its demise would be prematureMon 16 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 09.15 ESTShareIs international humanitarian law (IHL), the law designed to spare civilians as much as possible the hazards of warfare, at risk of imploding? That is the conclusion of a new compendiousstudyof current armed conflicts around the world, citing the killing of civilians and other atrocities in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and elsewhere. “While the threat to IHL is not yet existential,” it warns, “it is at a critical breaking point.”There is no doubt that the disregard for civilian life in these conflicts has been horrendous. In Gaza andSudan, it has risen to the level of genocide. But do these represent serious violations of the law or its demise?Let’s consider an analogy: when an ordinary murder is committed on a city street, is that a serious crime or a license to kill? If the authorities investigate, arrest and prosecute the suspect, we consider the murder an unfortunate offense but don’t question the status of the law against it. But if the authorities were to ignore the killing, suggesting that they are just as happy to be rid of the victim, it would be another matter entirely.By the same token, the key to understanding whether the lethal conflicts of recent years spell the dissolution of IHL is to examine the reaction. The response has been mixed, weaker than it should be, but still considerable. That leads me to believe it premature to pronounce IHL dead.Take Gaza. There is no denying that the government of Benjamin Netanyahu has ripped up the Geneva conventions and their protocols – the main codification of IHL. The Israeli militaryhasindiscriminately bombed neighborhoods, attacked military targets when it knew the civilian toll would be disproportionate, deliberately fired on civilians, and deprived civilians of food and other necessities.Yet the international response has hardly been a shrug. The UN security council isstymiedby theveto– in this case Washington’s – but repeated condemnations have been issued by the UNgeneral assemblyand the UNhuman rights council, where there is no veto. The monitoring mechanisms established by the council have issued regularreportsand even have found Israel to have committedgenocidein Gaza. The international court of justice is hearing agenocidecase against Israel brought by South Africa – now joined byothers– and has demanded Israelendits illegal occupation. The international criminal court (ICC) haschargedNetanyahu and his former defense chief, Yoav Gallant, with war crimes and crimes against humanity for starving and depriving civilians.Of course some responses have been far weaker. The US government in particular has continued to funnelarmsandbillionsof dollars to the Israeli military. But given the extensive global outrage at Israel’s slaughter, Washington looks more like an accomplice to atrocities than a reason to declare the death of the law protecting civilians.The response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine tells a similar story. Russia’svetohas blocked security council action, but thegeneral assemblyandhuman rights councilhave issued condemnations. The council set up monitoring and reporting mechanisms for Russia’s war crimes inUkraineand repression inat home. The ICC has charged the Russian president, VladimirPutin, and another official with kidnapping Ukrainian children, andfourRussian commanders with attacking civilian electrical infrastructure in Ukraine. Many governments have imposedsanctionson Russia, althoughChinaand others continue to buy its oil, essentially financing the atrocities. The global reaction can hardly be said to accept Putin’s illegal conduct.The international reaction has been weaker but still considerable to today’s two most dire situations in Africa – the civil war in Sudan and Rwanda’s invasion of eastern DR Congo. On Sudan, the security council hascondemnedthe atrocities, although the general assembly hasnotacted. The human rights council has alsocondemnedthe severe abuses andestablisheda monitoring and reporting mechanism which hasspokenout, as have other UNexperts. The ICC prosecutors havebriefedthe security council on their investigation of recent atrocities in Sudan but have yet to publicly issue charges.The United Arab Emirates is the principalsourceof arms for the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as it commits genocide, slaughtering and raping Black African civilians in areas it takes over. But so far the UAE’s wealth hassparedit the public condemnation of western governments.As for eastern DRC, the UN security council (but not the general assembly) hascondemnedRwanda’s invasion via its M23 proxy rebel group. The human rightscouncildeplored the abuses and established a monitoring and reporting mechanism that hasissuedcritical reports. TheICCis investigating (though has not yet publicly filed charges for) the atrocities and has endorsed the creation of a special tribunal for the region.Yet the international response has not been as strong as in the past. In 2013,threatsfrom London and Washington to cut aid forced the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, to stop supporting the murderous M23 rebel group that was wreaking havoc among the civilians of eastern DRC. The threats led to the M23’s collapse.Now the M23 is back, but the pro-western Kagame is being treated with kid gloves. Aided by Qatar, the Trump administration negotiated aceasefirethat Rwanda hasignoredwithout consequence. Trump’s maininterestappears to be DRC mining deals. By opting not to pressure Rwanda to end its invasion, Trump essentially greenlighted its exploitation of DRC’s mineral wealth, the civilians of the region be damned.The ICC is the obvious institution to uphold the law and prosecute offenders. Trump has sought to undermine the court by imposingsanctionson some of its prosecutors and judges, mainly for pursuing or upholding charges against Netanyahu and Gallant. But these officials havedefiedTrump’s pressure and vowed to continue their work.One serious impediment has been self-imposed. Since May 2025, the prosecutor’s office has been headless because Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor, is onleavewhile allegations that he sexually assaulted a staff member are investigated. (Khan has denied the allegations.) Rather than expeditiously resolve the matter by vindicating or firing him, the assembly of states parties – the court’s125members – has dawdled. The investigator’s report has been with them sinceDecember, but they still haven’t acted. This is irresponsible.The prosecutor’s office is being run by twodeputies, but they don’t have the stature to take the major decisions that are onhold. For example, no Israeli officials have been publicly charged for any aspect of the bombing campaign in Gaza or the settlement expansion (also awar crime) in the occupied West Bank. Putin has not been publicly charged for the bombing of civilians and civilian infrastructure under his command in Ukraine.No public charges have been filed against commanders committing atrocities in Sudan or eastern DRC, let alone against the Emirati and Rwandan officials who are aiding and abetting them. Trump and his senior officials have not been charged with obstructing justice, which his sanctions clearlydo. Given the enormous stakes, the member states should act urgently so a permanent chief prosecutor is in place.The challenges to IHL are certainly great. I would have liked to see a far stronger response. But it would be wrong to characterize that response to this lawlessness as the death knell of IHL – as the way we must accept that wars are now fought. The atrocities in Gaza,Ukraine, Sudan and eastern DRC are still rightly and widely seen as wrong, as illegal. We just need a more consistent effort to defend the victims and uphold the law.Kenneth Roth is a Guardian US columnist, visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs, and former executive director of Human Rights Watch.

The racist imagery Trump posted was so egregious that the video’s misogyny representing Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as animals was overlooked. Trump’s denigration of women is implicitly assumed as business-as-usual and not newsworthy: “Quiet, piggy!” And down the memory hole are the 3m long-suppressed documents from the Epstein files in which he is mentioned in its unredacted pages “more than a million times”, according to the Democratic representative Jamie Raskin, who was permitted access.The only Black Republican US senator, Tim Scott of South Carolina, said of the Obama portrayal: “It’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House,” though Scott did not disclose any list, which could have been drawn from an encyclopedia of offenses beginningdecades beforeTrump’s birther campaign. During Trump’s first administration, in 2020, Scott chose to call out one incident as “indefensible”: Trump’s tweet of a video of a supporter chanting “white power”. Trump’s latest racist post was preceded on 11 January by his predictable vandalism of Black History Month in aninterviewwith the New York Times with a remark about the Civil Rights Act of 1964: “White people were very badly treated.”The release of Trump’s Obama video runs parallel to his systematic purge of references to slavery at numerous national parks and sites, following hisexecutive orderof 27 March 2025, “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”. At Fort Pulaski national monument in Georgia, for example, Trump officials ordered the removal of a reproduction of the infamous1863 “Scourged Back” photographof an enslaved man named Gordon with severe whipping scars. At Harpers Ferry national historical park, signs about slavery wereflagged for removal. At theKingsley plantationin Florida, exhibits of the harsh living conditions of enslaved people were ordered for inventory. The historical information at President’s House in Philadelphia noting George Washington’s slaves’ presence therewas removed.But Trump’s video and remark about civil rights has its own inescapable history. However ignorant, indifferent or contemptuous of history he may be, he has evoked the language and imagery of theinaugural addressof Governor George C Wallace of Alabama on 14 January 1963, in which Wallace decried “the tyranny that clanks its chains upon the south”, and “the international racism of the liberals seek[ing] to persecute the international white minority”, in order to transform Americans into a “mongrel unit of one under a single all-powerful government”,Mongrelization, what Wallacecalled“mongrel complexity”, was in effect Trump’s theme in his tweet about the performance of Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl half-time show. Bad Bunny, a Puerto Rican recording artist who won the Grammy this year for best album, is a critic of ICE and sings in Spanish. His performance at the Super Bowl culminated in a parade of flags, ending with that of the US and his statement “God bless America”.“It makes no sense,”complainedTrump, “is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence. Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.” Perhaps Trump is confusing Bad Bunny with Elvis, and the early objections to his dancing and his Spanish-language songGuadalajarain his 1963 movie Fun in Acapulco.In the memes of identity politics, Trump as puritan is a novelty comedy act.The Trump White House’s shambling explanation of the Obama video, trying to shift blame toan anonymous staffer, suggested an internal operation postingAI-generatedimages and videos. In October last year, Trump wasmade into a jet pilotwho bombs protesters with excrement. On 22 January, just weeks before the Obama video, the White House communications office disseminated analtered photoof Nekima Levy Armstrong, a prominent Black woman, arrested at an anti-ICE demonstration in St Paul, Minnesota, in which her skin color appears darkened and her face changed to make her appear to be crying. (Armstrong is the former director of the Minneapolis NAACP and a former law school professor.) After the digital manipulation of the Armstrong photo was exposed, Kaelan Dorr, deputy White House communications director,posted on X: “The memes will continue.”Initially, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt,defended the Obama videoas an “internet meme” and the reaction to it as “fake outrage”. Yet in the Armstrong instance, Trump’s White House wasproudly defiantabout producing it, not dismissive. Condemning “fake outrage” is the transparent projection of the outrage the Trump team regularly attempts to whip up through deepfakes. There was the doctored video in October 2025 of the Democratic House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, wearing a sombrero with mariachi music playing. “Bigotry will get you nowhere,”saidJeffries. But bigotry is the fuel of the memes.The White House’s posting operation runs from the deputy chief of staff, Dan Scavino,dubbed“the conductor of the Trump Train”, through the communications and press offices. (The White House has saidScavino wasn’t behindthe Obama post.) Leavitt’s particular role is to practice her talent for rapid-fire mendacity, instantly framing falsehoods and deflecting responsibility with an air of certitude as she is making it up.In Trump’s fumbled alibi about the Obama video, he disclosed his operation. “I didn’t see the whole thing,” Trumpsaid. “I looked at the first part … Then I gave it to the people. Generally, they look at ​the whole thing. But I guess somebody didn’t.” A phantom was blamed. Trump defended the video, half-confessing that he had given his approval. “I didn’t make a mistake,” he said.Trump’s memes are more than distractions, heckling or the self-delusions of a cult shouting into an echo chamber. Just as the Obama video was neatly succeeded by the Bad Bunny tweet, Trump’s racist rants have melded with nativist nationalism. The two episodes together crystalize his political philosophy.Like virtually all of Trump’s policies, from tariffs to immigration, and the AI cartoons of his White House image machine, Maga as a whole is an atavistic recrudescence, the return of the repressed. It is a recapitulation of the dark side of American history that cohered into the racist and nativist nationalism of a century ago in the 1920s.The Obama video is a modern repetition of the pseudo-scientific racist theory of polygenism, propounded first in the 1854 book Types of Mankind by Josiah Nott and George Gliddon, filled with illustrations of the “Negro” head to show its resemblance to a chimpanzee rather than a “Caucasian” skull to prove a natural racial hierarchy. Nottarguedthat “the negro achieves his greatest perfection, physical and moral, and also greatest longevity, in a state of slavery”.The literature of race-thinking grew to a vast proportion. In 1916, Madison Grant notably publishedThe Passing of the Great Race, a combination of social Darwinism, racism and nativism, particularly focused on the Jews destroying Nordic “purity [of] the blood”. “The agitation over slavery was inimical to the Nordic race,” he wrote, “because it thrust aside all national opposition to the intrusion of hordes of immigrants of inferior racial value, and prevented the fixing of a definite American type …” Grant served as vice-president of the Immigration Restriction League and an adviser on the Immigration Act of 1924, which prohibited eastern and central Europeans from the US. Hitler cited Grant’s book in Mein Kampf andpraisedit as “my Bible”.The second Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s emerged as enormously powerful not only as a white supremacist organization but also as a nativist one that ranked whites by nationality and blood. The 1925Klansman’s Manualstated as its “purpose”: “To unite white male persons, native-born, Gentile citizens of the United States of America”, and said “the movement is dedicated to the task of preserving the blood-purity, the integrity, the traditions, the ideals and the heritages of the white race in America”. (Fred Trump, Donald’s father, wasarrestedas a young man at a Klan rally in 1927.)Trump dabbles in Hitlerian rhetoric without the theory: “poisoning the blood” was afavorite phraseof his during the 2024 campaign. (Trumphas said he didn’t knowthis echoed Hitler.) He links blood purity to nativism with lurid depictions of immigrants as “animals” degraded by “bad genes”.The man for theory, at least one theory, in his circle is the author of his immigration policy and field marshal of ICE, Stephen Miller, who hasreportedlysought topromotea white supremacist novel, The Camp of the Saints, written in 1973 by Jean Raspail, which describes brown-skinned people from the Indian subcontinent invading and overwhelming white Europe. (The White Househas claimed Miller opposesall forms of bigotry.) Raspail was a far-right French monarchist and his work a forerunner of the great replacement theory that provides the framework, if there is one, for Maga.“This is the great lie of mass migration,”wroteMiller on X. “You are not just importing individuals. You are importing societies. No magic transformation occurs when failed states cross borders. At scale, migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands.” Miller’sgreat-great-grandfatherfled pogroms in Belarus and arrived at Ellis Island in 1903.And, Miller tweeted: “NYC is the clearest warning yet of what happens to a society when it fails to control migration.” Ad infinitum.The memes will continue.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

Abbott wants a return to immigration policies ofthe 50s, 60s and 70sbut without specifically mentioning the White Australia policy. Beyond the strengthening of the character test through potential listing of hate groups that was recently passed by parliament, what would that involve?At present, when a person is granted a permanent or temporary visa, they must digitally sign off on anAustralian values statement. This includes values such as respect for the freedom and dignity of the individual, freedom of religion, commitment to the rule of law and parliamentary democracy, equality of opportunity, a “fair go” for all and recognising English as the national language.When a person signs off on these, they acknowledge and undertake to conduct themselves according to the values. The aim is “to help new residents understand the values that have helped to create a society that is stable and cohesive but, at the same time, dynamic and ​diverse”. At present, a visa holder cannot have their visa cancelled if they don’t fully live up to these values unless they also breach the character test.Migrants from Gaza and Somalia among those to be banned from Australia under unreleased Liberal planRead morePermanent residents also have to sit a test that goes to these values if and when they apply for Australian citizenship.So how will Taylor strengthen the test of Australian values?While it’s possible to consider requiring permanent and temporary visa applicants to sit a more searching test of Australian values before they are granted a visa, that is unlikely to result in many people failing, assuming the test was conducted in a language of their choosing. If it was run only in English, many more people would fail not because they didn’t support Australian values but because of the complexity of the language.The test would have to be conducted at a physical location to prevent people using AI to answer the questions. The cost of operating such a test would be large and most likely clog up an already heavily backlogged visa system. Other than an opportunity to run some political rhetoric, little would actually be achieved.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAleaked Liberal party immigration plan, drafted under the former leader Sussan Ley, proposed banning migrants from specific regions of 13 countries – including from Gaza, Afghanistan and Somalia. The policy would also see some migrants on temporary visas deported for breaching “Australian values”.Three problems arise with this. First, how do we judge if a visa holder has breached an Australian value but has not also breached the character test which would enable visa cancellation anyway? Second, many people who do not live up to Australian values are citizens. Cancelling citizenship is very difficult as Peter Dutton found out when his laws were overturned by the high court. Third, such a policy could result in sending people back to places where they may be persecuted or even killed – is that really something theLiberal partyis willing to support?Pauline Hanson’s chief of staff, James Ashby, has suggested copying Donald Trump’s approach of suspending visa application processing for75 listed countries(or at least using that as a starting point). Interestingly, that list of countries does not include India, which was the birthplace of the older of the alleged Bondi terrorists. India may have been too big a country to be included in the banned list.The Liberal party’s plan proposed a similar approach but for a smaller number of countries, and would essentially mean abandoning the non-discriminatory migration policy we have had in place since the mid-1970s as affirmed by a parliamentary motion introduced by Bob Hawke in 1989 in response to John Howard’s comments that we were receiving too many migrants from Asia.Banning permanent and temporary migration from certain countries would require amendments to both the Migration Act and the Racial Discrimination Act. Essentially, it would mean abolition of our humanitarian program as most of this is currently sourced from the listed countries. It also means that if an Australian citizen or permanent resident marries someone from one of these countries, they could not live together in Australia unless an exemption was provided.Finally, we have to consider what such proposals would do to social cohesion. While Abbott and Taylor may not like it, Australia is a multicultural nation. Nothing is going to change that no matter what rhetoric politicians use or what laws they introduce. It will be seen by migrants from many nations, not just from the targeted nations, as making them second class. It will traumatise the second and third-generation children of migrants.Ironically, Taylor and Abbott’s rhetoric is itself contrary to a number of Australian values including the “fair go” for all that embraces ​mutual respect, tolerance, compassion for those in need and equality of opportunity for all. One would have thought that if politicians wanted to promote Australian values, they would try to exhibit some themselves!But then, political expediency always trumps the importance of social cohesion – and indeed logic.Abul Rizvi is a former deputy immigration­ ­secretaryExplore more on these topicsAustralian immigration and asylumOpinionLiberal partyCoalitionAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Why are we squeezing graduates harder than the super-rich?Gaby HinsliffReform of this stealth tax is long overdue – and with it, a shake-up of the whole university systemMon 16 Feb 2026 12.38 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 14.09 ESTShareNever go to war with Martin Lewis. The one iron law of politics is that the financial guru who built moneysavingexpert.com has a quasi-godlike status in Britain, the man millions trust with their cash in a way they would never trust any politician. If he takes up a cause, he usually wins. So when Lewisjoined the revoltagainst recent changes to the student loan system, urging young graduates to lobby their MPs in protest, trouble was never going to be far behind.And now apparently it’s here. Last week, the Green party leader, Zack Polanski,called for“a conversation about student debt forgiveness”, echoing arallying cryamong young Democrat voters at the last US election for loans to be written off faster (though he didn’t explain where he would find the billions that would cost). Shortly afterwards, five former education secretaries – including Labour’s David Blunkett –publicly backeda Sunday Times campaign for admittedly more modest reforms to student finance. It looks like the slow-burning anger of graduates who went to university in England and Wales between 2012 and 2023 – on a plan that walloped them withhigher interest ratesthan those who went before or after – is finally starting to set Westminster alight.Student loan repayments of up to 9% means some of theseso-called Plan 2graduatesface effective marginal tax ratesof 49% or more, in England and Wales, where even the super-rich pay only 45%. It’s a generational injustice that rankles: why are young people being squeezed proportionately harder in some cases than their bosses? Isn’t it tough enough already to save up for a first flat, or start a family, without hanging yet more millstones round their necks?NUS urges ‘loan shark’ Reeves to reverse changes to student debt repaymentRead moreAnd then there’s the dispiriting sense of throwing money into a bottomless pit. Since only the highest earners will ever contribute enough to outrun that galloping interest rate and actually clear the loan, many of the rest are now realising that despite years of conscientiously paying their dues, their debts have actuallygrownrather than shrunk. (Even when you’re on maternity leave, the interest keeps ticking up relentlessly.) The 29-year-old Labour backbencher Nadia Whittomerecently pointed outthat even she has managed to make only a £1,000 dent in her £49,600 debt after six years on an MP’s salary, so how on earth is anyone else supposed to do it? Though anything this crop of graduates still owes will be written off after 30 years, that still potentially leaves them paying well into middle age for decisions made back in sixth form.What really tipped rebellious graduates over the edge, however, was the chancellor Rachel Reeves’ decision in the budget tofreeze the threshold(the salary level where graduates have to start repaying) at £29,385 for Plan 2 until 2030, squeezing a few more millions out of them. Her argument that graduates are now better off, thanks to falling interest rates, cut no ice with Lewis, who argues that it’s not what graduates signed up to, and that moving the goalposts like thisisn’t“a moral thing” to do. Enter the Greens, who promised in their last manifesto to scrap student loans altogether, and who are now palpably keen to capitalise on what the pollster YouGov says is anemerging lead over Labouramong the under-30s.Student debt forgiveness never used to feature in political conversation on this side of the Atlantic, but then nor did leaving college withaverage debts of £53,000– or more if you do a master’s, as young people increasingly feel panicked into doing if they want to bolster their CVs in a hideously competitive jobs market. (Startlingly, English students now graduate withhigher average debtseven than Americans, whose system has always been a byword for cripplingly expensive fees.) If anything, the backlash is only likely to grow as the next lot of post-2023 students – who faithfully did what their teachers said they should do and worked hard to get to university – begin graduating into a jobs market that didn’t have enough genuine graduate opportunities to go round, even before AI started gobbling up entry-level work.View image in fullscreenChancellor Rachel Reeves visiting the OpenReach training centre in Crawley, West Sussex, on Thursday 12 February.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAI was speaking at a university careers fair at the weekend, packed with almost frighteningly impressive students who are keen enough to turn up on a Sunday to polish their internship applications but who still find themselves wading through rejection letter after rejection letter. This is the supposed golden ticket for which, after graduating, some may be expected to pay for in their 60s. (Though thankfully they face lower interest rates than the Plan 2 generation, which ought to make the debt easier to clear, these younger graduates will start repaying earlier – in fact as soon asthey earn £25,000, dangerously close to what will soon be minimum wage – and for longer, with debt only finally written offafter 40 years).Britain may well now be at the beginning of a painful transition towards higher taxes for everyone,at least if it wants both tofix its public services and bolster its defences against arising global threatin a hurry. The long peace dividend that made things like free university education possible is over, replaced by what might be called the Trump tax, or the unwanted price of living in a world made more dangerous by the US losing its bearings. But to start that transition by squeezing the young, rather than those old enough to have actually benefited from the good times while they lasted, feels completely backwards. If we are in this, the generations should all be in it together.The Guardian view on student loans: a graduate levy by stealth is no way to fund the NHS | EditorialRead moreThe fairest option is probably to cap how much any student should have to pay over their lifetime, so that loans bear some resemblance to what was borrowed rather than just morphing into a kind of stealth graduate tax. But that would be expensive, most likely requiring a shake-up of the university system into the bargain.Though more apprenticeships might be part of the answer, they can’t simply be magicked out of thin air. (Apprentices need actual work to learn on, which requires an economy growing strongly enough to create it.) If anything, the UK has spent too long arguing in circles about how many people should go to university and not enough time thinking about what they do when they get there. One option is to offer shorter and cheaper degrees, compressing three years’ study into two – which should be easier than it was, given how many universities have already cut teaching time or shifted to teaching over two semesters rather than three terms.But if the government has better options, then let’s hear them sooner rather than later.

In fertility medicine, this dismissal is compounded by an industry structured around efficiency rather than careMon 16 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 17.31 ESTShare“The female body is such a mystery.”The fertility specialist said it lightly, almost kindly, from behind his desk. I was there because my partner and I had been trying for a second child without success. At the time, our son was two. We had conceived him naturally and relatively quickly, so after months of negative pregnancy tests I knew that something was off.I told the specialist that I had been experiencing severe pain each month, and that it was getting worse. But it was as though the pain I was describing belonged to some unknowable realm beyond medicine, rather than to my actual body, sitting across from him.I went to a different fertility specialist and heard much the same thing. The pain was again treated as incidental, unrelated and something to be endured rather than investigated. I was prescribed ovulation-inducing medication and sent on my way.Anna longed for a second child. Coming to terms with secondary infertility meant letting go of her fixed notion of family | Bianca DennyRead moreOver the next three years, I saw multiple specialists. Each time, the pattern repeated. Blood tests, charts, timelines and, always, eventually, the same conclusion: unexplained secondary infertility. I followed advice. I took medications and hormones. I changed my diet and my lifestyle. I tracked my cycle obsessively. I had blood drawn again and again, injected hormones into my stomach, had internal ultrasounds, timed intercourse and rounds of IUIs. I tried acupuncture, Chinese medicine and pretty much every fertility supplement my Instagram algorithm threw my way. I was monitored, measured, poked and prodded. My body became a site of constant intervention. All the while, I was told to relax. Stay positive. Don’t think about it too much. I waited, I hoped and, every month, like clockwork, I watched another pregnancy test turn negative.Each negative result carried its own grief. But layered on top was something harder to name: the exhaustionof not being believed. The psychological toll of being told, implicitly, that your suffering is unrelated, irrelevant, or simply “one of those things”.IVF was presented as the logical next step: efficient, protocol-driven, almost inevitable. But something in me resisted. It wasn’t denial, or fear, or a lack of understanding about IVF. It was a gut feeling, quiet but insistent, that we were overlooking something fundamental. That my pain mattered. That my body was trying to tell me something.Just as I was about to give up on that gut feeling, I heard an interview with a US-based obstetrician-gynaecologist who challenged the idea of “unexplained infertility”, suggesting it often means the work simply hasn’t been done yet. That not all the rocks have been turned over. This idea lodged somewhere deep. It gave shape to what I’d been feeling all along: that something had been missed. I booked an appointment with one last fertility specialist. One more opinion. One more rock.‘Unexplained’ is not a diagnosis. It’s a failure of imagination, time, or willingnessSo there I was again, in another consulting room, describing the pain – pain that by then was well and trulyaffecting my ability to work and function. I braced myself for the same response, but something different happened. She paused. She listened. And then said, almost casually, “we should do a laparoscopy”.Within a month, I was in surgery. Within weeks, I was pregnant.The surgery itself revealed how much had been missed. What was expected to be a relatively straightforward procedure took far longer than anticipated. The laparoscopy found extensive endometriosis, some of it wrapped around nerves and forming its own blood supply. It was both devastating and vindicating. There it was, the thing I had felt in my body all along, finally named. The mystery evaporated instantly. My infertility was no longer “unexplained”. It had simply been ignored.I wish I could say the moment brought uncomplicated joy, but instead it cracked something open. Alongside relief and gratitude sat a grief so sharp it took my breath away. I grieved the years I had lost. Years of pain. Years of work opportunities that slipped away when my body couldn’t conform to timelines that assume women’s bodies won’t interrupt progress. Years of emotional whiplash – hope, despair, repeat.Endometriosis affects an estimated one in nine women in Australia, yetdiagnosis takes, on average, seven to 10 years. Women’s pain is routinely minimised. In fertility medicine, this dismissal is compounded by an industry structured around efficiency and throughput rather than curiosity and care.IVF itself is not the villain here. For many, it is life changing and essential. But when it becomes the default response – when it is offeredbefore underlying causes are thoroughly investigated– it risks becoming a conveyor belt. Women are processed rather than heard. Symptoms are managed rather than understood.“Unexplained” is not a diagnosis. It’s a failure of imagination, time, or willingness.I am pregnant now. I am grateful. But that doesn’t erase the cost of getting there. What remains is the knowledge that if I hadn’t trusted my instincts, if I hadn’t refused to accept “mystery” as an answer, I might still be waiting.Whenwomen’s pain is repeatedly minimised, in medicine, in work, in systems designed for efficiency rather than care, something has to signal that harm has occurred. Sometimes, that signal is anger. Not as an overreaction, but as evidence. Not something to be soothed away, but something asking to be examined.So yes, I am angry for myself, but also for the countless women who are still being told gently, confidently, that their bodies are mysteries. They’re not – they just deserve to be listened to.Katie Found is a Melbourne-based writer and film-makerExplore more on these topicsFertility problemsOpinionPregnancyWomen's healthFamilyParents and parentingHealthEndometriosiscommentShareReuse this content"

Almost 200 years after publication, Emily Brontë’s tale of forbidden love and ruthless revenge inspires a devotion that makes any reinterpretation feel like a personal and proprietary affront.Into this sea of sensitivities has plunged the director Emerald Fennell, whosenew adaptationhas become one of the year’s most debated films. Dubbed “50 shades of Brontë”, everything about it has been scrutinised: from the casting of Aussies Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi as Cathy and Heathcliff to the anachronistic costumes and music, and the overt sexualisation of the plot.Detractors claim Brontë must be spinning in her grave, but this film tells us far more about contemporary culture than it does about the 19th-century novel itself. Fennell has framed the project as a highly personal interpretation, shaped by her intense response to the book at 14 – hence the inverted commas around the title.She has spoken of being “obsessed” and “driven mad” by the book, of wanting to honour its “primal, sexual” undercurrents and the shock that greeted its original publication (it was deemed “irredeemably monstrous” at the time). Purists are outraged that a novel rooted in class and racial tensions that exposes the extremes to which someone can be driven by desire and pride has been simplified to “the greatest love story ever told”. But in an attention economy only the simplest and most shocking narratives cut through.In the infinite scroll of content platforms, we are fed a steady diet of instant gratification and vibes, with diminishing space for thoughtful engagement. We live in an age where book publishing has become enmeshed with social media, asBookTokdrives sales by isolating easily digestible tropes such as “enemies to lovers”, “slow burn” and “who did this to you?”. Fennell thrives in this landscape – her films are less concerned with subtlety or nuance than with provocation. Her previous film Saltburn was a talking point not because of its delicate tensions, but for its shocking scenes of a sexual nature.View image in fullscreenMargot Robbie and Jacob Elordi at the Wuthering Heights Australian premiere in Sydney, 12 February 2026.Photograph: Hanna Lassen/Getty ImagesSo Fennell’s “Wuthering Heights” (note the quotation marks) opens with an aroused nun observing a hanged man with an erection. Cathy masturbates under a huge heathland rock while her hot surrogate brother watches on; Alison Oliver’s Isabella wears a dog collar on all fours as Heathcliff feeds her; fingers suggestively penetrate jellied fish mouths and egg yolks. This is Brontë for the permanently online generation, and it’s designed to be clipped, shared and debated.The casting, too, can be understood through this logic. Much of the backlash has focused on the decision to cast older actors, and to overlook Brontë’s description of Heathcliff as a “dark-skinned gipsy”, racially and socially othered. Those are valid criticisms. But if this Wuthering Heights is engineered for a culture shaped by virality, then its leads were always going to be stars who already existed as online darlings. Robbie is Barbie, and Elordi is everyone’s favourite internet boyfriend. Set all this against an ethereal soundtrack by the gen Z-adored Charli xcx and the method is unmistakable.‘I loved it!’: Brontë museum staff praise racy Wuthering Heights filmRead moreAdaptations of classics are always tricky, but there is nothing inherently sinful about each generation wanting period drama refracted through a new lens. Bridgerton transformed Regency romance into a glossy, sex-positive fantasy, while Netflix’s forthcoming Pride and Prejudice is penned by Dolly Alderton, the chronicler of millennial love and desire. If Clueless could transplant Jane Austen to 90s California, Fennell is well within her rights to create a sexed-up Wuthering Heights. My only complaint is that, for all the noise around its supposed transgression, it is surprisingly un-freaky, beyond a few flirtations with BDSM.Still, when I saw it on Friday night, the cinema was packed. There were squeals, gasps and, yes, tears. It was an entertaining fever dream, with beautiful cinematography and a final sequence that leaves you devastated. When fewer people are going to film theatres, it should be welcome that “Wuthering Heights”has recouped its$80m production budgeton its opening weekend. Event cinema sells tickets.Luckily, Brontë fans who can’t abide this film have countless alternatives that cleave more faithfully to the novel’s spirit, including the 1939 version with Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier, 1992’s take with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes and Andrea Arnold’s 2011 film. They should also be reassured that the controversy around the film has driven renewed interest in the book itself, withUK sales up 469% over the past year. That is one good thing Fennell lovers and haters can agree on.Nadia Khomami is arts and culture correspondent at the GuardianExplore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsOpinionEmerald FennellEmily BrontëRomance filmscommentShareReuse this content"

That’s just a new Maga trapMon 16 Feb 2026 05.41 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 11.30 ESTShareThe good news from the Munich Security Conference is that there was no dramatic deterioration in the transatlantic relationship. After the shock of last year’s event, whenJD Vance stunned the audience with a frontal US attackon Europe’s liberal democracies, the seemingly moreconciliatory tone struck by Marco Rubiowas greeted by many present, including Wolfgang Ischinger, a veteran German diplomat and the conference chair, as “reassuring”. Indeed, the US secretary of state got a standing ovation in the room – a gesture perhaps more of relief than of adulation. But is the Trump administration’s message to Europe really any different now from that contained in Vance’s assault 12 months ago? What traps are being laid and what lessons should Europeans draw?A year ago, Vance accused Europe of succumbing to the alleged tyranny and censorship of woke liberals and losing sight of the cultural bonds that link the two shores of the Atlantic. His attack baffled European leaders, who, while often prone to navel-gazing about their internal struggles, do not consider restrictions on free speech a primary concern. The US vice-president shocked Munich by insisting that Europe’s biggest threat was the woke “threat from within”, even as he endorsed far-right nationalists includingGermany’s AfD. The insult was so deep that this year the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, used his opening address to issue a blunt warning about American unilateralist values,declaring that“the culture war of the Maga movement is not ours”.With Europeans desperate for reassurance, they were eager for any signs of transatlantic solidarity in Rubio’s speech. The secretary of state offered warm words, celebrating the shared cultural heritage, history and specifically the Christianity of the west. He claimed that the US, a “child of Europe”, was not interested in managing western decline but instead determined to spearhead a western civilisational renaissance.But beneath the surface, Rubio’s speech this year and Vance’s in 2025 were two sides of the same coin. Vance’s was crude and outrageous, even silly. At a time when there is democratic backsliding in most regions of the world, to claim that Europe’s biggest problem is a lack of free speech is simply ridiculous.Rubio’s speech was more subtle and coherent, but he in essence sang from the same hymn sheet: the message from Washington remains that Europe and the US should be defined by ethno-political values of culture, tradition and religion. The fact that such history has also bred nationalism, racism, fascism and colonialism is apparently nothing to be ashamed of.In Europe, we may have thought that we had turned the page, defining the continent in opposition to its past – embracing civic and Enlightenment values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law, multilateralism, inclusion and integration, and rejecting the scourge of nationalism. But for the standard bearers of the Maga movement, it is nationalism that is to be celebrated. The rules-based order is not just dead, as European leaders themselves recognise; it is, in Rubio’s characterisation, outright “foolish”.But if western civilisation is to be nurtured while rules are not, the vision Rubio outlined is fundamentally one of empire. In this imagining, the Americas and Europe are bound by ancestry and religion; “connected spiritually”, as Rubio put it. Proud nationalist forces on both sides of the Atlantic must jointly battle globalism, cancel culture and the “civilisational erasure” that mass migration supposedly threatens.But the “western century” will be marked by raw power, exercised first and foremost within the empire itself by the strong – the US – against the weak: small and medium-sized European countries, Canada and South American states. Within the empire, there can and should be institutions, starting withNato. But the US intention is crystal clear: you pay up – which is fair – but we still call the shots, which is not. There will be other empires in the world, including Russia and China, and the American empire will compete with them. Yet it is also ready to cooperate, perhaps even collude, especially if the price for collusion is to be paid by its colonial subjects.Rubio’s message was more sophisticated and strategic than Vance’s. But it was just as dangerous, if not more so, precisely because it lowered the transatlantic temperature and may have lulled Europe into a false sense of calm. As Benjamin Haddad, France’s Europe minister, said in Munich, the European temptation may be to press the snooze button once again.There are good reasons to believe this will not happen. Merz, along with Emmanuel Macron, Keir Starmer, Pedro Sánchez and the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, all spoke of the need for European independence, for giving substance to the EU treaty’sarticle 42.7, a pledge of mutual assistancein the event of attack and for a Europeanised Nato. As von der Leyen put it, the lines that have been crossed cannot be uncrossed. Russia’s war on Ukraine – which approaches its fourth anniversary – added a sense of urgency. So did the sober reminder from the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, that the US threat to Greenland has not gone away.While European resolve and collective action will most likely continue, the bulk of the energy will be devoted to working within existing transatlantic frameworks, especially Nato. This should indeed be a key strand of work. The fact that theUK and Italy are each taking over Nato commandsfrom the US signals an important step toward establishing aEuropean “pillar”within the defence alliance. The US will remain critical, providing command and control,specialised capabilitiesand, above all, the nuclear umbrella. Diplomats believe that at the end of this journey Nato will look very different, with the US representing an estimated fifth or less of its military capacity, down from just under half today.However, if the US is driven by an imperial vision in which its strategic interests diverge from Europe’s – if Washington no longer considers Vladimir Putin’s Russia a national security threat – should Europeans pin their security hopes exclusively on a Europeanised Nato?A European pillar within Nato is the most effective route to a secure Europe as the US scales back responsibility for the continent’s defence. It is certainly far more achievable than turning the EU into a military alliance or even defending Europe through formalised coalitions of the willing and able.But in practice, it cannot guarantee European security if the US pursues its current imperial trajectory. If Europeans were comforted by a false sense of reassurance as they walked away from the packed Bayerischer Hof hotel in Munich, they risk walking straight into the trap that Maga America has laid for them.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What is happening and why?The alarm comes from changes in the way taxpayers’ money is invested by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), which recentlypublished its planon how to disburse £38.6bn of public research and development funding over the next four years. Change is always unsettling, and as the UKRI’s chief executive, Ian Chapman, says, there will always be those wholose out when change happens. Difficult choices must be made.As an example, the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), one of UKRI’s subsidiary councils, announced thecancellation of several projectsit had been asked to take forward by the UKRI infrastructure fund. These include a nuclear physics collaboration with the US, a powerful microscopy facility at Daresbury and a major UK-led project at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as Cern.My own research in particle physics is funded via the STFC. So is research into astronomy and nuclear physics, as well as large UK multidisciplinary facilities. STFC also takes care of international subscriptions, ranging from our membership of Cern to telescopes, light sources and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. Those international projects carry important considerations around “science diplomacy”, or UK soft power, as well as being crucial to our national research capacity. A recent success in this area wasthe appointment of Mark Thomson, the first British director general of Cern since the 1990s, after a sustained campaign from this government and its predecessor. Given the difficulties in relations with our European partners post-Brexit, this was a very positive development.It is now marred by the fact thata letter announcing cutsto UK-Cern collaborations arrived as Thomson takes over – most definitely not good science diplomacy.Overall, Michele Dougherty, executive chair of the STFC, has said that UK investment in particle physics, astronomy and nuclear physicswill fall by 30%. This will be devastating to a tightly managed portfolio of projects that are essential to the success, probably even the survival, of several excellent physics departments around the country, as well as the careers of a generation of researchers. These areas are major attractors of students and international researchers into UK science and technology, and many studies have shown that they make huge contributions to the economy, often in unpredictable ways.It is through this portfolio that we reap the scientific and economic benefits of our membership ofCernand the large international astrophysics projects. Without proper investment in the UK, we can’t make best use of the membership fees we pay. In effect, we will be helping pay for these large-scale experiments around the world, but won’t fund enough UK scientists to analyse the data they produce.The justification for these changes stems from a positive recognition that investing in research drives economic growth. To this end, UKRI has defined “buckets”, or new categories of research, to better apportion funding. The House of Commons science, innovation and technology select committee in a recent session asked for a more inspiring name than “buckets”, but for now it stands.Bucket one is labelled “Curiosity-driven research”. Bucket two is “Strategic government and societal priorities” and bucket three is “Supporting innovative companies”. Bucket four, “Enabling and strengthening UK R&D”, is for investments that make substantial contributions across the other three, such as skills training and multidisciplinary facilities.This is at least a potentially reasonable way of allocating resources, and Chapman says that the changes are mainly about transparency and measuring outcomes,writing: “UKRI has always funded these three areas but has not been as clear as it needs to be on what goes where and what outcomes are expected.” But the devil is in the detail. What is the journey from a “curiosity-led” discovery through to something that addresses a societal priority and then maybe gets commercialised by an innovative company? And is the balance of resource – who gets what – shifting? Chapmantold the select committeethat last question couldn’t be answered, because the buckets are new.He seeks to reassure, saying that, despite pauses to several funding programmes, curiosity-led research (bucket one) will be protected, and researchers will be able to bid for support from the other buckets, too. Many in the research community are worried about this, but there at least some who are confident that the opportunities created will be significant. However, these reassurances are hard to square with the cuts at the STFC, much of which fall squarely on the category of curiosity-driven research.Difficult choices have to be made, but they have to be good choices or we risk profound long-term damage to our research ecosystem. And making a good choice requires an attention to detail that seems to have been lacking from UKRI so far. In answer to questions at his lecture to the Campaign for Science and Engineering on Tuesday, Chapman said that, regarding STFC cuts, “no decision has been made”, and that the impact would be evaluated before things were set in stone. This is a positive sign. There is still time to avoid a disaster, but it is running out.Jon Butterworth is professor of physics at University College London, and a member of the ATLAS Collaboration at CernExplore more on these topicsScienceOpinionCernPhysicsParticle physicscommentShareReuse this content"

And when I say “earns”, what I actually mean is “gets paid”. If David Guetta and Calvin Harris can makeup to $1mfor a festival-headlining set – a couple of hours’ work – there can only be one answer: DJs. Because boil it down and all they’re doing for such vast sums of money is quite competently playing music that somebody else actually created. They are proficient labourers rather than artists. In what other field is taking the credit for somebody else’s brilliance so venerated?Ah, but they get people dancing, you say. Yet how difficult is it to get people to dance when they have come out with the specific intention of dancing, and a reasonable proportion of them are on another planet? These people have invested heavily in having a good time, so it invariably becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Given the sheer number of floor-filling tunes made during the past six or seven decades, it’s hardly a great feat to choose a few that other people will tolerate or even like.To be clear: my disdain for DJs is not an exhumation of the racist and homophobic “disco sucks” campaign, or a tired reclamation of “real music” (whatever that is). I have nothing against clubs, clubbing, “repetitive beats”, revelry, dancing, music, people enjoying themselves, fun, humanity. And I should add that I respect and admire those who are so proselytising about their musical genre of choice that they put on their own club nights for the love of it, rather than as some self-aggrandising vanity project. I just find the totemic worship of “The DJ” really weird.View image in fullscreenParis Hilton DJing at SXSW in Austin, Texas, March 2022.Photograph: Rick Kern/Getty Images for The SandboxI think I at least understand where this need comes from. In the early 1990s, dance music was so often dismissed as “faceless techno bollocks” by a sneering music press that Rising High Recordsrepurposed the phrasefor a T-shirt. The cult of the DJ feels like a reaction against that sort of genre snobbery.The hill I will die on: Martinis should be served with a sidecar, or not at all | Josh SharpRead moreMore importantly, clubbing is a communal act; it’s all about coming together, and so it helps if there is some sort of human focal point. Whereas at gigs that focus is clearly the artist on stage, at a club … well, the people who created the art aren’t there, so the person working the record player gets the vicarious adulation. All the other people who, in their own small ways, make your evening special – the bar staff, the lighting engineer, the cab driver who takes you home – are eclipsed by the chancer taking the massive decision of whether to play I Feel Love or One More Time next. No wonder it goes to their heads.At the start of the 00s, I worked at a dance music magazine for a couple of years. Many of the regular contributors were DJs, presumably commissioned on the basis of “Hey, if they can successfully drop a needle on to a spinning record and be lauded for it, how hard can writing be for them?” I’ll spare you the answer to that. But I will just say that years of being surrounded by slack-jawed sycophants had left many of them with a disproportionate sense of their own brilliance.If anything, that distorted sense of their worth is even worse now than it was then. The number of celebs queueing up for their turn on the decks does rather suggest that it should be seen more as a glorified hobby than a proper job. Don’t try to tell me that the likes ofParis Hiltonor Gok Wan could transfer their “skillsets” to anything difficult. It’s proof, were it needed, that DJing is not a real job – it’s time to put the “dancy” back into “redundancy”.Phil Mongredien is joint production editor for Guardian Opinion and Long ReadsExplore more on these topicsClub cultureThe hill I will die onDance musicClubbingDavid GuettaCalvin HarrisParis HiltonGok WancommentShareReuse this content"

Not the left or the right – and not the centre any more. That’s why there’s been a nosedive in the pollsMon 16 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 05.16 ESTShareAfter a tumultuous few weeks, we are once again in “reset” territory. Keir Starmer has bought some more time, there is amodest bounce in his polling, and he has had the well-timed fortune of the Munich security conference. His call there for the“remaking” of western alliancesand taking the initiative on European defence cooperation has fumigated the air a little of the sense of imminent demise that has been swirling around him. But it will probably be a temporary hiatus. He is in a hole that is too deep to climb out of. The prime minister’s persistent unpopularity is best understood as the result of abundance: there is simply, in Starmer, something for everyone to deplore.In policy, he has taken stances that have established him in the minds of many people as devoid of principle and compassion. On Gaza, Starmer got it wrong from the start. From hisearly assertionthat Israel had the right to cut off water and power, torefusing calls for a ceasefireand then cracking down on protest (a move nowjudged as unlawfulby the high court), the prime minister positioned himself against a hugedomestic swell of distress. Add to that the cuts to disability benefits that made him appear callous after so many years of austerity, and what you have – whatever U-turns or watering down followed – is an impression of a politician whose instincts are those of a state apparatchik; someone whose default is enforcing pre-existing conventional wisdoms in foreign policy and economics, no matter how damaging or unpopular they are.Feeding into this is his feverish immigration rhetoric and policy. The “island of strangers” speech; the hectic posting and projection of imagery and footage ofcrackdown,arrestsanddeportations; the launch of measure after measure making life harder for those already working and living in the country legally; and for refugees, extending the qualifying timefor settlementandending family reunification. More positions that simply build on the immigration hysteria of the late Tory years and communicate that under Starmer, Labour is a continuity consensus party.And then there is Starmer himself. Personality alone does not make a politician, and God knows we have suffered enough from big personalities such as Boris Johnson – but you needsomething. Not necessarily fireworks and charm, but at the minimum just a sense of tangibility. Starmer is impalpable; not in the sense that he isn’t there, but that he is hiding.He doesn’t dream, he says, nor does he have phobias, nor favourite novels. He communicates in only the most generic terms, in staccato sentences using repetitive themes – “change” or his working-class roots – connected by meaningless “let me be clears” and “make no mistakes”.10:37Is Starmer out of the woods after Labour showdown? - The LatestThis manner summons all sorts of characters that overpopulate our corporatised lives – the middle manager, the jobsworth, the emissary from whatever head office. He has a way of somehow always communicating that sorry, he’s just doing his job – while holding the most powerful office in the country. Again, a state representative rather than a leader with volition and conviction.Who is this person’s constituency? Not the left, to which he has made clear in policy and in purges that this is not itsLabourparty. Not the right, which will never be at home in Labour, no matter how many people it deports or how much capital it courts. And not the centre any more, for which Starmer’s incompetence and lurching from one debacle to the next is becoming increasingly hard to rationalise.This is why there has been a nosedive in the polls, one that for past prime ministers would have been cushioned by whichever constituency they explicitly served: Brexiters, anti-immigration ultras, establishment free-marketeers, the working class. Who is out there banging the tables for “growth” and genocide?And then there is the obvious: two lords appointed to senior roles despiteassociations with sex offenders, and the disruption caused by the changing of personnel in the wake of related staff departures. The lack of judgment in these appointments is once more an indictment of Starmer’s tendency to defer to establishment names, networks and advisers who staff the senior ranks of a government that is a mash-up of zombie New Labour and austerity management inertia. If it’s broke, don’t fix it.The slow implosion of Keir Starmer’s government is the ultimate repudiation of ‘Labour minimalism’ | Andy BeckettRead moreBut Starmer’s problem is even bigger than that. Disliking him has become something wider: an expression of, once again, being thwarted and let down by politicians. He is feeling the impact of the country’s recent history of government instability, corruption and short premierships. The time he had to prove himself was always short, so violated was the country by the Brexit and pandemic years. Starmer was supposed to wipe the slate clean, not further sully it with his own record.More serious still is his failure in not having even the faintest ability to understand that the entire political establishment was on probation – and that he needed to break with the past in the most dramatic and surefooted ways in both policy and affect. The public is on high alert for cliquishness and chaos. The feelings of thosewho hate Starmerare sharpened by the fact that even he – finally a Labour leader who campaigned on being a decent, hardworking and upright person – could not deliver. There is no stronger feeling than one inspired by those you expected better from.All this doesn’t fit neatly with macro-concerns about paving the way for Reform with a sooner rather than later election, or the risks of plunging the country into another phase of economic and political instability by dumping yet another prime minister. But that doesn’t refute in any way the reasons for Starmer’s unpopularity. In a way, the prime minister is a manifestation of the dead end British politics finds itself in – either far-right populism, or Starmer’s all-at-once volatile, unintelligible and remote regime.

To me, he was simply everything. His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court. For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented. In doing so, he leaves something lasting and unforgettable to us all.”Duvall was perhaps best known for his role as the cavalry-hatted Kilgore inApocalypse Now, released in 1979, which yielded two of the most frequently quoted lines of dialogue in cinema history – “Charlie don’t surf!” and “I love the smell of napalm in the morning”. But he also made an immense impact as theconsigliereTom Hagen inThe GodfatherandThe Godfather Part II, the reclusive Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird at the start of his career, and many supporting and character roles throughout the ensuing decades. He was nominated seven times for an Oscar, winning once, for best actor in 1984 for Tender Mercies as a country-music singer trying to overcome alcoholism.Francis Ford Coppola, who directed Duvall inThe Godfatherfilms, The Rain People, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now, wrote on social media: “What a blow to learn of the loss of Robert Duvall. Such a great actor and such an essential part of [Coppola’s production company with George Lucas] American Zoetrope from its beginning.”Duvall’s Godfather co-star Al Pacino said it had been an honour to work with the actor. Pacino said: “He was a born actor as they say, his connection with it, his understanding and his phenomenal gift will always be remembered. I will miss him.”Robert De Niro, who played Duvall’s brother in the thriller True Confessions and also co-starred in The Godfather: Part II, wrote: “God bless Bobby. I hope I can live till I’m 95. May he rest in peace.”“The greatest consigliere the screen has ever seen,”​wrotethe actor Jamie Lee Curtis on social media, referring to Duvall’s role in the Godfather films as the Corleone family’s lawyer, Tom Hagen.​Adam Sandler, who acted alongside Duvall in Hustled (2022), ​​saidof Duvall: “Funny as hell. Strong as hell. One of the greatest actors we ever had. Such a great man to talk to and laugh with. Loved him so much. We all did. So many movies to choose from that were legendary. Watch them when you can.”Turner Classic Movies​paid tributeto the actor, saying “Duvall’s storytelling transcended mediums and generations of audiences” and the TCM host Ben Manckiewiczsaidit was “hard not to love everything about Robert Duvall’s work”.Born in San Diego, California, in 1931, the son of a naval officer, Duvall studied drama at college in St Louis, Missouri, and briefly joined the army. In 1955 he enrolled at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York (alongside James Caan, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman), sharing flats with Hackman and Hoffman. Duvall worked steadily in TV and theatre, including an award-winning role in a 1965 production of Arthur Miller’s A View from the Bridge, directed by Ulu Grosbard, and won his first film role as the mysterious Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird, released in 1962.View image in fullscreen‘Charlie don’t surf!’ … Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now.Photograph: Allstar/United ArtistsFurther small roles in Bullitt (1968) and True Grit (1969) consolidated his reputation, but it was his role inM*A*S*H– as the self-important Frank Burns, who is repeatedly mocked by Donald Sutherland’s Hawkeye and Elliott Gould’s Trapper John – that brought him to wider attention. Having appeared in Francis Ford Coppola’s feminist road movie The Rain People (1969), Duvall cemented his connection with the Hollywood new wave with the lead role in George Lucas’s 1970 debut feature, the dystopian sci-fi parable THX 1138; Tom Hagen in the first two Godfather films (he would ultimately not be cast in the third due to salary demands); and Kilgore in Apocalypse Now, in a role initially intended for Hackman.Duvall also continued to appear in more mainstream films, including the second world war thriller The Eagle Has Landed (1976), news-media satire Network (1976) and baseball drama The Natural (1984). He made his directorial debut in 1983 with Angelo My Love, a semi-improvised drama about a Romany street kid in New York. Despite his Oscar for Tender Mercies, lead roles rarely came his way, but he was a commanding supporting presence throughout the 80s and 90s, appearing in a wide range of films: the Dennis Hopper-directed gang thriller Colors, the Tom Cruise stock car blockbuster Days of Thunder (1990) and the Margaret Atwood adaptation The Handmaid’s Tale (1990).View image in fullscreenMulti-award-winning … Duvall, right, with Roshan Seth in the HBO’s Stalin.Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/NovofilmIn 1992, he returned to TV to play Stalin in an award-winning HBO filmdirected by Ivan Passer.

He received his third best actor Oscar nomination for the role.Duvall would direct two more films – Assassination Tango in 2002, in which he displayed his real-life talent for the Argentinian dance style, and the westernWild Horsesin 2015. He continued to appear in a wide variety of films, from Hollywood thrillers such asThe Gingerbread ManandGone in 60 Seconds, to left-field dramas such asWe Own the NightandThe Road. A longtime interest in football (the “association” kind) led to roles in the low-budget Scottish dramaA Shot at Glory(opposite Ally McCoist) in 2000, and the comedy Kicking and Screaming (2005) with Will Ferrell.View image in fullscreenThe consigliere … Duvall, right, with Al Pacino in The Godfather Part II.Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar/ParamountDuvall continued working steadily through the 2010s, achieving another Oscar nomination for best supporting actor in 2015 forThe Judge, becoming at the time the oldest male actor ever nominated.One of Hollywood’s most prominent Republican supporters for decades, Duvall said he gave up supporting the party in 2014.Duvall was married four times: to Barbara Benjamin (1964-81), to Gail Youngs (1982-86), to Sharon Brophy (1991-95) and to Luciana Pedraza, whom he married in 2005.

So what made him write a comedy about two men waiting?Mon 16 Feb 2026 10.33 ESTLast modified on Mon 16 Feb 2026 12.55 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleGary Wilmot has had many lives. A children’s TV presenter turned variety show host turned panto marvel turned musicals sensation, Wilmot has now turned his hand back to playwriting. His London debut is a comedy about two men, waiting. One is chill, the other restless; both become bonded by the wait. Very Samuel Beckett, isn’t it? The men could be Vladimir and Estragon, no?“Funny you should say that,” Wilmot says, sitting at Upstairs at the Gatehouse, the theatre above a pub in London that is staging While They Were Waiting, in which he also stars, opposite Steve Furst. Soon after the play was commissioned, he was asked if he had been influenced by Beckett’s existential play Waiting for Godot. He’d never seen it but it just so happened there was a production in the West End starring Ben Whishaw and Lucian Msamati. Wilmot went, saw it and left nonplussed. “I thought, ‘There’s a reason I’ve never seen this. I haven’t got a clue what’s going on.’”I remember as a six-year-old dancing around, wiggling my bum and miming to the song My Boy LollipopThat’s an admission not every actor would dare make. “Well, I am honest about things,” he says, and it’s true – Wilmot is full of refreshing candour that sounds like comic self-deprecation at times, perhaps with a calculation to disarm and entertain. Instantly likable, he is measured in tone and, aged 71, still bearing a kind of ageless bounce.“I sat in a workshop ofPaddington the Musicala few years ago,” he says, following up on the Beckett story. Does he mean the theatrical juggernaut currently in the West End? “Yes, it was being workshopped and I was playing [the equivalent of]Hugh Grant’s characterfrom the film. This character had been crowbarred in … so at the end of the workshop, when we were sitting chatting with the producers and director, I said: ‘I’m going to do myself out of a job here but why is my character in this? He’s just so disjointed from everything else.’”View image in fullscreenBonding experience … Wilmot and Steve Furst in rehearsals for While They Were Waiting.Photograph: Simon JacksonHe did indeed do himself out of a job, and that character vanished from the script. Wilmot has no regrets. It’s about entertainment, he says, not ego.That motto’s clearly worked for Wilmot, whose career has stretched across more than half a century. For a certain generation, he is a household name. A finalist in TV reality contest New Faces in the late 1970s, and the boundlessly energetic presenter of 80s children’s shows such as So You Want to Be Top?, he graduated to hosting his own variety series and became a staple on primetime TV for years. But younger generations, he points out with no hint of offence, have never heard of him.Still he has never been short of work, thanks to some canny repurposing of his skill-set. When TV variety hit obsolescence he went into musical theatre, excelling as the cockney gent Bill Snibson in Me and My Girl, and shining as Yale man Elisha J Whitney in the Olivier-winning Anything Goes, among others. There’s a tenacity to Wilmot that seems admirably old-school, a will to get out on the road, to push himself on, no matter what size the venue or audience. He has written two plays before now which were staged at his village hall in Tring in Hertfordshire, including one called Horse which, he explains, is about a man who thinks he’s a horse (I hold back on comparisons with Peter Shaffer’s Equus after the Beckett misfire). So a quiet king of reinvention, then, it would seem? No, he says, none of these gyrations have been premeditated. “I wasn’t ambitious until about 10 years ago,” he says, but he is a natural shapeshifter: “I’ve always been one for looking for new things.”He left school when he was 15, barely able to read and write. “It was comprehensive school education [in south London] which comprehensively failed me. I couldn’t wait to get out.” He didn’t think of showbusiness as a career for himself, even for a minute, but his friends did. “They thought I was funny, they decided to push me, one guy in particular. It’s funny how some people come into your life for a brief moment and affect it for ever. He said he’d met a theatrical agent. He gave me his business card and said, ‘I’ve told him you’re brilliant.’”View image in fullscreenWilmot with Sutton Foster and Felicity Kendal in the Cole Porter musical Anything Goes,Photograph: Ian West/PAWilmot was 21, working as a scaffolder and forklift driver. The agent put him in touch with an impressionist giving tuition to young performers. For £5 an hour, he learned the basics and began gigging. “I found something that everyone else thought I was good at, so I carried on doing it. But I think I knew from day one that it was a good feeling to make people laugh. I remember as a six-year-old dancing around, wiggling my bum and miming to My Boy Lollipop.”As someone who began his career on a TV talent show, he thinks the format back then was first and foremost about finding new talent. “Now it seems to me to be about maintaining the profile of the panellists rather than finding new talent that’s going to have longevity. If you ask someone who won X Factor last year they wouldn’t have a clue, but 10 years after [Wilmot’s professional partner] Judy and I won New Faces, people were saying ‘Oh, you’re the guy from New Faces.’”View image in fullscreen‘My friends thought I was funny and decided to push me’ … Wilmot doing standup on ITV’s Saturday Gang in 1986.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockAlthough he was given few leg-ups, Wilmot did have entertaining in his blood; his father was a professional singer in a group called the Southlanders. The song they were known for wasI Am a Mole and I Live in a Hole, says Wilmot, singing it in a baritone. “My dad was the bass voice.” Jamaican-born and raised, Harry Wilmot came to Britain on the Empire Windrush in 1948, and fell in love with Wilmot’s white British mother. They would have been a very visible anomaly as a mixed-raced couple in postwar Britain.“It’s only when I had kids of my own that I realised how difficult it must have been for her,” he reflects. “She was a dancer, and her dance partner was her brother. When my dad came along he disowned her, completely and utterly.” She died in 1978, just as Wilmot was on the brink of his TV breakthrough. “She didn’t see New Faces. It would have been nice for her to see it,” he says, and his understated tone is all the more moving.He speaks in the same tender tones about his father, who died when Wilmot was just seven. It sounds, from his stories, as if he has been searching for him in adult life. “One time, I was rehearsing a musical in south London and I’d seen posters for a Windrush exhibition at the Imperial War Museum.” He went along and saw footage of a BBC report from the deck of the Windrush, in which he recognised his father being interviewed. “I said to a stranger, ‘That’s my dad!’”View image in fullscreenThat’s my dad!’ … Harry Wilmot, centre, in a famous photograph showing men coming to Britain on the Empire Windrush.Photograph: Douglas Miller/Getty ImagesThen there is the famous Windrush photo that features his father: “It’s two guys standing and in the middle is a guy sitting on a crate. My dad’s the one in the middle. They are all very dapper. I met one of the guys recently at an exhibition at the British Library. He was in a wheelchair and I said, ‘You were in that photograph with my dad. What was he was like?’ He told me he didn’t know him. The photographer had said, ‘You, you and you, come here’, which is what photographers do.”Did Wilmot feel anger when the Windrush scandal broke? “No I just felt like everybody. Any sane person would have gone, ‘This guy’s 60, he’s been working in this country …”If 1960s Britain was hard on his mother, it wasn’t exactly easy for him or his brother either. “We were two Black boys in a predominantly white community with a white mother.” Then again, he says, there was a fierce sense of neighbourliness on his Lambeth estate. “Everyone in my block was [called] auntie or uncle. If I came home and my mum was at an appointment at the hospital, my aunt Lou next door would say, ‘Come and have some tea with me.’ That’s what you did.”He and his brother had a reunion about 25 years ago with all the boys they grew up with on the estate, and 54 men turned up, he says. “Not only did I know all 54 blokes, I knew their brothers and sisters, I knew their parents. We were in the banqueting room of a hotel and had a wonderful time. There was still this feeling of community, but of those 54 blokes, only one still lived on the estate. We were all encouraged to go out.”What about racism as a child? Whatever he got, he gave back tenfold, he answers. “If a guy had acne, or big ears, or was lanky or short and he had a go at me, I would give it back.” Maybe it’s how his humour developed, he thinks. But the first time he felt being Black affected him was when he started doing theatre in the 90s, “when the colour of your skin meant you couldn’t play certain roles”.View image in fullscreen‘I knew from day one it was a good feeling to make people laugh’ … playing the dame in Jack and the Beanstalk in 2014.Photograph: Jane Hobson/ShutterstockIt was pointed out to him, he says. “When I went into Me and My Girl, I was nobody’s idea of an archetypal cockney character from 1930s. But I was more like him than any of the guys who had played it before because I knew that character. I’m delighted to say they recognised that in me and gave me the role.”‘A split second of sheer terror – and we’re off’: Lucian Msamati on Waiting for Godot’s electrifying first nightRead moreNow things may have swung too much the other way, he feels. “If there are two actors auditioning for Martin Luther King and one of them looks like him, and when he reads the ‘I have a dream’ speech you think ‘strong contender’ … but then in comes a guy who is a much, much better actor. Just because the first guy is Black, doesn’t mean he understands what was going on with Martin Luther King and what America and the world were going through. So on comes the actor who really gets to the root of the character, and when he gives you that speech you think, ‘I never knew what that speech meant until he told me.’”But the white actor hasn’t had racial abuse shouted at him on the street. “No,” says Wilmot, “but he’s touched your emotion.” So the discourse on authenticity is misguided? “I do think there’s a certain amount of box-ticking going on, but in a funny way I’m quite pleased with that because it means Black and Brown performers get an opportunity to improve, to work with the best.“But the overriding point is that this isn’t the real world. It’s a made-up world and it’s up to us to get the audience to believe the lies we’re telling.”While They Were Waiting is at Upstairs at the Gatehouse, in London, from 26 February until 22 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsEntertainment TVinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It was my first film as director and I thought my career was over. It was during this downtime that I wrote A Knight’s Tale. I loved the idea that jousting tournaments were medieval sports, but I had never figured out what to do with it. I thought about the ideas underpinning it: a peasant who wants to be a noble was like a screenwriter wanting to be a director. It’s a guy trying to be something he has no right to be.The studio had a shortlist of actors for William/Sir Ulrich, at the top of which wasPaul Walker. I met him but he seemed too contemporary, like a guy who should be driving race cars – which he did so well in The Fast and the Furious. I just thought: “You’re not going to pull this off.” Heath Ledger was a rising star at the time. I met him at a restaurant in LAX airport and he had this long leather case with him. “What’s in the case?” I asked. He said: “It’s my didgeridoo.” “Can you play it?” I asked. He said: “Of course I can.” And he started blowing on it like a white Australian Miles Davis. Everyone was looking. I fell in love with him in that moment and offered him the part.The only thing more embarrassing than walking down the street naked is doing it with a sock on your penisI wrote the part of Chaucer forPaul Bettany, although Sony wanted Hugh Grant. I’ve got nothing against Hugh but I thought the tone would be skewed if it was him and three other guys. The movie has since been written about by Chaucer scholars – they love it.We jousted for real with re-enactors from a Las Vegas jousting show. But we made the lances of balsa wood so they wouldn’t kill anybody. The art department made compartments in them and put uncooked spaghetti in: when the lances broke, they exploded and the pasta went up in the air looking like splinters. We put the Nike logo on Sir Ulrich’s armour as a joke. Years later, someone at Nike told me how much they loved it. I thought: “We could’ve got so many free sneakers!”View image in fullscreen‘He got a tattoo mid-shoot’ … Heath Ledger and Brian Helgeland on location.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyHeath got pretty bashed up. He’d proudly lift his shirt and there’d be huge abrasions. After the movie came out, we were demonstrating how to joust to his agent. He had a broom and I had a mic stand: he hit me in the mouth by accident and knocked my tooth out.It got reviewed badly. Someone criticised the score – not the modern songs but the score itself, because it has electric guitar. I said: “Should it have violins and french horns? Because they didn’t exist in 1370 either.”Heath said A Knight’s Tale was like a photo album of how much fun he had making it. It’s about fighting the power – and that speaks to today very well.Paul Bettany, played ChaucerI auditioned and the studio said: “We don’t get him.” Brian flew me out for another audition and they still didn’t get it. Finally he said: “If you don’t cast him, I’m not making the movie.” And because they had Heath attached, who was the hottest thing going after10 Things I Hate About You, they went: “All right, we’ll let Brian have Paul in this fucking movie.”So Brian started my Hollywood career. He was like a shining knight. I knew exactly what it was like to be an unrecognised artist. I used to have a philosophy for whenever I was nervous before an audition. I’d think: “All you have to do is fake confidence for 15 minutes.” That was the basis of Chaucer for me: fake it till you make it.There are lots of jokes in Chaucer’s first speech but we were in Prague and the extras didn’t speak English, so they just stared at me. We drew up these massive cards that said “Applaud” or “Laugh” in Czech. I came away thinking I’d really killed it when they laughed. I was amazed at my own shallowness.View image in fullscreen‘Hey, naked guy!’ … Ledger and Bettany as William and Chaucer.Photograph: Egon Endrenyi/API was very nervous about thenaked scenes. Before we shot, the costume team knocked on my trailer with a sock on a hanger. I asked: “What’s this for?” They said: “To put on your junk in case you’re embarrassed.” I said: “The only thing more embarrassing than walking down the street naked is doing it with a sock on your penis.” Mercifully, it was a warm day. After all the roles I’ve played, which includes Vision for Marvel, I mostly get “Hey, naked guy!” shouted at me in the street.Heath got a tattoo mid-shoot. It was a tiny circle with a circle around it and then a bigger circle around that, like a target. He said: “That’s me in the middle. That circle is the Earth, and the other circle is the universe.” I said: “You’ve put yourself right in the middle? I’ve never been that confident!” But he was that confident in the most joyful, winning way.So much has been said about Heath and darkness, but the moment you saw him, he just radiated light, happiness and joy. He was a ball of creativity and charisma, so very alive that even today it’s difficult to imagine him dead. I often find myself wondering what beautiful things he would have made.A Knight’s Tale is a film about a boy from nowhere who changes his stars and I love that. It’s full of positive messaging. It was a magical time.A 25th anniversary 4K restoration of A Knight’s Tale opens in UK cinemas on 20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmHow we madeHeath LedgerMusicalsPaul BettanyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 1963, it hosted the founding meeting of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the precursor to today’s African Union. Africa was then emerging from centuries of colonial rule, and many of the OAU’s founders – including Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah and Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt – had led their nations to independence.“Only a few years ago,” the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie said at the time, “meetings to consider African problems were held outside Africa, and the fate of its peoples were decided by non-Africans. Today … the peoples of Africa can, at long last, deliberate on their own problems and future.”Mezzedimi’s design emanated a spirit of optimism, embodying functional clarity and spatial openness, sitting in a garden landscape with expansive views over Addis Ababa. Organised around a horseshoe-shaped plenary hall crowned by a vast rotunda, its interior incorporated Carrara marble, Ethiopian stone and Mezzedimi’s elegant, custom-designed furniture. Artworks included a 40-metre mural illustrating the richness of African flora, by Italian painter Nenne Sanguineti Poggi, and a stunning triptych of monumental stained glass windows by Ethiopian artist Afewerk Tekle.View image in fullscreenAfewerk Tekle’s monumental triptych, Total Liberation of Africa, created in 1961.Photograph: Rory GardinerThis foundational site of modern African political history was commissioned by Selassie, then eager to implement an ambitious unifying vision for the continent and his country. Ethiopia remains the only African country never fully colonised by a European power. Along with Addis Ababa’s city hall, also designed by Mezzedimi – who completed more than 100 buildings across the Horn of Africa – it was one of two statement projects intended to demonstrate, in Selassie’s words, “that it is possible to construct grand buildings here too [in Ethiopia]”.Over the decades, however, like many structures of its era, Africa Hall fell into decline and disrepair. After a £42m, decade-long programme of restoration, completed in 2024, the rejuvenated building is once again emblematic of pan-African progress, renewed as an important venue for diplomacy and cultural exchange.Africa Hall is still making history. The restoration project has just been awarded the World Monuments Fund/Knoll Modernism prize, the most prestigious accolade in the often underappreciated field of conserving modernist heritage. It’s the first time a building in Africa has been honoured since the biennial prize was inaugurated in 2008 – previous winners include a concrete villa in Argentina, a French school dedicated to Karl Marx and the restoration of Preston bus station (designed in 1968 by Building Design Partnership, working with the Danish engineer Ove Arup).View image in fullscreenAfrica Hall’s plenary hall, post-renovation, in 2024.Photograph: Rory Gardiner“Modern architecture captures some of the most ambitious ideas of the 20th century, but its innovations also render these buildings vulnerable to the passage of time,” said Bénédicte de Montlaur, president and CEO of the World Monuments Fund. “The prize was created to call attention to these challenges and highlight exemplary preservation efforts around the world.”The architectural team from Brisbane-based Architectus Conrad Gargett conducted exhaustive research into all aspects of Mezzedimi’s original design. The entire facade was reglazed to improve the building’s energy efficiency and structural integrity, while the surrounding landscape was replanted with native African flora, and its splendid terraced fountains cleaned and refreshed.Mosaic tiles on the exterior had to be removed to address structural degradation, so 13 million new ones were fabricated, replicating the mosaics’ textured profile and colour schemes. More than 500 pieces of Mezzedimi’s distinctive furniture were restored and reinstated. The project also addressed seismic resilience, as earthquakes and volcanic activity are common in Ethiopia, and introduced new technology in ways that respect the building’s modernist character.At the heart of Africa Hall is Afewerk Tekle’s 1961 work, Total Liberation of Africa – a sumptuous stained glass triptych depicting scenes from the continent’s history. Rich in colour and allusion, it became a photogenic backdrop for visiting dignitaries to Ethiopia, including Britain’s late Queen Elizabeth II in 1965. Tekle had previously studied at London’s Slade School of Art, and travelled around Europe for two years, learning how to design and construct stained glass windows.View image in fullscreenAfrica Hall in 1966.Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Mondadori/Getty ImagesThe stained glass pieces were originally fabricated by the French artisan studio Atelier Thomas Vitraux; Emmanuel Thomas, the grandson of the original maker, was enlisted to help restore the panels. The thread of artistic connection from Africa Hall is further strengthened by Ethiopian American contemporary artist Julie Mehretu, who has drawn on Tekle’s work for her own monumental stained glass project at the Obama Presidential Centre, due to open later this year in Chicago.“Africa Hall stands as one of the most important expressions of modern architecture on the continent, a building that brought together international ideas and local identity at a pivotal moment in the region’s history of decolonisation,” said Barry Bergdoll, the American architectural historian and curator who chaired the prize jury.“[Its] restoration has allowed the clarity of Mezzedimi’s design to speak again, revealing the ambition, craftsmanship and symbolic power that have made the building a landmark of modernism and a continuing stage for African diplomacy.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureEthiopiaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

A lone female English voice appears to accompany her, high and pure against the buzzing drone of a harmonium, singing about a woman roaming alone, and a man who, for “seven years, left the land”, before his eventual return.Long before Emerald Fennell found Olivia Chaney’s version of 19th-century ballad the Dark Eyed Sailor online, Chaney was preparing to sing it for a 2013 live session on Mark Radcliffe’s BBC Radio 2 folk show, in the midst of her own Brontë-esque love triangle. “I was at the beginning of my relationship with the man who is now my husband and the father of my two children – he nearly married someone else, and I nearly had kids with someone else.”She recounts this from her Yorkshire living room, minutes after getting home from the nursery run. “So to see this song first pop up to support Cathy’s emotions around her being with the wrong man … it was very spooky.”Fennell told Chaney she was choosing between three of her songs for the film. She settled on this one “because she connected with it”, says Chaney. “There’s something about the way she uses my voice, not surrounded by [an] orchestra at all, that shows how raw and emotional I felt.”Olivia Chaney: Dark Eyed Sailor – videoThe song’s rescue from the vaults came at a serendipitous time for Chaney, a wide-ranging artist recently returning to folk. Her previous three albums, mainly of originals, include 2024’s Circus of Desire; its title track was remixed by Vessel, and Chaney’s dancing in the video recalled the two years she spent singing live with Zero 7. On 27 February, she plays her first gig with her new British folk-rock band, News From Nowhere, which has quite the lineup: Tom Skinner, the drummer from the Smile and Sons of Kemet (“one of my favourite musicians on earth”), Owen Spafford on violin and electronics, singer-songwriter Clara Mann, and composer/producer Leo Abrahams, with whom Chaney recorded her debut EP the same year as that fateful Mark Radcliffe session.Chaney discovered folk music as a path for herself in her 20s. She knew some folk-rock and singer-songwriters from her parents’ record collection, but she sang Hildegard of Bingen’s music with the Oxford Girls’ Choir, and won a scholarship to Chetham’s School of Music at 14 to study voice and piano, going on to study jazz at the Royal Academy of Music in London in 2000.Seven years later, after being stood up on a date – “a bit blue, really in my own world, and not knowing where to go with my singing” – she went to an afterparty with friends at London’s Southbank Centre. “And I saw this really shy busker playing this heavenly music. I ran over, begging, ‘What are you playing? Who are you like? Do you want to work together?’” The busker, Matthew Ord, now a lecturer in folk music at Newcastle university, was playing Planxty Irwin, a tune by the 17th-century Irish composer and blind harpist Turlough O’Carolan.Ord taught Chaney many traditional songs, including Dark Eyed Sailor: “I really responded to the words and the emotions in it,” she says. Then, one day, he turned up at her house with a harmonium and asked if she wanted to play it. “And that was that.”View image in fullscreenOlivia Chaney performing in London.Photograph: Monika S. JakubowskaChaney became one of Britain’s most exciting new folk performers, earning the respect of veteran folk artists. She supported Shirley Collins on her 2017 tour, sang with Richard Thompson at his 70th birthday concert at the Royal Albert Hall and performed at last year’s all-star tribute gig to Martin Carthy in Hackney. She also fronted folk-rock supergroup Offa Rex with the Decemberists; their brilliant 2017 album, Queen of Hearts, was nominated for a Grammy.This summer, she’s also releasing an album of songs by composer Henry Purcell and performing them with a chamber ensemble at the London venue Kings Place, where she’s an artist in residence this year. “Purcell wrote for kings and queens, but he was also down the pub listening to the ballads and the broadsides,” says Chaney. “His ability to write a catchy tune, almost like a pop hook, made his songs go straight back into the street culture of the day. I’m so interested in those connections.”Charli xcx: Wuthering Heights review – atonal, amorous anthems that more than stand apart from the filmRead moreThat cross-cultural mindset is typical of Chaney’s outlook. The only other voice heard singing inWuthering Heightsis that of Charli xcx, who produced a companion album to the record. “I think her music’s great and very harmonious with my song – it all ties in really well together,” says Chaney. “Even though there are some bangers, harmonically they are in a similar world to Dark Eyed Sailor. There’s even synths and sounds that are in a similar sonic tonal world to my harmonium.”For years, Chaney’s version of Dark Eyed Sailor only existed in live YouTube clips, but she finally released a recorded version last Friday, produced by Oli Deakin (mastermind of CMAT’s albums If My Wife New I’d Be Dead and Euro-Country). She’d recorded “many” versions of it before – three were even mastered for albums, but “never quite fit”. She finally heard it fit at the Wuthering Heights premiere in Leicester Square on 5 February.What was the evening like? “Drinking champagne behind Richard E Grant?” She laughs. “Insane. I gripped my husband’s hand so tight when the song came in – hearing my voice all alone – that it reminded me of giving birth, gripping my doula’s hand so hard I nearly broke her knuckles!”The song appears again when Heathcliff returns to Cathy, now rich and grown up, and in the film’s final, longing minutes. It’s always been Chaney’s husband’s favourite recording, she adds. “It’s a song I love very much. It comes back and haunts you.”Olivia Chaney’sresidency at Kings Placestarts on 27 February.Explore more on these topicsMusicFolk musicWuthering HeightsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Let’s start with the easy bit: Victoria Derbyshire is the ideal interlocutor. The co-presenter of Newsnight has a kind of steely warmth that meshes well with the innate dignity of Mme Pelicot – as she is called throughout – while they walk unflinchingly through her terrible story.Her “descent into hell” began on 2 November 2020 when the local police called her and her husband, Dominique Pelicot, to the station. They believed it was to do with his recent arrest for covertly taking pictures underneath the skirts of three women in the supermarket. It was not. In the course of that investigation they had found on his laptop thousands upon thousands of videos and photographs accumulated over a decade of his wife unconscious and being raped by strangers.They showed Mme Pelicot a handful of images. She barely recognised herself, dressed in underwear she didn’t own, and she didn’t recognise the men. “Something exploded inside me,” she tells Derbyshire. She didn’t put a name to what she had seen until many hours later, when she was at home and told a friend: “Dominique raped me and had me raped.” He had her raped by at least 70 men. They were drawn – notes Derbyshire in a piece to camera at the top of the programme, as the names of the convicted fill the screen – from within a 30-mile radius of their home in Mazan, the tiny, beautiful little Provencal town to which they had retired some years before. Fifty-two – plus Mme Pelicot’s husband – were identified by the police, and after a three-month trial most were convicted of aggravated rape, two of sexual assault and two of attempted rape. Dominique received the maximum sentence of 20 years.View image in fullscreenGisèle Pelicot and Newsnight’s Victoria Derbyshire.Photograph: BBCDerbyshire’s questioning is not blunt, but it is straightforward. It would be an insult to Mme Pelicot and her proven ability to survive unthinkable traumas to be anything else. She famously waived her right to anonymity on the grounds that “shame must change sides”; it belongs not to the rape victim but to the rapists. It is usually said that she has become a feminist icon as a result, but really it is more specific than that. She has become a repository of hope and – though it has become a devalued word in the age of Instagram – an inspiration to all women across the globe, including rape victims who have not (yet) brought charges, or who belong tothe estimated 30% of the female populationwho have experienced physical and/or sexual violence, overwhelmingly at male hands (in March 2025,the ONS said that 98% of victims stated that their attacker was male).It is, perhaps counterintuitively, good to hear Mme Pelicot tell Derbyshire how her reactions and her thinking evolved regarding the question of anonymity. Initially, she wanted the usual closed hearing. “I certainly didn’t want to be seen,” she says, feeling that “the filthy stain stays with you for life”. But the four years “I carried that shame” between the discovery of her abuse and the trial gave her time to think and come to the conclusion that such “self-inflicted pain … meant that victims were being punished twice. And I thought that if I could overcome it, all victims could do it too. I’m sure of it. They must not lose confidence.”Caroline Darian, daughter of Gisèle Pelicot, speaks: ‘How can you rebuild when your father is the worst sexual predator in decades?’Read moreSitting, perfectly calm, effortlessly poised, even when occasionally moved to tears, even when explaining how and why her husband had to mix muscle relaxants in with the sedatives he gave her so that she would “slacken and dilate” enough not to be in pain the next day from what the men did to her unconsenting body (and realise something was wrong), Mme Pelicot cuts an extraordinary figure. You can only gaze in admiration at her strength and grace, and hope beyond measure that she can sustain the rapprochement with her daughter, Caroline – another suspected victim of Dominique, who is also under investigation for the attempted rape of a woman in 1999 (which he has admitted) and the murder of another in 1991, which he denies.But behind every examination of the Pelicot case a question lurks. How many people out there are reading or watching or listening not in abject horror but in thrall? How many men are out there thinking: “I wish, I wish …” or “I could, I could …”? Is that a morbid or a realistic question to be asking? Last month former Tory councillor Philip Young pleaded guilty to nearly 50 counts of drugging, raping and sexually assaulting his former wife, Joanne, who has also waived her anonymity. Another man has pleaded guilty to raping her, too. It’s hard not to think of the 30-mile radius around you and wonder.Gisèle Pelicot: The Newsnight Interview aired on BBC Two and is available on iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewGisèle PelicotreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is the unenviable situation for Lily, the protagonist of O’Farrell’s second novel, who is swept off her feet by dashing architect Marcus and in short order moves in with him. Lily takes his assurances that her predecessor Sinead is “no longer with us” to mark a more permanent absence; in fact, Sinead has simply been thrown over, and it is in the details of the collapse of her relationship with Marcus that the novel most engages. Hints of the gothic ghost story deepen one of the main takeaways, which is that Marcus consists almost entirely of red flags.View image in fullscreen9The Distance Between Us (2004)Heritage and belonging drive much of O’Farrell’s fiction, and the gradual release of information to her readers often propels her narratives. She’s also interested in journeys both literal and figurative, and begins this novel in Hong Kong, where celebrations to mark the Chinese New Year are disrupted by sudden, dangerous mayhem. Meanwhile, a woman on a bridge in London glimpses a familiar face and takes this as her cue to leave the country. These dramatic events make little initial sense, but it’s the contrast between the immediate isolation of the characters and their complex and densely populated backgrounds that draws us in.View image in fullscreen8The Hand That First Held Mine(2010)O’Farrell repeatedly returns to the territory of new motherhood, and to how it intersects with the trauma of previous generations, and here she sets up two mirroring storylines. At the novel’s start we are introduced to Elina, an artist in contemporary London, who is navigating the aftermath of the birth of her first child, and to Lexie, who arrives in the capital in the 1950s from small-town England and almost immediately finds herself capsized by a transgressive love affair. What links them will unfold, but it’s the portrait of life before and after giving birth – characterised by a reconfiguring of identity – that holds the reader’s attention.View image in fullscreen7After You’d Gone (2000)O’Farrell’s debut novel won a Betty Trask award, and it’s easy to see why the judges thought this was a writer with promise. Most striking is its ambition: the central character, Alice, lies in a coma, which the reader gathers follows an unnamed but cataclysmic event. Mysterious, too, is the sudden realisation that struck Alice in a public lavatory in a train station on the day after her accident – a strand of the narrative that takes us back into her childhood and the obscured life of her difficult, thwarted mother. Additional plotlines unfurl a love story imperilled by religious and cultural collisions, displaying O’Farrell’s interest in exploring taboos and their long effects.View image in fullscreen6Instructions for a Heatwave (2013)Those too young to remember the cracked riverbeds and communal water pumps of Britain’s 1976 heatwave will enjoy the period detail of O’Farrell’s sixth novel, which forms the backdrop of a compulsively readable missing person mystery. The absentee in question is Robert Riordan, a newly retired Irish Londoner who goes out for a newspaper one morning and fails to return. Summoned home to support their mother, Gretta, Robert’s three adult children find themselves uncomfortably cheek by jowl, and it’s watching the family dynamics play tensely out in this moment of apparent crisis that provides most of the novel’s deliciously depicted drama.View image in fullscreen5The Marriage Portrait (2022)A chilling episode in Renaissance matrimonial history and a celebrated Victorian poem form the basis of O’Farrell’s most recent novel, which reimagines the fate of Lucrezia de’ Medici, child bride of the Duke of Ferrara. Lucrezia’s death in 1561, possibly by poisoning, inspired Robert Browning’s My Last Duchess, which leaves its readers in little doubt that her husband was an unrepentant murderer. O’Farrell’s purpose, in recreating the events at Ferrara’s court and their later representation, is to allow us to consider the ease with which women and girls were shuffled between dynastic families and opulent courts – and to wonder what might have happened had they ever been permitted a whisper of agency.View image in fullscreen4This Must Be the Place (2016)There’s something of the jeu d’esprit about this story of the whereabouts of Claudette Wells, a mercurial film star who has called time on her career and hunkered down in the wilds of Donegal. That O’Farrell tells her story through multiple narrators, hopping between settings and time periods, increases the suspicion that the author was intent on creating a kaleidoscopic effect, in which the overall picture is constantly shattering and re-forming. But a central story still emerges, and it is Daniel, Claudette’s linguist husband, who is left to try and put all the pieces together – and to determine whether or not the couple’s marriage can endure.View image in fullscreen3The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox (2006)Years beforeHamnet, O’Farrell made a partial foray into historical fiction to captivating effect: this split time-frame novel of family secrets remains one of her most admired works. In the present day, Iris attempts to fathom the fate of her great-aunt Esme, who disappeared from record as a young woman in Edinburgh; she could ask her grandmother Kitty, Esme’s sister, if Kitty’s grasp on reality hadn’t been unmoored by Alzheimer’s disease. The picture that emerges from Iris’s stalwart research is a disturbing one: Esme hasn’t taken flight, but was in fact committed to a psychiatric unit 60 years previously for entirely dubious and non-psychiatric reasons.View image in fullscreen2I Am, I Am, I Am: Seventeen Brushes With Death (2017)Some of the encounters detailed in this gripping memoir may seem closer than others to bringing the author’s life to a premature end: the childhood contraction of encephalitis, which left her with permanent neurological issues, is more profoundly altering than the terror she felt as a guinea pig for a stage knife-thrower. But each of these experiences sharpened O’Farrell’s understanding of the precarity and strangeness of human mortality, and they are recounted with a kind of astonishment at her own survival. Most serious and moving of all is the book’s final essay, an account of her daughter’s daily battle with a life-threatening immunological condition, which transforms the world into a landscape of potentially catastrophic threats.View image in fullscreen1Hamnet (2020)Even before Chloé Zhao, Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal brought Hamnet to a screen near you, O’Farrell’s eighth novel was a huge success story, winning the Women’s prize for fiction and expanding her already significant readership. There was the premise, of course: fictionalising the death of William Shakespeare’s 11-year-old son Hamnet in 1596 was an eye-catchingly bold move, but O’Farrell then de-centred the playwright, focusing instead on his wife, Agnes, and setting the novel not in London but in Stratford-upon-Avon. It is there that her act of imaginative reclamation takes place, as we see Agnes – not, as she became, the sidelined Anne Hathaway of history – as a practised and skilful herbalist, and follow her into the agonising throes of grief.To browse all titles by Maggie O’Farrell, visitguardianbookshop.com.

Chinese artistYin Xiuzhenmourns by preserving, stitching, sewing. Working in 1990s Beijing, she saw a city transforming so fast, and casting off its history with so little ceremony, that she had to save it somehow. Her show at the Hayward is full of scraps of the past, piled up, splayed out and knitted together in a desperate attempt to slow the onslaught of modernisation.Obviously, it didn’t work, Beijing is as modernised as cities come, but the works within her show, Heart to Heart, are a knowingly futile gesture. A little wooden trunk, built by the artist’s father, is filled with a neat stack of her old clothes, all encased in concrete. The soft warmth of her personal past preserved in the cold brutality of composite, the material irrevocably transforming her city and her life. Nearby, traditional roof tiles are scattered on the floor around an old Chinese cupboard, all covered in a thick, filthy layer of cement powder. Everywhere you look, the past is being buried to make way for the future.A minivan in the middle of the room has been extended, its body lengthened into a stitched-together concertina of recycled clothes. She is trying, over and over, to maintain some kind of link to humanity, to the past, in the face of unstoppable change and evolution.View image in fullscreen‘A tourist-trap model village made of rags’ … Yin Xiuzhen’s Portable City: London, 2026.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockThe futility of it all is obvious and makes these early works feel tangibly sad. Photos of an early installation show big blocks of ice made from polluted river water being symbolically scrubbed by passersby on the riverbank. “We cannot stop the physical impact of pollution on a small scale,” she says in a quote on the wall, “but we can create moments of collective reflection.”This early work is deeply felt and moving. Which you can’t really say for the more recent stuff here. She encases books in old fabric; she makes models of cities out of old clothes and packs them into suitcases. There’s a whole luggage carousel built into the gallery and a jumbo jet made out of tatty T-shirts hanging from the ceiling. The whole thing looks tacky, like a tourist-trap model village made of rags, a charity shop version of Legoland and, worst of all, it’s barely saying anything.Ideas of commerce, global trade and their exploitative capitalistic tendencies are written into the material she uses – that’s the narrative baked into the fabric of recycled textiles. But there’s no criticism, no depth, no point to its use in these works. Here’s some old T-shirts turned into Big Ben. Ta-dah.The main installation here is a giant human heart – yes, made of old T-shirts – intended as a space for, and I quote, “deep and meaningful conversations”. You have to create your own meaning here, because the artist can’t really be bothered.View image in fullscreenEverything and nothing … Chiharu Shiota’s Letters of Thanks, 2026.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockUpstairs, another exhibition – dubbed Threads of Life – finds Japanese artistChiharu Shiotaweaving endless webs of red and black thread. Shiota’s work has been a social media phenomenon in recent years, and the Hayward is obviously hoping that her dizzying, knotty installations will get the punters in.The first room is a tangled nightmare of crimson lines dangling with keys. We’re all connected, but how do we unlock those connections? Got it. The second room is filled with emotional letters of thanks, stapled to red threads hanging from the ceiling. Literally tugging on heart strings. Got it. Red string gets swapped for black in the final space, all woven around beds, like the Hayward has opened the world’s dirtiest, gothiest, spideriest hotel.The whole thing’s about blood and death and life and how we’re all connected, sure. But it’s so superficial that it’s totally meaningless, so on the nose it gives you a nosebleed. It’s so about everything, it’s essentially about nothing.But, and this is crucial, it will look good on your social media feed. Art institutions are in a tough bind – ha, like with threads! Either they put on interesting, clever, powerful art that no one comes to see, or they bow to the pressure of hosting pretty, vacuous immersive installations that will look good onInstagramin the desperate hope of selling some tickets. Damned if they do, ’grammed if they don’t.Realistically, this isn’t aimed at anyone who wants a genuine encounter with art; it’s aimed at people who want to take selfies in galleries. I hope it works for them, because otherwise it’s a real waste of thread.Yin Xiuzhen: Heart to Heart and Chiharu Shiota: Threads of Life are atHayward Gallery, London, until 3 May.Explore more on these topicsArtInstagramSouthbank CentrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Saltzman’s role involved curation of the artistic programme at the centre and community engagement, and in the last 18 months she had become its public face, laying out her vision in several interviews.‘Like lipstick on a fabulous gorilla’: the Barbican’s many gaudy glow-ups and the one to top them allRead moreShe was vocal about the need for London’s cultural institutions to have leadership reflecting the diverse city they inhabit. “We are actually in a new wave of next-generation leadership that hopefully is going to shift the model,” she said in 2024.The organisation has had several changes over the past five years. In 2021, Nicholas Kenyon resigned after 14 years as managing director after staff told the Guardian that the Barbican was “institutionally racist”. He was followed by the former BBC arts correspondent Will Gompertz, who left to join Sir John Soane’s Museum afterbeing in the job for only two years.Saltzman was one ofseven senior leadersinstalled after the Barbican replaced the managing director model. They all report to the chief executive, Abigail Pogson, who started last month.Saltzman joined during a row caused by the Barbicanbacking outof hosting a talk by Pankaj Mishra about the Holocaust and allegations that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. The decision resulted in several artists pulling their work out of an exhibition at the venue.One of her first acts was to speak to Mishra, and she has been seen as a figure who helped repair trust between the organisation and sections of the artistic community.Pogson, who joined from the Glasshouse International Centre for Music in Gateshead, is overseeing the first major renewal work in the venue’s history, involving a 12-month closure of its theatre, music venue and galleriesfrom June 2028. The first phase of the project will cost £231m and the overall bill is estimated to be £451m.Opened in 1982, the Barbican arts centre is a unique cultural institution. The centre’s cultural offering was originally designed primarily for the4,000 residents of the flatsset around the site. Today, more than 1.5 million people visit annually, making it one of themost popular cultural attractionsin the UK.Explore more on these topicsBarbicanLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

At the end of the last act, the year’s chosen victim, a far-right party functionary, delivers a 15-minute monologue laying out a nightmarish extremist agenda.As the actor Ole Lagerpusch launched into the incendiary speech, the audience became increasingly agitated, the theatre spokesperson Alexander Kruse said. At first, people began whistling and heckling, insulting Lagerpusch and urging him to stop. An orange was thrown at the actor, narrowly missing him.Kruse said some of the audience then got out of their seats. “Furthermore, two spectators mounted the stage, apparently with the intention of dragging [the] actor off the stage, which was prevented,” he said, calling the assault “completely unacceptable”.Martin Krumbholz of the culture website Nachtkritik.de, who was at the Bochum Schauspielhaus to review the play, said Lagerpuschpersevered despite the hostile reactionand managed to deliver his chilling last line: “The future belongs to us.”View image in fullscreenTwo spectators mounted the stage as Ole Lagerpusch’s far-right character delivered a monologue.Photograph: Armin SmailovicThe play’s acclaimed Slovenian director, Mateja Koležnik, said by telephone from Ljubljana that she was “incredibly proud” of Lagerpusch and denounced the “stupidity” and brutality of the spectators’ attack. “For me it was quite a shock – we did expect people talking back, even shouting back, because, of course, the last monologue is a provocation,” she said.She said Lagerpusch, who she described as “traumatised”, was so effective in the role because he was softly spoken, even affable, in conveying his hateful, divisive message. “[But] I was astonished by the stupidity, really. I never ever thought – nobody did – that somebody from the audience would jump on stage and try to hit the actor … I would expect this from the people we are voting against, but not from the people who should be on our side.”Koležnik said her intention with the production had not been to make “liberal, petit bourgeois society inEuropefeel good” around a consensus of condemning intolerance, but to leave them scared. “The next wave of fascism, there will not be monsters. There will be normal, nice people,” she said.The critic Christoph Ohrem of the regional public broadcaster WDR attended the premiere and releaseda brief audio recordingof the tumult, which he said recalled something from the age of Shakespeare.He noted Rodrigues’s piece had often triggered intense responses from audiences and concluded it was a “good play” for taking spectators out of their comfort zone. “It’s truly astonishing that a play can still elicit such reactions in 2026,” he said. Rodrigues has said heintended to cause a stirwith the play.In his review, Krumbholz placed the blame for the uproar on spectators. “Parts of the Bochum audience, which one would have thought to be among the most theatre-savvy in the country, are apparently too stupid, to put it bluntly, to distinguish between fiction and reality,” he said.People expressed support for the theatre in Bochum onits Instagram page, with one commenter noting that a subsequent performance withstepped-up security measures, and after an appeal for calm by the deputy director Angela Obst, had gone off without incident.Another spectator said of Saturday’s debacle that she had been “shocked how disrespectful some people can be in the theatre” when “the actor was just doing his job”.A third called it “scary” when “supposedly anti-fascist theatregoers storm the stage and attack the actors. This is basically a fascist attitude towards art and theatre and, in my opinion, should never happen.”Rodrigues’s play has won several awards including best foreign performance at Italy’s Ubu awards and the equivalent prize from the French Critics’ Union.Explore more on these topicsGermanyTheatreEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

If this does not raise sufficient savings, compulsory redundancies are possible.“Due to many widely reported circumstances which are beyond our control, such as rises in operational costs and commercial pressures, we have now reached a point where we must make difficult and painful decisions,” a spokesperson for the gallery said. “To achieve sustainability, we must balance our artistic and educational mission with a new operating structure.”There had been little indication of the gallery’s growing deficit after last year’s financial results received a major boost from its Van Gogh exhibition, which attracted a record 335,000 visitors. It will host another blockbuster exhibition this year when all of Van Eyck’s surviving portraitsare united for the first time.But in the current financial year, which ends in March, the gallery expects to face a deficit of about £2m. Without immediate remedial action, that was expected to grow by a further £6.2m next year to reach £8.2m, the Art Newspaper reported.It comes as cuts to public spending, rising operational costs and weak footfall have put considerable strain on UK museums. The National Gallery’s visitor numbers have still not recovered to their level before Covid, when it had six million a year. The figure for the 12 months to September 2025 was 3.8 million.Last May’s reopening of the Sainsbury Wing led to an improvement in footfall, but visitors usually come for the free permanent collection rather than ticketed exhibitions. The gallery has also had to navigate new business rates and national insurance payments, as well as inflation.It recently celebrated its bicentenary with NG200 and is looking to the future with Project Domani, theplanned construction of a major new wing to display modern art. It has received pledges of £150m each from Michael Moritz’s Crankstart Foundation and the Julia Rausing Trust , thought to be the two largest ever publicly reported single cash donations to a museum or gallery anywhere in the world. The budgets for both projects are ringfenced.“We have been successful in developing and vastly expanding our free offer, which is now hugely popular both in person and online,” the gallery’s spokesperson said. “We have also attracted huge investment in a landmark future project. However, in the present global landscape and with the cost of living crisis, like many other institutions, we face increasing competition for people’s time and share of wallet.”Noel McClean, the deputy general secretary of Prospect, said: “That a major gallery is in such a dire financial position shows just how difficult things are in the sector. It is becoming increasingly clear that the level of funding for these vital cultural institutions is nowhere near sufficient and we are paying the price with the loss of skilled workers.“If we don’t sort out a method of sustainable funding then the problems we’re seeing at National Gallery will be repeated across the country putting our heritage and culture at permanent risk.”The National Gallery currently receives an annual government grant of £32m. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has said it is in close contact with the gallery about its financial position. Decisions “relating to staffing and operational matters” were taken by the gallery’s trustees, it said.The gallery emphasised the need for a “strategic reset”. “We know this is hard, but we all must understand that things have changed in the world, and we must respond to them,” it said. “We need to make tough decisions now to futureproof the gallery for the years ahead.”Explore more on these topicsNational GalleryMuseumsLondonArts fundingnewsShareReuse this content"

This represents a significant overperformance compared to North America, where it took around $38m (UK box office usually amounts to around 10-15% of US haul).The home advantage might help account for some of the fervour around the film, which was shot by a British woman in the Yorkshire Dales, and the supporting cast of which also largely hails from the UK. Lukewarm reviews would likely not have dented box office significantly given strong pre-sales and a baked-in appetite over Valentine’s weekend.Wuthering Heights review – too hot, too greedy adaptation guarantees bad dreams in the nightRead moreThe film was released wide, across 761 sites, to a £10,030 average. Its weekend take in the UK already surpasses the £5.6m total domestic box office of Fennell’s previous film, Saltburn (although this was also a significant streaming hit); as well as last year’s hyped romantic dramaMaterialists, which took £3.9m in the UK.For comparison, Hamnet took £3m on its opening weekend in the UK and is currently on £16.4m, while The Housemaid started on £4.4m and is now on £29m. All four titles are aimed at a female demographic.However, Wuthering Heights’ haul falls below the £11.8m made byBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, which opened theatrically in the UK over Valentine’s weekend last year. That film finished its UK run with £46m; it went straight to streaming in the US.Warner Bros will be braced for a significant second week dropoff for the film, as the majority of pre-release bookings coincided with Valentine’s weekend. In the US, word of mouth is less strong than the studio might have hoped, and only51% of the opening-weekend audiencesaid that they would “definitely recommend” the film to friends.Moviegoers also gave it a B grade on CinemaScore, which polls audience members as they exit the cinema.The second and third place holders at the UK box office also mirrored those in the UK, with family sports animation GOAT taking £2.2m and acclaimed drama Crime 101 £1.4m.Explore more on these topicsFilmWuthering HeightsEmerald FennellMargot RobbieJacob ElordiFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It asked the museum to review its collections and revise terminology so relevant regions are referred to as Canaan, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, or Judea, depending on the period being described.While several displays have been updated, the museum has said these changes were made last year after feedback and audience research.View image in fullscreenThe Levant gallery at the British Museum.Photograph: IL Finkel/Photo courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum.It has said while the term “Palestine” was well established in western and Middle Eastern scholarship as a geographical and “neutral” designation for the southern area of the Levant since the late 19th century, it recognised that the term no longer holds a neutral designation and may be understood in reference to political territory.A spokesperson added: “For the Middle East galleries, for maps showing ancient cultural regions, the term ‘Canaan’ is relevant for the southern Levant in the later second millennium BC.“We use the UN terminology on maps that show modern boundaries, for example Gaza, West Bank, Israel, Jordan, and refer to ‘Palestinian’ as a cultural or ethnographic identifier where appropriate.”More than 5,000 people have since signed aChange.org petitioncalling for the museum to reverse its decision. The petition claims the move is “not supported by historical evidence and contributes to a wider pattern of erasing Palestinian presence from public memory”.According to UKLFI, the information panels in the Levant gallery, covering the period 2,000-300BC, have already been updated to describe the history of Canaan and the Canaanites and the rise of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. A panel in the Egypt galleries was amended to replace “Palestinian descent” with “Canaanite descent”.Further changes are expected as part of the museum’s long-term reconstruction and redisplay programme, and they will be implemented in the coming years.Explore more on these topicsBritish MuseumPalestineJudaismHistoryMiddle East and north AfricaLondonMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

My goal as the curator is to share the music and art that I love, and to celebrate the rich history of the venue.“We both share a passionate belief that music is a vital part of life. It brings us together, and the Southbank Centre has been at the heart of it, providing easy access to great music for the past 75 years. I’m incredibly grateful to Southbank for having me – it’s really exciting for me to have this opportunity in such an iconic venue.”No performers have yet been announced for the 31st edition of the festival, spanning 11-21 June, other than what will be a rare intimate show by Styles himself. The recently announced tour for Styles’s upcoming album, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally will make a record-breaking 12 stops at Wembley, each with a capacity of around 90,000 fans; the Southbank Centre’s main auditorium seats 2,700.A press release for the event states that Styles’s curatorship “will draw on his broad influences – from pop, soul, electronic and rock to underground scenes and emerging young British talent”. Styles’s recent comeback single, Aperture, channelled the softer end of dance music and was inspired, he said, by his experience of seeing LCD Soundsystem live for the first time.The schedule will also include a public programme of “interactive, participatory and free events, designed to engage young people across the UK and reflect ways younger audiences increasingly experience culture”, according to a release.‘Tickets have become status symbols’: from Harry Styles to Taylor Swift, why is live music bigger and more expensive than ever?Read moreSouthbank Centre artistic director Mark Ball said that they were “thrilled and excited that Harry Styles’s Meltdown sits at the heart of a 75th anniversary year that champions young people, their curiosity and creative freedom”. He added that the star’s plans feel “like a natural expression of what the Southbank Centre exists to do, and we are delighted to become his creative playground in our anniversary year”.After the end of his former band One Direction in 2016, Styles released his self-titled debut solo album in 2017. A second, Fine Line, arrived in 2019. Of all the former One Direction members, Styles has received the most critical acclaim – as well as commercial – and earned praise for the breadth of his inspirations. Nevertheless, he is the most pop-leaning act ever to curate Meltdown, whose curators have tended to come from the alternative and underground worlds rather than TV talent shows.Styles’s own tour commences in Amsterdam on 16 May, after a one-off performance at Manchester’s Co-op Live arena, in which he is an investor. The full lineup and ticket sale announcement for Meltdown will be announced in the spring.Explore more on these topicsHarry StylesSouthbank CentreMeltdown festivalFestivalsMusic festivalsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Whether Rice is observing the enforced machine-order of the production line, evaluating his own thoughts about cinema, music and literature, or empathising with the other workers, each individual short poem is a cherished fragment of perception seeking a moment of freedom from the tyranny of its time-stamp. The two pieces I’ve chosen are exactly four hours and more than 20 poems apart; distinct in tone and structure, each registers awareness that the potential of the individuals concerned, as a collective or singly, is frustrated by their socio-economic position.The workers in 01.29 are on a break, but their star-gazing is presented from the limited and immediate perspective in which the nearest stars are tobacco-sparks, “the exhaled Milky Way / of Bobby’s Golden Virginia”. The Milky Way leads only to earthbound “ways to navigate shift patterns”. Imaginative or intellectual speculation is forbidden by the laws of factory routine that the workers have had to internalise.Fully aware of that limitation, the speaker keeps possibility tamped down, while simultaneously acknowledging its power. The phrase “insanity of depth” inscribes the dizziness a free-spirited mental navigation of the cosmos might risk. The speaker and his colleagues are necessary conspirators against visions, star-gazers from the depth of despairing realism. While the poem insists on “nothing seismic or anything approaching / truth”, it acknowledges that the denial falls far short of human “depth”. Stars, increasingly distant, mark time like the numerals on the digital clock but infinitely slower: whereas the sparks released from “Bobby’s Golden Virginia” are all too ephemeral, “the dotted starlight/ doesn’t burn fast enough” for the night-shift workers.In the second poem, the speaker focuses on a single worker, “wee Gail”, and, by the second line, although her 70th birthday was “last week”, the present-continuous tense is seemingly established: “she has a special / seat to sit on all shift”. Her seat may be connected to the friendly recognition of her birthday, but, more likely, she habitually occupies a particular bench-space for ergonomic reasons, in line with company regulations. The image of the seat is rightly left for the reader to form – and then to transform.Centrally placed, a single line of monosyllables illustrates the one-dimensionality of Gail’s service “in the same place for so long”, but the resumed triplets have her “making light work” of it all as she skilfully performs her task, “sifting defective ring washers / from those within tolerance”. The poet-speaker, too, makes light work of the romantic, celebratory turn after “and” at the end of the third triplet, when the ensuing pause instigates the vision of deft-fingered Gail as, perhaps, a concert pianist. This wouldn’t be impossible “in another life”. Even here, Rice is almost curbed by realism. Somehow, he succeeds in lifting that heavy shadow cast by “another life”, dissolving it in the glow of what feels like genuine admiration and genuine affirmation.In an endnote, Rice pays tribute to a book set in 1830 by the French philosopher, Jacques Rancière,Proletarian Nights: The Worker’s Dream in 19th-Century France. In Rancière’s vision of socialism, labourers desire, and have the potential for, freedom from their work. Rice addresses the mental and physical costs of the labour treadmill, and, as a poet andson of a poet, he is haunted by the concept of repressed creative potential in others. The poem about “wee Gail” is a particularly direct and moving expression of that vision.The fulfillment of Rancière’s ideal looms close to us in the age of AI, with the decline of human labour at even the white-collar level, and in production lines’ replacement-staffing by robots. Freedom for self-fulfillment will be available, in theory, but how will it be inscribed and allocated by our institutions? The many questions will be tough to solve. In the meantime, the poems in plastic both honour and transcend their traditional factory setting, and remind us of how much there could be to gain in the dawning digital era.plastic: A Poem by Matthew Rice, is published in the UKby Fitzcarraldo Editionsand in the USby Soft Skull Press.This article was amended on 16 February 2026 because an earlier version referred to Jacques Rancière’s Proletarian Nights: The Worker’s Dream in 19th-Century France, as “an 1830 book”. The book is set in 1830, but was published in 1981.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Humour, of course, in the things the child misinterprets; pathos in the things they feel they must keep hidden; jeopardy in the dangers we can see, and they cannot. As any relative or babysitter can attest, even the sweetest child can become mind-numbingly dull when they’re all the company one has, so there’s a skill to charm without boring. The other skill is to find ways of enabling the reader to read over the child’s shoulder, as it were, to piece together for themselves the adult dramas to which a child’s natural egotism, or simple innocence, blinds them.In 1988, the longsuffering mother in Seán Farrell’s first novel, Frogs for Watchdogs, is stranded. This Englishwoman has had a boy and a girl with a handsome rogue of an Irish actor, but he has walked out on them. Asked to leave a commune unsuited to children, skint, too proud, perhaps, to return to the protection of well-heeled parents in England, she rents a farmhouse on the cheap in the deep countryside of County Meath, where she can grow vegetables, raise hens and a few sheep, and attempt to scrabble a living as a healer. (From the multiple dilutions her boy witnesses her perform, her fairly batty practice would seem to be some form of homeopathy with new age elements thrown in.) While her doubtless appalled parents insist on sending the oldest child, a forthright girl called B, to an English boarding school, B’s younger brother spends months running happily feral. Once he is eight, he will be old enough to follow her and be tamed and anglicised.Unnamed, so that he becomes a sort of Everyboy, he is a vividly unwashed, scabby-kneed creation, consumed by a little-man protective love for his mother and sister, ruled by devoutly held private rituals that are bound up in the passionate interest he takes in the landscape, birds and animals around him, from the screeching crows to the easily spooked Jacob’s sheep. He is drawn to a no less eccentric and evidently lonely old woman in the village, to whom he delivers his mother’s cures and who repays him with biscuits, barely comprehended scandal and snatches of doomy superstition to match his own.So far, so muddily idyllic, but then a farm worker from Inishmaan, Gearóid Ó Direáin, who lives in a caravan up the road, starts to take an interest, helping the boy’s mother build a drystone wall and taking cures from her in turn. The boy follows the anglophone locals and wilfully mispronounces his Irish name, dubbing him Jerry Drain. Deeply mistrustful, fighting the instincts of a fatherless boy to be drawn to a father figure, he meets his low-key charm offensive with a campaign of unsmiling wordlessness. When that fails, and as even his sternly bookish sister seems to be succumbing, he mixes rat poison into the latest cure his mother has him deliver to Gearóid, recovering his tongue sufficiently to deliver the instruction to swallow multiple doses.Frogs for Watchdogs was garlanded with praise on its Irish publication last spring, and it’s easy to see why. It is funny, evokes a child’s vivid sense of place and ultimately is deeply touching as Gearóid trains up the boy to help him in a chip van venture, gives him discreet lessons in how to be a decent man and, as the time approaches when the regular bathing and school uniform of England can no longer be avoided, wins him over by minute degrees, as one might coax trust from a stray dog.The pity is that Farrell doesn’t entirely trust his ability to convey all the reader needs to understand through the boy’s own voice. On several occasions he slips into Gearóid’s head, to give us his perspective on the boy. Because this tells us nothing we haven’t already guessed, apart from the fact that Gearóid lost his own father to a drowning when he was the boy’s age, it serves merely to disrupt the child-centred narrative and to make the man seem less intriguing, even a sentimental figure. This is a minor criticism, however, of a novel whose crinkle-eyed charm is so hard to resist.Frogs for Watchdogs by Seán Farrell is published by John Murray (£14.99).

The last time the pair appeared together was 2001, when The Mummy Returns (itself an insipid sequel to 1999’s much better The Mummy) hit multiplexes. Since then we’ve had a spin-off (2002’s The Scorpion King, featuring an early turn from Dwayne Johnson) and a second sequel that didn’t feature Weisz, 2008’s forgettable The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.And then, of course, there was the ill-fated “Dark Universe”, forever immortalised bythat solemn publicity photographof Russell Crowe (Dr Jekyll), Javier Bardem (Frankenstein’s Monster), Tom Cruise and Johnny Depp (The Invisible Man) staring into the middle distance like an ageing goth supergroup. The plan was to launch an interconnected saga in which Jekyll would act as a sort of monster-movie Nick Fury, corralling Dracula, Frankenstein and assorted undead assets into a synergised Marvel-style cinematic ecosystem. Fortunately it rapidly fell apart: 2017’s Cruise-led The Mummy landed with all the grace of a cursed sarcophagus dropped down a lift shaft. And that, as far as the Dark Universe was concerned, was that. Universal pivoted to smaller films such as Leigh Whannell’s The Invisible Man, while Bardem’s Monster and Depp’s Invisible Man never materialised at all.View image in fullscreenAgeing goth band … the ‘Dark Universe’ stars, from left, Russell Crowe, Javier Bardem, Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp and Sofia Boutella.Photograph: Marco Grob/Unive/THA/ShutterstockNow it appears the studio has reverted to that pre-2010s era in which movies often featured a clear, linear story, sometimes with a beginning, middle and end. In the absence of any other clear plans for The Mummy, you can’t really blame it. Fraser is in the middle of a career resurgence off the back of Darren Aronofsky’s The Whale, and Weisz has never been away. If the original Fraser-Weisz-era Mummy filled a gap created by Steven Spielberg’s refusal to make more Indiana Jones movies, this belated sequel has the advantage of debuting when the latter series looks dead and buried after the lukewarm response to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.Is the era of cinematic universes as a whole now coming to an end? Sony’s Spider-Man-without-Spider-Man experiment has limped quietly away. The Flash felt less like a triumphant multiverse caper than DC’s continuity collapsing in on itself. And while Marvel Studios is hardly packing up the Infinity Stones just yet, there are persistent whispers that the next pair of Avengers films – Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars – may function as a convenient narrative reset.And yet the reality is that audiences don’t so much hate cinematic universes as feel disgruntled when studios announce entire multiversal macro-sagas before anyone has seen the credits roll on the first instalment. When Marvel brought out Iron Man in 2008, there were already plans to unite Tony Stark with Captain America and Thor in Avengers movies, but the studio made sure all these entries worked before trying to mash them together. The best part of two decades on, the studio is facing diminishing box office returns and (arguably) multiverse fatigue after trying too hard to turn casual viewers into reluctant archivists.View image in fullscreenA brisk, pulpy adventure … 1999’s The Mummy.Photograph: Album/AlamyPerhaps this is why the prospect of a new Mummy film feels faintly radical. No extended monster roll-call, no roadmap presentation disguised as narrative, no solemn announcement that Dr Jekyll will return in Tomb of the Shared Continuity. Just a brisk, pulpy adventure in which attractive people sprint towards danger, exchange flirtatious barbs and resolve the central problem. In 1999 this was simply called “a blockbuster”. In 2026 it may qualify as niche programming.And maybe that is the lesson beneath Universal’s strategic retreat. Audiences did not revolt against interconnected storytelling so much as grow weary of being conscripted into it. The connective tissue became the point. The scaffolding overshadowed the structure. What began as an occasional thrill – a cameo here, a crossover there – slowly mutated into homework. A Fraser-Weisz reunion, by contrast, promises something almost unfashionable: narrative closure. If it works, it will not be because it resurrects an old property, but because it resurrects the until-recently-unfashionable idea that a story can simply conclude.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekBrendan FraserRachel WeiszScience fiction and fantasy filmsUniversal PicturesHorror filmscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s pitch-black out on a Pyrenean mountainside. Wagnerian lightning illuminates the ridges and the rain sheeting down. Bells clank in darkness as the sheep flee en masse to the other side of the col. Yves, the shepherd in charge, faces down this bewilderment, trying to perceive the threat: “Are those eyes?”The Shepherd and the Bear, directed by Max Keegan, is part of a new breed of films with a heightened sympathy for country matters. Surveying the wind-ruffled pastures, lingering in battered cabins, it’s a highly cinematic depiction of the conflict in the Pyrenees provoked by the reintroduction of the brown bear. Much past rural cinema made hay from insisting we beware of the locals: Deliverance’s vicious hicks, The Wicker Man’s wily pagans, Hot Fuzz’s Barbour-jacketed cabal for the “greater good”. But the new school rides with the locals like Keegan’s film taps their knowledge and tells us what they’ve known all along: that it’s nature that’s truly scary.With the Ariègedépartementruralists in semi-revolt against laws that stop them culling the bears, and Yves struggling to find a successor, The Shepherd and the Bear is typical of European neo-rural cinema in focusing on collisions and conflicts of tradition and modernity in the 21st-century countryside.View image in fullscreenNew countryside alliances … The Eight Mountains.Photograph: Alberto NovelliIt’s a windfarm vetoed by French arrivistes that causes meltdown in Spanish Galicia in 2022’s crime thrillerThe Beasts, while Catalonia’s peach groves are to be uprooted for solar panels in the delicate dramaAlcarràs, from the same year. The town and country divide quietly underpinned the story of a Turin prodigal son’s return to Italy’s Aosta valley in the epicThe Eight Mountains(2022). And 2020 documentaryThe Truffle Huntersdepicted the last stand of Piedmont’s geriatric mushroom men.The Beasts and The Eight Mountains both deal explicitly with a growing phenomenon: the return of urbanites to the land, a cohort the French callles néoruraux. This partly accounts for cinema’s sharpened familiarity with countryside concerns, with some film-makers even personally spanning the divide. Francis Lee, who directed 2017’sGod’s Own Country– about a tryst between a Yorkshire sheep farmer and a Romanian labourer – grew up in that milieu. Louise Courvoisier, director of last year’s tearaway cheese-making dramaHoly Cow, splits her time between film-making and working on her family’s farm in the Jura region.View image in fullscreenTearaway cheesemakers … Holy Cow.Photograph: Laurent Le Crabe/Zeitgeist FilmsEven if neo-rural films aren’t directed by countryfolk, they no longer feel like works made by hapless outsiders who would, were they in a film themselves, be liable to face the wrong end of an aggressive banjo solo. Hope Dickson Leach’sThe Levelling(2017) lays out the suffocating pressures on British farmers with sobering grace; in France, 2023’sSuper Bourrés(a kind of Gallic Superbad about home-brewing teens) andJunkyard Dog(a sort of Gallic Withnail and I about a dysfunctional friendship), show strong familiarity with the scrappy, hard-partying ennui outside the cities. Grímur Hákonarson’sRams(2015) – which makes an Old Testament feud of a pair of sheep-farming brothers – does something similar for Iceland.There have been earthy, intimate rural films in earlier decades: Peter Hall’s generational village chronicleAkenfield(1974); or Manon des Sources (1986), about Provençal water conflicts; or Béla Tarr’sSátántangó(1994), more than seven hours of unrelenting misery in the Hungarian mud. One thing that marks out the recent flurry, though, is an artisanal reverence for rural producers that, in the era of Vittles foodie culture, is quite distinct from past miserabilism. From Yves’ herding in The Shepherd and the Bear, to the tomato and peach cultivators in The Beasts and Alcarràs, and the quest for the perfect comté in Holy Cow, it’s striking how many of the neo-rural brigade find heroism in supplying the horn of plenty.The old ways still persist in some quarters – this is the countryside after all. Hoary demonisation of queer rural folk is still an easy win, cropping up lately in the scrumpy-making sociopathic child-snatchers in 2024’sSpeak No Evil, or the “very country” ensemble of village freaks all played by Rory Kinnear in 2022’sMen. The acceleration of folk-horror in the UK from its beginnings in the 1960s to the glut of recent years has been something to behold; the recent documentaryThe Last Sacrificeexplains it as the product of a particular British insularity that also puts up impenetrable hedgerows within our isles themselves – resulting in the dark fascination of the urban imagination with what lies beyond.View image in fullscreenOld ways … The Last Sacrifice.Photograph: Anti-WorldsIt’s striking that the continent produces virtually no folk-horror. Perhaps this is due to a different, less mythologised, more pragmatic relationship with the land (the UK still imports nearly half of its food, compared with 20% in France). But the tensions – whether between rural old-timers and urban wantaways, traditional methods and modern eco directives – are there.And neo-rural cinema is there to witness that violence can erupt around them: in The Beasts, the enmity between worn-down locals and the idealistic newcomer leads to some very tense games of dominoes and then a sudden murder. A bear is finally shot in a neighbouring region in The Shepherd and the Bear, and Yves and other locals mutter dark approval. With such pent-up passions in the air, it’s easy to see how country life begat folk-horror – but digging into the raw reality allows us to see the furrows go so much deeper.The Shepherd and the Bear is released in UK cinemas on 6 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsRural affairsFolkestone TriennialDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After returning from filming in Tbilisi to Berlin, where the 42-year-old Georgian artist lives, he was suffering from shortness of breath. An X-ray revealed that both his lungs had filled with water. He was told to get a taxi to the German capital’s Charité hospital straight away if he wanted to live.View image in fullscreenGiorgi Gagoshidze in Berlin today.Photograph: Clara IanniGagoshidze was diagnosed with T-cell lymphoma, a rare, aggressive and fast-growing form of blood cancer in an advanced but curable stage. A brutal cocktail of chemotherapy followed by an eight-month hospital stay in isolation was his only shot at survival.“Everything just collapsed,” he recalls. “And the art world is very merciless. It can devour you faster than cancer.”Yet this week, barely three years on from his diagnosis, Gagoshidze’s documentary, Graft Versus Host, will have its premiere at the Berlin film festival. Just 31 minutes long, it is nonetheless packed with ideas, juggling archive footage, personal reflections and DIY computer graphics in a style reminiscent of English documentarian Adam Curtis or German video essayistHito Steyerl, under whom Gagoshidze studied at the Berlin University of the Arts.Visually chaotic, its historical vision is remarkably lucid. Because while the cancer physically immobilised him, his diagnosis also opened up his mind to understanding the events in the eastern bloc in his lifetime in new ways. “My treatment plan quite accurately mirrored the Soviet collapse and its post-transition plan,” he says.In Gagoshidze’s adopted home city, the post-1989 economic re-integration of the two Germanies is often framed in terms of an annexation of the socialist east by the capitalist west – the title of one acclaimed book on the subject isThe Takeover. But from Georgia, the shift from one system to another looks more complex.View image in fullscreenBodies in revolt … a still from Graft Versus Host, showing the statue of Lenin in Potsdam Volkspark outside Berlin.Photograph: Giorgi Gago GagoshidzeIn 1973, the first secretary of the Georgian Communist party Eduard Shevardnadze had launched an economic experiment in the western village of Abasha, whereby farmers were allowed to keep a portion of their harvest’s surplus crops or sell them for personal profit.“As the economy was declining, the Communist party was looking for ways to stimulate the workforce and decided to introduce a limited form of ownership,” Gagoshidze says.The Abasha experiment was a success: the village’s agricultural output rocketed and solved food shortages, triggering administrative reforms around Georgia and boosting the reformist image of Shevardnaze, later a foreign minister under Mikhail Gorbachev.View image in fullscreenA still from Graft Versus Host.Photograph: Giorgi Gago GagoshidzeWhen Gagoshidze carried out interviews about Abasha in Georgia, he found that not just officials but also his own relatives were still full of nostalgia about the country’s former status as the eastern bloc’s economic vanguard.Yet at the same time, he says, “Abasha paved the way for the Soviet Union’s collapse”, by creating a new breed of illegal enterprises with access to state-run facilities. Known astsekhoviks, these underground entrepreneurs built a shadow economic system based on corruption. It meant that when the Soviet system collapsed, it could not be reformed step-by-step but tipped straight into a turbo-charged variant of capitalism.“When the Soviet Union collapsed, everything collapsed”, he recalls. “I remember one day my mum took me to the supermarket and all the essentials were there. The next time she took me, she had to beg the people working for anything edible whatsoever, because the shelves were empty. And then we got back home and there was no gas, no hot water, nothing.”In Graft Versus Host, Gagoshidze likens this moment to his own course of radiotherapy. “Introducing a new immune system in a host is only viable when cancer cells have been successfully suppressed,” he says, “just like the transition required full privatisation for the functionality of the proposed new economic system”.His treatment came in three steps, and wiping out the cancer cells in his system was the easier part. The more challenging procedure was to introduce a new immune system – via a bone marrow transplant – and for his body to adapt to the system.Gagoshidze got the bone marrow transplant from his father, which meant the tissue type was only half-matching his own and resulted in the disease that gives his film its name, graft-versus-host-disease or GvHD, where the newly transplanted immune system starts to fight its recipient’s.“It’s like a permanent civil war in the body,” he says. Medication was crucial to stop the fighting. “The role of the medicine was to keep my new immune system dizzy so it didn’t kill me off. But post-Soviet countries did not have any medication to stop the system fighting with itself: we had an immune system transplant without any form of regulation.”More than three decades on, the country remains stuck in the adaptation phase. “Nowadays, Georgian farmers are free to keep all the money from their business themselves, but they no longer have the technology and equipment being provided by the state, and they have to find new markets for their crops outside Georgia.”View image in fullscreen‘Everything just collapsed’… still from Graft Versus Host.Photograph: Giorgi Gago GagoshidzeThe country seceded from the Soviet Union in 1991 and was granted EU candidate status in 2023, but its bid was effectively halted a year later over severe democratic backsliding. The former model reformists are lodged at the back of the queue. “It’s a loop that never ends, a constant state of catching up but never arriving,” says Gagoshidze. “It’s a vicious circle.”His personal situation is looking more hopeful, at least. The artist’s graft-versus-host-disease was relatively mild, and doctors tell him that if his health remains stable until the autumn, he can consider himself cured. “The doctors are happy, and if they are happy, I am happy.”Graft versus Host premieres at the Berlin film festival on 16 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsBerlin film festival 2026Documentary filmsGeorgiaCommunismCancerEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This Hindi gangland epic’s credentials are impeccable: director Vishal Bhardwaj previously wowed with textured, inventive variations on Macbeth (Maqbool, 2003), Othello (Omkara, 2006) and Hamlet (Haider, 2014). But rather than a straightforward modernisation of Romeo and Juliet, this latest revisits a grisly true-crime story ripped from Hussain Zaidi’s Mafia Queens of Mumbai, the book that previously inspiredSanjay Leela Bhansali’s 2022 hit, Gangubai Kathiawadi. The results align Bhardwaj with the newly lurid turn mainstream Bollywood has taken with recent smashes Animal and Dhurandhar, but it’s jarring to witness, as if Kenneth Branagh had followed his turn-of-the-90s Shakespeare successes by trying for Natural Born Killers.For Venice (or Baz Luhrmann’s Venice Beach), Bhardwaj swaps the Mumbai underworld of the 1990s, ushering in the movies’ first morally degenerate Romeo. Shahid Kapoor’s Hussein Ustara – nicknamed Romeo – is a heavily tattooed bellower employed as a hitman for a local godfather; his Juliet (Animal’s Triptii Dimri) an aggrieved widow clutching a sizeable hitlist. These two are star-crossed: he rescues her amid a bungled assassination attempt on the lawyer smearing her late husband, earning them both powerful foes. The fish tank through which Leo glimpsed Claire Danes here abuts the bed to which this Romeo takes two escorts while his Juliet listens in. Happy Valentine’s Day, everybody.Bold image-making and considered design are visible through the murk, and the performances are strong. Kapoor and Dimri commit to this plot’s peculiar demands, while Nana Patekar is appreciably sly as our antihero’s wearied handler. Yet where Gangubai showcased Bhansali’s heightened tonal sensitivity, the gruelling three hours here veer between crude and emotionally inert: a tale of obsession and abjection, with its dead-eyed lovers dragging one another towards the gutter and the grave. It’s the kind of distinctive misfire that could only be made by someone who is so hung up on a story they swallow its poisons whole. Still, it’s mildly heartbreaking to see such a thoughtful cineaste tossing his library card for the leering tough guy.O’Romeo is in cinemas now.Explore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsBollywoodFilm adaptationsRomeo and JulietWilliam ShakespeareIndiareviewsShareReuse this content"

Gene Tierney wrangled civil war rebels in Belle Starr. Betty Hutton pranced around with a shotgun in a sparkly red cowgirl get-up, alongside a cowhide-wearing Howard Keel, in Annie Get Your Gun. But cinemagoers were thrown a curveball three years later when they gotDoris Day– again with baritone sidekick Keel in tow – dressed, wise-cracking and swaggering exactly like a man.‘Reconciliation across difference’: why Practical Magic is my feelgood movieRead moreAdmittedly, when I first saw Calamity Jane aged nine, I was also not immediately sold. Not because of Day’s gender non-conformity, which had me hooked, but because of the bizarreness of the pseudo-biopic’s synopsis and its grating musical numbers. TheNew York Timeshad a point when they deemed it “shrill and preposterous”. Then there was the fact that on first look it appeared to be a western. Part crooning romcom, part frontier drama, it’s a strange beast of a film, but I was soon won over.Sometime in the 1870s, Calamity Jane resides in a Dakota saloon town appropriately named Deadwood. We first meet her as the opening credits roll, galloping home, squawking the unlikely refrain “whip crack-away” – the first of many annoying but infectious ditties – before she arrives and melodically introduces Deadwood’s denizens – oddly lacking women – including Wild Bill (Keel). Calamity, who has a hot head and a big mouth, sees the frequenters of her favourite haunt, the Golden Garter, drooling over a “cigar-eet” packet picture of actor Adelaid Adams (Gale Robbins). In an effort to impress her pals, she promises she’ll bring the vaudevillian from “Chicagi” to the backwater town and much chaos ensues.In many ways, the storyline of this merry caper is unfortunately regressive, because of its sexist attitudes and the horrific colonial violence wrought by the real-life Calamity, Martha Jane Canary. (Thanks to the frontierswoman’s yarn-spinning, this is a rather fanciful, unverifiable biopic.) But for me as a tomboy growing up in the early noughties, Day’s performance was a revelation. I instantly recognised her aversion to girly clothing and her desperation to be one of the boys. Day, who until that point had exclusively played rosy-cheeked romantic leads – the vehicle of many of David Butler’s prior movies – is transformed into a feisty, chin-jutting, strutting alpha.Calamity is unapologetically ballsy, scrappy and even smelly. She fires her pistol into the heavens anytime she simply wants to make a point. The whipsmart sharpshooter was the only cinematic female hero I had come across who was not Angelina Jolie wearing hot-pants. Unlike most female and non-binary characters then on screens, James O’Hanlon’s script gave Calamity all the best lines: “This town ain’t big enough for the both of us, not for that frilled-up, flirtin’, man-rustlin’ petticoat it ain’t.”Butler’s campy, rollicking flick was, probably unintentionally, among the queerest Hollywood releases of its time. It starts off with what is essentially a drag show – despite not being to the Deadwood crowd’s tastes. Then, in a hilarious meet-cute, the Adelaid who Calamity fetches from “the windy city” turns out to be the less vocally gifted, but more “purty” Katie Brown (Allyn Ann McLerie). They shack up together in a kitschy, chintzy queer cottage of dreams. Many have taken Jane for a lesbian, but when she and Katie become rivals for the affection of blue-buttoned Lieutenant Danny Gilmartin (Philip Carey), Calamity seems to experience every bisexual’s nightmare: the two people she fancies getting together.The true appeal of this unashamedly yankee tale is the breezy, trouble-free world this gender-non-conforming character occupies. Calamity’s masc wardrobe turns heads, but she couldn’t care less. Inhabiting this guileless world over the course of an hour and a half is the only remedy for low spirits I could ever need, and sometimes it’s difficult to resist belting out a few of the twee ballads too.ThatOut Magazinecalled the musical’s top-line track Secret Love the first gay anthem is unsurprising. With lyrics like “now, I shout it from the highest hills” and “at last my heart’s an open door”, it would unmistakably seem a coming-out song – it’s just a shame she’s actually crooning about Wild Bill. O’Hanlon’s script may eventually have the prairie protagonist settle and buckle a little under the weight of societal standards, but the fact that the film has been reclaimed and subsumed into queer culture is part of its unalloyed joy. I may have been cursed to forever have Day shrilly intoning “no, siree!” in a loop in my head, but it’s worth the suffering.Calamity Jane is available to rent digitally in the US and UK and on HBO Max in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsDoris DayMy feelgood movieMusicalsWesternsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a film which, for all its grimness, is beautifully shot and as engrossing as a lurid soap opera. It’s a story of gender stereotypes, satirising the central mythic tenet of patriarchal Christianity and depicting humanity’s self-invention through violence and stealth. The chief influence is clearly Michael Haneke’s icy black-and-white film The White Ribbon from 2009, on which Schleinzer worked as casting director; Schleinzer shares with Haneke an interest in leaving the audience with an intractable, insoluble mystery: a problem that won’t tie up.The drama effectively conflates real-life cases ofwomen passing themselves off as men in early modern Europewith the well-known case history of theFrench false claimant Martin Guerre. Sandra Hüller gives a superb performance as Rose, a young woman who has been posing as a man all her life and has been a soldier in this guise. She wears dour shapeless clothes, and has the brisk, brusque, economical physical movements of an old soldier; a livid scar that has transformed her face into a worldly and conveniently unfeminine grimace. She says it is the result of a bullet that she now wears around her neck on a cord, a kind of unlucky charm, a reminder of her survival.After the war, Rose arrived in what she claims is her home village to take family ownership of a derelict but potentially workable farmstead. By recounting local anecdotes that only the genuine claimant could know, Rose convinces the local elders (who have evidently accepted “Rose” as her surname) and almost immediately makes a great success of the farm through her disciplined hard work. She moreover wins the locals’ hearts by killing a marauding bear with her military musket.A prosperous neighbour agrees to sell Rose a parcel of land on condition that Rose marries his daughter Suzanna (Caro Braun), a plain and promisingly biddable figure of bovine piety and domestic industry. But if Suzanna does not get pregnant, the contract is null and void, and the villagers will begin to talk. So it is with some astonishment that Rose receives extraordinary news from the beaming and placidly innocent Suzanna. How? Who is the father? The question is asked just twice, first put directly by Rose to Suzanna who does not reply. Rose does not pursue it, perhaps assuming some banal infidelity, and in any case grateful for the virgin-birth miracle which has underpinned her growing household wealth.The second time it is put by the presiding judge to Rose at her trial. She has answered previously with a defiant calm reminiscent ofRenée Jeanne Falconetti in Dreyer’s The Passion of Joan of Arc, but this time does not reply. The judge also does not press the point, perhaps not wanting to deflect or complicate the prosecution case, or make a potential new land claimant of the biological father. Nor would he want to risk, with Rose’s repeated refusals to answer, creating a martyrdom-mystique around the defendant who is already becoming a celebrity among the excitable public. And there is to be a further, startling disclosure.Hüller’s quiet, sinewy performance provides the film’s form and musculature; Rose has clearly been through a thousand crises and ordeals on the field of battle and learned the level-headed watchfulness necessary to survive. Braun is also very good as the unexpectedly spirited Suzanna. This is a film about the power and violence that occupies an invisible stratum below the bürgerlich calm, a stratum which becomes obvious when it is challenged. It’s another outstanding star performance from Hüller.Rose screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsGermanyAustriaBerlin film festivalBerlin film festival 2026reviewsShareReuse this content"

Shot in various conservation parks and rescue centres acrossArgentina, Jessica Sarah Rinland’s sensuous documentary poetically foregrounds the physical and emotional contact that occurs between animals and their carers, even within these spaces of surveillance. From rare giant anteaters to flamingo colonies, the isolated creatures are stunningly varied.Interestingly, Rinland rarely frames the animals by themselves. Instead, we see them actively engaging with human workers during feeding or weighting routines, often in closeup that accentuates minute gestures and expressions. There are echoes of Rinland’s previous works, which lingered on the hands of archivists, farmers or ecologists; those in fact who relate to their environments in a tactile way. In the case of zoo workers, however, they deal not with inanimate plants or archival records, but living, breathing beings. The bonds between them and the animals are profound, but rarely friction-free.The sumptuous 16mm film stock enhances the texture of these encounters between the human and the non-human, and the film is punctuated by bursts of infrared footage from night-vision cameras used to monitor the animals. Such juxtaposition poses thorny questions about their situation: can these creatures ever be truly free? There are colonial vestiges embedded within these spaces too. The Buenos Aires Eco-Park, one of the highlighted organisations, was originally modelled after European zoos, institutions designed to boost imperialist conquest.The film ends with a title card contextualising its own title, which comes from findings by psychologist Jean Piaget – part of his theory is that, in the early stages of a child’s life, they have the egocentric belief that nature is made for them. However, it’s a line that ends up reducing the film’s scope rather than widening it; although Rinland acknowledges the colonial roots behind conservation, this bookending quote reinforces the dichotomy between human and nature, neglecting the complex geopolitical forces behind environmental issues.Collective Monologue is in UK cinemas from 20 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsZoosArgentinaAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

One is PowerPoint comedy; the other is humour mined from personal trauma. At first, form is foregrounded over content, as Sharp goes wild with a clicker, projecting his introductory battery of “hellos”, “hi’s” and “welcomes” in ginormous letters on an upstage screen. There will be 2,000 slides in this 75-minute show, he tells us, and they will demonstrate that every beat is (despite appearances) scripted and preordained.And so the stage is set for a feat of virtuosity from the former child magician – but also some reveal of why this frantic mode of presentation is right for the story Sharp has to tell. Is it to do with his generation’s habit of double-screening their entertainment? He hints it might be, then moves on. What we get instead is the coming-out story of this southerner turned New Yorker, which involves his mother’s terminal cancer and, obliquely, his own watery near-death experience a few years ago.Do these two shows satisfyingly unite into a coherent whole? Sharp throws himself at that challenge, roping in Schrödinger’s cat and quantum immortality theory to undergird his exploration of being alive and dead (or on stage and on screen) all at the same time. In a show forever alert to its own status as confessional performance (“theatre with an r-e,” in his words), he also admits that all this tech whizzery is designed to conceal the cliche of talking parental bereavement and queer self-discovery on stage.For me, the constant underscoring, echoing and backchat on screen distracts from – keeps at a distance, even – what’s most meaningful about Sharp’s story. But that tale still packs a considerable punch, and its teller is an endearing presence throughout. There are solid stand-alone standup bits (about urban umbrella usage and a “weenie massage”), amusingly arch Gen-Z stylings and an affecting tenderness towards his mum and dad. And if the PowerPoint gimmick and emotional rites-of-passage can feel as if they’re pulling in different directions – well, the combination (super-slick slideshow theatrics, big laughs and heart-on-a-stick story to boot) still represent pretty big bang for your buck.At Soho theatre, London, until 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But how to cram 20 years of romance into two tune-filled hours? By focusing on the little moments, say its creatorsMiriam GillinsonMon 16 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GooglePlaywright David Greig and director Max Webster are not afraid of a theatrical challenge. The last show they worked on together –The Loraxat London’s Old Vic in 2015 – transformed a complicated Dr Seuss story about capitalism, global heating and a grumpy forest guardian into a bright and breezy family show. Greig has tackled mammoth musicals (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) and mountainside thrillers (Touching the Void), while Webster’s biggest hit,The Life of Pi, conjured up floating tigers and raging storms with theatrical flair and swagger.Now the two are collaborating on astaged musicalof David Nicholls’s much-loved – and much-adapted – novel One Day, first published in 2009. That might sound like a relatively straightforward theatrical challenge but there are pitfalls aplenty when it comes to staging the near-iconic love story, which follows would-be couple Dex and Em’s relationship over the same day – 15 July – across two decades. A case in point: the fairly disastrous2011 filmstarring Anne Hathaway.While the film may act as a warning to would-be adaptors, the huge popularity of theNetflix seriesin 2024, starring Ambika Mod and Leo Woodall, presents its own challenges. Can there be such a thing as too much One Day? And can the beautifully low-key yet devastating romance of the TV series really be bettered? The creative team behind the musical don’t seem too concerned. “The Netflix adaptation doesn’t affect us,” insists a softly spoken Greig. “It’s such a different process for us. It’s like we’re making a butter sculpture of One Day. We’re just in a different field.”View image in fullscreenScreen time … Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess in the 2011 film of One Day.Photograph: Focus Features/Sportsphoto/AllstarWhen we meet in a cafe just before Christmas, with festive love songs blaring over the speakers, the creative team are six weeks into rehearsals. A complete first draft of Greig’s script is nearly in sight, the songs – composed by the US husband-and-wife pop duo Abner and Amanda Ramirez, AKA Johnnyswim – are still being written, and choreographer Carrie-Anne Ingrouille is only in the very early stages of bringing Dex and Em’s love story kicking into life.Greig and Webster have been working on the production, which will be staged at Edinburgh’s Royal Lyceum theatre, for just over a year. While that’s really quite quick for a large-scale musical, the process has presented a number of theatrical conundrums: from how to cram a 20-year love affair into just two hours to how to conjure up a show that has enough theatrical heft from a tale that is all about the little moments in life and the tiny coincidences that can make or break a relationship.Webster seems almost giddy when he points out the myriad of challenges he faces: “What’s it like to change and grow over 20 years? How do you express that through words and music? But also how do you reflect on British history over 20 years? Nicholls’s novel is about two individuals’ lives but it’s also about the texture of life; the stuff – the brands, culture and weird social quirks – we grew up with.”I think the Edinburgh audience is going to be perfect. Perhaps a bit cheekily, they now think they own the story of One DayOne of the ways the team plan to ground their adaptation and create ample emotional impact is through song. It helps, says Greig, that Abner and Amanda Ramirez are enthusiasts of Nicholls’s novel: “They’ve got a borderline obsession with One Day. I think there’s something brilliant and miraculous about the fact thatDavid Nichollshas written this very specific play about suburban middle-class Britain and yet Abner and Amanda, who met in Nashville, find it completely them. And hundreds, thousands, millions of people around the world think the same thing when they read the novel: ‘It’s me, it’s me, it’s me!’”Abner and Amanda’s backstory could have been written by Nicholls himself. The two first met after a church service in Nashville in 2001 but only really got to know each other at a songwriting session four years later. They’ve been creating music together ever since, as well as podcasts, cooking shows and countless other creative ventures – plus three small children. Everything they dream up together draws on their own life experiences and their songs, which are a blend of pop, folk and country, are sensitively observed and deeply personal compositions.The songs will be performed by experienced musical stars Jamie Muscato (Dex) and Sharon Rose (Em), both of whom, enthuses Webster, “provide truthful acting and virtuosic singing by the bucket load”. The music will hopefully elevate the novel’s small but critical moments – the fractious dinners, forgotten letters and stolen kisses – and make them powerful enough for the theatre. “The book is made up of so many intricate moments but song can take those moments and fill the theatre with emotion,” says Webster. “A moment that may sound quite small, when told as an anecdote, can still feel huge. If a person isn’t nice to you over dinner that might seem like a small story but, actually, the feeling you have inside as you walk home that night fills up the whole evening sky. Song can do that.”Ironically, there is something about the ordinariness of Nicholls’s novel – the low-key nature of Em and Dex’s timeless love affair – that seems to make it so special. It is a quality that Webster is keen to reflect in his production: “What we’re saying, in the end, is that it’s worth looking at everyday lives because they are in some ways extraordinary. Em and Dex aren’t world-beating heroes. But one thing that is so brilliant about the book is that it says what we do with those ordinary lives is as important as any kind of huge heroics.”Then there is the intimacy of the novel, the feeling that the book is speaking to you and only you, how do the team intend to recreate that? “We’re boarding over the Lyceum completely and making it as a round,” explains Webster with gusto. “The show will start and end at the Pear Tree pub in Edinburgh, where Em and Dex first meet on graduation night. The audience will be very close to us, with cabaret-style tables and chairs round the stage. So you’re really able to be in the room with Em and Dex as they share their days together.”The musical is premiering in Edinburgh for a reason: this is where Em and Dex’s story begins. Greig, who recently stepped down as artistic director of the Royal Lyceum, believes it’s the perfect place to begin this next chapter in Nicholls’s enduringly popular story: “Whenever you work on a musical, part of that creative process is the first moment of discovery in front of the audience – and I think the Edinburgh audience is going to be perfect. Perhaps a bit cheekily, they now think they own the story of One Day.”View image in fullscreenAffair exchange … Ambika Mod and Leo Woodall in the 2024 TV adaptation of One Day.Photograph: APThe decision to stage the show in Edinburgh is also a practical one, says Webster: “I think it’s really important that there are partnerships between subsidised and commercial work and that one of the models – as the government starts to cut the Arts Council funding – is that those collaborations work both ways. So I think that the craftspeople in Edinburgh – the costume, dramaturgy and producing departments at the Lyceum – are an amazing resource to the commercial team. And, of course, the commercial enhancement is amazing for an Arts Council-funded building. It’s all creating a synergy that is really important going forward.”One Day review – a flawless romcom you’ll fall for, hardRead moreWebster and Greig hope they are creating a show that theatre aficionados and One Day enthusiasts will love and admire. But they’re really staging this show for the Ems and Dexes out there, the unsung heroes “going about their normal lives, who want a really wonderful night out”. Greig is also writing with one specific person in mind: his wife. In one of life’s lovely little coincidences, the two first met in the year Nicholls’s novel begins.“Lucie and I got together in 1988. We went through the whole world of the novel together. She doesn’t really like theatre much,” Greig adds with a wry chuckle. “But that means that when she does like it I’m really happy. So this one is for Lucie and her female friends. I think they’re going to like it. I’m going to be so pissed off if they don’t.”One Day: The Musicalis atthe Royal Lyceum theatre, Edinburgh, 27 February to 19 April.Explore more on these topicsMusicalsDavid GreigDavid NichollsTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now his banging pop miniatures have been streamed nearly 30m times – and are making parents cryTim JonzeMon 16 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleI’m listening to the latest Stephen Spencer song when suddenly I burst into tears. Was it the falsetto vocals? The swirling harmonies? No, it was the lyrics: “What did Apple-the-Stoola say? He said ‘I love you’ twenty-sixty times.”Spencer, you see, has a unique lyrical collaborator: his three-year-old daughter. Over the last four months, he has been posting short songs online based on her stream-of-consciousness stories. There’s a smooth soul number about “a regular rabbit, who has regular ponytails just like me”. A song called Funchy the Snow-woman that could fit easily on to a 1975 album, but for its lyrical message about using a litter tray in the forest. And a festive tune about a Christmas cat called Harda Tarda, who hopes that Taja (“a funny way to say Santa”) will bring her “a doggy, a puppy and a ninja-bread man”.I think the songs resonate with the parents of children who miss the days when they were threeWhen he started posting his songs, Spencer had 36 followers. “They were really just for my mom and her book club.” He now has more than 250,000 and his songs have been listened to an astonishing 23m times on Instagram and 5m times on TikTok. There have been demands to turn these minute-long mini-masterpieces into full-length versions for an album. “I’m hesitant to try to stretch them in a way that might spoil the magic of those captured moments,” he says. But there are plans to release something in longer form. A Spotify release of Regular Rabbit is set for this week.On first listen, the songs are funny and cute, a welcome respite from the tumult in the world. But they’re also absolute bangers. Spencer – who was in a funk band at school in Ottawa and is now professor of composition and music theory at Hunter College in New York City – is incredibly adept at crafting hooks that won’t leave your head. But what about the crying? Because I really did not expect that.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

I’ve always had a sense of wanting to bottle it because I know it will disappear soon. Music is my way of doing that.”This makes sense. My daughter is nine now and, although she still writes charming stories, the surreal character names and dream-logic plotlines have been replaced by more sensible tropes. Hearing Spencer’s songs takes me straight back to that giddy toddler period.But is it more than nostalgia? Spencer, 35, has noticed another surprising response to his work. He’s aware of the inherent humour in the contrast between his daughter’s flights of fancy and his meticulous approach to performing them seriously: the way he turns to the camera to sing passionately about, say, a dinosaur called Pasghetti is reminiscent of Flight of the Conchords. “But what I didn’t realise,” he says, “is how that would land, for so many people, as an act of love. Listening really closely to a child, taking care in understanding, trying to get the words right, no judgment, no correcting – that turned out to be really moving for some people.”Indeed, fans love the fact that characters in the songsgoedsomewhere rather than went, orfliedinstead of flew. “Some people have said that the songs touch them because they were never deeply listened to as a child,” says Spencer.While listeners compare his work to yacht rock, Spencer says his influences are jazz and classicalThe comments under his songs on Instagram (@_stephenspencer) can be as moving as the music. Under the one about Apple-the-Stoola (an apple man who is granted wings by a fairy so he can fly away and find his lost mum), a listener has posted: “I wish I could still tell my Mom I love you twenty-sixty times. She ‘flied away’ nine years ago. So if you still have a mom that is in your life, tell her ‘I love you’ twenty-sixty times.”“There’s this tendency to interpret her words in a profound way,” says Spencer, who chooses not to give his daughter’s name. This is not entirely accidental. Spencer picks out phrases from the stories he thinks have the potential for deeper meaning and uses them for chorus refrains. In the Christmas cat song, Santa responds to present requests by saying: “I’ll give you everything.” Watching Spencer sing this, from the heart with his eyes closed, it’s clear that, although these are his daughter’s words, he’s really saying them back to her.It’s not his only clever musical trick. While listeners like to compare his work to yacht rock and other breezy 1970s genres, Spencer says his influences are jazz and classical. “In my theory classes, we often look at Beethoven. There might be a chord change in the development of a sonata where he will modulate to a foreign key. I try to use that same technique for my pre-choruses and bridges.”Has the growing audience added pressure and expectation to something that started out extremely pure? “I have to forget about that side, because what makes them work is how it’s about just hanging with my daughter and not taking life too seriously.”The songs normally come together over a couple of afternoons. Spencer will record her stories on his phone and, occasionally, go back for more details if he feels the verses need an extra syllable here or there. It’s a genuine artistic collaboration. So what does his lyricist make of the results? “It’s maybe a little disappointing as an answer,” he says, laughing, “but from what I can tell, she couldn’t care less. Let’s just say she’s more focused on the process than the product.”A true artist then! “Exactly. I’ve told her 20 million people have listened, but that’s not really a meaningful number to her. Put it like this: she thinks I’m seven.”Regular Rabbit (Living Room Version) is released on streaming platforms on 17 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsMusicChildrenParents and parentingFamilyPop and rockSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Actually, it’s only just over a year since Welch and her musical partnerDavid Rawlingswere last in Australia, when they played sold-out residencies at Melbourne’s Hamer Hall and the Sydney Opera House. This, though, is the Empire Theatre in Toowoomba, the heart of Queensland’s Bible belt.For this tour, Welch and Rawlings are road-tripping, taking in a few of the larger regional cities around the southern capitals. It’s not without commercial risk, because the 1,500-capacity Empire – a glorious heritage-listed art deco building dating back to 1911 – is barely half full. Maybe Toowoomba’s idea of country music hews closer to Tamworth’s.No one leaves unsatisfied, though. Without a new album to plug, the queen and king ofAmericanaare free to dive deep into their catalogue. Over two sets, the audience (a good chunk of which has travelled from Brisbane) is treated to songs the duo hasn’t played in years, alongside cuts from Woodland (released late in 2024), plus covers.They open with Orphan Girl – the spiritual song covered by Emmylou Harris before Welch recorded it herself for her debut album, Revival, released 30 years ago. Then they flash forward to the near-present, with the easy lilt of Woodland’s Empty Trainload of Sky followed by Rawlings’ song Cumberland Gap.View image in fullscreen‘The pair seem to function like one organism, with harmonies so close they can barely be delineated.’Photograph: Darren England/AAPThe stage setup is now familiar: a rug, two microphones, a table, sympathetic but minimal lighting, two ancient guitars and a banjo. When Welch dons her harmonica, Rawlings cracks that “you’ve seen all our tricks now” – at least until her thigh-slapping, tap-dancing turn for the Appalachian folk of Six White Horses.But the surprises are buried in the set. Rock of Ages, from Welch’s 1998 album Hell Among the Yearlings, comes early and is followed by the even more rarely performed Dear Someone, from 2001’s Time (The Revelator). Welch and Rawlings are mixing the material up well: travelling fans will be well satisfied.One of the benefits of Welch and Rawlings now finally working under both their names, instead of Welch’s alone, is that the songs released by Rawlings (Cumberland Gap, Ruby, Airplane) now feel better integrated into the set. We’re also more used to Rawlings singing lead (on What We Had, Hashtag and Guy Clark’s Desperados Waiting for a Train).Americana icon Gillian Welch: ‘Bob Dylan walking on to our version of Billy put a smile on my face’Read moreMore often, though, the pair seem to function like one organism, with harmonies so close they can barely be delineated. Often, the music appears to be not just playing, but shaking the life out of them – Welch instinctively following Rawlings as he unspools long, winding solos that colour well outside the lines of the recorded songs.This is music for hard times, with songs populated by characters at their wits’ end or worse. But there is almost always hope: even The Way It Goes, which features a junkie, a jailbird and at least two funerals in its five verses, sees the circle of life continue: “Everybody’s buying little baby clothes,” Welch croons over a galloping rhythm.The lyrics tread a fine line between narrative and abstraction, allowing enough space for listeners to graft their own stories on to these classic folk tales. The Bells and the Birds, a deep cut from Woodland, is three minutes of pinging harmonics and haunted vocals about how no one hears things in quite the same way: “Some hear a song, some hear a warning.”At the end of their second encore, they walk to the lip of the stage and deliver a hushed rendition of Lefty Frizzell’s country standard Long Black Veil, sans microphones – briefly turning the Empire into a house concert. It’s a literal show-stopper, leaving the crowd to float out into the chilly night air.Gillian Welch and David Rawlings are touring Australia until 1 March;see here for all datesExplore more on these topicsMusicGillian WelchDavid RawlingsAmericanaQueenslandlive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

The platform is now host to reams of content that violate its own guidelines.According to developers who spoke with the Guardian, abuse – particularly directed towards transgender creators – is a fact of life on the platform. “Everyone is at one another’s throats all the time in reviews, discussions, forums, anywhere you can possibly find it on Steam,” says content creator and Steam curator Bri “BlondePizza” Moore. “It ensures no one is safe on the platform; developers and consumers alike.”Aside from the content of Steam’s forums, sources pointed to two main causes for concern: bigoted reviews posted on games’ Steam pages, which can hugely affect sales for their developers; and Steam curators (self-appointed taste-makers on the platform) directing campaigns against games they perceive to lean left or pursue inclusion.“I’m not new to online harassment,” says designer Nathalie Lawhead, who spent two years trying to get reviews removed from their games’ pages.Bothreferenceallegations of sexual assaultthat Lawhead made in 2019. “I assumed reporting Steam abuse might have its own issues. But when people suggested that I open a ticket, I did have hope that this would be the way to get it resolved.”Valve’s refusal to moderate is making Steam reviews and forums the battleground for a culture warÉmi Lefèvre, Studio Plane ToastOne of the reviews, published in 2023, read, “cringe game, made by a liar”. The other, a review of Lawhead’s game Blue Suburbia posted in 2024, said: “A women [sic] who seeks to destroy other’s [sic] career made this. It’s very poorly put together. She also probably has dual Israeli citizenship with how pointy her nose is.”Despite Steam’scode of online conductandcommunity guidelinesprohibiting “abusive language or insults”, public accusations or “discrimination”, moderators initially cleared both reviews after Lawhead reported them.View image in fullscreenA ‘No Woke’ curation list on Steam, where reviewers target games with LGBTQ+ characters.Photograph: SteamSteam does not allow cleared content to be reported again by the same user unless it has been edited. So Lawhead asked others on social media to report the reviews, which prompted Steam to remove the antisemitic example. The other, however, was passed again. “We aren’t in a position to verify the accuracy of statements made in user reviews,” reads a response from Steamsent on 9 January 2026, “and we don’t try to moderate reviews based on accuracy.” Removing reviews, the response claimed, could be seen as “censorship”.“Crushing,” is how Lawhead describes Steam’s missive. “The implication seems to be that I must prove my sexual assault [to Steam] if I want to be protected from harassment over it,” they say. “I am hard-pressed to see where the misunderstanding might be. They had all the information regarding the situation. It’s an obvious stance. It’s a choice.”The remaining review was finally removed, but only after Lawhead personally approached an employee of Steam’s developer, Valve, outside the moderation ecosystem. “This was too much work just for two obviously unjustifiable reviews,” they say, describing having to resolve the issue outside the usual channels as awkward for both parties. “I think this entire process of moderation is broken.”While Lawhead was able to call on public support to help get reviews removed, that is not an option for every developer: not everyone has enough of a following. Others who have gone public with Steam moderation issues have received further harassment, and have asked to speak anonymously or be identified by their first names only.View image in fullscreenCaravan SandWitch, criticised as ‘Too LGBTQ’ in one review.Photograph: Studio Plane ToastSome games have been targeted by Steam curators. Ethan, the developer ofCoven, a first-person action-horror set in the 1600s, says he has been targeted by “CharlieTweetsDetected”, a curator devoted to recommending games based solely on whether their developers are perceived to have correctly mourned the assassination of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk.CharlieTweetsDetected’s review of Coven, a first-person action-horror game set in the 1600s, read simply “Celebrated Sept 10th on blue sky [sic]”. This encouraged others to post further reviews and comments related to Kirk (and not the game). “I even mentioned it to Steam support,” Ethan says, “how it stemmed from that curator list, but they weren’t interested.” Instead, Steam support claimed that “off-topic” constituted “a recipe for cookies, or something completely unrelated to video games that is clearly trolling.” Reviews referencing Kirk, including one reading simply “RIP Charlie Kirk” alongside a negative rating, did not fit that criteria according to Steam;all remain in place today.Elsewhere, campaigns chase games that include trans or LGBTQ+ characters. A trans developer included on acuration list titled “NO WOKE”cites frequent discussion threads, including one that referred to them as a “transvestite” and asked whether their game included “woke faggotry.” Plane Toast’s Émi Lefèvre points toreviewsand discussionsof Caravan SandWitch, a sci-fi action-adventure and driving game, which frequently approach its queer characters negatively. “Too LBGTQ [sic] … There is no future or continuation for these sad gays and lesbians,”reads oneamong many that remain visible on the game’s store page.“For sure, the ‘anti-woke’ curators brought insincere negative attention to the game,” Lefèvre says. “Valve’s refusal to moderate any of this is making Steam reviews and forums the battleground for some kind of culture war, and is making them unsafe for marginalised people and regular gamers trying to simply enjoy the game they bought.”‘Brown space lesbians’ ended up the hardest line in our marketing copyChristina Pollock, developer of Ambrosia SkyThanks to this influx of bad actors, and the lengths that developers need to go to in the hopes of getting hateful content removed from their pages, often without success, many report feeling held hostage by the platform. Steam has becomeessential for developers. It brings in millions of daily users – last monthit had almost 42 million concurrent players– and billions of dollars. “No other storefront has the clout that Steam does,” Lawhead says. “Publishers don’t take you seriously if you’re not on it.”That level of success results inhundreds of thousands of support ticketsevery week. Details about how Valve, a company that hasbeen reported to employ fewer than 400 people, handles its moderation load are elusive. Online consensus, including amongthose formerly involved in Steam’s volunteer moderation programme(retired in 2022), is that the process must be outsourced. The Guardian reached out to Valve on multiple occasions, through multiple channels, for more information and for comment on why moderators clear so many apparent violations of Steam’s guidelines. Valve did not respond to those requests, nor has it made any public comment that the Guardian could find on Steam’s moderation issues.Developer Phi endured an identical process to Ethan and Lawhead upon releasing Heart of Enya in 2021. After escalating a support ticket overtransphobic reviews, Phi received the following response from a Steam agent: “It’s much better to continue working on the product, while letting the community use the helpfulness feature to surface reviews that they agree with or find to be uninformed.” (This exact wording was in Steam support’s response to Lawhead five years later.) “Most of our moderating decisions come down to a yes/no criteria … that’s a frustrating line to walk, and I think it inevitably leaves content that would be considered offensive.”The agent suggested the issue would be discussed with their team, but after five years little appears to have changed.View image in fullscreenTying to contain a fungal outbreak … Ambrosia Sky.Photograph: Soft Rains“To us, it seemed that in Steam’s [view], hateful comments about an individual is abuse – but targeting it towards a group of people is totally fine, that’s welcome speech,” Phi says. “We had no other choice for what to do about transphobia in our reviews. They’re still up there today.”Recourse for developers is limited. Some are looking into their own security, shoring up protections for developers on their team against being doxxed or hacked by trolls. Or, in the case of the developers of Caves of Qud, paying their own moderators to handle forums and the hate that spills out of Steam. Others push bigoted comments into public view in an attempt to cajole Valve, such as No More Robots head Mike Rose, whopushed back against racist reviews of its game Little Rocket Lablast year. “Woke game. Also has muslims,” reads one negative review; “please never, ever play any of our games ever again,” reads Rose’s response.Others are just trying to roll with it. “Brown space lesbians trying and failing to contain a simple fungal outbreak” is, despite its original derogatory intent, “the hardest line in all of our marketing copy”, according toAmbrosia Skydeveloper Christina Pollock.It is increasingly easy, however, for the average consumer to log on to Steam and encounter abuse, bigotry and hate, much of which has been cleared by moderators. And because reviews affect a game’s visibility on Steam, a single negative rating can mean the difference between success and failure. Lax moderation doesn’t just create individual harm but has profound professional and economic implications for developers across the platform.Many of them say they feel forced simply to endure it – unable to walk away from Steam’s near-monopoly onPCgaming. “If I am to continue existing on Steam, I am under the impression that I will have to go through this exhausting ordeal every time I want to report abuse,” Lawhead concludes. “This shouldn’t be normal.”Explore more on these topicsSteamPCGamesRaceLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No entry? I wonder as I step tentatively into the gallery. The word appears again and again – always painted in red – across the large sheet of fabric that divides the first gallery space. Later, it decorates Delaine Le Bas’s skirt in a photograph in which she stands in a field, holding a placard that states: “No state control.”View image in fullscreenDelaine Le Bas, No State Control, photographed in Findon, West Sussex (after Horace Poolaw’s Trecil Poolaw Unap, Mountain View, Oklahoma, 1929).Photograph: Lincoln Cato/Courtesy the artistsIt could seem unwelcoming, but printed amid the prevailing colours of pink, blue and yellow, repeating like a catchy pop song, it does something else. “It is ‘no’ as an affirmation,” says Le Bas. “It is like, ‘No, then, we mustn’t let them steal our joy.’” It’s a shout of protection, like a child stubbornly refusing to relinquish something precious. The “no” is not directed at us, but beyond us, creating a boundary that suspends reality for a moment and cocoons the viewer in layers of soft fabric and folklore.Un-Fair-Ground establishes a space where a spirit of generosity and warmth allows difficult questions to be asked about land, art ownership and identity. Le Bas – who was a 2024 Turner prize nominee – is shaped by her Romany heritage and keenly aware of the ways in which structures created to “protect” one thing can be weaponised to exclude another. In Un-Fair-Ground she flips the narrative, so the protected heritage is her own, as she takes 20 pieces from the Whitworth’s collection to serve her story.Le Bas’s ability to welcome and interrogate in unison comes to fruition in Witch House, a new installation that expands on her2009 work, Witch Hunt. Down a painted cobbled street, we enter an inviting home with hand-sewn Serbian shoes in the centre and dappled light falling through the calico-draped roof. On the walls is a vibrant wallpaper, created by Le Bas in honour of the Whitworth’s wallpaper collection, one of the largest in the world.“Meet your neighbours”, the wallpaper advises, as photos of Le Bas as a child mingle with illustrations of Delaine and her late husband, Damian, cutouts of dolls, union flags and cartoons. There’s the text of a Conservative party policy request to repeal the Human Rights Act in a way detrimental to Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people. At points, works by William Blake, Joan Miró and Paula Rego from the Whitworth’s collection literally tear through the wallpaper.View image in fullscreenDelaine Le Bas, L’Archipel en Feu/The Archipelago on Fire.Photograph: Alexander Christie/Courtesy the artist / Alexander ChristieThis scrambling of the usual hierarchies employed when displaying art creates connections elsewhere in the show. In L’Archipel en Feu – a triptych of hand-stitched and hand-painted fabrics – animals, nature and bodies blend. A rabbit hops through vibrant, cellophane flowers; a shadowy woman throws the moon; a horse’s head sits atop a female body. In Delainia: 17071965 Unfolding, a video work projected on to pieces of thin fabric and a large circular mirror, figures move in and out of colourful textiles, while the footage skips to shots of a forest. This kaleidoscope of images exposes the fragmented way in which all human narratives are constructed.In contrast to the rest of the rainbow proceedings, the final gallery space is muted, the walls draped in magnolia calico. Most of the works in this space are not by Le Bas; they include pieces by Brazilian sculptor Ana Maria Pacheco,“outsider artist” Madge Gilland Damian Le Bas. The presentation of the works on fabric instead of solid wall generates a feeling of temporality, as if we are only gathered here for a moment. It is curious, especially with Pacheco’s sinister figures smirking out of The Endeavours of a Certain Poet, but I wonder where all the joy has gone. Even Le Bas’s works in this room take on a different spirit; her palette is monochrome and her paint is thick and heavy; fabric hands reach out from the edges of the calico walls like spectres trying to pull us in.View image in fullscreenDelaine Le Bas, Un-Fair-Ground installation at the Whitworth.Photograph: Michael Pollard/© The Whitworth, The University of ManchesterThe exhibition is named after the artist’s mural, Un-Fair-Ground, which is now in the hallway at the Whitworth. It was originally exhibited at the Unfairground area at Glastonbury festival in 2024, and takes visual elements of a fairground – cartoons, clowns and bold colours – and mixes them with stars, eyes, ears, the female form, creatures, iconography and Greek mythology. At the top is a huge, golden sun, shimmering ethereally under the Whitworth lights. This isn’t Un Fair Ground, a place where all is fair, but an Un-Fair-Ground, where ground is neither fair nor unfair, but just a space for connection – and a glorious, defiant welcome.Delaine Le Bas: Un-Fair-Ground is at theWhitworth, Manchesteruntil 31 MayExplore more on these topicsArtPaintingSculptureInstallationreviewsShareReuse this content"

Together they represent a world of exotic aromas, from amber and musk to ginger and saffron. But given that I have left the grey British winter behind to come here, I am more interested in capturing the sunny essence of the Côte d’Azur.Here in the hills north of Cannes, the colours pop: hillsides are full of bright yellow mimosa flowers, violets are peeping out of flowerbeds and oranges hang heavy on branches over garden walls, even though it’s not yet spring. It is the perfect antidote to the gloom back home, and the chance to bottle these very scents is a joy.View image in fullscreenOver the next two hours, with the help of perfumery expert Manon Zamoun, I blend my own perfume that I name “Mimosa trail”. The scents (natural essences or synthetic aromas), are set out on three shelves, the top shelf for the high notes, the bottom for base notes, with the heart notes in between. I sniff, blend and decant; it’s the most rewarding chemistry lesson of my life.The bottles’ labels are turned away from me so my choices are led by my nose not my brain. I’m surprised to find I liked parma violets and patchouli, while rose d’orient and fleurs de lilas don’t make the cut.Galimard is Grasse’s oldest perfume house, established in 1747. The trade grew out of the town’s leather tanning industry; with scents created to cover the pong, it became the “perfume capital of the world”. Its other two famous perfume houses, Molinard and Fragonard, opened in 1849 and 1926 respectively, later joined by big names such as Dior, Guérlain and Chanel.But beyond perfume, Grasse is a delight to wander – a maze of yellow-hued streets, overlooked by towering palm trees and, today at least, a welcome blue sky, though there’s still a little chill in the air. I take comfort in the fact it’s 10 degrees warmer than it is back home because I’m here to fast-forward spring with a short road trip between the lesser-known villages and towns of the Côte d’Azur.View image in fullscreenGrasse, where the perfume industry developed initially to cover the smell of the town’s leather tanning trade.Photograph: StockByM/Getty ImagesEn route to Grasse, I’d stopped at Tourrettes-sur-Loup for another of the region’s flowers: violets. When seen from the south, the village is a jumble of terracotta-roofed houses clinging to a clifftop. It’s known for its tradition of growing the small, purple blooms, and has supplied the perfume industry since Queen Victoria visited in the late 19th century while wintering in Nice, 18 miles (30km) south west of here. The queen gave her name to the variety that was, in her day, cultivated by 40 families in Tourrettes and, thanks to its long stalk, was traditionally given in small posies between Christmas and Valentine’s Day.Producers have turned the delicate flavour of mimosa into jams and cordials, and its scent into candles and soapsAtLa Bastide aux Violettes, a small museum on the outskirts of the village, I discover more about the flower and its history, and inhale its sweet, delicate scent in the greenhouse, where they grow in vertical columns. There are now only three producers, includingJérôme Coche and his family, who turn the petals into products such as crystalised violet sweets. The village still celebrates the end of the season withLa Fête des Violettesin late February/early March, which attracts about 12,000 people (some on coach trips from Italy) with carnival floats, dancing, music and a flower and produce market.Out of season the village is quieter, awaiting the summer crowds. Wine bar-restaurantLa Cave de Tourrettesis buzzing with life though, even on a wet Wednesday evening, and my two-course meal is a superb beef tartare with grana padano, caper berries and cornichons, followed by pork filet mignon and orange-scented sweet potato with braised leeks (mains from €25.50). The next morning, the sky is a blaze of blue and I eat breakfast on the balcony ofmy townhouse apartment, with a lovely view of the valley towards the Mediterranean.View image in fullscreenA cafe in Mandelieu-la-Napoule decorated with mimosas.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyThe sun is also shining in Mandelieu-la-Napoule, on the coast, my last stop. Mimosas were just starting to come into bloom on the dramatic route between Tourrettes and the village of Gourdon, which winds through the Gorge du Loup, with its waterfalls, tunnels and steep cliffs – but down on the coast, spring has really sprung.La Route du Mimosais a trail through the most impressive blooms, covering 80 miles from Bormes-les-Mimosas to Grasse. Around the town of Mandelieu-la-Napoule – which hosts theFête du Mimosa, a weekend of celebrations to mark the start of the season in February – there are group hikes into the hills organised by the tourist office, as well as farms to visit and shops where producers have turned its delicate flavour into jams and cordials, and its scent into candles and soaps.For a thrilling ride and to gain some local knowledge I’ve booked a three-hour tour withLa Grande Vadrouille(€160 for one or two). Local guide Daniel Saffioti welcomes me to ride in the side-car of his Chang Jiang Pekin Express motorbike. Daniel knows all the best routes from Mandelieu to Tanneron, a town farther inland where you find mimosas in abundance. After donning my helmet and sunglasses, we set off along the coast road, La Corniche d’Or.Along La Route du Mimosa, mimosas burst between palm trees and over the garden walls of luxurious villasThis sinuous route southward to the Cap d’Esterel offers astonishing views of Cannes and its backdrop, the snow-capped Mercantour mountains of the Alpes-Maritimes. Along the road, mimosas burst between palm trees and over the garden walls of luxurious villasWe double back toward Mandelieu, and then motor on into the hills, stopping for a rest just outside Tanneron, where the landscape is a tapestry of olive groves, eucalyptus trees and lavender fields awaiting their summer blooms. A closer inspection of a mimosa tree allows me to breath in its delicate scent and see its fern-like leaves and tiny flowers up close – like little yellow pompoms electrified by the sunshine. Daniel tells me how they were introduced by the British, having been brought from Australia (they are a kind of acacia) and how council workers work hard to keep them from taking over the landscape and roadsides, such is their propensity to thrive in the Provençal climate.Our tour finishes in Mandelieu and after bidding Daniel farewell, I sit on the terrace of theBiskotacafe for lunch and a mimosa-infused lemonade. In the evening is the opening of theFête du Mimosa. Gingham-clothed tables and benches are laid out for locals to sit and drink wine and street performers, some on stilts, dance through the crowds. Tomorrow there will be floats adorned with flowers, but tonight a firework display shoots up over the crenellated walls of the waterside chateau. I breath in the sulphurous tang that hangs in the air; it may not be the floral scent of spring, but it doesn’t matter – I’ve got a bottle of that in my bag.The trip was provided byCôte d’Azur Tourism and Mandelieu-La-Napoule Tourism.La Borgardain Tourrettes-sur-Loup has a one-bedroom apartment from€195 a night and a three-bedroom townhouse from €330 a night.

The texture is fantastic and, whisper it, they’re even better made in an air fryer. Yes, I finally got one and it’s fantastic. You do, however, have to cook them all in one layer, which, depending on the size of your air-fryer basket, might mean cooking them in multiple batches. It feels more efficient to make them all in one go, though, so I’ve provided oven timings below.Ginger sesame meatballs with rice and greensUse your favourite and the best-quality mince you can get – it makes a big difference to the flavour and feels like a real treat.Prep15 minCook25 minServes44cmpiece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated2garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated3 spring onions, trimmed and roughly chopped2tbsp sesame seeds10g coriander, leaves and tender stems50g freshwhite breadcrumbs(I just blitz whatever bread we have in)500gmince(chicken, lamb or vegan)1egg1tsp sea salt flakes2tbsp sesame oil3 pak choi, cut into quarters200g basmati rice400ml boiling waterFor the dressing100g smooth or crunchy peanut butter2tbsp soy sauce2tbsp rice-wine vinegar2 smallgarlic cloves, peeled and finely grated2cm piece ginger, peeled and finely grated1 small red chilli, finely choppedTip the ginger, garlic, spring onions, sesame seeds, coriander and breadcrumbs into a food processor and blitz to a rough paste. Add the mince, egg and salt, and blitz again briefly until evenly incorporated. (Alternatively, finely chop the spring onions and coriander by hand, then mix everything in a large bowl.)Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Divide and shape the meatball mixture into just larger than walnut-in-the-shell-sized balls, and transfer to a large roasting tin. Drizzle with half the sesame oil and gently turn the meatballs so they get coated in the oil. Dress the pak choi with the remaining oil, then arrange in between the meatballs – you want the meatballs on top, so they brown. Bake for 25 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through.Meanwhile, put the rice and boiling water in a microwaveable bowl (I use a large Pyrex one), cover with a tight-fitting lid or a snug plate, and cook in a microwave on a medium heat (in mine, it’s 600W out of a maximum 800W) for 11 minutes, then leave to stand for 10 minutes.Whisk all the dressing ingredients in a bowl, using a couple of tablespoons of water to loosen, if need be. Taste and adjust the soy and vinegar as needed, and set aside.Serve the meatballs, pak choi and rice hot, with the sauce alongside.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyMain courseDairy-freeChickenHerbs and spicesrecipesShareReuse this content"

This dish takes the classic elements of a puttanesca – that is, anchovies, capers, olives, tomatoes – and combines them into a rich sauce for gnocchi, which are then covered in mozzarella, breadcrumbs and parmesan, and flashed under the grill. It’s exactly what you want on a rainy night. In fact, my sauce-averse toddler thought it smelled so good that she stole half of my plate – a win all round. (Although her pretty decent suggestion was that next time I use it as a pizza sauce, rather than on pasta or gnocchi. Noted.)Crispy baked gnocchi puttanescaI’ve non-canonically added in small cubes of aubergine, because they melt beautifully into the sauce while adding extra plant matter. To make this vegetarian, omit the anchovies, add an extra spoon of capers and use a vegetarian parmesan.Prep15 minCook30 minServes2 adults and2 small children2tbsp olive oil1 onion, peeled and finely chopped1 medium aubergine, trimmed and cut into 1cm dice½tsp flaky sea salt2garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated2tsp small capers in brine, drained1tsp anchovies in oil(about five small fillets)75g black olives, drained400g tinned chopped tomatoes500g fresh chilled or vacuum-packed gnocchi150g ball mozzarella, roughly torn40g white or panko breadcrumbs40g parmesanHeat the oil in a large, ovenproof frying pan or casserole, then add the onion and stir-fry on a medium to high heat for five minutes, until just starting to soften. Add the aubergine and salt, and cook, stirring frequently, for a further 10 minutes, until the aubergine has started to soften and brown.Add the garlic, capers, anchovies and olives, and stir-fry for 30 seconds, mashing the anchovies well. Add the tinned tomatoes, bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. (Note: it helps to use a good brand of tinned tomatoes here – Mutti’s are fantastic. Other brands may take a little longer to thicken sufficiently.)Just before the sauce is ready, bring a large pan of water to a boil, then drop in the gnocchi and cook according to the packet instructions (usually on a rolling boil for two to three minutes). Drain well, then stir the gnocchi through the sauce.Heat the grill to medium-high. Scatter the mozzarella all over the gnocchi. Mix the breadcrumbs and parmesan in a bowl, then scatter this over the mozzarella. Grill for three to five minutes, until the cheese has melted and the breadcrumbs and parmesan are well-browned, then serve hot.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyPastaMain courseTomatoesCheeseItalian food and drinkVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"
