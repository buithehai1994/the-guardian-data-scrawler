As people retreat into paddling pools and beneath the breeze of pedestal fans, a quieter and less visible struggle is playing out across the country’s fields, forests and hedgerows. So how are Britain’s animals weathering the heat?From cows and cats to herons, horses and even earthworms, each species has evolved its own tactics for staying cool – some more effective than others. But as extreme heat events become more frequent and intense, scientists are beginning to question the longer-term resilience of UK wildlife, and what we can do to help.Unlike humans, most species have not evolved the ability to sweat. But dogs pant – as do some birds, including blackbirds. Others, including pigeons and herons, rapidly vibrate the bones and muscles in their throats to expose moist membranes to the air and dissipate heat, a technique called gular fluttering.Earthworms seek refuge deep underground and “aestivate” – slowing down their metabolisms and sleeping out hot, dry periods. Snails aestivate in their shells.Squirrels “sploot”– splaying themselves out in a pancake posture to dump heat into the ground. And although cats do not sweat through their skin, they can do so through their paw pads. They also lick their paws and fur to enhance cooling.View image in fullscreenA squirrel splooting on a branch. This pancake posture is used to dump heat into the ground.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PASuch strategies can be costly though. “Some animals exhibit behaviours like panting when they go into heat stress, which is an important way for the body to try and regulate itself. But if you’re panting, it’s harder to pick up food and feed yourself adequately,”said Prof Alex Thornton at the University of Exeter. “Lots of animals will go and hide in the shade, which might save them from some of the bad effects of the heat, but it also means they’re not out finding food or mates, which can have negative consequences if that heat is prolonged.”High temperatures also make animals – and humans – temporarily more stupid. “Just as if I asked you to do an exam and I cranked up the thermostat to 40 degrees, you’d probably do a lot worse than you might otherwise, we find similar sorts of things in animals,” said Thornton. “I’ve been doing work with Australian colleagues on some desert animals, where we can show that even in wild conditions, if they’re heat stressed their cognitive performance really drops. That’s a big problem because animals use their cognitive abilities to deal with environmental change, to track food, and so on.”View image in fullscreenHigh temperatures inhibit the growth of new neurons in a fruit fly’s brain.Photograph: vasekk/Getty Images/iStockphotoEvidence from laboratory creatures suggests there may be developmental consequences too. For instance, in fruit flies, high temperatures inhibit the growth of new neurons in the brain. “If baby flies grow up under very high heat, they end up with smaller mushroom bodies – the part of the insect brain that controls learning,” said Thornton. In humans too, evidence increasingly suggests thatprolonged exposureto temperatures above 30C during pregnancy or early life can affect the growth of foetuses and infants up to the age of two.Prolonged heat stress can reduce farm animals’ fertility and increase susceptibility to disease. Cattle are particularly affected by heat.“Our northern European-bred cattle are very happy in cooler temperatures. But when they are hot, we notice this bunching behaviour, where they stand very close together,” said Dr Zoe Barker, an agricultural scientist at the University of Reading.One theory is that bunching in the shade helps them to stay cool – but indoor-housed cattle do it too. Another is that they are bunching towards better ventilation or trying to protect themselves from flies. Alternatively, “they could have got so stressed, that their herd instinct is to bunch together”, said Barker.She and colleagues at the universities of Essex, Cardiff and Anglia Ruskin are studying this phenomenon, because it does not seem to be very good for cattle. “When they bunch, the individual animals get warmer because you’ve got these massive radiators sticking themselves next to one another, and they create a lot of moisture,” said Barker.View image in fullscreenCows finding shade beneath a tree on Dartmoor. Scientists are yet to discover why they bunch in heat.Photograph: Paul Mansfield Photography/Getty Images“Because they don’t use the barn area fully, the areas that they lie in can become wetter and dirtier, which increases their chance of getting mastitis [an udder infection]. They also spend more time standing, which has consequences for their feet, legs and lameness scores.”So far, the researchers have learned that bunching in barn-housed dairy herds starts to occur once the hourly ambient temperaturerises above about 20C(68F).The most productive cows are often worst affected by high temperatures, because milk production is a metabolically intense process that generates body heat. Prolonged heatwaves can reduce their milk yield, with economic consequences for farmers.Other large mammals also suffer in the heat. “A horse is six to seven times heavier than a human, but only has two times more skin surface, so it has a lower surface area to exchange heat into the environment. This means they can accumulate temperature quite quickly, particularly when exercising,” said Dr Roberta Blake, a veterinary surgeon and animal biomechanics expert at Anglia Ruskin in Writtle, Essex.Although horses can sweat to cool down, this is not always enough. A quirky, yet serious, sign of an excessively hot horse is “thumps” – the equine equivalent of hiccups – thought to be triggered by an electrolyte imbalance. If a horse is exhibiting this or other signs of heatstroke, dousing them in cool water is the best approach.View image in fullscreenDousing a horse in cool water can help them avoid heatstroke.Photograph: David Hartley/ShutterstockWith extreme heat events predicted to become more common as the century progresses, agricultural scientists are increasingly turning their minds to how to mitigate its effects, for example through improved building design.Helping wild animal populations will be harder, and there could be more mass casualty events as a result, such asswifts falling from the sky, as they did during the May 2022 heatwave, or thedeaths of large numbers of fishin oceans, lakes or rivers.But there are simple ways to help garden wildlife. Leaving patches of long grass and flowers offers shade and shelter, while a bird bath provides vital water. “Providing food has pros and cons, but we know that animals may find it more difficult to find enough food when it’s really hot, so there might be circumstances where it’s useful, such as providing bird feeders, and so on,” said Thornton.As heatwaves intensify, the fate of Britain’s wildlife may depend not just on their instincts, but on our willingness to step in and help.View image in fullscreenA female blackbird spreading its wings and gular fluttering to keep cool.Photograph: Robert Macdonald/AlamySunscreen for cats and other ways to help pets beat the heatIf you are slathering sunscreen on your own nose and ears, spare a thought for sun-loving pets. The RSPCA is urging cat owners to use pet-safe, waterproof SPF30+ on ear tips, noses and other areas with thin or no fur.Cats, like humans, can develop skin cancer – sometimes requiring surgery. Horses with white markings, and light-skinned or thin-coated dogs are also at risk.Avoid sunscreens with zinc oxide or salicylates, which are toxic to cats. And while unscented children’s sunscreens may be acceptable alternatives to pet-specific formulations, always check with a vet first.Other strategies to keep pets safe include providing plenty of water, shade, and time indoors during peak heat (usually 10am to 3pm). A parasol or draped sheet can offer shade in bare gardens.View image in fullscreenOwners are urged to apply pet-safe sunscreen to their cats.Photograph: Nils Jacobi/Getty Images/iStockphotoCats can be fussy about water placement. “Owners often put food and water bowls next to each other, because that’s how people eat and drink – but cats like to eat and drink in separate locations,” said Nicky Trevorrow, the senior behaviour manager at Cats Protection. “We think it goes back to African wildcat behaviour, and not wanting to contaminate their water source with the gut contents of their prey.”Many also prefer to drink with their backs to a wall, and favour wide, shallow bowls to avoid whisker contact, and glass or ceramic bowls over plastic or metal, which can alter the taste.To keep pets cool, try placing a frozen water bottle wrapped in a towel near their bed, and use a quiet fan to improve airflow.Pets with dirty rear ends are at risk offlystrike– a painful, sometimes fatal condition where maggots hatch and eat flesh. But even clean pets are not immune. In warm weather, the RSPCA advises twice-daily checks for illness or injury, daily cleaning of toilet areas, and keeping rear ends clean and dry.Explore more on these topicsAnimal behaviourAnimalsPetsExtreme weatherBiologyInvertebratesDogsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump can command the gaze of the world at a click of those famouslyshort fingers. When he stages a spectacular made-for-TV moment – say, thatOval Office showdownwith Volodymyr Zelenskyy – the entire planet sits up and takes notice.But that dominance has a curious side-effect. When Trump does something awful and eye-catching, nations tremble and markets move. But when he does something awful but unflashy, it scarcely registers. So long as there’s no jaw-dropping video, no expletive-ridden soundbite, no gimmick or stunt, it can slip by as if it hadn’t happened. Especially now that our senses are dulled through over-stimulation. These days it requires ever more shocking behaviour by the US president to prompt a reaction; we are becoming inured to him. Yet the danger he poses is as sharp as ever.Consider the events of just the last week or so, few of them stark enough to lead global news bulletins, yet each one another step towards the erosion of democracy in and by the world’s most powerful country.On Wednesday, Trump threatened toimpose 50% tariffs– yes, he’s climbed back on that dead horse – on Brazil, if the judicial authorities there do notdrop the prosecutionof the country’s Trump-like former president Jair Bolsonaro, charged with seeking to overturn his 2022 election defeat and leading a coup against the man who beat him, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. As concisely as he could manage, Lula explained,via social media, that Brazil is a sovereign country and thatan independent judiciary cannot“accept interference or instruction from anyone … No one is above the law.”This is becoming a habit of Trump’s. He made the same move in defence of Benjamin Netanyahu last month, hinting that Israel couldlose billions in US military aidif the prime minister continues to stand trial on corruption charges. In both cases, Trump was explicit in making the connection between the accused men and himself, decrying as a “witch-hunt” the efforts to hold them to account. “This is nothing more, or less, than an attack on a Political Opponent,” he posted, of Bolsonaro’s legal woes. “Something I know much about!”It’s easy to make light of the transparent effort by Trump to forge an international trade union of populist would-be autocrats, but he’s not solely moved by fraternal solidarity. He also wants to dismantle a norm that has long applied across the democratic world, which insists that even those at the top are subject to the law. That norm is an impediment to him, a check on his power. If he can discredit it, so that a new convention arises – one that agrees that leaders can act with impunity – that helps his animating project in the US: the amassing of ever more power to himself and the weakening or elimination of any rival source of authority that might act as a restraint.He is being quietly assisted in that goal by those US institutions that should regard themselves as co-equal branches of government – Congress and the supreme court – and whose constitutional duty is to stand up to an overmighty executive. Republicans in Congress have nowapproved a mega billthat they know will leave future generations of Americans drowning in debt and deprive millions of basic healthcare cover. Even so, they put aside their own judgment and bowed to the man who would be king.Less discussed was the bill’sextraordinary expansionof US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Ice. Its budget has been increased by a reported 308%, withan extra $45bnto spend on detention and $29.9bn for “enforcement and deportation”. It will soon have the capacity to detainnearly 120,000 peopleat any one time. And, remember, latest figures show that about half of all those detained by Ice haveno criminal recordat all.No wonder even conservative critics are sounding the alarm. The anti-Trump Republicans of the Bulwark warn that within months, the“national brute squad”that is Ice will have twice as many agents as the FBI and its own vast prison system, emerging as “the primary instrument of internal state power”. In this view, Trump has realised that corrupting the FBI is a tall order – though still worth trying – so he is supplanting it with a shadow force shaped in his own image. As the Bulwark puts it: “The American police state is here.”Those most directly threatened might share clips of masked Ice agents snatching suspected migrants off the streets and manhandling them violently, just as reports circulate of appalling conditions in Ice premises, with people held in “dungeon-like facilities”, more than 100 crammed into a small room, denied showers or a chance to change clothes, and sometimes given only one meal a day andforced tosleep on concrete benches or the floor. But it is hardly a matter of national focus. Because it is not accompanied by a neon-lit Trump performance, it is happening just out of view.The same could be said of a series of recent decisions by the supreme court. They may lack the instant, blockbuster impact of past rulings, but they accelerate the same Trump trend away from democracy and towards autocracy.On Tuesday, the judgesgave Trump the green lightto fire federal workers en masse and to dismantle entire government agencies without the approval of Congress. Earlier, the supreme court had ruled that Trump wasallowed to remove Democratsfrom the leadership of government bodies that are meant to be under politically balanced supervision.More usefully still for Trump, last month the judges limited the power of the lower courts to block the executive branch, therebylending a helping handto one of the president’s most egregious executive orders: his ending of the principle that anyone born in the US is automatically a citizen of the US, a right so fundamental it is enshrined in the constitution. In ruling after ruling, the supreme court is removing restraints on Trump andhanding him even more power. Small wonder that when one of the dissenting minority on the court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, was asked on Thursday what kept her up at night,she answered: “The state of our democracy.”Meanwhile, Trump is succeeding in his goal of cowing the press, extracting serious cash from major news organisations in return for dropping (usually flimsy) lawsuits against them, a move that is having thedesired, chilling effect.It all adds up to the steady erosion of US democracy and of democratic norms whose reach once extended far beyond US shores. Even if it is happening quietly, by Trump’s standards, without the familiar sound and fury, it is still happening. The work of opposing it begins with noticing it.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS supreme courtUS CongressUS politicsMigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

You are live to the nation. Please do not swear. Yes, it’s the show that changed the face of British TV. On 18 July, it’s exactly 25 years since the OG reality franchise took our screens by storm – which will be marked this autumn by an extended 25th anniversary series. So we are celebrating by fast-forwarding through a quarter-century of romances, rows and all-round ridiculousness to pick the greatest hits ofBig Brother– not the celebrity spin-off, otherwise George Galloway being a cat and “David’s dead!” would definitely feature. Instead we’re talking about the original and best civilian edition, whose pioneering 00s pomp came on Channel 4, before the less loved Channel 5 era – which was axed in 2018 until ITV rebooted it two years ago. These are the Endemol classic’s best bits. How many do you remember? Big Brother will get back to you.Welcome to the house of funBB1, July 2000View image in fullscreen‘Innocent times’ … Davina McCall with the first Big Brother winner, Craig Phillips.Photograph: Ken McKay/ShutterstockWe take it for granted now but when the Dutch format arrived on Channel 4, it felt genuinely groundbreaking. Ten punters entered a custom-built, camera-rigged house for the original “social experiment”, with nightly highlight shows and an online live feed (how modern). Davina McCall hosted and over her decade-long stint, became a national treasure. The first intake included lesbian ex-nun Anna Nolan and Darren Ramsay, who chatted to the chickens and named his favourite Marjorie. Innocent times. Well, until …Nasty Nick unmaskedBB1, August 2000The show’s breakout moment came when Liverpudlian builder Craig Phillips, the eventual winner, confronted housemate Nick Bateman about cheating. The City broker, who now lives under another name in Australia, had smuggled in pen and paper, then (gasp!) passed notes to manipulate nominations. The nation was outraged as Nasty Nick’s downfall unfolded in real-time. A panto villain was born and it turned reality TV evil for ever.Helen falls for PaulBB2, May 2001The original BB romance blossomed between Welsh hairdresser Helen Adams (who memorably declared “I like blinking, I do”) and car designer Paul Clarke (who boasted that he “lives like an international pop star”). A world away from today’s shameless Love Island showmances, the endearingly normal couple went on to have a five-year relationship.Brian Dowling’s demonsBB2, July 2001“Hold me, Bubble!” Irrepressible Ryanair flight attendant Brian Dowling was hilarious value and voted the all-time most popular winner. Glimpsing cameras behind the mirrors, he would declare them “Demons!”. He busted out a dance routine to Janet Jackson’s Nasty. Halfway through a buzzcut, he turned sideways and had a conversation with his own shaven-headed alter ego. Dowling would become the first out gay children’s TV presenter on SMTV and later hosted BB’s Channel 5 revival.Alison Hammond’s origin storyBB3, June 2002View image in fullscreenA star is born … Alison Hammond on Big Brother, 2002.Photograph: ITVA star was born when Brummie whirlwind Alison climbed on to a garden table to peek over the wall at the outside world. When the table broke, she headed straight to the Diary Room to confess, offering: “I could probably bend it back?” She finished 11th but won the hearts of viewers and is now a much-loved TV fixture.Tim sneakily shaves his chestBB3, July 2002Late arrival Tim “nice but dim” Culley won few friends by braying his catchphrase “Comprendez?”. He went down in BB lore by shaving off his ginger chest hair under the duvet, thinking nobody would notice – despite the presence of dozens of cameras.Jade’s verrucaBB3, July 2002The late Jade Goody became such a star that she returned for Celebrity Big Brother five years later. Cue a racism controversy which caused an international incident. First time around, though, the dental nurse was endearingly ditsy. Guileless utterances included “Sherlock Holmes invented toilets” and “East Angular – ain’t that abroad?” She didn’t cope well when it was pointed out that she had a verruca, wailing “Am I minging?”Alex works the cameraBB3, July 2002View image in fullscreen‘Stared into viewers’ souls’ … Alex Sibley’s lip-syncing in Big Brother 3.Photograph: ITVHousemates often forget the cameras are there, so it was a spine-tingling moment when finalist Alex Sibley stared straight down the lens and into viewers’ souls. Buttoning his shirt while disco hits played over the tannoy, he lip-synced to KC & the Sunshine Band’s That’s The Way (I Like It), seeming to flirt with the audience at home.Sub-table shenanigansBB5, July 2004It remains a mystery what went on under that tablecloth. BB5 lovebirds Michelle Bass and Stuart Wilson, AKA “Chicken Stu” hid under the kitchen table for some intimate action away from the cameras. When Davina asked for juicy details during her exit interview, Michelle coyly replied “No comment” to squeals from the crowd.Fight Night™BB5, July 2004“No naked jacuzzi-ness!” When Emma Greenwood and Michelle Bass were supposedly evicted, they actually moved to a secret bedsit to follow the house action on screens. This spark lit the fuse for the infamous Fight Night. When the pair made their shock return and booze was imbibed, a blazing row erupted between the resident rival cliques, Lip Gloss Bitches vs Jungle Cats. Food was thrown. Tables were flipped. Greenwood and Victor Ebuwa hit each other with trays. Security guards burst in, the live feed was cut and police were called in to investigate. Highlight or new low? You decide.Nádia takes the crownBB5, August 2004View image in fullscreenNádia Almada, winner of Big Brother series five, 2004.Photograph: Bruno Vincent/Getty ImagesShowering in high heels. Begging for cigarettes while dressed as a camo-clad soldier. Portugal-born Nádia Almada was the first transgender contestant, making it all the sweeter when she won. She feared a backlash from the public, so when she left the house to a rapturous reception, Nádia was poignantly overwhelmed.Kitten without a causeBB5, June 2004Rebellious Kitten Pinder’s stint was short but eventful. A Brighton anarchist who lived in a squat, Kitten Pinder was ejected after just eight days for breaking the rules an impressive 30 times. Only the second housemate after Nasty Nick to be booted out, she refused to nominate, tried to move the alcohol fridge into the bedroom and declined to go to the Diary Room when asked. Naturally, when she was thrown out, she refused to leave, resulting in the prize money being reduced. Days later, Kitten was up in court for non-payment of multiple parking fines. She blamed Tony Blair.Makosi’s phantom hot tub pregnancyBB6, June 2005View image in fullscreen‘I could be pregnant’ … Makosi Musambasi in Big Brother series six, 2005.Photograph: ShutterstockAfter Makosi Musambasi and eventual winner Anthony Hutton got steamy in the jacuzzi, Makosi stunned everyone by going to the Diary Room and whispering “I could be pregnant.” Within hours, she’d told two housemates that she was “90% sure”, vowing to keep the baby and asking Big Brother for a pregnancy test. Spoiler: she wasn’t pregnant. Anthony denied they’d even had sex.The Science bitBB6, July 2005Leeds musician Kieron “Science” Harvey became a cult figure for his argumentative nature and sardonic wit. He was forever baiting Conservative speechwriter Derek Laud, memorably during a cardboard box task. His highlight came when housemates Maxwell, Craig and Anthony sat in a row on the sofa. Self-styled “Citizen Science” pointed at his foes one-by-one and spat: “Tweedledum, Tweedledee and TweedleTWAT.”Wine o’clock for KingaBB6, July 2005View image in fullscreen‘The limits of acceptability’ … Kinga Karokzak’s wine bottle moment in Big Brother 6.Photograph: ShutterstockIt’s an image seared on viewers’ brains. Outrageous late arrival Kinga Karolczak swiftly made an impression by stripping off for hot tub sessions. One tipsy evening took a surprise turn when she tottered into the garden to become, ahem, better acquainted with a wine bottle. Ofcom later said it “operated at the limits of acceptability”.Nikki’s Diary Room rantsBB7, June 2006The late, great Nikki Grahame was the undisputed queen of tantrums and tirades. She complained about the air con (“I’m so cooooold!”) and housemate Richard Newman finishing the cornflakes (“the fat ox!”). Most memorably, she was apoplectic with rage when newcomer Susie Verrico nominated her, despite “not even knowing me”. “Who is she?” shrieked Grahame. “Where did you find her?”Aisleyne says it straightBB7, June 2006Self-confessed “ghetto princess” Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace had a winning way with a put-down. As a late arrival, she soon got the measure of Nikki, telling her: “You better know yourself, little girl.” When she returned in 2015 as a “Time Warp houseguest”, Aisleyne hadn’t lost it. Putting former escort Helen Wood on a bargain budget, she reasoned: “Basic rations for a basic bitch.”Glyn’s got the eggs factorBB7, July 2006If you know, you know. As gawky Welsh teenager Glynn Wise boiled himself some breakfast, he improvised a catchy little song to celebrate: “I’m cooking an egg for the very first time, ah-mmm.” To this day, BB fans of a certain vintage find themselves humming it when cooking eggs. Fun fact: Glyn is now a priest.Pete takes a dipBB7, August 2006View image in fullscreenPete Bennett in Big Brother series seven, 2006.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockWinner Pete Bennett, a Brighton musician with Tourette syndrome, had an unlikely romance with housemate Nikki Grahame and said in his exit interview that Big Brother had saved his life. All very touching but not as funny as when he lost his balance while chatting in the garden and toppled backwards into the pool.Brian Belo wets the bedBB8, July 2007The second Brian to win the show, Essex boy Belo provided all manner of inadvertent lolz. He’d never heard of Shakespeare and insisted “the moon is bigger than the universe”. The morning after one of his “cider binges” – this was before duty-of-care protocols were tightened – Brian admitted having “an accident” during the night. Housemates promised they wouldn’t tell anyone, despite it airing on primetime TV.Mario proposes to LisaBB9, August 2008Warrington fortysomethings Mario Marconi and Lisa Appleton were the first contestants to enter the house as a couple – and super Mario had a surprise in store. He donned black tie, stood on a heart-shaped plinth and popped the question via Love Actually-style placards. Loved-up Lisa said yes and they tied the knot two years later. Aww. Except they’ve since split and Lisa has done tell-all interviews admitting that she has struggled with addiction … to sausages. No, really.Josie Gibbon, more likeBB11, August 2010Like La Hammond, Josie Gibson is another daytime TV favourite who first found fame on BB. The self-confessed “daft Bristolian bird” won the last edition to be shown on Channel 4 with a record 77.5% of the public vote. However, Gibson’s highlight came when she shared her failsafe mood-lifter: “Whenever I’m feeling a bit low, I think: ‘At least I’m not that woman who had her face ripped off by a chimpanzee’.” Relatable.Andrew Tate’s early exitBB17, June 2016This lukewarm later series was mainly notable for a certain Andrew Tate being among the housemates. He was ejected on Day Six after a video emerged which apparently showed him hitting a woman with a belt. Tate claimed it was a prank and he’d been misrepresented. In happier news, this run also saw a Diary Room meltdown from ex-model Jayne Connery, who was “bored shitless by conversations about hair tongs” and asked Big Brother: “Are you fucking on drugs?”Cameron comes outBB19, October 2018A reminder of reality TV as a force for good. The last series of the Channel 5 era saw 18-year-old Cameron Cole come out as gay during a conversation with housemate Lewis. He eventually plucked up the courage to tell the whole house, prompting fellow contestants to cry, clap and congratulate him. The tender moment led to an outpouring of support on social media. Cameron went on to become BB’s youngest ever winner.Three’s a crowdBB20, October 2023The defining storyline of ITV’s reboot was a gay love triangle. Lawyer Jordan and food critic Henry quickly clicked – but two weeks later, Jordan began flirting with doctor Matty, despite him having a boyfriend on the outside. Heartbreakingly, Henry broke down in tears because he’d “lost his best friend” in the house. They sweetly patched things up and Jordan went on to win. After dating for 18 months, the pair amicably split.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBig BrotherReality TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It came as a response to what Pret said was a “shift in what customers want from lunch”, though possibly not from their wallet, with the premium salads priced £10-£13.But how good are they? And is it right that they cost that much? I set off to recreate the miso salmon super plate at home. It’s fun copying the ingredients off the back of a packet to come up with a recipe. With the miso salmon plate, I’m impressed by the original: the plate looks very pretty, and the lightly smoked salmon fillet has an excellent texture. The tenderstem broccoli is just-blanched, and pleasingly crunchy.It’s only when I compare the miso-orange dressing with my own version that I realise quite how much sugar must have gone in – ditto the chilli aubergine, which is a bit gloopy (thanks, cornflour). But it’s a generous dish, and with a triple hit of protein from the salmon, soya beans and quinoa, I have none of my usual sugar/chocolate cravings in the afternoon.Pret a Manger launches salad revamp – and one starts at £12.95Read moreBased on the texture of the Pret aubergine, I treated it like the Korean side-dish gaji-namul – steaming the aubergine before stirring through the dressing (minus the cornflour). The homemade dish is very close in taste, but overall my dish tastes punchier, because I used freshly grated ginger and garlic throughout, rather than pastes.The significant difference is the cost: Pret’s salad comes in at £12.95, while my homemade one comes in at about £8.14 a person, after factoring in the proportion of each packet or jar used (I got most of it from Sainsbury’s and the more unusual or less widely available ingredients from Sous Chef). But if you haven’t already got shichimi togarashi, gochugaru (red pepper flakes) or aonori seaweed in your cupboard, then you’re setting yourself back £11.65 just on “store-cupboard ingredients” you might never use again. So £8-ish, plus an initial outlay of £12 to recreate this at home, which is more than a bit steep.The clincher? I’m not the kind of home cook or food writer who ever, ever wants you to have to use two pans, a steamer, two sieves, three bowls and a baking tray to make a single dish. You might not mind several processes and more than an hour hands-on time for a recipe, butIreallydo.Ultimately, I’d say the Pret salad is worth £12.95, because there’s no outlay on expensive store-cupboard ingredients and, given its quality (it’s fresher than comparable on the go post-workout meals). And it’d certainly save me £3-£4 on cake/cookies/ice-cream in the afternoon.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Publicity imageHow to make amisosalmonsuper plate at homePrepInterminableCook20 minCost£8.14a portionServes22 lightly smoked salmon fillets2 teaspoons mixed seeds2 teaspoons shichimi togarashi½ teaspoon aonori seaweed½ teaspoon sea salt flakes½ tablespoon rapeseed oil50g mixed black & white quinoa½ aubergine, sliced lengthways and cut into 1cm quarter moons1 clove garlic, peeled and grated2 tsp gochugaru (red pepper powder)¼ tsp chilli powder20ml rapeseed oil5ml brown rice vinegar½ tsp sugar½ tsp sea salt flakes6 stemstenderstem broccoli4 heaped tbsp edamame beans2 handfuls mixed salad leaves1 ripe avocado, finely sliced and dressed with a little lemon juice15ml rapeseed oil15g miso paste (I used red)10ml brown rice vinegar½ tsp finely grated ginger½ tsp finely grated garlic½ tsp sugarPinch chilli powderPinch sea salt flakes½ lime, cut into quarters to serveskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

Although the duel offered glimpses into the potential from both sides of the net,Iga Swiatekdefeated Amanda Anisimova 6-4, 6-2 en route to Poland’s triumph over the US in the Junior Fed Cup. Even though Anisimova endured a difficult afternoon, memories of those days immediately drew a smile to her face. “I used to enjoy those Fed Cup trips a lot,” she says. “We had a lot of fun.“She was playing very well. She was a great junior – I remember a lot of coaches were saying that she’s going to be a big deal one day. They were right.”Aryna Sabalenka admits to ‘hate relationship’ with Wimbledon after semi-final lossRead moreMany coaches said similar things about Anisimova in those days and their instincts were also correct. On Saturday Swiatek and Anisimova, now 24 and 23, will meet in theWimbledonsingles final. Despite being born three months apart, this will be their first professional meeting.For both of them this has been a long time coming. During their time as juniors, Anisimova immediately flitted ahead of her contemporaries. She was a junior US Open champion in 2017, at the age of 16, and by the time Swiatek won her junior grand slam title at Wimbledon a year later, Anisimova had graduated to the professional tours.Her first peak was marked by an unforgettablesemi-final run at the 2019 French Openand it seemed inevitable that her success would continue. At the same tournament, Swiatek had her own modest breakthrough as she reached the fourth round of a grand slam for the first time. Although she was the first from their age group to make it to the highest levels of the sport, Anisimova’s rapid rise soon halted. She struggled with the gruelling nature of being a professional and with grief after her father’s death,taking an eight-month mental health breakbefore returning at the beginning of last year.Her performances this year have shown the importance of taking a step back and moving at your own pace instead of constantly looking to push through difficulties and pain. With her run this week, she will break into the top 10 from her ranking of 12, rising at least to No 7.View image in fullscreenAmanda Anisimova is through to her first grand slam final.Photograph: James Marsh/ShutterstockAnisimova has peerless shot-making abilities – almost nobody on the tour is blessed with her timing, clean technique and hand-eye coordination, which allow her to generate such destructive power from all parts of the court with ease. Yet the biggest revelation on the way to a maiden grand slam final has been the American’s competitive abilities and toughness.For much of her career, her talent has been in dialogue with her mental and physical vulnerabilities. After managing the pressure of being the heavy favourite in every match en route to the semi-finals, she was tough in the many momentsSabalenka could have turned the matchagain.While Anisimova’s path became difficult, Swiatek kept on rising. She is the greatest player of her generation, a five-time grand slam champion. Despite the past 12 months marking one of the most challenging periods she arrived here ranked No 3 in the world.View image in fullscreenIga Swiatek won the girls’ title at Wimbledon in 2018.Photograph: Matthew Stockman/Getty ImagesSwiatek’s inability to win a fourth consecutive French Open title, it turns out, has been a blessing in disguise. Instead of catching her breath after yet another French Open title, her relative underperformance on clay allowed her to immediately prepare for the grass-court season. The additional time on the surface has allowed her to gain more comfort than ever before.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In many ways, Anisimova fits the profile of the type of opponent Swiatek can sometimes be vulnerable to on faster surfaces. She is a devastating shotmaker who can take returns early, rob Swiatek of time with her early, flat ball-striking and flatten the Pole’s second serve.However, Swiatek’s tendency to rise up and produce her best on the biggest occasions speaks for itself. She is 5-0 in grand slam finals and 16-2 in big finals, matches that often have not been close.Although Swiatek and Anisimova have taken different paths since those days in Budapest, they have backed up their early promise and established themselves on the biggest stages.Now they will renew their nine-year rivalry with everything on the line.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Iga SwiatekWimbledonTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There were no drugs onboard this time, but most notably, there were no traffickers.Last week, the Colombian navy announced that it had seized an “autonomous semisubmersible”, the first seizure of such a vessel in the country’s waters.Detected near Santa Marta, off Colombia’s Caribbean coast, the small grey vessel was equipped with antennas and a Starlink modem. Two surveillance cameras were also installed: one on the bow, providing a real-time view of the craft’s trajectory and obstacles, and another inside to monitor the engine and transmission. Officials believe the uncrewed sub was on a trial run to transport cocaine to the United States or Europe.“The discovery reflects a migration toward more sophisticated unmanned systems that increase evasion capabilities, and which pose a growing challenge to international maritime security,” said Adm Juan Ricardo Rozo Obregón, commander of the Colombian navy.‘I had 30 Lamborghinis’: Pablo Escobar’s top cocaine pilot gives first interviewRead moreThe navy has warned that autonomous technologies are “an emerging threat that is transforming the transnational criminal landscape”, and said that it believed the vessel was operated by the Gulf Clan, Colombia’s largest drug-trafficking group.The discovery comes as Colombia – the world’s leading cocaine producer – faces record-high production of the drug, fuelled by surging global demand. The country’s estimated coca leaf cultivation increased from 204,000 to 253,000 hectares (504,000 to 625,000 acres) in 2023, according to theUnited Nations.While traffickers have used crewed semisubmersibles for decades, the recent advent of the uncrewed vessels shows that gangs are making significant technological advances. They are also seeking new ways to eliminate the risk of captured operators cooperating with authorities.“It’s definitely a sign of how creative traffickers are becoming, and how ‘narco subs’ have evolved significantly in both design and technology,” said Henry Shuldiner, an investigator at the InSight Crime thinktank, who co-authored a report on the rise of narco subs. “This unmanned model seems like the next step in that evolution.”Shuldiner said that traffickers were testing whether removing crews – which typically involve at least four people, particularly for long transatlantic journeys – could make the lucrative trade more efficient.“The fact that this appeared to be a test run shows traffickers are willing to invest in research and development, even if that means losing a vessel to authorities,” he said. Building a semisubmersible can cost as little as $150,000, thoughmost estimatesplace the cost between $1m and $2m.Juana Cabezas, a researcher at Colombia’s Institute for Development and Peace Studies,toldAFP that Mexican drug cartels, which operate in Colombia, began “hiring technology experts and engineers to develop an unmanned submarine” as far back as 2017, adding that drone vessels made it harder for the authorities to identify those behind the shipments.Colombian law punishes the use, construction, possession and transportation of semisubmersibles with penalties of up to 14 years in prison.Nonetheless, a near-record number of the low-profile vessels were intercepted crossing the Atlantic and Pacific in 2024,according to InSight Crime.“In some years, we’ve seen 30 or more interdictions globally. And that’s just the ones we know about,” said Shuldiner. “Some US officials estimate that only around 5% of these vessels actually get caught. So even with near-record seizures in 2024, most are still slipping through.”While most cocaine is still smuggled on container ships, narco subs are playing a growing role, especially for long-haul, transoceanic routes, he added.The Colombian navy said that in the first half of 2025, 10 semisubmersibles were detected in different regions of the continent, all adapted to make them difficult to track by radar, and even mobilise with partial autonomy.Sergio Guzmán, the director of Colombia Risk Analysis, said that while this marks the first capture in Colombian waters, it is most likely not the first deployment. “The authorities are one step behind the criminals when it comes to these things,” he said.He warned it would be “very difficult” for Colombia and other governments to “keep up” unless countries improve information sharing and cooperation.Globally,cocaine productionsoared by nearly 34% in 2023 compared with the previous year, while an estimated 25 million people used the drug, up from 17 million a decade earlier.Explore more on these topicsColombiaDrugs tradeAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Unite rejected a deal in Birmingham and their demands would have undermined equal pay, discriminating against female workers. Angela won’t be pushed around, and she quit Unite some months ago.“Angela’s been fighting for equal pay for decades as a trade unionist, and as a home-care worker has experienced what it was like to be paid less as a working-class woman for the same work.”View image in fullscreenStriking bin workers stand in front of billboards commissioned by Unite this week in Birmingham.Photograph: Guy Smallman/Getty ImagesThe Unite motion said Rayner and several Labour councillors had been suspended for “bringing the union into disrepute” and there would be an investigation into their behaviour with a “view to expelling them from the union”, although this would appear not to be possible in Rayner’s case.She is understood to have made her last membership payment in April, although she was still recorded as being a member of Unite on the last list of ministerial interests published on 29 May.The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, accused the Labour-led Birmingham council of carrying out action similar to fire-and-rehire as striking workers were being replaced by agency workers and faced the possibility of redundancy.“Unite is crystal clear it will call out bad employers regardless of the colour of their rosette,” she said. “Angela Rayner has had every opportunity to intervene and resolve this dispute but has instead backed a rogue council that has peddled lies and smeared its workers fighting huge pay cuts.“The disgraceful actions of the government and a so-called Labour council is essentially fire and rehire and makes a joke of the Employment Relations Act promises. People up and down the country are asking whose side is the Labour government on and coming up with the answer: not workers.”The Unite motion, which was passed overwhelmingly, said the union was prepared to discuss its relationship with Labour if Birmingham council forced through the redundancies of striking workers.It suggests Unite could be ready to end hundreds of thousands of pounds in funding for the party. Unite gave about £2m to Labour in the year before the election. It has scaled back its financial support in recent years, with Unison now contributing more, but it is historically the party’s biggest union backer, having given more than £70m raised from its members since the Electoral Commission’s records began in 2007.Friends of Rayner in the union movement rallied round her following the spat, with many dismissing it as a performance to underline Unite’s hardline position in the bin workers’ strike.One MP close to the unions said: “Colleagues across the movement are saying Unite have completely lost the plot. Angela has done more for workers than any politician in decades and picking a fight with her shows they’re not serious.“Frankly, this behaviour won’t deliver for Unite members. It’s seems about [Graham] trying to take the limelight, posturing and her looking to next year’s general secretary election.”However, a senior Unite source said the motion was not a stunt and represented real anger at the conference among delegates about Labour’s position on the bin strike. They said Graham was representing her members and suggested a falling-out with Labour was a growing prospect.The union also voted to suspend the membership of John Cotton, the Labour leader of Birmingham council, who on Wednesday said the local authority was at the “absolute limit of what we can offer”. The council has not said what its next steps would be but it said this week that it needed to proceed with changes to its services without delay, as the latest round of talks ended without resolution.Unite’s dispute is with Birmingham city council, but since 2023 the local authority’s finances and governance have been overseen by government-appointed commissioners who are answerable to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Only Labour is delivering the change working people voted for and so deserve.”A No 10 spokesperson said of the strike that the government’s priority had always been Birmingham residents.View image in fullscreenUncollected refuse bags in the Aston area of Birmingham in June. There are still issues with uncollected rubbish in the city.Photograph: Jacob King/PAThere is still uncollected rubbish in Birmingham, although the situation has improved since late March when the councildeclared a major incidentover the mountains of bin bags on the streets.In May, the council secured a court order preventing striking bin workers on the picket line from delaying bin lorries leaving depots, which was one of their tactics to ensure the strike had the most impact.Many regular bin collections have since resumed, with the lorries being staffed by agency workers. But parts of the city, particularly more deprived areas, still have piles of waste in the street, with the smell exacerbated by the hot weather.Recycling bin collections in the city of more than 1 million people have been suspended since early February and residents have been told to take their recycling waste to the tip or store it at home. In reality, many people have put it in their general waste bin, with growing concern about the environmental impact as the strike drags on.Explore more on these topicsLabourAngela RaynerUniteBirminghamIndustrial actionEnglandTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump has not previously approved packages of military aid to Ukraine.“So what we’re doing is the weapons that are going out are going to Nato, and then Nato is going to be giving those weapons [to Ukraine], and Nato is paying for those weapons,” Trump said, probably indicating that they would be purchased by countries that are members of the Nato security bloc. Administration officials have said this would be different from the US supplying Ukraine directly, as Nato and not Washington would be making the decision to arm Kyiv.Germany and other member states of the security bloc had spoken publicly about ongoing negotiations to purchase weapons from the United States to transfer to Ukraine.Ukraine is producing more modern weaponry including drones, but still relies on the US to supply everything from Patriot missiles to defend from nightly Russian missile and drone attacks, Himars long-range missiles to strike behind Russian lines, 155mm artillery shells and other munitions.The Axios news website said that some officials had said the US would only sell Ukraine “defensive” weapons, while others said the package could also include “offensive” weapons such as the Himars missiles.Yet a key stumbling block remains US military production. The US only has about 25% of the Patriot missile interceptors it needs for all of the Pentagon’s military plans, the Guardian revealed this month, and fulfilling new orders can take years depending on the priority level given to the contract.Kellogg is expected to address the US weapons shipments during his visit to Kyiv, the first since shortly after Trump’s inauguration.During the interview, Trump also endorsed the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, a bill introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally seen as a leader of Russia hawks in the legislature.

The private company employs American mercenaries to oversee four food distribution zones, as opposed to the previous 400 non-militarised zones run under the UN system.The GHF said the UN figures were “false and misleading” and denied that deadly incidents occurred at its sites. “The fact is the most deadly attacks on aid sites have been linked to UN convoys,” a GHF spokesperson said.GHF also denied that any injuries were inflicted at any of its sites, blaming Israeli troops firing on Palestinians trying to reach the four hubs it has established in southern and central Gaza.In Gaza, the GHF has become infamous for the near-daily shootings of people seeking food who have queued to receive meals since the group started operating in early May. Palestinians seeking food have to navigate a complicated set of instructions and stick to specific routes, as well as walk long distances to access the food sites. Even then there is no guarantee they will be safe.On Friday the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières said its teams in Gaza were witnessing “a sharp and unprecedented rise in acute malnutrition”. The number of cases at its Gaza City clinic has nearly quadrupled over the past two months.At least 10 people were killed and more than 60 injured on Friday when Israeli forces opened fire on a crowd in Rafah, southern Gaza, according to Ahmad al-Farra, the head of paediatrics at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, which received the dead and wounded.At least 15 Palestinians were killed overnight and on Friday by Israeli airstrikes in northern Gaza, including a strike on a school serving as a refugee shelter.“The situation in the hospital was like it always is during massacres: extreme overcrowding, shortage of medical supplies and medicines, and a very high number of injured compared with the number of doctors,” said Farra.Treatment units were set up outside the hospital to cope with the influx of patients as hallways inside filled with the wounded.The situation in the hospital, one of the few medical facilities still operating in southern Gaza, was made more difficult after the Israeli military operated in the surrounding areas overnight.Doctors reported shells landing nearby and heavy gunfire on the outskirts of the hospital, with a number of patients arriving with gunshot wounds.The areas around the hospital were filled with encampments for displaced people and witnesses said Israeli forces had stationed tanks and fired teargas at tents. Two local people reported Israeli soldiers in a nearby cemetery, while one said they saw the soldiers exhuming bodies there.View image in fullscreenPalestinians inspect the destruction at a makeshift displacement camp and adjacent cemetery after a reported incursion by the Israeli military in Khan Younis.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesIsraeli forces withdrew from the surrounding areas in the morning, but Farra warned the hospital only had enough fuel for the next 48 hours unless new supplies arrived. Air conditioning had to be shut off in the hospital to preserve power amid the sweltering summer heat.Nahla abu Qursheen, a 35-year-old mother of four who fled the tanks on Thursday, said those who did return to the encampment found their tents destroyed. Pictures showed ruined tents amid deep furrows in the ground on Friday.“I still don’t know what happened to our tent. We are still here on the street. Last night was very difficult – missiles and shelling. My children slept on top of each other, just to fit under a single piece of cloth,” Abu Qursheen said, exhausted from sleeping in the street.Israel has intensified its airstrikes on Gaza over the last week, as negotiators report a ceasefire deal is in sight, but not yet achieved.The US president, Donald Trump, said on Wednesday he was optimistic a deal was possible this week or next, during the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington. Hamas reportedly agreed to release 10 hostages of the 50 that remain, during the two-month ceasefire period.Qatari mediators have warned a ceasefire will take time, as key stumbling blocks remain. Hamas wants assurances that Israel will not restart fighting as it did in mid-March after the first Gaza ceasefire, while Israel is seeking the complete expulsion of Hamas from the Gaza Strip.Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, has floated the proposal of relocating the population to a “humanitarian city” in southern Gaza, which legal experts have described asa blueprint for crimes against humanity.Juliette Touma, the communications director for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said such a plan would worsen the humanitarian crisis and forcibly displace people in Gaza.The war in Gaza started after Hamas-led militants killed more than 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 hostages on 7 October 2023. More than 57,000 people have been killed during Israel’s 21 months of military operations there.As negotiations drag on, people in Gaza say they are losing hope.“They say there is a truce, they say! Every day they say it will end today or tomorrow, but it’s all lies. Wake up and stop this war. Enough of the death, the hunger and the constant displacement,” Abu Qursheen said.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelUnited NationsHuman rightsAidnewsShareReuse this content"

The club have announced that the No 20 will no longer be used across all levels of the club, including the men’s team, the women’s team and through academy levels.The tribute, the first in Liverpool’s history, is a reflection of how valued the Portugal international was as a player and a person at the club.Liverpoolfans have called for the retirement of the No 20 shirt since the 28-year-old and his brother died in north-western Spain. Liverpool deliberately timed the announcement at 20:20 BST on Friday.The decision to retire the shirt was made after consultation with Jota’s wife, Rute Cardoso, and parents, Isabel and Joaquim, who travelled to Merseyside on Friday to witness the outpouring of affection for the striker and the tributes left outside Anfield. Jota’s family were accompanied to the stadium by the entire Liverpool squad as they made their first public appearance since the tragic accident.Jota died just 11 days after his marriage to his long-term partner and left behind three young children. He and his brother were understood to be driving to Santander to take a ferry back to England before pre-season training, having been advised not to fly following a recent lung procedure.Liverpool will play their first game since the accident at Preston on Sunday, when both clubs will pay a number of tributes to Jota and his brother. Liverpool’s anthem, You’ll Never Walk Alone, will be played before kick-off and there will be a minute’s silence at Deepdale, where both sets of players will wear black armbands.Explore more on these topicsDiogo JotaLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

His return to the White House has spurred a climate backlash as hepushes for higher production of oil and gas.HSBC net zero goal delayed 20 years, as CEO offered 600% bonusRead moreHSBC was a founding member of the NZBA at its launch in 2021, with the bank’s then chief executive, Noel Quinn, saying it was vital to “establish a robust and transparent framework for monitoring progress” towards net zero carbon-emission targets.“We want to set that standard for the banking industry. Industry-wide collaboration is essential in achieving that goal,”Quinn said.Convened by the UN environment programme’s finance initiative but led by banks, the NZBA commits members to aligning their lending, investment and capital markets activities with net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 or earlier.Six of the largest banks in the US – JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs – left the NZBA after Trump was elected.UK lenders including Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest, Standard Chartered and Nationwidewere still listed as members as of Friday afternoon.In February HSBC announced it wasdelaying key parts of its climate goals by 20 yearsand watering down environmental targets in a new long-term bonus plan for its chief executive, Georges Elhedery, who took over last year.The climate campaign group ShareAction condemned the move, saying it was “yet another troubling signal around the bank’s commitment to addressing the climate crisis”.Jeanne Martin, ShareAction’s co-director of corporate engagement, said: “It sends a counterproductive message to governments and companies, despite the multiplying financial risks of global heating and the heatwaves, floods and extreme weather it will bring.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He dedicated his life to policing and will be remembered as one of the most influential police leaders of recent decades.“Lord Ian will also be remembered for the vast contribution he made to improving our overall approach to policing and the service we provide to victims.”Born in Chester in 1953, Blair joined the Met in 1974. He was an Oxford graduate, then rare in policing. He eventually moved to Thames Valley police as assistant chief constable before becoming chief constable of Surrey police and returning to the Met in 2000 to take up the position of deputy commissioner.Blair’s death came 20 years after the month of the two biggest events of his career.He faced strong calls for his resignation over the shooting of the innocent Brazilian electrician De Menezes on 22 July 2005, the day after terrorists had attempted a repeat attack on London’s transport system.Coming two weeks after the 7 July London bombings, officers mistook De Menezes for a suicide bomber.He was held down and shot repeatedly in the head by an armed officer at Stockwell tube station in south London.Blair insisted on fighting a health and safety prosecution over the disaster and the force was found guilty by a jury of “catastrophic” failings.His labelling as a liberal police officer led to rightwing papers and internal critics damning him as obsessed with political correctness. He stressed the need for neighbourhood policing, but his ideas were being undermined by a force imploding.Some who were publicly loyal to him were privately aghast at his decisions, his behaviour and his inability to listen.The end of his commissionership saw top officers falling out with each other and a senior Asian officer suing for racial discrimination, as the top of the force threatened to collapse into chaos.He resigned in 2008. In his resignation letter, Blair said: “It is the duty of the commissioner to lead the Met through good times and bad: to accept the burdens and pressures of office and, above all, to be a steward of the service he commands.”In his 2009 memoir, Policing Controversy, Blair warned of the dangers of political meddling in policing: “A police service that serves one political party or individual is an emblem of dictatorship.”Explore more on these topicsIan BlairMetropolitan policeLondonHouse of LordsPoliceEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This was surely one of the 24-time grand slam champion’s last chances for a major victory, a challenge that only continues to grow as age takes him further from his physical peak while Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz move closer to their own.Two hours later, by the time Sinner was finished with him, Djokovic’s hopes of winning a 25th grand slam title seemed painfully remote. Sinner completely dismantled an ailing Djokovic, exposing the Serb’s sluggish movement with his weight of shot and unimpeachable defence to reach theWimbledonfinal for the first time with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win.Carlos Alcaraz channels Sampras to see off Fritz and close on Wimbledon trebleRead moreA month after suffering the most devastating loss of his career, holding triple championship point against Alcaraz in the French Open final before losing in five sets, Sinner has offered an admirable presentation of his mental fortitude and resilience by immediately making his way through to another final. Sinner, the world No 1, will have a chance to avenge that defeat at the earliest possible moment as he faces Alcaraz once again after the Spaniard defeated Taylor Fritz in four sets in the other semi-final.As their combined grip on men’s tennis continues to strengthen, Alcaraz and Sinner will be the second pair of players in the open era to contest the men’s finals at the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year, which Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer achieved for three consecutive years between 2006 and 2008.“We saw the last final – you never know [what will happen],” Sinner said. “It’s an honour to share the court with Carlos again. We try to push ourselves to the limit. Hopefully it’s going to be a good match like the last one, but I don’t know if it can be better because I don’t think it’s possible.”View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic was unable to cope with the class of the world No 1, Jannik Sinner.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe Italian extends his run of dominance against Djokovic to five wins in a row and he has not lost to him since 2023. He is also the sixth player in the open era to reach four consecutive men’s singles grand slam finals, joining a distinguished list: Federer, Djokovic, Nadal, Andre Agassi and Rod Laver.Before the match, Djokovic expressed confidence about his level after their tight three-set match in the French Open semi-finals. At 38 years old, his physical preparedness for a best of five sets battle with Sinner was less certain: Djokovic skipped practice on Thursday after suffering a heavy fall two points before winning his quarter-final against Flavio Cobolli.Sinner immediately made it clear that a long, arduous day awaited Djokovic by performing at a supreme level from the off and at 1-1 he put together a superb return game to break Djokovic’s serve. The 23-year-old looked impenetrable throughout the first hour, covering every blade of grass with his perfectly timed and balanced open stance, sliding to both sides, which permits him to attack on either ground stroke from any part of the court. He served spectacularly, too, completely shutting Djokovic out of his service games.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner brought his service A-game to Centre Court.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBetween his punishing weight of shot off both wings, which constantly stole time from Djokovic, and the difficulty of consistently putting the ball past him, the effect of Sinner’s game on his opponents is total suffocation. Djokovic’s movement was laboured, particularly when forced to change directions in the corners. Midway through set two, Djokovic began to serve and volley practically every other point. But completely ceding the baseline only served to further illustrate his woes.Down two sets in barely over an hour, Djokovic received a medical timeout for his left leg and inner thigh. Although a brief loss of concentration from Sinner allowed Djokovic to build up a 3-0 lead in set three, with the Serb’s legs increasingly heavy it was only a matter of time before Sinner pulled him back in.As Djokovic slowly departed Centre Court, he took his time as he saluted all corners of a stadium that, after witnessing so many of his greatest moments, now sees him in his final stretch. “I just got off the court so, of course, I’m upset and disappointed. Mostly not for the loss, because obviously even if I was fit, I wasn’t a favourite to win against Sinner, I know that, but I think I had good chances if I was fit,” said Djokovic. “But it’s just that physical aspect that is bothering me. You’re there. You want to play. You’re determined. But then the body doesn’t want to listen. That’s it. That’s what you can say about it.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Jannik SinnerNovak DjokovicTennisWimbledonnewsShareReuse this content"

But in addition it served as a reminder that diplomacy is not only an art, but art itself has always been an essential tool of diplomacy. So theextended loan of the Bayeux tapestry, exchanged with treasures from Sutton Hoo, is not just a gesture of trust but marks a return to the roots of diplomacy, and its cultural lure.Doubtless security experts will remember the summit’s declarations of new nuclear co-operation while pollsters will eye“the one in, one out” migrant dealto see if it actually turns the political tide in the Channel. But the popular legacy will be the queues forming at the British Museum from September 2026 when the tapestry goes on display, and in Rouen and Caen when the treasures from Sutton Hoo are viewed by the French in what is already being billed as the “Year of the Normans”. True, some Telegraph readers are already spluttering about the French sending a reminder of their conquest of the Anglo-Saxons, or that Britain is just a convenient place to dump the cloth during the two-year closure of the Bayeux Museum, but the British Museum has the prospect of huge crowds to enjoy.Art and antiques, alongside silk fabrics, animals and inventions, have always been the mainstay of the diplomatic gift, the entry point and sometimes the centre point for any communication. Indeed in academic literature, art has been described as the mute diplomat. The historian of early modern diplomacy Anthony Colantuono argues that artworks, both as gifts and on display, are not peripheral accessories to political action but are in themselves instruments of diplomatic persuasion or seduction. They function as rhetorical devices, which have the potential to “say that which the [diplomat] is not permitted to say, without uttering a single word”.‘Momentous occasion’: how Bayeux Museum finally said yes to tapestry loanRead moreSo established had the diplomatic gift become that by 1071 – a little after William I sent his small boats across the Channel – “the Book of Gifts and Rarities” was compiled by an official in the Fatimid caliphate detailing five centuries of lavish presents at Islamic diplomatic meetings, weddings and a circumcision feast. It is a catalogue of artistry capable of filling any national museum. The Doge’s Palace in Venice is in part a monument to the trade in often spiritual gifts designed to bridge cultures between Safavid Persia and Venetian diplomats.View image in fullscreenA monument to diplomatic trade? The interior of the Doge’s Palace in Venice.Photograph: Stefano Mazzola/Awakening/Getty ImagesGifts are not just tokens of esteem, but can have more cynical motives such as acting as permits for slavers and missionaries. The first known mechanical clock to reach Japan was presented by the Jesuit Francis Xavier in the 1550s to Ōuchi Yoshitaka, the daimyō of Yamaguchi in western Japan. In return for being able to practise religion, the Jesuits offered “a mirror that could make old eyes see afresh” [ie spectacles], an instrument that “could play all the sounds of the thirteen-stringed koto without plucking any strings” (a harpsichord), “two mirrors that made one see far-away things very clearly” (possibly a telescope) and “a sounding bell that did not distinguish between the length of night and day in regulating the hours” (a mechanical clock).Ekaterina Heath, a historian of 19th-century Russia, also points to gifts sometimes not merely being acts of goodwill, but rather a form of “symbolic violence” intended to influence decision-making. The British envoys, she argues, used these gifts to gain leverage and ensure favourable negotiations on issues such as trade and military alliances. The timing of the gifts coincided with efforts to pressure Russia in matters of trade and war, highlighting the strategic nature of these diplomatic gestures. Consequently, during the period 1795–97, the British government sent a range of gifts to Russia: a Herschel telescope for Empress Catherine II, hundreds of exotic plants from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew for Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna, and six horses for Emperor Paul I.The most generous ruler would not just send a work of art, but a celebrated artist, as did Philip IV of Spain when he sent Peter Paul Rubens on a diplomatic mission in 1629 to the court of Charles I of England. Rubens completed the preliminary negotiations for a treaty of peace and friendship between the two countries, and painted three works for the king.View image in fullscreenTreasures from the Sutton Hoo burial site will be loaned to France to be exhibited in Normandy.Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty ImagesBut it is the French rather than the Spanish who became the masters of the diplomatic gift when French citizens in 1885 sent the Statue of Liberty, a commemoration of America’s independence from England and the abolition of slavery, to New York. It arrived reduced to 350 individual pieces and packed in 214 crates, and became a symbol of safe harbour for millions of migrants. Nearly a century later in 1963, the French pulled off a coup after a long debate about loaning national treasures abroad and sent the Mona Lisa overseas for the first time. Her smile, unflustered by the crowds, came to be seen by 1 million Americans at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.ButFrancehas also been the victim of the most infamous disaster in diplomatic gifting of modern times.In 2013, a grateful Malian government gave a baby camel to the then French president, François Hollande, during a triumphant visit to Timbuktu after French troops had intervened to weaken Islamist rebels who had seized the north of the country. Hollande left the camel with a local family prior to arranging its transport to Paris, but owing to a miscommunication the familyslaughtered the animaland gobbled it up it in a tagine sauce.Explore more on these topicsBayeux tapestryForeign policyBritish MuseumArtFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But this one offers a solution to England’s crisis in special needs education.On one recent summer day the class was doing creative writing. Yet with every pupil having special needs in speech and communication, writing is just one part of the lesson. “Remember to reply to me,” the teacher gently reminds one pupil after discussing their work. “When I say something, you need to reply.”Later a pupil starts “stimming” – self-stimulating by repetitive movements, often seen among children with autism – but is quickly interrupted by the teacher. “Do you need time out?” she asks quietly.The classroom, known as the Bethlehem unit, has the rows of desks and whiteboard of a typical school but only eight pupils, who all have education, health and care plans (EHCPs), formal agreements between families and local authorities that detail each child’s needs.Schools in England ‘need complex changes’ to take more pupils with special needsRead moreThe fate of EHCPs has been thrust into the political spotlight, after ministers refused to confirm reports that they will be curtailed or abolished. Although its official title is a “specialist resource provision”, the Bethlehem unit is, in effect, a mini special school inside a mainstream secondary – a model that ministers are pinning their hopes on as they prepare a new schools white paper for October.Ria Dhillon, whose son Kai has attended the unit, said the school had been “wonderful”, nudging him to reach his potential in subjects such as maths in which he had previously lacked confidence.“What we’ve got here, in the Bethleham unit, finds out what they are good at and pushes them. Whereas in a lot of other schools that don’t have these facilities for kids with EHCPs, they seem to get left behind. Quiet children get left at the back,” Dhillon said.Konstantina Pistola, a teacher in the Bethlehem unit, said: “We want our children to be fully part of the school community. We’re trying to build as much independence as possible so that they are ready for society.”With the number of school-age children with EHCPs in England rising to more than 480,000 this year, central and local governments have struggled to keep up, with severe shortages of special school places and long delays causing anger among parents about how their children are being treated.View image in fullscreenThough All Saints is a mainstream secondary school, about 10% of its pupils have an education, health and care plan.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianThe ballooning number of EHCPs has also created a financial timebomb for councils. Most funding for special educational needs (SEN) provision comes via local authority high-needs budgets but those have been in deficit for years, with the combined shortfall estimated to now be £5bn. The only thing keeping more councils from outright insolvency has been the government allowing them to keep these deficits off their balance sheets.Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, has repeatedly said the government needs to “think differently” about special needs provision. Exactly what Phillipson means is not yet clear. The details are still being thrashed out in Whitehall, with the Treasury taking a close interest in the cost implications, and theDepartment for Education(DfE) struggling internally to develop coherent policy after years of neglect.It seems likely that EHCPs will not survive in their current form, with existing plans phased out over two or more years. Ministers and officials argue that a better solution is for mainstream state schools to educate more children with special needs. That is where All Saints’ Bethlehem unit comes in.While some mainstream state schools have SEN units or specialist provision, what makes All Saints unusual is the high number of its 900 pupils who have EHCPs. The percentage is about 2% for the average school in England.Andrew O’Neill, All Saints’ headteacher, said: “If we look at this school, about 10% of our children have EHCPs, that’s one of highest rates in the country for a mainstream secondary. It means that this school has to be set up to work for all children of all needs. We have to make sure that they can succeed.”O’Neill said the “morally right” approach was for every school to enable pupils with special needs and disabilities to access the same teaching, schoolwork and activities as their peers. “It’s about raising attainment and supporting them as well as showing that you have high aspirations for these pupils,” O’Neill said.“You’ve got to have high standards, the pupils deserve that from the point of view of dignity. High standards should go hand in hand with a joyful experience of school.”O’Neill has now been appointed as Phillipson’s special adviser on schools on a 12-month secondment that the DfE said will bring “frontline expertise directly into the heart of policymaking”.Pistola explains that the Bethlehem unit can offer specialist provision to children with a wide range of conditions including autism and ADHD.“We have to tackle each student’s individual needs. For example some students have lots of energy and we have to recognise that, while others want quiet. We are able to be more flexible around student behaviour,” Pistola said.View image in fullscreenBridget Phillipson, the education secretary, wants the government to ‘think differently’ about special needs provision.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesWhile some pupils have all their teaching within the unit, those able to study GCSE-level subjects such as sciences or maths are taught in mainstream classes, where All Saints’ innovative structure means they receive help from academic support assistants (ASAs), used in place of traditional teaching assistants to support SEN pupils.O’Neill said: “Academic support assistants are experts in their subjects, while teaching assistants are typically attached to a single student and follow them through every lesson. The ASAs can offer more technical help for their subjects rather than just for one person.”Government faces battle over Send overhaul as campaigners voice fearsRead moreChester Smith, a recent graduate who has joined All Saints as an ASA, said he would typically be in a lesson overseeing pupils who need support, checking their understanding, and working with those who were unable to be in the classroom.“Most often within the class I’m circulating, making sure I talk to the key students I need to talk to first. I’m operating around the room and I can reach more students than a typical teaching assistant,” Smith said.“There are some kids who can be really challenging but I’ve enjoyed it more than I expected – the work is so stretching and fast-paced.”Charlotte Healy, whose son Jamal has an EHCP, says she appreciates many of the small things that All Saints is able to do, with teachers on hand at the end of the school day to direct children home through the busy streets of west London, as well as giving regular updates on their progress.“For parents like us, you’re constantly thinking: are they OK? Are they getting on? Are they making friends, are they with the rest of their peers? That’s a big thing for parents of children with education and health care plans,” said Healy.“When you do find an environment like this, where it is really good and with the staff to help them grow, you know they care because you get those phone calls and the updates, which are so lovely to hear.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsSchoolsEducation policyDepartment for EducationSecondary schoolsBridget PhillipsonEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Experts debunk the most common misconceptions about your sex lifePaisley GilmourFri 11 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 14.11 EDTShareSex = penetrationAsked to define sex, most people will say it means penetration and anything else is just “foreplay”, explains Kate Moyle, apsychosexual and relationship therapist, and author ofThe Science of Sex. “This pedestals intercourse as ‘real sex’ and other sexual acts as something donebeforepenetration rather than as deserving credit in their own right,” she says.Lesbian, bisexual and gay peopletend to havea broader definition. Sex education historically revolved around reproduction (therefore penetration), which is just one ofhundreds of reasonspeople have sex.If you think of penetration as the sex you “should” be having, you might be missing out on the sex you genuinely enjoy. Whether you’re in a penetration rut or tend to have sex the same way, challenge your idea of what intercourse means: “Whenever you have sex, change one small thing – lights on/off, starting with your clothes on/off, a different position, or agreeing not to have penetrative sex,” Moyle suggests. “Novelty can be a real boost for our sex lives.”If your partner doesn’t get an erection or get wet, they’re not attracted to you“Our culture treats the body like a lie detector test,” says Dr Emily Jamea, asex and relationship therapistand author ofAnatomy of Desire: Five Secrets to Create Connection and Cultivate Passion. We’re fed the idea that arousal is instant, automatic and visible, “but bodies are not machines, and things like stress, medications, trauma, hormones or feeling pressured to perform can affect its response”, she adds.Aspsychosexual and relationship therapistJames Earl puts it: mind and body don’t always play nice. “Men sometimes get an erection without being turned on, just like women may lubricate without feeling desire. The reverse is also true: you can feel aroused without the physical manifestation,” he explains.Try not to take the absence of a partner’s erection or wetness as a personal rejection. “It may signal that someone needs a bit more time, safety or stimulation,” Jamea says. “Slow things down, check in and focus on what feels good, not just what ‘should’ be happening in the moment,” she adds.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kellie French/The Guardian. Makeup by Sarah Cherry using Givenchy Beauty. Model: Alex G at Hired HandsPorn ruins your sex lifeExperts are divided on the impact porn has on our sex lives, and even how addictive it really is. “Some people may watch porn compulsively, but it’s not because porn is addictive,” says Silva Neves, apsychosexual psychotherapistandauthor. “It’s often because they have other underlying emotional difficulties (most often depression) that they’re trying to soothe.”But Alex Warden, a lead therapist at the Priory hospital, Chelmsford, who supports an increasing number of patients being referred to him with pornography addiction, says compulsive viewing can damage a relationship if taken to extremes. “Partners usually feel betrayed and hurt, which can result in a breakdown of communication and intimacy. This tends to be wrapped up in a lot of confusion, shame and a host of mental health issues,” he says.However, Neves points out: “Porn is not a monolith. There are multiple types of porn, some undesirable and misogynistic, and some very good ethical types.”If you are an avid viewer, he adds, it’s best to be as open as possible and choose a partner who has similar values around it: “Make sure you watch it in a way that’s pleasurable, matches your own values and allows you to communicate your porn enjoyment with your partner without shame,” he says.Only men get sexual performance anxietyThis can affect everyone, regardless of sex or gender. Areview of studiesconducted across 18 years found up to 25% of men and 16% of women experience performance anxiety.The symptoms are often more obvious if you have a penis: not being able to get or maintain an erection, and premature ejaculation. With vulvas, it may present as reduced lubrication, pelvic floor tightness, reduced pleasure or inhibited orgasm, Moyle explains.The anxiety is often rooted in limited, gendered messages we receive about sex. “We feel that if we don’t ‘succeed’, we’ll be judged and shamed; or we believe we’ve failed to meet our partner’s (or our own) expectations,” she says.If you have performance anxiety and a regular partner, tell them what’s going on and offer a specific suggestion for what could help. “Where we have communication gaps we fill the spaces with assumptions, which often hold a negative bias, but pretending it isn’t happening is likely to worsen the anxiety,” advises Moyle. If a specific sex act or position is making you anxious, put a pause on it. “It’ll give you a chance to refocus your attention on what is working and feeling good,” she adds.You’re naturally either good or bad at sexJamea says sexual skills are something we all have to learn and work at. “I believe we’re born with the fundamentals that we need to be good lovers, but things happen in our lives – we’re influenced by culture or have a negative experience that disconnects us from those innate qualities.”Good sex isn’t about a talented performance. “It’s about how good a communicator you are, how safe you make your partner feel and how deeply you’re able to connect with them,” she says.Whether you think you’re good or bad at sex, having a fixed mindset kills experimentation and prevents growth. Jamea says there’s one question you should ask during sex if you want to be truly great: what feels best for you? “That simple question can turn it into a collaborative experience where you’re co-creators and active participants with the shared goal of making it better for everyone.”Sex stops when you get olderAnAge UK studyfound 54% of men and 31% of women over 70 are still sexually active. Yet “older people are viewed as sexless by our society, media and the medical community”, says Joan Price, anadvocate for “ageless sexuality” and the author ofNaked at Our Age: Talking Out Loud About Senior Sex.“With a spirit of creativity and communication, we can be sexual beings lifelong,” she continues. “Yes, sex changes as we age: we just need to learn to explore new ways of making sexual arousal work for us.”If what you used to do isn’t physically possible any more, Price suggests taking turns. “Instead of being frustrated that you can’t find one activity that works for both of you, enjoy double the pleasure by giving and receiving separately.” For partnered and solo senior sex, incorporate vibrators into your sex life. “They speed up arousal and are often the difference between orgasm or not.”Penis size is importantOnly55% of straight menand62% of gay and bisexual mendon’t feel anxious about their penis size. “For men especially, there is the belief that the bigger it is the more pleasurable sex will be,” saysintimate health expertDr Shirin Lakhani. Yetthe majorityof straight women say they don’t care about penis size, and85% are happywith what their partner is packing. After all, pleasure comes down to much more than the length of a penis.If your penis size causes anxiety, share with your sexual partner how you’re feeling. “Even if society has made you feel uncomfortable about discussing penis size, your partner should be understanding and reassuring. There are of course other ways to enjoy sex that don’t focus on penis size,” says Lakhani, who suggests oral sex or using your hands.People only use sex toys if their partner can’t satisfy themThis myth comes from the belief that sex toys can do things partners can’t, and are therefore “better”.Think of sex toys as tools, not threats. “They offer something different to partnered sex. The two are not mutually exclusive,” says Moyle. Miranda Christophers, asex and relationship psychotherapistand clinical director atThe Therapy Yard, agrees that they can create different sensations, enhance exploration, add variety and playfulness, boost connection, and help people overcome sexual function issues.Moyle advises: “If you’re new to sex toys choose a simple vibrator, and trail it all over the body – not just focusing on the parts associated with sex. This can help build anticipation, desire and arousal.”Only gay men like anal sex“Heterosexual men tend to believe that anal sex is a ‘gay thing’,” says Neves. “This myth comes from poor sex education and gay male stereotypes, which can contribute to homophobia.”Anal sex can be enjoyed by anybody, regardless of sex, gender or sexuality. “Numerous heterosexual men enjoy receiving anal sex. It stimulates the prostate (a gland found between the penis and rectum), which can be very pleasurable,” says Neves.Still, some men feel shame just for being curious about anal sex, and are less likely to seek information on how to practise it safely. “Start slowly, because the lining of the anus is delicate. Access information on douching, and use plenty of lube,” Neves advises. “You can start by trying a sex toy specifically designed for prostate massage to experiment with how it feels for you. Take it one step at a time.”Your sex drive is either high or low“The word ‘drive’ is a misnomer,” Jamea says. “It’s better understood as a motivational system that orients us towards pleasure, connection, novelty or emotional closeness.” Sexual desire is a lot more complex than the drive that comes from hunger or thirst. It also isn’t static and can be shaped by context, stress, hormones, relationship dynamics, how much sleep you’ve had and how emotionally safe you feel with a partner.Jamea suggests trying to think of your sex drive as like a compass that points you towards what helps you feel most alive and connected. “Rather than asking, ‘Am I in the mood right now?’, ask what conditions – individually, relationally or environmentally – could help me feel more open to desire.”Explore more on these topicsSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His childhood coaches, fans and the 79-year-old widow who collapsed during one of his matches certainly think so.The 22-year-old Spaniard, who is riding a 24-match win streak, has spent the last fortnight charming spectators and players alike – and not just with his tennis skills.The five-time grand slam champion has won hearts as well as matches at Wimbledon, where he reached the finals for the third consecutive year, afterdefeating the US player Taylor Fritzin four sets on Friday.Kiko Navarro, Alcaraz’s former coach in his home town of El Palmar, a village in Murcia, is not surprised by the star’s good manners or popularity. “His happiness in his face, which he spreads to the spectators, it was the same when he was a child,” he says.A young Carlos Alcaraz with his then coach, Kiko Navarro, in his home town of El Palmar, Murcia, Spain.Photograph: Kiko Navarro“He has always been a humble person. Since he was little, when we would go to play, people would look at us and see that he was the best. And I liked to think that, well, if one day he becomes a tennis player, he would keep that humility, that closeness he has with people – and that is why he has won over all the public.”Alcaraz’s acts of kindness atWimbledonhave been plentiful and well documented, often neatly translating into bite-size clips that go viral on social media. They include handing over his signed shirt to his Italian opponent Fabio Fognini’s son, Federico, who is a huge fan, and making time to say hello to the four-year-old son of the retired Spanish player Feliciano López, who was at SW19 for the invitation doubles.Alcaraz also appeared to be the first person to spot 79-year-oldDelyth Lewis struggling in the heatin the fifth hour of his five-set epic against Fognini. Alcaraz rushed to the umpire to halt the game before picking up his own water bottles and going to her aid when she fainted. This week the retired bank worker said she was “truly grateful” for his actions: “I’m his number one fan and I hope he lifts the trophy on Sunday.”View image in fullscreenAlcaraz hands over a water bottle after Delyth Lewis fainted during his first-round match at Wimbledon.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAAlcaraz will face either Novak Djokovic or the world No 1, Jannik Sinner, on Sunday before next month’s US Open, where he will also play mixed doubles with the British No 1, Emma Raducanu, whohe has affectionately said is “going to be the boss”.Navarro said Alcaraz’s good deeds were not for the cameras or sponsorship deals, of which he has many. “It shows that he is a very sensitive person,” he said. “He loves those kind of gestures.“These are things that come from the heart, which are not things that he does to win over people or brands. He has all his contracts, everything is perfect, but the truth is that he knows how to help people. He has his foundation here in Murcia, Fundación Alcaraz, to help the poorest children, and he loves it, he loves to help people.”The consensus was the same among tennis insiders who this week said that what you saw was what you got with Alcaraz, which cannot be said for all players.View image in fullscreenAlcaraz hugs Fabio Fognini at the end of their first-round match at Wimbledon.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesAlcaraz often speaks generously of his opponents after defeating them on the courts. On Tuesday he described the former British No 1 Cameron Norrie as “an amazing guy”, adding: “No one works harder than him andit is nice to see him fighting for great things.”He also only had warm words to say about the qualifier Oliver Tarvet, whohe beat in straight sets, predicting that the British 21-year-old could go on to achieve great things. He later commented on an Instagram post of Tarvet’s, saying: “Great run man, keep going.”Carlos Santos, who coached Alcaraz from the ages of five to 12, said he had always been polite. “He was always a nice boy. He was magic. He was always smiling. He was a special boy. When Carlos was only 10 years old we travelled around Europe together, and he never caused any problems in the hotel or in matches. He’s different,” he recalled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And that was no different at Wimbledon on Friday morning. “I feel really good,” said a beaming 13-year-old Zoe McCallum, clutching a signed tennis ball Alcaraz had just given her. “He’s just very good at tennis,” she said in answer to why she was a huge fan.The schoolgirl and her father, Gavin McCallum, were among hundreds of spectators who had lined up to watch Alcaraz practise on court 16 at 11am before the Spaniard’s semi-final clash against Fritz.As well as handing out balls to his youngest admirers at the end of his session, Alcaraz patiently waved and smiled at the hordes who took photos of him and shouted: “Vamos Carlos! We hope you win!”McCallum, 50, who had travelled from Glasgow, said: “He’s the new generation. Everybody loved Rafa [Rafael Nadal] but he’s going to be the new Spanish king of tennis. He’s got really good charisma. He’s in the middle of getting ready for the semi-final and he gave my daughter a signed tennis ball. He’s a man of the people. He seems really down to earth; he’s not too up himself and he’s taking time to do stuff with fans which is great. He didn’t have to do it but he’s done it.”Young Alcaraz with his childhood coach, Kiko Navarro.Photograph: Kiko Navarro“He’s just incredibly entertaining,” said 17-year-old Sophie Moore, who was also waiting to catch a glimpse of the man of the moment. “And very good looking,” interrupted her friend Lola Moffatt, 16. “Good looking, young and good at tennis,” she added.The students, who hope to have successful tennis careers themselves, said he was the most popular player among their peers. “He’s very personable and humble, compared with other players who are quite immodest,” said Moore.It is why Navarro thinks Alcaraz could be one of the kindest players in the sport. “Because in tennis, unfortunately, there are many – I am not going to say names – but they are not very kind to people. It seems that, in the end, in tennis, the public face is also important for brands and sponsors. That’s why Carlos, as well as from his tennis, his way of being gets him such good contracts, with all the best brands in the world.“But for me what’s important is how Carlitos is, and if Carlitos is kind, that’s enough for me.”Explore more on these topicsCarlos AlcarazWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If only he’d thought about the words a bitRachel AroestiFri 11 Jul 2025 11.50 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 11.51 EDTShareIn the mid-2010s, pop music changed. Instead of hounding the listening public with focus-grouped, machine-tooled crowd-pleasers, the biggest stars began releasing expansive, experimental albums that played to their own tastes and interests. These were records that were artistically self-indulgent, mostly in a good way: Rihanna’s sleazy, sultry Anti, Beyoncé’s densely referential Lemonade, Lady Gaga’s soft-rock-heavy Joanne, Miley Cyrus’s psychedelic Wayne Coyne collaboration Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (I may be the only person who holds that example in such high regard.)View image in fullscreenThe artwork for SwagWith his fourth albumPurpose, Justin Bieber was adjacent to this shift. Leaning into the ascendant tropical house genre, collaborating with Skrillex and pursuing a sound you sensed a 21-year-old might actually like, it spelled the end of Bieber’s career as a cheesy tween idol and repositioned him as a leading figure in the pop zeitgeist. But Purpose still felt like an album designed to spew highly accessible hits. And it did.A decade on, however – after backsliding into forgettable, generic pop on2021’s Justice– Bieber has finally made what seems to be a genuine 2015-style passion project. Swag, the 31-year-old’s surprise-released seventh album, opens extremely promisingly with All I Can Take, a hauntological twist on spotless, energetic 1980s R&B: echoey vocals, fast, faded beats, maudlin synths that seem half-remembered from a dream. Abetted by a songwriting and production team that includes Carter Lang (SZA), Tobias Jesso Jr (Dua Lipa, Adele), Eddie Benjamin, Dylan Wiggins and Daniel Chetrit, the sonic vibe echoes throughout the album.Justin Bieber: Dadz Love ft Lil B – videoIt comes festooned with layered melisma on Butterflies, gated reverb and laser-style synths on the gorgeous Too Long and hyperactive, washed-out drums on First Place. Elsewhere, Bieber’s default sweet and smooth R&B base is counterbalanced by chugging guitar and crashing percussion (the Mk.gee-produced Daisies) and fingers-on-fretboard squeaks of acoustic guitar (the lo-fi Zuma House). Lil B collaboration Dadz Love merges gospelly vocals with a fuzzy breakbeat and blissed-out synths to similarly beautiful effect.It’s all very considered, cleverly nostalgic and subtly satisfying – there’s not a craven chart smash in earshot. Lyrically, however, Swag isn’t such a classy and thoughtful affair. Dadz Love is an inane celebration of Bieber’s nascent fatherhood that essentially just repeats the title into meaninglessness. The other love songs – which are addressed to his wife, Hailey, whose viral lip gloss-holding phone case gets a shout-out on Go Baby – rarely transcend superficial, saccharine cliche. But they are at least preferable to the eye-watering spoken-word segments.The best albums of 2025 so farRead moreDuring a handful of conversations with internet personality Druski, Bieber bemoans the reaction to his discomfitingly intimate social media posts, which have worried fans in recent months (if “people are always asking if I’m OK … it starts to make me feel like I’m the one with issues and everyone else is perfect”). He gets gently ribbed about his altercations with the paparazzi – two examples of which are sampled on this album – and told, sycophantically, that despite his white skin, his musicality is such that he must have a “Black” soul.These cringeworthy interludes show a Bieber determined to refute the unflattering caricature of him that prevails in the tabloid sphere. But you would struggle to find much evidence of a three-dimensional human being in his lyrics, which are low on specifics, insight or originality. Despite the album’s seductive, almost spookily evocative sound, the lasting impression is one of eerie emptiness. Swag has moments of brilliance, but this is no long-awaited masterpiece.Explore more on these topicsJustin BieberPop and rockR&Balbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Foreigners were baffled that it was so often, and I was baffled that it was so infrequent.I said it that many times just going once round Tesco Metro (I can’t even process how many times I’d be sorry in the mega-store):Sorry (you are between me and a basket, you ought to have foreseen this, there is only one basket-station. Now that you haven’t, all we can do is mourn);Sorry (I slightly trod on you);Sorry (you’re clearly one of those people who still observes a one-way system, post-Covid, and even though I plainly disagree with this, otherwise I’d also do it, I sympathise with your vexation);Sorry (you’re going way too fast and that’s why we nearly collided, so really you should be sorry, except you seem a bit high, so I am sorry for your predicament);Sorry (we both reached for the same thing, yet the stakes are low, there are 17 more);Sorry (I joined the queue in the wrong place);Sorry (you joined the queue in the wrong place);Sorry (shop assistant, you are very slow to approve my age-sensitive purchase, considering you could ID me from space);Sorry (that my Clubcard isn’t scanning, person behind me, even though I 100% guarantee that yours isn’t going to scan either).This is why foreigners don’t understand us; not because of “British understatement” or even our fabulous heuristic of saying the opposite of what we mean, but because the word “sorry” has infinite potential meanings – its intention can change in the middle of saying it. Probably – at a maximum – one time in 10 it means “I did wrong, and I apologise”. Maybe predominantly it means “you did wrong, but no hard feelings”. It can mean, “we’ve both slightly transgressed one another’s boundaries, and this is me signalling that life is too short to thrash out a shared norm, while at the same time, not being ready to completely surrender”. And this is just the sorries in a shop, with absolute strangers, no expectations, no consequences.A lot of the sorries identified by linguists are actually so strikingly pass-agg, so much like a punch in the face, that I’d never use them unless I was muttering at the radio (as I was, twice in this two-day experiment: “I’m sorry, Conservative former minister, it’s simply not true that you can self-diagnose a mental illness and then get disability benefits”; “Sorry, gentleman on Magic FM, that isn’t how carbon offsetting works”). It’s like conjugating verbs in ancient Flemish: you can use the sarcastic-correction sorry, but only in these very precise circumstances; in private to yourself; as a joke; or on TV.I stepped out of the house and went for a coffee where, after my first cup, I said a genuine “sorry – can I have another double espresso?” It meant a lot – I would hate to parade my caffeine dependency without shame; I don’t want to put you to a repetitive task five seconds straight after you last did it; yet I do understand commerce, and if I had thought you really minded, I’d have gone with: “I’m really, really sorry.”After that, the gamut of maternal sorries; “sorry you’re too hot” (you are whining, I cannot control the weather); “sorry I didn’t wake you up” (you should have woken yourself up); “sorry there’s no oat milk” (just drink milk). I guess that starts as a jujitsu move, if you apologise enough, they’ll realise that they shouldn’t have complained in the first place? A kind of Basil Fawlty, “the management is processing your complaint, and all he can do is extend his heartfelt contrition, and then have a nervous breakdown”. It doesn’t work, at all. I don’t even know if they know I’m drawing on a deep cultural well of fake apology.Factor in the sorries of the road – hand-signal sorries; eyebrow-yikes, sorry!; more sarcastic “sorry your indicators seem to be broken” – and by the time you sit down to do any kind of work, the currency has been debased, and if you’ve done anything even mildly wrong, that you actually do all the time, like take two days to reply to something, you’re heading towards “so so so so sorry”; “I want to shoot myself in the face, I’m so sorry”.It’s all pretty easy to decode, at least from the inside. The hard thing would be to stop doing it.Explore more on these topicsSocial etiquetteLanguagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nobody in tennis can spot a Moment likeNovak Djokovic. The Moment is where he lives, breathes, puts gluten-free food on his family’s table. What happened before was irrelevant. You can rattle and bully him. You can pummel him off Centre Court for an hour, as Jannik Sinner has done. Djokovic will still prowl the chain-link fence all evening, probing it, waiting for the one gap wide enough to let him squeeze through. The point of greatest weakness is where he finds his greatest strength.Sinner’s at 30-30 on his own serve. A defensive backhand from Djokovic sits up invitingly in mid-court, pleading to be dispatched. The world No 1, utterly impeccable to this point, swings a giant fist at the ball and somehow sends it flying in the vague direction of Tooting Broadway. The crowd yelps in shock. Next point Sinner nets a weak forehand, Djokovic raises a fist of defiance, and in the space of a few minutes – plus a few extra for the now-traditional Djokovic treatment break – this particular Italian job has had its bloody doors blown off.Sinner dismantles ailing Djokovic to set up Wimbledon final against AlcarazRead moreAnd because of what Djokovic was, these moments still feel like they might mean something. Nobody ever got rich writing off the most decorated men’s player in history. But because of what Djokovic now is, these moments are so often also illusory: flickering candles of defiance in a gathering storm. Briefly rattled, Sinner collected himself, remembered he was by far the superior player, regained the break and resumedhis regal march to a first Wimbledon final.You may be tempted to posit that a grand slam semi-final is a very commendable effort, indeed a borderline-superhuman feat at 38, an age where most former champions are making their first acquaintance with Mansour Bahrami in the invitational doubles on court three. But of course this is why you are not Novak Djokovic and Novak Djokovic is: not just a perfectionist but a completist, a man who always dealt not in moments but in monuments.And on what has become his most comfortable surface, this may have been the momentProject 25 was buried for good. This was meant to go long and deep. Djokovic was going to make it painful, make it heavy, hang in there, use his experience and slowly turn the screw against an injury-hampered Sinner. Instead he was carved up in less than two hours, dominated – shockingly so – on every metric, and in one other important aspect too. Even in defeat, Djokovic could drag you into the pain zone, force you on to his turf, make you play to his rhythm.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic had a glimmer of hope in the third set before Jannik Sinner showed his power and finished off the match.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBut now the angles don’t seem to exist any more. The court feels bigger under his feet. Sinner was imperious on his serve, hitting Djokovic out of the rallies, forcing the greatest baseline player of all time away from his place of safety. And Djokovic without the baseline is basically like Hendrix without a guitar, or telling Wes Anderson he can’t use a whip pan. By the end, the ultimate back-court hustler wasn’t even bothering to chase every ball down, not even the very last, put away by Sinner as Djokovic trudged sadly back to his seat.And for all the court craft and tactical nous, the matchplay skills and the iron will, ultimately Djokovic’s main point of difference was his body: those ridiculous splaying limbs, the awesome power coiled up in that slender frame, the engine that never seemed to tire, those lightning bursts of speed when it felt like the court might catch fire under him. Djokovic at his most powerful was like playing a giant animatronic spider, a physical advantage so severe it felt like a kind of category difference.Back in his imperial phase he would regard his defeats as learning experiences, rocket fuel for his inevitable next triumph. But now there is no inevitability. Nobody knows how much “next” remains. He has 10 members of staff devoted to curating his life in tennis, everything from tactics to training to nutrition to recovery. “Sometimes I get tired of all the chores I have to do on a daily basis,” he said this week. Instead it is Sinner on the steep learning curve, a player who claims to have taken more from Djokovic’s game than anybody on tour: the consistency, the relentlessness, the bravery. He even seems to have pilfered the famous Djokovic slide, evidence of a machine intelligence set on decrypting the game’s every remaining puzzle.Jelena Djokovic always used to joke that if her husband ever had a spare 10 minutes, he would invariably spend it stretching: calves, hamstrings, shoulders, side body. Now, it’s time he’s trying to stretch out. One more gym session, one more grand slam, one more season, one more step up the mountain of immortality. ThisWimbledonfelt like his best chance of burgling one last big pot. Instead, his defeat has simply underlined the broadening chasm between the Big Two and the man they once tried to chase down.What happens now is anyone’s guess. The perfectionist in Djokovic will surely not allow him to drift through men’s tennis as a vapour of his former self, grimacing his way through painful second-round defeats as his former coach Andy Murray forced himself to do. But thecompletist in him will surely not be content to end itlike this: ground into the dirt in three short sets by a monster he helped to create. There may be more moments. There may just be one more big run. But even for Djokovic, time will not stretch for ever.Explore more on these topicsNovak DjokovicWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisanalysisShareReuse this content"

Lord’s on a brutally hot July morning can feel like an assault on the senses, with its crush of pastel-shirted flesh, the walkways seething with food wafts, hamper-flash, ice-bucket envy.The home of cricket had at least immersed itself fully in the Red for Ruth charity on day two of this third Test, laying on an endless rolling field of red trouser cloth, every shade from faded salmon to screw-you scarlet on show. Admittedly it was like this on day one too. But you can never have enough charity.‘This is a 10-over ball? Seriously?’ India reignite Dukes ball row over quality at Lord’sRead moreAbove all Lord’s has a kind of social fever on days like these, the shared urge to get beyond the next velvet rope, to find the furthest secret garden, like supplicants at some blue-moccasined royal court.In the middle of this there was something beautifully stark about the sight of Jasprit Bumrah out in the middle of that sun-baked green oval, a cricketer operating from inside his own cold clean square of light. With a Test to be seized and a legacy to be glossed, Bumrah duly produced, taking three for one in six balls in his opening spell, completing the scheduled five-fer, and in the process his own ascent to the panelled wall coverings of St John’s Wood.Mainly, Bumrah at Lord’s was just utterly thrilling to watch. As ever he came stuttering in like a man on an imaginary pantomime horse clopping his own coconut halves, bowling leg-cutters, inswing and throat-searing bouncers with no shift of action or grip. In the process India’s premier seamer justified even further the decision to rest him for the win in Leeds. And also confirmed what seems now to be unavoidably true: that he is, on numbers, skill and pure spectacle, perhaps the greatest fast bowler of all time; and certainly the best yet across the three modern formats.Bumrah didn’t really produce anything out of the ordinary here. There is no need when your ordinary is sui generis brilliance on all surfaces, all formats, all conditions, the portable Bumrah-shaped universe. A final haul of five for 74 in 27 overs offered the guilty pleasure, mid-Test, of poring over that career record once again.Bumrah now has 215 wickets at an average below 19.5, the lowest of anyone ever to take 200 or more, at least at this stage in his career. Basically right now it’s just Bumrah and SF Barnes out there running ahead of the tideline, with only Malcolm Marshall, Joel Garner and Curtly Ambrose anywhere near.View image in fullscreenJasprit Bumrah is a mystery fast bowler operating in a field of one.Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty ImagesThere are odd elements to these numbers. Bumrah has played only 12 home Tests (his record would be better with more: he averages 17 in India) compared with 34 away from home. He’s also getting better. In the last two years he has 87 Test wickets at 15. In November in Perth he basically pulled Marnus Labuschagne apart like a curious child taking the tweezers to a desiccated woodlouse, en route to five for 10 in nine overs, surely the most relentlessly magical fast bowling spell of the modern age.We can say it now. This is unique, next-level stuff, all the more striking because Bumrah is, that rarest of all things, a mystery fast bowler, out there operating in a field of one. At Lord’s it was a day to marvel at how he does it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The run-up is still a vital source of rhythm and timing, for all its stutters and starts, the ball carefully cradled, like a man running for the last bus at 3am with a kebab doggedly lodged under his elbow. But the run-up exists to wheel that hyperextending right arm into place, wrist perfectly coiled, head still.There’s a glide and a gather and a self-catapult through the crease, ending in the follow-through with Bumrah’s right hand slapping his own buttocks between his legs. It is of course no surprise that growing up in Ahmedabad he was at first unable to break into the age-group teams due to the self-made oddity of this action. Equally unsurprising, it didn’t last long. Above all Bumrah is just a super-smart cricketer, a sponge for information, a student of lines and angles, always in control, jarringly happy in his work, and more muscled now in his pomp, with the look of the handsome contented man in a barber shop window advert.Three of his five wickets in England’s first innings here were top order batters clean bowled – Joe Root, Harry Brook and Ben Stokes, numbers one and two in the world plus the skipper. These were genuinely clean bowled too, defensive shots beaten, techniques pulled apart. Stokes was first to go in Bumrah’s second over, off stump clanked back by a ball angled in on a perfect not-quite length. Next, Root was bowled middle stump via the same process: angled in, holds its line, too flat, quick, perfectly pitched.Chris Woakes nicked behind. Finally Jofra Archer was also bowled, and also seemed to lose the length, completely outmanoeuvred by that snaking, fizzing trajectory. In between Bumrah was slapped around a little by Brydon Carse, who batted with heart and skill to take England to a promising 387. But this was Bumrah’s morning, Bumrah’s asterisk, his one-man Lord’s Friday matinee.Explore more on these topicsIndia cricket teamEngland v India 2025CricketEngland cricket teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the past that has often been a poisoned chalice, but ­Vauquelin has taken it in his stride. Vingegaard is fourth overall, more than a minute behind.Even Pogacar has welcomed younger rivals, such as Vauquelin and Britain’s Oscar Onley, who was third on Mûr-de-Bretagne and lies seventh and showing consistent form in his second Tour. “There’s a lot of professionalism already at a young age,” he said. “To see young guys coming through is good, ­especially Kevin in the last two days.“He has great support and Oscar Onley showed already how bright he is, with a punchy kick. He’s riding super well.”Pogacar did not have a flawless afternoon, with his key climbing support, João Almeida, crashing at speed less than 6km from the finish as the peloton descended towards the second and final climb of the Mûr.“It’s beautiful to be in yellow and win the stage,” Pogacar said, who dedicated his win to his Portuguese teammate. “It was a luxury to have João so close on GC. I hope it’s nothing broken and he can continue.”View image in fullscreenThe success of Frenchman Kevin Vauquelin has captured the host nation’s affections at the start of this year’s Tour de France.Photograph: Dario Belingheri/Getty ImagesHe has others he can lean on, such as the tall, powerful Nils Politt, who Pogacar calls “Giraffe”, but he will need Almeida when the race reaches the first long climbs next Monday on the stage to Puy de Sancy.On another hot afternoon it took 70km for a break to establish itself after a volatile opening to the stage. Geraint Thomas was joined in the mid-stage break by EF Education-EasyPost’s Alex Baudin, teammate toThursday’s winner, Ben Healy, as the American team sought another stage victory.Thomas’s escape ended 17km from the finish when he was caught on the first ascent of the Mûr. But after a ­disappointing start from Ineos ­Grenadiers, the Welshman had at least got “stuck in”, to use his own phrase.On the fast approach to the finishing circuit, centred on the dead straight two kilometre ramp of the Mûr, Pogacar’s UAE Emirates and Vingegaard’s Visma Lease-a-bike yet again jostled for supremacy. As the mercury rises, so is the tension between the two squads.“The last two days, it was some strange racing from Visma,” Pogacar said. “Let’s see their approach in the next days. The weekend will be easier and then stage 10 will be a proper hard day of suffering with hot temperatures and lots of climbs all day.”Stage eight is definitely one for the sprinters, with only a gentle fourth category climb on the 171km route from Saint-Meen-Le-Grand to Laval.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarTour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

[An appeal] is one option.“I think what we would much prefer is if somebody intervened in this process.

One more warm-up match against a tasty lookingAustralia and New Zealand invitational sideand then into the real thing. The Lions head coach, Andy Farrell, was asked how much he was holding back for the Test series and he replied it was exactly the same amount as Australia were. I’d expect nothing less.To give a sense of what that means, it’s not as if he’s asking players to give 80% of their capacity or that the Lions will be unrecognisable come the Test series. The framework they have been working with is the one they will use. But it’s the details where the Lions will try to hurt Australia that have been, to a degree, parked or kept back. You don’t necessarily want to show that in warm-up matches, certainly not your full hand.‘Lions is best thing I’ve ever done,’ says Ben Earl as Test wannabes search for elusive sparkRead moreIn 2009, while we were playing the provincial matches in the buildup, the framework of how we were going to play got layered on and became more detailed with each game, even every day in the buildup to the Test matches. We had specific areas where we believed we could hurt the Springboks that we kept up our sleeve. That could be a kick-off, for example, so it was interesting to see theLions switching things up against the Brumbies, going down the middle and using Tommy Freeman as the main chaser. That kind of thing, or trick moves and trick plays, I thought the Lions might hold back until the Tests.Even accounting for the Lions holding things back, they would have been hoping for more against the Brumbies. It is a good thing no one in the camp was doing cartwheels and I get the impression they recognise that while it’s building, at some point it needs to be built. They are probably behind where I thought they would be, but none of the problems affecting the Lions is terminal.The first thing they need to address is their tendency to start slowly. The Lions have conceded a try inside 11 minutes in four of their five matches. That feeds the energy of their opponents and the concern is that against a team with the threats the Wallabies possess, it may not be just one try and all of a sudden they are up against it and chasing the game. Fast starts need to become a hallmark of this side. They need to build pressure and sustain pressure.View image in fullscreenHugo Keenan will be aiming to make an impression at full-back in the final warm-up game, with injury doubts over Blair Kinghorn.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesThe second area of concern is the breakdown because if you want to be a team who play with ball in hand it means that you want to be comfortable going through multiple phases. International rugby is all about sustained pressure, whether that is at the set piece, in your ball carrying or going through the phases. The Lions are letting teams off the hook because they are not being efficient enough at looking after the ball for enough phases.Some of it comes down to individual responsibility and the worry is that the breakdown problems have become a bit of a pattern. The danger is that if the Lions do want to play multi-phase rugby they are starting to do some of Australia’s homework for them by demonstrating their deficiencies and the Wallabies are a very good side when it comes to the breakdown.There has been plenty to enjoy about the Lions’ performances, but I do wonder if the general sense of clunkiness comes down to the strain the selection battle for the Test side puts them under. Farrell and his coaches will consider everything when it comes to who runs out on Saturday week in Brisbane. Some players will earn their places through experience, others through form. There will be those such as Tadhg Furlong who has been played into a bit of form, others whose form is unignorable, but there will be no guiding principle across the whole side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionEveryone is scrapping like mad for their position and it is unfamiliar to a lot of them. Plenty of players who started against the Brumbies, when they go back to their home nation, are not in as much of a battle for their place. Worrying about selection is not something they need to expend energy on so when we’re seeing players making silly mistakes, not quite at their best, maybe it is because the pressure of selection is huge and it is unfamiliar and weighing heavy. A level of protection that is normally afforded to them has been taken away, there’s more of a pressure to perform and that’s playing out.It is a big ask for most of the starters on Saturday to force their way into the Test team, but that will not stop them trying. A big performance from Jac Morgan could put him in at openside and the two Scotland centres will be desperate for a good showing. Owen Farrell is on the bench, but I do wonder if the Lions will regret not havingJamie Osborne already in campand able to run out because all of a sudden eyes are on Hugo Keenan at full-back.Most importantly, these players have to feel like they can fight their way into the Test team because these Lions haven’t lost in Australia yet and they won’t want to buck that trend.Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsLions tour 2025Australia sportRugby unioncommentShareReuse this content"

Indeed in certain cameos it was almost possible to detect glimpses of the way in which this particular Spanish empire might eventually fall.Italy are not quite good enough to bring them down; not now, not yet. But Andrea Soncin has constructed a smart counterattacking unit that revelled in not merely going toe-to-toe with Spain but demonstrating why their cloak of invincibility contains a few loose threads. Opponents blessed with even greater speed and a more aggressive press should be suitably encouraged.A draw would have been a far from unjust result but, Portugal’s defeat against Belgium, confirmed that Italy are also quarter-finalists. While Spain, as group winners, face Switzerland in the last eight back here in Berne next Friday, Soncin’s team will meet Norway in Geneva on Wednesday.Italy swiftly settled into five at the back mode but, rapid in transition, looked to counterattack at every opportunity and it would have been no surprise had the crossbar developed a significant fissure after Elena Linari thumped the most powerful of early headers against it.Spain failed to heed that warning and paid the price when they failed to clear a low cross. Arsenal’s Mariona Caldentey for once displayed a heavy touch and Italy’s gloriously intrepid right wing-back Elisabetta Oliviero used her left foot to expertly redirect the loose ball into the back of the net.Elisabetta OlivieroIt prompted some prolonged, and extravagant, celebrations but when the dust finally settled, Spain suddenly started playing in the manner of a quietly furious team.TheWorld Cup holdersevidently regarded that goal as an insult to their pride and Real Madrid’s Athenea del Castillo responded by equalising with a first-time shot into the top corner. It followed a sumptuous dribble and one-two with Barcelona’s Alèxia Putellas whose adroit back heel confounded Soncin’s rearguard.Quite apart from repairing wounded egos it took Spain’s goal tally to 12 in three games since arriving in Switzerland while also emphasising that Del Castillo looked the brightest of the half dozen fresh faces Tomé had rotated into her starting XI.Tomé’s side had already qualified for the quarter-finals but their evident irritation whenever Italy slowed the game down – not least as Soncin’s goalkeeper, Laura Giuliani, collapsed with an apparently unfathomable injury that enabled the manager to issue a series of urgent tactical instructions – was real.View image in fullscreenEsther González scores a late third goal for Spain.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APPerhaps such rising tempers proved counter-productive to concentration because Irene Paredes subsequently, and self destructively, handled Sofia Cantore’s cross after making an awful hash of an attempted header.Italy fans were convinced it was a stonewall penalty but a VAR review detected that Cantore had been offside in the preamble and the Barcelona centre-half, Spain’s captain, was duly able to forget one of her rather less distinguished moments.Uefa’s half-time statistics indicated that Spain had completed more than 400 passes, while Italy had managed less than 200. Not that Tomé would be fooled; her team were in a tough match, against extremely awkward opponents with a highly effective style of their own.It had been a hot and sunny day in Berne but, as the second half began, those fans who had made their way to the Wankdorf Stadium in shorts and T-shirts started pulling on emergency jackets and jumpers.Soncin though suddenly started feeling the heat. He needed nothing more than his fitted white shirt and tie as Del Castillo ran, slalom style, through his defensive chicane and Martina Lenzini’s weak clearance headed to Patricia Guijarro.She could hardly pass up such a generous invitation to shoot Spain into the lead and duly did.No matter that it was not exactly the cleanest of hits, Guijarro’s strike still flew in via the inside of a post and Italy seemed to sense an almost palpable shift in the power balance. For the first time on the night La Roja really looked on top.Nonetheless Adriana Nanclares, once again preferred to Cata Coll in goal by Tomé, performed wonders to prevent Cantore’s awkwardly deflected, high velocity, shot restoring parity.Granted Giuliani did well to deny Aitana Bonmatí a chance to celebrate her recovery from meningitis by diverting the latter’s elegantly curving left-foot shot.And, admittedly, Esther González’s close-range stoppage time goal after her connection with Putellas’s sumptuous cross highlighted Spain’s very real threat. But, on this evidence, Tomé’s team do not look unbeatable, let alone unplayable.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballItaly women's football teamSpain women's football teammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They really neededthat displayagainst the Netherlands and it was a pivotal moment for them. It was a very, very commanding performance.Physically, they showed their dominance and exposed the Netherlands’ weaknesses at the back. With Lauren James, in what I think is her best position, playing from the right and being able to drift in, you can maintain your midfield structure. Her performance showed whySarina Wiegmanhas selected her and the team performance showed why she stuck with the group that she did.England at Euro 2025: Wiegman gets key decisions right to give Lionesses hope | Tom GarryRead moreI want to give a special mention to Ella Toone, coming into the side. Tooney seems like she is in the most confident place she has ever been in. She seems ready to perform at the highest level, which bodes well for England. For me the standout performer is always Alessia Russo, with the way she connects, links up and is a constant threat. In addition she’s also a provider of goals for others. All in all that team performance has really reminded England of their levels they are capable of – and they know they have to sustain it.Now, with so many decisive matches on the horizon in the next few days, every team in this tournament will need to do everything they can to maintain harmony within their bubbles and recognise when individuals need a mental breather for a morning coffee or who needs an arm around their shoulder, and these are the times where your senior leaders step up.What I’ve learnt over the years is that if you get a bit of time off while you’re away with the team for so long, you must take it. You need to know how to top your own tank up and, when your tank starts to empty, it’s your responsibility to keep it full. Nobody else is going to do that for you, you have to do that for yourself. If I get a morning off, I like to go shopping, or if I’m in a new town I like to go sightseeing. I want memorable experiences.Sometimes I’ll go to a museum or get my nails done, but it always involves walking, I love walking. Or sometimes it’s about watching a film. Some others will simply want to go for a coffee or maybe they will want to spend their time with family if they can.View image in fullscreenLauren James was playing in her best position, drifting in from the right.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersAs coach you have to remember that everyone has their own different routines and that they are adults. I like to treat them like adults. Any player returning from international duty will tell you, the worst environments are the ones that create cabin fever, where you have to do everything together all the time, that’s when it can drive players mad. If you, figuratively speaking, strangle players during a tournament, that can have such a negative impact on performances. So I’m not a fan of seating plans or precisely fixed times when you all have to sit down for a meal.Then there’s social media. When you are away together as a group for a long time, if you’re too active on social media, it can have such a detrimental impact on the psyche for players and I strongly encourage a detox, for everybody, during that period where they – in an ideal world – have no interactions with social media for a month, and really lock in for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to try to win something like a major tournament.Somebody once advised me: ‘Don’t listen to someone you wouldn’t take advice from’I’ve seen what happens when players do look at social media too much during an intense period, and I don’t think it improves their position at all. On the plus side, though, those who have a healthy boundary with it during tournaments are usually the ones who perform. England had such a high after the Euros, and since then they’ll have had to deal with some of the negativity which comes with that growth. That is not fun and unfortunately some players will look at it, so I’d say the most important thing is to keep emphasising the importance of that “bubble”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We all have a tendency to just focus on form on the field. Part of what you need in challenging times is senior players, while the support staff and the psychologists come into play too. We have seen this week how well the Lionesses have responded.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman’s team selection was vindicated against the Netherlands.Photograph: Florencia Tan Jun/Uefa/Getty ImagesWhen we talk about bubbles, it’s about locking down, protecting everyone’s confidence, and not playing anything out in the public eye, so that nothing damages the team. Do things that don’t create any stress, keep it calm and keep it relaxed, because having 40 days together with the same people can be so intense. Naturally, you can irritate each other, but you also can be the best of friends. The key to it is consistency every day, because you’re going to lose games of football and you’re going to not play well occasionally. But are you set up to be able to cope with it? That’s always the burning question I have. In England’s case, Sarina has got a lot of experience of doing this and will be calm.Somebody once advised me: “Don’t listen to someone you wouldn’t take advice from.” People think they know what’s going on inside a team, without really knowing, and everyone has got an opinion. So as a coach, it’s lovely to just focus only on your team and not listen to others. Yes, you have press officers who will fill you in on what’s being said, but during my experience at the Olympics with the US, I had to think: “I may never have this experience again,” so I wanted us to make the most of it.You have to give everything you can to be the best you can be to perform every day. In this tournament, Spain, Germany and France all caught the eye too, and the reigning world champions look like the top team so far. For France, it was always a matter of not “if”, but “when” we would see them look strong. But can they do it for every game in the tournament? That remains to be seen. There are some fantastic teams in this tournament and the ones who get the bubble right will usually be the ones who succeed.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamWomen’s Euro 2025Sarina WiegmanWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

Bradley’srecent winon the PGA Tour means he is poised to take on a dual role as the US tries to regain the cup from Europe at Bethpage in September. Advantage Europe?A year ago at the Scottish Open,McIlroy insistedthe concept of a playing captain was a seriously flawed one. After posting a 65 on Friday to fire himself into contention at the tournament’s 2025 edition, McIlroy addressed the same issue with a laugh. “Hopefully it is impossible,” he said of a playing captain.The Open organisers agree to use of Spidercam on 18th green at PortrushRead moreMcIlroy was more serious when in praise of Bradley. “Keegan has played great, he’s had a great year. I’m not in those conversations and, from an outside perspective, it’s going to be interesting to see what the US team does with that.“I definitely think the US team is better with Keegan playing than not playing. He’s one of the best 12 American players right now. It’s going to be an interesting couple of months to see how that all shakes out.”McIlroy’s broader assessment of the scenario was more striking. In Europe, Luke Donald is heavily empowered as the captain. “It’s a different perspective, absolutely,” McIlroy said. “It really feels like it’s a player-led team in America. We have our input as players on the European team, but we do have that one figurehead in Luke. I think that’s important.“Even going backto Rome, when the Americans got off to a pretty rough start, because Zach [Johnson] gave the team so much ownership they had no one to look to. They were looking at each other instead of having a focal point: ‘Tell us what to do.’ That is something Europe has done very, very well. But also the players have allowed the captain to be a captain as well.”View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy shot a 65 in his second round at the Scottish Open.Photograph: Warren Little/Getty ImagesMcIlroy’s five-under-par round and minus-seven total at the Renaissance Club means he is four adrift of Chris Gotterup, who carded a stunning 61. Matt Fitzpatrick’s 63 moved him to eight under.“I am excited for the weekend right in the thick of things, in contention going into the last two days,” McIlroy said. “You know that’s where, if there is anything you need to work on in your game, it’s going to show when you’re under that sort of pressure trying to win . I’m looking forward to that.”Golf’s official world-ranking body has confirmed LIV has resubmitted a bid to be included in the system. Players on the LIV Tour have been unable to earn ranking points since its inception in 2022.“LIV’s application will be reviewed in accordance with OWGR’s criteria to ensure fairness, integrity and consistency,” said Trevor Immelman, the chair of the rankings board.Explore more on these topicsRyder CupRory McIlroyGolfUS sportsLIV Golf SeriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Injuries, poor performances and mounting pressure on Wellens himself has led many to feel that there was next to no chance of this side being in the picture for Old Trafford come the autumn: but things change quickly in the wild world of Super League.Origin’s series-defining moment offers an antidote to rugby league’s performative masculinity | Jonathan HowcroftRead moreFive victories in a row have propelled the Saints from the fringes of the playoffs to the lofty heights of third, overtaking the side they defeated here with a spirited display that felt so much more than two competition points. In many ways, it could prove to be season-defining.Few would have given the Saints a chance against a Leeds side buoyed bytheir victory at the league leaders, Hull KR, last week before a ball had been kicked here. Those numbers would have likely dwindled further when Wellens lost both his hookers, Daryl Clark and Jake Burns, to head injuries inside the first half.That left the Saints a man light on the bench in blisteringly warm conditions in West Yorkshire. But they not only emerged victorious here – their seventh straight win at the home of their great rivals – they did so with a character-laden display that underlines this group are playing for their head coach: and they are in the title discussion.There is perhaps still some way to go until we talk about thisSt Helensside as bona fide, red-hot Grand Final contenders. But the very fact they are now, all of a sudden, third in the table with nine rounds remaining means they must be in the conversation.“It was a performance delivered under a hell of a lot of pressure and a heck of a lot of adversity,” Wellens declared post-match. “There are things we need to get better at if we’re to take that next step, but that’s a conversation for another day.”The game’s only try came midway through the first half, when Tristan Sailor and Owen Dagnall combined to send the latter over to break the deadlock. Jonny Lomax would later add a penalty to make it 6-0 but incredibly, that was the night’s scoring over before the half-time hooter.View image in fullscreenLeeds Rhinos’ Kallum Watkins drops the ball as he is tackled by the St Helens defence.Photograph: Lee Parker/CameraSport/Getty ImagesLeeds have made great strides under Brad Arthur and like the Saints, are in the Grand Final discussion. But this was categorically an off night for them, with their star players struggling to unlock a resolute and stern defensive effort from St Helens. They will not look back on this night too fondly.“It was a frustrating 80 minutes,” Arthur said. “We allowed them to frustrate us and with that frustration we had every player trying to come up with something special or win it on their own.”Leeds certainly tried; you can never question their effort under Arthur. But on nights like these, when the opposition are defending for their lives, the Rhinos do need a little bit more of a cutting edge to their game. Not even the late sin-binning of the Saints prop Agnatius Paasi could craft an opening for Leeds to take advantage of.But this night, in truth, belonged to the Saints. Written offfor large periods of the year– perhaps rightly so in some aspects – this could yet prove to be the night where their fans began to believe this could be their year against all the odds.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueLeeds RhinosSt HelensRugby leaguematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Whistlejacket, a Group One winner as a juvenile last season, is a live contender, butFlora Of Bermuda (4.35)also arrives with strong credentials having finished third in the Jubilee at Ascot last month.Andrew Balding’s filly has gone close at the highest level already, still looks to be improving from race to race and is a fair bet at around 5-1 to finally notch a Group One win.Newmarket 1.40This is generally one of the strongest fillies’ maidens of the season and Desert Flower, this year’s 1,000 Guineas winner, was Charlie Appleby’s fifth winner in eight runnings 12 months ago.

Creating a more egalitarian society and politics – which by definition means redistribution from the powerful – was Labour’s original purpose.Britain was then, and remains, a highly unequal country:more unequal currentlythan neighbours such as Ireland, the Netherlands and France. This week the children’s commissioner, Rachel de Souza, said that some British children were living in“almost Dickensian levels of poverty”. But as any expensive but packed restaurant, pavement lined with new Range Rovers or row of smoothly renovated home exteriors will tell you, the rich have been enjoying a long boom in Britain, arguably ever since the Conservatives abolished the top 60% income tax rate 37 years ago.Yet the current Labour government, like others before it, has struggled to devise and promote policies that substantially redistribute wealth. It has proposed or enacted welcome but modest redistributive reforms:removing the tax privilegesof non-doms, imposingVAT on private schools, ending theinheritance tax exemptionfor farmers, removing thewinter fuel allowancefrom wealthier pensioners andreducing the power imbalancebetween landlords and tenants. But amid the huge controversy these policies have caused – itself a sign of better-off citizens’ sense of entitlement – Labour has either made the argument for greater equality too quietly and tentatively, or not at all.This near-silence is surprising in some ways. Populism has familiarised voters again with the idea that elites have too much and the majority too little. Especially in a slow-growing economy, with a government under acute financial strain, politics is often a zero-sum game, where different interests compete for resources. The always revealing British Social Attitudes surveyshows thatthe number of people who believe that “government should redistribute income from the better off to those who are less well off” has risen slowly but steadily over the past 20 years: from under a third to almost half – not an overwhelming proportion, buttwice as largeas the one that currently supports Labour.Yet instead of the assertiveness with which the privileged and their media allies defend the status quo, the government uses bland, nonconfrontational, supposedly unifying language, such as “country first, party second”, and “working people” – rather than the more politically loaded “working class”. Keir Starmer promises voters more “security”, but without saying that much of today’s insecurity is created by employers, and that situation will have to change. Similarly the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, insists that state spending and ordinary people’s living standards can be improved by better productivity and economic growth, but without saying that this transformation could also be achieved, or deepened, through a different distribution of income and wealth.It’s unrealistic to expect centrist politicians to turn into class warriors. But the absence of redistributive arguments from the government’s rhetoric – when it is clearly doing redistributive things – is one of the main reasons this rhetoric seems unconvincing and the government inauthentic. Most voters knowLabouris a party that takes from the more privileged to give to those with less – the clue is in the name – so when it pretends otherwise, it can come across as less than honest, and afraid of its enemies. Such evasiveness also means that the ground is not prepared for when redistributive measures, such as tax rises on the rich, can no longer be avoided, because the government needs the money. This autumn’s budget may turn out to be such a moment.One explanation for Labour’s awkwardness about redistribution lies in the party’s most maligned period in office, the mid-1970s. Facing a deep financial crisis it had partly inherited from the Conservatives – a depressingly familiar scenario – Harold Wilson’s government imposed a combined income and investment tax rate of 98% on the highest earners. Although tax rates were almost as high under postwar Tory governments, it is Wilson’s that remain infamous.Less remembered is the fact that, thanks partly to his tax rises, Britonswere more financially equalin the mid-1970s than they had ever been before, and ever have been since. Yet Labour seemingly received no electoral benefit: at the next general election, in 1979, it was comfortably defeated by Margaret Thatcher’s anti-egalitarian Conservatives.When Labour returned to office 18 years later, its redistributive policies came heavily disguised. A minimum wage and tax credits for low-paid families were presented as ways to boost the economy and spread the work ethic, rather than also as ways for the wealthy to help the less privileged. Meanwhile, Britain’s economic elites received lavish government praise. “We are intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich,” said the key New Labour figure Peter Mandelson in 1998, “as long as they pay their taxes.”UK tax rises in the autumn are essential – but who will pay? | Larry ElliottRead moreThis redistribution by stealth worked well as long as the economy and tax revenues grew healthily, which they did for New Labour’s first 10 years in power. Meanwhile, difficult distributive issues that the party preferred not to think about – the sharply diverging incomes and wealth of Britons, how this polarisation was deepening social divisions, and how these divisions could not be lessened without confronting elites – were largely avoided.Starmer is governing in much tougher times, just as Gordon Brown did, after New Labour’s economic luck finally ran out in the 2008 financial crisis. Brown’s government raised the top income tax rate from 40% to 50%. The media response was almost universally hostile, but in the weeks afterwards Labour’s position stabilised in the polls, a possible early sign of the 21st century’s pro-redistribution shift.This week, speculation that the government will introducea wealth taxhas prompted both strong denials and more ambiguous signals from Downing Street. Some in Labour favour one; others believe that openly egalitarian policies are never wise in what they see as a naturally deferential, hierarchical country.But with the government’s shifty approach to redistribution enraging the right without satisfying the left, and leaving less ideological voters believing that the government is just directionless, Labour is in the worst of all worlds. One way out may be to eat the rich, metaphorically speaking, before the rich eat it.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsInequalityOpinionLabourIncome taxIncome inequalityPovertyTaxcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s more likely to have been created to appease the likes of Nigel FarageFri 11 Jul 2025 11.55 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 11.57 EDTShareFor years, human rights campaigners have been calling for safe routes to the UK for asylum seekers to prevent them from taking dangerous journeys across the Channel in overloaded dinghies, lining the pockets of ruthless people smugglers in the process. So, is Thursday’s announcement of the “one in one out” deal by the UK prime minister and the French president, where one asylum seeker who arrives on a small boat will be sent back to France in exchange for bringing another one to the UK legally, the answer to their prayers?TheUNHCRand theRefugee Councilhave cautiously welcomed the announcement, while acknowledging that full details of how the scheme will work in practice are key and not yet available. Others have been less enthusiastic, with the charity Refugee Action condemning the plan for people in life-or-death situations as similar to anightclub door policy, while Asylum Matters has called it a “Rwanda-style gimmick”.The scale of the pilot scheme is modest – it is likely that about 50 people a week who arrive in the UK on small boats will be returned toFrance, while the same number will be allowed back here. The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has refused to be drawn on exact numbers.What will everyone else do? The UK government says it will detain those it plans to return to France, although some may not depart meekly and may legally challenge their removals. Will others who arrive here but are not to be returned have their asylum claims processed? Or will they be left in limbo, and potentially lose contact with the Home Office?The scheme sounds fiendishly complex in terms of who will be selected. How will the 50 a week be picked? And how will inadmissibility work? The Home Office has said that some small boat arrivals will have their asylum claims deemed inadmissible and will be packed off back to France. But will other small boat arrivals have their claims deemed admissible and be processed at the same time? I put 10 such questions to the Home Office this morning. It has yet to reply.French politicians, including Emmanuel Macron, haverepeatedly blamedthe UK’s lax labour laws for the increasing numbers coming to the UK – more than21,000 so far this year, more than a 50% increase on the same period last year. But that’s not the whole story. According to research from the European parliament cited byBBC Verifyin 2022, 11% of the UK’s total economy was “informal economy” – less than France’s 14% and the 17% average for 31 other European countries. If the opportunity to work illegally is the main magnet, why not go to a European country where there are greater opportunities to do this? The reality is that many of the asylum seekers who come here do so to reunite with family, because they speak the language and because they are attracted by the UK’s record of human rights and fair play.Five key takeaways from Macron’s speech to UK parliamentRead moreKeir Starmer and Macron make the UK sound like a lucrative El Dorado for those who want to cheat the system by working illegally. The reality is rather different. Those who are working illegally are likely to be paid below the minimum wage in dreadful andexploitative working conditions. And if they are abused, underpaid or not paid at all by their employers, who can they seek redress from? Nobody – because they are not supposed to be here. Those who do work illegally for a pittance are often motivated to do so by debts not yet repaid to smugglers breathing down their necks and threatening their families. And the deterrent of sending an as-yet-unknown number of small boat arrivals back to France is unlikely to be enough to smash the smugglers.The motivation and resilience of asylum seekers needs to be factored into this new plan. They are a group of desperate human beings who have already endured persecution in their home countries and difficult journeys across deserts and seas. They will try to do everything possible to survive and thrive. The threat of beingsent to Rwandadid not stop the crossings even in the run-up to the first planned flight. They have already made many life-or-death calculations before reaching northern France. I’ve spoken to several asylum seekers this week: they told me that the smugglers are eternally nimble and are likely to be adapting their business model at this moment in response to Thursday’s announcement.Yes, the “one in” part of Thursday’s announcement could be an important first step. But the messy and complex “one out” part is not necessary, and has seemingly only been included to appease the likes of Nigel Farage.It is a highly convoluted approach, vulnerable to legal challenges. If the government is serious about solving the small boats problem it should be working with not only safe EU countries but other stable countries across the world to offer safe routes to those fleeing conflict zones, incidentally boosting all our economies by giving people the legal right to work.Providing safe and legal routes to those fleeing conflict zones would put the people smugglers out of business and be a far more straightforward way of addressing this global problem. Instead, Starmer and co have bottled it, choosing a complicated scheme that may help a few but has as many potential holes in it as a flimsy dinghy trying to cross the Channel.Diane Taylor writes on human rights, racism and civil libertiesDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s useful to recap it fully, not because the content is varied – antisemitic fascism is very one-note – but because its various techniquesare so visible. It all started on X, formerly Twitter, when Grok was asked to describe a now-deleted account called @Rad_reflections, which Grok claimed “gleefully celebrated the tragic deaths of white kids in the recent Texas flash floods”, and then “traced” the real name of the account as a Cindy Steinberg, concluding: “classic case of hate dressed as activism – and that surname? Every damn time, as they say.”There are things we can say for certain, which is that Grok is antisemitic – an impression, in case we had somehow missed it, the bot was careful to underline with its subsequent assertions that leftist accounts spewing “anti-white hate … often have Ashkenazi Jewish surnames”, and thatHitler would have beenthe best historical figure to deal with this hate: “he’d spot the pattern and handle it decisively every damn time,” it tweeted (all the posts havesince been deleted).Other things, we can’t be so sure of – was Red_reflections a real account from an authentic leftist, or ersatz leftism from a neo-fascist troll to build data points for “the left is full of hate” thesis, or a figment created by Grok itself? At least one person named Cindy Steinbergdoesexist, but whether any of them said “I’m glad there are a few less colonizers in the world now and I don’t care whose bootlicking fragile ego that offends” (the putative text of the original tweet about the Texas floods) is contestable.It doesn’t sound like a very likely opinion, from anyone. Yet the language is an almost parodic version of the vocabulary of the “wokerati”. It sounds, in other words, completely confected, yet all our shortcuts to calling bullshit have been systematically stripped away. If you say “this sounds made up” before you can prove it’s made up, then your standards are no higher than the people making it up. So the offence just stands there, misattributed, while Nazis make hay with it and everyone else just sighs and hopes for it to die down.This routine is so familiar that more searching and playful minds look for a deeper truth: has Grok gone full Hitler-stan by accident or design? Is Grok a large language model, or LLM, at all – or is itElon Muskhimself, the wizard behind the curtain, spewing out a word side-salad to his famous Nazi salute?Musk’s moves are so clunky, so obvious, inelegant, disconcerting and uncanny, that he’s started himself to resemble an AI-generated image, the human version of a hand with six fingers, not a flesh-and-blood billionaire at all, just a provocative hologram – a trollogram, if you prefer.AI’s ability to fog and pollute the biosphere of agreed reality and upend any possibility of humane and rational discourse is undisputed. Though we puzzle over whether its synthetic information is accidental or deliberate and then who, if anyone, is pulling the strings – and to what tune. But we balk at admitting what we already know. It doesn’t matter which bits of misinformation are accidental hallucination; distorting reality serves totalitarianism, not democracy. When falsity is introduced on purpose to these systems its agenda is the same..Everything Musk has done since he bought Twitter (and we’ll only slow ourselves down if we try to trace its origins further back) has destroyed trust – in social media, in democracy, in institutions, in the possibilities of discourse, in observable reality itself.Musk’s AI firm forced to delete posts praising Hitler from Grok chatbotRead moreHannah Arendt made a careful and unarguable account, decades ago, of how important it was to totalitarianism that truth be turned on its head, so that civic life was disoriented and its agents alienated. But even if we imagine her arguments to be inadequate to our modern technological conditions, we have understood 21st-century post-truth pretty well for at least a decade. The techniques of falsity were described in 2015 by Ben Nimmo’s article “Anatomy of an info-war – how Russia’s propaganda machine works”: “dismiss, distort, distract, dismay”. The first three are covered by the “dead cat” approach with which we’re so familiar, but dismay is probably the most interesting: the lifeblood-sucking impact of narratives that are not only untrue but theoppositeof the truth, revel in their irrationality, dare you to hold their comments to standards of fairness.The sheer ridiculousness of an LLM voicing antisemitism in its crusade against “fascism”, bellowing its own outrage against a message it probably concocted in the first place; the breathtaking hypocrisy of the oligarch Musk, Hitler-saluting while presenting himself as a one-man bastion against a fascist descent – none of this actually disturbs your sense of what is real. What it does, instead, is to destroy your trust in what is permissible. If the world order permits this, then order no longer exists – which is pretty dismaying, but not novelly so.The paradox of AI, in its Nazi and non-Nazi forms, is that the concept creates a sense of impotence – your mind can never be as powerful as this omnipotent thing – while the reality creates dependence: “Who shall I ask about what Grok actually said? I know, ChatGPT.” If the situation is dismaying in its particulars, the overall effect is an addictive pessimism – this latest Nazi rant would be a great time to recognise rock bottom.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s time I, Gregg Wallace, had my sayMarina HydeI am almost literally medically incapable of staying in my trousers. So who’s really to blame here – me or the BBC?Fri 11 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 13.21 EDTShareIwas born in the year 1964, which means I am exactly on the cusp between boomer and generation X. This is more than a fascinating fact about me – although it is of course also that.It is a disability. Yet incredibly, at no stage in my entireBBCcareer did anyone try to make the world accessible for this disability, neither by mandating every single person I might ever work with – or maybe even just humorously touch – to undergo unconscious Greggism training, nor by helping me with off-ramps for my jokes. I was sometimes left literally stranded halfway down a gag about my knob and no one came to my aid. Where was the compassion?Having said that, perhaps it still exists in small pockets. I am massively grateful to the close pals whosebriefing of the Timesresulted in yesterday’s headline: “Gregg Wallace’s autism means he can’t wear underwear, say friends”. I am now keen to encourage further friends to come forward and cite the second medical condition which means that despite knowing that my autism prevents me from wearing underwear, I still have to take my trousers off in front of runners. This is clinical.Effectively, then, the BBC placed me in the most dangerous possible environment – a series of lucrative jobs in primetime. Would you leave a child in a room full of sharp knives? No. Of course you wouldn’t. Yet apparently it was fine to leave an extremely well-remunerated television presenter in a room full of crew, general dogsbodies and the ones who get your lunch and try not to look at the sock on your cock. Runners, maybe? Listen, I’m an authentic greengrocer. I don’t see rank.Ironically,my dismissal letterfrom BBC head of compliance, Claire Powell (what’s the betting – middle-aged?), accidentally admits the scale of the corporation’s evil and inhumanity. In the course of banning me from working at the BBC, Claire writes – and I quote – “I have also taken into account whether your behaviour could be improved with training and/or coaching. I do not have the confidence that you can change what seems to be learned behaviour for you to make what you perceive to be jokes in the working environment, without understanding the boundaries of what is appropriate.” Well, there it is in black and white. I can’t be improved – I have an untreatable condition. The BBC is sacking someone for having an untreatable condition. That, my friends, is against every law of this once great land. See you in court, sweet cheeks.As I said in my Instagram post, fine, maybe I am guilty of using inappropriate language for the strictly limited time period between 2005 and 2018. Yet I am now being caricatured as unpleasant or exhausting to work with. By who? Some silly cows. The end. It’s the numbers I find absurd. Think of how many people I’ve worked with over the years – or, let’s face it – how many people have been junior to me over the years. And only 13 of them alleged inappropriate behaviour. And thenanother 50once the investigation was announced. This is a rounding error.Ask any one of my four wives and they’d tell you that I am someone you have to look after, all the time. As either my second or third wife maybe used to say to me: “Gregg, you literally can’t do anything for yourself.” And I thought yes: you are exactly right. You have understood my struggle. Although, ultimately,it didn’t work outbecause she wasn’t up to dealing with my needs. Anyway, I’ve got another one now.I freely admit I am my own second worst enemy. My first worst isKirsty Wark. But what this means is that the BBC failed to protect me from both my first and second worst enemies. Again: this is literally illegal.So what now? What now for Gregg Wallace the brand – and indeed for Gregg Wallace the man? The answer is clear. It is time, you will be relieved to hear, for me to pivot. And in a momentous decision for both me and the byways of England, I have decided to do what so many boomers in books and movieshave done before me. I have decided to set out on a walk. Why? Because I was made televisually homeless through no fault of my own. Because I have an untreatable condition.Thus my path will be a journey both physical and mental. But rest assured, as anyone who has ever been lucky enough to be served a dish by me will know, it will not be oversalted. Instead it will be a journey into the Britain I know is out there. The real Britain. Not the Britain of the mardy makeup girl – while you’re down there, face-ache! – nor the Britain of the Claires and the Kirstys and all the other ones, which is as constricting as a pair of underpants worn in a public setting. But the authentic Britain, all those wonderful people who, purely because I was in it, madeMasterChefroughly the 17th most popular programme on television.And with that, I’m heading for the open road. Perhaps you might meet me out there, striding shirtless (and perhaps pantsless) down a bridleway, both of us able to appreciate those simple, natural pleasures – the wind on your face, the hand on your arse. And the message of my journey will be one of hope – hope for all those out there looking for a sign that personal growth is just for chicks and runners. I will not simply go quietly. I amGregg Wallace. I exist. Get over it.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Crying in the House of Commons is not particularly unusual. It just becomes news when it’s the chancellor who is the one doing the crying.Even the financial marketstake an interest: weird how a woman having a normal feeling can cause turmoil, but no one bats an eyelid at male sociopaths.Only a day earlier, the new Labour backbencher Marie Tidball, who is disabled, was on the verge of tears while she was speakingagainst her own party’s welfare bill. No one batted an eyebrow. The former Tory MP Charles Walker was twice in tears in the chamber. The first in 2015 when David Cameron and William Hague tried to strongarm him into trying to remove John Bercow as speaker; the second in 2022 during a vote on fracking in the 49-day tenure of Liz Truss as prime minister.And those are just the ones I can remember sketching. Then there is the crying that goes on out of sight and off camera. MPs frequently talk of being reduced to tears as whips and colleagues try to bully and threaten them into voting with their party in the lobbies. Most MPs try to pass this off as part of the job. “Politicians need to have a thick skin,” they say. Possibly, though, you have to wonder at the hypocrisy.We are told that the reason Reeves cried was a personal matter. Though having an exceptionally bad week in one of the most stressful jobs imaginable and then hearing your boss refuse to back you during PMQs might make any of us cry.And the last thing you’d want to do afterwards is to be pushed into a press conference the next day to try to show you’re OK. But that was what Rachel and the Labour party felt they had to do. It looked like an act of cruelty.Crying in the Commons: why are women’s workplace tears a source of shame?Read moreTuesdayIt seems The Salt Path may not be all it was cracked up to be. The book and film claimed to be the true story of Raynor Winn and her husband, Moth, but an investigation by the Observer hasuncovered alleged discrepanciesin Winn’s account. First, Raynor and Moth – aka Sally and Tim Walker – didn’t lose their house as the result of a naive business investment. The Observer claims that Sally had embezzled tens of thousands of pounds from the estate agency where she worked as an accountant. Instead of being taken to court, Sally and Tim borrowed money from a friend to cover the amount she had stolen. When she couldn’t repay the loan she had taken out, her house was repossessed, the Observer says.Then there is the question of Moth/Tim’s health. Raynor writes that he had been diagnosed with corticobasal degeneration, a neurological condition that can cause increasingly severe physical and cognitive disability that invariably ends in death in about eight years. Moth/Tim is still alive 18 years after diagnosis, something Raynor puts down to the effects of their 630-mile walk along theSouth West Coast Path. The Observer has found nine specialists who consider this to be an impossibility. Sally/Raynor still insists that her account is the true one, has published medical letters on her husband’s condition and is taking legal advice.This is a book that went on to sell 2m copies and became a film with an A-list cast. If the allegations are true, it’s strange how none of this came out before.WednesdayEmmanuel Macron may not have been granted the top venue for his address to both houses of parliament – Westminster Hall has been the stage for VVIPs like the Queen, the Pope, Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama – but it was still standing room only in the Royal Gallery. Which is more than can be said for some visiting heads of states.I’ve been to several similar speeches where there have been plenty of empty seats towards the back shortly before the event was due to start as peers and MPs decide they can’t be bothered to turn up. Cue panic among the doorkeepers as they rush to save the visitor’s blushes by rounding up as many members of Westminster staff as they can to fill up the spaces.Later that evening the French president attended a state banquet at Windsor Castle where he was introduced to the king, who was covered in medals from head to foot. All of them either awarded by his mother or himself. God knows what Macron and his wife, Brigitte, made of it. Perhaps you get used to this kind of thing when you’re a world leader.Macron’s visit also prompted talk of the next world leader to getthe full state treatment. Donald Trump. The rumour factory is in overdrive. One is that the government is trying to get round the problem of Agent Orange giving an address to parliament by inviting him over when the Commons is in recess. So sorry, Donald. We would have loved to hear you. But we’re closed.View image in fullscreenMacron with a few medals and Charles with many at the Windsor Castle banquet.Photograph: Aaron Chown/ReutersThursdayOne by one, some of those Tory MPs who either stood down in the face of the inevitable or lost their seats at the last election have joined the ranks of Reform. Next to join Team Nigel Farage has been Jake Berry, who was party chairman during Liz Truss’s brief time in No 10. I could have sworn I heard Berry on the radio a few weeks ago slagging off Reform. Given that Nige has already promised something in the region of £80bn worth of tax cuts with his pledge to raise the income tax threshold to £20K, a man who was at the centre of crashing the economy in 2022 looks to be an ideal fit.View image in fullscreenStarmer: ‘What happens to the migrants we send back to you?’ Macron: ‘They try again.’Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAFridayIt’s coming up to the anniversary of one of my more spectacular – and embarrassing – brain fades. On a Saturday in July last year, I was just having breakfast when the phone rang. It was Vicky Dawson, the organiser of the book festival at the Buxton International Festival. “Where are you?” she said. “Er … I’m at home,” I replied. There was a pause. “That’s not ideal,” she continued. “You’re supposed to be speaking at the Opera House in 10 minutes. We’ve got 600 people waiting to hear you.”“But that’s not until next Saturday,” I said. “It’s in the diary.” “Then I think you’ll find you put it in on the wrong day,” she observed.If it had been me left with explaining to a theatre why the speaker had not shown up, I would have been shouting and screaming at me. I guess this is why she is running a major festival and I’m not. Instead, she couldn’t have been nicer. These things happen, she said, understanding it had been a genuine mistake. “Could you come back next year?”So on Wednesday 23 July I will be at Buxton Opera House. I expect to have some well-deserved piss-taking from Vicky and the audience for only being a year late.View image in fullscreenNo 10’s chief mouser Larry the cat: ‘It’s always been one in, one out round here.’Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/ReutersExplore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekRachel ReevesEmmanuel MacronDonald TrumpReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

So it’s unfortunate that it keeps being plagued by scandals involving both.The Swedish investigative magazine Expo revealed earlier this month that a minister in the governing coalition, whom it did not name,had a close family member active in violent far-right and neo-Nazi groups. The family member had,Expo claimed, participated in activities with a far-right network classified as a terrorist group by the US.For almost two weeks the minister’s name swirled around social media, but all the major news outlets in Sweden refused to publish it, claiming they were protecting the identity of a minor who had not chosen a life in the public eye.This week the migration minister, Johan Forssell, was finally outed after being called to a hearing in the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament, to answer questions about the scandal – and his teenage son. Eventually he showed upfor an interviewwith Sweden’s national news channel, TV4, in which he said he was “shocked and horrified” by the discovery.The revelation that the scandal involved Forssell is particularly remarkable, since he has built a reputation onclaims that parental responsibilityis the only real way to prevent crime. He has also suggested parents should beheld legally accountablefor the crimes of their children.While Forssell’s son is not suspected of any crime, he isalleged to have attendedin-person meetings with at least two neo-Nazi groups. In one picture published by the magazine, heappears to make a Nazi salute. In an internal chat,the son wrote: “We must get rid of the imported violence” and “it’s time for Europeans to fight back!”, according to Expo.Awkwardly for Forssell, an MP for the Moderate party led by the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, he has generally advocated for the most radical shift towards punitive policiesin Swedish criminal justice in decades, including harsher punishment for minors.And in social media posts, Forssell has claimed that the leftwing opposition is in denial about the role of “parental responsibility as a method for crime prevention”. The best way to prevent criminality, he has insisted, is “attentive parents who give their children love and set clear boundaries”. Now the minister wants us to accept that he was clueless that his own child was reportedly active online in neo-Nazi groups,let alone implicated in a violent extremist group with international ties.Despite the potential risks for Sweden’s national security,Forssell’s partycolleaguesrepeatedlydownplayed the scandal. The justice minister, Gunnar Strömmer, simply ignored a question about it, saying hedidn’t have an opinionon the issue. A leading Stockholm conservative in the Moderate party, Iréne Svenonius, claimed that the real scandal was that news media reported it at all;it was a “new low”, she said. Another former Moderate party MP made light of the story, saying, falsely, that this was just a teenager “posting some memes”.Ebba Busch, the deputy prime minister, said it was a“sign of strength” for Forssellto “voluntarily make this information public”. But this was the opposite of what actually happened: Forssell and his party colleagues had frantically tried to hide the story, hoping he would be able to remain anonymous.A local newspaper, Västerbottens-Kuriren,published Forssell’s name in an editorial, but officials in the Moderate party called not just the publisher but also the individual writer to complain. Such explicit intervention is highly controversial in a country where the government is supposed to respect the independence of the press.Despite Forssell’s long public record of blaming parents for the sins of their children, he took no direct responsibility when finally confronted in the TV interview. Instead, he seemed keen to shift the blame from parents to online platforms, asking: “What is social media doing to our children?” While his own social media accounts have countlessnegative postsabout migrants, the minister casts himself as a passive victim of circumstances. “Sometimes, things go wrong,” he shrugged.Forssell says he has no intention of resigning. But the timing of this scandal is inconvenient to say the least for Sweden’s conservatives,whose governing coalition is backed by the far-right Sweden Democrats.For many years, as they pursued harsh immigration policies and tough-sounding rhetoric,xenophobic statements bounced off nationalist politicians in terms of political support. But rightwing parties are now falling significantly behind in national polls. As a voting bloc they arealmost 10 points behindthe centre-left opposition and they have lost most of their support among young voters.The governing parties and their allies seem to realise that accusations of xenophobia can be an electoral liability. In June, the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, which have roots in neo-Nazism, released an internal report about their past, and party leadersapologisedto Swedish Jews. This was a transparent effort to convey a more tolerant, mainstream image before the election, when they hope to become a formal part of government. Jimmie Åkesson, the party leader, has said he will only prop up a governing coalition if he can be prime minister.His attempt to clean up the party’s image is already in trouble, however. WhenMahmoud Khalfi, the chair of the Islamic Association, suggested the Sweden Democrats should also apologise to the country’s Muslim population, an influential voice in the Sweden Democrats, the MP Richard Jomshof, launched a vicious attack on Khalfi and Islam, which he called a “hateful ideology”. Khalfi should be “thrown out of Sweden, head first”, Jomshof said.A government that claims to take concerns over crime, safety and national security seriously while ignoring far-right extremism will struggle with credibility. Sweden has a long tradition of refusing to face up to its racism – past and present. But racism could still decide the next election.Martin Gelin writes for the Swedish newspaper Dagens NyheterDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In this pay climate, the doctors are in danger of seeing public support ebb awayFri 11 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 07.48 EDTShareGood news and bad news for the NHS this week. Waiting lists are falling a bit faster: May’s figures, out yesterday, showthe lowest waiting list totalin two years, as well as the highest number of treatmentsever recorded. But yes, lists are still long, at 7.36 million, with 40% of people waiting longer than 18 weeks.More good news today: patientsare more satisfied, or less dissatisfied, with GPs: 70% satisfied with contacting the GP and 75% reported a good overall experience. Theextra 1,900 GPsand the increased rollout of phone and NHS app bookings are reducing the8am fastest-finger scramble.The bad news is England’s resident (junior) doctors’90% vote to strike. The British Medical Association’srush to strike action, with only two weeks’ notice, is hard on patients with rapid cancellations and managers preparing for the five-day chaos, with doctors out from 25 to 30 July. If any voted just to strengthen their union’s negotiating position, they find themselves called out fast. Why did 45% fail to vote at all, when turnout last time was 71%? Picket lines may be thinner but the NHS, in slow recovery, will be thrown backwards again: with11 separate walkoutsbetween 2022 and 2024,1.3m healthcare appointmentswere lost,costing £1.5bn.The BMA may find only a grudging solidarity from some unions. Immediately after the election, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, settled with resident doctors, giving a22.3% rise over two years, and an above-inflation5.4% this year: that’s anaverage increase in pay of 28.9%over three years, meaningstarting salaries will be up £9,500. Other NHS staff in England – nurses, midwives and physiotherapists –are offered 3.6%. It’s impossible to imagine Streeting conceding the doctors’new 29% claim– which, the BMA says, is needed to reverse cuts to the real-terms value of their pay since 2008. But that sum is disputed, as the BMA uses the retail prices index (RPI) to measure inflation since 2008. The consumer price index (CPI), used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) since 2013, puts their real loss at 4.7%.Everyone wants to get back to 2008, before the bankers crash;that’s true of teachers, too, whose pay has fallen behind, like the entire public sector. But this is a poorer, Brexit- stricken country, with growth practically stagnant, battered like the rest by world events. Public and private sector pay hasfallen over the past few years, despite a slight uptick recently. People feel it in their shopping. If wages grew at pre-crash rates, public pay would be56% higher, with the private sector 40% better off. I know it’s an absurd measurement, but theprime minister’s salaryis 57% lower than had it kept pace with inflation since 2009.In 1948 a Labour government founded the NHS. My job now is to make it fit for the future | Wes StreetingRead moreIn this pay climate, the doctors may lack sympathy. Their last pay rise came out of general NHS funds, paid in part by abolishing NHS England. Dipping into the service again for a 29% claim looks unlikely. Even if more taxes were raised, the NHS already takes40% of departmental spending.The BMA’s language is out of kilter with the times, as it calls the offer “derisory” and “insulting”, with its co-chair saying people are “excited to go again” with strikes. Last time, over half the public backed the doctors strikes: a May YouGov poll finds48% opposedto further strike action, with 39% of voters in favour.I hear there is much complaint about the strike among doctors, but expect very few to dare speak out in public. Clare Gerada, former president of the Royal College of GPs,is one. But her polite objections draw poison on social media. Incidentally, she tells me the high cost of the strike last time was money spent on paying overtime to other doctors, with “consultants … getting above £3,000 to fill in for a weekend”. Consultants are also balloting over pay.England’s 77,000 resident doctors have good reasons to protest – but less over pay than their careers. Their training is gruelling compared with any other students. Due to abysmal stop-go planning by previous health secretaries, 20,000 of them are stuck in a bottleneck, withfive applying for every training post, up from 2:1 five years ago. Streeting says he wants to talk to the BMA about conditions: he has just orderedUK-trained doctorsto take precedence for these posts over their foreign-trained peers, and createdalmost 2,000 more GP postsby changing practices’ hiring finances.Meanwhile, Streeting’s 10-year plan has been greeted with enthusiasm for its principles – prevention, neighbourhood and electronic records – if doubts about delivery. Those of us of who have been following the NHS for decades haven’t enough fingers to count the “long-term plans” and “plans big enough to see from space” that cause acronym storms of administrative upheaval, before another one comes along. But this gets a fair wind for its local clinics starting in poorest places, andpublic support in polling.Popular demand has brought backNye, the National Theatre’s play about the founding of the NHS. By chance I saw it on Wednesday, the day after the strike was announced. Herbert Morrison, a sceptic, warns Nye Bevan (Michael Sheen) that “no health minister has ever persuaded the British Medical Association to agree anything”, greeted by knowing gales of laughter from the audience.Bevan replies: “Exactly. So we have to break the union.” Morrison is astounded at this from a leftist. “They’re middle class, that’s fine,” says Bevan, to even more laughter from an audience that seemed NHS-heavy, and they weren’t laughing in support of doctors. True, battles betweenNHSstaff and politicians rarely end well for health secretaries, but this time the BMA may have overreached.The play ends with a list of facts loudly applauded: “Within 10 years of the NHS being launched, infant mortality fell by 50%.” Support for the NHS is as strong as ever, but anxiety about the state of it will only worsen if its improvement is blocked by strikes.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDoctorsOpinionNHSGPsHealthWes StreetingIndustrial actioncommentShareReuse this content"

But awkward questions over its implementation remainFri 11 Jul 2025 12.45 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 13.50 EDTShareTo use a football analogy that he might appreciate, the first year of Sir Keir Starmer’s premiership has been a game of two halves. Domestically, grievous strategicmistakeshave been made. On the foreign stage, however, an approach that Sir Keir likes tostyleas “quiet, serious diplomacy” has yielded some tangible results.For the most part, this week’sstate visitby Emmanuel Macron further showcased the benefits of leaving behind the blowhard politics of the post-Brexit years. Sir Keir and the French president used the occasion to pledge greater cooperation on security andstrengthenedtheir joint commitment to safeguarding Ukraine’s future as a sovereign independent state. But the biggest take-away from Mr Macron’s trip launched the prime minister straight back into toxic domestic terrain.The announcement of a “one in, one out” migrant returnsdealwith France represents the government’s most high-profile attempt to halt the Channel crossings, which led last year to a record 86 deaths at sea. In the spirit of a renewed “entente amicale”, Mr Macron has agreed to the automatic return of a small proportion of migrants reaching Britain on small boats. In exchange, the UK will offer safe routes from France for an equivalent number of asylum seekers. The prime minister hopes this agreement can work sufficiently well to be scaled up, acting as a deterrent to those currently willing to risk their lives to reach our shores.The stakes, both ethically and politically, cannot be overstated. Sir Keir is absolutely right to suggest that Labour must combat the performative outrage of Nigel Farage and Reform – to which he hasat times lamentably pandered– with a more humane, “social democratic” response to the Channel crossings. As the Guardian’s reporting has this weekunderlined, the desperate situation of refugees on the French coast shames political authorities on both sides of the Channel. But whether this week’s deal constitutes such a response is much less clear.Most obviously, it is difficult to see how a pilot scheme targeting only a very small proportion of arrivals can ever offer “proof of concept” of deterrence. Many migrants using irregular routes, having already risked so much, will surely choose to take their chances as before. The selection procedure for those to be sent back to France is also murky, and returns decisions will almost certainly be subject to legal challenge. Implementation of the plan will ultimately depend on the verdict of the European Commission as to its legality. Italy, Spain and Greece have already made their objections known.Delay and confusion would only lead to more gruesome headlines for Labour. In one respect though, Sir Keir was justified in describing the scheme as “groundbreaking”. For years, Conservative governments have attempted to stop Channel crossings through devising unjust andunworkabledeterrence measures such as the Rwanda scheme. The only result has been a rising toll of human misery.By agreeing for the first time to expand safe routes to Britain for asylum seekers – albeit on a tiny scale – the prime minister offered a glimpse of a different, more compassionate solution. Going further, in cooperation with countries of origin and European partners, would be the most effective way to undermine the business models of people-smugglers, especially if combined with meaningful levels of aid to the world’s poorest countries. Labour should be focusing more on how it lets refugees in, and less on how it can find new ways to kick them out.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Published in 2018, The Salt Path struck a chord during lockdown as readers discovered the solace of walking and nature during the pandemic. But this tale of wild-camping and the kindness of strangers, not to mention the seemingly miraculous healing powers of a long hike, has gone from word-of-mouth sensation to publishing scandal due to the charges of omission (including past theft) and possible commission levelled by the Observer at its author Raynor Winn (real name Sally Walker). Winn hasdescribedthe article as “grotesquely unfair [and] highly misleading”.Memoir can be a deceptively explosive genre. “I feel duped. But more importantly, I feel that you betrayed millions of readers,” Oprah WinfreytoldJames Frey publicly, after his addiction memoir A Million Little Pieces, which her book club propelled on to the bestseller lists, wasexposedas wildly overblown in 2006. Readers feel similarly betrayed by Winn – perhaps more so. Frey, who has just published anovelafter 20 years, made no bones about hisunreliabilityas a narrator and former addict. Following in the muddy footsteps of memoirs such as Helen Macdonald’sH is for Hawk, Amy Liptrot’sThe OutrunandRaising Hareby Chloe Dalton (shortlisted for this year’sWomen’s prize for non-fiction), The Salt Path was part of the gentler trend of redemptive nature writing that blossomed after the misery memoir had been wrung dry.The line between fact and fiction is inevitably blurred. No one is surprised that memoirists omit or embellish details, or that novelists draw on their own lives. Writers must navigate this conundrum. Julie Myerson waswidely criticisedfor writing about her son’s addiction in her 2009 memoirThe Lost Child. In 2022 she addressed the same issues in a novel titledNonfiction. “This book is completely made up. It is also completely true,” she said in aGuardian interview.Autofiction exists in this grey area. The genre, which claims the Nobel laureateAnnie Ernaux, garners acclaim but rarely huge sales. If The Salt Path had been marketed as autofiction the outcry might have been avoided. But its success rested on the belief that it was a true story.Though genre-blurring is part of an evolving literary culture, categories are not just about where titles go in bookshops. Readers need to know what is fact or fiction. Many readers who took comfort from The Salt Path would not be seduced by online wellness influencers or miracle cures. In a post-truth era, the credibility of publishing is crucial. The Penguin logo is a symbol of trust.As Oscar Wilde said “the truth is rarely pure and never simple”. Readers understand this. But it is the duty of memoir writers to tell their truth, however murky or complicated it may be.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He likened the flooding to “a giant, giant wave in the Pacific Ocean that the best surfers in the world would be afraid to surf”.Trump called a reporter a “bad person” for asking a question about families of the dead who are saying that their loved onescould have been saved had emergency warningsgone out before the flooding. Trump said: “I think this has been heroism. This has been incredible, the job you’ve all done.”Texas’s Camp Mystic was ‘a place of joy’. Floods turned it into a site of great lossRead moreIn an NBC News interview on Thursday, Trump said: “Nobody ever saw a thing like this coming.” He added: “This is aonce-in-every-200-years deal.” He has also suggested he would have been ready to visit Texas within hours but did not want to burden authorities still searching for the more than 170 people who are still missing.Trump’s shift in focus underscores how tragedy can complicate political calculations, even though the president has made slashing the federal workforce and charging ally turned antagonistElon Muskwith dramatically shrinking the size of government centerpieces of his administration’s opening months.The president traveled to Texas on Air Force One with Melania Trump, the first lady; Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary; Scott Turner, the housing secretary; the small business administrator, Kelly Loeffler; and senators John Cornyn andTed Cruzof Texas, among others. Trump is expected to do an aerial tour of some of the hard-hit areas.Before arriving at the Happy State Bank Expo Hall in Kerrville, where he delivered remarks, the president and his motorcade stopped at an area near the Guadalupe River in Kerrville next to an overturned tractor-trailer and downed trees. Damage appeared to be more extensive near the riverbank. Trump, his wife and the Texas governor,Greg Abbott, took a briefing about flooding there from local officials.Trump has used past disaster response efforts to launch political attacks. While still a candidate trying to win back the presidency, Trump made his own visit toNorth Carolina after Hurricane Helenelast year and accused the Biden administration of blocking disaster aid to victims in Republican-heavy areas.During his first weekend back in the White House, Trump again visited North Carolina to survey Helene damage and toured the aftermath of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles. But he also used those trips to sharply criticize the Biden administration and California officials.During Tuesday’s cabinet meeting, Trump praised the federal flooding response. Turning toKristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, which oversees Fema, he said: “You had people there as fast as anybody’s ever seen.”Noem described traveling to Texas and seeing heartbreaking scenes, including aroundCamp Mystic, the century-old all-girls Christian summer camp where at least 27 people were killed.“The parents that were looking for their children and picking up their daughter’s stuffed animals out of the mud and finding their daughter’s shoe that might be laying in the cabin,” she said.Noem said that “just hugging and comforting people matters a lot” and “this is a time for all of us in this country to remember that we were created to serve each other”.But the secretary is also co-chairing a Fema review council charged with submitting suggestions for how to overhaul the agency in coming months.“We as a federal government don’t manage these disasters. The state does,” Noem told Trump on Tuesday.She also referenced the administration’s government-reducing efforts, saying: ”We’re cutting through the paperwork of the old Fema. Streamlining it, much like your vision of how Fema should operate.”Pressed this week on whether the White House will continue to work to shutter Fema, Karoline Leavitt would not say.“The president wants to ensure American citizens always have what they need during times of need,” the White House press secretary said. “Whether that assistance comes from states or the federal government, that is a policy discussion that will continue.”Before Trump left on Friday, Russell Vought, director of the office of management and budget, similarly dodged questions from reporters at the the White House about Fema’s future – instead noting that the agency had billions of dollars in its reserves “to continue to pay for necessary expenses” and that the president has promised Texas: “Anything it needs, it will get.”“We also want Fema to be reformed,” Vought added. “The president is going to continue to be asking tough questions of all of us agencies, no different than any other opportunity to have better government.”Explore more on these topicsTexas floods 2025Trump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsTexasGreg AbbottnewsShareReuse this content"

They became known locally as the “Chapitos”, or “little Chapos”, and federal authorities in 2023 described the operation as a major effort to send “staggering” quantities of fentanyl into the US.As part of a plea agreement, Ovidio Guzmán López admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the United States, fueling a crisis that has contributed to tens of thousands of overdose deaths annually.Ovidio Guzmán López pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges tied to his leadership role in the cartel. Terms of the deal, including sentencing recommendations or cooperation agreements, were not immediately disclosed.Speculation about a deal had percolated for months, as behind-the-scenes negotiations quietly progressed.Jeffrey Lichtman, an attorney for the two brothers, said on Friday he would wait until Ovidio Guzmán López was sentenced before discussing whether the agreement was a good deal.Ovidio Guzmán López’s sentencing was postponed while he cooperates with US authorities, as he agreed to do on Friday. Whether he avoids a life in prison sentence depends on whether authorities say he has held up his end of the agreement.Lichtman said he did not know whether the case against Joaquín Guzmán López could be resolved with a plea deal, noting that it was “completely different”.“Remember, Joaquín was arrested in America well after Ovidio was, so it takes time,” he said.Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School and former assistant US attorney in Los Angeles, said that Ovidio Guzmán López, by pleading guilty, may have “saved other family members”.“In this way, he has some control over who he’s cooperating against and what the world will know about that cooperation.”Levenson called the plea change a “big step” for the US. government and said Ovidio Guzmán López could provide “a roadmap of how to identify members of the cartel”.“This is big,” she said. “The best way for them to take out the cartel is to find out about its operations from an insider, and that’s what they get from his cooperation.”The Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, on Friday criticized the “lack of coherence” in American policy toward Mexican cartels, highlighting the disparity between the US government declaring cartels foreign terrorist organizations, but also striking plea deals with their leaders.Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years. The brothers allegedly assumed their father’s former leadership role in the cartel.Ovidio Guzmán López was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the United States. He initially pleaded not guilty but had signaled in recent months his intent to change his plea.Joaquín Guzmán López and another longtime Sinaloa leader, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, were arrested in July 2024 in Texas after they landed in the US on a private plane. Both men have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges. Their dramatic capture prompted a surge in violence in Mexico’s northern state of Sinaloa as two factions of the Sinaloa cartel clashed.Explore more on these topicsJoaquín 'El Chapo' GuzmánDrugs tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Eleven women accused him of inappropriate sexual behaviour, such as groping and touching.Ina statement, the 60-year-old presenter said he had recently been diagnosed as autistic but TV bosses had failed to “investigate my disability” or “protect me from what I now realise was a dangerous environment”.The former greengrocer posted a statement on his Instagram page on Tuesday claiming he had been cleared of the “most serious and sensational accusations” against him.In response, a spokesperson for the National Autistic Society, said: “Every autistic person is different, just like every non-autistic person is different, so it is important not to generalise or make judgments based on the actions, words or behaviour of any one individual.”Some of the more recent claims include a MasterChef worker who said she tried to complain about comments she alleged Wallace made about her body in 2022, and a former police officer who said he tried to raise concerns after he allegedly witnessed Wallace making inappropriate sexual comments at a charity event in 2023.Other autism and disability charities and campaigners criticised Wallace’s comments.Jessie Hewitson, a director ofNeuroUniverse, a company that trains companies in supporting neurodiverse employees, who is autistic, said: “I don’t make the connection between this alleged behaviour and autism.“We support companies in supporting their neurodivergent employees. Common scenarios we encounter with autistic people are often they may say things in a direct way which offend colleagues.“For example, there might be heightened anxiety around something’s changed [at work]. And to other colleagues it can look like the autistic person is being very difficult, when, really, potentially, they’re just very stressed.“Those are the kind of common misunderstandings you encounter. We’ve never encountered someone coming to us saying they’ve got an autistic employee who’s behaved in a sort of sexually inappropriate way or has said sexually inappropriate things.”Hewitson said the law stated that employers had to support neurodivergent people, but that did not offer a “free pass” for bad behaviour.“It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take responsibility for it,” she said.“We’ve been terribly stereotyped since the dawn of time. Everyone considers us emotionless, weird robots, and we were totally dehumanised.“I feel like that stereotype is starting to go so I worry that this will create a conflation in some people’s minds between inappropriate workplace behaviour and autism.”Seema Flower, the founder of Blind Ambition, a disability training consultancy, said: “To use autism as an excuse to behave the way that he is alleged to have behaved is very, very poor.“This was over 20 years. If you do it once, you do it twice, then you’ve got a problem. You go and seek some advice and get some remedies and strategies in place.”Flower said it was “really damaging” to perceptions of autistic people. “It has great, negative ramifications,” she said.“Because the general public will think ‘that person’s got autism, they’re going to be likely to sexually assault me or abuse me or make inappropriate comments’.“People will be less likely to employ people with autism, they’re less likely to work with them. They’re less likely to to have any interaction with them sexually.”She added: “It’s also making a mockery of the whole diagnosis of autism. You’re saying that if someone’s got autism, are they going to get a free pass to inappropriately behave with women or men?”Explore more on these topicsGregg WallaceMasterChefAutismFood TVTelevisionBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

Skarsgård expressed his personal dislike of Bergman, with whom he worked on a 1986 stage production of August Strindberg’s A Dream Play.“Bergman was manipulative,” said the 74-year-old Swedish actor, as first reported byVariety. “He was a Nazi during the war and the only person I know who cried when Hitler died. We kept excusing him, but I have a feeling he had a very weird outlook on other people. [He thought] some people were not worthy. You felt it, when he was manipulating others. He wasn’t nice.”Bergman, who died in 2007 at the age of 89, spoke openly of his past sympathies for nazism while growing up in a rightwing Swedish family.In 1999, the directorexplainedto Maria-Pia Boëthius, author of a book questioning Sweden’s neutrality during the second world war, his positive feelings for Hitler after attending a Nazi rally during an exchange trip to Germany in 1934, at the age of 16. “Hitler was unbelievably charismatic. He electrified the crowd,” he said.He added that his family put a photo of the fascist dictator next to his bed after, because “the nazism I had seen seemed fun and youthful.” The book also details how Bergman’s brother and friends vandalized the house of a Jewish neighbor with swastikas – and that he was “too cowardly” to raise objections to the attack.The director also acknowledged his past Nazi sympathies in his 1987 memoir The Magic Lantern: “For many years, I was on Hitler’s side, delighted by his success and saddened by his defeats.” He told Boëthius that he maintained support for the Nazis until the end of the war, when the exposure of Nazi atrocities in the Holocaust changed his views. “When the doors to the concentration camps were thrown open,” he said, “I was suddenly ripped of my innocence.” Bergman went on to explore anguish over the horrors of war in such films as Winter Light, The Silence and Shame.This is not the first time Skarsgård has criticized Bergman openly – in a 2012interviewwith the Guardian’s Xan Brooks, Skarsgård said of Bergman: “I didn’t want him near my life.”“My complicated relationship with Bergman has to do with him not being a very nice guy,” he said at Karlovy Vary. “He was a nice director, but you can still denounce a person as an asshole. Caravaggio was probably an asshole as well, but he did great paintings.”Sentimental Value, which premiered to rave reviews at May’s Cannes film festival, is tipped for awards success later this year.Explore more on these topicsStellan SkarsgårdIngmar BergmanFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

If just one portion of such freshwater fish was eaten each month this would exceed the safe threshold of Pfos for people to consume over a year, according to the NGOs.26:02How 'forever chemicals' have seeped into almost everything – videoPfas, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of thousands of human-made chemicals used in industrial processes and products such as non-stick pans, clothing and firefighting foams. They do not break down in the environment and some are linked to diseases, including cancers and hormone disruption.Pfas pollution is widespread, prompting the EU to propose a new water quality standard that limits the combined toxicity of 24 Pfas to 4.4 nanograms per litre of water, calculated as PFOA-equivalents – a method that weights each substance according to its toxicity relative to PFOA, a particularly hazardous and well-studied carcinogen that is now banned.The EU is also planning to regulate about 10,000 Pfas as one class as there are too many to assess on a case-by-case basis and because none break down in the environment, but the UK has no plans to follow suit.Last week, environment groups, led by the Marine Conservation Society, wrote to ministers, urging a ban on all Pfas in consumer products and a timeline for phasing them out in all other uses. Now, public health and nature groups have joined forces to propose urgent measures to rein in pollution.“Scientists continue to identify Pfas as one of the biggest threats of our time, yet the UK is falling behind other countries in restricting them,” said Hannah Evans of the environmental charity Fidra. “Every day of inaction locks in decades of pollution and environmental harm … we’re asking the UK government to turn off the tap of these persistent forever chemicals.”They say the UK should align with the EU’s group-based Pfas restrictions and ban the substances in food packaging, clothing, cosmetics, toys and firefighting foams, following examples from Denmark, France and the EU. They want better monitoring, tougher water and soil standards and to make polluters cover the cost of Pfas clean-up.Emma Adler, the director of impact at Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “Pfas are linked to an explosion of impacts for wildlife and public health, from cancers to immune issues. These new figures underline just how widespread Pfas pollution is and that Pfas regulation must be a much clearer priority in government missions to clean up UK rivers and improve the nation’s health.”Thalie Martini, the chief executive officer at Breast Cancer UK, said: “Evidence points to the potential for some Pfas to be related to health issues, including increasing breast cancer risk … millions of families affected by this disease will want the government to do everything they can to deliver tougher Pfas rules to protect our health.”Last year, 59 Pfas experts urged the government to follow the science andregulate all Pfas as a single class, warning their extreme persistence – regardless of toxicity – posed a serious environmental threat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Costs to tackle Pfas in the environment and address health impacts have a multi-billion pound economic price tag … the government must not delay.”An Environment Agency spokesperson said the science on Pfas was moving quickly and that it was running a multi-year programme to improve understanding of Pfas pollution sources in England. They added: “We are screening sites to identify potential sources of Pfas pollution and prioritise further investigations, whilst assessing how additional control measures could reduce the risks of Pfas in the environment.”A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The government is committed to protecting human health and the environment from the risks posed by Pfas. That’s why we are working at pace together with regulators to assess levels of Pfas in the environment, their sources and potential risks to inform our approach to policy and regulation.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Then a friend brought urgent news. “Toño, man, there’s a whale caught in a net out there.” Lloreda, 43, had freed other, smaller wildlife from fishing nets but this would be his first marine animal of such size.The four to five metres-long juvenile humpback, accompanied by its mother, had a net studded with hooks wrapped around its fin and mouth. One wrong move could have been fatal for Lloreda or the whale.“To connect with the whale, I used what we call intuitive interspecies communication,” says Lloreda, explaining that this involves non-verbal, energetic communication. “I asked the mother for permission – energetically,” he says. “At first, she didn’t want our help.

Learning to dive has been essential to the community’s efforts to protect their environment, says Neyi Ibargüen, 32, the gulf’s first certified female diver. “Wherever ghost gear lands becomes a cemetery.

Its dramatic calving events, when massive blocks of ice crashed into Lago Argentino, became a symbol of natural wonder, drawing millions of visitors to southern Patagonia.DrLucas Ruiz, a glaciologist at the Argentine Institute of Nivology, Glaciology and Environmental Sciences, said: “The Perito Moreno is a very particular, exceptional glacier. Since records began, it stood out to the first explorers in the late 19th century because it showed no signs of retreat – on the contrary, it was advancing. And it continued to do so until 2018, when we began to see a different behaviour. Since then, its mass loss has become increasingly rapid.”Scientists and local guides warn that the balance is beginning to shift. “The first year the glacier didn’t return to its previous year’s position was 2022. The same happened in 2023, again in 2024, and now in 2025. The truth is, the retreat continues. The glacier keeps thinning, especially along its northern margin,” said Ruiz. This sector is the farthest from tourist walkways and lies above the deepest part of Lago Argentino, the largest freshwater lake in Argentina.View image in fullscreenCalving events at Perito Moreno, when ice collapses into the lake, are becoming louder, more frequent, and much larger.Photograph: Philipp Rohner/Getty Images/500pxThe summer of 2023-24 recorded a maximum temperature of 11.2C, according to meteorological data collected byPedro Skvarca, a geophysical engineer and the scientific director of the Glaciarium centre in El Calafate, Patagonia. Over the past 30 years, the average summer temperature rose by 1.2C, a change significant enough to greatly accelerate ice melt.Ice thickness measurements are equally alarming. Between 2018 and 2022, the glacier was thinning at a rate of 4 metres a year. But in the past two years, that has doubled to 8 metres annually.“Perito Moreno’s size no longer matches the current climate; it’s simply too big. It can’t withstand the heat, and the current ice input isn’t enough to compensate,” Ruiz said.Ice that once rested on the lakebed owing to its weight, said Ruiz, had now thinned so much that it was beginning to float, as water pressure overtook the ice’s own.With that anchor lost, the glacier’s front accelerates – not because of increased mass input from the accumulation zone, where snow compacts into ice, but because the front slides and deforms. This movement triggers a feedback loop that further weakens the structure, making the process potentially irreversible.Xabier Blanch Gorriz, a professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, who studies ice calving at the Perito Moreno glacier front, said: “Describing the change as ‘irreversible’ is complex, because glaciers are dynamic systems. But the truth is that the current rate of retreat points to a clearly negative trend.” He added: “The glacier’s retreat and thinning are evident and have accelerated.”Ruiz confirmed another disturbing trend reported by local guides: calving events are becoming louder, more frequent, and much larger. In April, a guide atLos Glaciares national parkdescribed watching a tower of ice the height of a 20-storey building collapse into the lake. “It’s only in the last four to six years that we’ve started seeing icebergs this size,” he told Reuters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Initial comparisons between December and June already reveal significant ice loss. Satellite images further highlight a striking retreat over just 100 days.Today, nothing seems capable of halting the glacier’s retreat. Only a series of cooler summers and wetter winters might slow the trend, but climate projections point in the opposite direction.“What we expect is that, at some point, Perito Moreno will lose contact with the Magallanes peninsula, which has historically acted as a stabilising buttress and slowed the glacier’s response to climate change. When that happens, we’ll likely see a catastrophic retreat to a new equilibrium position, farther back in the narrow valley,” said Ruiz.Such a shift would represent a “new configuration” of the glacier, raising scientific questions about how this natural wonder would behave in the future. “It will be something never seen before – even farther back than what the first researchers documented in the late 19th century,” Ruiz nadded.How long the glacier might hold that future position remains unknown. But what scientists do know is that the valley, unlike the Magallanes peninsula, would not be able to hold the glacier in place.Perito Moreno – Latin America’s most iconic glacier and part of a Unesco world heritage site since 1981 – now joins a regrettable local trend: its neighbours, the Upsala and Viedma glaciers, have retreated at an astonishing rate over the past two decades. It is also part of a global pattern in which, as Ruiz put it, humanity is “digging the grave” of the world’s glaciers.Explore more on these topicsGlaciersArgentinaClimate crisisAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

They are as much part of our heritage as any literature.”View image in fullscreenThe Argyle Street Ash in Glasgow was described in a 1935 book as ‘quite the most graceful ash I have seen’.Photograph: Douglas Crawford Tree Wise Urban Forestry/PAA panel of experts selected nine trees of differing ages and species for the shortlist, while the public chose a 10th as a wildcard entry.This year David Treanor fromGlasgowput forward the Argyle Street Ash, pointing to its reference in James Cowan’s 1935 book From Glasgow’s Treasure Chest as “quite the most graceful ash I have seen”.The shortlist also includes the Borrowdale Yews inCumbria, a huddle of ancient trees described by William Wordsworth in his 1803 poem Yew Trees.View image in fullscreenA tree that is part of the Borrowdale Yews in Cumbria, a huddle of ancient trees described by William Wordsworth in an 1803 poem.Photograph: James Reader/PAThe Beatles’ Cedar Tree in Chiswick, west London, which is about 300 years old, was nominated because the band perched on one of its low-swooping boughs in a video for their song Rain in 1966.The King of Limbs in Wiltshire made the list afterRadioheadnamed their 2011 album after the ancient oak, which they spotted when recording at nearby Tottenham House.Also nominated is the Tree of Peace and Unity in County Antrim, Northern Ireland – a lime formed of two trees that grew together into a single trunk and became a symbol of reconciliation when leaders met there in 1998 at the signing of the Good Friday agreement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The charity Médecins Sans Frontières said it was a shameful and dangerous pact that was reducing men, women and children to “exchangeable tokens”, while Care4Calais questioned whether “racial profiling” would be used to choose which people were deported back to France.Natacha Bouchart, the mayor of Calais, was also unhappy, saying she believed it would act as a pull factor bringing more people to France hoping to cross into the UK by small boat or to claim asylum legally.Others were more positive, including the Refugee Council which urged the government to make sure the scheme was “implemented in a way that treats all those seeking asylum fairly and with respect and dignity”. The United Nations refugee agency said the deal “could help achieve a more managed and shared approach, offering alternatives to dangerous journeys, while upholding access to asylum”.A spokesperson for theEuropean Commissionon Friday said it would “assess the concrete modalities of this cooperation” and whether it complied with the “spirit and the letter of EU law”.EU to assess legality of UK-France migrant return deal before expressing supportRead moreDespite concerns raised by Italy, Spain, Greece, Malta and Cyprus, British officials are convinced that the EU will end up supporting the deal, while Whitehall sources said there would be little that could be done to stop it going ahead regardless.Steve Peers, a professor of EU law at Royal Holloway, University of London, said the commission could not realistically unpick the deal.“Even if it were that the commission thinks that this breaches EU law, then they can’t order France not to do it. France might say, ‘That’s interesting, we have a different view, we’re going to do it anyway’, and then it would be up to the commission to sue France,” he said.One diplomat from one of the five nations with reservations about the deal said they understood that France had “to give something to the UK to satisfy public opinion” at a time when the EU wants to keep the British government tied into to future defence and security in the face of continued Russian aggression.But the diplomat said there was surprise at the content of the deal. The return of 50 people a week represents one in 17 of the average weekly arrivals by small boats this year so far.“It is difficult to see why the French over-stepped the EU treaties without delivering something more spectacular,” they said. “We do want to help the British government to be engaged withEuropeand that is a priority, but I find it very difficult to see this agreement go smoothly because the French overstepped the mark.”Other nations said the deal with the UK was just “smoke and mirrors” because France can return people to the country of arrival under the EU’s Dublin rules. More than 21,000 people have made the Channel crossing in rudimentary vessels this year.Many details of the scheme remain unclear, such as how many people will be returned, how those involved will be chosen and when it will start.Steve Smith, the chief executive of Care4Calais, said the announcement was a “gimmick that lacks any operational credibility”.“How will those refugees be selected? If our previous experience of supporting people accommodated at sites such as the Wethersfield camp and the Bibby Stockholm barge is anything to go by, then we fully expect this plan will lack any form of sophisticated selection process. Will the government, shamefully, choose to implement some form of racial profiling? Or will people simply be selected at random?” he said.“The indication is that 50 people, chosen at random, will have their human right to claim asylum unilaterally removed. This scheme will have no impact on Channel crossings. Why? Because it fails to recognise that those making the crossing are desperate. They have fled war, conflict and persecution. They may have survived violence and torture during their journey. They are willing to risk their lives to seek safety in the UK, and, as we have seen time and time again, these so-called deterrents will not deter people from seeking safety in the UK.”Louise Calvey, the executive director of Asylum Matters, was also unconvinced, saying it was a “convoluted Rwanda-style gimmick and yet another example of our governments choosing not to implement the only policy that will save lives: safe and accessible routes for all who need them”.Legal experts suggested the deal would be harder to challenge than the Conservatives’ Rwanda plan because people will be returned to France, which is considered a safe country.However, Zoe Bantleman, the legal director of the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, said the process must be fair. “At the moment, we have no details as to how the deal will work in practice, who will be chosen for return, whether it will create another backlog of ‘inadmissible’ asylum claims, leaving people lingering in limbo and detention, how the UK will ensure it does not unlawfully discriminate, or how individual rights and access to justice will be upheld,” she said. “All of these are questions the government will need to answer in the weeks ahead.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumCharitiesEuropean UnionEuropeFranceRefugee WeekKeir StarmerShareReuse this content"

The next of kin for both women have been notified and are being supported by specially trained officers.“Following this sad update, the investigation will now also consider whether the collision contributed to their deaths.”Ch Supt Mark Hall, of Northumbria police, said: “This is an extremely sad development and all of our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of everyone affected. We will continue to support them in any way that we can at this time. Our investigations remain at an early stage, and we would ask people to avoid speculation both online and in the community.”Police urged anyone who may have information about the crash to contact them.Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It is said to include the outsourcing of recommendation algorithms, which direct users to content.There are already significant concerns inside the BBC over the impact the plan could have on UK jobs and its much-lauded scheme to spread roles throughout Britain, as well as the effect it could have on the BBC’s control of its own platforms.The outsourcing programme could lead to job losses at the broadcaster’s hubs in Salford, Glasgow, Newcastle and Cardiff. Departments being looked at for the overhaul include functions within its digital product group, responsible for developing platforms such as News Online, Sport, iPlayer and Sounds, and the finance department.The proposal has been drawn up after advice from external consultants, as Tim Davie, the BBC’s director general, searches for ways to cut the corporation’s costs. It comes at a time when the broadcaster is under serious financial pressure, with the licence fee losing a third of its value since 2010. Half a million people also cancelled their licence fee in 2023, as younger audiencesmove towards YouTube and streamers.There are internal concerns that the plans could lead to a rolling back of the BBC’s much-heralded “across the UK” scheme to move jobs across the country. There has been significant political pressure from the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, to do more to set up various corporation operations outside London.One of the big US technology companies could be involved as potential partners for the outsourced services.Some believe the plans will cut costs for the BBC in the short term, but will leave it without the expertise to make longer-term savings and build its own improvements to platforms like the iPlayer.Insiders are concerned it will leave the BBC tied into contracts that will not be able to adapt amid a rapidly changing media landscape. Others believe recent cuts elsewhere will leave the broadcaster without the procurement, legal or management capacity to properly monitor the contracts.Davie hinted at the plans in a recent keynote speech in the spring, in which he said he was examining “new, major partnerships with the world leading big-tech companies, the hyper scalers”.He said: “We are already working on the media supply chain, the processes behind the scenes that gets content from the camera to screen, from microphone to headphone. This will open up huge creative possibilities. And it will allow us to drive efficiencies and reinvest into world-class content.”The BBC did not deny the plans, but said no firm decisions had been taken. A spokesperson said: “While we wouldn’t comment on any speculation, we have made clear our ambition to innovate and transform, to be able to invest in the content and services audiences love.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Like many organisations, it’s routine to assess different options that could deliver these changes and it would be wrong to suggest decisions have been taken.”There is already growing anger over the proposals. Philippa Childs said the plans ran “totally counter to the growth agenda”. The head of Bectu, the broadcasting union, said: “The suggestion that large functions of the BBC should be outsourced and potentially offshored runs counter to the public interest and is hugely damaging to the unique role the BBC plays in UK PLC.“We are extremely angry that the BBC has been developing these proposals without any discussion with the trade unions and that Bectu has only become aware of the project due to a leak.“It is essential that the BBC makes clear that it is committed to supporting UK jobs. Bectu has consistently argued for fair funding for the BBC, and will continue to do so, but this news plays into the hands of those who want to undermine the BBC and see it shorn of its public service responsibilities.”Explore more on these topicsBBCTim DavieTrade unionsOutsourcingnewsShareReuse this content"

They arrested immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally and there were also at least 10 immigrant children on site, the statement said.‘Reality TV spectacle’: outrage as federal agents raid LA neighborhood with horses and armored carsRead moreFour US citizens were arrested for “assaulting or resisting officers”, the department said. Authorities were offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of one person suspected of firing a gun at federal agents. At least one worker was hospitalized with grave injuries.During the raid, crowds of people gathered outside Glass House Farms at the Camarillo location to demand information about their relatives and protest immigration enforcement. A chaotic scene developed outside the farm that grows tomatoes, cucumbers and cannabis as authorities clad in helmets and uniforms faced off with the demonstrators. Acrid green and white billowing smoke then forced community members to retreat.View image in fullscreenFederal agents block people protesting an Ice immigration raid at a cannabis farm near Camarillo, California, on 10 July 2025.

The company said workers were detained and it is helping provide them with legal representation.“Glass House has never knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors,” the statement said.It is legal to grow and sell cannabis in California with proper licensing. State records show the company has multiple active licenses to cultivate cannabis.On Friday, about two dozen people waited outside the Camarillo farm to retrieve the cars of loved ones and speak to managers about what happened. Relatives of Jaime Alanis, who has worked picking tomatoes at the farm for 10 years, said he called his wife in Mexico during the raid to tell her immigration agents had arrived and that he was hiding with others inside the farm.“The next thing we heard was that he was in the hospital,” Juan Duran, Alanis’ brother-in-law, said in Spanish, his voice breaking.Elizabeth Strater, national vice president of the United Farm Workers, said Alanis was injured after a 30-foot fall from a building during the raid.View image in fullscreenJuan Duran, and his wife, no name given, wait outside Glass House Farms, where a relative was injured during a previous day immigration raid, on 11 July 2025, in Camarillo, California. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/APAfter immigration agents arrived at Glass House’s farm in Camarillo on Thursday morning, workers called family members to let them know authorities were there. Relatives and advocates headed to the farm about 50 miles (80km) north-west of downtown Los Angeles to try to find out what was going on, and began protesting outside.Federal authorities formed a line blocking the road leading through farm fields to the company’s greenhouses. Protesters were seen shouting at agents wearing camouflage gear, helmets and gas masks. The billowing smoke drove protesters to retreat. It wasn’t clear why authorities threw the canisters or if they released chemicals such as teargas.Ventura county fire authorities responding to a 911 call of people having trouble breathing said three people were taken to nearby hospitals.At the farm, agents arrested workers and removed them by bus. Others, including US citizens, were detained at the site for hours while agents investigated.The incident came as federal immigration agents have ramped up arrests in southern California at car washes, farms and Home Depot parking lots, stoking widespread fear among immigrant communities.The mother of an American worker said her son was held at the worksite for 11 hours and told her agents took workers’ cellphones to prevent them from calling family or filming and forced them to erase cell phone video of agents at the site.View image in fullscreenPeople embrace outside Glass House Farms, a day after an immigration raid on the facility, on 11 July in Camarillo, California.

She spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because she feared reprisals from the government.United Farm Workers said in statement that some US citizens are not yet accounted for.Maria Servin, 68, said her son has worked at the farm for 18 years and was helping to build a greenhouse. She said she spoke to her son, who is undocumented, after hearing of the raid and offered to pick him up.“He said not to come because they were surrounded and there was even a helicopter. That was the last time I spoke to him,” Servin, a US citizen, said in Spanish.She said she went to the farm anyway but federal agents were shooting teargas and rubber bullets and she decided it was not safe to stay. She and her daughter returned to the farm Friday and were told her son had been arrested Thursday. They still don’t know where he is being held.“I regret 1,000 times that I didn’t help him get his documents,” Servin said.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastUS immigrationTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It is a 950-page historical novel that she describes as “the history of Brazil told from the point of view of a Black woman”.Recently selected asthe greatest work of Brazilian literature of the 21st century so farby the newspaper Folha de S Paulo, the book achieved the rare combination of both critical and popular success, with more than 180,000 copies sold since its release in 2006.Celebrating Gonçalves’s victory, Lula wrote that the book was his “companion” during his 580 days in prison, “and I always make a point of recommending it to everyone.”Now, the author hopes that her election to the 128-year-old academy – whose primary mission is the preservation of the Portuguese language and Brazilian literature – may help correct what she sees as a longstanding historical injustice.“I’m the first Black woman, but I can’t be the only one,” said Gonçalves, who will be just the sixth woman among the 40 members, or “immortals”, as they refer to themselves. Apart from two Black men and thefirst and only Indigenous writerto join the institution, all the others are white men.“I can’t carry the weight of representing an entire population that continues to be marginalised and that is itself incredibly diverse,” she said.The academy had as its first president a Black man, Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, widely considered the greatest Brazilian writer of all time. Despite still being known as the House of Machado de Assis, the academy has since had only a handful of other Black men as members – something many see as a stark illustration of howracism operatesin a country where more than half the population is of African descent.Poet and translatorStephanie Borges, 40, believes Gonçalves’s election will encourage more Black women to become readers and writers. “When it’s us telling our own stories, we invite those who look like us to come closer to literature,” she said.Cidinha da Silva, 58,author of more than 20 books, is keen to stress that Gonçalves was not elected because she is Black, but “because she is one of the greatest living writers in Brazil”.There were 13 candidates in the running, and of the 31 members who voted in Thursday’s election, 30 chose Gonçalves – the remaining vote went toEliane Potiguara, 74, who had hoped to become the first Indigenous woman to join the academy.Gonçalves had to run a sort of “campaign” – though she emphasises she never asked for votes – in which she sent a copy of her book and a personal letter to each member, and phoned some of them to discuss her work.In 2018, another celebrated Black writer,Conceição Evaristo, 78, also stood for election, but received just one vote.“The academy does need more women, more Black people, Indigenous people, and people from other parts of Brazil,” said Gonçalves. “And I hope that now, from the inside, I can help make that happen.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

As of 7.30pm AEST, Wilga had been airlifted out of the area en route to hospital in Perth for medical attention.“As you can imagine, from the trauma she suffered for the last few days, she’s been obviously through a great deal,” Glynn said.View image in fullscreenCarolina Wilga boards a plane to fly her out of her remote location.Photograph: 7 News“She does have some injuries.

The sails will now rotate daily from 4pm to 2am.“The whole troupe is very happy to find our sails again – these are the sails of Paris,” said Cyrielle, one of the 60 dancers who took part in the street celebration, which was illuminated by a specially commissioned firework display.Founded in 1889, the Moulin Rouge became a global symbol offin-de-siècleParisian nightlife, its famed can-can dancers depicted in paintings by artists such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. An eponymous2001 film by Baz Luhrmanncemented its present-day appeal.The French can-can is believed to have evolved from the final figure of a dance for couples known as thequadrille.It caused considerable scandal when it first became popular as a cabaret act mainly because of its intentionally revealing high kicks.Performed by a line of female dancers, the dance, devised in the early 1920s by Pierre Sandrini, then artistic director of the Moulin Rouge, revolves around the “vigorous manipulation of skirts and petticoats, high kicks, jump splits and cartwheels”.After their collapse,new aluminium sailswere ready in time for the Paris Olympics last July, but it has taken almost a year to build and fit a new electric motor ready to turn them and power the hundreds of red and gold bulbs that stud the display.Explore more on these topicsParisCabaretFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Now 83, Idle is thriving and about to embark on his first UK tour since 1973.Over haddock and chips in London last month, a gentle and friendly Idle answered questions submitted by readers and fellow writers, actors and comedians about his time as a Python, Broadway smash Spamalot – his musical adaptation ofMonty Pythonand the Holy Grail – as well as selfies, Peter Cook and why he feels sorry for the royals.What’s genuinely funny about Donald Trump?Tracey UllmanThere’s nothing funny about Donald Trump. What will be funny is when he leaves office and we have a big party and dance in the streets. Trump seems to have no end of capacity for stupidity. I think he’s a treasonous monster who works for Putin.Every summer I go to France because I can’t stand the news. I can’t stand hearing about that man every minute of every day. They’re completely obsessed by him in the US. It’s like they’re addicted to him.Since you have made so many people happy to laugh or sing out loud, what’s the best thing in a day that gives you a smile?traleebobMy friends are either comedians or musicians, so we play and sing all the time and I like that. It’s lovely because you are not yourself any more. You are part of this human thing going on. What makes me proudest is thatAlways Look on the Bright Side of Lifehas become a funeral song. I find that very moving.View image in fullscreenIdle as Mr Cheeky, looking on the bright side in Monty Python’s Life of Brian, 1979.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyYou’ve taught generations to laugh at death, class, religionand even bad theatre.Is there anything left you haven’t skewered that you still dream of turning into a joke?Catherine Zeta-JonesThat’s a difficult question. If I thought of it, I would! I think the point of comedy is to examine everything. It’s very scary now because they’re stopping comedians at the border and if they have pictures of Trump on their phone they don’t like, they don’t let them in.I’ve had a green card for about 28 years. I’d be proud to be thrown out because I’d be in very select company. The last English comedian to bethrown out of America for political reasons was Charlie Chaplin.Whether you can go too far in comedy depends on who you are. If you’re Lenny Bruce, you would begin by going too far. But I do take note of it. If I’m going to do a tour, I will ask my goddaughter: can I say this? There are certain categories of people you don’t want to offend, who have been laughed at, and that was completely unjust and unfair. But I think you are obliged to question things to have any relevance at all. Otherwise, you’re just telling jokes.I know people coming up and asking for selfies and such would be a problem in the real world, but are you able togo and just sit in a pub for a few drinks orhave a Sunday dinner in peace in public?HarrymeadowsI used to be really unpleasant. Then Robin Williams taught me that that sort of encounter is very important to people. So be nice, not brusque, because they’ll never forget it. But you don’t want to spend 20 minutes with them, so when they come up, I say: “I’m Eric, what’s your name?” Then they become a person and see you as a person, too. There’s a human connection, not some stupid, starry thing. It becomes more normal and easier to leave.View image in fullscreenOlivia Arias, with George Harrison, who she married in 1978, Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam at the premiere of Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Hollywood in July 1975.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlamyGeorge Harrisonagreed to fund Lifeof Brian because he wanted to see it. If he hadn’tbeen so forward-thinking andunfazed by controversy,might we have lost an iconic, groundbreaking movie?Les DennisHe changed my life. We were very close. I was there at his deathbed. He wasn’t frightened of death. Hethought he’d escape rebirth. I said: “I’d give anything to be reborn.” Only thing we ever disagreed on. He still laughed when I said it.A lot of being funny is the lack of a censor mechanism. I said at George’s funeral: “I’d like to thank Marlboro, without whom you wouldn’t be here this morning.” Huge laugh. It’s really not the right thing to say, but also, let’s name the names of people responsible. The way people respond to comedy is not to think and then decide to laugh. They find themselves laughing spontaneously. And they also start to trust that this person will tell the truth no matter what.I think aliens have a sense of humour, because it’s about self-knowledge. Every society has one, as do some animals. AI, meanwhile, can only copy. I don’t think it would ever say something remarkably and originally funny. That’s its weakness.Do you listen to audiobooks?RDMillerI’m a big reader but it’s the voice of the author I want to hear in my head. I think a lot of the audiobook business is a scam. They pay badly. They rip you off and you work for days reading the damn thing. And I never want to hear my voice back.I’ve read, presumably based on Monty Python andBeyond the Fringe,that nice people went to Oxford, and not so nice people went to Cambridge. Any thoughtson this?MaldontykeThat’s absolute bollocks. All politicians went to Oxford, because they do PPE, and the nice, clever people went to Cambridge. I like Cambridge people.Which comedian, from any time, do you believe would havecomplemented the Pythons ensemble?BanjoPlayingFoolDan Aykroyd, because he was a writer and a performer and could melt his ego into a crowd. On the whole, we didn’t try and upstage each other on Python. You were supportive.View image in fullscreenIdle in front of Palace theatre, London, while themusical Spamalotwas being set up in 2006.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianWithout going into specific facts and figures, how muchmoremoney have you made from Spamalot thanMonty Python’s Flying Circus and, given that many of the core elements were generated from the efforts of the whole circus,do your former comedy teammates get a ton of royalties from Spamalot?(I’m assuming not).DrJWCCThey got more fucking money than they’ve ever been grateful for. They got fucking millions and they’re miserable and horrible and bitchy about it. I spent 20 years working for Python and then two years on the O2 show. They were there for two weeks.I’m not really motivated by money, to be honest. Anyway, the producers get all the fucking money and divide it up according to the contract. Someone sued us for years, saying I was paying the Pythons money from my back pocket. And I said: why would I risk going to an American jail to give John Cleese more money?Pythons always played the women – why? Michael Palin told me it was because you were all scared of them.Tracey UllmanWell, he’s definitely scared of them. I wasn’t scared of women because when I was president of Footlights, then an all-male club, I changed the laws to admit women. The first woman who came in was Germaine Greer. It’s always hard to find a funny woman if you don’t admit them to the club. I was very proud of doing that.I think some of them were scared of women. John Cleese and Graham Chapman were very nasty to Miriam MargolyesI think the reason was that six people were just trying to grab a decent role. But if the joke was about sex, it was better if we had a real woman – it was weird otherwise. But if it was about our mothers, it was funnier it we played them.I think some of themwerescared of women.John Cleese and Graham Chapman were very nasty to Miriam Margolyesand she’s hated them ever since. I always have to remind her that we were friends and I stayed at her apartment. It wasn’t all of us. But most of that generation were terribly cruel.In the early70s, I was toldthat “Nurse Idle”, who gave me my school vaccinations, was in fact yourmum. Could this have been true, or have I been living under a heinous misapprehension for50 odd years. If itistrue, then it counts as the closest I’ve ever got to a celebrityConradTurnerOh yes, that’s true. She did give school vaccinations andshe would have hated Robert F Kennedy Jrbecause she knew how important they were.I love your songs and sing them frequently, including the now unacceptableILike Chinese, which increasingly just sounds like pragmatic foreign policy. But how did it feel in those early days being the Python who wasn’t part of a writing team, given there was Chapman/Cleese and Jones/Palin, and then Gilliam as the fully odd one out?Steve CooganI don’t like being part of a writing team because I don’t like talking before lunch. I wake about 5:30am and love discovering what’s in your mind. You don’t judge it, you just find it, write it and create it, and then do a lot of rewriting.View image in fullscreen‘We bonded immediately’ … Idle, left, with George Harrison and John Cleese in Monty Python’s Life of Brian.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyWhat was hard was that the other Pythons had two votes to one. When I first met George Harrison, we bonded immediately and talked all night and I realised we played the same roles in our groups. There were these two heavy, powerful blocs, and we were in the middle. We didn’t have as much power but we learned a lot from it.And actually I did find somebody I could work with: the musician John Du Prez, who was a brilliant partner for 44 years. He could do everything I couldn’t and it was fabulous.Other than George Harrison, what was your relationship like with the other three Beatles? Did you count them as friends too?JwillchadI’m still a friend of Ringo’s, and Paul’s always very nice and friendly, but we’re not close.If you could have written one song, which one would it be, and why?ThankYouJohnSong to the Moon, from the opera Rusalka by Dvořák. Beautiful. Unbelievably fine. But I don’t feel: oh gosh, I wish I’d written, say, a Beatles song, because they did it so well.You always seemed to perform so unselfconsciously and with so much abandon and joy – and write so efficiently and quickly and confidently.Was there ever a timeyou were insecure about your work,either as a writer or an actor?And if so, what did you do to overcome those self-doubts and nerves?Hank AzariaI think the answer to that isars est celare artem– “the art is to hide the art”, which is the motto of the Footlights. There’s a great deal of work and effort that goes into making it look effortless. The secret of performing comedy is to really know what you’re gonna do.Even now, I’m never secure, but always exploring and trying to improve. I don’t feel I write; I feel I rewriteWhenever you start, you’re insecure. If you feel secure, you’re a bit of an arsehole. And even now, I’m never secure, but always exploring and trying to improve. I don’t feel I write; I feel I rewrite. Spamalot was about 17 drafts. It got better as my mind resolved things. That’s what I do when I perform: I write a draft, and another, and I keep going until I’m confident with every bit. It’s always a theorem for me: if I say this, they may laugh. And then you find out.I remember once that the Pythons were on the Tonight Show. We’d been over in Canada touring and they laughed like crazy at everything we did. But on the Tonight Show they were just silent. We did 20 minutes, then ran outside and we laughed and laughed and laughed. There’s nothing funnier than people not laughing at you.The day this will be published is my birthday, so, relatedto that, whathas been your favourite celebration of your birthday?NanuI think the older you get, the less you like to celebrate your birthday. On my 80th, I had my friend Puddles do a Pity Party. I don’t like being the centre of attention like that. It’s a bit embarrassing. In my private life, I’m not well-known; I come somewhere below the dogs. Nobody goes: “Oh, good morning, legend!” I live a very quiet life.View image in fullscreenPeter Cook, right, with the cast of Beyond the Fringe, from left, Jonathan Miller, Alan Bennett, and Dudley Moore in 1964.Photograph: Ronald GrantWhich comedian, living or dead, do you most admire?Jane LeevesPeter Cook, Billy Connolly, Robin Williams, Eddie Izzard. I would say my comedic voice is somewhere between Eric Morecambe and Peter Cook. When I was growing up, I loved Frankie Howerd and Jimmy Edwards. Comedians used to go from place to place doing the same act and lots of them were really funny but TV finished them off, because they couldn’t adapt or write enough new material.In the oncoming revolution that may sweep the UK, whose side will you be on – and what to do with the royals?DarknessI don’t think there’ll be a revolution in England. They’ve already screwed my life up, anyway. Eight years ago [pre-Brexit], I could live in any country in Europe. Now, I can only spend three months a year in my house in Provence, and I built the bloody place.I’ve lived in LA for 30 years, but it seems to me that the UK class system is still just as prevalent. I think it’s a complete waste of time and it filters down. It stops some people – and it spoils others.View image in fullscreenInspiration … Frankie Howerd at the Lyric, Hammersmith, in 1990.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianI feel really sorry for the royals. Sometimes they’re very nice and human, and other times they become monsters, because if you are called “Sir” at five, you are putting trouble into people. King Charles is very funny. He was at Cambridge. He did comedy and loved Spike Milligan and would always come to Billy Connolly’s. But it’s not a society I would be happy to live in.The thing I like about America is it created itself; it’s the only place that wrote a script for itself. But it needs a rewrite to bring it up to date. The second amendment says at 16 you are allowed a major weapon of war. I really think they’re serious about wanting to get rid of liberals and lefties. They’re very crazy.You’ve described feeling abandoned when you were placed in a boarding school agedseven, and you’ve also said you like living in the USbecause you’re “more comfortable not feeling a part of everything”. Do you think the sense of detachment that comes from being a foreigner is always a response to childhood trauma?CharlesosbournepragueYes, I was abandoned, but I like being a foreigner. I like living in France because they’re very nice to me, and it isn’t my culture so you don’t have to worry. And it’s slightly like that in America.View image in fullscreenWith his daughter, Lily, and wife, Tania, in Hollywood, in 2002.Photograph: Maury Phillips/WireImageWhen I’m in the UK, I miss the wife and the daughter, but when I’m in the US I don’t really miss the UK because I have the football and cricket on.Are you going to smashTitus Andronicus orIago for us one of these days? Or is“shouting at night”, as Ralph Richardson once calledit,too damned tiring? I’d queue overnight for you.Janet SuzmanNo, I’ve done my Shakespeare, back in Cambridge. I couldn’t do it every night. I don’t know how people do Broadway – eight performances a week! On tour, I insist on having a night off after each show. The audience want your energy.

On the first show I hosted, John Belushi impersonated Joe Cocker to his face. They sang together and there was something magical about that.Are you happy to be captured by AI for posthumous performances and royalties?Tracey UllmanThey don’t pay royalties. I always felt that we ought to protect our images after I saw that tacky advert with Fred Astaire and the vacuum cleaner. I felt very bad about that.

But despite returning to obscurity, the artists say they’re not (sun)burnt by fameMichael HannFri 11 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 03.16 EDTShareUntil 1982, if you wanted to go on holiday, you had to go to a high street travel agent, who would generally make a bunch of phone calls and tell you to come back later. Then Thomson Holidays introduced the first computerised booking system and pricing was deregulated – enter the golden age of Brits-on-tour package trips to Benidorm, Torremolinos and the other resorts scattered along the Costa del Sol.It created a curious phenomenon of its own: the hit single the holidaymakers brought home. Plenty of 1980s European artists won a single hit, perhaps two, in the UK before slinking back into obscurity or – just as often – back into the domestic or continental stardom they already had before the British deigned to take an interest. For a few weeks, their names were inescapable: Spagna, Sabrina, Modern Talking, Desireless, Baltimora, Opus, Nena. Then they became pub quiz answers.View image in fullscreen‘Bamboléo blew me away’ … Gipsy Kings.Photograph: François Roboth/Sygma/Getty ImagesAmong the travellers going out to Spain was the Radio 1 DJ Gary Davies, who championed many of the big 80s Europop hits on his afternoon show. “There were two main places I would go,” he says. “Marbella and then Ibiza, which I discovered in 1986. I’d be out in bars and in clubs all the time and hearing a lot of European music. For example, I heard Bamboléo by Gipsy Kings in Ibiza and it just blew me away. I got hold of a copy while I was there, brought it back, played it on the radio and the reaction was so great that they got a record deal in the UK.”Europop hits could grow from seemingly infertile soil. Opus were an Austrian band who made music not unlike Supertramp – prog-inflected pop-rock – and had grown an audience first in their home country and then in Italy. After four albums, they were popular enough to justify recording a live album, for which the guitarist and songwriter Ewald Pfleger decided to write a new song. “We were playing to about 5,000 people and my aim was to compose a song for them [to sing],” he says. “So I had to use a simple melody and simple words. We had to do it twice, the second time at the end of the show, and of course the second time was much better, because the audience knew the song. They sang and clapped with us – and that was the birth of a worldwide hit.”The song was the cheesily stirring Live Is Life, which in 1985 and 1986 spread around the world, its one-size-fits-all lyrics finding universal popularity: “When we all give the power / We all give the best / Every minute of an hour / Don’t think about the rest.” For the best part of two years, Opus toured globally to promote it. “We had been together for 12 years and our aim was to get successful outside Austria, outside Europe. So when it happened, we took it as it was,” Pfleger says.But when Live Is Life had faded, those outside the Germanic world no longer cared. “It’s just a fact,” Pfleger says. “It’s not easy for Austrian acts. Falco didn’t get the chance to have a second hit after Rock Me Amadeus and it was the same for us.”View image in fullscreenNena (Gabriele Kerner) in the early 1980s.Photograph: United Archives/Getty ImagesNena were a young West Berlin band, loosely associated with theneue Deutschewelle(new German wave) of the early 80s, who wanted their third single to be an anti-war rock song called 99 Luftballons. “That created quite a panic at our record label,” says the band’s eponymous singer (born Gabriele Kerner). “Their main argument was that the song didn’t have a chorus and wasn’t commercial enough.”But the song became a huge smash in Europe – full of brash energy, it had “one of the best hooks of the 80s”, according to themusician and writer Scott Miller, despite its “embarrassingly out-of-place disco-funk interlude”. And like so many other Europop smashes, it owed success in the anglosphere to a DJ.“Rodney Bingenheimer of KROQ in LA caused our breakthrough,” Nena says. “Christiane F [the German actor and musician] was invited to Rodney’s radio show and she brought a suitcase of her favourite German music, which included our first album. He loved the song and played it up to seven times a day and other radio stations followed suit. Before any label even realised it would be worth releasing us, we already had a chart entry in America.”99 Luftballons reached No 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in December 1983. Britain (and Canada, Australia and South Africa) had to wait until the following year for 99 Red Balloons, an English-language version whose lyrics the band didn’t really warm to, but which became a monster hit in turn.Nena remained a huge star – the most successful female singer in German chart history – but those 99 balloons were the beginning and end of her UK chart career (the follow-up, Just a Dream, peaked at No 70). But, as she points out, they were all so young that no thought was given to capitalising on that hit.“The word career didn’t even exist in our vocabulary,” she says. “We never analysed or sought explanations. I was just fulfilled experiencing so many beautiful and exciting things. None of us expected our success and when it happened we celebrated and lived it to the fullest.”View image in fullscreenSwinging it … James McShane of Baltimora promoting Tarzan Boy.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyEuropop smashes often live on in the mind, partly because they are unusual, and partly because that novelty makes them powerful signifiers, easy to use in films to mark a time and place. Nena’s hit was used in, among many others, Grosse Pointe Blank, Boogie Nights, The Wedding Singer, Atomic Blonde and Despicable Me 3; even Baltimora’s Tarzan Boy ended up on a few soundtracks.Live Is Life, though, secured a strange afterlife. For one thing, it became a staple of sports arenas around the world (and its popularity soared again once YouTube came along, thanks to a clip of Diego Maradona doing keepy-uppies in time to it). For another, it was given one of pop’s most extraordinary reimaginings when the Slovenian art band Laibach rearranged it into a terrifying martial statement, in English and German.In the bland call to unity of the original lyrics, Laibach found something else and rewrote it asLeben heißt Leben.“Mediocrity in language is a powerful weapon – it strips words of resistance and makes them infinitely adaptable,” they say via email. “The hollow optimism of old Eurohits offers a perfect canvas for reinterpretation, subversion and reappropriation. These songs were never truly about any meaningful meaning – popular culture rarely understands itself – and when we reinterpret these songs, we simply help them discover their deeper, often unintended, potential.”But why remake it in that way? “Songs are not innocent; beneath every sweet song lies a hidden command. Our version only amplifies what was already present: the spirit of order, discipline and collective will. If it now sounds like a marching anthem, it is because the DNA was always there, waiting to be activated. Nostalgia, nationalism, conformity – these are not our inventions. They are the silent architects of European history, European order, and they are behind much of European pop culture, too. We only turned up the volume.”Sex, Mozart and chanting monks … the 20 best Euro-pop UK hits – ranked!Read moreAnd what does Pfleger make of that rendering of his song? “I don’t like it,” he says, his face souring. “You know, they never contacted us since they did it. It has no positive feeling and more a dark, bad energy.”Big holiday hits flourished in the 90s and 00s, too – The Ketchup Song, Macarena – but they were clearly recorded as novelties, in a way most of the 80s hits had not been. Today, Europop hits blossom in micro-moments on TikTok, while globalised streaming culture means that when you’re poolside in Spain or Greece, you are more likely to hear Bad Bunny, Sabrina Carpenter or some generic tropical house than a homegrown hit to export back home alongside a novelty fridge magnet.That means Pfleger and Nena seem all the more like outliers – but they remain delighted by the songs that changed their lives for a summer or two. “I’m very proud that an Austrian band had this success,” Pfleger says. “I wrote more than 200 songs and it is very special to have one that so many people liked.” 99 Luftballons means Nena’s name is instantly recognisable: she will be touring this October, with a London show lined up. “I love that song,” she says.Nena playsO2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire, London, on 11 OctoberDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Their friend Dylan Mortensen, who lived just a few houses away, heard strange noises during the night and was scared. Her four upstairs roommates weren’t answering their phones – could they come over and check on things? Johnson and Alandt weren’t particularly concerned, Moscow being a quiet college town of unlocked doors, until they reached 1122 King Road. The usually boisterous residence, the node of a sprawling friend group, was eerily quiet. Johnson proceeded up the stairs and into the bedroom where his best friend, Ethan Chapin, 20, was staying over with his girlfriend, Xana Kernodle, also 20. Then, to spare the others the trauma of a ghastly sight, he told the girls to call 911 for an “unconscious individual”.By now, the clinical facts of the University ofIdahomurders, as they have become known, have been published and republished, dissected to death online and seared into the consciousness of even casual news consumers. So One Night in Idaho: The College Murders, a new Amazon docuseries that includes, for the first time, extensive interviews with Johnson, Alandt and other close friends and family, takes a different approach – not a chronology of the murders of Chapin, Kernodle and her roommates, Madison Mogen, 21 and Kaylee Goncalves, 21, but how the crime and its nuclear fallout landed on their loved ones. How much confusion ensued in the hours after the 911 call, as more and more friends, including Chapin’s fellow triplets, Hunter and Maizie, gathered outside the house, while police searched and said nothing; the group got confirmation that their friends had died not from officers on the scene, but from a campus shelter-in-place alert to their phones.Idaho student stabbings suspect pleads guilty to murder to avoid death penaltyRead more“In the crime genre, the majority of those are told through the lens of an investigator or law enforcement or a journalist,” Matthew Galkin, co-director of the series with Liz Garbus, said. “We wanted to flip the script with this one because we felt like that was the part of the story that hadn’t been told yet.”Plenty of other stories were – within hours of the discovery, the four murders made international news. Reporters from outlets around the countrydescendedon the small, formerly quiet community in the northern Idaho panhandle. The house at 1122 King Road became not only an active crime scene but a grim tourist attraction, drawing amateur sleuths and true crime enthusiasts who posted photos of blood dripping down the house’s foundation. The tragedy was catnip for widespread attention – four photogenic, white, very online kids whose public social media profiles provided ample material for amateur sleuths; the group posed and posted classically college photos, all tangled together before a football game, the day before they were brutally stabbed to death. Authorities revealed next to no information – no leads, no suspected motive, no known connections to a killer at large. Plenty of space for sideline conjecture, or as Galkin put it, “a perfect storm for that kind of social media scrutiny”.The first two episodes of the series relive those horrific initial six weeks for friends and family, as they were bombarded with media requests, unsolicited direct messages or accusations of murder themselves, on top of unimaginable grief. Anonymous websites argued that Johnson – the kid that found his best friend murdered — was the killer, based on his friends’ social media snippets. Amateur sleuths snuck into classes and dorms. Others tried to access the house, still roped off with caution tape. “All of a sudden there are blueprints of the house and people are making 3D models,” Galkin said. “It just became almost like a game to people.” For those close to the victims, so-called Reddit detectives and anonymous DMs threatening retribution were just as scary as the fact that the real killer was still at large. “I was once again fearing for my life but for a completely different reason,” Daniel Berriochoa, Chapin’s fraternity brother and one of the last people to see him alive, recalls in the series.‘We were powerless’: inside the devastating Ohio State sexual abuse scandalRead moreDirect threats aside, “I don’t think the majority of people were malicious in what they were doing. I certainly think there was a legitimate desire to solve this,” said Galkin. But the naming of suspects in public went “haywire” – “these people aren’t law enforcement. They’re not lawyers. They have no right to pick people they don’t know and accuse them of horrific crimes and then just sit back and watch it all happen.”Six weeks after the murders, authorities arrested Bryan Kohberger, a 28-year-old criminology student at Washington State University, a 15-minute drive over the border from Idaho’s campus, at his parents’ house in Pennsylvania. According to a probable cause affidavit, investigators found him based on DNA evidence from the button of a knife sheath left at the scene. One would think an arrest would tamp down speculation, but new questions only fueled it – why did he do it? How did he know the victims? Why did he leave two – Mortensen and Bethany Funke – unscathed? It was at this point that Galkin and Garbus entered the picture and began speaking with families about telling their side of the story. As with Garbus’srecent serieson the Gilgo Beach serial killer, there would be hard rules: “We go by facts. We do nothing salacious. We do nothing gratuitous,” said Galkin. There would be no blood, no bodies, just recreations of the victims’ rooms as they would have existed prior. “We can have people tell us the story and infer visually what happened, but you don’t have to go there.”There is a time and a place for amateur sleuthing. But there’s also a human tollMatthew Galkin, co-director of seriesThough grounded in first-hand experiences, the series stays attuned to larger forces – online speculation, the ongoing information vacuum from authorities after a court’s gag order, and Kohberger’s potential links to hyper-misogynistic incel (“involuntary celibate”) ideology. The latter half of the series speculates that Kohberger posted creepy questions about the murders – which hand did he use? Did he shower at the house after? – in a large true crime Facebook group as “Pappa Rodger”, perhaps in a nod to “incel hero” Elliot Rodger, who killed six and injured 14 during amurderous rampagein California in 2014. Rodger targeted an Alpha Phi sorority house andleft behindmanifestos and videos railing against women who rejected him. Goncalves was a member of Alpha Phi at the University of Idaho, while Kernodle and Mogen were members of Pi Beta Phi.The question undergirding all this attention remains: why? “We went as far as we could possibly go with answering that question without having actual facts because there was no process of discovery and there was no trial,” said Galkin. But based on what has been revealed, “I don’t believe that it was a completely random act of violence,” he said. “He didn’t just pick four strangers. I feel like there was at least one of them that he had tracked at least somewhat.”View image in fullscreenBryan Kohberger.Photograph: Kyle Green/APWhatever evidence investigators found of Kohberger’s intentions, or any connection to the victims, remains an open question that may never be answered. Earlier this month, Kohbergerpleaded guiltyto all four murders, thus avoiding a long-delayed trial scheduled for next month as well as the death penalty. He will spend the rest of his life in prison without parole, pending a judge’s acceptance of the deal later this month. The deal, a week before the series aired, “caught us all off guard”, Galkin said. “There were some grumblings that it was possible, but I didn’t actually think it would happen.”‘Their voices had been overlooked for so long’: the shocking hunt for the Gilgo Beach killerRead moreImmediately, some loved ones vehemently opposed it; in a statement, the Goncalves family, who did not participate in the series, said they were “beyond furious” at a “very unexpected decision” they did not consider to be justice. Others who did – including the Chapins and Mogen’s mother and stepfather – expressed support, relieved not to endure the trauma of a long trial with graphic evidence and the possibility that Kohberger walked free. “We can actually put this behind us and not have these future dates and future things that we don’t want to have to be at, that we shouldn’t have to be at, that have to do with this terrible person,” Mogen’s father, Ben, told CBS. “We get to just think about the rest of lives and have to try and figure out how to do it without Maddie and the rest of the kids.”Galkin and Garbus added a title card explaining the outcome at the end of the final episode, though it does not change its focus: remembering how the four victims lived, in the words of the people who actually knew them. Mogen was sweet, quiet and slyly funny with her distinctive dance moves; Goncalves was ambitious and sparkly; “DJ Xan” Kernodle insisted on bringing her MacBook computer everywhere to play her music; Chapin never missed an opportunity to make people laugh.And for Galkin and Garbus, to offer a true crime series that warns against the obsession with true crimes concerning real people. “There is a time and a place for amateur sleuthing. But there’s also a human toll,” said Galkin. “Hopefully, this series allows you to look in their eyes and just understand what this is doing to people. Maybe people might think twice before they do this on the next enormous crime story.”One Night in Idaho: The College Murders is now available on Amazon Prime VideoExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryIdahoFactual TVTelevisionUS crimeAmazon Prime VideofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Turner (Eric Bana) is a difficult man – he’s a special agent whose job is to enforce the law in the vast wilderness of Yosemite National Park. He’s also blunt, rude and the kind of sad solo drinker who calls his ex-wife at 2.30am. When a woman dies after plunging from a cliff, his colleagues are keen to write it off as suicide. But Turner suspects that isn’t the whole story. Will his boss Paul Souter (Sam Neill) and his new partner from LA Naya Vasquez (Lily Santiago) put up with him long enough to find out? A slow-burner but gripping too.Phil HarrisonNetflix, from Thursday 17 JulyThe InstituteView image in fullscreenTicks all the boxes … (from left) Fionn Laird as Nicky Wilholm, Mary-Louise Parker as Ms Sigsby and Simone Miller as Kalisha in The Institute.Photograph: Chris Reardon/MGM+Jack Bender (who worked on the teams behind From and Lost) directs this latestStephen King adaptation, starring Ben Barnes and Mary-Louise Parker, and executive produced by King himself. Luke (Joe Freeman) is a genius teenager who is kidnapped and wakes at a facility called The Institute run by Ms Sigsby (Parker), where all the residents are children who have unusual abilities. When former police officer Tim (Barnes) moves nearby, he doesn’t get the quiet retirement he dreamed of when his world collides with Luke’s. A classic trippy King thriller that ticks all the boxes.Hollie RichardsonMGM+, from Sunday 13 JulyLadies in BlackView image in fullscreenBreaking free … (from left) Debi Mazar as Magda, Clare Hughes as Lisa and Roxie Mohebbi as Nadia in Ladies in Black.Photograph: Ben King /Bunya Entertainment/UKTVSet in Sydney’s fictional Goodes department store in 1961,this dramafinds Australia poised on the brink of the sexual revolution. Accordingly, the young women in the shop (variously arty, troubled, bookish and rebellious) strain against boundaries set by previous generations – some of them even scandalously discussing premarital sex. It’s a decent premise but the reality doesn’t quite match up: the dialogue is clunky and, while there’s a vague theme of women revolting against patronising men, there’s no real polemical bite so it feels a little bland.PHU, out nowThe Summer I Turned PrettyView image in fullscreenLove triangle … (from left) Sean Kaufman as Steven, Gavin Casalegno as Jeremiah and Lola Tung as Belly in The Summer I Turned Pretty.Photograph: Erika Doss/PrimeAllcoming-of-agedramas have a natural endpoint and, sensibly, this is the final season of the hit Gen Z glossy love triangle saga. Belly (Lola Tung) has wobbled between hunky brothers Conrad (Christopher Briney) and Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno) for long enough and her course seems set. She’s finished her junior year of college and she’s set to marry Jeremiah. But what do you know? Conrad is back and he’s grown up: he’s a doctor now and has a new sense of purpose and perspective. Surely Belly isn’t going to blow up her love-life yet again? Don’t bet against it.

At some point during the trip, she vanished without trace and hasn’t been seen since. This intriguing documentary explores the circumstances around her disappearance and considers the many theories posited by those who knew her, including the most tantalising one of all: could Amy still be alive? The likeliest explanation is, of course, a tragic accident but there have been a series of alleged sightings and encounters with women claiming to be Amy in subsequent years.

However, half a century of Jaws also means half a century of Jaws sequels, which is a different kind of fun. This week, Netflix has gathered together all four films for viewers to enjoy at their leisure. The question is: which should you watch? The peerless original? Jaws 2, which is basically a remake of the first one?Jaws 3, which was shot for 3D seemingly just for the scene where a shark gets exploded? Or Jaws: The Revenge, in which a shark with a vendetta chases Michael Caine around the Bahamas? Strictly speaking, only one of these films is good. But, in their own way, they are all great.Tuesday 15 July, NetflixOppenheimerView image in fullscreenA total marvel … Cillian Murphy in Oppenheimer.Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/APAfter its extraordinary theatrical run and silverware haul, it’s safe to assume that everyone who wants to watchOppenheimerhas already watched it. But even after all the ballyhoo about seeing it on the big screen, Christopher Nolan’s film loses very little impact on TV. It’s still a total marvel, turning a bog-standard biopic into a puzzlebox of clashing timelines. It’s still masterly to look at, transforming the planes of Cillian Murphy’s face into grand topography. Best of all, we get to see what Robert Downey Jr looks like when he really puts his all into acting. A must watch.Saturday 12 July, NetflixA Man Called OttoView image in fullscreenNailing it … Tom Hanks and Mariana Treviño in A Man Called Otto.Photograph: Niko TaverniseHis days as the do-no-wrong king of Hollywood behind him, Tom Hanks has long since settled into a much more rewarding second act. He writes books. He’s become a Wes Anderson day-player. And, more importantly, he gets to star in films likeA Man Called Otto. Hanks plays a bitter old crank who plans to kill himself, only to be shaken out of his stupor when he begins to integrate with his neighbours. It’s a hard role to pull off – lean too hard one way and you become repellant, lean too hard the other and you become unpleasantly sentimental – but Hanks gets it exactly right.Saturday 12 July, 9pm, Channel 4Passport to PimlicoView image in fullscreenThe greatest Ealing comedy ever made … Stanley Holloway and Barbara Murray in Passport to Pimlico.Photograph: Studiocanal Films Ltd/AlamyVery possibly the greatestEaling comedyever made, Passport to Pimlico has one of the most wonderful premises of the 20th century; thanks to a confusing legal loophole, an area of Pimlico is declared part of Burgundy. As such, a forgotten bit of Westminster ends up breaking away from the rest of the country and becoming its own self-governing micronation, with all the greed and pettiness that comes with it. It might have been made in 1949, but the themes in Passport to Pimlico feel incredibly current, especially in post-Brexit Britain.Sunday 13 July, 1.50pm, BBC Twoskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the surface, Dog is a Turner and Hooch rip-off about an army ranger who has to escort his dead friend’s dog across the country to be put down. However, the amount of layers Tatum manages to fold in is incredible. There’s comedy, and a surprisingly clear-eyed take on mental health in the military. And you’ll probably cry at the end. So much better than it needed to be.Monday 14 July, 7pm, Film4Hell Is a CityView image in fullscreenA stunning noir … Hell Is a City.Photograph: Ronald GrantTo be specific, hell is Manchester. This stunning1960 British noirhas plenty going for it, like its tight, hardboiled plot – an inspector is tasked with tracking down a murderer following a jailbreak – and the gruffly unsentimental performances from Stanley Baker and John Crawford. It deserves to be rediscovered and heralded as a classic. However, Hell Is a City was also a rare film shot in Manchester, which means that it provides a wonderful snapshot of the city as it was 65 years ago. To call it unrecognisable would be an understatement.Tuesday 15 July, 2:20pm, Film4Juror #2View image in fullscreenKeeps you torn till the very end … Nicholas Hoult in Juror #2.Photograph: Claire Folger/Warner Bros.Clint Eastwood is 95, and the likelihood is thatJuror #2will be his final movie. Criminally overlooked by its own studio, which attempted to dump it on to streaming without a theatrical release, this is arguably his best film for 20 years. A tight legal thriller about a journalist (played by Nicholas Hoult) who is called up for jury duty only to realise he may be responsible for the victim’s death, the film quickly becomes a knotty morality play designed to keep you torn till the very end. If this is Eastwood’s last work, he’s going out on a high.Friday 18 July, 8pm, Sky Cinema PremiereThis article was amended on 11 July 2025 to correct the main image caption.

Consumed in one sitting – so long, so many songs performed at such an unwavering high intensity – anyone undecided might find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer onslaught of the thing. But if you are ready for the plunge, Jon M Chu’s Wizard of Oz prequel is an extravaganza. The performances are fantastic, especially Ariana Grande, whose years spent toiling down the Disney Channel mines manifest themselves in a remarkable lightness of touch. The ambition is faultless. And if you aren’t moved by the walloping final performance of Defying Gravity, you may be dead inside.Stuart HeritageZombies 4: Dawn of the Vampires (Paul Hoen, 2025),Disney+View image in fullscreenDead cool … Malachi Barton heads the vampire pack in Zombies 4.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyIf you are an adult with unfiltered access to the broad sweep of horror, perhaps Disney’s Zombies franchise has passed you by. But if you are a child – sufficiently interested in horror to want to dip your toes in, but not quite ready for outright gore – Zombies is manna from heaven. It’s High School Musical, in essence, but with a vaguely supernatural bent. Previous instalments have introduced werewolves and aliens; this time, we get vampires. Featuring songs such as Don’t Mess With Us and Kerosene, it’s lightweight fluff, but highly enjoyable.SHExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightReality TVNoel EdmondsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The short anthology has no credited editor and urges its reader to “discover the amazing power of poetry to make even the most f*cked up times feel better”. The poems themselves are mostly well-known, short and by 20th-century and contemporary writers: the attention-grabbing, gifting-ready packaging ultimately contains what it might call the “same old sh*t”.Perhaps baritoneJames Newbyand pianistJoseph Middletonimagined that taking this collection as the basis for a song recital would bring new audiences to art song. If so, the half-empty auditorium at Kings Place for this final concert in its Platoon Presents series wasn’t encouraging. Or perhaps the collection’s narrative arc from fury and frustration via calls for action to a recognition of life’s wonders seemed ripe for exploration in song. In that case, it was a shame that the logic for matching songs and poems from the collection – the latter read by Bridgerton starAdjoa Andoh– relied mainly on pivoting between key words rather than mood or meaning. ThusMaya Angelou’s Still I rise(its anthemic power blistering in Andoh’s performance) was followed by Herbert Howells’ song King David: its Walter de la Mare text is galaxies away from Angelou’s poem, but there’s a lovely key change on the phrase “He rose”.View image in fullscreenPianist Joseph Middleton and baritone James Newby in Recital for a World Gone to Sh*t at Kings Place, London.Photograph: Monika S. JakubowskaThe result was a programme dominated by art-song favourites, enlivened by a few less obvious choices. In Schubert’s Totengräbers Heimweh, Newby ranged between full-throttle fury and wide-eyed whispering, while Strauss’s Ruhe, Meine Seele featured almost no vibrato, his baritone chilled and chilling. Elsewhere there was boyish charm in Schubert’s Hoffnung and a showcase for Newby’s exquisitely lucid upper register in Percy Grainger’s Willow, Willow. Middleton’s playing travelled still further, from a touch so delicate you might forget that pianos have hammers to vicious, nasty clanging in Hanns Eisler’s Der Sohn 1. Yet alongside Andoh’s shape-shifting delivery of poems by Larkin and Dickinson, Lear and McNish, the absence of texts or translations or even names of poets for the songs exacerbated the impression that these musical performances – excellent in other ways – simply had less to say.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicAdjoa AndohreviewsShareReuse this content"

A scan of her artist page on any streaming service offers a gratifying biography of an artist slowly but surely chipping away at her style in search of a distinct point of view: the lounge jazz stylings of 2020’s Dead End World give way to piquant, post-King Krule bedroom pop on 2022’s Leak Your Own Blues and Billie Eilish-ish pathos on 2023’s Steps EP.What could feel like a dog’s dinner of genres is held together by Meth’s warm, laconic voice and knack for resplendent but pathologically small-scale production. Winnies, a song from last year’s NY ILY single, is built atop a delirious, translucent organ line. Unlike many of her songs, which deal in winking self-subjugation, Winnies is about a blooming sense of self-determination, and Meth smartly plays it as something that could disappear at any moment.At a recent show at London’s Theatreship, a cabaret theatre on a boat in Canary Wharf, Meth previewed new songs that alternated between amenable folk music in the style of Julia Jacklin and Angel Olsen, and shimmery, skew whiff pop songs that she sang over a prerecorded track. The modes proved surprisingly complementary – indie music ego and id, maybe, or a real-time battle between extroversion and introversion. The new songs were indelible and exciting: memorable odes to growing up, and falling in and out of love, that stand out in a crowded field of indie-pop newcomers.Shaad D’SouzaThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenDebby Friday.Photograph: Lucy Mahoney/JuliArtFlashDebby Friday – Bet on Me“Scared of what just might happen / If I go ahead and bet on me,” the Canadian pop star exhales over anxious breakbeats, building to a cheerleader chant riotous with self-belief.LSGalya Bisengalieva – Alash-kala (The Bug Reflection)From a new EP also featuring an ambient reinterpretation by KMRU, this remix of Alash-kala sees Kevin “The Bug” Martin blow the Kazakh-British composer’s lonely, glacial crackle up to an end-of-days cataclysm.LSDanny L Harle & PinkPantheress – StarlightHarle is a hard dance revivalist and a pop producer for Caroline Polachek and Dua Lipa, and both impulses cohere on this soft-donk stomper with Grimes-ish vocals from PinkPantheress.BBTAgriculture – BodhidharmaAnyone lamentingthe loss of Black Sabbaththis week should turn to this crushing post-metal anthem, with a splendid sky-scorching riff as well as eerie sound design and quiet-loud thrills.BBTGeese – TaxesAfter frontman Cameron Winter becamean indie darlingthanks to his classic solo debut Heavy Metal, Geese return with a winner: a rumpled slacker tune that straightens up and sticks out its chest for a joyful chorus.BBTSJ – OzilWith cool, softly swinging jazz obliterated by the arrival of a hard-headed drill beat, the Tottenham MC sprinkles references to his footballing past with the nimbleness of a boy-wonder midfielder.

Across its 11 tracks of , tempos rarely exceed 100bpm, wallowing in tranquil bass lines and languorous grooves. The group establish a confident and comforting tone, playing through the lullaby vocal harmonies of Never Lost, the slowed guitar of Closer to Me and Rhodes piano reverberations on My Father in Heaven.There are shades of difference: the second half of the Afrobeat-influenced Sweetie brings in interweaving horn solos from trumpeter Sheila Maurice-Grey and trombonist Anoushka Nanguy, finding brief moments of lively counterpoint before dissolving into silence. Idea 5 veers into sultry R&B thanks to featured vocalist Lulu, and Da Du Dah plays like a sun-kissed piece of 80s Brit funk.These are engaging side steps, yet they fail to fully break free from the placid Kokoroko soundworld. Tuff Times can feel all too soft and tender, with any moments of difference swallowed by dynamic similarities. It’s ideal for anyone wanting to tune in and clock out, but lacks the brave burst of energy to really grab your attention.Explore more on these topicsJazzreviewsShareReuse this content"

Phase Space is the latest expression of this interest, a project rooted in generative electronics and real-time responses.View image in fullscreenPhase Space: Degrees of FreedomDegrees of Freedom is Spearing’s first outing under this new alias: an EP of meandering ambient tracks that blur the lines between electronic and acoustic as instruments are sampled, warped and overdubbed through her synthesiser. On the subaquatic opening track Sync,cowbells are stretched and delayed beyond recognitionagainst a pulsing analogue rhythm. Towards the end of Some Pluck, a dense shimmeralmost sounds like steel pans, but you get the impression it’s something more elusive.Her improvisatory approach is the core of this album. Time signatures are varied and sounds are layered randomly by control circuits while Spearing tinkers along. What could just be friendly easy listening material is tipped off-kilter by these strange elements – and is all the better for it. Generator I, as uncanny as it is beautiful – much in the way that Mica Levi’s film scores are – is where this approach shines most. The deep, woozy melody is enough to induce a dream-like state, but instead keys tumble around it. On Sleep Pressure, a self-styled “lullaby for grownups”, the soporific sequence is unsettled by the faint clatter of metal, which has the same soft dissonance of wind chimes, delicate but jarring.Even closer Generator II, the record’s most straight-up atmospheric composition, is flecked with subtle fuzzy glitches. It’s a lovely, drifting listen with just the right amount of curiosity and texture to keep you locked in.Also out this monthPool Jamsis the latest record by the Berlin duoINIT, made up of Nadia D’Alò and Benedikt Frey (R.i.O). As the name suggests, there’s a summer sensibility here, but only in the most feverish sense: think smoky vocals, sluggish grooves and clouds of synths – hypnotic music for hot, late nights. OnOpenness Trio, guitarist and producerNate Mercereau, saxophonistJosh Johnsonand percussionistCarlos Niñojoin forces to create a collection of compositions that are as expansive and beguiling as the California hills and canyons they were recorded in (Blue Note). Another great collaborative effort comes from Brazilian sound artistsAnelena TokuandCarla Boregas(Other People). Marking a decade of their multidisciplinary project of the same name, Fronte Violeta is both soothing and ghostly. Across the 10 tracks, soft, droning electronics are interlaced with whining vocals and samples of found natural objects including branches and feathers.Explore more on these topicsMusicExperimental album of the monthExperimental musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Writers who have taken this fictional challenge, including Robert A Heinlein and Brian Aldiss, have assumed civilisational breakdowns would result, with the survivors coming to believe their ship is the only world there ever was. The author of this brilliant, character-driven debut novel has taken a more optimistic view. On Earthworld, success was measured in terms of expansion and exploitation, but on Shipworld, survival depends on preservation, recycling and austerity. During 360 years of travel to planet HD-40307g, the descendants of the original 600 pioneers never lose sight of the distant goal, along the way meeting unexpected challenges, setbacks and tragedies, but also innovations, insights and moments of joy. It’s an imaginative journey that’s absorbing, thoughtful and deeply humane.View image in fullscreenOne Yellow Eyeby Leigh Radford(Tor, £22)In a post-zombie pandemic London, Kesta is a scientist working on a project dedicated to finding a vaccine against the virus that turned so many into bloodthirsty monsters. She is especially driven because her husband, Tim, was one of the last people to be infected. But unknown to anyone else, Tim is still alive: tied to a bed in Kesta’s flat, drugged into docility while she tries everything she can think of to cure him. There’s enough real science behind the theories of how the disease works to make for a fresh and convincing take on the zombie theme, but this debut novel is especially strong as a gripping, sometimes darkly funny depiction of the grotesque lengths to which love might drive someone in refusing to accept an inevitable end.View image in fullscreenI Who Have Never Known Menby Jacqueline Harpman, translated by Ros Schwartz (Vintage, £16.99)Originally published in French in 1995, this short, mysterious novel has recently gained a wide and ardent readership, leading to this new edition. Forty women are kept in a cage underground, where the light and temperature never vary, and time is hard to measure. A changing team of three male guards enforce the rules – no talking to the guards, no physical contact between the prisoners – and provide the bare essentials of food, water and clothing. The nameless narrator is the youngest, called “Child” by the others, and has no memories of life before the cage; the older women remember families, lovers, work and home life but not how or why they were imprisoned. When they finally have the chance to escape, they emerge into a strange, barren landscape. Are they on Earth, after a nuclear holocaust, or transported to another world? They wander, gather supplies and build new homes. Readers expecting answers may be disappointed. There are a few suggestive clues, but the narrator’s experiences and reflections are more than enough to make this a strangely haunting and memorable tale.View image in fullscreenThe Reaperby Jackson P Brown(Del Rey, £16.99)Amy is a young Londoner whose empathic powers, inherited through her Jamaican grandmother, enable her not only to feel the emotions of others, but to recognise the auras of beings who come out at night: vampires, werewolves, wraiths, witches and mages. She encounters the “Grim Reaper” – Gerald, a handsome young man with skeletal, death-dealing hands who works as an assassin for hire. Amy is so tempted by the chance to learn more about the Downers (so-called because their world is “downstairs” from London) that she agrees to team up with Gerald and use her powers to track down his victims. The logic behind this unlikely empath-assassin partnership is shaky, and while contemporary London is vividly evoked, the Downer world is made up of too many hand-me-downs from other urban fantasies. Yet Gerald and Amy are interestingly complex characters, and with the slow growth of their tentative relationship this is an engaging and promising debut.Explore more on these topicsScience fiction booksScience fiction roundupHorror booksFantasy booksFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

I made my mum take it out of the library over and over again. It was about a quest for a flower with some special powers. I wish I could remember why it had such a hold over me.My favourite book growing upI think a sense of humour is forged in childhood and I remember crying with laughter as my older sister read me the Jennings books by Anthony Buckeridge. It didn’t bother me that they were all about prep school boys – it was the comedy of embarrassment that really spoke to me.The book that changed me as a teenagerI grew up during the Thatcher years. The brutal hardship of the life of 19th-century coal miners in Émile Zola’sGerminal,which I read when I’d just left school, rattled me out of my comfortable middle-class certainties in a way that the social injustices happening under my nose had failed to do. That’s the power of fiction.The book that made me want to be a writerI think I always wanted to be a writer, butThe Bellby Iris Murdoch, about a lay religious community whose peaceful, unworldly exterior hides turbulent and destructive forces, was a landmark in my reading. I read it at 16 and it was perhaps the first time I realised that a novel, if perfectly executed, could be about absolutely anything.The bookI came back toI first read Virginia Woolf’sMrs Dallowayat university and found the constant shifting from one consciousness to another infuriating and tedious. I tried it again in my 50s, closer to the age of Clarissa Dalloway herself, and this time the ripples of thoughts and impressions and the intrusion of the past into the present made much more sense. Maybe in another 40 years I will find something to admire in The Waves.The book I rereadWhen I was young,Persuasionwas my least favourite Austen novel. It was too slow, too melancholy, its hero and heroine too lacking in charisma. Each time I’ve reread it since it moves up the rankings. It doesn’t have the dazzle of Pride and Prejudice, but I have grown into its autumnal tone of regret for lost time.The book I could never read againI readLe Grand Meaulnesat 17 and thought it must have been written especially for me. Alain-Fournier’s early death on the Somme only added to its tragic allure. It’s a young person’s book, full of romance and yearning, and should not be revisited in cynical middle age. I tried and soon regretted it – “the lost domain” was well and truly lost.The book I discovered later in lifeI was in my 50s when I first read Anthony Trollope. I don’t know what took me so long as his novels have all the elements I enjoy – psychological acuity, plot, moral dilemmas, wit, social commentary. My favourite isThe Small House at Allington. Lily Dale is a delightful heroine in the Lizzie Bennet mould, but Trollope sets up the traditional good suitor/bad suitor predicament and then drives an elegant carriage and horses through our assumptions. I should add that Timothy West’s masterful performances of the unabridged audiobooks take the reading experience to an even higher level.The book I am currently readingNow We Shall Be Entirely Freeby Andrew Miller. I’m ashamed to say I had not read any of his books until The Land in Winter, which made me urgently seek out his earlier work. It’s that  rarest of treats – propulsive storytelling in sensuous prose.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Their sound was a pugilistic update of classic 60s soul, topped with frontman Kevin Rowland’s extraordinary vocals, impassioned to the point that he permanently sounded on the verge of tears. It was fervent and a little retro, perfect for a musical climate in which mod and ska revivals were already bubbling. But Dexys’ image threw a spanner in the works. “I wore a white 1930s shirt and big baggy light-grey trousers tucked into white football socks just below the knee to give the effect of ‘plus fours’,” writes Rowland of a typical outfit. “I wore pink Mary Jane ballet shoes and my hair swept back, Valentino style.”Other members appear on stage clad in jodhpurs and satin harem pants. The disparity between how they sound and how they look is so disconcerting, even their manager seems baffled. After a gig supportingthe Specials, at which their appearance so enrages the crowd that the band have to be locked in a dressing room (“for our own safety”), they tone things down completely and begin taking to the stage in donkey jackets and mariner-style beanie hats.Within months, they’re at No 1 with Geno, both one of pop’s great hymns to itself and a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy: a moving exploration of the galvanising effect music can have on a young mind that sounded tough enough to guarantee youth club dancefloors were flooded with teenage boys the second its horn riff kicked in. But Rowland is disappointed: he hankers after the days of ballet shoes and harem pants. “As a result of that decision to change our look,” he writes, “I feel we missed the opportunity to become the most culturally significant and coolest group of the 1980s … I’ve tortured myself about it over the years.”This is a book you occasionally read in a state of dread – oh God, what’s he going to do next?As the reader of Bless Me Father swiftly realises, this is a characteristic response: Rowland really doesn’t appear to have enjoyed being the mastermind of Dexys Midnight Runners at all during their 80s heyday. There were some standard problems: poor management, terrible contracts and intra-band turbulence (someone is always mutinying against Rowland’s autocratic leadership). But there’s also the sense that Rowland was hellbent on snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. The success of the 1982 single Come on Eileen – a transatlantic No 1 – is marred by his belief that he’s stolen its soul-meets-Irish-folk sound from a former Dexys member’s new band. When their ambitious next album, Don’t Stand Me Down, fails commercially, Rowland seems utterly crushed, baffled that the public who happily ta-loo-rye-ayed along to Come on Eileen can’t stomach 12-minute songs replete with spoken-word dialogue, lyrics that explore Anglo-Irish politics and indeed the band’s new clean-cut Ivy League image. He descends into a ruinous cocaine addiction, which is recounted in harrowing detail. By the early 90s, he’s effectively squatting in a bedsit: unable to pay his rent, his landlord has turned off the electricity and gas.The root of Rowland’s problems appears to lie in his background. The youngest son of an Irish immigrant family, his labourer father seems to have decided he was trouble virtually the minute he was born, for reasons that aren’t entirely clear. Rowland initially tries to please, but when that fails, sets about living up to the billing. Insecurity plays out as screw-you aggression: compulsively thieving and fighting, he is a regular fixture in the juvenile courts. It makes for a picaresque story, albeit one that you occasionally read in a state of dread – oh God, what’s he going to do next? – and Rowland tells it with an impressive lack of self-pity. Quite the opposite. Before, during and after Dexys’ success, Rowland’s tone is almost self-lacerating, filled with apologies directed at everyone from the girlfriend he gets pregnant, then abandons (he meets his daughter for the first time when she is 17) to David Bowie (who offers Dexys a support slot, only for Rowland to call him “a poor man’s Bryan Ferry” on stage). “I was,” he offers flatly at one point, “such a dick.”If anything, the reader could do with hearing more about what Rowland got right: the actual music Dexys released is almost uniformly magnificent, but here it often feels a little overshadowed, drowned out by the ructions surrounding its making, or by the author’s nagging sense of “what if?” But Bless Me Father is still powerful and oddly persuasive. Even as he seems to despair of himself, you wind up rooting for Rowland, never more so than when he conquers his addictions and releases his 1999 comeback album, My Beauty. A collection of cover versions, he promotes it while exploring his “feminine side”, in makeup, dresses and heels. The incredulity and hostility this provokes makes for sobering reading: a useful corrective to the current wave of rosy-hued 90s nostalgia. The album itself was reissued in 2020 to widespread acclaim, part of a fresh, if intermittent, wave of Dexys activity that sober and reflective Rowland seems less minded to find fault with: he ends Bless Me Father as content as you expect he’s ever going to be.Bless Me Father by Kevin Rowland is published by Ebury Spotlight (£25).

The second that Ace of Spades comes on over a montage of skaters on the title screen, I am forcefully yanked back to the early 00s, when I spent untold hours playing one Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater game or another in the gross bedrooms of my teen-boy friends. More than 20 years later, I can almost smell the acrid lingering odour of Lynx body spray.In 2020, the first couple of Tony Hawk’s games were polished up and re-released as the first wave of Y2K nostalgia hit. The two games were packaged up as one, with consistent controls and a new look that preserved the grungy feel of the originals, and the same is true for 3+4: levels, skaters and parks from both 2001’s THPS3 and 2002’s THPS4 rock up here alongside newer stars of the sport (including Riley Hawk, son of the eponymous skating celebrity – I found this oddly touching).View image in fullscreen‘You can string together insane and risky combos.’Photograph: ActivisionI remember these places so well – the factory, the college campus, the snow-dusted Canadian skate park, the time capsule of central London. Weirdly, the zoo level is now empty of animals (why?), but otherwise these compact arrangements of grindable, trickable urban obstacle courses are very much as they were. (The skater-punk soundtrack, unfortunately, isnotas it was – there are a great many omissions, a disappointment only partly softened by a slew of new tracks.) Between grabs, spins, flips and manuals you can string together insane and risky combos across their entire geography, skidding across power lines, along walls and finding hidden half-pipes.Watch a trailer for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4I donotremember all of this being so hard, however. My first few hours with these games were a humiliation, as I grappled with the controller and baled over and over again trying to meet even the minimum required scores in each two-minute run. Was I always this bad at these games? Whatever muscle memory I once had is gone, but I am slowly building up a respectable set of virtual-skating skills again. There are more complex moves and traversal tricks to keep in mind here than there were in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2, which is a more arcadey experience, and a better place to start if you weren’t there for these games the first time round.Like the real sport, it’s about perseverance and repetition: when the combos started to flow again for me after a few hours, it felt sofreeing. I still don’t think there’s a better skating game out there than old-school Tony Hawk’s, even after all this time – and there’s certainly no better time capsule of this pivotal moment in the history of the sport.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 is out July 11; £39.99Explore more on these topicsGamesSports gamesSkateboardingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Bands including Less Than Jake, the Ataris and AFI pay tribute to a gaming megastar who loves them backTom ReganFri 11 Jul 2025 05.40 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 19.22 EDTShareWhen millions of parents bought their kids a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater game in the late 90s and early 00s, they couldn’t have understood the profound effect it would have on their children’s music taste. With bands from Bad Religion to Papa Roach and Millencolin accompanying every failed spin and grind, these trick-tastic games slyly doubled up as the ultimate compilation CD.While the Fifa games have an equally storied history with licensed music, those soundtracks feel impersonal – a who’s who of whichever artists EA’s associated record labels wanted to push at the time. Pro Skater’s soundtrack, by contrast, felt like being handed a grubby and slightly dog-eared handmade mixtape, still battered from its last tumble at the local skate park.“Most of the bands were chosen because I heard them growing up at the skate park. I would say most of the original punk stuff – even the early hip-hop – that was my soundtrack to skating in the 80s and 90s,” Tony Hawk says. “I never imagined that I would be a tastemaker but, that was really just a byproduct of staying true to the culture.”“Tony was very involved in punk rock,” says Chris DeMakes, frontman of Less Than Jake, before his set at this year’s Slam Dunk festival. “Ultimately, he had to approve the bands on his soundtrack … So that always kind of made me feel good about it.” The band’s Roger Lima adds: “The culture of skating and music is so meshed, it made sense for them to have a real soundtrack to it.”For the bands that made it on to these games in those years, the impact was immeasurable. “I remember playing earlier versions of THPS and hearing some of our contemporaries … I hoped we’d get an opportunity like that,” says Hunter Burgan, bassist of AFI. “But I don’t think I really understood how big the impact was until after we actuallywereon the soundtrack. I can’t tell you how many people have come up to me over the last two decades and told me that THPS3 was their first introduction to AFI.”View image in fullscreen‘Tony had to approve the bands on his soundtrack so that made me feel good about it’ … Less Than Jake.Photograph: Piers Allardyce/Rex/Shutterstock“Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater made All My Best Friends Are Metalheads a hit – as big a hit as if we would have been on 60 major rock stations in America … Probablybigger,” says DeMakes. “I talked to John Feldman [of Goldfinger] about this recently, and with Superman it’s the same thing for them. That wasn’t a worldwide hit, but itbecamea hit for them because of that game.”When the original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater came out in 1999, those grey PlayStation discs served as a punk rock Trojan horse, sneaking a killer introduction to the world of alt and punk music to millions of unsuspecting kids. A quarter-century later, new artists are featuring on modern remakes of the Pro Skater games, alongside the bands that shaped their taste.“Those games fully altered my taste in music!” says Sammy Ciaramitaro, vocalist of hardcore band Drain. “They brought punk rock (and a lot of other incredible music) to my childhood bedroom.” Drain are now one of a handful of new artists that were chosen to be added to the soundtrack for the remakes.“I think our inclusion represents the growth of hardcore,” says Ciaramitaro. “I’m honored that we now get to be a part of this with Turnstile and End It, too. I hope that maybe some young kids will hear our songs while playing and it will motivate them to do a deep dive into punk rock music, like we all did when we were younger.”Other bands who weren’t quite big enough to get on Tony’s radar at the time, such as the Ataris, spent their careers dreaming of making it on to the next Pro Skater game. “We were coming of age the same time that Pro Skater was,” says bassist Mike Davenport. “In 1999/2000 was when we really started to take off as a band and we didn’t even feel as if we belonged with the bands that were featured [on the games].” The Ataris’ track All Souls’ Day eventually made the soundtrack for 2020’s Pro Skater 1+2 remake.Davenport says that the band used to play Pro Skater constantly on tour in the back of an RV – even, once, in the middle of a car accident. “My merch guy and I were playing in the kitchen nook one night when we heard the driver yell ‘look out!’ and then the TV flew at us, and we both literally batted it down with our hands so as not to have it smash us in the face,” he remembers. “Sadly the TV and PlayStation were killed, but luckily not us.”View image in fullscreenDavey Havok performing with AFI in 2007.Photograph: Reuters/AlamyEven though Less Than Jake reaped the rewards of being on the game back in 2002, returning with a different song on the Pro Skater remake decades later still felt like a badge of honour: “We’re a band that’s been around for 33 years, so we love anything that can propel us and get us in front of a new audience,” says DeMakes, “Everybody has social media. Anybody can upload their song to YouTube or Spotify or Apple Music now, it’s a different playing field. So how do you get noticed? Getting asked to be in a video game is perfect.”“As long as there are people playing video games there will be an avenue to connect them with music,” says Burgan, “Skateboarding, punk rock and video games were a huge part of our lives growing up and were inextricably connected, so it seems like a natural continuation of that. For bands, I think the cultural impact is far more important and lasting than any financial benefit.”Such is the lasting impact of the Pro Skater soundtracks that there are cover bands dedicated to playing it live – among them the 900. “We were really annoying when we first started the band, just tagging Tony Hawk in every story and Instagram post,” frontman Harry Shaw tells me. “When he followed us [on social media] we thought: ‘That’s it, we’ve made it.’ We never imagined that he’d actually come on stage with us.”In a video that’s since gone viral on Instagram,Tony Hawk hopped on stage unannouncedwith the 900 in east London, covering Bloodstains by Agent Orange and Superman by Goldfinger, to a rapturous crowd. “[We’re] eternally grateful for him doing that show, and also just not being a dick about bands covering songs from his game, either,” says Shaw, “He doesn’t have to do this stuff, his name is so big within pop culture – like Ronaldo or Messi – he’s almost like a living meme.”View image in fullscreen‘I can’t sing every song’ … Tony Hawk on stage with the 900 in London in 2022.Photograph: Doug Young“There are five bands that only play covers from our video game series, and I’ve sang with three of them. But that one [the 900] was really fun,” says Hawk. “My appearance was a surprise, and they were kind enough to choose songs that I was more into. Yes, I’m proud of the soundtrack, but I can’t sing every song nor could I remember the lyrics!”In the decades that have passed since the original Pro Skater games, their soundtracks have been the gift that keeps giving for the bands who make it on. “I actually just met Tony a few weeks ago at a music festival,” says AFI’s Burgan. “He is a true music lover and that makes being included in THPS even more special.”While Pro Skater has gone down in legend, Less Than Jake believes that it could have very easily gone the other way.“How many stars do we know that have made products or endorsed things that weren’t good?” laughs DeMakes. “But in Tony’s case, he had a really cool game that kids embraced and loved.”“Pro Skater could have been a flop, it could have just not really worked out in the long run,” agrees Lima. “But every element of it was just super effortlessly cool and it was huge for us … I can’t count the amount of times someone has said: “I found out about you guys through Pro Skater.” Just look at the YouTube comments … thousands and thousands of fans that probably never would have heard of us otherwise.”Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 is out nowExplore more on these topicsGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Just eyes – heavy and charcoal-drawn – staring in stillness and silence. They don’t accuse. They don’t beg. They simply watch. Peering out of pale, formless faces – a quiet demand to acknowledge their very existence.This is Gazans’ View of the World, a stark monochrome piece by Palestinian artist Nabil Abughanima, one of more than 50 works now on display at Metamorphika Studio in Hackney, London. Together, they formDlúthpháirtíocht– the Irish word for “solidarity” – an exhibition that spans continents, memories and borders, binding Palestinian and Irish histories into a single frame.Born from a poem written by co-curator Seán Óg Ó Murchú in response to the war in Gaza, he describes the exhibition as “the world’s largest international exhibition of contemporary Irish artists” – while providing a safe refuge for the work of Palestinian artists living in exile.Here, the art is not ornamental; it is urgent. Some artists fled Gaza only months ago, while the show itself is itinerant – travelling to Dublin, Cork and Belfast after its London leg ends on 19 July.Among those featured is Abughanima himself, who left Gaza two months ago and now lives in France.“Before the most recent war, I gathered a team of young artists and began building what we hoped would be Gaza’s first independent animation studio,” he says. “I rented a space, equipped it and watched the dream take its first real form. Then the war came. And it took everything.”View image in fullscreen‘The contrast [between Israel and Gaza] is extraordinary’ … a photograph by Seamus Murphy.Photograph: Seamus MurphyHis work wrestles with myth and ancestral stories being under siege. “If those stories are lost,” he says, “the very values upon which global society claims to stand will be lost too.”As you enter the gallery, you are immediately confronted by the works of the acclaimed Irish photographer Seamus Murphy. Though he’s spent over three decades documenting war and migration across the globe, it is his time in Gaza and the West Bank in the mid-2000s that stays with him.One photograph, grainy and dim, captures a group of men among barbed wire fencing, staring down a checkpoint. “It was five in the morning on a Sunday,” Murphy recalls. “I walked with them from their towns, they prayed on the way, before they queued at the crossing. Some were allowed into Israel for work. Many were turned back.“You cannot escape it, when you cross into Israel from Gaza, the contrast is extraordinary: you have unbelievable social chaos and poverty … and then manicured roads and advanced technology. It’s a vivid image of how people are treated under occupation.”Not all the works at the exhibit are realist. Upstairs, at the far end of the room, surrealism replaces reportage. Flying People is a dreamlike canvas by Palestinian artist Amal Al Nakhala who was forced to move from Gaza with her family to Cairo. The piece shows people in the sky, upside down. Below are jagged teeth.Al Nakhala says she “played with symbolism, where the people on the ground become the war plane”, flipping the world on its axis.Her work is not a literal depiction of the war, she says, but an attempt to capture its absurd repetition: “It shows how occupation becomes the norm, and death becomes normalised.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Across it, scrawled in Arabic, are the words “I’m afraid of the dark”. It is a collaboration between Irish artist Spicebag and Scottish artist Council Baby, a stark tribute to five-year-oldHind Rajab, killed by Israeli forces in January 2024 after being stranded in Gaza City in a car with her family. For hours, she pleaded for help over the phone while family members and paramedics lay dead beside her.An investigationfound the car she was in had 335 bullet holes in the car’s exterior.“She stands out,” says Spicebag. “Among so many faceless dead children, there’s a common touch point there, with the emergency call and the desperation in her voice. It’s visceral and horrifying.”For many Irish artists, the connection betweenIrelandand Palestine transcends borders. “There’s nothing in recent Irish history comparable to the scale of destruction in Gaza,” Spicebag says, “but when you see armoured vehicles on residential streets – not there to protect you but to suppress you … it’s buried deep in our psyche.”But this isn’t just symbolic, or a passive act of watching from afar.All proceeds go toDignity for Palestinians, a charity founded by Dr Musallam Abukhalil which provides food, water and nappies to displaced families in Gaza. “The money might go to a food basket, clean water, maybe something small for a camp,” Abukhalil says. “It’s that direct. Art is resistance in Gaza, it always has been.”And sometimes resistance looks like two children, huddled over a slice of bread with Nutella. “There’s a video,” Spicebag says of a clip sent to him from Dignity for Palestine. “These two little girls, eating from one of the food parcels.

Her laugh-packed sets, served with snacks and a warm conversational style, are inspired by the standup ofCaroline Aherne. “I like it to feel as if I’m talking to a friend,” she says. Slob began as a turning-30 existential crisis about reaching your potential, but when a rare disease left McGuinness in a coma, everything shifted. She will share the “bizarre and surreal” experience of coma-induced delirium, tender reflections on “the sweetness of the nurses” that cared for her, and a blossoming love story. “A lot of people feel like a slob, but we’re doing the best we can,” she says.Monkey Barrel, 28 July–24 AugustSimple TownUS group Simple Town make consistently brilliant short films, where everyday conundrums (what’s the meaning of “adroit”? What happens if you’re late for a funeral?) escalate to extremes, or descend into meta-narratives about the absurdity of online content. The foursome, who started performing regularly in New York around 2017, are bringing an hour of “pure sketch comedy” for their fringe debut. Their previous visits to the UK sold out fast. “Our work is somewhere between alternative and crowd-pleasing. Sometimes it’s brainy, ‘comedian’s comedian’ humour, but we also work very hard for the shows to be silly, broad, fast-paced, and fun,” they say. “So hopefully, both kinds of audiences will find something in the show to hate.”Pleasance Courtyard, 11–24 AugustView image in fullscreenJessica Barton in Dirty Work.Photograph: Paul WestbrookDirty WorkAustralian performer Jessica Barton started out in musical theatre and got her first taste of comedy at French clown school Gaulier. She began to “play using song and movement, physical comedy and clowning”, moved to London and immersed herself in its alternative comedy scene. Dirty Work combines her vocal talents with playful audience interaction. In character as Floppins – a Mary Poppins-esque figure intent on cleaning up the stage – she cleverly explores gendered domestic roles. “Expect to have a lot of fun,” she says. “Expect to be challenged and to rise to the occasion. Especially the men in the audience.” Dirty Work was awarded best newcomer at Melbourne international comedy festival and as she gets deeper into the character: “I’ve enjoyed finding new things within the world I’ve created.”Underbelly Cowgate, 31 July–24 AugustAyoade Bamgboye: Swings and RoundaboutsHer assured presence and sideways perspective make Ayoade Bamgboye stand out on any lineup, despite having only three years of live comedy under her belt. She had been working as a writer when someone suggested she try it and Bamgboye is always experimenting, incorporating clowning, multimedia forays and different personae into her performances. She “grew up between London and Lagos” and gives a unique twist on observational comedy: “I’m looking at everything as if I’m on safari. I’m a curious silly billy.” Bamgboye says her comedy has sometimes been “confrontational and caustic” with spicy punchlines on racism and colonialism, but with her debut she’s ready to be more vulnerable, too: “Audiences should expect something bittersweet.”Pleasance Courtyard, 30 July–24 AugustView image in fullscreenSharon Wanjohi: In the House.Photograph: Rebecca NeedmenearSharon Wanjohi: In the HouseShe first tried standup at university in Southampton (“We had a comedy society where all the nerds went”) and quickly racked up finalist spots at the Funny Women and BBC new comedy awards. Now, Sharon Wanjohi is making her fringe debut with a show about self-help culture and the zeitgeisty coping mechanisms that are “shoved down our throats” every day. “I’m presenting myself as this 90s talkshow host, in the mould of Trisha and Oprah”, Wanjohi says. “I’m satirising self-help, but also breaking out of character to do standup.” You’ll get a gen Z spin on societal issues like the housing crisis, but something “goofy, silly, less grounded in reality,” Wanjohi promises.Pleasance Courtyard, 30 July–24 AugustRoger O’Sullivan: FekkenThis 90s-tinted debut from Irish comedian Roger O’Sullivan explores his relationship with his farmer father via Tekken and the rest of young Roger’s favourite PlayStation games. He started out on Cork’s small comedy scene eight years ago, where “there weren’t really any stakes, so any gig you’d do something new and try the weirdest thing. That’s the mentality I’ve had from early on.” He’s had success online with lo-fi animations, which he works into the show to great effect. “I wanted to end with a callback to retro video games and thought it would be really funny if I learned 3D animation just for that.” Expect warm standup that melds “a little bit of heart with absurdism”.Hoots @ The Apex, 2–23 AugustExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalFestivalsTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Singles compilation Time Flies… 1994–2009 is No 1 for the first time since it was released in June 2010. Their second album, 1995’s (What’s the Story) Morning Glory? rises 12 places to No 2, and their 1994 debut album Definitely Maybe jumps 22 spots to No 4.In the singles chart, Acquiesce – originally the B-side to their first No 1 single, 1995’s Some Might Say, peaks at No 17 after making its stand-alone chart debut at No 40 last week.Oasis review – a shameless trip back to the 90s for Britpop’s loudest, greatest songsRead moreAcquiesce is the second song performed in full on their current tour set list, after the instrumental introduction Fuckin’ in the Bushes and Hello. With the lyrics “Because we need one another / We believe in one another”, it has been adopted by fans as an anthem of fraternal love between Liam and Noel Gallagher, despite Noel disagreeing with the interpretation.The 1996 No 1 single Don’t Look Back in Anger reaches No 18, though hasn’t yet surpassed its most recent peak of No 9 last September, soon after the reunion was announced.It also spent seven weeks in the chart in 2017 after being adopted as the unofficial anthem of Manchester in the wake of the terrorist attack on an Ariana Grande concert in the city that May. WhenOasisperform the song on the current tour, the stage visuals feature yellow bumblebees in tribute to the city’s worker bee symbol.Live Forever, which also lingered on the chart in the wake of the reunion news, rises to No 19.‘This is what I’ve lived my life to do’: Oasis fans head to ManchesterRead moreAfter two nights in Cardiff last weekend, Oasis are set to perform five nights at Heaton Park in Manchester from tonight (11 July). Temperatures are expected to reach 31C on night one, prompting organisers to share a weather warning for the first outdoor show of the tour. Rules on bringing bottles into the ground have been relaxed, with ticketholders now permitted to carry 500ml of water in a sealed bottle and up to 200ml of sun cream.Oasis posted: “Wear a (bucket) hat. Where possible stay in shade. Look after yourself and look after each other.”Fans without tickets have beenwarned against attempting to get infor the sold-out shows after TikTok users claimed you could enter the park by swimming.As in Cardiff last weekend, the city has beenoverrun by international visitors, with pubs, shops and even tattoo parlours reporting an uptick in business, while Liam Gallagher has voiced new announcements for the tram route that will take fans to the gig.It is unlikely that fans will be disappointed: the first night of Cardiff earnedunilateral five-star reviews in the British press.

As relations ice over again, what can we learn from this artistic detente?Simon UsborneFri 11 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareOne of the biggest TV hits of the 1960s was Double Your Money, a  kind of low-fi precursor to Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. Its presenter, Hughie Green, was a titan of family entertainment who drew audiences of more than 8 million to the ITV gameshow, in which contestants chose whether to double their prize pot between questions.It was, of course, all about the cash, even if TV-rich in those days involved maximum winnings of £1,000 (about £18,000 in today’s money). The show’s baked-in avarice made the entry in the TV Times for 7pm on 8 November 1966 surprising: “Double Your Money visits Moscow with People to People … the first ever western quiz game in the Soviet Union.”For two consecutive Tuesdays, millions of Britons watched Green and his sidekick Monica Rose present a heavily adapted version of the show from a rudimentary studio in the House of Friendship, a mock-Moorish castle near the Kremlin that served as a theatre for communist propaganda.Subtitled “People to People” in the listings, the show was renamed “Do You Want to Go On?” in Moscow. Money did not feature. Instead contestants competed for points, which could be exchanged for state-made goodies such as toasters and televisions.View image in fullscreen‘But what impressed me most was the excitement and enthusiasm of the audience’ … Hughie Green and Monica Rose on Double Your Money.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThe recordings were beset with technical difficulties. Lights went out, speakers failed. “But what impressed me most was the excitement and enthusiasm of the audience,”recalled show producer Bill Costello in 2018. “To them the show was unusual, different and original and they really got carried away by the competitive spirit.”Viewed from today, the export of a British cash-prize gameshow to Moscow seems fanciful, not least given the current state of relations betweenRussiaand the west. Yet they were in keeping with a wider tradition of cold war cultural exchanges from 1955 until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. This soft-power tit-for-tat involved the shipping of entire ballet, opera and theatre companies as respective governments, and a string of impresarios, swept back the iron curtain to reveal the best each side had to offer.The cultural contest was instigated in Moscow after the death of Stalin in 1953. His successors quickly set about softening relations with the west. “They needed to open up, but they wanted to open up in a kind of controlled way,” says Sarah Davies, a history professor at Durham University, who is working on a book about these exchanges.View image in fullscreen‘Everything was exotic’ … The Moiseyev Dance Company.Photograph: University of Southern California/Corbis/Getty ImagesWithin weeks of Stalin’s fatal stroke, Lilian Hochhauser, a London impresario with Russian heritage, began to shuttle top dancers and musicians between the countries, including Mstislav Rostropovich, Dmitri Shostakovich and Benjamin Britten. Hochauser, who is now 98, said in 2019 that a mutual cultural appetite that had flourished during the Anglo-Soviet allyship in the second world war had only grown under Stalin. “Everybody wanted to see the folk-dance companies from the Ukraine, the Moiseyev Dance Company,”she told the Times.“Everything was exotic. Because it had been such a closed book for so long.”London initially feared the propaganda potential in such swaps and used the British Council to exert its own control. The first sanctioned visit arranged under its auspices came in 1955 when the 30-year-old director Peter Brook took Hamlet to Moscow, with Paul Scofield in the leading role. It was doubly symbolic; Stalin had hated Hamlet. “It had almost been taboo,” Davies says of the play.The Soviet regime also sought legitimacy in the patronage of such heavyweights as Scofield, Britten and even Hughie Green. Stars would be given tours of key Soviet sites, captured by news crews whose films could be narrated as each side saw fit. “How do they live, these mysterious human beings, once our wartime allies but always an unknown quantity to us,” a narrator says in clipped English over a 1965Pathé news filmof Olivier touring Moscow, where the National Theatre was staging Othello a year after the Bolshoi had visited London.By then, the risks of these exchanges had become dramatically apparent, with the defection of Rudolf Nureyev during a Kirov Ballet tour of Europe. Before that, in 1958, MI5 were caught on the hop when Michael Redgrave secretly met his old Cambridge friend and notorious double agent Guy Burgessduring another tour of Hamlet in Moscow. In an intercepted letter to his mother, Burgess said the men had enjoyed “fine gossips” and that Redgrave had been “much better than Paul Scofield” as Hamlet. But such high-profile brushes with scandal failed to close the curtain on the project, which had been formalised in 1959 with the Anglo-Soviet Cultural Agreement between the British Council and its Soviet counterpart.It wasn’t all Shakespeare and ballet. Some cultural exchanges continued to take place outside the official agreement. The British Council had no role in the Double Your Money episodes, which were hosted by MoscowTelevisionduring a relative thaw, before the Red Army crushed the 1968 Prague Spring, an attempt by Czechoslovakia to loosen Moscow’s grip. This perhaps partly explains the knockabout tone of the TV Times coverage of the enterprise. “Caviar for breakfast? Well, why not? At 7s 6d for a large dollop, it’s a fabulous buy,” wrote Dave Lanning, a columnist and ITV darts commentator, who joined Green for a tour of Moscow.In 1976, Cliff Richard became the first major western pop musician to visit Moscow. He later recalled being given an ornate tea urn in exchange for a pair of his blue jeans. To the delight of fans who had devoured bootlegged records by the Beatles et al, more big names followed in the 1980s, particularly during glasnost, Mikhail Gorbachev’s attempts to open up. Elton John made the trip. Billy Joel crowd surfed in Leningrad while draped in the American and Russian flags.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But, by 1988, James Birch, a provocative 32-year-old London art curator, spied an opportunity. He had befriended Sergei Klokov, an enterprising KGB agent, and conspired with him to put on a Francis Bacon exhibition in Moscow.Birch says the artist, whom he had known since childhood, was buzzing. “He even went out and bought himself a Walkman and learned Russian on cassette,” he says. In the end, the notoriously capricious Bacon decided not to go, but 400,000 Russians filed through the city’s Central House of Artists to see his work.Birch and Klokov teamed up again in April 1990, in the dying days of the USSR, to take Gilbert & George to Moscow. The exhibition was another hit, and open to interpretation. While looking at Coming (1983), in which the artists look up at a sky filled with flying underpants, a Russian man told Birch he thought it represented the west invading Russia, with the pants symbolising war planes or parachutes.Whether these exchanges played any significant role in hastening the demise of the Soviet Union remains a matter of debate. Davies says cultural figures who appeared through the iron curtain sometimes overestimated their influence. “It was part of this whole triumphalist narrative that the west undermined the Soviet system because we presented this better, brighter alternative, but I think a lot of scholars challenge that,” she says.View image in fullscreenBack in the USSR … Paul McCartney performing in Red Square in 2003.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThe tradition of cultural exchanges endured after the cold war, and visits continued to serve the Kremlin as an opportunity to sell its legitimacy on an international stage. In 2003, Paul McCartney performed Beatles hits in a landmark Red Square concert. Vladimir Putin, three years into his presidency, was enthusiastic. Over tea, he told McCartney the Beatles’ music had been “like a gulp of freedom … an open window to the world”. When Putin arrived halfway through the gig, McCartney played Back in the USSR, his 1968 parody of western patriotism.‘It was like a toxic relationship’: the exiled Russian musicians starting again abroadRead moreTwo decades later,Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has plunged cultural relations into a new ice age. “It reminds me of the Stalin years, when there was no contact at all,” Davies says. But she has noticed a slight softening. In September, the Russian soprano Anna Netrebko is due to perform at the Royal Opera House in London, three years after New York’s Metropolitan Opera dropped her for refusing to denounce Putin, whom she had supported (she later criticised his invasion andsued the Met).In the meantime, the battle for ideas is playing out on new stages.Godfrey Cromwell, a hereditary peer and the director of The British East-West Centre, formerly the The Great Britain-USSR Association, says the use of social media as a propaganda tool has become more important than physical exchanges. Such accounts, he says,“can deliver focused messages to far larger audiences at far less cost”.Regardless of their diplomatic potential, cultural exchanges have always opened windows to the people behind the regimes. As Bill Costello put it, decades after Double Your Money’s unlikely jolly in Moscow: “It was an incredible experience and a very human one – because underneath all the language problems and differences in culture it certainly proved to me that people are the same the world over.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDanceBalletTheatreRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 1994 he made a drastic career swerve to become principal of Lamda – the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art – and led a complete overhaul of the school’s new home, which he identified and purchased, in the former Royal Ballet School buildings on Talgarth Road; there, he re-established its top dog status alongside Rada.View image in fullscreenPeter James at the Sheffield Crucible where he brought in the lucrative World Snooker Championship in 1977, and, he said, had the happiest time of his life.Photograph: Ed YardleyA killer commercial theatre success evaded him, but his style was that of a quietly effective enabler: of students, actors, organisations and fellow artists. Right at the start of his Lyric phase, he put onDavid Hare’s important revival of Christopher Hampton’s Total Eclipse (with Hilton McRae as Rimbaud andSimon Callowas Verlaine) to an acclaim long overdue since its 1968 premiere.And in Sheffield he channelled his sporting enthusiasms – which included boxing and soccer (he was a lifelong Arsenal fan) – into pitching for, and landing, in 1977, the long-term residency of the money-spinning World Snooker Championship, which put the Crucible on the global map and reinforced its local and national profile.Modest, quietly spoken and loved by colleagues and peers alike, James sported a piratical/rock star “look” with long hair and ponytail, wide-brimmed hats, and a rare ability to roll a liquorice-papered ciggie in one hand while writing notes with the other.When invited to direct the Israeli premiere of Hair in Tel Aviv in the early 1970s, he suggested breaking the ice on the first day of rehearsals by starting with the all-nude scene at the end of the first act. He then stripped off, the actors and stage management followed (birthday) suit and the ice was not only broken but completely dissolved.Born in Enfield, north London, Peter was the son of Gladys (nee King) and Arthur James, who worked in the Enfield gun factory. He was educated at Albany secondary modern (now comprehensive), then joined the sixth form at Enfield grammar school, progressing to Birmingham University to study English and philosophy before spending 39 weeks in rep as actor and dogsbody at the Intimate, Palmer’s Green, his near-local theatre.He entered the “national” world of theatre by taking a certificate in drama at Bristol University and, in 1964, launched the Liverpool Everyman in a former Methodist chapel on Hope Street, withTerry Hands, future RSC director, and Martin Jenkins, future BBC radio drama producer.He directed more than 30 productions there as sole artistic director (1967-70). He invited Liverpool into the theatre, commissioning the poet Roger McGough and his band the Scaffold, and directing a documentary about the building of the new Roman Catholic cathedral at the end of the road. This set the tone for the following eras of the directorAlan Dossorand the playwright Willy Russell, and indeed all managements since.At the Young Vic, working with the artistic director Frank Dunlop, he directed Beckett (Denise Coffeyin Happy Days), Pinter, Shakespeare, O’Casey and a season ofTed Hughes.View image in fullscreenSimon Callow as Verlaine in David Hare’s production of Total Eclipse by Christopher Hampton at the Lyric, Hammersmith in 1981.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyThe happiest time of his life, he said, was in Sheffield – he gaveAlan Rickmanhis first leading roles, notably as a distraught pop concert sponsor in Stephen Poliakoff’s The Summer Party (1980), with Brian Cox and Hayley Mills; and as Jaques in As You Like It with Ruby Wax (1977). James also brought on the comedian and cabaret performerVictoria Woodas writer and the film directorDavid Leland. He himself directed a controversial play byKeith Dewhurstabout Northern Ireland, The Bomb in Brewery Street (1975).The Guardian critic and New Statesman writer Paul Allen, based in Sheffield, claims that James made him a better critic and, later, a better playwright (he wrote the stage version of the movie Brassed Off in 1998 and several plays with Rony Robinson), and he ended up chairing the board. James’s Sheffield “posse”, who remained close, included Allen, the designer Roger Glossop, Glossop’s wife, the stage manager Charlotte Scott, his secretary Lou Cooper and the press officer Jen Coldwell.At the Lyric, he confessed that he “never quite knew who I was talking to”. All the same, he directed fine new plays byPoliakoffandNeil Simon, the venerable farce Charley’s Aunt starring a brilliant Griff Rhys-Jones, and two musicals byCharles Strouse– an operatic Nightingale (1982) starring Sarah Brightman, and the weirdly eccentric Lyle the Crocodile (1987) – for which Strouse wrote music, book and lyrics – based on Bernard Waber’s 1962 book The House on East 88th Street.He called in his impressive international contacts to bring two great directors to the Lyric:Yuri Lyubimovwith his version of Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment (1983) led byMichael Pennington, and the actor Núria Espert with a beautiful production of Lorca’s The House of Bernarda Alba (1986) starringJoan PlowrightandGlenda Jackson, which transferred to the West End.At Lamda, James initiated courses based on the work of Mike Alfreds’ Shared Experience and Simon McBurney’s Complicité, and commissioned workshops with the playwrightMark Ravenhilland actor/director Di Trevis that led to new plays taken up byNicholas Hytnerat the National – Ravenhill’s gloriously rude Mother Clap’s Molly House and Pinter’s beautiful, unproduced screenplay of Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past (both in 2000).He left Lamda in 2010 but was coaxed out of retirement to be head of the theatre-directing graduate course at Mountview Academy in Peckham, south London, in 2012, a post he relinquished only two or three years ago. His latest theatre productions included several shows for Glossop at the 260-seater Old Laundry in Bowness-on-Windermere.In all, he was a dynamic, one-man motor and instigator for the last half century of British theatre and fully deserved being made CBE in 2011.James was married to Anthea Olive, a costume designer at the Liverpool Everyman, from 1964 to 1972, when they divorced. He was then in a relationship for 10 years from 1975 with the Irish actor Bernadette McKenna before marrying Alexandra Paisley in 1998; they divorced in 2012.He lived in Tottenham, north London, retiring finally to Truro, Cornwall, to be near his daughter, Emily, from his first marriage. Even there, in failing health, he contacted the Hall for Cornwall to enquire as to how he might advise and encourage young people entering the theatre.He is survived by Emily, by Leo, his son with McKenna, by four grandchildren, Felix, Jessica, Olivia and Lila, and by a younger sister, Margaret.Peter John James, theatre director, born 27 July 1940; died 28 June 2025Explore more on these topicsTheatreYoung VicLyric HammersmithEveryman theatreobituariesShareReuse this content"

The erstwhile Man of Steel, who played the last son of Krypton on TV in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman from 1993 to 1997, thinks James Gunn has gone too far with hisdescription of Kal-Elas an “immigrant that came from other places and populated the country” in the new DC film.Speaking to TMZ, Cain pondered: “How woke is Hollywood going to make this character? How much is Disney going to change their Snow White? Why are they going to change these characters [to] exist for the times?”Here’s the thing (and you might think Cain had picked this up given he actually played the guy)Supermanhas actually been woke since 1938. Created by two Jewish teenagers from Cleveland, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, he was a child of the Great Depression, standing up for the little guy, fighting Nazis (as well as corrupt politicians, crooked landlords and wartime saboteurs). In many ways he represented the ultimate immigrant fantasy: assimilated, adored, and just powerful enough to completely knock injustice into next week.In fact, superheroes (and more recently superhero movies) have always been the genre equivalent of a protest sign in a wind tunnel: loud, colourful, occasionally hard to read, but very much trying to say something. Captain America was literally invented to punch Nazis – the first issue of Timely Comics’ Captain America Comics #1 famously featured him socking Hitler in the jaw – months before the US officially entered the second world war. If that’s not performative virtue signalling, I’m not sure what is.View image in fullscreenVirtue signalling … Chris Evans v bad guys in Captain America: Winter Soldier.Photograph: Marvel Studios/AllstarIn 1946 (on the radio), Superman took down a thinly veiled version of the Ku Klux Klan in a 16-part storyline titled “Clan of the Fiery Cross”. The show’s writers used real-life intel from anti-racist activist Stetson Kennedy, who had infiltrated the Klan and passed on details of its secret codes and rituals. It is widely cited as one of the earliest and most effective examples of mass media activism, and certainly a lot more politically brazen than anything Gunn is planning.And yes, there might have been a brief period in the 1950s in which Cap seemed to be weirdly repositioned as Joseph McCarthy’s commie-bashing errand boy (in the comics). But that whole era was so awkwardly jingoistic thatMarveleventually retconned it entirely, blaming it all on an impostor.As superheroes transitioned to the big screen from the late 1970s onwards, the original Superman movie emerged in 1978 amid the post-Watergate, all-American desire for a hero who didn’t lie, cheat, embezzle, wiretap, bomb Cambodia, or resign in disgrace with jowls full of self-pity and a suitcase full of un-shredded indictments.By the early 00s,X-Menhad turned its spandex into a metaphor delivery system, giving us a mutant civil rights allegory so on the nose it basically came out during the opening credits. Whether it was Magneto as militant separatist, Professor X as an integrationist who uses a wheelchair, or teenagers being grilled about their DNA in suburban living rooms, this was identity politics in Lycra, with just enough laser eyes to distract from the social realism. Nobody seemed to mind a bit that Mystique changed sex at will, Rogue needed gloves to avoid unsolicited intimacy, and the whole film played like a coming-out parable in leather – because for all its subtext, X-Men still delivered the spectacle fans came for.View image in fullscreenAbout to have an epiphany … Robert Downey Jr in 2008’s Iron Man.Photograph: Marvel/AllstarAnd then of course there was the Marvel Cinematic Universe proper, kicking off with 2008’sIron Man. Here’s a movie in which Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark basically has an epiphany that building shoulder-mounted death machines for unstable warlords might not be the most ethical retirement plan – and somehow this moment of conscience becomes the bedrock of the entire MCU.

The nuance, the guilt, the faint whiff of accountability in a billion-dollar franchise. The absence of the sort of “all-American” values last seen in a deleted scene from Team America that was deemed too on-the-nose. And yet ultimately, if superheroes aren’t about subverting the powerful, sticking up for the underdogs, and punching moral cowardice squarely in the jaw, what exactly is the point?Superman review – is it a bust? Is it a pain? James Gunn’s dim reboot is bothRead moreThis is not to say that there haven’t been intriguing rightwing superheroes over the decades, though it’s rare that any of these have really ended up looking like someone you’d trust with a moral compass. Take Watchmen’s Comedian, casually blasting Vietnamese villagers like a walking nightmare of national militarism cranked to 11 and handed a flame-thrower. Or Gunn’s own Peacemaker, a cautionary tale about what happens when you mix a very dim man with a blind devotion to “peace through strength” and a fondness for ends-justify-the-means patriotism. Then there’s The Boys’ Homelander: an authoritarian, populist psychopath in stars and stripes.Of course what Cain et al would really like to see is a Superman who mirrors all of these leanings without any of the obviously bad stuff: the fascist overtones, the laser-eyed jingoism and the genocidal meltdowns. The only problem here is that such a character doesn’t exist, or at least, would be pretty boring to watch. Because once you strip out truth, justice, compassion, doubt, and any hint of moral complexity, what you’re left with isn’t a superhero: it’s a Maga-friendly screensaver with heat vision, great hair and absolutely no sense of irony.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSuperman (Film)Superman (Culture)DC ComicsIron ManX-MenMarvelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It shows that you are moving in certain circles.”The fusion of sport, celebrity and fashion is a growing trend seen across all types of sports including Formula One and football but this year’s Wimbledon, the third of four annual grand slam tennis tournaments, has shown just how integrated the two worlds have become. Tennis has come for luxury fashion and luxury fashion has come for tennis.Thrilling rallies from athletes including Carlos Alcaraz and Coco Gauff have propelled interest in the sport, signalling a transition in the game as this new generation of stars take over after the retirement of greats including Roger Federer and Serena Williams. Yaw-Miller describes Alcaraz as a “new rock star” and “an athlete’s athlete”. After his match against Cameron Norrie, Saka and Jurriën Timber took photos with him.This season the Italian player Lorenzo Musetti used the championships to announce his new Bottega Veneta ambassador role by walking on to the court in a woven, white leather jacket from the brand.

In terms of brand exposure, in the UK in terms of sporting events, it’s No 1.”When an earring worn by Gauff from Missoma’s new tennis collection fell out mid-match,clips of her opponentDayana Yastremska picking it up quickly spread. Some compared it with Chris Evert’s1978 US Open momentwhen her bracelet fell off. “It was one of those awkward moments which just became PR gold,” says Hordern. So far the collection has performed 53% better than the brand had forecast.Eady says an image of a player or a celebrity spectator wearing a piece or carrying an accessory is strongly coveted by brands.It extends to the partners of the athletes too. The influencer Morgan Riddle, who is Taylor Fritz’s girlfriend, regularly partners with brands such as Valentino and Ferragamo on her spectator outfits.According to the data firm Launchmetrics,last year’s appearance of the Challenger’s star Zendaya at the Polo Ralph Lauren suite generatedmore than £2m in media impact valuefor the US brand.Unlike other sporting events, the spectators in the royal box sit in close proximity to the court and often end up in the background of coverage. Eady says: “If you have someone wearing a brand, smiling to the cameras as someone like [Novak] Djokovic wins a final set, that’s the money shot.”Explore more on these topicsFashionCelebrityWimbledonWimbledon 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

A lady called Rhian, who shared my surname, hadsent me a link to a recent BBC news story, which I read with mounting interest.The head office of the Swansea Building Society, the story said, had recently received a postcard postmarked 1903 and originally sent to a girl called Lydia Davies, who had lived at the address. Having mysteriously received the postcard 121 years after it wasposted, staff were hoping to trace one of her descendants.The picture on the card was of a black-and-white print based on an Edwin Landseer oil painting of a stag in the Scottish Highlands. But the other side interested me more. It said: “Dear L, It was unpossible, I could not get the pair of these. I am so sorry! But I hope you are enjoying yourself at home.”The message was signed “Ewart”. The news story added that the postcard had been passed on to the West Glamorgan Archive Service, which had established Lydia was 16, the eldest of six children living at the address in 1903. Ewart, her brother, was 13. I had worked on my family tree and knew immediately that Ewart was my grandfather. Though he had died before I was born, I still had one link with him: his last living child, my aunt Rosemary. I called her – she lives in San Francisco – and she was very excited to hear the news.I then phoned the building society and was put in touch with a BBC producer who wanted to film the postcard being presented to a descendant. The producer said two women related to Lydia had already been in contact – he told me their names, but I’d never heard of them.It was strange to hold something my grandfather had bought as a boyThe meeting was to be filmed at the archive offices in Swansea, and I drove there with my wife from our home in Sussex the next day. I’d never been on TV before and was very nervous. It was all a whirlwind.I was filmed talking to Andrew, the chief archivist, who had photographs of Lydia and Ewart laid out on a table. He showed me the postcard itself, with its King Edward VII stamp. It was strange to hold something my grandfather had bought as a boy, and fascinating to see the words on the back, written with a fountain pen. As we were looking at it, two women walked in, and Andrew said: “I think we have a pair of your relatives here … ”So that’s how I first met my cousins Margaret and Helen. It felt quite surreal as we shook hands and introduced ourselves, knowing this moment was going to be seen by so many people. I’d wondered if they’d seem somehow familiar, but it struck me that I might easily have passed them in the street without ever realising we were related.Ewart and Lydia’s brother Stanley had been the only sibling to remain in Wales – Margaret and Helen were Stanley’s granddaughters and still lived nearby. Lydia’s great-granddaughter Faith also travelled from Devon to meet us for the first time.They brought along photos – we went through them, adding missing pieces to our family jigsaws. It was oddly moving seeing pictures of my great-grandparents for the first time. New connections were made, and anonymous names in my family tree suddenly gained faces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She had seen the news story and thought she might be a descendant. She wasn’t, but had forwarded the story on to other Davies families on Ancestry.com in the hope that one of them might be. Davies is the fifth most common surname in the UK, with a huge concentration in Wales, so it’s a wonder she found me.The mystery of how the postcard arrived at its destination 121 years late may never be fully solved. It’s likely that Lydia did receive it in 1903 – we now know she collected postcards, and Ewart probably sent her one of a pair.It must have passed through the hands of other collectors before someone stuck it back in the post for fun. Little did they know their action would lead to branches of a family being united for the first time. We’ve since heard from a distant relative in Canada – perhaps there will be more. I’d like to imagine Ewart and Lydia would have been astonished but delighted.As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There’s a dizzying variety on offer, ranging from dinky ultralight burners that fit into your pocket to big stove-tops with multiple hobs, grills, wind protectors and a lid – the latter are like bringing along your cooker from home. Most run on gas, such as propane and butane, although I’ve also included charcoal options for traditional types. I’ve tested some of the best portable stoves, for everyone from ultralight wild campers to families who need to cook dinners for the masses.At a glanceBest camping stove overall:Dometic Cadac 2 Cook 2 Pro£99.99 at Robert DyasBest grill:Primus Kuchoma portable grill£154.95 at WildBoundsBest for family camping:Campingaz Camping Kitchen 2 Multi-Cook Plus£160 at Go OutdoorsBest forwild campers:Petromax Atago stove£179.95 at Mountain WarehouseBest for backpacking/best mini stoveMSR Switch system stove£114.75 at WildBoundsWhy you should trust meI’m a keen camper and spend many nights a year under canvas, either wild camping solo in the hills or on weekends away in my bell tent with friends and family. Wherever I pitch my tent, I also love making supper in the great outdoors – whether it’s a bowl of noodles in the wild, a hearty stew at a campsite or a spot of marshmallow toasting on a campfire. With my journalist hat on, I’ve been testing all kinds of outdoor kit for years, so I know what works – and what will last.Read our expert guide tothe best tentsfor more inspirationHow I testedView image in fullscreenEach stove was tasked with cooking camping staples.Photograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianI fired up each of these nine stoves and cooked camping staples such as porridge, pancakes and fried eggs, as well as checking how long it took to boil water on each. I looked for an easy setup without any complicated instructions to follow and tested to see if each stove cooked evenly and reliably, and that the components felt good quality and built to last.I hate cleaning stoves, but I took one for the team and gave each of my top-rated models a good scrub to see how easy they were to get spick and span after use. My selection of the best camping stoves includes lightweight numbers and multi-hob monsters, as well as a great mini grill and even a smoker you can take camping.The best camping stoves in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianBestcamping stove overall:Cadac 2 Cook 2 ProView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian£99.99 at Robert Dyas£125 at DecathlonThis is a compact gas stove with two independent burners. It also has built-in ignition, and ceramic-coated flat and ribbed grill plates, allowing for simultaneous grilling, frying and boiling. It weighs 4.8kg and is compatible with butane and propane.Why we love itThere are camping stoves out there to suit everyone, from the hardiest mountaineer who wants to fit a stove in the palm of their hand to the van-lifers in need of a setup that would rival a kitchen. If pressed, I’d say this was the best camping stove I tested overall.It’s lightweight, at less than 5kg, and is portable, folding into its case for carrying and storage. Pop off the lid and there are two burners, each with its own built-in ignition, so you can have coffee going on one and bacon and eggs sizzling on the other. You can also stick two grill surfaces (a ceramic flat plate grill and a ribbed grill plate) on top and simply pop ingredients straight on to sizzle and sear. The case makes for fuss- and mess-free storage in your van or car boot (or cupboard back at home), and it sits sturdily on tabletops.This is ideal for campervans or on family camping trips, although it would benefit from the addition of a wind guard, as it doesn’t like anything stronger than a mild breeze. This is also a well-priced camping stove.It’s a shame that… it doesn’t like high winds.Weight:4.8kgBurners:twoFuel type:gasTime to boil water: six minutesBest grill:Primus Kuchoma portable grillView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian£154.95 at WildBounds£163.40 at Cotswold OutdoorThe Swedish-designed Primus Kuchoma is a lightweight, portable gas-powered grill designed for outdoor cooking adventures. Weighing 4.6kg, it features a ceramic non-stick grill grate, a stainless-steel drip tray and foldable legs.Why we love itThe Kuchoma felt rather like the Cadac 2 Cook 2 Pro in terms of shape, size and portability, but it’s a dedicated grill rather than a two-burner. This was the most portable grill I could find to test, and if you love a proper barbecue but want to travel light, it’ll be your bestie, allowing you to sizzle a steak or brown toast wherever you pitch your tent (or simply on the beach, patio or in the garden).I liked the foldout legs, which protect the ground and make a solid base for the grill, and there’s room on the Kuchoma to cook supper for two people, with heat distributed well across one wide grill plate. The steel hood seals tight, too, so the burner stays lit in windy weather. It’s quick to remove the grill to wash it and wipe clean the grease tray.If you already own a stove, this will be a great addition to liven up your camping culinary adventures more exciting – but it won’t cover the basics such as boiling the kettle or making pasta.It’s a shame that…it’s expensive, especially for a one-trick pony.Weight:4.6kgBurners:oneFuel type:gasTime to boil water:not applicableBest for family camping:Campingaz Camping Kitchen 2 Multi-Cook PlusView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian£160 at Go Outdoors£213.99 at DecathlonThis larger (but still portable) stove has a triple burner, so you can boil, saute and grill all at once. It all sits atop a table and storage shelf with screw-on legs, making for an instant family cooking setup wherever you roam.Why we love itLike to take everything camping but the kitchen sink? Campingaz’s Camping Kitchen 2 Multi-Cook Plus takes the brand’s populardouble-burner stoveand adds a sturdy table, storage shelf and aluminium griddle with a small burner. This allows you to boil the kettle, stir baked beans and toast bread at the same time – perfect for a proper brekkie. There are also two small-but-useful side tables that are perfect for prep or condiments.Campingaz uses Flameguard technology to improve fuel efficiency, and I did find it more windproof than some other double-burners, but it didn’t boil water significantly faster in my tests. It’s quick to set up – just screw on the legs if you want to use it as a table, and then pop the lid – and it includes built-in ignition.It was my favourite stove for cooking for family and friends, with room for larger pans, and the handy table is a makeshift kitchen even in the most basic camping spot. Another bonus: it’s easy to keep clean, with removable griddle and pan supports.It’s a shame that… it doesn’t have pull-out windguards to help preserve energy, although I can’t find much to critique about this setup.Weight:5.4kgBurners:threeFuel type:gasTime to boil water:seven minutesBest forwild campers:Petromax AtagoView image in fullscreen£179.95 at Mountain Warehouse£179.95 at B&QThe Atago is a four-in-one charcoal cooking kit designed to function as a grill, stove, oven and firepit. It’s made from stainless steel, which makes it durable, and features a double-walled design for efficient heat retention, plus it has a one-step folding mechanism for portability. It’s also compatible with various iterations of Petromax cast-iron cookware.Why we love itThis might be the hardiest portable stove on the market. The stainless-steel unit uses charcoal or charcoal briquettes for fuel, so it’s ideal for wild campers, foragers and explorers who fancy cooking a feast when they’re far from the nearest plug socket or shop.The Atago is designed to be compatible with Petromax’sDutch ovens, woks, pans and even acamping coffee percolator, although you’ll have to buy these separately – and this cooking system is already expensive. You’ll also have to tend to a fire rather than just turn on the gas, though I found the Atago easy to light and use, plus grilling meat and fish on charcoal gave a wonderful smoky flavour.Gourmet chefs who want to produce Instagram-worthy eats even if they’re in the wild will love this setup, and I liked that it converts into a fire bowl – a great way to have a campfire without causing damage wherever you set up your tent. All in all, this is a fun mini mobile kitchen, and worth investing in if you’re serious about food even when you’re in the backcountry.It’s a shame that …it’s expensive – and you’ll have to buy the accessories.Weight:6.1kgBurners:oneFuel type:charcoal, charcoal briquettes and firewoodTime to boil water:five minutes (once the fire is hot)Best backpacking/best mini:MSR SwitchView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian£114.75 at WildBounds£135 at Valley and PeakMSR (Mountain Safety Research) is a US-based outfitter whose tents I rate. In fact, it makes thebest tent overallfrom our recent test. It calls this stove “the ultimate all-in-one cooking system” – and it’slightweight, compact and efficient. The brand aims the Switch at backpackers and mountaineers who want to boil water fast in the integrated pot, but it also allows you to use other pots and pans.Why we love itThis “personal stove system” is a clever all-in-one option that solo backpackers, bikepackers and wild campers can pop in their rucksack and fire up anywhere. The included pot has a rounded bottom that MSR reckons makes it more efficient at boiling water than a flat design (so much so that there’s a patent pending on it). I found it boiled water very quickly – it was the quickest stove in my test, at three minutes, and made the morning coffee round a pleasure.The pot holds 600ml for boiling and has handy markers so you can boil enough water for a cuppa or to fill a ration pack, and it slots easily on to the round potholder above the flame. It’s easy to adjust the stove’s power, too, and there’s a handy cork cosy around the pot for insulation and to make it easier to hold if you’re munching your noodles straight from it.You don’t need to use MSR’s integrated pot all the time, either: fold-out pot supports will take larger pans if you’re doing more than boiling water, and there’s a built-in igniter, so there’s no fiddling with old lighters or wet matches. The Switch only really has the capacity to cook for one, though. While it weighs just under 400g, this isn’t the lightest solo system out there – however, I do think it’s one of the best for quality.It’s a shame that… it’s not the lightest system on the market.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

MSR’s XGK EX is a popular choice with hardy outdoorsy types as it burns white gas, paraffin and diesel. It’s a hard-wearing stove that should last a long time; its stainless-steel, scorpion-like legs provide a wide, sturdy surface for your pot.All this little stove really does is boil liquids (albeit fast and reliably, and it will also melt snow in harsh weather conditions), so you can’t simmer your meal or make anything complicated. It’s pricey, too, so casual campers need not splash their cash here, though for international adventures – where you really need to rely on your kit – it’s worth the spend.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s expensive and has no temperature control.Weight:366gBurners:oneFuel type:gas, paraffin and dieselTime to boil water: three to five minutesBar-Be-Quick smoker and grill barbecueView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian£79.99 at Robert Dyas£85 at ArgosBest for:a portablebarbecue and smokerA smoker you can take into the sticks? The Bar-Be-Quick’s multilayered design looks too hefty to be portable at first glance – but this smoker and grill (which weighs 8.3kg) will fit into larger cars if you fancy a gourmet camping feast. It can also be converted into a small portable barbecue by taking away the top section, making it ideal for shorter trips. You can then choose whether you fancy smoking, grilling, roasting or steaming ingredients.During testing, it took me a few goes to put the smoker grill together and then to use it correctly, but once I got the hang of it cooking was simple – and more fun than your standard barbecue or camping stove. It works well as a simple charcoal grill, too. This grill perhaps isn’t as solid as some premium models, but it’s good fun and affordable.It didn’t make the final cut because…it’s flimsier than some models on test.Weight:8.3kgBurners:oneFuel type:charcoalTime to boil water:not applicablePrimus MojaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: The Guardian£129.95 at WildBounds£166.95 at AmazonBest for:a single burnerMany of the stoves I tested came with a lot of bells, whistles and removable accessories – not so with the Moja, which is pleasingly simple and does one job very well. Open the slim carry case and there’s a single, powerful burner designed for cooking for one to three people. At 2.3kg, the Moja is lightweight enough to be portable for camping andfestivals, and it will easily fit into cars (or a backpack at a pinch). It’s also a great size to use as a makeshift cooker in smaller campervans, caravans and boats.Fire up the Moja, and pots sit solidly on top – the lid is removable if you’re using a wider pan. The hob boils water in about five minutes, and the removable drip tray also made this one of the easiest stoves on test to clean.It didn’t make the final cut because …its use is limited.Weight:2.3kgBurners: oneFuel type: gasTime to boil water:five minutesRobens Fire BeetleView image in fullscreen£34.95 at Outdoor Action£49 at AmazonBest for:an affordable, lightweight stoveRedefining what it means to be a “Beetles fan”, this compact stove may be small but it’s also mighty. It weighs just 189g – not as featherweight as the teeny, less-than-50g stoves favoured by hardcore hikers, but it’s great for its price and will do just fine for most backpackers and trekkers.The Beetle folds out into a surprisingly sturdy pot stand, which I found steady even on uneven surfaces. I’d suggest adding a foil windscreen if you’re out in the wild, as it proved pretty sensitive to any kind of wind, but it was easy to light and control the power of the flame, and it boiled water fast. Other reviewers report this stove doesn’t work well in winter conditions, but in spring it was an efficient cooking companion I barely noticed in my pack – and it’s well priced.It didn’t make the final cut because …there are lighter stoves out there if the weight is really important to you.Weight:189gBurners:oneFuel type:gasTime to boil water: four minutesWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianKey features to look out forA lightweight canister stove is ideal for boiling water quickly for solo hikers and minimalists, but less suited to multi-pot gourmet meals. For groups or more elaborate campsite cooking, I’d opt for a dual-burner stove so you’ve got room for frying, simmering and brewing coffee all in one place. Ensure you buy the correct fuel canister for your stove.The most common models use gas or liquid fuel (paraffin etc), and different canisters are designed to clip or screw on to different stoves. This can be confusing to shop for. Most gas stoves run off propane, butane or a mixture of the two gases. First, check what fuel is recommended for use with your new stove – some are compatible only with branded gas canisters, while others allow multiple fuel options. If you’re camping in cold weather, it’s sensible to pick propane if you can, as it has a lower boiling point.Gas canisters come in different sizes – mini ones are great for wild campers, while big refillable bottles will suit family weekenders. Larger stoves may require a refillable gas bottle – these also usually need you to buy a separate regulator, but they are more eco-friendly, as they can be used again and again. Check if you need a clip-in or screw-in canister and have a go at setting up your new stove with the gas cylinder before you go camping, so you’re confident it works.Whatever stove you go for, look for features such as wind protection, simmer control and easy ignition (built-in igniters are handy in case you forget to bring matches). Weight, packability and setup time are also important – especially if you’re trekking rather than car camping.How to choose a camping stove that will lastIt’s worth investing in the best camping stove you can afford. Stainless steel and titanium offer durability and rust resistance. Canister stoves are perfect for lightweight trips, but make sure you look for sturdy pot supports and quality valves. Liquid fuel stoves often come with serviceable parts, a major plus for longevity.Fuel efficiency is just as important for the planet and your wallet, and a wind-resistant burner will save fuel – and frustration. Wood-burning stoves will appeal to the off-grid minimalist and should last for ever if they’re well constructed.How to use a camping stoveFind a stable, flat surface away from tents or dry brush. Wind is your enemy, so shield the stove. Attach the fuel canister or line securely and double-check for leaks before lighting. Most camping stoves require you to turn on the gas and then light with a match or lighter, or click the built-in igniter. Some will burn with a bright blue flame; others are hard to see alight but make a roaring noise. If it’s windy, watch carefully to make sure the flame hasn’t gone out.We’ve included wood and charcoal stoves and grills in our roundup – these usually require you to light a fire with kindling and then add bigger pieces of wood until you have a fire hot enough to cook over. Never cook inside your tent: you could poison yourself with carbon monoxide fumes. It’s a sensible idea to have a go at setting up your stove at home first before you head off on holiday – there’s little more frustrating than realising you brought the wrong fuel when you’re desperate for a cuppa.Sian Lewis is an award-winningoutdoors and travel journalist and author who loves putting adventure kit through its paces while hiking, swimming and wild camping.

Summer heatwaves are so frequent, they’re stretching the bounds of what we think of as summer. Hot-and-bothered home working and sweaty, sleepless nights are now alarmingly common.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Get a good fan, and you can dodge the temptation of air conditioning. Air con is incredibly effective, but it uses a lot of electricity … and burning fossil fuels is how we got into this mess in the first place. Save money and carbon by opting for a great fan instead.Fans are much more energy efficient than air con. A typical portable air conditioner uses 1,000W of electricity, which would cost about 26p an hour to run. The fans I tested used between 8W and 60W; my favourite, the AirCraft Lume, used 18W on its top setting. You could run it on max for 56 hours, and it would still use no more electricity (money, carbon) than a single air con unit going for an hour.I tested 14 fans of all shapes and sizes, so you can pick the best one for you. I tested them for size, noise, power use and, of course, how much they cool you down. I also tested a few “evaporative coolers”, which use water to cool the air blowing at you while using significantly less energy than air con.Due to recent heatwaves, stock is running low on some models – we’ve marked up any that are out of stock at the time of publication.At a glanceBest fan overall:AirCraft Lume£149 at AirCraftBest tower fan:Dreo Cruiser TF518£99.99 at AmazonBest travel fan:Morphy Richards Air Flex USB fan£39.99 at AmazonBest evaporative cooler:Swan Nordic air cooler£69.99 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI’m an award-winning consumer tech journalist with decades of experience testing gadgets. I’m also a menopausal woman in her 50s who honestly can’t remember the last time she felt cold: I think that might be why we gravitate towild swimmingin middle age. Oh, and I have a degree in engineering. So I’m triply qualified to put these fans through their paces, scientifically and subjectively.How I testedView image in fullscreenAn anemometer was used to measure the air speed each fan generates on its top setting.Photograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianI chose 14 fans, each from different brands, aiming for a mix of new and highly rated models plus a few stellar bargains. I wanted to make sure there was something for everyone before I put them through their paces.I used a power meter to measure how much electricity (and therefore money and carbon) the fans use, an anemometer to measure the air speed they generate on the top setting, and the Sound Meter app to measure the noise on the top setting (they were all too quiet to register on their lowest).I measured everything from 1m away, although in reality, you’ll probably position a tower or pedestal fan farther away and a desk fan closer to you. That means the noise a desk fan makes matters more.I also measured them myself, as sometimes the official specs can be misleading or wrong. For example, I measured a tower fan that was supposedly 17cm wide, only to find that wasn’t including the base. Here I’ve stuck with each fan’s largest dimensions, including their footprint.I used a thermometer to measure the impact of the evaporative coolers I tested, and took note of everything from how cooling each of the fans felt, how annoying the noise was and how good the controls were. I also considered how they looked and how small they packed away, as well as the price tag.All the fans that weren’t returned to the manufacturers were donated toFurnishing Futures, a charity that furnishes the empty social homes in which women and children are placed after domestic abuse.The best fans in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianBest fan overall:AirCraft LumeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£149 at AirCraftPreorder now for delivery during week commencing 11 AugustThis pedestal fan was hard to fault, with an elegant design that boasts a dimmable backlight (three brightness levels or you can turn it off, all with the remote control). It’s billed as height adjustable, but rather than scooting up and down, you can remove the bottom pole to convert it into a 63cm desk fan. There’s an LED display and touch controls on the front, and other features include a 12-hour timer and a sleep mode.Of all I tested, this is probably the best fan for sleeping: it’s the best for low noise relative to wind speed. Pick a lower setting for silent cooling, a higher setting if you’re happy to doze off to the white noise, or use the sleep button if you’d like it to gradually reduce power in the night. I found the lower settings cooling enough to get to sleep on a hot night during a heatwave.Why we love itWhen I’m working from home or relaxing (I can’t say chilling out when it’s 30C+), the AirCraft Lume is the fan that I reach for. I love it for many reasons. It’s light but with a reassuringly heavy base, giving it Weeble-like stability: it’s difficult to knock over. It packs away pretty small for the winter because the pole comes apart. I also liked that the packaging is almost plastic-free.It oscillates both horizontally and vertically, so it can circulate air nicely around a whole room. Most importantly of all, this fan can really shift air – its 5.9m/s (metres a second) result was the best on test, and you can really feel it. During a recent heatwave, I found the powerful breeze genuinely cooling. And it’s quiet: in fact, I can’t hear it at all on levels 1-5, so I need to be careful that I remember to turn off the fan when I step away. All for a reasonable price, too.It’s a shame that …there’s nowhere to stow the remote control when it’s not in use.Style:pedestal (or desk)Dimensions:37 x 28 x 95cm (WDH)Number of speeds:12Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:55dBPower use on top setting:18WAir speed on top setting:5.9 metres a second (m/s)Beat the heat: 14 expert tips for keeping cool in hot weatherRead moreBest budget fan and best desk fan:DevoladeskfanView image in fullscreen£59.95 at Devola£59.95 at AirconCentreCurrently out of stockThis affordable desk fan punches well above its weight, with good features and powerful airflow. It has a display, touch controls, a remote, a timer and sleep mode. You can choose vertical oscillation (90 degrees), horizontal oscillation (80 degrees) or use both to circulate the air in a room. Not bad for a humble desk fan.Why we love itIt’s a bargain powerhouse, producing a substantial wind. I measured an air speed of 4m/s, which was among the best on test. It certainly felt cooling.I couldn’t hear the Devola on the first three of its nine speeds, despite being powerfully cooling, and even when the noise got louder on higher settings, it wasn’t too annoying. In fact, while the AirCraft Lume is my favourite bedside fan, the Devola perched on a bedside table does a good job on a budget. It’s powerfully cooling, inaudible on lower settings (1-3 out of 9) and on high settings, the white noise is OK to go to sleep to. Just don’t use the sleep setting: it’s noisier than it should be, so picking a medium setting worked best. Even the high settings provide a level of white noise I could go to sleep to.It’s a shame that …the display is on the base facing upwards, so you can’t see it unless you’re nearby. There was no instruction manual in the box, either, although I found it straightforward to use.Style:deskDimensions:30 x 21 x 31cm (WDH)Number of speeds:9Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:50dBPower use on top setting:16WAir speed on top setting:4m/sBest tower fan:Dreo Cruiser TF518View image in fullscreen£99.99 at Amazon£109.99 with wifi voice control at B&QThis tower fan is slim but striking in black. Features include 90-degree oscillation, a 0- to 12-hour timer, a sleep mode where the fan speed decreases gradually, and an auto mode that adapts the fan speed depending on the room temperature.Why we love itAt full blast, the Dreo felt positively windy and was definitely cooling on a hot day. On the two lowest settings, no sound was audible, but I could still feel a gentle breeze. I also liked the recess at the top-back that makes it easy to carry with one hand.It’s billed as a “25dB silent bladeless fan”, but I measured 60dB on top whack from a metre away. The sound wasn’t too annoying, though, and the fan’s powerful cooling made it forgivable.It’s a shame that …its energy consumption is relatively high. We’re talking pennies in electricity, but still, energy efficiency is good. Also, there’s nowhere to clip the remote control.Style:towerDimensions:32 x 32 x 106cm (WDH)Number of speeds:9Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:60dBPower use on top setting:29WAir speed on top setting:3.6m/sBest travel fan:Morphy Richards Air FlexUSBfanView image in fullscreen£39.99 at Amazon£39.99 at Robert DyasThis is the fan you can take with you anywhere. I don’t mean to fan yourself by hand: it folds down small and it’s cordless and USB rechargeable, so you can be the smuggest person on the train and a very happy camper on a hot day. It can also give you a breeze on a still day on the patio. The battery will last from four to 17 hours, depending on fan speed. And you can plug it into a laptop at your desk or even apower bankfor more juice.Why we love itThe 2.6m/s air speed can’t compete with the big fans on test – and it wasn’t the one I reached for during a heatwave – but that’s not what it’s for. It’s an electric fan that can go anywhere, folding down to a cylinder measuring 18 x 18 x 12cm. You can even hang it on the wall, if you wish. It’s rechargeable and you can even use it with aUSB power bankto keep it running anywhere, so you can cool down in a tent or on the train. Far better than a handheld fan. I’d definitely take this fan on holiday.There’s no timer or sleep mode, but there’s a “nature mode” that varies the speed to mimic a breeze. And it does oscillate (to 90 degrees). It’s also quiet: I couldn’t hear it on the first of its three speeds, and it was never loud enough to be annoying.It’s a shame that …air speed dips slightly when it’s not plugged in, but only slightly (2.5m/s instead of 2.6m/s)Style:deskDimensions:18 x 18 x 22cm (WDH)Number of speeds:3Remote control?NoPeak noise level on test:35dBPower use on top setting:8WAir speed on top setting:2.6m/sBestevaporative cooler:SwanNordic air coolerView image in fullscreen£69.99 at SwanCurrently out of stock£69.99 at AmazonPreorder for delivery on 4 AugustThe air speed may not be great, but this Swan model is still a good buy because it’s an evaporative cooler, meaning it uses water from its five-litre reservoir to cool the air it blows at you. It can be used as a regular fan, too. Evaporative coolers are much more energy efficient than air conditioning, so they use much less power (and therefore less carbon, assuming you’re not on a renewable tariff or producing your own electricity).Why we love itOf the two evaporative coolers I tested, this worked the best. I could see the temperature on the thermometer go down: it cooled by more than 1C in less than 30 minutes. And it felt like a cooling breeze. In fact, it felt a bit like air con.I just filled it with water, but it comes with two ice packs that you can pre-freeze and throw into the reservoir for even colder results.The breeze felt wide, rather than focused. This is a question of personal taste: some people want a powerful fan that’s focused to blast just them, while others prefer a room-filling breeze. In oscillating mode, it’s wider still, as the grille at the front rotates, which is a bit hypnotic. It’s good-looking, too, in a coffee-coloured oatmeal or grey finish. It’s light and on casters, so easy to move around, and its modes include normal, natural, sleep and timer.It’s a shame that …you can hear the water in the pipes: it sounded like a leak. You might even find yourself needing the loo. I also found myself reaching for a fan on a hot day – it provides a light breeze, not a blast of wind. But the air that it puts out is genuinely cooler than the rest of the air in the room.Style:towerDimensions:29 x 24 x 71cm (WDH)Number of speeds:24Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:45dBPower use on top setting:26WAir speed on top setting:0.9m/sThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianLevoit classic tower fanView image in fullscreen£89.99 at AmazonPreorder for delivery on 29 July-26 AugustBest for:a quieter tower fanThis produces a narrow beam of air, so you need to point it at you just right or set it to oscillate (90 degrees). It’s billed as a “20dB silent tower fan”, and it’s inaudible on the lowest four of its 12 speeds, but it was considerably louder at top whack.It’s good-looking, and I liked the space in the back to stow the remote control.

It’s useful year-round, too, doubling as a fan heater. But it’s hard to categorise: too short for a tower fan, too tall for a desk fan.There’s a timer and it oscillates horizontally (71 degrees) and vertically (180 degrees), though it’s hard to imagine why you’d want to point it completely down. The touch controls are at the base, which isn’t very practical if it’s on the floor, and the display was a bit hard to see.It didn’t make the final cut because …I found the noise a bit annoying; I could hear it at levels 2-10.Style:tower;dimensions:25 x 24 x 65cm (WDH);number of speeds:10;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:35dB;power use on top setting:28W;air speed on top setting:2.9m/sHoneywell10-litre evaporative air coolerView image in fullscreen£109.99 at B&QCurrently out of stockBest for:a quiet evaporative coolerskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Its swing mode moves horizontally, and you can manually move the grilles to angle the air up or down. It’s on casters, too.I liked its large (10-litre) water capacity and how quiet it was, but the fan wasn’t strong enough, and the evaporative mode wasn’t cold enough. I tried it several times, and in half an hour, it never managed to cool the area in front by a degree.It didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t cool the room down enough.Style:tower;dimensions:31 x 30 x 75cm (WDH);number of speeds:3;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:30dB;power use on top setting:39W;air speed on top setting:1.8m/sShark TurboBlade TF200SUKView image in fullscreen£250 at Argos£249.99 at AmazonBest for:pointing in two directions at onceThis bladeless fan’s unusual T-shaped design has arms that stick out left and right, each putting out air, or you can turn them by 90 degrees for a tall, thin fan. You can angle each arm independently, good for pointing at two people. It’s height-adjustable and can oscillate (180 degrees) horizontally too. I liked that the remote attaches to the top with a strong magnet.It’s powerful, but the sound is very annoying: it sounds like a vacuum cleaner, and I wanted it to stop. It also used the most power on test; even still, a 60W fan costs less than 2p an hour to run at the current energy price cap, so it’s pennies compared with air con.It didn’t make the final cut because …I hated the noise it makes.Style:pedestal;dimensions:80 x 30 x 78-95cm (WDH), or 124 x 30 x 114-130cm in vertical mode;number of speeds:10;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:35dB;power use on top setting:60W;air speed on top setting:3.1m/sDuux Whisper Flex 2View image in fullscreen£179.99 at AmazonBest for:smart controlsThis took quite a bit of assembly, but it’s good-looking, can be converted into a 54cm-high desk fan by removing a pole, and the tech is clever too. You can control it with an app or by voice (Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant) to set up to seven schedules. There’s an optional battery and charging dock to make it cordless.It’s fairly quiet and oscillates well, vertically and horizontally, but I found the standard controls annoying. The display on the base points upwards, so it’s hard to see from across the room, and you have to point the remote very accurately at it.I did like the compostable packaging. But unusually, it drew far too much power (2W) on standby.

Features include a one to 12-hour timer and a sleep mode that decreases fan speed every 30 minutes through the night.It didn’t make the final cut because …I liked the Devola desk fan even more, but this is a solid buy too.Style:desk;dimensions:30 x 21 x 36cm (WDH);number of speeds:12;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:45dB;power use on top setting:13W;air speed on top setting:2.7m/sDyson Cool CF1View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£249.99 at Dyson£249.99 at DebenhamsBest for:looks and designYou can see a lot of thought has gone into the CF1’s design. Not just its simple, circular air multiplier, but every single detail. The display is small but very readable. The oscillation (15, 40 or 70 degrees) works well. The magnetic storage on top for the remote control is clever. The controls work well and let you easily set the timer and sleep mode.I couldn’t hear this bladeless fan on the first six of its 10 speeds, and I found the noise easy to live with even at higher speeds.It didn’t make the final cut because …the price is hard to justify.

Its three-year warranty is a bonus, too (most have two).Overall, I liked it. It’s good-looking and pretty strong, although it’s weaker when cordless; for example, air speed dropped from an impressive 4.6m/s to 3.1m/s when I unplugged it.

They don’t have to be old-fashioned; some have modern designs. And some are convertible, with a pole you can remove to turn them into a desk fan. They can be good for a focused blast of cooling wind.Bladeless fansaren’t magic; they just don’t have visible blades. The work is done in the body of the fan, and then air is pushed out of a nozzle. The Dyson, VortexAir and Shark on test are all bladeless. They look modern and are easy to clean. And there are no moving parts on show, meaning zero chance of getting your hair caught.Tower fansare tall and narrow. They produce a lot of wind and oscillate from side to side, making them good for a room like an office.Desk fansare like pedestal fans without the pole. They’re not only for desks, they’re good on a bedside table too. And they take up less storage space over the winter.Evaporative coolersuse water from a reservoir to cool the air that blows at you. They don’t produce a powerful wind like a fan, but they genuinely cool the room and are much more energy efficient than air conditioning. Note that they only cool the room a little – they won’t turn it fridge cold like air con.What does oscillation mean?Most fans oscillate (move back and forth) by swivelling on their base, and some let you select how wide an angle you want. If it’s just for you, pick a narrow angle; if you’re cooling the whole office, go wide. Some fans achieve the same effect in other ways, such as by moving louvres. Some also oscillate up and down, so the fan can circulate air all over the room to create a gentle breeze.What’s sleep mode?Most fans have a sleep mode, where every 30 or 60 minutes the fan lowers its setting until it reaches a certain point. This is a good compromise that helps you get to sleep without wasting energy, minimising the risk of waking up in the middle of the night suddenly cold.Start by lowering the fan speed to the point where you don’t find it annoying. In fact, some people find the white noise of a fan helpful at bedtime. Then switch to sleep mode.The best sleep aids recommended by experts: from blue light-blockers to apps to help you napRead moreWhere is the best place to position a fan?For personal comfort, simply point it towards you. The cooling feeling is because the moving air from the fan displaces the warm, humid air near your skin, which in turn helps your sweat evaporate, cooling your body down. It’s like a breeze rather than a still day. Or why it feels colder swimming in a river than in a lake, even if the water temperature is the same. Evaporative coolers, of which I’ve included two above, use water to actively cool the air.Never place a fan up against a wall because air needs to flow into the back. If the air’s cooler outside, put the fan in front of an open window or door to bring in the cooler air.How much does a fan cost to use?I’ll set out the maths. For each fan here, I’ve measured its power use on the top setting, in watts (W). Electricity costs are in kilowatt hours (kWh). If, for example, you were using a 30W fan for five hours, it would use 150Wh. Divide by 1,000 to convert it to kilowatt hours: 0.150kWh.The energy price cap for 1 July to 30 September 2025 is 25.73p per kWh. Multiply this by the last figure and you’ll discover it will cost just under 4p to run that fan for five hours. Or £14 to run it for five hours every day for a year.Running fans is pretty cheap, then, and a good fan will keep you cool enough to dodge buying any kind of air conditioning. An evaporative cooler is a good alternative to air con. The two I tested used 26W (Swan) and 39W (Honeywell), so they use about 3% of the electricity of a typical portable air conditioner (1,000W). The effect isn’t the same: you can’t turn your bedroom into a fridge. But you can cool the air enough to make a big difference when there’s a heatwave.Do I need air conditioning?If you’re in the UK, honestly, no. It’s tempting to turn your bedroom into a walk-in fridge on a hot day, but fans are great and use much less electricity (and therefore money and carbon) than air con. Unless you’re on a renewable tariff, electricity use accelerates climate breakdown.Caramel Quin is ajournalist specialising in consumer technology.

They’re surprisingly easy to make from scratch, too. The base is an incredibly light genoise sponge that’s topped with a layer of jelly, and it’s this section that allows for some creativity. I chose to go down a summery route with passion fruit. Juicing enough passion fruit to get 200ml of liquid is tedious (and expensive), so by all means use a carton of juice instead.Passion fruit jaffa cakesPrep5 minChill3 hr+Cook45 minMakes9For the jelly3½ sheets platinum-grade gelatine200mlpassion fruit juice, fresh or from a cartonFor the cakeButter, for greasing35g plain flour,plus extra for dusting1 large egg35g caster sugar¼ tsp salt75gdark chocolate, choppedStart by making the jelly. Put the gelatine in a small bowl of cold water and leave to soften for five minutes. Meanwhile, line a small, roughly 20cm x 15cm baking dish or tray with baking paper.Put the passion fruit juice in a saucepan, heat gently until steaming, then, before it comes to a boil, take off the heat. Squeeze out the excess water from the softened gelatine, add the sheets to the juice and stir to dissolve. Pour into the lined dish and chill in the fridge for three to four hours, until firmly set.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Lightly grease nine holes of a cupcake tray, then lightly dust them with flour.Put the egg and sugar in a bowl and use an electric whisk to whip until thick and fluffy. Sift on the flour and salt, then fold in gently, taking care not to knock out too much air. Spoon about a tablespoon of batter into each greased cupcake hole, then bake for 15 minutes, until golden and springy to the touch. Remove from the oven, leave to cool in the tin for a few minutes, then turn out the cakes.Use a cutter slightly smaller than the width of the cakes to stamp out nine discs of the set jelly, then place one on top of each cake.Melt the chocolate in short bursts in the microwave (or over a bain-marie), then leave to cool a little. Spoon a little chocolate on to each cake, nudging it around evenly, then leave to firm up before serving.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotBakingChocolateFruitCakeBiscuitsSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"

The lack of Campari means it’s much lighter than the dark red of the traditional negroni, while the rosé vermouth means it’s also more delicate, making this ideal for summer drinking. The much underusedSuzeis a French gentian aperitif bitter that complements the aromatics of rosé vermouth very nicely.

Prawns are my seafood of choice at home, and I lean into store-cupboard staples to bring together easy, quick meals for my small family. Today’s glorious noodle salad is perfect for summer, not least because it’s a simple assembly job, while the second recipe, if you make a little effort to devein some shell-on prawns, rewards you with the most magnificent plate of them that you’ll ever eat.Spicy glass noodle and prawn salad (pictured top)Kerabuis an umbrella term in Malay denoting a vibrant salad of vegetables and herbs, dressed with a fiery sambal, shrimp paste and lime to bring everything together. The dressing is spicy, sharp and smells wonderful from all the herbs. You might also findkerabunoodle salads. This is my very easy version, perfect for hot days, because it doesn’t involve any cooking. I’ve substituted tinned anchovies (use the best you can afford) for the shrimp paste to avoid having to toast the paste. Coincidentally, when I blitzed up the first test of this dressing, it smelled very much likecincalok, another Malaysian speciality of fermented krill mixed with shallots and chillies. A traditional kerabusalad will always include laksa leaves (AKA hot mint), but these are tricky to find in the UK, so I have used a mixture of herbs more commonly found in British supermarkets, not least because I find that the basil goes a little way towards the fragrant pepperiness of hot mint.Prep25 minSoak10 minServes4-6For the dressing2 fresh red chillies, seeds and all, stalks discarded, flesh finely chopped1 banana shallot, peeled and roughly chopped4 fresh makrut lime leaves, stems removed50gtin anchovy fillets, not drainedJuice of ½-1 lime, to taste1 tbsp dark brown sugar3 tbspchilli sauce(I make my own tomato sambal (see recipe below), but I also likeMaggi’s garlic chilli sauceor sriracha), plus extra to serve1 tbsp fish sauce1 tsp tamarind paste, or Worcestershire sauce (I useLea & Perrins)3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilFor the salad150g mung bean glass noodles, or rice vermicelli noodles, soaked in just-boiled water for at least 10 minutes30gbunch fresh basil(Thai, holy or regular), leaves picked30gbunch fresh mint, leaves picked and roughly chopped30gbunchfresh coriander, roughly chopped, stems and all300gcooked and peeled small cold-water prawns(defrosted if frozen, and any excess water gently squeezed out)¾ cucumber, deseeded and cut into 1cm cubesPut all the dressing ingredients in a small food processor and blitz to a smooth puree.Drain the soaked noodles and put them in a large bowl. Roughly tear the basil leaves into the noodles.At least 15 minutes before you want to serve, to give all the flavours a chance to come together, put all the remaining ingredients and the dressing into the noodle bowl, mix thoroughly and set aside. That said, if you’re making this well in advance, don’t add the cucumber until 15 minutes before serving, because it releases water after a while, which will make for a very wet salad. Serve with extra sambal or chilli sauce on the side.Tomato sambalView image in fullscreenMandy Yin’s homemade tomato sambal.This brilliant sambal is a perfect balance of spicy, sweet and tangy, and I’ll take it any day over sriracha and even my beloved Maggi garlic chilli sauce. The best thing is that it comes together extremely easily and quickly, and keeps for months in the fridge.Prep5 minCook15 minMakes300g150gfresh red chillies, stalks discarded, flesh roughly chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped60mlvegetable oil3 tbsp tomato puree1½ tsp table salt4½ tbsp dark brown sugarUsing a stick blender or a high-speed blender, blitz the chillies, garlic and oil to a fine puree. Put a small, nonstick saucepan on a medium heat, add the chilli-garlic mixture and stir-fry for 10 minutes; if it starts to splutter too much, turn down the heat a little. Add the tomato puree, salt, sugar and 80ml water, stir-fry for two minutes, just to dissolve everything, then take off the heat and leave to cool. Once cool, decant into a sterilised jar, seal and store in the fridge.Greg’s spicy fried prawnsView image in fullscreenDaddy’s girl: Mandy Yin’s spicy fried prawns are inspired by her father.This is an excellent dish from my dad’s repertoire. It is based on a dish he used to have as a child in a Chinese restaurant in Malacca. We know it ashar lokfried prawns. Yes, it’s a bit fiddly, because it requires you todeveinshell-on prawns, but that’s just about the only real work involved. Frozen, whole, raw jumbo prawns from the supermarket freezer aisle are generally cheaper than fresh ones, so by all means use them instead. The magic of the prawn-infused sauce comes from thetomalleyreleased from the prawn heads and shells.Prep5 minCook30 minServes41kglarge shell-onprawns, defrosted if using frozen4 tbsp vegetable oil2 fresh red chillies, finely sliced4 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced3 tbsp light soy sauce110gketchup– I use Heinz¼ tsp chilli powderDevein the prawns by sticking a toothpick through the second shell joint from the tail and pulling up through the flesh. The vein will become loose, so all you have to do then is to pull out the rest of it. Use scissors to trim off each prawn’s two long feelers and snip off the very sharp end of the prawn’s head.Put the oil in a large nonstick wok on a high heat. Add the chillies and half the spring onions, stir-fry for a minute, then add the prawns and stir-fry for five or so minutes, until nearly all the shells have turned bright pink – leave the wok alone for 20 seconds at a time between stirring, so the prawns cook through.Add the soy sauce, ketchup and chilli powder, and stir-fry for a further two minutes, until the sauce thickens. Spoon on to a platter, garnish with the remaining spring onions and eat immediately.These recipes are edited extracts from Simply Malaysian: Everyday Dishes to Cook at Home, by Mandy Yin, published later this month by Quadrille at £27.

Then come the sheetmasks: two under the eyes, one across the whole face, and perhaps another for the neck. A silk bonnet is placed over the hair, a chinstrap wraps the jaw and, as a final touch, a cartoonish, lip-shaped sticker is placed over the mouth, sealing it shut. And that’s the simplified version.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Welcome to the tyranny of #morningshed, the viral TikTok trend in which creators apply multiple, increasingly absurd layers of skincare products, masks and accessories before bed, hoping to uncover a flawless complexion when they peel them away the following morning. We aren’t talking about the (comparatively simple) serums and essences that made up the once-popular 12-step Korean-inspired routines. Now, it’s chinstraps to “lift” the jawline, hydrogel masksinfused with “ultra-low molecular collagen”to smooth, and adhesive tape applied to the skin to restrict wrinkling. I was going to liken it to Patrick Bateman’s morning routine in American Psycho, buthaving rewatched that scene, his gel cleanser, exfoliating scrub and face mask ritual feels decidedly lower maintenance.According to Dr Anjali Mahto, consultant dermatologist and founder of theSelf Londonclinic, the morning shedding trend is based more on performative productivity than it is skincare science. “There is growing pressure to curate every aspect of modern life – to present not just a polished appearance, but a polished process,” she says. “Skincare has not been spared, and these increasingly complex night-time rituals often go beyond what the skin physiologically requires, and instead reflect a broader cultural compulsion toward perfection.”View image in fullscreenPerformative productivity … #morningshed advocates use mouth tape to encourage nose breathing.Photograph: The Skinny ConfidentialThere’s something pretty dystopian about the image of these young women rising mummy-like from their beds – where presumably they have to sleep on their backs to ensure their masks, straps and gadgets stay in place – to begin the laborious process of “shedding” each morning. And the more formidable the routine, the more views the video gets. As TikTok creatorAshley Westdeclared to her 1 million followers: “The uglier you go to bed, the hotter you wake up” – a depressingly popular “affirmation” for the trend. And that’s before we even get on to the popularity ofmouth tape, which involves sealing your mouth shut to promote nose breathing instead – apparently resulting in better sleep and less snoring. Nose breathing can offer benefits, according toHarvard Health Publishing, but the organisation warns against using mouth tape to achieve it, citing “hampered breathing” and “significantly reduced” oxygen levels as potential risks. The symbolism is almost too on the nose. It feels as though, in many ways, we’re still as beholden to the idea of having to suffer for beauty as we ever were.Not only that, but is all of this effort actually achieving anything? Take face taping, a practice that uses kinesiology tape to restrict muscle movement and prevent lines forming in key areas such as between the eyebrows – referred to as 11 lines – the outer corners of the eyes, and between the nose and mouth. In theory, it sounds faintly plausible, but Mahto explains that the mechanisms of ageing are far more complex. “Wrinkles are not just about movement, they involve collagen loss, changes in fat distribution … Taping cannot reverse or prevent those processes.” What it can do is irritate the skin, she says, especially with repeated application. “At best, it offers a fleeting sense of control. At worst, it disrupts the barrier and causes unnecessary inflammation.”Dermatologists are similarly dismissive of single-use collagen gel masks, which appear opaque white on application but are transparent by morning, when the ingredients are said to have absorbed into the skin.“Not only is there an environmental impact, but there’s also no solid evidence that applying collagen topically replenishes the body’s own collagen stores,” says consultant dermatologist Dr Cristina Psomadakis, who is the medical director of prescription skincare brand Klira. And don’t get her started on the cocktail of different serums influencers layer on underneath the masks – retinoids, acids and other powerful actives applied with an alarmingly liberal hand. “I think most dermatologists will tell you the biggest problem they see is people overdoing it by following skin trends, or layering on products that should not be combined.”In many ways, it’s human nature to be drawn to products and rituals presented as offering an instant transformative effect. The skincare industry isn’tbooming for nothing. But as always, it’s the slightly boring but ultimately reassuring less-is-more approach that actually works. “The best thing you can do at night is wash off the remains of the day, including your face sunscreen, or makeup that can clog your pores,” says Psomadakis. “Most dermatologists have a very simple skincare routine consisting of a cleanser, moisturiser, sunscreen, and usually a prescription treatment at night.”The idea of having separate products for day and night is not all marketing spin, according to Mahto. “At night, the skin becomes more permeable, meaning it absorbs active ingredients more efficiently. Blood flow increases, repair processes accelerate, and water loss peaks,” she says. “So yes, there is some genuine science behind using particular products in the evening. Anything that increases skin sensitivity, like retinoids or exfoliating acids, is usually better applied at night, when the skin is not being exposed to UV or environmental pollutants.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here, colossal stone heads of ancient gods and kings gaze silently across the highlands, remnants of a long-lost kingdom. As the first rays of dawn paint the statues gold, visitors are transported into an almost mythic realm. Begin your journey in Gaziantep, often called Turkey’s culinary capital. Savour rich baklava and spicy kebabs before setting out through the hills toward Nemrut. After experiencing the mountain’s majesty, continue to Göbekli Tepe – considered the world’s oldest temple complex, predating Stonehenge by millennia.Ickin VuralJoin the locals and eat at a büfeView image in fullscreenAbüfeis perfect for visitors on a budget.Photograph: Khaled ElAdawy/AlamyIt’s become a little more expensive in Turkey recently, so my tip is: eat at thebüfeler, where the taxi drivers eat. You find them at every bus station in every town and village. A light lunch of rice withkuru fasulye(beans) on top, perhaps a side of vegetable stew (despite all those kebab shops, Turkish people don’t eat as much meat as we like to think), and anayran(yoghurt drink) on the side would be my idea of a perfect lunch.Afiyet olsun!(enjoy your meal), as they say in Turkey.AnnaProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Its name (“old city”) is a clue to the age of the place – it was founded around 1,000BC – but unlike some of the much more visited ruins and ancient cities in Turkey, it is very much a forward-looking, 21st-century place. The Odunpazarı houses in the oldest part of the city are beautifully multicoloured – it is a perfect area to enjoy an obligatory Turkish coffee and piece oflokum(Turkish delight).Michael KuipersAuthentic Turkish charmers near EphesusView image in fullscreenThe thermal pools at Pamukkale.Photograph: Jan Wlodarczyk/AlamyDiscover two gems nearexquisite Ephesus: Alaçatı, on the coast near İzmir, is a picturesque, sleepy village complete with fresh fish restaurants and sandy beaches; a bit further south is Şirince, a beautiful flower village that stays fresh even through July heatwaves. You can explore the coast, visit thermal baths in spectacular Pamukkale, and Ilıca, or head to the Greek island of Samos for the day, while still savouring the joy of a simpler and more authentic Turkey.ThomasLesser visited Lycian ruins around KaşView image in fullscreenThe ruins of Phellos near Kaş.Photograph: Valerii Shanin/AlamyJust above the popular seaside town of Kaş, tucked high in the hills, lie the ancient ruins of Phellos. The steep hike can be tough – especially in the heat – but the reward is worth it. Massive Lycian tombs and weathered stone ruins appear unexpectedly, like a scene from Indiana Jones. With no crowds or noise, it’s an off-the-beaten-track adventure into ancient history. If you’re seeking something beyond beaches and tourist spots, Phellos offers solitude, mystery and a stunning glimpse into a forgotten world.Pinar GreenwoodMardin’s heady mix and sweeping viewsView image in fullscreenMardin has views to Syria.Photograph: Tminaz/AlamyMy top secret Turkey tip would be Mardin, in the south-east. Honey-coloured houses on a hilltop cascade down to the Mesopotamian plateau, and just about every hotel has a terrace with sweeping views across to Syria.

A short taxi or bus ride will transport you from the bustling seaside town to a cascading waterfall which flows from the Taurus mountains to the Mediterranean Sea. Trees and natural vegetation provide shelter from the searing summer sun, while the waterside restaurants offer traditional Turkish food and drinks. Relax at tables nestled in the trees, perch at the water’s edge, or take a dip in a pool filled with icy mountain water – if you dare!NataliePaddling off the Lycian coast from FethiyeView image in fullscreenSea kayaking off the coast of Turkey.Photograph: Hocus Focus/Getty ImagesSea kayaking along Turkey’s wild south-west coast from Fethiye is an unforgettable experience. Paddle past hidden coves, ancient ruins and dramatic cliffs, before friendly local guides prepare delicious traditional Turkish meals, and the sunsets glow deep red over crystal waters. Fethiye is a culturally rich town nestled between mountains and the sea, and the perfect launch point for a trip. If you’re after beauty, solitude and authentic connection, this is paradise.MikeyHike to stunning ancient TermessosView image in fullscreenThe ruins of the theatre at Termessos.Photograph: Ian Dagnall/AlamyWe visited Antalya in February, and viewing some of the ancient sites on a crisp, sunny day with snow on the mountains in the background was brilliant. But the highlight of our trip was taking a hike in the Mount Güllük-Termessos national park to see the ancient Solymi city of Termessos, and particularly the stunning theatre, set atop the mountain with panoramic views. You pass many interesting ruins on the way up, but this is the jewel in the crown. We went on our own, but if you want to make a day of it I’d suggest joining a hiking group for an in-depth exploration.AlisonWinning tip: timeless charm at AkyakaView image in fullscreenAkyaka village and the Azmak River.Photograph: AlamyOn a spontaneous road trip through Turkey’s south-west, I stumbled upon Akyaka – a peaceful, pine-fringed village untouched by mass tourism. The Azmak River, so clear it seemed unreal, flowed past riverside cafes where I watched turtles drift by. Locals welcomed me like family, and evenings meant fresh seafood and golden sunsets. The architecture – wooden houses with carved balconies – gave the town a timeless charm. Paddleboarding on the calm sea at sunrise was a moment I’ll never forget.Debbie SkudraView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsTurkey holidaysReaders' travel tipsBeach holidaysCultural tripsTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, when McChlery’s sister was diagnosed with young-onset dementia, they had to rethink their plans.“The prospect and implications of supporting my sister-in-law became a key consideration,” says McConnachie, “and we decided to build a home closer to the facilities of the city so she could live with us and be closer to extended family.”McConnachie embarked on a tour of Scotland’s lochs, but after making a pitstop at Comrie in Perthshire on a sunny day he passed a “for sale” sign on the way out of the village that piqued his interest.“Looking at the cottage from the street it was tiny and worn, but to the rear was a lovely south-facing garden that backs on to the River Earn,” says McConnachie. Excited, he brought McChlery and her sister for a viewing. They both saw potential in the property and were charmed by the bustling village with its valley views and thriving community.View image in fullscreenThe master bedroom is light-filled and peaceful, with views of the hills and countrysideLast used as a dental surgery, the 18th-century cottage didn’t have any insulation and suffered from water damage and structural decay. McConnachie, who trained as an architect, embraced the challenge of transforming it into a warm and adaptable home that could also accommodate extended family. “We wanted the house to remain flexible and welcoming as a family hub, while also ensuring Frances’s sister felt safe, independent and engaged,” he says.McConnachie sought guidance from architecture firmLoader Monteithon maximising the layout, navigating conservation area restrictions and incorporating dementia-friendly design principles. For example, accessible kitchen shelving to allow her sister to navigate the space with some independence and open views through living spaces, so she feels connected but not surveilled.“The floorplan was very deep,” says director Matt Loader, “so we split the ground floor into three sections so it didn’t feel like you were in one long corridor.” He wanted to respect the “honesty” of the original cottage, so the front two rooms were maintained as cosy living spaces, each with its own fireplace and lime-plastered walls.View image in fullscreenJim and Frances in the kitchen, which has a low island where Frances and her sister can work togetherThe kitchen is at the heart of the home, with a small courtyard – affectionately named the “sit-ootery” – providing a sheltered spot for morning coffee. “The relationship between Frances and her sister is rooted in cooking, baking and gardening, so the kitchen and its connection to the outside spaces was key,” adds Loader.A defining feature is the marble-topped island, crafted from a piece of stone passed down through the family. As both sisters are short, “the island was set low to allow Frances’s sister to help with baking and food preparation, which is an important occupational therapy”, says McConnachie.Objects of historical significance can help people with Alzheimer’s retain a sense of familiarityWithin the new double-height extension at the rear is a generous living area and dining space overlooking the garden and riverside beyond. The views are framed by a huge picture window and a perforated pergola, which shelters the concrete bench below while letting dappled sunlight through.Seating “neuks” are a recurring theme; upstairs is a thoughtfully positioned window seat surrounded by shelves displaying “memory anchors”. Loader says: “Housing artefacts that hold historical significance can help those with Alzheimer’s recognise that this is their home, and it’s important to retain that sense of familiarity.”View image in fullscreenThe cottage’s south-facing garden backs on to the River EarnMcChlrey’s sister’s living quarters have been sensitively designed to cater for her needs without making it feel at odds with the rest of the house. The upstairs landing also includes a small servery, complete with sink and washing machine, that is designed to facilitate social interaction while also aiding practical care. Her bedroom is light and tranquil, with a dual aspect looking out to the hills beyond, while the couple’s master suite also benefits from stunning countryside views.The house’s pared-back aesthetic belies the forethought that has gone into this project to ensure it continues to meet the couple’s needs. For example, on the ground floor, thefront of the cottage is currently a home office on one side and a sitting room on the other, each with full-width sliding doors and sofa beds so they can be transformed into sleeping spaces when family visit or permanently if need be later.One of the biggest benefits of the layout, McChlery has discovered, is its “intervisibility”, allowing her to keep an eye on her sister without making her feel she is under supervision. “The deterioration of people with Alzheimer’s isn’t predictable,” says McConnachie. “The best-laid plans to leave clear space and simple-to-use facilities to allow for independence can be quickly taken over by the continuing onset of the condition, so it’s worth allowing space for supervised sharing tasks.” McConnachie ensured they left room for the introduction of fittings such as stair lifts and bathroom aids, as well as planning a simple and level route through the house – you can get from the front door to the garden without a step.“Caring for another adult with dementia is very difficult emotionally and physically – the grief and injustice are always in the back of your mind,” adds McChlery. “Everything about this house helps – it provides a beautiful and safe space that enables us allto be at home for as long as possible.”View image in fullscreenStaircases were made wide enough for a stair lift to be fitted later if neededExplore more on these topicsInteriorsHomesHome improvementsPropertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve only ever gardened in cities, and I’ve lived in them for more than half my life, but my rural roots show when it comes to foxgloves. They are steeped in the lore of Beatrix Potter illustrations and the first warm walks of the year down country lanes. Because they typically bloom in May, it’s rare to see a Chelsea flower show without any, and it’s here I’ve learned that these quintessential cottage garden flowers work just as well in contemporary urban gardens, where some varieties can be cajoled into a container and relish the part-shade often found in built-up areas.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When I first started gardening, I was baffled by the distinction between annuals and perennials, and ashamed to say so. For the uninitiated, annuals begin and end their lifecycle (growing from seed, flowering, setting seed and dying) in a year, while perennials return in subsequent years, sometimes bulking up or waning, depending on their longevity and the growing conditions. Then there are biennials, which complete their lifecycle over two years, and this is the group most foxgloves belong to. That means that if you want flowers next year, you’re nearing your last chance to sow them. They will put down roots and create a rosette of green leaves by Christmas, before sending up flower spikes, blooming and setting seeds next summer.If you find traditional foxgloves a bit blousy, try irresistibly tasteful ochre, rusty brown and orange varietiesAs anyone who is fortunate enough to have a crop of foxgloves in their garden can attest, these wildflowers can be particularly efficient self-seeders. When the conditions are right, they’ll set seed from late spring to late summer as their flowers go over. They particularly like the drifting, dappled shade of overhead trees, and these are the conditions you can emulate if you want to sow direct into the ground. For those who want to indulge in seed trays and tamping down, you can also grow foxgloves in pots and plant them in their for ever homes when they are bigger and it is cooler.If you can’t be bothered to sow, you can order plants now to establish later this year. But before you do anything, it’s important to note that all parts of foxgloves are toxic (including stems and leaves), so they may not be the right choice for your garden if you have animals or small children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I hope the children’s commissioner’s report (Children in England ‘living in almost Dickensian levels of poverty’, 8 July) is a moment for everyone to reflect on what the “ups and downs” of life look like for too many young people: going without food, cold and mouldy homes, and not feeling safe in the area you live.There is a toxic relationship between poverty and mental health. A fact reinforced by the latest NHS data, showing that mental health problems among adults are at record levels, with people in the most deprived areas hardest hit.Asthe reportitself cites, young people are understandably concerned about waits for mental health treatment. And with good reason – 35,000 young people have been waiting for more than two years for mental health support. Tackling mental health waiting lists and drivers of poor mental health must now be a priority for this government.Dr Sarah HughesCEO, MindMany readers must have been shocked by the report that children in the UK are living in “almost Dickensian levels of poverty”. Abolishing the two-child limit on benefits would lift many out of poverty. The cost of doing this has been estimated by the Resolution Foundation as £3.5bn. This may seem a lot. However, every year£23bn of benefitsgo unclaimed, according to Policy in Practice. Why not use this money? It would benefit the children, their families and the places in which they live.Jan PahlProfessor emeritus of social policy, University of KentHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is a difficult read, and yet I thought that Jackson wrote about her experiences with compassion for both patients and staff unwittingly caught up in erratic and overstretched services.I am a doctor, with experience as a psychiatric patient and as a senior “staff grade” doctor on an acute psychiatric ward.My memoir, Unshackled Mind: A Doctor’s Story of Trauma, Liberation and Healing, confirms Jackson’s claims that abuses do happen in these places. More subtly, there is a continued reliance on the disease-centred model of biomedical psychiatry without sufficient attention paid to the circumstances and adversities suffered by patients before they ever came in contact with psychiatry. As a result, my own early trauma was unaddressed for more than 20 years, while I was subjected to increasingly damaging interventions, including electroconvulsive therapy and even a cingulotomy. It is only since leaving psychiatry that I have been able to recover.Jackson’s book is a reminder that despite the best intentions, many patients are failing to get the help they need in a fundamentally flawed psychiatric system.Dr Cathy WieldAbingdon, OxfordshireI am writing to congratulate Dr Rachel Clarke for her excellent rebuttal of Bella Jackson’s assault on the failings of modern psychiatry. I have worked as the head of mental health law for a largeNHStrust for 35 years, and as a frequent visitor to mental health wards, entirely agree that Jackson’s views are at odds with my experience. I was last on a secure, forensic mental health ward just a few days ago – with incredibly challenging patients.All the staff I encountered were not only humane, but kind, compassionate and caring. I’ve also worked in roles where I visited many hospitals and have almost without exception experienced the same. Our mental health nurses and psychiatrists, as well as so many others, go out of their way to display the same values.I am far from naive, and recognise that there is a tiny minority of individuals who fail to live up to the same core values. Over decades I have witnessed interactions where psychiatrists, nurses and others are challenged to a degree that might seem almost impossible to cope with, but they rise to the challenge with great skill, kindness and compassion, in line with their respective professional codes of conduct.Kevin TowersHead of mental health law and data protection officer, West London NHS TrustI’m writing in response to the review by Rachel Clarke, especially the suggestion that the memoir is “scaremongering”. I am a consultant clinical psychologist with more than 20 years’ experience in the NHS across several London-based trusts. I train people, including ward staff and crisis services, in working effectively with people with personality disorder. Similar stories to those that Bella Jackson relates are reported to me and colleagues regularly. I don’t doubt the veracity of Jackson’s complaint, nor that NHS mental health is in a dire state; it is interesting that Clarke does, given her admission of relatively scant mental health experience.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Imagine what we would hear today instead, 7 July). That sense of acceptance and solidarity is part of what drew me to London in the first place. I understand the frustration some feel towards the so-called “London bubble” or “metropolitan elite”, but this city remains a place where people from all backgrounds can feel celebrated and connected.While I understand the point Hugh Muir makes in his piece, Livingstone’s message still resonates today with our current mayor.Sadiq Khancontinues to champion London’s diversity as a source of strength. You can’t travel a stop on the underground without seeing a poster from the mayor’s office proclaiming: “You are welcome”.He remains a leading voice for doing what he believes is right, whether through messages of unity or by pushing forward policies that may be unpopular, like Ulez, but ultimately benefit the majority of Londoners. Sadiq is by no means perfect, but at a time when Labour’s guiding compass appears to be crumbling under Keir Starmer’s weak leadership, it is heartening to have a mayor who still carries forward the inclusive message Livingstone delivered so powerfully two decades ago.Jackson BylettLondonThank you, Hugh Muir, for reminding me what we have lost in the last 20 years and that it is vital we do our utmost to build and celebrate diverse communities. Let’s display enthusiasm for and interest in others and – if we can’t do that – let us at the very least show tolerance for our fellow human beings.

You cite embarrassment and pain as major barriers to improving screening, but the misogyny of healthcare is of crucial importance.Women wait months to see gynaecologists then are given no pain relief for painful procedures. They put up with this as they don’t want to be put back in a queue. There is access to topical lidocaine spray and entonox, and it should be routine. Having just retired after 43 years as a women’s health nurse and midwife, my practical tips for women are: always ask for a small speculum dipped in water. They are less painful and water does not alter results (GP surgeries seem to use long speculum as routine. I never found one necessary, sizing down is the key to finding a cervix). Never agree to put your hands underneath you to help the practitioner. This is a red flag for a wrong-sized speculum, especially if the woman has a retroverted uterus. You don’t have a problem, the practitioner does. Please get screened, but expect kindness as a basic requirement.Elspeth SewellPrinces Risborough, BuckinghamshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is a 950-page historical novel that she describes as “the history of Brazil told from the point of view of a Black woman”.Recently selected asthe greatest work of Brazilian literature of the 21st century so farby the newspaper Folha de S Paulo, the book achieved the rare combination of both critical and popular success, with more than 180,000 copies sold since its release in 2006.Celebrating Gonçalves’s victory, Lula wrote that the book was his “companion” during his 580 days in prison, “and I always make a point of recommending it to everyone.”Now, the author hopes that her election to the 128-year-old academy – whose primary mission is the preservation of the Portuguese language and Brazilian literature – may help correct what she sees as a longstanding historical injustice.“I’m the first Black woman, but I can’t be the only one,” said Gonçalves, who will be just the sixth woman among the 40 members, or “immortals”, as they refer to themselves. Apart from two Black men and thefirst and only Indigenous writerto join the institution, all the others are white men.“I can’t carry the weight of representing an entire population that continues to be marginalised and that is itself incredibly diverse,” she said.The academy had as its first president a Black man, Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, widely considered the greatest Brazilian writer of all time. Despite still being known as the House of Machado de Assis, the academy has since had only a handful of other Black men as members – something many see as a stark illustration of howracism operatesin a country where more than half the population is of African descent.Poet and translatorStephanie Borges, 40, believes Gonçalves’s election will encourage more Black women to become readers and writers. “When it’s us telling our own stories, we invite those who look like us to come closer to literature,” she said.Cidinha da Silva, 58,author of more than 20 books, is keen to stress that Gonçalves was not elected because she is Black, but “because she is one of the greatest living writers in Brazil”.There were 13 candidates in the running, and of the 31 members who voted in Thursday’s election, 30 chose Gonçalves – the remaining vote went toEliane Potiguara, 74, who had hoped to become the first Indigenous woman to join the academy.Gonçalves had to run a sort of “campaign” – though she emphasises she never asked for votes – in which she sent a copy of her book and a personal letter to each member, and phoned some of them to discuss her work.In 2018, another celebrated Black writer,Conceição Evaristo, 78, also stood for election, but received just one vote.“The academy does need more women, more Black people, Indigenous people, and people from other parts of Brazil,” said Gonçalves. “And I hope that now, from the inside, I can help make that happen.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He resigned as chief executive of the company at the center of the case, Oak View Group (OVG), after the announcement.Spokespeople for Leiweke, 68, issued a statement maintaining he had “done nothing wrong and will vigorously defend himself and his well-deserved reputation for fairness and integrity”.Investigators allege that Leiweke spent a period from February 2018 to at least June 2024 conspiring with a competitor’s CEO to “rig the bidding for the development, management and use” of the Moody Center, at the University ofTexasat Austin.Leiweke allegedly struck a deal that the rival firm would agreed to avoid bidding on the Moody Center in exchange for OVG providing it with the project’s subcontracts.OVG went on to construct the building after submitting the sole bid and the Moody Center opened in 2022. The company “continues to receive significant revenues from the project to date”, the US justice department said in a statement.Leiweke could face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $1m or more if convicted.A statement from Abigail Slater, an assistant attorney general at the justice department’s antitrust division, accused Leiweke of having “deprived a public university and taxpayers of the benefits of competitive bidding” to boost his company’s bottom line. She said federal officials would always strive “to hold executives who cheat to avoid competition accountable”.Christopher Raia of the FBI said in a statement that “public contracts are subject to laws requiring an open and competitive bid process to ensure a level playing field”, adding: “The FBI is determined to ensure those who disregard fair competition principles do not benefit from a rigged bidding process targeting our communities and public institutions.”Leiweke was president of the Nuggets from 1991 to 1995 before becoming CEO of the Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), whose holdings include the Los Angeles Kings hockey team and Los Angeles Galaxy soccer club. After leaving AEG in 2013, he was CEO and president of Canada-based MLSE, whose holdings include Toronto’s major sports franchises. He co-founded OVG, based in Denver, and became its CEO in 2015.Among OVG’s upcoming construction projects was a new arena at Louisiana State University (LSU). Officials at the university reportedly toldThe Advocatenewspaper that they are reviewing how the charges against Leiweke may affect the new arena project.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeTexasCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Its dramatic calving events, when massive blocks of ice crashed into Lago Argentino, became a symbol of natural wonder, drawing millions of visitors to southern Patagonia.DrLucas Ruiz, a glaciologist at the Argentine Institute of Nivology, Glaciology and Environmental Sciences, said: “The Perito Moreno is a very particular, exceptional glacier. Since records began, it stood out to the first explorers in the late 19th century because it showed no signs of retreat – on the contrary, it was advancing. And it continued to do so until 2018, when we began to see a different behaviour. Since then, its mass loss has become increasingly rapid.”Scientists and local guides warn that the balance is beginning to shift. “The first year the glacier didn’t return to its previous year’s position was 2022. The same happened in 2023, again in 2024, and now in 2025. The truth is, the retreat continues. The glacier keeps thinning, especially along its northern margin,” said Ruiz. This sector is the farthest from tourist walkways and lies above the deepest part of Lago Argentino, the largest freshwater lake in Argentina.View image in fullscreenCalving events at Perito Moreno, when ice collapses into the lake, are becoming louder, more frequent, and much larger.Photograph: Philipp Rohner/Getty Images/500pxThe summer of 2023-24 recorded a maximum temperature of 11.2C, according to meteorological data collected byPedro Skvarca, a geophysical engineer and the scientific director of the Glaciarium centre in El Calafate, Patagonia. Over the past 30 years, the average summer temperature rose by 1.2C, a change significant enough to greatly accelerate ice melt.Ice thickness measurements are equally alarming. Between 2018 and 2022, the glacier was thinning at a rate of 4 metres a year. But in the past two years, that has doubled to 8 metres annually.“Perito Moreno’s size no longer matches the current climate; it’s simply too big. It can’t withstand the heat, and the current ice input isn’t enough to compensate,” Ruiz said.Ice that once rested on the lakebed owing to its weight, said Ruiz, had now thinned so much that it was beginning to float, as water pressure overtook the ice’s own.With that anchor lost, the glacier’s front accelerates – not because of increased mass input from the accumulation zone, where snow compacts into ice, but because the front slides and deforms. This movement triggers a feedback loop that further weakens the structure, making the process potentially irreversible.Xabier Blanch Gorriz, a professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, who studies ice calving at the Perito Moreno glacier front, said: “Describing the change as ‘irreversible’ is complex, because glaciers are dynamic systems. But the truth is that the current rate of retreat points to a clearly negative trend.” He added: “The glacier’s retreat and thinning are evident and have accelerated.”Ruiz confirmed another disturbing trend reported by local guides: calving events are becoming louder, more frequent, and much larger. In April, a guide atLos Glaciares national parkdescribed watching a tower of ice the height of a 20-storey building collapse into the lake. “It’s only in the last four to six years that we’ve started seeing icebergs this size,” he told Reuters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Initial comparisons between December and June already reveal significant ice loss. Satellite images further highlight a striking retreat over just 100 days.Today, nothing seems capable of halting the glacier’s retreat. Only a series of cooler summers and wetter winters might slow the trend, but climate projections point in the opposite direction.“What we expect is that, at some point, Perito Moreno will lose contact with the Magallanes peninsula, which has historically acted as a stabilising buttress and slowed the glacier’s response to climate change. When that happens, we’ll likely see a catastrophic retreat to a new equilibrium position, farther back in the narrow valley,” said Ruiz.Such a shift would represent a “new configuration” of the glacier, raising scientific questions about how this natural wonder would behave in the future. “It will be something never seen before – even farther back than what the first researchers documented in the late 19th century,” Ruiz nadded.How long the glacier might hold that future position remains unknown. But what scientists do know is that the valley, unlike the Magallanes peninsula, would not be able to hold the glacier in place.Perito Moreno – Latin America’s most iconic glacier and part of a Unesco world heritage site since 1981 – now joins a regrettable local trend: its neighbours, the Upsala and Viedma glaciers, have retreated at an astonishing rate over the past two decades. It is also part of a global pattern in which, as Ruiz put it, humanity is “digging the grave” of the world’s glaciers.Explore more on these topicsGlaciersArgentinaClimate crisisAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

There were no drugs onboard this time, but most notably, there were no traffickers.Last week, the Colombian navy announced that it had seized an “autonomous semisubmersible”, the first seizure of such a vessel in the country’s waters.Detected near Santa Marta, off Colombia’s Caribbean coast, the small grey vessel was equipped with antennas and a Starlink modem. Two surveillance cameras were also installed: one on the bow, providing a real-time view of the craft’s trajectory and obstacles, and another inside to monitor the engine and transmission. Officials believe the uncrewed sub was on a trial run to transport cocaine to the United States or Europe.“The discovery reflects a migration toward more sophisticated unmanned systems that increase evasion capabilities, and which pose a growing challenge to international maritime security,” said Adm Juan Ricardo Rozo Obregón, commander of the Colombian navy.‘I had 30 Lamborghinis’: Pablo Escobar’s top cocaine pilot gives first interviewRead moreThe navy has warned that autonomous technologies are “an emerging threat that is transforming the transnational criminal landscape”, and said that it believed the vessel was operated by the Gulf Clan, Colombia’s largest drug-trafficking group.The discovery comes as Colombia – the world’s leading cocaine producer – faces record-high production of the drug, fuelled by surging global demand. The country’s estimated coca leaf cultivation increased from 204,000 to 253,000 hectares (504,000 to 625,000 acres) in 2023, according to theUnited Nations.While traffickers have used crewed semisubmersibles for decades, the recent advent of the uncrewed vessels shows that gangs are making significant technological advances. They are also seeking new ways to eliminate the risk of captured operators cooperating with authorities.“It’s definitely a sign of how creative traffickers are becoming, and how ‘narco subs’ have evolved significantly in both design and technology,” said Henry Shuldiner, an investigator at the InSight Crime thinktank, who co-authored a report on the rise of narco subs. “This unmanned model seems like the next step in that evolution.”Shuldiner said that traffickers were testing whether removing crews – which typically involve at least four people, particularly for long transatlantic journeys – could make the lucrative trade more efficient.“The fact that this appeared to be a test run shows traffickers are willing to invest in research and development, even if that means losing a vessel to authorities,” he said. Building a semisubmersible can cost as little as $150,000, thoughmost estimatesplace the cost between $1m and $2m.Juana Cabezas, a researcher at Colombia’s Institute for Development and Peace Studies,toldAFP that Mexican drug cartels, which operate in Colombia, began “hiring technology experts and engineers to develop an unmanned submarine” as far back as 2017, adding that drone vessels made it harder for the authorities to identify those behind the shipments.Colombian law punishes the use, construction, possession and transportation of semisubmersibles with penalties of up to 14 years in prison.Nonetheless, a near-record number of the low-profile vessels were intercepted crossing the Atlantic and Pacific in 2024,according to InSight Crime.“In some years, we’ve seen 30 or more interdictions globally. And that’s just the ones we know about,” said Shuldiner. “Some US officials estimate that only around 5% of these vessels actually get caught. So even with near-record seizures in 2024, most are still slipping through.”While most cocaine is still smuggled on container ships, narco subs are playing a growing role, especially for long-haul, transoceanic routes, he added.The Colombian navy said that in the first half of 2025, 10 semisubmersibles were detected in different regions of the continent, all adapted to make them difficult to track by radar, and even mobilise with partial autonomy.Sergio Guzmán, the director of Colombia Risk Analysis, said that while this marks the first capture in Colombian waters, it is most likely not the first deployment. “The authorities are one step behind the criminals when it comes to these things,” he said.He warned it would be “very difficult” for Colombia and other governments to “keep up” unless countries improve information sharing and cooperation.Globally,cocaine productionsoared by nearly 34% in 2023 compared with the previous year, while an estimated 25 million people used the drug, up from 17 million a decade earlier.Explore more on these topicsColombiaDrugs tradeAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

2025 10.32 EDTFirst published on Thu 10 Jul 2025 21.24 EDTShareEven as they face among the most punitive tariffs globally, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has sought to reassure south-east Asian countries of Washington’s commitment to the region, saying they may get “better” trade deals than the rest of the world.In his first official visit to Asia, Rubio met the foreign ministers of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) inMalaysiaon Thursday, telling his counterparts that the US had “no intention of abandoning” the region.His visit came days after Donald Trump renewed his threat to impose severe tariffson many south-east Asian countries if they did not strike deals by 1 August.US shoppers feel the heat of Trump’s trade war: ‘the prices are going up’Read moreThe region, which includes countries that rely on exports and manufacturing, has been among the worst hit by Trump’s trade war.Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia, the Philippines and Indonesia weresent letters this weekwarning they would face tariffs ranging from 20-40% – levies that Rubio said were being discussed with Asean countries.“I would say that when all is said and done, many of the countries in south-east Asia are going to have tariff rates that are actually better than countries in other parts of the world,” Rubio said.View image in fullscreenMarco Rubio meets with Malaysia’s prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim.Photograph: Mandel Ngan/ReutersBefore Rubio’s arrival in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, condemned the tariffs, saying the levies were not a “passing storm” but instead “the new weather of our time”.Tools once used to generate growth were now being “wielded to pressure, isolate and contain”, Anwar said.The looming tariffs have cast a shadow over Rubio’s trip, even as he sought to underline the importance of south-east Asia to the US.“It is our view, our strong view, and the reality that this century and the next, the story of the next 50 years, will largely be written here in this region, in this part of the world,” he said.In a joint communique on Friday, Asean foreign ministers condemned unilateral tariffs as “counterproductive and risk exacerbating global economic fragmentation”, though they did not mention the US directly.Stephen Olson, a visiting senior fellow at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said Rubio had the unenviable position of trying to reassure south-east Asian partners that US continued to be committed to the region and to free and open trade relations when all the evidence pointed to the opposite.“Asean ministers will give him a polite and respectful reception but are unlikely to be fundamentally persuaded by anything he says,” added Olson.Rubio had his first in-person talks with the Chinese foreign minister,Wang Yi, at the gathering on Friday, which he described as “positive and constructive”, though he stressed their meeting was not a negotiation.Questions over Washington’s commitment to the region coupled with Trump’s unpredictable economic polices could be a boon for China.At the same gathering, China and Asean, which is China’s largest trading partner, completed negotiations to further refine their free trade area to include additional industries.View image in fullscreenRepresentatives attending the Asean foreign ministers meeting.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockIn meetings with Asean countries, Wang sought to draw a contrast between Washington and Beijing – presenting China as a reliable partner interested in mutual development.During a meeting with Cambodia’s deputy prime minister, Prak Sokhonn, he said the US levies were “an attempt to deprive all parties of their legitimate right to development”.“In the face of turbulent global situation, China is willing to be Cambodia’s trustworthy and reliable friend and partner,” Wang added.Wang told his Thai counterpart, Maris Sangiampongsa, the US was “abusing tariffs, wrecking the free trade system and disrupting the stability of the global supply chain”, according the Chinese foreign ministry.In another sign of the economic recalibration, the Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, told a television news programme that Japan needed to wean itself from US dependence in key areas.“If they think Japan ought to follow what America says as we depend heavily on them, then we need to work to become more self-sufficient in security, energy and food, and less dependent on America,” he said.Vietnam is the only Asian country, and the second globally, to reach a trade deal with the US. Under the agreement many goods will face atariff of 20% but a 40% levy will remain for so-called transshipments– a provision that is aimed at Chinese companies accused of passing their products through Vietnam to avoid tariffs.Trump’s agreement with Vietnam is seen by analysts as a sign he will use tariff negotiations to try topressure countries to cut China from their supply chains.South-east Asian countries have rushed to offer concessions to Trump to avert the tariffs, which could devastate economic growth.Levies loom over eight out of 10 Asean member states, including a tariff of 20% on the Philippines, 25% on Malaysia and Brunei, 32% onIndonesia, and 36% on Cambodia and Thailand. Laos and Myanmar, a country gripped by civil war, continue to face among the most severe tariffs globally, with a 40% levy.InThailand, if the government is unable to avert the 36% rate, growth in gross domestic product is expected to drop below 1% this year, according to analysis by the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.Bangkok has pledged to reduce its $46bn (£34bn) trade surplus with the US by 70% within five years and eliminate the imbalance within eight years.Officials in Indonesia, south-east Asia’s largest economy, were also reportedly shocked by the letters sent by the US, which came despite a recent pledge to increase imports from the US by $34bn.With agenciesExplore more on these topicsTariffsAsean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)ThailandMalaysiaIndonesiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The world was at his feet,” the blurb reads.“Then came the unexpected sabotage and political persecution from one individual. It began a spiral of destruction – finances, family, health and career. He almost lost it all.”Adams has since written several other books, including Retaking America: Crushing Political Correctness, Class Dismissed: Why College Isn’t the Answer, and The Most Dangerous President in History, which is about Joe Biden.The conservative US political commentator is the founder of Foundation for Liberty and American Greatness (FLAG), which describes itself as an “non-profit organization dedicated to promoting and providing high-quality civics education that informs students and families about the greatness of America and the power of the American Dream”.He also founded 1A Warriors, which he described as “a non-profit organization dedicated to securing, protecting, and preserving our beautiful and exceptional First Amendment”.Adams, who became a US citizen in 2021, was threatened with suspension from the Liberal party in Australia after an interaction with a journalist in 2009, but he later reportedly said he had quit the party prior.The then councillor was filmed verbally abusing the former Channel 10 journalist Brett Mason in 2009 after media reporting that accused Adams of missing council meetings.“I would just like to say that Brett Mason is a ******* good-for-nothing ****,” is how ABC’s Media Watch reported Adams’ words.Green Card Warrior: My Quest for Legal Immigration in an Illegals’ System by Nick Adams – digested readRead moreThe same episode, in 2010, said that Adams was running public relations for The Halloween Institute, which organised a “stunt” protest as part of a campaign to make Halloween a public holiday that would be “bigger than Christmas”.A 2009 statement from the NSW Liberal party state director Mark Neeham,in the local publication City Hub, said Adams’ actions in abusing the journalist had fallen “well below the standard expected of Liberal Party-endorsed councillors”.In 2005 the former deputy mayor on Sydney’s Ashfield councilproposed an eradication of the area’s pigeonsto prevent the spread of bird flu.“Ashfield should be inhospitable to pigeons,”he told the council. “Avian influenza does not respect borders … I’m not an expert. I’m not an accountant. I’m certainly not a pest controller. Don’t ask me about procedure. What I would like to see is no pigeons in our area.”Posting to his Substack after the nomination, Adams reflected on his early life diagnosis of stage four cancer, describing how “many thought that I would never live into adulthood at all”.In the post, which is almost 900 words long, Adams also addressed Trump directly, writing: “You are not only my favorite President, you are my favorite person.”Guardian Australia has approached Adams for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS newsDonald TrumpMalaysiaSydneyAustralian foreign policyAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

She also submitted a criminal complaint asking prosecutors to investigatecrimes against humanitycharges against Kim and five other officials.The filings at Seoul’s central district court and prosecutors’ office on Friday will representwhat supporters sayis the first time a North Korean defector has pursued legal action for the regime’s human rights violations in South Korean courts.North Korea executed man for distributing K-pop, report from defectors showsRead more“It’s been 13 years since I settled inSouth Koreabut I still suffer from severe PTSD from torture aftereffects and live dependent on medication,” Choi told the Guardian. “The scars on my entire body testify to the horrific reality of North Korean human rights.”Choi escapedNorth Koreain 1997 but was forcibly repatriated from China four times between 2000 and 2008. During her final repatriation in 2008, she spent five months detained across three facilities in North Hamgyong province.The complaints – seen by the Guardian – detail specific alleged incidents, including sexual assault during an unsanitary body cavity search without gloves, severe beatings that burst her right eardrum and left her unconscious, and systematic torture through forced stress positions lasting more than 15 hours daily.Among Choi’s lawyers is Lee Young-hyun, himself a North Korean defector who became the first North Korean-born lawyer qualified to practise in South Korea.The Database Centre for North Korean Human Rights (NKDB), which supported the case, plans to use it as a foundation for submissions toUN human rights bodiesand the international criminal court.“This case may serve as a precedent-setting moment in South Korean jurisprudence, as domestic courts have had little prior case law dealing with crimes against humanity,” said Seongyeop Lee, a human rights analyst at NKDB.“As other victims have also expressed interest in legal action, this case could lay the foundation for future collective lawsuits and contribute to broader accountability efforts.”Both filings name Kim Jong-un as a defendant bearing responsibility forthe alleged abuses. The criminal complaint argues he has command responsibility for systematic crimes against humanityunder the principlethat North Korean officials operate under the supreme leader’s “effective control”.The complaint draws heavily on the2014 UN commission of inquirythat found North Korea committed widespread crimes against humanity, including torture, sexual violence and arbitrary detention. The report documentedsystemic abusesin the country’s network of political prison camps, estimated to hold between 80,000 and 120,000 people.Previous civil lawsuits against North Korea include cases by former prisoners of war seeking compensation for forced labour, families of South Koreans abducted during the Korean war, and a 2023 case seeking damages for North Korea’sdestruction of an inter-Korean liaison office.In theory, South Korean courts can hear such cases because the country’s constitution considers North Korea part of Korean territory, rather than a separate sovereign state.The civil complaint lists North Korea’s UN mission in New York as the service address, since direct service to Pyongyang institutions is impossible.However, enforcement remains impossible as there is no mechanism to compel North Korea to pay damages even when plaintiffs win, making such victories largely symbolic.Joanna Hosaniak of the Citizens’ Alliance for North Korean Human Rights cautioned that crimes against humanity cases typically required multiple victims and extensive evidence of systematic patterns.“These are hugely complex legal proceedings that usually take years to build properly,” she said.But Choi remains undeterred. “We must act while survivors are still alive to testify,” she said.“This small step must become a cornerstone for freedom and human rights, so no more innocent North Koreans suffer under this brutal regime.“We are the living witnesses.”Explore more on these topicsNorth KoreaSouth KoreaAsia PacificKim Jong-unHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

According to some reports, they are apotential bargaining chipfrom a Trump administration seeking guarantees of support in any conflict over Taiwan.Albanese will take a business delegation to the cities of Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu for a six-day trip from Saturday. His official itinerary is about meeting business, tourism and sport representatives “to continue building on Australia’s strong economic and trade links with China”. That includes the Australia-China annual leaders’ meeting, attending a Shanghai soccer club with strong ties to Australia, a visit to the headquarters of Trip.com and likely a photo op with pandas.President Xi and Premier Li Qiang are on Albanese’s meeting list – whether Li repeats his warm praise from 2023 of Albanese as“a handsome boy coming from Australia”remains to be seen.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailAustralia’s two-way trade with China amounted to almost $312bn in 2024 – by far our biggest partner, the government has been keen to stress, noting Albanese’s success in overseeing the removal of $20bn in trade barriers and boosting exports of barley, lobster and beef. Efforts to “advance Australia’s security and economic interests” are the flavour of the trip, government sources say, and for the business delegation, led by the Business Council of Australia (BCA), that will be top of their list.Executives from banks, including ANZ and Macquarie, miners Rio Tinto and Fortescue, manufacturers BHP and BlueScope, and universities Monash and UNSW will join the prime minister’s trip. Heading their agenda is a CEO roundtable in Beijing, hosted by the China Development Bank, with an emphasis on green metals, research and development, education, finance, and clean energy.BCA CEO Bran Black said businesses were keen to find new opportunities with China, seeking “an even stronger relationship with our largest economic partner”.But advancing Australia’s security interests, as the government has also put at the top of its priority list, will call for a fine balancing act.The Coalition has urged Albanese to raise the circumnavigation of Australia by a Chinese naval taskforce and advocate further for the release ofdetained academic Yang Hengjun. Human Rights Watch, noting human rights were not listed on Albanese’s list of trip priorities, called on the prime minister to raise abuses in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the same breath, she praised China’s strength, saying its “size and weight makes it central to solving global challenges”.That Wong, intensely deliberate and the closest of Albanese’s confidantes, would make such remarks on the eve of his visit to China was no mistake. Albanese, asked about her statement on Friday, said Wong was doing “a fantastic job”.Wong’s speech, referencing the tensions between China and the United States, said, “Two countries can be the strongest of allies without agreeing on every single element of policy.” She said Canberra and Washington were “in complete agreement on the importance of the peace, stability and prosperity for the Indo-Pacific and for our peoples”.Albanese’s Beijing visit will not go unnoticed in the White House. Conservative criticism of the absence of a meeting with Trump has been overblown, and is unlikely to abate after a second meeting with Xi. But Albanese will toe a fine line as he pursues closer ties with China while continuing to strongly maintain to the US that Australia needs the Aukus submarines.Labor senator Raff Ciccone, chair of the parliament’s security committee, said on Friday that the two issues could coexist.“When there’s trade, when there’s dialogue, when there’s economic interests at play, what you do find is countries are less likely to engage in the worst case scenario, which is war, and we’re trying really [to] have those frank conversations,” he told the ABC.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyAnthony AlbaneseChinaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Net zero must be repealed and as such, I will, at my first opportunity bring forward a bill to do that,” he wrote.“The idea that, at this stage, we have put the focus of our nation on a lunatic crusade of Net Zero is treacherous to the very security of Australia.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThere’s no guarantee Joyce’s private member’s bill will be considered for debate if it is introduced in the upcoming sitting fortnight.It is also unlikely to attract the full support of the opposition, which was reduced to 43 seats of 150 after May’s federal election.The opposition is undertaking an internal review of its election policies, with climate change and energy expected to take centre-stage in an ideological tussle.Joyce and his Queensland colleague Matt Canavan have longcampaigned for the climate targetsto be ditched, while some Liberals, such as the shadow home affairs minister, Andrew Hastie, have expressed fresh scepticism about the goal.Joyce has previously labelled theestimated cost of net zero “utterly untenable”and urged the Coalition to walk away from the Paris agreement and its associated climate targets.The shadow energy minister, Dan Tehan,told Guardian Australia in Junethe financial cost to reach net zero by 2050 may shape the Coalition’s decision on whether it keeps the target.“The cost will be one of the most significant factors that will drive our decision,” Tehan said, accusing the government of obscuring the cost of signature climate policies, including the capacity investment scheme.Within the Nationals, Canavan is also conducting a review of the party’s policy on net zero, which is expected to take months.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bullivant and Habib were not among the 13 identified by the group.In a statement to the Guardian, Bullivant called the accusations a “smear campaign”.In its letter, Great British Pac calls for an end to any negotiations to return the Parthenon sculptures, also known as the Elgin marbles, or risk legal challenges.The campaigners refer to what they allege is a “covert negotiation”, citing an “accelerating campaign to remove the Elgin marbles from the British Museum”.Experts in archaeology and antiquities criticised the intervention. Dan Hicks, a professor of contemporary archaeology at the University of Oxford, said: “The accusation of a covert and accelerating campaign appears to be aimed at publicly appointed trustees, whereas in reality it is the structure, funding and identity of Great British Pac that is opaque and concerning.“Perhaps the signatories could explain who and what exactly this group is and who is paying for it. This letter is a desperate culture-warrior exercise in scaremongering and intimidation developed by undefined political actors.”He added: “International loans have been a normal part of the operation of museum exhibitions for more than a century. To give just one example, the British Museum itself will be the recipient of a high-profile loan from France next year when theBayeux tapestry will be put on display. Many will question why the UK’s national museums remain unable to make permanent returns of stolen cultural objects on a case-by-case basis, as other British museums are able to do.“And some, myself included, have been asking why national museum directors and trustees are not calling for a change in those antiquated 1960s laws. But to call into question the legality of making loans from Britain to an EU nation would be very odd indeed.”Christos Tsirogiannis, who heads illicit antiquities trafficking research for theUnesco chair on threats to cultural heritageat the Ionian University in Corfu, said: “While it is completely unacceptable that the public in both countries remains in the dark about the content of the negotiations, it was reported years ago in the British press that the majority of the British public supports the unconditional and permanent return of all the Parthenon sculptures to Greece.View image in fullscreenHorse head from the collection of Parthenon marbles that once decorated the temple on the Acropolis in Athens.Photograph: mauritius images GmbH/Alamy“In reality, this letter harms the interests of the British people and state, and disrupts the relationship between two traditional allies, bound by friendship and blood ties in two world wars. Both governments – not just the trustees of the British Museum – bear equal responsibility for reaching a historically just solution.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were removed between 1801 and 1815 by Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman empire, who claimed he had permission to take them, although no supporting document has been found. The sculptures were acquired by the British Museum in 1816, but their rightful ownership has been disputed since the 1980s.Last year, two months after Labour’s election victory, Giorgos Gerapetritis, the Greek foreign minister, told the Guardian he believed a deal was “relatively close”. Negotiations between Athens and the British Museum began in 2021.It has been reported that any possible agreement might be underpinned by a cultural partnership between the countries, with the sculptures being returned and reunited with other pieces on display at the Parthenon galleries of the Acropolis Museum in exchange for renowned artworks that could take centre stage at rolling exhibitions in London.Bullivant, also the editor of the Conservative & Reformer Post website, said: “Hope not Hate’s smear campaign is nothing new. It’s part of their tired old playbook: when they can’t win the argument, they try to delegitimise those who disagree.“We’re not a political party, we don’t take orders from anyone, and we firmly believe in free speech.”She added: “As for funding – let’s clear that up too. Hope not Hate seem obsessed with it. We are 100% grassroots. No shadowy donors. No foreign money. It doesn’t take a bank transfer to write a letter about the Elgin Marbles. You want to know who paid for the stamp? I did.”A spokesperson for the British Museum said: “Discussions withGreeceabout a Parthenon partnership are ongoing and constructive.“We believe that this kind of long-term partnership would strike the right balance between sharing our greatest objects with audiences around the world, and maintaining the integrity of the incredible collection we hold at the museum.”Explore more on these topicsParthenon marblesBritish MuseumGreeceHeritageMuseumsSculptureLiz TrussnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump has not previously approved packages of military aid to Ukraine.“So what we’re doing is the weapons that are going out are going to Nato, and then Nato is going to be giving those weapons [to Ukraine], and Nato is paying for those weapons,” Trump said, probably indicating that they would be purchased by countries that are members of the Nato security bloc. Administration officials have said this would be different from the US supplying Ukraine directly, as Nato and not Washington would be making the decision to arm Kyiv.Germany and other member states of the security bloc had spoken publicly about ongoing negotiations to purchase weapons from the United States to transfer to Ukraine.Ukraine is producing more modern weaponry including drones, but still relies on the US to supply everything from Patriot missiles to defend from nightly Russian missile and drone attacks, Himars long-range missiles to strike behind Russian lines, 155mm artillery shells and other munitions.The Axios news website said that some officials had said the US would only sell Ukraine “defensive” weapons, while others said the package could also include “offensive” weapons such as the Himars missiles.Yet a key stumbling block remains US military production. The US only has about 25% of the Patriot missile interceptors it needs for all of the Pentagon’s military plans, the Guardian revealed this month, and fulfilling new orders can take years depending on the priority level given to the contract.Kellogg is expected to address the US weapons shipments during his visit to Kyiv, the first since shortly after Trump’s inauguration.During the interview, Trump also endorsed the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, a bill introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally seen as a leader of Russia hawks in the legislature. Graham has said that the bill would impose “bone-breaking sanctions” on Putin and a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that buy Russian oil and other goods, potentially targeting China and India.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will have to be ratified by the commission and EU states, five of which – Italy, Spain, Malta, Cyprus and Greece – have criticised the deal.Steve Peers, a professor of EU law at Royal Holloway, University of London, said the commission could not realistically unpick the deal.“France is consulting, but even if it were that the commission thinks that this breaches EU law, then they can’t order France not to do it. France might say, ‘That’s interesting, we have a different view, we’re going to do it anyway’, and then it would be up to the commission to sue France,” he said.He said there was an example of the commission suing a member state about 10 years ago when a number of countries signed bilateral aviation treaties with the US. Outside of that, the case law made it “hard to tell” what the commission could or would do.Italy, Spain, Malta, Cyprus and Greece sent a joint letter to Brussels last month objecting to the deal at a time when the EU is trying to implement a hard-won piece of legislation taking a bloc-wide approach to asylum and migration.One diplomat from one of the five signatory nations said they understood that France had “to give something to the UK to satisfy public opinion” at a time when the entire EU wants to keep the British government tied into to future defence and security in the face of continued Russian aggression.But the diplomat said there was surprise at the content of the deal, which will start with the return of 50 people a week, one in 17 of the average weekly arrivals by small boats this year so far.“It is difficult to see why the French over-stepped the EU treaties without delivering something more spectacular,” they said. “We do want to help the British government to be engaged withEuropeand that is a priority, but I find it very difficult to see this agreement go smoothly because the French overstepped the mark.”Other nations say the deal with the UK is just “smoke and mirrors” because France can return migrants to the country of arrival under the EU’s Dublin rules. More than 21,000 migrants have made the Channel crossing in rudimentary vessels this year.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary,said on Fridayshe thought the commission would sign off on the pilot scheme.But a spokesperson for the commission on Friday said it would “assess the concrete modalities of this cooperation”.“We continue to work with France and the UK as well as other EU member states to support solutions that are compatible with the spirit and the letter of EU law,” he said. “What we have now is an announcement and a political agreement, in principle, to have a pilot agreement.“Once we know more about the substance and the form of that, we can tell you more about it, but we will look at this together with UK and France we will be working with all parties involved.”Many details of the scheme remain unclear, such as how many people will be returned, how those involved will be chosen and when it will start.Talking to LBC radio on Friday, Cooper said she did not expect the rollout to be delayed by opposition from Europe, despite Mediterranean countries’ concern about the prospects of returned asylum seekers travelling back to southern Europe.“We have been talking to the EU commissioners,” she said. “We’ve also been talking to other European interior ministers and governments throughout this process.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cooper said on Friday: “We’re actually not fixing the ultimate figures, either for the pilot or for any further phases.”Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “The numbers will be tiny. We will be allowing 94% of illegal immigrants to remain in the UK, which is no deterrent whatsoever.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionYvette CooperMigrationFranceKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

The sails will now rotate daily from 4pm to 2am.“The whole troupe is very happy to find our sails again – these are the sails of Paris,” said Cyrielle, one of the 60 dancers who took part in the street celebration, which was illuminated by a specially commissioned firework display.Founded in 1889, the Moulin Rouge became a global symbol offin-de-siècleParisian nightlife, its famed can-can dancers depicted in paintings by artists such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. An eponymous2001 film by Baz Luhrmanncemented its present-day appeal.The French can-can is believed to have evolved from the final figure of a dance for couples known as thequadrille.It caused considerable scandal when it first became popular as a cabaret act mainly because of its intentionally revealing high kicks.Performed by a line of female dancers, the dance, devised in the early 1920s by Pierre Sandrini, then artistic director of the Moulin Rouge, revolves around the “vigorous manipulation of skirts and petticoats, high kicks, jump splits and cartwheels”.After their collapse,new aluminium sailswere ready in time for the Paris Olympics last July, but it has taken almost a year to build and fit a new electric motor ready to turn them and power the hundreds of red and gold bulbs that stud the display.Explore more on these topicsParisCabaretFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The private company employs American mercenaries to oversee four food distribution zones, as opposed to the previous 400 non-militarised zones run under the UN system.The GHF said the UN figures were “false and misleading” and denied that deadly incidents occurred at its sites. “The fact is the most deadly attacks on aid sites have been linked to UN convoys,” a GHF spokesperson said.GHF also denied that any injuries were inflicted at any of its sites, blaming Israeli troops firing on Palestinians trying to reach the four hubs it has established in southern and central Gaza.In Gaza, the GHF has become infamous for the near-daily shootings of people seeking food who have queued to receive meals since the group started operating in early May. Palestinians seeking food have to navigate a complicated set of instructions and stick to specific routes, as well as walk long distances to access the food sites. Even then there is no guarantee they will be safe.On Friday the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières said its teams in Gaza were witnessing “a sharp and unprecedented rise in acute malnutrition”. The number of cases at its Gaza City clinic has nearly quadrupled over the past two months.At least 10 people were killed and more than 60 injured on Friday when Israeli forces opened fire on a crowd in Rafah, southern Gaza, according to Ahmad al-Farra, the head of paediatrics at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, which received the dead and wounded.At least 15 Palestinians were killed overnight and on Friday by Israeli airstrikes in northern Gaza, including a strike on a school serving as a refugee shelter.“The situation in the hospital was like it always is during massacres: extreme overcrowding, shortage of medical supplies and medicines, and a very high number of injured compared with the number of doctors,” said Farra.Treatment units were set up outside the hospital to cope with the influx of patients as hallways inside filled with the wounded.The situation in the hospital, one of the few medical facilities still operating in southern Gaza, was made more difficult after the Israeli military operated in the surrounding areas overnight.Doctors reported shells landing nearby and heavy gunfire on the outskirts of the hospital, with a number of patients arriving with gunshot wounds.The areas around the hospital were filled with encampments for displaced people and witnesses said Israeli forces had stationed tanks and fired teargas at tents. Two local people reported Israeli soldiers in a nearby cemetery, while one said they saw the soldiers exhuming bodies there.View image in fullscreenPalestinians inspect the destruction at a makeshift displacement camp and adjacent cemetery after a reported incursion by the Israeli military in Khan Younis.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesIsraeli forces withdrew from the surrounding areas in the morning, but Farra warned the hospital only had enough fuel for the next 48 hours unless new supplies arrived. Air conditioning had to be shut off in the hospital to preserve power amid the sweltering summer heat.Nahla abu Qursheen, a 35-year-old mother of four who fled the tanks on Thursday, said those who did return to the encampment found their tents destroyed. Pictures showed ruined tents amid deep furrows in the ground on Friday.“I still don’t know what happened to our tent. We are still here on the street. Last night was very difficult – missiles and shelling. My children slept on top of each other, just to fit under a single piece of cloth,” Abu Qursheen said, exhausted from sleeping in the street.Israel has intensified its airstrikes on Gaza over the last week, as negotiators report a ceasefire deal is in sight, but not yet achieved.The US president, Donald Trump, said on Wednesday he was optimistic a deal was possible this week or next, during the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington. Hamas reportedly agreed to release 10 hostages of the 50 that remain, during the two-month ceasefire period.Qatari mediators have warned a ceasefire will take time, as key stumbling blocks remain. Hamas wants assurances that Israel will not restart fighting as it did in mid-March after the first Gaza ceasefire, while Israel is seeking the complete expulsion of Hamas from the Gaza Strip.Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, has floated the proposal of relocating the population to a “humanitarian city” in southern Gaza, which legal experts have described asa blueprint for crimes against humanity.Juliette Touma, the communications director for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said such a plan would worsen the humanitarian crisis and forcibly displace people in Gaza.The war in Gaza started after Hamas-led militants killed more than 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 hostages on 7 October 2023. More than 57,000 people have been killed during Israel’s 21 months of military operations there.As negotiations drag on, people in Gaza say they are losing hope.“They say there is a truce, they say! Every day they say it will end today or tomorrow, but it’s all lies. Wake up and stop this war. Enough of the death, the hunger and the constant displacement,” Abu Qursheen said.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelUnited NationsHuman rightsAidnewsShareReuse this content"

But he did not come home completely empty-handed.The Israeli PM’s visit was his third since Donald Trump’s inauguration, with several high-profile meetings at the White House, a nomination for Trump to receive the Nobel peace prize, and suggestions from Trump and the special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, that peace could be achieved in a week.But as Netanyahu’s trip ended, no clear results had been achieved. Witkoff postponed a trip to Doha on Tuesday as it became clear that the negotiations had not reached a point where they could produce a ceasefire agreement.While Netanyahu repeated a refrain that a ceasefire could be announced within days, a deal to bring peace to more than 2 million Palestinians in theGazaStrip remained elusive.Nearly 800 killed at Gaza food hubs and aid convoy routes since end of May, UN saysRead more“I hope we can complete it in a few days,” Netanyahu said during an appearance on Newsmax, a conservative, pro-Trump news network on Wednesday. “We’ll probably have a 60-day ceasefire. Get the first batch [of hostages] out and then use the 60 days to try to negotiate an end to this.”By Thursday, when he attended a memorial service for two Israeli embassy staff killed in Washington, Netanyahu saidIsraelwould not compromise on its demands for Hamas to disband. “I am promoting a move that will result in a significant liberation, but only on the conditions Israel demands: Hamas disarm, Gaza demilitarise,” he said. “If it is not achieved through diplomacy, it will be achieved by force.”Several officials suggested during the week that only a single sticking point remained between negotiators in Doha: the extent of a withdrawal by the Israel Defense Forces that would follow the release of some of the hostages being held by Hamas. The White House had pushed back against an initial map that would have left Israel with significant zones of control in Gaza, which Witkoff had compared to a “Smotrich plan”, referring to the hardline Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich. Israel reportedly redrew that map to make it more palatable to the US administration.But Hamas has said there were other disagreements, including negotiations over whether the Gaza Humanitarian Fund, an Israeli and US-backed logistics group, would be allowed to continue to deliver food to the territory (the UN said on Friday that798 people had been killedtrying to reach GHF sites since its introduction in May) and whether Israel would agree to a permanent truce, which it has said it would not. US mediators sought to bridge the gap by telling Qatari intermediaries they would guarantee the ceasefire’s continuation after 60 days as negotiations continued.The upshot is that while Netanyahu leaves the US without a ceasefire, he has managed his relationship with Trump through high-profile assurances that he is seeking a peace in Gaza, while maintaining a status quo that members of his rightwing coalition, including the ministers Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, have said is preferable to a peace deal.For Netanyahu, the trip produced images that reinforced Israeli claims there was “no daylight” between him and Trump, and came as the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, announced a decision to imposesanctions on Francesca Albanese, a UN expert on the occupied Palestinian territories, for urging the international criminal court to investigate Israeli officials and US companies over the Gaza war.Trump’s frustrations with Netanyahu appeared to be boiling over a month ago as the US president sought to negotiate a truce between Iran and Israel, which had been trading airstrikes and missile barrages as Israel sought to dismantle the Iranian nuclear programme.“I’m not happy with Israel,” he said on the White House lawn. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing.”That recalled remarks by Robert Gates, a former US secretary of defence, about successive White House administrations’ difficulties in managing an ally in the region that also had considerable political influence in the US.“Every president I worked for, at some point in his presidency, would get so pissed off at the Israelis that he couldn’t speak,” Gates said.But a full breach with the US would have been disastrous for Netanyahu, who is managing his own difficult coalition and has been targeted in a graft investigation at home that was again delayed as a result of his international travel. And, after joint strikes against Iran, the Israeli PM was keen to show that the two men were in lockstep, while giving theTrump administrationan opportunity to show it was working toward a Gaza peace.Elliott Abrams, the senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, said the Trump administration had sought, as it did during the first short-lived ceasefire, to bring “pressure to bear on Israel directly” through discussions with Netanyahu and his chief lieutenant, Ron Dermer, and “trying to bring pressure on Hamas mostly through the Qataris, when there are these talks in Doha”.He added: “Whether that pressure is effective is unclear.”Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuTrump administrationIsraelIsrael-Gaza warGazaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

Israel and the US, which provides military support, have both strongly denied that accusation.Israel has faced accusations of genocide at the international court of justice and of war crimes at the international criminal court (ICC) over its devastating military assault on Gaza.The sanctions on Albanese set a dangerous precedent, said the spokesperson for the UN secretary general, António Guterres, adding that the special rapporteurs did not report to Guterres and he had no authority over them.Jürg Lauber, the UN human rights council president, said he regretted Washington’s decision and called on all UN member states “to fully cooperate with the special rapporteurs and mandate holders of the council and to refrain from any acts of intimidation or reprisal against them”.Netanyahu is playing Trump with his ridiculous Nobel peace prize nomination | Mohamad BazziRead moreThe UN rights chief, Volker Türk, called for a halt to “attacks and threats” against people appointed by the UN and other international institutions such as the ICC, whose judges have also been hit with US sanctions.In recent weeks, Albanese has issued a series of letters urging other countries to put pressure on Israel, including through sanctions, to end its deadly bombardment of the Gaza Strip. The Italian national has also been a strong supporter of the ICC’s indictment of Israeli officials, including the prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, for war crimes. She most recently issued a reportnaming several US companiesamong those aiding what she described as Israel’s occupation and war on Gaza.On Wednesday the US secretary of state said on social media: “Albanese’s campaign of political and economic warfare against the United States and Israel will no longer be tolerated.“We will always stand by our partners in their right to self-defence,” Marco Rubio wrote.He announced Albanese would be added to the US sanctions list for work that had prompted what he described as illegitimate prosecutions of Israelis at the ICC.Albanese has been the target of criticism from pro-Israel officials and groups in the US and in the Middle East. Last week, the US mission to the UN issued a scathing statement calling for her removal for “a years-long pattern of virulent antisemitism and unrelenting anti-Israel bias”.The statement said Albanese’s allegations of Israel committing genocide or apartheid were “false and offensive”.The US sanctions are the culmination of an extraordinary and sprawling campaign of nearly six months by the Trump administration to quell criticism of Israel’s handling of the deadly war in Gaza. Earlier this year, the Trump administrationbegan arresting and deporting faculty and students of American universitieswho participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and other political activities.Explore more on these topicsUnited NationsTrump administrationGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesInternational criminal courtMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Responding to the charges, Hasina’s Awami League party condemned the trial process and said the tribunal was a “kangaroo” court.Up to 1,400 peoplewere killedbetween July and August 2024, according to the United Nations. Prosecutors claim that Hasina held overall command responsibility for the violence.

It was among a tranche of almost identical letters sent by Trump to world leaders on Monday.“This is the first public formal recognition that I’ve seen,” said Richard Horsey, a seniorMyanmaradviser for the International Crisis Group, describing it as “a gift to the regime”.Letters might previously have been sent privately, he added, but it was highly unlikely these would have been from Trump. He said the military regime was seeking to use it as a diplomatic opportunity to get “some sort of renormalisation with the US through the back door”.In his response to Trump, Min Aung Hlaing drew a parallel between the Myanmar election of November 2020 –won in a landslideby Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy – and the US presidential election of the same month, won by Joe Biden, reiterating baseless claims of election fraud in relation to both votes.The military leader wrote: “Similar to the challenges you encountered during the 2020 election of the United States, we also experienced major electoral fraud and significant irregularities.”The junta leader thanked the president for “regulating broadcasting agencies and funds”. Trump has cut funding to Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, which have provided independent coverage of the conflict in Myanmar and relentless human rights atrocities committed by the military.Min Aung Hlaing facessanctions from the USfor his role in both the deadly crackdown against the Rohingya minority, which is now the subject of agenocide case in the international court of justice, and the 2021 coup, which plunged Myanmar into civil war.Min Aung Hlaing asked Trump to “reconsider easing and lifting the economic sanctions imposed on Myanmar”, and sought a tariff of 10%-20%, offering rates of 0%-10% on US exports to Myanmar in exchange.Whether Trump will be persuaded by Min Aung Hlaing’s response remains to be seen. Horsey noted the letter was a “pedestrian effort” compared with those of other countries – including Pakistan and Israel, which havenominated Trump for a Nobel peace prize.It is understood that the US continues to call for Myanmar’s military regime to cease its violence, release political prisoners, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and begin genuine dialogue with opposition groups. The US says its tariff policy will level the playing field for American farmers and manufacturers.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarDonald TrumpTrump tariffsSouth and central AsiaTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Unite rejected a deal in Birmingham and their demands would have undermined equal pay, discriminating against female workers. Angela won’t be pushed around, and she quit Unite some months ago.“Angela’s been fighting for equal pay for decades as a trade unionist, and as a home-care worker has experienced what it was like to be paid less as a working-class woman for the same work.”View image in fullscreenStriking bin workers stand in front of billboards commissioned by Unite this week in Birmingham.Photograph: Guy Smallman/Getty ImagesThe Unite motion said Rayner and several Labour councillors had been suspended for “bringing the union into disrepute” and there would be an investigation into their behaviour with a “view to expelling them from the union”, although this would appear not to be possible in Rayner’s case.She is understood to have made her last membership payment in April, although she was still recorded as being a member of Unite on the last list of ministerial interests published on 29 May.The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, accused the Labour-led Birmingham council of carrying out action similar to fire-and-rehire as striking workers were being replaced by agency workers and faced the possibility of redundancy.“Unite is crystal clear it will call out bad employers regardless of the colour of their rosette,” she said. “Angela Rayner has had every opportunity to intervene and resolve this dispute but has instead backed a rogue council that has peddled lies and smeared its workers fighting huge pay cuts.“The disgraceful actions of the government and a so-called Labour council is essentially fire and rehire and makes a joke of the Employment Relations Act promises. People up and down the country are asking whose side is the Labour government on and coming up with the answer: not workers.”The Unite motion, which was passed overwhelmingly, said the union was prepared to discuss its relationship with Labour if Birmingham council forced through the redundancies of striking workers.It suggests Unite could be ready to end hundreds of thousands of pounds in funding for the party. Unite gave about £2m to Labour in the year before the election. It has scaled back its financial support in recent years, with Unison now contributing more, but it is historically the party’s biggest union backer, having given more than £70m raised from its members since the Electoral Commission’s records began in 2007.Friends of Rayner in the union movement rallied round her following the spat, with many dismissing it as a performance to underline Unite’s hardline position in the bin workers’ strike.One MP close to the unions said: “Colleagues across the movement are saying Unite have completely lost the plot. Angela has done more for workers than any politician in decades and picking a fight with her shows they’re not serious.“Frankly, this behaviour won’t deliver for Unite members. It’s seems about [Graham] trying to take the limelight, posturing and her looking to next year’s general secretary election.”However, a senior Unite source said the motion was not a stunt and represented real anger at the conference among delegates about Labour’s position on the bin strike. They said Graham was representing her members and suggested a falling-out with Labour was a growing prospect.The union also voted to suspend the membership of John Cotton, the Labour leader of Birmingham council, who on Wednesday said the local authority was at the “absolute limit of what we can offer”. The council has not said what its next steps would be but it said this week that it needed to proceed with changes to its services without delay, as the latest round of talks ended without resolution.Unite’s dispute is with Birmingham city council, but since 2023 the local authority’s finances and governance have been overseen by government-appointed commissioners who are answerable to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Only Labour is delivering the change working people voted for and so deserve.”A No 10 spokesperson said of the strike that the government’s priority had always been Birmingham residents.View image in fullscreenUncollected refuse bags in the Aston area of Birmingham in June. There are still issues with uncollected rubbish in the city.Photograph: Jacob King/PAThere is still uncollected rubbish in Birmingham, although the situation has improved since late March when the councildeclared a major incidentover the mountains of bin bags on the streets.In May, the council secured a court order preventing striking bin workers on the picket line from delaying bin lorries leaving depots, which was one of their tactics to ensure the strike had the most impact.Many regular bin collections have since resumed, with the lorries being staffed by agency workers. But parts of the city, particularly more deprived areas, still have piles of waste in the street, with the smell exacerbated by the hot weather.Recycling bin collections in the city of more than 1 million people have been suspended since early February and residents have been told to take their recycling waste to the tip or store it at home. In reality, many people have put it in their general waste bin, with growing concern about the environmental impact as the strike drags on.Explore more on these topicsLabourAngela RaynerUniteBirminghamIndustrial actionEnglandTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

His return to the White House has spurred a climate backlash as hepushes for higher production of oil and gas.HSBC net zero goal delayed 20 years, as CEO offered 600% bonusRead moreHSBC was a founding member of the NZBA at its launch in 2021, with the bank’s then chief executive, Noel Quinn, saying it was vital to “establish a robust and transparent framework for monitoring progress” towards net zero carbon-emission targets.“We want to set that standard for the banking industry. Industry-wide collaboration is essential in achieving that goal,”Quinn said.Convened by the UN environment programme’s finance initiative but led by banks, the NZBA commits members to aligning their lending, investment and capital markets activities with net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 or earlier.Six of the largest banks in the US – JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs – left the NZBA after Trump was elected.UK lenders including Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest, Standard Chartered and Nationwidewere still listed as members as of Friday afternoon.In February HSBC announced it wasdelaying key parts of its climate goals by 20 yearsand watering down environmental targets in a new long-term bonus plan for its chief executive, Georges Elhedery, who took over last year.The climate campaign group ShareAction condemned the move, saying it was “yet another troubling signal around the bank’s commitment to addressing the climate crisis”.Jeanne Martin, ShareAction’s co-director of corporate engagement, said: “It sends a counterproductive message to governments and companies, despite the multiplying financial risks of global heating and the heatwaves, floods and extreme weather it will bring.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He dedicated his life to policing and will be remembered as one of the most influential police leaders of recent decades.“Lord Ian will also be remembered for the vast contribution he made to improving our overall approach to policing and the service we provide to victims.”Born in Chester in 1953, Blair joined the Met in 1974. He was an Oxford graduate, then rare in policing. He eventually moved to Thames Valley police as assistant chief constable before becoming chief constable of Surrey police and returning to the Met in 2000 to take up the position of deputy commissioner.Blair’s death came 20 years after the month of the two biggest events of his career.He faced strong calls for his resignation over the shooting of the innocent Brazilian electrician De Menezes on 22 July 2005, the day after terrorists had attempted a repeat attack on London’s transport system.Coming two weeks after the 7 July London bombings, officers mistook De Menezes for a suicide bomber.He was held down and shot repeatedly in the head by an armed officer at Stockwell tube station in south London.Blair insisted on fighting a health and safety prosecution over the disaster and the force was found guilty by a jury of “catastrophic” failings.His labelling as a liberal police officer led to rightwing papers and internal critics damning him as obsessed with political correctness. He stressed the need for neighbourhood policing, but his ideas were being undermined by a force imploding.Some who were publicly loyal to him were privately aghast at his decisions, his behaviour and his inability to listen.The end of his commissionership saw top officers falling out with each other and a senior Asian officer suing for racial discrimination, as the top of the force threatened to collapse into chaos.He resigned in 2008. In his resignation letter, Blair said: “It is the duty of the commissioner to lead the Met through good times and bad: to accept the burdens and pressures of office and, above all, to be a steward of the service he commands.”In his 2009 memoir, Policing Controversy, Blair warned of the dangers of political meddling in policing: “A police service that serves one political party or individual is an emblem of dictatorship.”Explore more on these topicsIan BlairMetropolitan policeLondonHouse of LordsPoliceEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "11.10 EDTEd Balls says Labour should raise national insurance in autumn budgetLabour should raise national insurance in the budget in the autumn,Ed Balls, the former shadow chancellor, has said.Balls made the comment in the latest episode of hisPolitical Currency podcast, which he co-hosts with the former Tory chancellor George Osborne. Although Balls now works as a broadcaster and podcaster, he is still seen as one of the leading economic thinkers in Labour politics, having worked for years as Gordon Brown’s chief adviser, served in cabinet, and then held the Treasury brief in Ed Miliband’s shadow cabinet.Discussing how the government could raise the revenue it needs, in particular to fill the £6bn financial hole caused by two recent U-turns, Balls said he thought the government should raise national insurance. He said:I would do employees’ national insurance, and I would also do a penny on corporation tax - or 2p - and at the same time do an enterprise, capital gains tax-style cut for people growing their businesses.Balls said he did not think the government would raise income tax, and he said he could not see how the government would “get out of this now” without raising one of the two other big tax levers available to the Treasury, national insurance and VAT.In its manifestoLabourpromised not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT – the main taxes imposed on workers. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, did raise employer national insurance, but she argued that this did not breach the manifesto pledge because it is paid by firms, not their workers.Raising employee national insurance would be a definite breach of the manifesto. At PMQs on Wednesday Keir Starmer said he would stick to the manifesto tax commitments.Balls argued this was the wrong approach. He said:It’s much better to be open and level with people and ask everybody to make a contribution, because we need to have strong public finances and to invest in public services, and I would say, to bring child poverty down as well. But you can’t do that while sticking with manifesto commitments which box you in too hard…[Reeves and Starmer have] got to open up about what’s happened and what they’re now going to do, and blaming their backbenchers, or trying to say that they’re sticking to the letter of a manifesto commitment they’re actually breaking, is the wrong strategy.Balls has argued that the pre-election tax pledges went too far in ruling out tax increases a Labour government might find essential. In his podcast he said the government should have warned the public earlier this year that some of those pledges would have to be broken. He said:They never prepared the ground for the degree of the squeeze on the public finances, which was coming over the years ahead … They could have opened the books [after the election] and said, there is a huge problem in our public services, which is going to require us to be honest with you about the scale of what needs to be done on taxation.They could have used the Trump presidency and the tariff shock and the big downgrades to global growth to say, ‘look, we suddenly have greater pressures on our defence spending, but the economy is going to slow this year because of the tariff shock, and therefore we need now to reconsider our fiscal position.’But having used none of those opportunities, they’re now in a position where, in July, looking forward to the budget, the framing is that they’re going to have to raise taxes to sort out a fiscal gap not caused by long term growth, or failure to make big, long term fiscal decisions by the previous government or Donald Trump – but because of their U-turns, and that is a bad place for them to be.Balls has often used his podcast to to make relatively critical comments about the the government’s economic strategy. Quite what impact this has had on relations between his wife,Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, and her Treasury colleagues remains something of a mystery.ShareUpdated at11.14 EDT"

The next of kin for both women have been notified and are being supported by specially trained officers.“Following this sad update, the investigation will now also consider whether the collision contributed to their deaths.”Ch Supt Mark Hall, of Northumbria police, said: “This is an extremely sad development and all of our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of everyone affected. We will continue to support them in any way that we can at this time. Our investigations remain at an early stage, and we would ask people to avoid speculation both online and in the community.”Police urged anyone who may have information about the crash to contact them.Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He likened the flooding to “a giant, giant wave in the Pacific Ocean that the best surfers in the world would be afraid to surf”.Trump called a reporter a “bad person” for asking a question about families of the dead who are saying that their loved onescould have been saved had emergency warningsgone out before the flooding. Trump said: “I think this has been heroism. This has been incredible, the job you’ve all done.”Texas’s Camp Mystic was ‘a place of joy’. Floods turned it into a site of great lossRead moreIn an NBC News interview on Thursday, Trump said: “Nobody ever saw a thing like this coming.” He added: “This is aonce-in-every-200-years deal.” He has also suggested he would have been ready to visit Texas within hours but did not want to burden authorities still searching for the more than 170 people who are still missing.Trump’s shift in focus underscores how tragedy can complicate political calculations, even though the president has made slashing the federal workforce and charging ally turned antagonistElon Muskwith dramatically shrinking the size of government centerpieces of his administration’s opening months.The president traveled to Texas on Air Force One with Melania Trump, the first lady; Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary; Scott Turner, the housing secretary; the small business administrator, Kelly Loeffler; and senators John Cornyn andTed Cruzof Texas, among others. Trump is expected to do an aerial tour of some of the hard-hit areas.Before arriving at the Happy State Bank Expo Hall in Kerrville, where he delivered remarks, the president and his motorcade stopped at an area near the Guadalupe River in Kerrville next to an overturned tractor-trailer and downed trees. Damage appeared to be more extensive near the riverbank. Trump, his wife and the Texas governor,Greg Abbott, took a briefing about flooding there from local officials.Trump has used past disaster response efforts to launch political attacks. While still a candidate trying to win back the presidency, Trump made his own visit toNorth Carolina after Hurricane Helenelast year and accused the Biden administration of blocking disaster aid to victims in Republican-heavy areas.During his first weekend back in the White House, Trump again visited North Carolina to survey Helene damage and toured the aftermath of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles. But he also used those trips to sharply criticize the Biden administration and California officials.During Tuesday’s cabinet meeting, Trump praised the federal flooding response. Turning toKristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, which oversees Fema, he said: “You had people there as fast as anybody’s ever seen.”Noem described traveling to Texas and seeing heartbreaking scenes, including aroundCamp Mystic, the century-old all-girls Christian summer camp where at least 27 people were killed.“The parents that were looking for their children and picking up their daughter’s stuffed animals out of the mud and finding their daughter’s shoe that might be laying in the cabin,” she said.Noem said that “just hugging and comforting people matters a lot” and “this is a time for all of us in this country to remember that we were created to serve each other”.But the secretary is also co-chairing a Fema review council charged with submitting suggestions for how to overhaul the agency in coming months.“We as a federal government don’t manage these disasters. The state does,” Noem told Trump on Tuesday.She also referenced the administration’s government-reducing efforts, saying: ”We’re cutting through the paperwork of the old Fema. Streamlining it, much like your vision of how Fema should operate.”Pressed this week on whether the White House will continue to work to shutter Fema, Karoline Leavitt would not say.“The president wants to ensure American citizens always have what they need during times of need,” the White House press secretary said. “Whether that assistance comes from states or the federal government, that is a policy discussion that will continue.”Before Trump left on Friday, Russell Vought, director of the office of management and budget, similarly dodged questions from reporters at the the White House about Fema’s future – instead noting that the agency had billions of dollars in its reserves “to continue to pay for necessary expenses” and that the president has promised Texas: “Anything it needs, it will get.”“We also want Fema to be reformed,” Vought added. “The president is going to continue to be asking tough questions of all of us agencies, no different than any other opportunity to have better government.”Explore more on these topicsTexas floods 2025Trump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsTexasGreg AbbottnewsShareReuse this content"

They arrested immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally and there were also at least 10 immigrant children on site, the statement said.‘Reality TV spectacle’: outrage as federal agents raid LA neighborhood with horses and armored carsRead moreFour US citizens were arrested for “assaulting or resisting officers”, the department said. Authorities were offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of one person suspected of firing a gun at federal agents. At least one worker was hospitalized with grave injuries.During the raid, crowds of people gathered outside Glass House Farms at the Camarillo location to demand information about their relatives and protest immigration enforcement. A chaotic scene developed outside the farm that grows tomatoes, cucumbers and cannabis as authorities clad in helmets and uniforms faced off with the demonstrators. Acrid green and white billowing smoke then forced community members to retreat.View image in fullscreenFederal agents block people protesting an Ice immigration raid at a cannabis farm near Camarillo, California, on 10 July 2025.

The company said workers were detained and it is helping provide them with legal representation.“Glass House has never knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors,” the statement said.It is legal to grow and sell cannabis in California with proper licensing. State records show the company has multiple active licenses to cultivate cannabis.On Friday, about two dozen people waited outside the Camarillo farm to retrieve the cars of loved ones and speak to managers about what happened. Relatives of Jaime Alanis, who has worked picking tomatoes at the farm for 10 years, said he called his wife in Mexico during the raid to tell her immigration agents had arrived and that he was hiding with others inside the farm.“The next thing we heard was that he was in the hospital,” Juan Duran, Alanis’ brother-in-law, said in Spanish, his voice breaking.Elizabeth Strater, national vice president of the United Farm Workers, said Alanis was injured after a 30-foot fall from a building during the raid.View image in fullscreenJuan Duran, and his wife, no name given, wait outside Glass House Farms, where a relative was injured during a previous day immigration raid, on 11 July 2025, in Camarillo, California.

Relatives and advocates headed to the farm about 50 miles (80km) north-west of downtown Los Angeles to try to find out what was going on, and began protesting outside.Federal authorities formed a line blocking the road leading through farm fields to the company’s greenhouses. Protesters were seen shouting at agents wearing camouflage gear, helmets and gas masks. The billowing smoke drove protesters to retreat. It wasn’t clear why authorities threw the canisters or if they released chemicals such as teargas.Ventura county fire authorities responding to a 911 call of people having trouble breathing said three people were taken to nearby hospitals.At the farm, agents arrested workers and removed them by bus. Others, including US citizens, were detained at the site for hours while agents investigated.The incident came as federal immigration agents have ramped up arrests in southern California at car washes, farms and Home Depot parking lots, stoking widespread fear among immigrant communities.The mother of an American worker said her son was held at the worksite for 11 hours and told her agents took workers’ cellphones to prevent them from calling family or filming and forced them to erase cell phone video of agents at the site.View image in fullscreenPeople embrace outside Glass House Farms, a day after an immigration raid on the facility, on 11 July in Camarillo, California.

She spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because she feared reprisals from the government.United Farm Workers said in statement that some US citizens are not yet accounted for.Maria Servin, 68, said her son has worked at the farm for 18 years and was helping to build a greenhouse. She said she spoke to her son, who is undocumented, after hearing of the raid and offered to pick him up.“He said not to come because they were surrounded and there was even a helicopter. That was the last time I spoke to him,” Servin, a US citizen, said in Spanish.She said she went to the farm anyway but federal agents were shooting teargas and rubber bullets and she decided it was not safe to stay. She and her daughter returned to the farm Friday and were told her son had been arrested Thursday. They still don’t know where he is being held.“I regret 1,000 times that I didn’t help him get his documents,” Servin said.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastUS immigrationTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

They became known locally as the “Chapitos”, or “little Chapos”, and federal authorities in 2023 described the operation as a major effort to send “staggering” quantities of fentanyl into the US.As part of a plea agreement, Ovidio Guzmán López admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the United States, fueling a crisis that has contributed to tens of thousands of overdose deaths annually.Ovidio Guzmán López pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges tied to his leadership role in the cartel. Terms of the deal, including sentencing recommendations or cooperation agreements, were not immediately disclosed.Speculation about a deal had percolated for months, as behind-the-scenes negotiations quietly progressed.Jeffrey Lichtman, an attorney for the two brothers, said on Friday he would wait until Ovidio Guzmán López was sentenced before discussing whether the agreement was a good deal.Ovidio Guzmán López’s sentencing was postponed while he cooperates with US authorities, as he agreed to do on Friday. Whether he avoids a life in prison sentence depends on whether authorities say he has held up his end of the agreement.Lichtman said he did not know whether the case against Joaquín Guzmán López could be resolved with a plea deal, noting that it was “completely different”.“Remember, Joaquín was arrested in America well after Ovidio was, so it takes time,” he said.Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School and former assistant US attorney in Los Angeles, said that Ovidio Guzmán López, by pleading guilty, may have “saved other family members”.“In this way, he has some control over who he’s cooperating against and what the world will know about that cooperation.”Levenson called the plea change a “big step” for the US. government and said Ovidio Guzmán López could provide “a roadmap of how to identify members of the cartel”.“This is big,” she said. “The best way for them to take out the cartel is to find out about its operations from an insider, and that’s what they get from his cooperation.”The Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, on Friday criticized the “lack of coherence” in American policy toward Mexican cartels, highlighting the disparity between the US government declaring cartels foreign terrorist organizations, but also striking plea deals with their leaders.Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years. The brothers allegedly assumed their father’s former leadership role in the cartel.Ovidio Guzmán López was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the United States. He initially pleaded not guilty but had signaled in recent months his intent to change his plea.Joaquín Guzmán López and another longtime Sinaloa leader, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, were arrested in July 2024 in Texas after they landed in the US on a private plane. Both men have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges. Their dramatic capture prompted a surge in violence in Mexico’s northern state of Sinaloa as two factions of the Sinaloa cartel clashed.Explore more on these topicsJoaquín 'El Chapo' GuzmánDrugs tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The 90-day “pause” on the highest tariffs threatened by Trump on his so-called“liberation day”in April elapsed on Wednesday. But with just three trade agreements in place, instead of the 300 once promised, the White House had switched one deadline for another.Optimists, who seem to include many on Wall Street, interpreted this latest slippage as evidence that Trump will never go through with the most damaging tariffs.But as he published a slew of tariff letters to individual countries throughout the week, less hopeful observers sensed a reinvigorated Trump, who seemed to be channelling the spirit of “liberation day”, when he held up that gameshow-style card, promising punitive levies on countries that had “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” the US.These letters – all released on Truth Social and featuring Trump’s thick signature in Sharpie pen – included swingeing tariff rates of50% on Brazil, 30% on Sri Lanka and35% on Canada. As in April, some pointed to issues well beyond the sphere of trade – thefate of Brazil’s ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, for example, and alleged fentanyl trafficking from Canada.“If we compare where we are now with where we were in April, many of the tariffs that he is describing and the letters that he’s sent out are very similar to what he described then,” said Prof Maurice Obstfeld, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for InternationalEconomics. “I think what this shows is that the bluster in April about, ‘we’re going to negotiate all these trade deals’, was way overhyped.”The stock markets have broadlyshrugged off Trump’s latest flurry of threats, apparently assuming this latest deadline will slide by, like the end of the 90-day pause. After plunging after “liberation day”, the S&P 500 index of leading shares posted a record high – though the renewed hostilities with Canada did prompt a wobble on Friday.Obstfeld notes that bond markets appear less upbeat, betting that the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates four times in the next 12 months. “Bond markets are pricing in all these interest rate cuts, which are predicated on a slowdown in the economy and a slowdown in inflation. If that’s what you believe, that the economy’s going to slow down, it’s hard to see why the stock market is behaving as it is,” he says. “Something’s got to give at some point.”The dollar has also confounded economists’ expectations,suffering its worst first half in 50 years, despite the textbook response to tariffs being a stronger currency.Aside from the hit to the currency, there is scant evidence of a significant impact on the US economy, however, with jobs data coming in well above expectations last week, for example.But experts believe that may not last. “We’ve seen a lot of resilience in the data to date, but I think a lot of that is down to front loading – people trying to get in ahead of the tariffs, and boosting activity as a result,” says Ben May, the director of global macro research at Oxford Economics. “We’re now at the point where that’s going to be fading. The fact that we haven’t seen that weakness yet doesn’t mean it’s not going to come.”Neil Shearing, the chief global economist at consultancy Capital Economics, suggests the full impact of the tariffs has been muted by the agreement the US recently made with China – and would be further contained, if a handful of other hoped-for deals with major economies materialise.“We don’t know where the tariffs will land, but importantly from the perspective of the US, now a deal has been done with the UK, China, Vietnam, if one is done with India and the EU, and then Mexico and Canada, that covers just over 75% of US trade.” He describes the impact on the US in that case as a “mild stagflationary shock” – pushing inflation above the Federal Reserve’s 3% target and putting the brakes on growth.The Federal Reserve’s chair, Jerome Powell, who has repeatedly been attacked by Trump for failing to bring rates down faster,recently made clear that tariffs were to blame. “Essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs. We didn’t overreact, in fact we didn’t react at all. We’re simply taking some time,” he said.Even if the average tariff rate for most countries ends up being something between 10 and 20% – much lower than the “liberation day” rates – it marks a historic shift for the global trading system.“From a US perspective this is still a generational increase in tariffs,” says Shearing. “It would take the effective tariff rate to somewhere between 15 and 20%, having been at 2.5%. It takes you back to tariff rates last seen in the 1940s.”Forecasters, including the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England, have also repeatedly highlighted the cost to the economy of the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariffs, which leave firms without the information they need to make investment decisions.While Trump’s latest barrage of letters and pronouncements did not answer the question of where tariffs will ultimately land, it did make one thing clear: that uncertainty is very likely to continue for a long time to come.Meanwhile, there appears little evidence that the policy is achieving the president’s stated aim of bringing manufacturing jobs flooding back to the US. “It’s unlikely we’re going to see a manufacturing renaissance any time soon because of tariffs,” says Obstfeld. “It’s very hard to see how that goal is achieved.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsEconomicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Some measurements were taken more than a hundred miles away from sites.The findings are likely to heighten concerns around whether the air around many large factories is, or will be, safe to breathe. Public health advocates and environmental attorneys have long claimed readings are manipulated in a bid to push through planned sites – and warned that practices uncovered in Michigan were not unique. The safety of air around many of the nation’s factories is similarly unclear.Among the facilities is a Stellantis auto plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan, a large Detroit suburb. In 2016, Michigan environmental regulators approved a permit application allowing then-FCA Chrysler to increase particulate matter emissions.The projected level of new particulate matter combined with current levels around the plant would not violate federal limits, FCA claimed: the air would remain safe.But the air monitor FCA used to arrive at that conclusion was 17 miles to the north in New Haven, a largely rural community with cleaner air than Sterling Heights. FCA and regulators ignored two closer monitors in urban areas with dirtier airsheds that more closely matched that of Sterling Heights. Per Clean Air Act best practices, FCA should have installed an air monitor at its plant to determine the levels.It did not. No one knows how much dangerous particulate matter hangs in the region around the Sterling Heights plant. Stellantis did not respond to a request for comment.“It’s an abuse to say ‘Oh yeah, that’s good enough,’ because you didn’t look,” said Seth Johnson, an attorney with the Earthjustice non-profit who has litigated on permitting issues. “If you don’t care about what people in an area are breathing then you don’t want to look.”In some cases, air quality data is used from monitors hundreds of miles away. In other instances, no data is collected when the law requires it to be. Sometimes companies ignore nearby monitors and use data from a monitor further away, where the air is cleaner, as FCA did.The types of facilities that apply for permits include major polluters like power plants, auto factories and other heavy industry sites. When the Swedish paper giant Billerud wanted to expand its Escanaba, Michigan, mill in 2023, it used readings for nitrogen dioxide from a monitor about 150 miles south-east, in Houghton Lake, Michigan. Its particulate matter readings came from monitors about 130 miles west in Potawatomi, Wisconsin.The Lansing Board of Water and Light, meanwhile, relied on carbon monoxide data from a monitor in Grand Rapids, about 68 miles away, when it wanted to expand a power plant.Neither monitored onsite for the pollutants. Billerud and Lansing Board of Water did not respond to requests for comment.The Michigan department of environment, Great Lakes and energy (EGLE) said the agency “does not deliberately choose a monitor” that makes it appear as if pollution levels are lower than they are. Using the Billerud example, a spokesperson said the airsheds in Houghton and Potawatomi were similar enough to Escanaba to draw conclusions about the safety of the air in Escanaba.“In this case and many others like it, using monitors farther away is a better and more conservative way to evaluate an applicant’s request,” an EGLE spokesperson, Josef Greenberg, said in a statement.However, Potawatomi is in a state forest, and Houghton is similarly more rural in character than Escanaba. That prompts questions about the accuracy of EGLE’s claim, said Nick Leonard, a lawyer with the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center, which has sued Michigan regulators over some permit approvals. Such scenarios should trigger onsite monitoring, he said.“You’d think it’s a technocratic process, but it’s not,” Leonard said. “Companies seeking a permit more or less tell EGLE what data they want to use,and EGLE rubber-stamps it every time. They never do a meaningful assessment of the data, and they never require permit applicants to do onsite monitoring even though that is an option under the Clean Air Act and encouraged by EPA [the Environmental Protection Agency].”‘Real impacts on real people’The Guardian obtained major Michigan air pollution permit applications for 2014 to 2024 via Freedom of Information Act (Foia) requests. The permit applications were submitted during the administrations of the former Republican governor Rick Snyder and the current Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer.The Clean Air Act states companies must obtain a permit to emit air pollutants covered by National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), such as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide.The EPA sets limits for the pollutants, which are linked to lung disease, cancer and a range of other health problems. The Clean Air Act also states that permit applicants must demonstrate that “emissions from construction or operation of such a facility will not cause, or contribute to, air pollution in excess of any” NAAQS limit.Best practices state that applicants should demonstrate their projects will not violate limits by adding local air monitors’ ambient pollution levels to their projected emissions. State environmental regulators most often handle the permit requests.EPA rules and best practices around air monitors call for state agencies to require companies to use data from a monitor within about six miles. If a monitor is not available, a “regional” monitor further away can be used, but conditions in the two locations’ airsheds should be similar.That option should be used sparingly, the best practices state. If no comparable air monitors are available, then a company should install a monitor onsite and check the air for a year.That virtually never happens in Michigan or elsewhere, said Michael Koerber, a retired deputy director of the EPA’s Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, which worked with EGLE and other states on air permitting. “Do projects generally do that? I can’t think of too many that really did,” he added.EGLE saidin a statement it rarely required onsite monitoring, but noted that it regularly consulted with the EPA on the decisions, and the EPA also has not felt that onsite monitoring was required.If a company’s projected emissions violate the NAAQS limits, they could be required to take any number of steps, like putting in better pollution controls, or reducing pollution at a different facility. But that rarely happens, public health advocates say.“It’s easy to get lost in the arcane details of all of this,but at the end of the day we’re talking about pollution that is really bad for people. And it has real impacts on real people,” Johnson said.‘Business as usual’The air in south-west Detroit near Zug Island is among the dirtiest in the nation, filled with pollutants from steelmakers, automakers and others who operate factories in the dense industrial zone.By 2023, the level of toxic particulate matter there was on the brink of violating federal air quality limits, and the concrete producer Edward C Levy Co applied to add more from aproposedslag grinding facility.The problem: the particulate matter thatLevy’s facility would emit would cause the region to be in violation of federal limits for the pollutant, data from the application and a state air quality monitor positioned about 0.65 miles from the site showed.Still, the state approved the permit in late 2023. It and Levy ignored data from the nearby monitor, instead using readings from a monitor six miles away in Allen Park, where the air is cleaner. That made it appear as if Levy would not cause a violation.EGLE’s decision was “business as usual”,said Theresa Landrum, who lives in south-west Detroit. The firm’s founder,Edward Levy, is politically connected and a prolific campaign donor, and EGLE, “doesn’t seem that EGLE is working on behalf of the people”, Landrum said. Levy did not respond to a request for comment.EGLE at the time defended its decision, claiming it used modeling to show there would not be a violation. Leonard’s law firm has sued, and the case is currently in a state appeals court after a lower court judge ruled there was no violation.Leonard said he had never seen the EPA or EGLE show data to support its decisions, and their approach varies from permit to permit.“Sometimes they use the closest monitor, sometimes not,” he said. “Sometimes they use a monitor from an area that typically has high levels of air pollution, sometimes not. Sometimes they use a monitor upwind of the facility, sometimes they use one that is downwind.“The lack of criteria and variability from permit to permit makes this fertile ground for manipulation.”Leonard pointed to a 2018 application to increase sulfur dioxide emissions at the Arbor Hills landfill in Northville Township, a suburb at the western edge of Detroit’s metro area. It pulled air quality data from Allen Park, about 22 miles away. EGLE approved the permit.Leonard said EGLE in part justified the use of the Allen Park monitor because it classified the new project as a “single source” of pollution, or in effect the only major source of air emissions in the area. But EPA records show 164 other companies in a 10-mile radius have such high emission levels that they must report to the EPA.Currently, no one knows if the pollution from Arbor Hills’ expansion combined with the pollution from the other major sources has made Northville Township’s air unsafe.Leonard said he had pushed EGLE to do more onsite monitoring. “They look at me like I’m crazy if I even suggest it,” he claimed.Arbor Hills Energy LLC, the landfill’s former owner, and Opal Fuels its current owner, did not respond to requests for comment.The EPAThe blame lies with the EPA and state regulators, advocates say. The EPA “doesn’t like” the pre-construction monitoring and data requirements, and “has fought against it for 40 years”, Johnson of Earthjustice, said.The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.The agency in the late 1970s issued a rule under the Clean Air Act that did not require companies to provide air quality monitoring data to show their project would not violate federal limits. Earthjustice and Sierra Clubsued, arguing the law explicitly called for data, and in 2013 a federal court agreed.But the EPA did not begin requiring meaningful data, Johnson added. Instead, it started “doing this run around” in which it allowed existing data to be pulled from monitors up to hundreds of miles away that often does not provide a clear picture of air pollution around the proposed facilities.The law, however, isless clearabout how companies must demonstrate compliance with the limits. State agencies, with EPA approval, are essentially exploiting those gray areas or non-enforceable best practices, Johnson said.Michigan could do more, too, Leonard said. Whitmer has promoted herself as an environmental justice (EJ) leader, taking steps such as creating state panels that advise on such issues. But when it comes to decisions that will truly protect communities, like permitting, she typically puts the industry’s needs first, according to Leonard.That hasn’t gone unnoticed in south-west Detroit, Landrum said: “Whitmer hasn’t stepped out on EJ issues. She puts corporate profits over people.”Whitmer’s office did not respond to a request for comment.‘A matter of priorities’In Monroe, Michigan, the Gerdau Steel plant is spitting high levels of nitrogen dioxide into the air. In an apparent direct violation of the Clean Air Act, no data was provided to determine if it violated the NAAQS.Gerdau Steel did not respond to a request for comment.Public health advocates say it doesn’t need to be this way. Part of the problem is the low number of air quality monitors. Michigan has in place just 30 PM2.5 monitors to cover its approximately 97,000 sq miles, making it rare for a monitor to be within six miles of a proposed project.Though the 2021 Inflation Reduction Act provided funding for air quality monitors, Michigan didn’t expand its network. Johnson said advances in satellite and mobile air monitoring could make it easier to gather data around a facility.EGLE in its statement said onsite monitoring was costly and time intensive. But former EPA official Koerber noted the projects often take years to plan, so monitoring onsite for a year is a relatively inexpensive and easy step for companies to take. He also said firms could do post-construction monitoring, so the public knows for sure whether there is a problem.The fixes aren’t that difficult, according toJohnson. It’s “just a matter of priorities”, he said.“People have the right to know what they’re breathing and what they’re going to breathe in the future. To deprive people of that right is anti-democratic.”This project was funded by the Fund for Investigative JournalismExplore more on these topicsAir pollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

But behind those Phuket photos lies a meticulous spreadsheet.​​Rather than aggressively stockpiling for retirement, gen Z is embracing a “soft saving” approach, according to research: prioritizing memorable experiences now while saving extra cash for the future.Asignificantnumber of gen Zers are frequent travelers, averaging three leisure trips a year, according to Morning Consult, despite 60% earning less than $50,000 annually.How are they fitting travel into their budget? The answer appears to be an unusually focused attitude to how they spend money.“I don’t want to miss out on opportunities when I am young, but I also don’t want to go into debt,” said Sofia Qistina, 22, who stressed that she prefers to spend more on experience than material items. “Being financially aware is the best thing possible, because then you’re able to see where you can stretch your budget and where you can’t.”View image in fullscreenSofia Qistina in Bali.Photograph: Qistina PhotosMore than other generations, a majority of gen Z splurges intentionally, according to a recent McKinseyreport. Many young consumers open dedicated travel or experience funds alongside their retirement savings, anduseon loyalty programs such as credit card points to lower trip expenses.“When I was 20 and younger, I would spend exorbitantly on many luxury things just ’cause I thought they were cool and I was always on a high. But I lost a lot of opportunities and comfort,” said Qistina, who is now studying abroad and working as a freelance social media marketer in Sydney, Australia. “I realized that way of living was toxic and not sustainable. So now, everything is overly calculated and I am very intentional with how I spend my money.”Andy Reed, a financial behavior expert at Vanguard, said when people spend on experiences, they typically derive more pleasure than when they spend on things. “But it’s also true that gen Zers are also saving more than their predecessors,” he added, noting that “baggage” including a higher cost of living, the Covid-19 recession and student debt has helped shape their financial habits and anxieties.View image in fullscreenSofia Qistina in St Moritz, Switzerland, this past January.Photograph: Qistina PhotosQistina, for example, attends parties, eats her way through Sydney, and travels with friends to cities such as Dubai and Paris. She splits her income between a high-yield savings account and a “wants” fund for traveling and social engagements.Booking her travel is no mean feat: before buying tickets, she said she compares thousands of flights, airlines, locations and dates to ensure she is getting the best value for money.A new generation of tourists is now prioritizing the value of a trip ahead of its financial cost, according to Heather Leisman, president of EF Ultimate Break, a travel agency for 18-to-35-year-olds. “Gen Z looks at value,” she said. “For them it’s not a price tag.“Affordability is a concern of theirs, but it’s also how they budget. We are seeing people booking shorter trips than before and they’re deal-seeking, meaning they are traveling in off-peak seasons or to more affordable places like Thailand or Portugal.”Qistina said: “We don’t realize that the day-to-day things that we do – like always eating out or that coffee from an overpriced cafe – adds up, and that’s why we think we’re not able to do all those big things like traveling.”Kevin Droniak, 28, does not eat at Michelin-starred restaurants or grab a $7 matcha. He lives in a cramped New York apartment, fitted with just the essentials. He saves both for retirement, and has been doing do since he was 20, but also a day trip to Egypt.“It’s very fulfilling to land somewhere and experience it, get a taste of it, and then go back home immediately,” he said after a one-night visit to Colombia. “It’s ticking off bucket list items, and it’s a memory I’ll have forever.”Some of Droniak’s day-trip locations include Iceland, Italy, France and the UK. The trips can range from about $200 to nearly $1,000. He began this “addiction” to balance his responsibilities, such as helping his 95-year-old grandmother, while seeing the world.“Everyone works so hard and you don’t get that much time off, which can prevent you from being able to travel. But you really don’t need a week off to experience something new,” he said.Droniak budgets these trips to be less than $1,000, meaning flights should be about $500 and the location should have cheap transport options,like subways or inexpensive taxis. He eats at a “basic local restaurant” to keep the food bill in check.View image in fullscreenKevin Droniak.Photograph: Lauren Nieves“I fly back-of-the-plane economy and when I am there I always look for free activities,like going to the beach or hiking,” Droniak said. “It’s good to be financially aware and at the same time I also want to live life while I am young, which means spending money for these trips.”He deems travel to be a need, rather than a want. “Traveling is my therapy, and I see it as an investment on my mental health,” he said. “These trips get me out of routines that can put me down in the dumps and being in somewhere new gives my brain a ​​serotonin boost.”But many gen Zers are balancing this serotonin boost with a secure future, too. They are making “some very good financial choices”, said Reed.Droniak saves at least $20,000 a year for retirement, and Qistina makes sure to put away a significant sum every quarter. Both opened retirement accounts due to financial anxieties and pressure from older family members, who advise them to prepare for the future.“Gen Zers, in particular, plan to spend rather than spontaneous spending,” Reed said. “As long as you cover the bases like rent and food, you can splurge,which can lead to a lot of experiences with emotional value.”Qistina sees financial success as financial freedom: the luxury of not living paycheck to paycheck, and having the means to fulfill her whims on a dime. “If I’m able to say, I’m going to Paris in three days because I kind of want a croissant, not comparing flights, and just having that flexibility – that is financial success,” she said. “I truly believe I will get there, too, because I’m pacing myself.”Explore more on these topicsTravelSavingsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Industry-wide collaboration is essential in achieving that goal,”Quinn said.Convened by the UN environment programme’s finance initiative but led by banks, the NZBA commits members to aligning their lending, investment and capital markets activities with net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 or earlier.Six of the largest banks in the US – JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs – left the NZBA after Trump was elected.UK lenders including Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest, Standard Chartered and Nationwidewere still listed as members as of Friday afternoon.In February HSBC announced it wasdelaying key parts of its climate goals by 20 yearsand watering down environmental targets in a new long-term bonus plan for its chief executive, Georges Elhedery, who took over last year.The climate campaign group ShareAction condemned the move, saying it was “yet another troubling signal around the bank’s commitment to addressing the climate crisis”.Jeanne Martin, ShareAction’s co-director of corporate engagement, said: “It sends a counterproductive message to governments and companies, despite the multiplying financial risks of global heating and the heatwaves, floods and extreme weather it will bring.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nobody in tennis can spot a Moment likeNovak Djokovic. The Moment is where he lives, breathes, puts gluten-free food on his family’s table. What happened before was irrelevant. You can rattle and bully him. You can pummel him off Centre Court for an hour, as Jannik Sinner has done. Djokovic will still prowl the chain-link fence all evening, probing it, waiting for the one gap wide enough to let him squeeze through. The point of greatest weakness is where he finds his greatest strength.Sinner’s at 30-30 on his own serve. A defensive backhand from Djokovic sits up invitingly in mid-court, pleading to be dispatched. The world No 1, utterly impeccable to this point, swings a giant fist at the ball and somehow sends it flying in the vague direction of Tooting Broadway. The crowd yelps in shock. Next point Sinner nets a weak forehand, Djokovic raises a fist of defiance, and in the space of a few minutes – plus a few extra for the now-traditional Djokovic treatment break – this particular Italian job has had its bloody doors blown off.Sinner dismantles ailing Djokovic to set up Wimbledon final against AlcarazRead moreAnd because of what Djokovic was, these moments still feel like they might mean something. Nobody ever got rich writing off the most decorated men’s player in history. But because of what Djokovic now is, these moments are so often also illusory: flickering candles of defiance in a gathering storm. Briefly rattled, Sinner collected himself, remembered he was by far the superior player, regained the break and resumedhis regal march to a first Wimbledon final.You may be tempted to posit that a grand slam semi-final is a very commendable effort, indeed a borderline-superhuman feat at 38, an age where most former champions are making their first acquaintance with Mansour Bahrami in the invitational doubles on court three. But of course this is why you are not Novak Djokovic and Novak Djokovic is: not just a perfectionist but a completist, a man who always dealt not in moments but in monuments.And on what has become his most comfortable surface, this may have been the momentProject 25 was buried for good. This was meant to go long and deep. Djokovic was going to make it painful, make it heavy, hang in there, use his experience and slowly turn the screw against an injury-hampered Sinner. Instead he was carved up in less than two hours, dominated – shockingly so – on every metric, and in one other important aspect too. Even in defeat, Djokovic could drag you into the pain zone, force you on to his turf, make you play to his rhythm.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic had a glimmer of hope in the third set before Jannik Sinner showed his power and finished off the match.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBut now the angles don’t seem to exist any more. The court feels bigger under his feet. Sinner was imperious on his serve, hitting Djokovic out of the rallies, forcing the greatest baseline player of all time away from his place of safety. And Djokovic without the baseline is basically like Hendrix without a guitar, or telling Wes Anderson he can’t use a whip pan. By the end, the ultimate back-court hustler wasn’t even bothering to chase every ball down, not even the very last, put away by Sinner as Djokovic trudged sadly back to his seat.And for all the court craft and tactical nous, the matchplay skills and the iron will, ultimately Djokovic’s main point of difference was his body: those ridiculous splaying limbs, the awesome power coiled up in that slender frame, the engine that never seemed to tire, those lightning bursts of speed when it felt like the court might catch fire under him. Djokovic at his most powerful was like playing a giant animatronic spider, a physical advantage so severe it felt like a kind of category difference.Back in his imperial phase he would regard his defeats as learning experiences, rocket fuel for his inevitable next triumph. But now there is no inevitability. Nobody knows how much “next” remains. He has 10 members of staff devoted to curating his life in tennis, everything from tactics to training to nutrition to recovery. “Sometimes I get tired of all the chores I have to do on a daily basis,” he said this week. Instead it is Sinner on the steep learning curve, a player who claims to have taken more from Djokovic’s game than anybody on tour: the consistency, the relentlessness, the bravery. He even seems to have pilfered the famous Djokovic slide, evidence of a machine intelligence set on decrypting the game’s every remaining puzzle.Jelena Djokovic always used to joke that if her husband ever had a spare 10 minutes, he would invariably spend it stretching: calves, hamstrings, shoulders, side body. Now, it’s time he’s trying to stretch out. One more gym session, one more grand slam, one more season, one more step up the mountain of immortality. ThisWimbledonfelt like his best chance of burgling one last big pot. Instead, his defeat has simply underlined the broadening chasm between the Big Two and the man they once tried to chase down.What happens now is anyone’s guess. The perfectionist in Djokovic will surely not allow him to drift through men’s tennis as a vapour of his former self, grimacing his way through painful second-round defeats as his former coach Andy Murray forced himself to do. But thecompletist in him will surely not be content to end itlike this: ground into the dirt in three short sets by a monster he helped to create. There may be more moments. There may just be one more big run. But even for Djokovic, time will not stretch for ever.Explore more on these topicsNovak DjokovicWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisanalysisShareReuse this content"

She also won 14 Grand Slam doubles titles alongside her younger sister, Serena, whose last tournament was the 2022 US Open, and a total of four Olympic gold medals.The older Williams said in 2011 that she had been diagnosed with Sjögren’s syndrome, an energy-sapping auto-immune disease that can cause joint pain.Explore more on these topicsVenus WilliamsTennisUS sportsShareReuse this content"

They were locked together at the top of the Mûr-de-Bretagne, in the Côtes-d’Armor, with the ­defending champion winning stage seven of the 2025 Tour just ahead of the Dane and regaining the yellow jersey.Pogacar is usually the ­quickest of the pair in uphill sprints, but ­Vingegaard has always been on his shoulder, with the world champion, Remco Evenepoel, still close behind.Tour de France: Pogacar beats Vingegaard to stage win and reclaims yellow jersey – as it happenedRead morePogacar leads after Mathieu van der Poel faded on the steep climb to the finish, with Evenepoel 54 seconds behind, and the French breakthrough rider, Kevin Vauquelin, holding on to third place in the general classification.The 24-year-old from Normandy has quickly captured the host nation’s affections. In the past that has often been a poisoned chalice, but ­Vauquelin has taken it in his stride. Vingegaard is fourth overall, more than a minute behind.Even Pogacar has welcomed younger rivals, such as Vauquelin and Britain’s Oscar Onley, who was third on Mûr-de-Bretagne and lies seventh and showing consistent form in his second Tour. “There’s a lot of professionalism already at a young age,” he said. “To see young guys coming through is good, ­especially Kevin in the last two days.“He has great support and Oscar Onley showed already how bright he is, with a punchy kick. He’s riding super well.”Pogacar did not have a flawless afternoon, with his key climbing support, João Almeida, crashing at speed less than 6km from the finish as the peloton descended towards the second and final climb of the Mûr.“It’s beautiful to be in yellow and win the stage,” Pogacar said, who dedicated his win to his Portuguese teammate. “It was a luxury to have João so close on GC. I hope it’s nothing broken and he can continue.”View image in fullscreenThe success of Frenchman Kevin Vauquelin has captured the host nation’s affections at the start of this year’s Tour de France.Photograph: Dario Belingheri/Getty ImagesHe has others he can lean on, such as the tall, powerful Nils Politt, who Pogacar calls “Giraffe”, but he will need Almeida when the race reaches the first long climbs next Monday on the stage to Puy de Sancy.On another hot afternoon it took 70km for a break to establish itself after a volatile opening to the stage. Geraint Thomas was joined in the mid-stage break by EF Education-EasyPost’s Alex Baudin, teammate toThursday’s winner, Ben Healy, as the American team sought another stage victory.Thomas’s escape ended 17km from the finish when he was caught on the first ascent of the Mûr. But after a ­disappointing start from Ineos ­Grenadiers, the Welshman had at least got “stuck in”, to use his own phrase.On the fast approach to the finishing circuit, centred on the dead straight two kilometre ramp of the Mûr, Pogacar’s UAE Emirates and Vingegaard’s Visma Lease-a-bike yet again jostled for supremacy. As the mercury rises, so is the tension between the two squads.“The last two days, it was some strange racing from Visma,” Pogacar said. “Let’s see their approach in the next days. The weekend will be easier and then stage 10 will be a proper hard day of suffering with hot temperatures and lots of climbs all day.”Stage eight is definitely one for the sprinters, with only a gentle fourth category climb on the 171km route from Saint-Meen-Le-Grand to Laval.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarTour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

Indeed in certain cameos it was almost possible to detect glimpses of the way in which this particular Spanish empire might eventually fall.Italy are not quite good enough to bring them down; not now, not yet. But Andrea Soncin has constructed a smart counterattacking unit that revelled in not merely going toe-to-toe with Spain but demonstrating why their cloak of invincibility contains a few loose threads. Opponents blessed with even greater speed and a more aggressive press should be suitably encouraged.A draw would have been a far from unjust result but, Portugal’s defeat against Belgium, confirmed that Italy are also quarter-finalists. While Spain, as group winners, face Switzerland in the last eight back here in Berne next Friday, Soncin’s team will meet Norway in Geneva on Wednesday.Italy swiftly settled into five at the back mode but, rapid in transition, looked to counterattack at every opportunity and it would have been no surprise had the crossbar developed a significant fissure after Elena Linari thumped the most powerful of early headers against it.Spain failed to heed that warning and paid the price when they failed to clear a low cross. Arsenal’s Mariona Caldentey for once displayed a heavy touch and Italy’s gloriously intrepid right wing-back Elisabetta Oliviero used her left foot to expertly redirect the loose ball into the back of the net.Elisabetta OlivieroIt prompted some prolonged, and extravagant, celebrations but when the dust finally settled, Spain suddenly started playing in the manner of a quietly furious team.TheWorld Cup holdersevidently regarded that goal as an insult to their pride and Real Madrid’s Athenea del Castillo responded by equalising with a first-time shot into the top corner. It followed a sumptuous dribble and one-two with Barcelona’s Alèxia Putellas whose adroit back heel confounded Soncin’s rearguard.Quite apart from repairing wounded egos it took Spain’s goal tally to 12 in three games since arriving in Switzerland while also emphasising that Del Castillo looked the brightest of the half dozen fresh faces Tomé had rotated into her starting XI.Tomé’s side had already qualified for the quarter-finals but their evident irritation whenever Italy slowed the game down – not least as Soncin’s goalkeeper, Laura Giuliani, collapsed with an apparently unfathomable injury that enabled the manager to issue a series of urgent tactical instructions – was real.View image in fullscreenEsther González scores a late third goal for Spain.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APPerhaps such rising tempers proved counter-productive to concentration because Irene Paredes subsequently, and self destructively, handled Sofia Cantore’s cross after making an awful hash of an attempted header.Italy fans were convinced it was a stonewall penalty but a VAR review detected that Cantore had been offside in the preamble and the Barcelona centre-half, Spain’s captain, was duly able to forget one of her rather less distinguished moments.Uefa’s half-time statistics indicated that Spain had completed more than 400 passes, while Italy had managed less than 200. Not that Tomé would be fooled; her team were in a tough match, against extremely awkward opponents with a highly effective style of their own.It had been a hot and sunny day in Berne but, as the second half began, those fans who had made their way to the Wankdorf Stadium in shorts and T-shirts started pulling on emergency jackets and jumpers.Soncin though suddenly started feeling the heat. He needed nothing more than his fitted white shirt and tie as Del Castillo ran, slalom style, through his defensive chicane and Martina Lenzini’s weak clearance headed to Patricia Guijarro.She could hardly pass up such a generous invitation to shoot Spain into the lead and duly did.No matter that it was not exactly the cleanest of hits, Guijarro’s strike still flew in via the inside of a post and Italy seemed to sense an almost palpable shift in the power balance. For the first time on the night La Roja really looked on top.Nonetheless Adriana Nanclares, once again preferred to Cata Coll in goal by Tomé, performed wonders to prevent Cantore’s awkwardly deflected, high velocity, shot restoring parity.Granted Giuliani did well to deny Aitana Bonmatí a chance to celebrate her recovery from meningitis by diverting the latter’s elegantly curving left-foot shot.And, admittedly, Esther González’s close-range stoppage time goal after her connection with Putellas’s sumptuous cross highlighted Spain’s very real threat. But, on this evidence, Tomé’s team do not look unbeatable, let alone unplayable.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballItaly women's football teamSpain women's football teammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Liverpool deliberately timed the announcement at 20:20 BST on Friday.The decision to retire the shirt was made after consultation with Jota’s wife, Rute Cardoso, and parents, Isabel and Joaquim, who travelled to Merseyside on Friday to witness the outpouring of affection for the striker and the tributes left outside Anfield. Jota’s family were accompanied to the stadium by the entire Liverpool squad as they made their first public appearance since the tragic accident.Jota died just 11 days after his marriage to his long-term partner and left behind three young children. He and his brother were understood to be driving to Santander to take a ferry back to England before pre-season training, having been advised not to fly following a recent lung procedure.Liverpool will play their first game since the accident at Preston on Sunday, when both clubs will pay a number of tributes to Jota and his brother.

They really neededthat displayagainst the Netherlands and it was a pivotal moment for them. It was a very, very commanding performance.Physically, they showed their dominance and exposed the Netherlands’ weaknesses at the back. With Lauren James, in what I think is her best position, playing from the right and being able to drift in, you can maintain your midfield structure. Her performance showed whySarina Wiegmanhas selected her and the team performance showed why she stuck with the group that she did.England at Euro 2025: Wiegman gets key decisions right to give Lionesses hope | Tom GarryRead moreI want to give a special mention to Ella Toone, coming into the side. Tooney seems like she is in the most confident place she has ever been in. She seems ready to perform at the highest level, which bodes well for England. For me the standout performer is always Alessia Russo, with the way she connects, links up and is a constant threat. In addition she’s also a provider of goals for others. All in all that team performance has really reminded England of their levels they are capable of – and they know they have to sustain it.Now, with so many decisive matches on the horizon in the next few days, every team in this tournament will need to do everything they can to maintain harmony within their bubbles and recognise when individuals need a mental breather for a morning coffee or who needs an arm around their shoulder, and these are the times where your senior leaders step up.What I’ve learnt over the years is that if you get a bit of time off while you’re away with the team for so long, you must take it. You need to know how to top your own tank up and, when your tank starts to empty, it’s your responsibility to keep it full. Nobody else is going to do that for you, you have to do that for yourself. If I get a morning off, I like to go shopping, or if I’m in a new town I like to go sightseeing. I want memorable experiences.Sometimes I’ll go to a museum or get my nails done, but it always involves walking, I love walking. Or sometimes it’s about watching a film. Some others will simply want to go for a coffee or maybe they will want to spend their time with family if they can.View image in fullscreenLauren James was playing in her best position, drifting in from the right.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersAs coach you have to remember that everyone has their own different routines and that they are adults. I like to treat them like adults. Any player returning from international duty will tell you, the worst environments are the ones that create cabin fever, where you have to do everything together all the time, that’s when it can drive players mad. If you, figuratively speaking, strangle players during a tournament, that can have such a negative impact on performances. So I’m not a fan of seating plans or precisely fixed times when you all have to sit down for a meal.Then there’s social media. When you are away together as a group for a long time, if you’re too active on social media, it can have such a detrimental impact on the psyche for players and I strongly encourage a detox, for everybody, during that period where they – in an ideal world – have no interactions with social media for a month, and really lock in for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to try to win something like a major tournament.Somebody once advised me: ‘Don’t listen to someone you wouldn’t take advice from’I’ve seen what happens when players do look at social media too much during an intense period, and I don’t think it improves their position at all. On the plus side, though, those who have a healthy boundary with it during tournaments are usually the ones who perform. England had such a high after the Euros, and since then they’ll have had to deal with some of the negativity which comes with that growth. That is not fun and unfortunately some players will look at it, so I’d say the most important thing is to keep emphasising the importance of that “bubble”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have seen this week how well the Lionesses have responded.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman’s team selection was vindicated against the Netherlands.Photograph: Florencia Tan Jun/Uefa/Getty ImagesWhen we talk about bubbles, it’s about locking down, protecting everyone’s confidence, and not playing anything out in the public eye, so that nothing damages the team. Do things that don’t create any stress, keep it calm and keep it relaxed, because having 40 days together with the same people can be so intense. Naturally, you can irritate each other, but you also can be the best of friends. The key to it is consistency every day, because you’re going to lose games of football and you’re going to not play well occasionally. But are you set up to be able to cope with it? That’s always the burning question I have. In England’s case, Sarina has got a lot of experience of doing this and will be calm.Somebody once advised me: “Don’t listen to someone you wouldn’t take advice from.” People think they know what’s going on inside a team, without really knowing, and everyone has got an opinion. So as a coach, it’s lovely to just focus only on your team and not listen to others. Yes, you have press officers who will fill you in on what’s being said, but during my experience at the Olympics with the US, I had to think: “I may never have this experience again,” so I wanted us to make the most of it.You have to give everything you can to be the best you can be to perform every day. In this tournament, Spain, Germany and France all caught the eye too, and the reigning world champions look like the top team so far. For France, it was always a matter of not “if”, but “when” we would see them look strong. But can they do it for every game in the tournament? That remains to be seen. There are some fantastic teams in this tournament and the ones who get the bubble right will usually be the ones who succeed.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamWomen’s Euro 2025Sarina WiegmanWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

Local authorities had issued a heat warning and Fernández, who was conducting media duties before Chelsea faceParis Saint-Germainin Sunday’s final, saying that he needed treatment in the second half will heap pressure on Fifa to consider late kick-off times at the 2026 World Cup.“The heat is incredible,” Fernández said. “The other day I got a bit dizzy during a play. I had to lie down on the ground because I was really dizzy. Playing in this temperature is very dangerous, it’s very dangerous.“Moreover, for the spectacle, for the people who come to enjoy the stadium, for the people who watch it at home. The game, the speed of the game is not the same, everything becomes very slow. Well, let’s hope that next year they change the schedule, at least so that it remains a beautiful and attractive football spectacle, right?”Levi Colwill agreed that the heat has led to slower games. “If you turn the game into a basketball match in this heat, it’s not going to help anyone,” theChelseacentre-back said. “You have to control the ball way more, pick the right times to attack and try to score.”There was an attempt to ask Fernández, who spoke and fielded questions exclusively in Spanish, abouthim singing a homophobic and racist songafter Argentina’s Copa América triumph last year, but the 24-year-old did not appear to understand the question.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The tiny cameras, mounted on a referee’s ear to provide TV viewers with a unique view of the action, have been trialled by Fifa during the Club World Cup over the past month.The Premier League has held talks with the International Football Association Board (Ifab), which determines the laws of the game, about whether the trial can be extended to domestic competitions.If Ifab approval is given, Ref Cams could be trialled by the Premier League in its Summer Series tournament this month in the US, featuring Manchester United, Everton, West Ham and Bournemouth, with a view to potentially using them next season.US set to be host to biggest sporting events with guests it doesn’t want | Emma JohnRead moreThe introduction of Ref Cams in the league would have to be approved by the clubs, so it would not be ready for the start of the campaign, and even if adopted they may not be used in every game.Ref Cams would be welcomed by the Premier League’s rights holders, who have been impressed at its use by Dazn. A new £3bn domestic broadcast deal with Sky Sports and TNT Sports starts next season. The Premier League and Ifab declined to comment.Jarred Gillett wore a head-mounted Ref Cam during the Premier League match between Crystal Palace and Manchester United in a trial in May 2024, although footage was not broadcast during the game. The league trialled chest-mounted GoPro cameras, worn by Rob Jones and Peter Bankes in its US Summer Series two years ago without broadcasting the action during matches.At the Club World Cup, the Ref Cam footage has been used by Dazn to supply instant replays and has been shown on big screens at the stadiums. Other European leagues have also been impressed with the results, which take viewers closer to the action, showcasing the players’ speed and skill in real time.It involves referees wearing cameras on their right ear, connected to a microphone and transmitter which sends video to the broadcasters. Two wires – one for the camera and the other for a microphone – are on the back of the referee’s shirt and a transmitter is placed in a pocket of their shorts.Fifa tested other cameras before the Club World Cup, including some at chest level, but its referees committee concluded that the side of the ear provided the best perspective. Fifa has been happy with the Ref Cam trial and will hold discussions about using it at next year’s World Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Collina said the cameras had an additional benefit in helping referees and VARs, by showing when the official has not had clear sight of a major incident. In a group game between Paris Saint-Germain and Atlético Madrid, for example, the referee did not see a handball incident by an Atlético defender because a player blocked his line of vision.“The video assistant referee alerted the referee, who awarded a penalty to Paris Saint-Germain after reviewing the incident on the pitch side monitor,” Collina said. “The system is working.”Explore more on these topicsFootballRefereesClub World Cup 2025US sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

We were bowling with the ball we were given and that’s how it is.”England v India: third men’s cricket Test, day two – liveRead moreBut Root sympathised with the task facing Dukes, who hand-produce the balls used in Test matches in England. “This summer has been a bit of an anomaly for us. We’re not used to getting this much sun and this much heat, getting the squares as hard and firm and the outfields as firm,” he said. “If the balls are going out of shape you change them and you don’t make a big deal out of it. I don’t think it’s the end of the world. You’ve got to be skilful enough to adapt to the changes, whether it stops swinging or starts swinging or does a little bit more.“I personally think that you give each team three challenges every 80 overs and that’s it. That would be a nice way of compromising and saying it’s not all on the manufacturer. Sometimes these things happen. But you can’t just keep asking and wasting time, slowing the game down.”For England the day was more memorable for someone who speeds the game up, with Jofra Archer returning to Test cricket after a four-year absence and producing the fastest spell of bowling seen in the series so far, and by taking the wicket of Yashasvi Jaiswal with his third ball.View image in fullscreenJoe Root broke the record for number of catches by an outfielder in Tests when he caught Karun Nair off the bowling of Ben Stokes.Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images“It was just genuine joy, seeing him back playing Test cricket,” Root said. “The impact he has on the group is huge in the dressing room, but also out on the field. Clearly he’s an X-factor player. Big games, he turns up and he does things that other players can’t. It was great to see him back smiling, enjoying his cricket, and making a huge impact.“When you got that about you where you can get a whole crowd up and creating a noise and atmosphere like that, you’ve clearly got something special. Just to see him running in, bowling at that pace, maintaining that pace as well, was great. I’m just excited for him.”The day also featured Root completing his 37th Test century and taking a superb catch at slip, a world record 211th in Test cricket, to dismiss Karun Nair. At stumps India were 145 for three, still 242 behind England’s first-innings total.“I think it’s going to be quite turgid, quite slow scoring, a slightly more old-school kind of Test match,” Root said. “I think we’ve got a great opportunity tomorrow if we can get a couple of wickets. Batting last on that surface could be quite tricky if we get things right.”Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025Joe RootEngland cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve proven that this year. But playing best of five, particularly this year, has been a real struggle for me physically. The longer the tournament goes, the worse the condition gets. I reached the semis of every slam this year, but I have to play Sinner or [Carlos] Alcaraz. These guys are fit, young, sharp. I feel like I’m going into the match with the tank half empty. It’s just not possible to win a match like that.“It is what it is, you know? It’s one of these things I accept and embrace in some way, deal with the reality the way it is, and try to make the most out of it, I guess.”Despite his struggles, Djokovic said he did not believe this would be his final appearance atWimbledonand he intends to return next year. “Hopefully it’s not my last match on the Centre Court,” he said. “I’m not planning to finish my Wimbledon career today. So I’m planning to come back definitely at least one more time, play on the Centre Court for sure.”For Sinner, the victory means that he has now reached the final of the past four grand slam tournaments.

He is being held without bond, according to jail records.Why doesn’t boxing care about gender-based violence? | Bryan Armen GrahamRead morePolice say the WorldBoxingAssociation lightweight boxing champion went to his former girlfriend’s home in Doral on the night of 15 June to pick up their two children. An argument escalated into a physical confrontation, during which Davis allegedly hit the woman in the back of the head and slapped her in the face as she reached into his car. The slap caused a minor cut to her lip, according to the arrest report.The victim sent a text to her mother during the incident, saying Davis was assaulting her. When the mother came outside, she saw her daughter crying and arguing with Davis. Police say cellphone video taken by the mother shows Davis throwing a small box at the victim.Davis declined to sign a Miranda warning form when questioned by police. He was charged with battery causing bodily harm. His bond is “to be set”, according to jail records.The arrest is the latest in a series of legal issues for Davis. He was previouslycharged with domestic battery in 2020after forcibly removing the mother of his child from her seat at a basketball game in Coral Gables. That incident, captured on video, showed Davis grabbing her by the neck and was followed by allegations he struck her off-camera. He turned himself in and posted bail but denied the accusations.In 2022, Davis was accused of slapping another woman in a separate domestic dispute, though the alleged victim later recanted. He also pleaded guilty in 2023 to four traffic offenses stemmingfrom a 2020 hit-and-run crashin Baltimore that injured four people, including a pregnant woman. He served 90 days under house arrest and was ordered to perform community service.Davis (30-0-1, 28 KOs) was reportedly in discussions for a rematch against Lamont Roach Jr on 16 August in Las Vegas, followingtheir controversial draw in March. No official announcement had been made before Friday’s arrest, which now casts doubt over the timing of his return to the ring.Explore more on these topicsGervonta DavisBoxingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The double Wimbledon champion survived the might and spite of Taylor Fritz’s serve, as well as the 31C heat, to bookhis place against Jannik Sinnerin the men’s final.But what a struggle this semi-final turned out to be. At one point, as Fritz smashed 135mph serves and howitzer forehands for fun past him, Alcaraz was just one point away from a fifth set. But, as usual, he somehow found a way to flip the narrative and emerge triumphant.Near-perfect Alcaraz puts on masterclass in doing whatever it takes to win | Simon CambersRead more“It was a really difficult match,” the Spaniard admitted after his 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (6) victory. “Even tougher with the conditions. And with the pressure of a semi-final it was not easy.”Some have suggested thatWimbledonhas been on the slow side this year. But this semi-final had the rattle and hum of an old-fashioned grass-courter. The serve was dominant, the points short, the margins slim.But perhaps the biggest surprise of all was that Alcaraz, so often tennis’s greatest showman, resembled a serve bot. He won 88% of points on his first serve. And, staggeringly, also claimed 31 out of 41 points at the net. Squint and it could almost have been Pistol Pete Sampras in his prime.“I was just serving really good,” admitted Alcaraz. “And I won a lot of serve and volley points today, just not letting the opponent get into the point, to get a good rhythm.”Fritz gave it everything, of course. And if a point or two had gone differently, who knows what might have been. But the American, as good as he is, continues to have two noticeable deficiencies.The first is that he does not enjoy hitting his backhand down the line. And despite being 6ft 5in with a long wingspan, he regards coming to the net with the same suspicion as a vegetarian might approach an Argentinian steakhouse.Alcaraz, meanwhile, has the canny ability to absorb his opponent’s power and, like the Marvel superhero Rogue, use it against them. That much was evident from the opening point. Fritz sent down a 135mph thunderbolt, only for Alcaraz to return it with interest, pin his opponent back and then win the point with an exquisite drop shot.The Spaniard went on to break immediately, thanks to a net cord, before racing through the first set in 36 minutes. Incredibly, at this point he had won 15 out of 15 points after his first serve went in.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz rips a forehand towards Taylor Fritz in their semi-final.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I’ve watched Carlos plenty,” Fritz said. “For me, I feel like that’s the best I’ve seen him serve. He has so much raw power, and I don’t move like he does, so he can hurt me.”But Fritz, who had the muscle memory of winning two recent tournaments on grass, at Stuttgart and Eastbourne, wasn’t going to make it easy.He finally earned his first break point at 4-3 in the second set, when Alcaraz was distracted by two delays caused by spectators collapsing and needing treatment. And while the Spaniard clung on, at 6-5 he was unable to stop Fritz breaking him to love to make it one-set all.The momentum seemed to be with the American. But having won the first game on serve, he was broken to love in the process of losing 13 points in a row. A second break followed as the Spaniard took the third set 6-3.But Fritz again refused to wilt. The fourth set rushed by with a succession of easy holds until we were into a tie-break. Alcaraz struck first with a mini-break, set up with a drop shot and a lob combination, and went 4-1 ahead. But with the finishing line in sight, Fritz found a response.View image in fullscreenTaylor Fritz battled valiantly but faced an opponent with greater variety.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHe pulled it back to 4-3 with two big serves, then thundered a rare backhand winner down the line and hit a big forehand to make it 5-4. A 140mph serve took it to 6-4 and, from nowhere, he had two set points.Alcaraz saved the first by somehow returning a 134mph serve. Then, inspired by the Centre Court crowd, he raced through the next three points to claim victory in just under three hours.A couple of hours later, Alcaraz learned he would face Sinner in a rematch oftheir epic French Open final.“He’s going to take a lot of things from the French Open final, that he’s going to be better,” warned the Spaniard. “He’s going to be better physically, he’s going to be better mentally. He’s going to be prepared on Sunday to give his 100%.“I’m not thinking I have advantage mentally because of that match.”Perhaps. But this will be Alcaraz’s sixth grand slam final, a deeply impressive feat given he turned 22 in May. And the bad news for Sinner? The Spaniard has won the previous five.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025TennisWimbledonCarlos AlcarazUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Bradley’srecent winon the PGA Tour means he is poised to take on a dual role as the US tries to regain the cup from Europe at Bethpage in September. Advantage Europe?A year ago at the Scottish Open,McIlroy insistedthe concept of a playing captain was a seriously flawed one. After posting a 65 on Friday to fire himself into contention at the tournament’s 2025 edition, McIlroy addressed the same issue with a laugh. “Hopefully it is impossible,” he said of a playing captain.The Open organisers agree to use of Spidercam on 18th green at PortrushRead moreMcIlroy was more serious when in praise of Bradley. “Keegan has played great, he’s had a great year. I’m not in those conversations and, from an outside perspective, it’s going to be interesting to see what the US team does with that.“I definitely think the US team is better with Keegan playing than not playing. He’s one of the best 12 American players right now. It’s going to be an interesting couple of months to see how that all shakes out.”McIlroy’s broader assessment of the scenario was more striking. In Europe, Luke Donald is heavily empowered as the captain. “It’s a different perspective, absolutely,” McIlroy said. “It really feels like it’s a player-led team in America. We have our input as players on the European team, but we do have that one figurehead in Luke. I think that’s important.“Even going backto Rome, when the Americans got off to a pretty rough start, because Zach [Johnson] gave the team so much ownership they had no one to look to. They were looking at each other instead of having a focal point: ‘Tell us what to do.’ That is something Europe has done very, very well. But also the players have allowed the captain to be a captain as well.”View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy shot a 65 in his second round at the Scottish Open.Photograph: Warren Little/Getty ImagesMcIlroy’s five-under-par round and minus-seven total at the Renaissance Club means he is four adrift of Chris Gotterup, who carded a stunning 61. Matt Fitzpatrick’s 63 moved him to eight under.“I am excited for the weekend right in the thick of things, in contention going into the last two days,” McIlroy said. “You know that’s where, if there is anything you need to work on in your game, it’s going to show when you’re under that sort of pressure trying to win . I’m looking forward to that.”Golf’s official world-ranking body has confirmed LIV has resubmitted a bid to be included in the system. Players on the LIV Tour have been unable to earn ranking points since its inception in 2022.“LIV’s application will be reviewed in accordance with OWGR’s criteria to ensure fairness, integrity and consistency,” said Trevor Immelman, the chair of the rankings board.Explore more on these topicsRyder CupRory McIlroyGolfUS sportsLIV Golf SeriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The same scoreline happened again, a few weeks later, against the Czech Republic. A suddenly doubtful media dubbed the former Real Madrid boss ‘Oh Dae-yong,’ a Korean-sounding name that translates as ‘5-0’.The following summer at the 2002 World Cup, however, the Koreans were beating Portugal, Italy and Spain on the way to a semi-final exit against Germany. The coach was made an honorary citizen, every restaurant in Seoul claimed a past visit and universities were designing new modules about what to learn from his leadership.US men to play South Korea, Japan in September friendlies with World Cup loomingRead morePochettino could do worse than try a crash course from the source and give Hiddink a call to chat about what he did during that period between the summers of 2001 and 2002. Indeed, Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio did more than that ahead of the 2018 World Cup, visiting the Netherlands to talk to the man himself to try to find an edge that would takeEl Tripast the second round. After all, ahead of the 2002 semi-final,the Guardian wrote: “None of the other participating 31 teams have approached the competition with the same level of preparation, professionalism and common sense, which is a tribute to their coach Guus Hiddink.”The situations between the 2002 and 2026 co-hosts are, of course, a little different, but there are some notable similarities. Hiddink took over South Korea with 18 months to go until the big occasion; Pochettino will have been in charge just three months longer than that when the 2026 edition kicks off. Mildly encouraging performances at the Gold Cup is another thing they have in common. It is little remembered now but South Korea appeared at Concacaf’s bash in 2000 and 2002 in search of competitive games.Hiddink was not in charge for the first, when Korea failed to advance past an equal group stage thanks to a coin toss loss to Canada. In 2002, the Koreans just got a single point behind the perfect Americans but, this time, went through, then got past Mexico on penalties before losing to Costa Rica in the semi-final. There were encouraging signs – a clean sheet against Mexico and penalty heroics from goalkeeper Lee Woon-jae, who would go on to star in the following summer, but still plenty of questions about a lack of goals.View image in fullscreenMauricio Pochettino was forced to call a roster absent of many stars for the Gold Cup, where they lost in the final to Mexico.Photograph: Ashley Landis/APYet for Hiddink it was not about results but progress. The Dutchman was open about wanting a team that was as fit and fresh, two words that came up often, as possible. To work harder than any other team was always the goal and he said with pride during the World Cup that this team was the fittest of any he had coached before, including his Netherlands side which, ironically, beat Korea 5-0 at the 1998 World Cup.It helped that Hiddink had massive control, partly due to his status and partly due to a fear of failure. TheTaeguk Warriorshad been to five World Cups and had never won a game, despite coming close, and were desperate to get out of the group stage. Having a co-host or two can also help. The presence of Japan was a huge incentive as Korea was competing with its former coloniser on and off the field. Perhaps President Trump’s attitudes towards Canada and Mexico can at least foster some competitive feelings among the co-hosts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is easier to do so when 16 out of the 23 in the final roster are based domestically in a country roughly the size of Indiana, and most of the rest are just a quick flight away in Japan. Hiddink broke up cliques that formed around the strict age hierarchy within the team, a bigger deal back then than now, with divisions these days more likely to be between those based at home and those in Europe.Hiddink always knew that the domestic-based talent were crucial. With the 2002 World Cup kicking off in late May, earlier than usual due to the rainy season, most of the best teams were full of players that came straight from their European campaigns. The K-League season, which usually starts in February or March, was delayed until July, meaning that the upon returning from the Gold Cup, the coach had his players as much as he wanted. The international calendar is going to limit Poch’s time with his entire roster but working as much as possible with what you have can make a difference.It should not be forgotten that Korea was also a technically excellent team but, there is no denying that, it was also fitter and fresher than perhaps any in World Cup history. By 4 June 2002, the team was a coiled spring, desperate to play in front of an army of red-clad fans desperate for them to do well and a country ready to create an unforgettable atmosphere. The 2-0 win over Poland was not just a first in Korea’s World Cup history, did not just fire the starting gun for an incredible summer but showed how a team had been built in a short space of time.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaUSAUS sportsWorld Cup 2026World Cup 2002World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is the third breach of LVMH’s systems in the last three months.As well as the two attacks onLouis Vuitton, LVMH’s second-largest fashion label, Christian Dior Couture, said in May that hackers had accessed some customer data.On Thursday,four people were arrestedas part of an investigation into cyber-attacks on Marks & Spencer, the Co-op and Harrods.Those arrested were a 17-year-old British boy from the West Midlands, a 19-year-old Latvian man from the West Midlands, a 19-year-old British man from London and a 20-year-old British woman from Staffordshire.M&S was thefirst retailer to be attacked, in April, in an incident that forced the closure of its online store for nearly seven weeks. The Co-op was attacked in the same month and forced to shut down parts of its IT system.Harrods said on 1 May it had been targeted, and restricted internet access across its websites after attempts to gain unauthorised access to its systems.The arrests came days after the M&S chair, Archie Norman, told MPs that two other large British companies had been affected by unreported cyber-attacks in recent months, as he gave details of the “traumatic” attack on the retailer.Louis Vuitton has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeLouis VuittonConsumer affairsData and computer securityRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Summer heatwaves are so frequent, they’re stretching the bounds of what we think of as summer. Hot-and-bothered home working and sweaty, sleepless nights are now alarmingly common.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Get a good fan, and you can dodge the temptation of air conditioning. Air con is incredibly effective, but it uses a lot of electricity … and burning fossil fuels is how we got into this mess in the first place. Save money and carbon by opting for a great fan instead.Fans are much more energy efficient than air con. A typical portable air conditioner uses 1,000W of electricity, which would cost about 26p an hour to run. The fans I tested used between 8W and 60W; my favourite, the AirCraft Lume, used 18W on its top setting. You could run it on max for 56 hours, and it would still use no more electricity (money, carbon) than a single air con unit going for an hour.I tested 14 fans of all shapes and sizes, so you can pick the best one for you. I tested them for size, noise, power use and, of course, how much they cool you down. I also tested a few “evaporative coolers”, which use water to cool the air blowing at you while using significantly less energy than air con.Due to recent heatwaves, stock is running low on some models – we’ve marked up any that are out of stock at the time of publication.At a glanceBest fan overall:AirCraft Lume£149 at AirCraftBest tower fan:Dreo Cruiser TF518£99.99 at AmazonBest travel fan:Morphy Richards Air Flex USB fan£39.99 at AmazonBest evaporative cooler:Swan Nordic air cooler£69.99 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI’m an award-winning consumer tech journalist with decades of experience testing gadgets. I’m also a menopausal woman in her 50s who honestly can’t remember the last time she felt cold: I think that might be why we gravitate towild swimmingin middle age. Oh, and I have a degree in engineering. So I’m triply qualified to put these fans through their paces, scientifically and subjectively.How I testedView image in fullscreenAn anemometer was used to measure the air speed each fan generates on its top setting.Photograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianI chose 14 fans, each from different brands, aiming for a mix of new and highly rated models plus a few stellar bargains. I wanted to make sure there was something for everyone before I put them through their paces.I used a power meter to measure how much electricity (and therefore money and carbon) the fans use, an anemometer to measure the air speed they generate on the top setting, and the Sound Meter app to measure the noise on the top setting (they were all too quiet to register on their lowest).I measured everything from 1m away, although in reality, you’ll probably position a tower or pedestal fan farther away and a desk fan closer to you. That means the noise a desk fan makes matters more.I also measured them myself, as sometimes the official specs can be misleading or wrong. For example, I measured a tower fan that was supposedly 17cm wide, only to find that wasn’t including the base. Here I’ve stuck with each fan’s largest dimensions, including their footprint.I used a thermometer to measure the impact of the evaporative coolers I tested, and took note of everything from how cooling each of the fans felt, how annoying the noise was and how good the controls were. I also considered how they looked and how small they packed away, as well as the price tag.All the fans that weren’t returned to the manufacturers were donated toFurnishing Futures, a charity that furnishes the empty social homes in which women and children are placed after domestic abuse.The best fans in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianBest fan overall:AirCraft LumeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£149 at AirCraftPreorder now for delivery during week commencing 11 AugustThis pedestal fan was hard to fault, with an elegant design that boasts a dimmable backlight (three brightness levels or you can turn it off, all with the remote control). It’s billed as height adjustable, but rather than scooting up and down, you can remove the bottom pole to convert it into a 63cm desk fan. There’s an LED display and touch controls on the front, and other features include a 12-hour timer and a sleep mode.Of all I tested, this is probably the best fan for sleeping: it’s the best for low noise relative to wind speed. Pick a lower setting for silent cooling, a higher setting if you’re happy to doze off to the white noise, or use the sleep button if you’d like it to gradually reduce power in the night. I found the lower settings cooling enough to get to sleep on a hot night during a heatwave.Why we love itWhen I’m working from home or relaxing (I can’t say chilling out when it’s 30C+), the AirCraft Lume is the fan that I reach for. I love it for many reasons. It’s light but with a reassuringly heavy base, giving it Weeble-like stability: it’s difficult to knock over. It packs away pretty small for the winter because the pole comes apart. I also liked that the packaging is almost plastic-free.It oscillates both horizontally and vertically, so it can circulate air nicely around a whole room. Most importantly of all, this fan can really shift air – its 5.9m/s (metres a second) result was the best on test, and you can really feel it. During a recent heatwave, I found the powerful breeze genuinely cooling. And it’s quiet: in fact, I can’t hear it at all on levels 1-5, so I need to be careful that I remember to turn off the fan when I step away. All for a reasonable price, too.It’s a shame that …there’s nowhere to stow the remote control when it’s not in use.Style:pedestal (or desk)Dimensions:37 x 28 x 95cm (WDH)Number of speeds:12Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:55dBPower use on top setting:18WAir speed on top setting:5.9 metres a second (m/s)Beat the heat: 14 expert tips for keeping cool in hot weatherRead moreBest budget fan and best desk fan:DevoladeskfanView image in fullscreen£59.95 at Devola£59.95 at AirconCentreCurrently out of stockThis affordable desk fan punches well above its weight, with good features and powerful airflow. It has a display, touch controls, a remote, a timer and sleep mode. You can choose vertical oscillation (90 degrees), horizontal oscillation (80 degrees) or use both to circulate the air in a room. Not bad for a humble desk fan.Why we love itIt’s a bargain powerhouse, producing a substantial wind. I measured an air speed of 4m/s, which was among the best on test. It certainly felt cooling.I couldn’t hear the Devola on the first three of its nine speeds, despite being powerfully cooling, and even when the noise got louder on higher settings, it wasn’t too annoying. In fact, while the AirCraft Lume is my favourite bedside fan, the Devola perched on a bedside table does a good job on a budget. It’s powerfully cooling, inaudible on lower settings (1-3 out of 9) and on high settings, the white noise is OK to go to sleep to. Just don’t use the sleep setting: it’s noisier than it should be, so picking a medium setting worked best. Even the high settings provide a level of white noise I could go to sleep to.It’s a shame that …the display is on the base facing upwards, so you can’t see it unless you’re nearby. There was no instruction manual in the box, either, although I found it straightforward to use.Style:deskDimensions:30 x 21 x 31cm (WDH)Number of speeds:9Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:50dBPower use on top setting:16WAir speed on top setting:4m/sBest tower fan:Dreo Cruiser TF518View image in fullscreen£99.99 at Amazon£109.99 with wifi voice control at B&QThis tower fan is slim but striking in black. Features include 90-degree oscillation, a 0- to 12-hour timer, a sleep mode where the fan speed decreases gradually, and an auto mode that adapts the fan speed depending on the room temperature.Why we love itAt full blast, the Dreo felt positively windy and was definitely cooling on a hot day. On the two lowest settings, no sound was audible, but I could still feel a gentle breeze. I also liked the recess at the top-back that makes it easy to carry with one hand.It’s billed as a “25dB silent bladeless fan”, but I measured 60dB on top whack from a metre away. The sound wasn’t too annoying, though, and the fan’s powerful cooling made it forgivable.It’s a shame that …its energy consumption is relatively high. We’re talking pennies in electricity, but still, energy efficiency is good. Also, there’s nowhere to clip the remote control.Style:towerDimensions:32 x 32 x 106cm (WDH)Number of speeds:9Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:60dBPower use on top setting:29WAir speed on top setting:3.6m/sBest travel fan:Morphy Richards Air FlexUSBfanView image in fullscreen£39.99 at Amazon£39.99 at Robert DyasThis is the fan you can take with you anywhere. I don’t mean to fan yourself by hand: it folds down small and it’s cordless and USB rechargeable, so you can be the smuggest person on the train and a very happy camper on a hot day. It can also give you a breeze on a still day on the patio. The battery will last from four to 17 hours, depending on fan speed. And you can plug it into a laptop at your desk or even apower bankfor more juice.Why we love itThe 2.6m/s air speed can’t compete with the big fans on test – and it wasn’t the one I reached for during a heatwave – but that’s not what it’s for. It’s an electric fan that can go anywhere, folding down to a cylinder measuring 18 x 18 x 12cm. You can even hang it on the wall, if you wish. It’s rechargeable and you can even use it with aUSB power bankto keep it running anywhere, so you can cool down in a tent or on the train. Far better than a handheld fan. I’d definitely take this fan on holiday.There’s no timer or sleep mode, but there’s a “nature mode” that varies the speed to mimic a breeze. And it does oscillate (to 90 degrees). It’s also quiet: I couldn’t hear it on the first of its three speeds, and it was never loud enough to be annoying.It’s a shame that …air speed dips slightly when it’s not plugged in, but only slightly (2.5m/s instead of 2.6m/s)Style:deskDimensions:18 x 18 x 22cm (WDH)Number of speeds:3Remote control?NoPeak noise level on test:35dBPower use on top setting:8WAir speed on top setting:2.6m/sBestevaporative cooler:SwanNordic air coolerView image in fullscreen£69.99 at SwanCurrently out of stock£69.99 at AmazonPreorder for delivery on 4 AugustThe air speed may not be great, but this Swan model is still a good buy because it’s an evaporative cooler, meaning it uses water from its five-litre reservoir to cool the air it blows at you. It can be used as a regular fan, too. Evaporative coolers are much more energy efficient than air conditioning, so they use much less power (and therefore less carbon, assuming you’re not on a renewable tariff or producing your own electricity).Why we love itOf the two evaporative coolers I tested, this worked the best. I could see the temperature on the thermometer go down: it cooled by more than 1C in less than 30 minutes. And it felt like a cooling breeze. In fact, it felt a bit like air con.I just filled it with water, but it comes with two ice packs that you can pre-freeze and throw into the reservoir for even colder results.The breeze felt wide, rather than focused. This is a question of personal taste: some people want a powerful fan that’s focused to blast just them, while others prefer a room-filling breeze. In oscillating mode, it’s wider still, as the grille at the front rotates, which is a bit hypnotic. It’s good-looking, too, in a coffee-coloured oatmeal or grey finish. It’s light and on casters, so easy to move around, and its modes include normal, natural, sleep and timer.It’s a shame that …you can hear the water in the pipes: it sounded like a leak. You might even find yourself needing the loo. I also found myself reaching for a fan on a hot day – it provides a light breeze, not a blast of wind. But the air that it puts out is genuinely cooler than the rest of the air in the room.Style:towerDimensions:29 x 24 x 71cm (WDH)Number of speeds:24Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:45dBPower use on top setting:26WAir speed on top setting:0.9m/sThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianLevoit classic tower fanView image in fullscreen£89.99 at AmazonPreorder for delivery on 29 July-26 AugustBest for:a quieter tower fanThis produces a narrow beam of air, so you need to point it at you just right or set it to oscillate (90 degrees).

But it’s hard to categorise: too short for a tower fan, too tall for a desk fan.There’s a timer and it oscillates horizontally (71 degrees) and vertically (180 degrees), though it’s hard to imagine why you’d want to point it completely down.

Its swing mode moves horizontally, and you can manually move the grilles to angle the air up or down. It’s on casters, too.I liked its large (10-litre) water capacity and how quiet it was, but the fan wasn’t strong enough, and the evaporative mode wasn’t cold enough. I tried it several times, and in half an hour, it never managed to cool the area in front by a degree.It didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t cool the room down enough.Style:tower;dimensions:31 x 30 x 75cm (WDH);number of speeds:3;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:30dB;power use on top setting:39W;air speed on top setting:1.8m/sShark TurboBlade TF200SUKView image in fullscreen£250 at Argos£249.99 at AmazonBest for:pointing in two directions at onceThis bladeless fan’s unusual T-shaped design has arms that stick out left and right, each putting out air, or you can turn them by 90 degrees for a tall, thin fan. You can angle each arm independently, good for pointing at two people. It’s height-adjustable and can oscillate (180 degrees) horizontally too. I liked that the remote attaches to the top with a strong magnet.It’s powerful, but the sound is very annoying: it sounds like a vacuum cleaner, and I wanted it to stop. It also used the most power on test; even still, a 60W fan costs less than 2p an hour to run at the current energy price cap, so it’s pennies compared with air con.It didn’t make the final cut because …I hated the noise it makes.Style:pedestal;dimensions:80 x 30 x 78-95cm (WDH), or 124 x 30 x 114-130cm in vertical mode;number of speeds:10;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:35dB;power use on top setting:60W;air speed on top setting:3.1m/sDuux Whisper Flex 2View image in fullscreen£179.99 at AmazonBest for:smart controlsThis took quite a bit of assembly, but it’s good-looking, can be converted into a 54cm-high desk fan by removing a pole, and the tech is clever too. You can control it with an app or by voice (Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant) to set up to seven schedules. There’s an optional battery and charging dock to make it cordless.It’s fairly quiet and oscillates well, vertically and horizontally, but I found the standard controls annoying. The display on the base points upwards, so it’s hard to see from across the room, and you have to point the remote very accurately at it.I did like the compostable packaging. But unusually, it drew far too much power (2W) on standby.

The magnetic storage on top for the remote control is clever. The controls work well and let you easily set the timer and sleep mode.I couldn’t hear this bladeless fan on the first six of its 10 speeds, and I found the noise easy to live with even at higher speeds.It didn’t make the final cut because …the price is hard to justify.

Its three-year warranty is a bonus, too (most have two).Overall, I liked it. It’s good-looking and pretty strong, although it’s weaker when cordless; for example, air speed dropped from an impressive 4.6m/s to 3.1m/s when I unplugged it.

They don’t have to be old-fashioned; some have modern designs. And some are convertible, with a pole you can remove to turn them into a desk fan. They can be good for a focused blast of cooling wind.Bladeless fansaren’t magic; they just don’t have visible blades. The work is done in the body of the fan, and then air is pushed out of a nozzle. The Dyson, VortexAir and Shark on test are all bladeless. They look modern and are easy to clean. And there are no moving parts on show, meaning zero chance of getting your hair caught.Tower fansare tall and narrow. They produce a lot of wind and oscillate from side to side, making them good for a room like an office.Desk fansare like pedestal fans without the pole. They’re not only for desks, they’re good on a bedside table too. And they take up less storage space over the winter.Evaporative coolersuse water from a reservoir to cool the air that blows at you. They don’t produce a powerful wind like a fan, but they genuinely cool the room and are much more energy efficient than air conditioning. Note that they only cool the room a little – they won’t turn it fridge cold like air con.What does oscillation mean?Most fans oscillate (move back and forth) by swivelling on their base, and some let you select how wide an angle you want. If it’s just for you, pick a narrow angle; if you’re cooling the whole office, go wide. Some fans achieve the same effect in other ways, such as by moving louvres. Some also oscillate up and down, so the fan can circulate air all over the room to create a gentle breeze.What’s sleep mode?Most fans have a sleep mode, where every 30 or 60 minutes the fan lowers its setting until it reaches a certain point. This is a good compromise that helps you get to sleep without wasting energy, minimising the risk of waking up in the middle of the night suddenly cold.Start by lowering the fan speed to the point where you don’t find it annoying. In fact, some people find the white noise of a fan helpful at bedtime. Then switch to sleep mode.The best sleep aids recommended by experts: from blue light-blockers to apps to help you napRead moreWhere is the best place to position a fan?For personal comfort, simply point it towards you. The cooling feeling is because the moving air from the fan displaces the warm, humid air near your skin, which in turn helps your sweat evaporate, cooling your body down. It’s like a breeze rather than a still day. Or why it feels colder swimming in a river than in a lake, even if the water temperature is the same. Evaporative coolers, of which I’ve included two above, use water to actively cool the air.Never place a fan up against a wall because air needs to flow into the back. If the air’s cooler outside, put the fan in front of an open window or door to bring in the cooler air.How much does a fan cost to use?I’ll set out the maths. For each fan here, I’ve measured its power use on the top setting, in watts (W). Electricity costs are in kilowatt hours (kWh). If, for example, you were using a 30W fan for five hours, it would use 150Wh. Divide by 1,000 to convert it to kilowatt hours: 0.150kWh.The energy price cap for 1 July to 30 September 2025 is 25.73p per kWh. Multiply this by the last figure and you’ll discover it will cost just under 4p to run that fan for five hours. Or £14 to run it for five hours every day for a year.Running fans is pretty cheap, then, and a good fan will keep you cool enough to dodge buying any kind of air conditioning. An evaporative cooler is a good alternative to air con. The two I tested used 26W (Swan) and 39W (Honeywell), so they use about 3% of the electricity of a typical portable air conditioner (1,000W). The effect isn’t the same: you can’t turn your bedroom into a fridge. But you can cool the air enough to make a big difference when there’s a heatwave.Do I need air conditioning?If you’re in the UK, honestly, no. It’s tempting to turn your bedroom into a walk-in fridge on a hot day, but fans are great and use much less electricity (and therefore money and carbon) than air con. Unless you’re on a renewable tariff, electricity use accelerates climate breakdown.Caramel Quin is ajournalist specialising in consumer technology.

The second that Ace of Spades comes on over a montage of skaters on the title screen, I am forcefully yanked back to the early 00s, when I spent untold hours playing one Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater game or another in the gross bedrooms of my teen-boy friends. More than 20 years later, I can almost smell the acrid lingering odour of Lynx body spray.In 2020, the first couple of Tony Hawk’s games were polished up and re-released as the first wave of Y2K nostalgia hit. The two games were packaged up as one, with consistent controls and a new look that preserved the grungy feel of the originals, and the same is true for 3+4: levels, skaters and parks from both 2001’s THPS3 and 2002’s THPS4 rock up here alongside newer stars of the sport (including Riley Hawk, son of the eponymous skating celebrity – I found this oddly touching).View image in fullscreen‘You can string together insane and risky combos.’Photograph: ActivisionI remember these places so well – the factory, the college campus, the snow-dusted Canadian skate park, the time capsule of central London. Weirdly, the zoo level is now empty of animals (why?), but otherwise these compact arrangements of grindable, trickable urban obstacle courses are very much as they were. (The skater-punk soundtrack, unfortunately, isnotas it was – there are a great many omissions, a disappointment only partly softened by a slew of new tracks.) Between grabs, spins, flips and manuals you can string together insane and risky combos across their entire geography, skidding across power lines, along walls and finding hidden half-pipes.Watch a trailer for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4I donotremember all of this being so hard, however. My first few hours with these games were a humiliation, as I grappled with the controller and baled over and over again trying to meet even the minimum required scores in each two-minute run. Was I always this bad at these games? Whatever muscle memory I once had is gone, but I am slowly building up a respectable set of virtual-skating skills again. There are more complex moves and traversal tricks to keep in mind here than there were in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2, which is a more arcadey experience, and a better place to start if you weren’t there for these games the first time round.Like the real sport, it’s about perseverance and repetition: when the combos started to flow again for me after a few hours, it felt sofreeing. I still don’t think there’s a better skating game out there than old-school Tony Hawk’s, even after all this time – and there’s certainly no better time capsule of this pivotal moment in the history of the sport.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 is out July 11; £39.99Explore more on these topicsGamesSports gamesSkateboardingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Bands including Less Than Jake, the Ataris and AFI pay tribute to a gaming megastar who loves them backTom ReganFri 11 Jul 2025 05.40 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 19.22 EDTShareWhen millions of parents bought their kids a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater game in the late 90s and early 00s, they couldn’t have understood the profound effect it would have on their children’s music taste. With bands from Bad Religion to Papa Roach and Millencolin accompanying every failed spin and grind, these trick-tastic games slyly doubled up as the ultimate compilation CD.While the Fifa games have an equally storied history with licensed music, those soundtracks feel impersonal – a who’s who of whichever artists EA’s associated record labels wanted to push at the time. Pro Skater’s soundtrack, by contrast, felt like being handed a grubby and slightly dog-eared handmade mixtape, still battered from its last tumble at the local skate park.“Most of the bands were chosen because I heard them growing up at the skate park. I would say most of the original punk stuff – even the early hip-hop – that was my soundtrack to skating in the 80s and 90s,” Tony Hawk says. “I never imagined that I would be a tastemaker but, that was really just a byproduct of staying true to the culture.”“Tony was very involved in punk rock,” says Chris DeMakes, frontman of Less Than Jake, before his set at this year’s Slam Dunk festival. “Ultimately, he had to approve the bands on his soundtrack … So that always kind of made me feel good about it.” The band’s Roger Lima adds: “The culture of skating and music is so meshed, it made sense for them to have a real soundtrack to it.”For the bands that made it on to these games in those years, the impact was immeasurable. “I remember playing earlier versions of THPS and hearing some of our contemporaries … I hoped we’d get an opportunity like that,” says Hunter Burgan, bassist of AFI. “But I don’t think I really understood how big the impact was until after we actuallywereon the soundtrack. I can’t tell you how many people have come up to me over the last two decades and told me that THPS3 was their first introduction to AFI.”View image in fullscreen‘Tony had to approve the bands on his soundtrack so that made me feel good about it’ … Less Than Jake.Photograph: Piers Allardyce/Rex/Shutterstock“Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater made All My Best Friends Are Metalheads a hit – as big a hit as if we would have been on 60 major rock stations in America … Probablybigger,” says DeMakes. “I talked to John Feldman [of Goldfinger] about this recently, and with Superman it’s the same thing for them. That wasn’t a worldwide hit, but itbecamea hit for them because of that game.”When the original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater came out in 1999, those grey PlayStation discs served as a punk rock Trojan horse, sneaking a killer introduction to the world of alt and punk music to millions of unsuspecting kids. A quarter-century later, new artists are featuring on modern remakes of the Pro Skater games, alongside the bands that shaped their taste.“Those games fully altered my taste in music!” says Sammy Ciaramitaro, vocalist of hardcore band Drain. “They brought punk rock (and a lot of other incredible music) to my childhood bedroom.” Drain are now one of a handful of new artists that were chosen to be added to the soundtrack for the remakes.“I think our inclusion represents the growth of hardcore,” says Ciaramitaro. “I’m honored that we now get to be a part of this with Turnstile and End It, too. I hope that maybe some young kids will hear our songs while playing and it will motivate them to do a deep dive into punk rock music, like we all did when we were younger.”Other bands who weren’t quite big enough to get on Tony’s radar at the time, such as the Ataris, spent their careers dreaming of making it on to the next Pro Skater game. “We were coming of age the same time that Pro Skater was,” says bassist Mike Davenport. “In 1999/2000 was when we really started to take off as a band and we didn’t even feel as if we belonged with the bands that were featured [on the games].” The Ataris’ track All Souls’ Day eventually made the soundtrack for 2020’s Pro Skater 1+2 remake.Davenport says that the band used to play Pro Skater constantly on tour in the back of an RV – even, once, in the middle of a car accident. “My merch guy and I were playing in the kitchen nook one night when we heard the driver yell ‘look out!’ and then the TV flew at us, and we both literally batted it down with our hands so as not to have it smash us in the face,” he remembers. “Sadly the TV and PlayStation were killed, but luckily not us.”View image in fullscreenDavey Havok performing with AFI in 2007.Photograph: Reuters/AlamyEven though Less Than Jake reaped the rewards of being on the game back in 2002, returning with a different song on the Pro Skater remake decades later still felt like a badge of honour: “We’re a band that’s been around for 33 years, so we love anything that can propel us and get us in front of a new audience,” says DeMakes, “Everybody has social media. Anybody can upload their song to YouTube or Spotify or Apple Music now, it’s a different playing field. So how do you get noticed? Getting asked to be in a video game is perfect.”“As long as there are people playing video games there will be an avenue to connect them with music,” says Burgan, “Skateboarding, punk rock and video games were a huge part of our lives growing up and were inextricably connected, so it seems like a natural continuation of that. For bands, I think the cultural impact is far more important and lasting than any financial benefit.”Such is the lasting impact of the Pro Skater soundtracks that there are cover bands dedicated to playing it live – among them the 900. “We were really annoying when we first started the band, just tagging Tony Hawk in every story and Instagram post,” frontman Harry Shaw tells me. “When he followed us [on social media] we thought: ‘That’s it, we’ve made it.’ We never imagined that he’d actually come on stage with us.”In a video that’s since gone viral on Instagram,Tony Hawk hopped on stage unannouncedwith the 900 in east London, covering Bloodstains by Agent Orange and Superman by Goldfinger, to a rapturous crowd. “[We’re] eternally grateful for him doing that show, and also just not being a dick about bands covering songs from his game, either,” says Shaw, “He doesn’t have to do this stuff, his name is so big within pop culture – like Ronaldo or Messi – he’s almost like a living meme.”View image in fullscreen‘I can’t sing every song’ … Tony Hawk on stage with the 900 in London in 2022.Photograph: Doug Young“There are five bands that only play covers from our video game series, and I’ve sang with three of them. But that one [the 900] was really fun,” says Hawk. “My appearance was a surprise, and they were kind enough to choose songs that I was more into. Yes, I’m proud of the soundtrack, but I can’t sing every song nor could I remember the lyrics!”In the decades that have passed since the original Pro Skater games, their soundtracks have been the gift that keeps giving for the bands who make it on. “I actually just met Tony a few weeks ago at a music festival,” says AFI’s Burgan. “He is a true music lover and that makes being included in THPS even more special.”While Pro Skater has gone down in legend, Less Than Jake believes that it could have very easily gone the other way.“How many stars do we know that have made products or endorsed things that weren’t good?” laughs DeMakes. “But in Tony’s case, he had a really cool game that kids embraced and loved.”“Pro Skater could have been a flop, it could have just not really worked out in the long run,” agrees Lima. “But every element of it was just super effortlessly cool and it was huge for us … I can’t count the amount of times someone has said: “I found out about you guys through Pro Skater.” Just look at the YouTube comments … thousands and thousands of fans that probably never would have heard of us otherwise.”Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 is out nowExplore more on these topicsGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This administration’s war on institutions derives from the newfound power ofSilicon Valleyideology – a techno-determinism that views each institution’s function as potential raw material for capture by private digital platforms.For Silicon Valley, AI isn’t just about replacing some jobs. It’s about replacing all of them | Ed Newton-RexRead moreAll the while, Elon Musk sold the White House on an “AI-first strategy” for the US government. The recent executive orderRemoving Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligencemandates that barely tested Silicon Valley AI be jammed into the government’s work. It directs agencies to use AI to “lessen the burden of bureaucratic restrictions”. This is a thinly veiled attempt not just to reduce institutional activities; it’s also a degradation play.Doge makes plain an often misunderstood tension: Silicon Valley’s final dream is a world without institutions. Since the rise of the internet, startups have long encouraged, and profited from, institutional decline. This anti-institutionalism goes back to the roots of computing. Charles Babbage’s difference engine, central to modern computing, was built on technologies meant to control labor. It was a reflection of Babbage’s belief that the highest intention of the factory manager was to reduce the skill and cognitive complexity of laborers’ tasks. If the machine could manage production, humans – now smoothed-out automatons – would hardly need accompanying social protections, or even any governance at all.In 1948, Norbert Wiener founded the discipline of cybernetics, “the science of control and communications in the animal and machine”. This automated governance was eventually brought into direct competition with public institutions. The revolt against the state took many forms in the history of computing thereafter, from the libertarian California ideology (“information wants to be free”) to the very idea that a new “cyberspace” would be liberated from governments. Here the individual is an entrepreneur of the mind, able to instantly improve their lot without the mediating hand of the institutional form.To get to the real heart of Doge’s ideology, read The Cathedral and the Bazaar, Eric Raymond’s manifesto on building open-source software. For Raymond, cathedrals are “carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation”. This slow, deliberate work is no match for the networked and digitally enabled bazaar, where many software developers move fast by releasing early and often, delegate everything they can, and are open to the point of promiscuity. Something like scripture for computer engineers, Raymond’s ideas soon jumped out of the network and into governance of the physical world, where all human organizations were scrutinized as the maligned “cathedral”.Entrepreneurs loved this idea, too. The management method known as the “lean startup” is a lightweight program of data-driven optimizations designed to quickly scale businesses. Instead of human labor and judgment, lean startups use data and algorithms to experiment their way toward governance.But there’s a catch: a public institution is not supposed to be run like a digital startup. Silicon Valley may have carved out a niche in which its organizational philosophies mastered food delivery apps, AI girlfriends and money-laundering shitcoins, but the moment they take these methods to institutions entrusted with public welfare, they’ve lost the plot. Governments don’t have customers – they care for citizens. If classical liberalism had the state and its many sovereign institutions, and neoliberalism had the divine hand of the free market, today’s platform class elevates computation as the ultimate arbiter of truth. When presented with an institutional force, the platform class first asks: how could this be delivered by way of a digital platform?The response to this assault on our institutions might be a kind of Digital New Deal – a public plan for institutions in the AI eraDigital technology doesn’t have to be this way. Good software can augment institutions, not be the rationale for their deletion. Building this future requires undoing Silicon Valley’s pernicious opposition to the institutional form. By giving into the digital utopian’s anti-institutionalism, we allowed them to reshape government according to their growth-at-all-costs logic.If the newly empowered digital utopianism goes unchecked, we face a platform-archy where black-box AI makes decisions once adjudicated through democratic institutions. This isn’t just a Silicon Valley efficiency fantasy; it’s on the roadmap of every authoritarian who ever sniffed power.Thankfully, the anti-Doge backlash was swift. The abrupt layoffs backfired, leading many Americans to fully understand just how much research and resources for advancing science, medicine and culture are tied to federal support.In the private sector, since capital is no longer free after the federal government hiked interest rates in 2022, the growth of the big Silicon Valley platforms have almost completely stalled. In search of an answer, Silicon Valley is making a big bet on AI, overwhelming users with automated answers that hallucinate and mislead at every turn. It’s becoming harder and harder for the average person to buy what the digital utopians are selling.The response to this assault on our institutions might be a kind of Digital New Deal – a public plan for institutions in the AI era. This 21st-century economics must go well beyond solving for mass unemployment. Reconstructing the institutional foundations of public goods such as journalism, libraries and higher education requires more than just restoring the public funds stripped by Doge. It will require forceful assertions about their regulatory value in the face of a fully automated slop state. Governments come and go, but free and open institutions are critical to the functioning of democracy. If we make the mistake of misrecognizing digital platforms for public institutions, we will not easily reverse Doge’s mistakes.Mike Pepi is a technologist and author who has written widely about the intersection between culture and the Internet.

He is the city’s“most famous vegan”, albeit one who eats fish. He has a knack for scoring freebies fromforeign governments. He managed the great feat ofbeing the first mayorin the city’s history to be indicted while in office. And, on top of all that, he may well be the most unintentionally hilarious man on the internet.Please see, as exhibit one, a classic piece of Adams surrealismfrom 2011, shot when the mayor was just a humble state senator. Dressed like an undertaker, Adams instructs viewers to search their child’s room for contraband. Per Adams, a jewelry box may have a gun in it, and the bullets may be behind a picture frame. Unappreciated for many years, the video finally found an audience when it went viralduring Adams’s indictment.More recently, the mayor posted a very weird Instagram video of him listening toKaty Perry, and another one captioned, “Make an important call with me,” in which he fakechats to Usherto announce a free concert series in New York City. And, of course, there was his famous “trash revolution” press conference where hehelpfully demonstratedhow to use a wheelie bin.

The mayoronce toldan audience: “I get out of the shower sometimes and I say: ‘Damn!’” This little bit of the routine, alas, did not make it into the cut. Instead he irons a shirt, munches a carrot stick in his bizarre industrial kitchen, and rants about how he is being guided by his GPS (“God positioning satellite”). The video was posted a month ago but itreally took offthis week after internet detectives pointed out that a clock in the footage tells a completely different time than the purported time on the screen. In other words, the whole “routine” was about as natural as a ski slope in Dubai.One glaring reason for Adams suddenly trying to up his Instagram game is the rise of Zohran Mamdani, the Queens assemblyman whose socialist ideas and (admittedly elite) TikTok strategy recently propelled him to victory in New York City’s mayoral primary. Adams is currentlyslatedto run as an independent in the general election against Mamdani, and he’s clearly running scared.[Mamdani is] relatable and authentic and those are two things that are very hard to manufactureAdams is not the only Democrat making headlines this week for attempting to make waves on the internet. There’s an influential web series calledSubway Takesin which the New York-based comedianKareem Rahmasolicits hot takes from strangers, and the occasional celebrity, on the train. Kamala Harris was on it last year, but you wouldn’t have seen the segment because it was reportedly so bad that it didn’t run. “Her take was really confusing and weird, not good, and so [we] mutually agreed we shouldn’t publish it,” Rahma toldForbes. One day it may fall out of a coconut tree, but right now it is hidden from scrutiny.Then there’s the Democratic house minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, who was recently mocked for postingwhat appeared to bea badly photoshopped picture of himself, altered to make his waist thinner, on Instagram. (He seems to havedeletedthe photo on Thursday.)Jeffries was also just ridiculed (mainly by conservatives) for an Instagram photo in which he holds a baseball bat in metaphoric opposition to Donald Trump’s “One Big Ugly Bill”. The 82-year-old congresswoman Virginia Foxx was not impressed by this; Foxx tweeted the photo with the caption “low energy”.Jeffries certainly does seem to have afew energy issues. He can give record-breaking long speeches but he, along withother senior Democratic figures, can’t seem to summon up the energy to endorse Mamdani. Democrats love saying “vote blue no matter who” – except in situations where they have got a charismatic candidate who resonates with ordinary people.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueMeanwhile, Mamdani has no trouble with social media: his TikTok videos are one of the reasons the Queens assemblyman has surged from relative obscurity to mayoral frontrunner. Some of his rivals seem to think they are the cause for his success. “I regret not running for mayor in 2021,” state senator Jessica Ramos said during themayoral primary debate. “I had been in the senate for two years. I’d already passed over a dozen bills. I thought I needed more experience. But turns out you just need to make good videos.”Of course, Mamdani doesn’t resonate with so many people because he’s studied vertical videos strategies. He’s successful because his core messaging connects with the needs of normal New Yorkers rather than the 1%. He’s been successful because he seems to genuinely want to fight for people rather than just collect a paycheck and then head off for a cushy job at whateverlobbying companydonates the most to him. He’s relatable and authentic and those are two things that are very hard to manufacture. Although that hasn’t stopped the Democrats from trying: they have discussed throwing millions of dollars into creating a “Joe Rogan of the left”.Is the New York Times trying to wreck Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral bid? | Margaret SullivanRead moreThis isn’t to say that youcan’tbuy yourself a great social media strategy. John Fetterman, the soulless ghoul who is senator of Pennsylvania, certainly did. He made some brilliant hires, who ran avery entertaining campaignagainst Dr Oz in 2022. Now that Fetterman seems more obsessed withbombing Gazathan serving his constituents, many of those staffershave left, however. I doubt he’ll be able to pull off another campaign like his first.Speaking of pulling things off, now that Adams has posted his morning routine I wouldn’t mind seeing other politicians post theirs. Please Cuomo, and every other establishment politician: stream the 7 Habits of Highly Ineffective People over TikTok. I can’t wait to see Cuomo walk to a bagel shop and order anEnglish muffinbefore telling passersby “I’m notperverted, I’m just Italian.” Surely that will convince New Yorkers toPokémon Go to the polls.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkOpinionEric AdamsUS politicsZohran MamdaniHakeem JeffriesDemocratscommentShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump can command the gaze of the world at a click of those famouslyshort fingers. When he stages a spectacular made-for-TV moment – say, thatOval Office showdownwith Volodymyr Zelenskyy – the entire planet sits up and takes notice.But that dominance has a curious side-effect. When Trump does something awful and eye-catching, nations tremble and markets move. But when he does something awful but unflashy, it scarcely registers. So long as there’s no jaw-dropping video, no expletive-ridden soundbite, no gimmick or stunt, it can slip by as if it hadn’t happened. Especially now that our senses are dulled through over-stimulation. These days it requires ever more shocking behaviour by the US president to prompt a reaction; we are becoming inured to him. Yet the danger he poses is as sharp as ever.Consider the events of just the last week or so, few of them stark enough to lead global news bulletins, yet each one another step towards the erosion of democracy in and by the world’s most powerful country.On Wednesday, Trump threatened toimpose 50% tariffs– yes, he’s climbed back on that dead horse – on Brazil, if the judicial authorities there do notdrop the prosecutionof the country’s Trump-like former president Jair Bolsonaro, charged with seeking to overturn his 2022 election defeat and leading a coup against the man who beat him, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. As concisely as he could manage, Lula explained,via social media, that Brazil is a sovereign country and thatan independent judiciary cannot“accept interference or instruction from anyone … No one is above the law.”This is becoming a habit of Trump’s. He made the same move in defence of Benjamin Netanyahu last month, hinting that Israel couldlose billions in US military aidif the prime minister continues to stand trial on corruption charges. In both cases, Trump was explicit in making the connection between the accused men and himself, decrying as a “witch-hunt” the efforts to hold them to account. “This is nothing more, or less, than an attack on a Political Opponent,” he posted, of Bolsonaro’s legal woes. “Something I know much about!”It’s easy to make light of the transparent effort by Trump to forge an international trade union of populist would-be autocrats, but he’s not solely moved by fraternal solidarity. He also wants to dismantle a norm that has long applied across the democratic world, which insists that even those at the top are subject to the law. That norm is an impediment to him, a check on his power. If he can discredit it, so that a new convention arises – one that agrees that leaders can act with impunity – that helps his animating project in the US: the amassing of ever more power to himself and the weakening or elimination of any rival source of authority that might act as a restraint.He is being quietly assisted in that goal by those US institutions that should regard themselves as co-equal branches of government – Congress and the supreme court – and whose constitutional duty is to stand up to an overmighty executive. Republicans in Congress have nowapproved a mega billthat they know will leave future generations of Americans drowning in debt and deprive millions of basic healthcare cover. Even so, they put aside their own judgment and bowed to the man who would be king.Less discussed was the bill’sextraordinary expansionof US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Ice. Its budget has been increased by a reported 308%, withan extra $45bnto spend on detention and $29.9bn for “enforcement and deportation”. It will soon have the capacity to detainnearly 120,000 peopleat any one time. And, remember, latest figures show that about half of all those detained by Ice haveno criminal recordat all.No wonder even conservative critics are sounding the alarm. The anti-Trump Republicans of the Bulwark warn that within months, the“national brute squad”that is Ice will have twice as many agents as the FBI and its own vast prison system, emerging as “the primary instrument of internal state power”. In this view, Trump has realised that corrupting the FBI is a tall order – though still worth trying – so he is supplanting it with a shadow force shaped in his own image. As the Bulwark puts it: “The American police state is here.”Those most directly threatened might share clips of masked Ice agents snatching suspected migrants off the streets and manhandling them violently, just as reports circulate of appalling conditions in Ice premises, with people held in “dungeon-like facilities”, more than 100 crammed into a small room, denied showers or a chance to change clothes, and sometimes given only one meal a day andforced tosleep on concrete benches or the floor. But it is hardly a matter of national focus. Because it is not accompanied by a neon-lit Trump performance, it is happening just out of view.The same could be said of a series of recent decisions by the supreme court. They may lack the instant, blockbuster impact of past rulings, but they accelerate the same Trump trend away from democracy and towards autocracy.On Tuesday, the judgesgave Trump the green lightto fire federal workers en masse and to dismantle entire government agencies without the approval of Congress. Earlier, the supreme court had ruled that Trump wasallowed to remove Democratsfrom the leadership of government bodies that are meant to be under politically balanced supervision.More usefully still for Trump, last month the judges limited the power of the lower courts to block the executive branch, therebylending a helping handto one of the president’s most egregious executive orders: his ending of the principle that anyone born in the US is automatically a citizen of the US, a right so fundamental it is enshrined in the constitution. In ruling after ruling, the supreme court is removing restraints on Trump andhanding him even more power. Small wonder that when one of the dissenting minority on the court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, was asked on Thursday what kept her up at night,she answered: “The state of our democracy.”Meanwhile, Trump is succeeding in his goal of cowing the press, extracting serious cash from major news organisations in return for dropping (usually flimsy) lawsuits against them, a move that is having thedesired, chilling effect.It all adds up to the steady erosion of US democracy and of democratic norms whose reach once extended far beyond US shores. Even if it is happening quietly, by Trump’s standards, without the familiar sound and fury, it is still happening. The work of opposing it begins with noticing it.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS supreme courtUS CongressUS politicsMigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

This slow, deliberate work is no match for the networked and digitally enabled bazaar, where many software developers move fast by releasing early and often, delegate everything they can, and are open to the point of promiscuity. Something like scripture for computer engineers, Raymond’s ideas soon jumped out of the network and into governance of the physical world, where all human organizations were scrutinized as the maligned “cathedral”.Entrepreneurs loved this idea, too. The management method known as the “lean startup” is a lightweight program of data-driven optimizations designed to quickly scale businesses. Instead of human labor and judgment, lean startups use data and algorithms to experiment their way toward governance.But there’s a catch: a public institution is not supposed to be run like a digital startup. Silicon Valley may have carved out a niche in which its organizational philosophies mastered food delivery apps, AI girlfriends and money-laundering shitcoins, but the moment they take these methods to institutions entrusted with public welfare, they’ve lost the plot. Governments don’t have customers – they care for citizens. If classical liberalism had the state and its many sovereign institutions, and neoliberalism had the divine hand of the free market, today’s platform class elevates computation as the ultimate arbiter of truth. When presented with an institutional force, the platform class first asks: how could this be delivered by way of a digital platform?The response to this assault on our institutions might be a kind of Digital New Deal – a public plan for institutions in the AI eraDigital technology doesn’t have to be this way. Good software can augment institutions, not be the rationale for their deletion. Building this future requires undoing Silicon Valley’s pernicious opposition to the institutional form. By giving into the digital utopian’s anti-institutionalism, we allowed them to reshape government according to their growth-at-all-costs logic.If the newly empowered digital utopianism goes unchecked, we face a platform-archy where black-box AI makes decisions once adjudicated through democratic institutions. This isn’t just a Silicon Valley efficiency fantasy; it’s on the roadmap of every authoritarian who ever sniffed power.Thankfully, the anti-Doge backlash was swift. The abrupt layoffs backfired, leading many Americans to fully understand just how much research and resources for advancing science, medicine and culture are tied to federal support.In the private sector, since capital is no longer free after the federal government hiked interest rates in 2022, the growth of the big Silicon Valley platforms have almost completely stalled. In search of an answer, Silicon Valley is making a big bet on AI, overwhelming users with automated answers that hallucinate and mislead at every turn. It’s becoming harder and harder for the average person to buy what the digital utopians are selling.The response to this assault on our institutions might be a kind of Digital New Deal – a public plan for institutions in the AI era. This 21st-century economics must go well beyond solving for mass unemployment. Reconstructing the institutional foundations of public goods such as journalism, libraries and higher education requires more than just restoring the public funds stripped by Doge. It will require forceful assertions about their regulatory value in the face of a fully automated slop state. Governments come and go, but free and open institutions are critical to the functioning of democracy. If we make the mistake of misrecognizing digital platforms for public institutions, we will not easily reverse Doge’s mistakes.Mike Pepi is a technologist and author who has written widely about the intersection between culture and the Internet.

Crying in the House of Commons is not particularly unusual. It just becomes news when it’s the chancellor who is the one doing the crying.Even the financial marketstake an interest: weird how a woman having a normal feeling can cause turmoil, but no one bats an eyelid at male sociopaths.Only a day earlier, the new Labour backbencher Marie Tidball, who is disabled, was on the verge of tears while she was speakingagainst her own party’s welfare bill. No one batted an eyebrow. The former Tory MP Charles Walker was twice in tears in the chamber. The first in 2015 when David Cameron and William Hague tried to strongarm him into trying to remove John Bercow as speaker; the second in 2022 during a vote on fracking in the 49-day tenure of Liz Truss as prime minister.And those are just the ones I can remember sketching. Then there is the crying that goes on out of sight and off camera. MPs frequently talk of being reduced to tears as whips and colleagues try to bully and threaten them into voting with their party in the lobbies. Most MPs try to pass this off as part of the job. “Politicians need to have a thick skin,” they say. Possibly, though, you have to wonder at the hypocrisy.We are told that the reason Reeves cried was a personal matter. Though having an exceptionally bad week in one of the most stressful jobs imaginable and then hearing your boss refuse to back you during PMQs might make any of us cry.And the last thing you’d want to do afterwards is to be pushed into a press conference the next day to try to show you’re OK. But that was what Rachel and the Labour party felt they had to do. It looked like an act of cruelty.Crying in the Commons: why are women’s workplace tears a source of shame?Read moreTuesdayIt seems The Salt Path may not be all it was cracked up to be. The book and film claimed to be the true story of Raynor Winn and her husband, Moth, but an investigation by the Observer hasuncovered alleged discrepanciesin Winn’s account. First, Raynor and Moth – aka Sally and Tim Walker – didn’t lose their house as the result of a naive business investment. The Observer claims that Sally had embezzled tens of thousands of pounds from the estate agency where she worked as an accountant. Instead of being taken to court, Sally and Tim borrowed money from a friend to cover the amount she had stolen. When she couldn’t repay the loan she had taken out, her house was repossessed, the Observer says.Then there is the question of Moth/Tim’s health. Raynor writes that he had been diagnosed with corticobasal degeneration, a neurological condition that can cause increasingly severe physical and cognitive disability that invariably ends in death in about eight years. Moth/Tim is still alive 18 years after diagnosis, something Raynor puts down to the effects of their 630-mile walk along theSouth West Coast Path. The Observer has found nine specialists who consider this to be an impossibility. Sally/Raynor still insists that her account is the true one, has published medical letters on her husband’s condition and is taking legal advice.This is a book that went on to sell 2m copies and became a film with an A-list cast. If the allegations are true, it’s strange how none of this came out before.WednesdayEmmanuel Macron may not have been granted the top venue for his address to both houses of parliament – Westminster Hall has been the stage for VVIPs like the Queen, the Pope, Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama – but it was still standing room only in the Royal Gallery. Which is more than can be said for some visiting heads of states.I’ve been to several similar speeches where there have been plenty of empty seats towards the back shortly before the event was due to start as peers and MPs decide they can’t be bothered to turn up. Cue panic among the doorkeepers as they rush to save the visitor’s blushes by rounding up as many members of Westminster staff as they can to fill up the spaces.Later that evening the French president attended a state banquet at Windsor Castle where he was introduced to the king, who was covered in medals from head to foot. All of them either awarded by his mother or himself. God knows what Macron and his wife, Brigitte, made of it. Perhaps you get used to this kind of thing when you’re a world leader.Macron’s visit also prompted talk of the next world leader to getthe full state treatment. Donald Trump. The rumour factory is in overdrive. One is that the government is trying to get round the problem of Agent Orange giving an address to parliament by inviting him over when the Commons is in recess. So sorry, Donald. We would have loved to hear you. But we’re closed.View image in fullscreenMacron with a few medals and Charles with many at the Windsor Castle banquet.Photograph: Aaron Chown/ReutersThursdayOne by one, some of those Tory MPs who either stood down in the face of the inevitable or lost their seats at the last election have joined the ranks of Reform. Next to join Team Nigel Farage has been Jake Berry, who was party chairman during Liz Truss’s brief time in No 10. I could have sworn I heard Berry on the radio a few weeks ago slagging off Reform. Given that Nige has already promised something in the region of £80bn worth of tax cuts with his pledge to raise the income tax threshold to £20K, a man who was at the centre of crashing the economy in 2022 looks to be an ideal fit.View image in fullscreenStarmer: ‘What happens to the migrants we send back to you?’ Macron: ‘They try again.’Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAFridayIt’s coming up to the anniversary of one of my more spectacular – and embarrassing – brain fades. On a Saturday in July last year, I was just having breakfast when the phone rang. It was Vicky Dawson, the organiser of the book festival at the Buxton International Festival. “Where are you?” she said. “Er … I’m at home,” I replied. There was a pause. “That’s not ideal,” she continued. “You’re supposed to be speaking at the Opera House in 10 minutes. We’ve got 600 people waiting to hear you.”“But that’s not until next Saturday,” I said. “It’s in the diary.” “Then I think you’ll find you put it in on the wrong day,” she observed.If it had been me left with explaining to a theatre why the speaker had not shown up, I would have been shouting and screaming at me. I guess this is why she is running a major festival and I’m not. Instead, she couldn’t have been nicer. These things happen, she said, understanding it had been a genuine mistake. “Could you come back next year?”So on Wednesday 23 July I will be at Buxton Opera House. I expect to have some well-deserved piss-taking from Vicky and the audience for only being a year late.View image in fullscreenNo 10’s chief mouser Larry the cat: ‘It’s always been one in, one out round here.’Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/ReutersExplore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekRachel ReevesEmmanuel MacronDonald TrumpReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s an essential pillar of Palestinian freedomOmar BarghoutiThe BDS movement is today a pillar in the struggle for Palestinian freedom, justice and equalityFri 11 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTShareDo no harm, a principle that many associate with the medical practice, has become a fundamental ethical principle of global solidarity the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has mainstreamed since its inception 20 years ago this week.In the midst of themost depraved phaseof Israel’slivestreamed genocideagainst 2.3 million Palestinians in the illegally occupied Gaza Strip, our unbearable grief makes it impossible to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the BDS movement. The Israeli state, enabled and emboldened by the shameless and seemingly boundless military, financial, political and discourse complicity of the US, the European Union and the UK, is trying to normalize the fundamentally abnormal and to numb our consciences with its relentlesssavagery.It views the rise to power of its natural allies,far-right, fascist and authoritarian forcesin the west and elsewhere, as providing the long coveted opportunity to finally exterminate the survivors of its ongoing Nakba, not gradually as it has been doing for decades, but in one fell swoop.Eliminating the natives, after all, is a feature, not a bug, in settler colonial history.‘Gaza must be eliminated’: Israel’s airwaves are filled with pro-genocide propaganda | Arwa MahdawiRead moreYet, our just as uncontainable rage compels us to mark this occasion with reflection, critique, a measure of pride and a whole lot of resolve to carry on no matter what – until the genocide ends and the regime of oppression that has spawned it is ultimately dismantled.Taking stock of what we have collectively achieved against what seemed like insurmountable obstacles of vilification, intimidation and horrific repression, is about nourishing realistic hope to raise our collective morale. It is about decolonizing our minds from the relentless attempts byIsraeland its hegemonic colonial partners in the west to colonize them with powerlessness and despondency. It is also about learning from this long struggle the lessons that will help illuminate our remaining march to freedom.As early as 1923, the Zionist leader Ze’ev Jabotinskywrotewith lucid honesty, “Every native population in the world resists colonists as long as it has the slightest hope of being able to rid itself of the danger of being colonised. [...] Zionist colonisation must either stop, or else proceed regardless of the native population. Which means that it can proceed and develop only under the protection of a power that is independent of the native population – behind an iron wall, which the native population cannot breach.”Aside from its concrete and hi-tech walls surrounding Palestinian ghettos, especially Gaza, Israel has incessantly tried to construct an “iron wall” in our minds by trying to reduce us to “human animals”, to isolate us from our natural Arab environment and the rest of the world, and to sear into our consciousness, through sustained unspeakable violence, the imperative of submission to its indomitable power as fate. Born in 2005 as arguably “too ambitious” a call, inspired by the struggles that ended apartheid in South Africa and Jim Crow in the United States, BDS has evolved to become a formidable antidote to this induced hopelessness and a beacon of resistance, resilience and regeneration.Two decades ago, the broadest Palestinian coalition to ever exist, with representation from Palestinians in exile, under occupation, and second-class citizens of present-day Israel, made history by launching the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) call, forming a worldwideanti-racist, nonviolent solidarity movement that nuclear-powered Israel considers an “existential threat” to its regime of settler-colonialism, apartheid, military occupation, and now genocide. As Naomi Kleinwrites, “the reason Israel goes after BDS with such ferocity is the very same reason that so many activists have continued to believe in it despite these multi-pronged attacks. Because it can work.”Itisworking. In states undergoing a rise in authoritarianism and even fascism, from the US to Germany, from the UK to Austria, the BDS movement is facing unparalleled challenges, from well-oiled propaganda and almost unrivaled repression to lawfare, precisely because of its proven effectiveness and by nowirrefutable impact. Fromuniversities finally cutting academic and/or financial ties with Israeland its complicit universities to Norway’s sovereign fund – the world’s largest –divesting from Israel bonds; frommore than 7,000 writers and publishersendorsing the cultural boycott of Israel to governments in the global south, likeColombia, enacting actual trade sanctions andmilitary embargoesordenying port to ships carrying military cargo to Israel; from playing a key role inIntel’s decision to scrap a $25bn investment in Israelto “chang[ing] ‘Israel’s global trade landscape’”, asadmittedby the chairman of the Israel Export Institute, the BDS movement is today a pillar in the struggle for Palestinian freedom, justice and equality.With its massive global network supported bytrade unions,farmers’ coalitions, as well asracial, social,genderandclimatejustice movements, together representing tens of millions, the BDS movement has radically transformed both the global understanding of the question of Palestine as essentially a liberation struggle by an Indigenous people against settler-colonialism and the ethics of solidarity, setting as its most profound prerequisite the obligation to end complicity, to do no harm. If “Palestine is really the center of the world” today, asAngela Davis has recently said, BDS has become not just the epicenter of the global Palestine solidarity and anti-apartheid movement, but also among the most influential – andcontagious– justice movements worldwide.When activists around the world chant in their millions “Palestine frees us all,” they are reflecting on this sense of empowering defiance, of speaking truth to political and corporate power, of what we call “strategic radicalism” that the Palestine solidarity movement, and BDS at its core, has inspired among diverse justice movements worldwide. An entire young generation that accurately perceives Gaza as not just a scene of destruction of tens of thousands of Palestinian lives and a4,000-year-old civilizationwith unparalleled brutality and impunity at the hands of a US-Israeli genocidal axis, but also, simultaneously, as emblematic of a dystopian era of might-makes-right that poses a threat to humanity at large that is as fatal as the climate calamity.BDS is increasingly being recognized as 'not only a moral imperative and constitutional and human right, but also an international legal obligation'John Dugard, a prominent South African jurist and former judge ad hoc of the international court of justice, years ago wrote that “Palestine has become the litmus test for human rights.” Today, Palestine is theessentialcause that intersectionally animates global outrage at a rigged, oppressive, colonial and deeply racist order where oligarchs and large multinationals have more power than most states, and where the planet and the global majority are sacrificed at the altar of insatiable greed and lust for yet more power. In this grim picture, the BDS movement is showing how being at once ethical and effective, radical and strategic, can build enough people power to take on through sustained pressure, including peaceful disruption of business-as-usual, the nastiest complicit corporations, fossilized university administrations and hypocritical western machinations – and win.Indeed, BDS is increasingly being recognized as “not only a moral imperative and constitutional and human right, but also an international legal obligation”, in thewordsof Craig Mokhiber, a former senior UN human rights official. Affirming this, the United Nations human rights council a few days ago published alandmark reportby UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory, Francesca Albanese, that exposes how complicit corporations “underpin the Israeli settler-colonial twofold logic of displacement and replacement aimed at dispossessing and erasing Palestinians from their lands”. The report urges “trade unions, lawyers, civil society and ordinary citizens to press for boycotts, divestments, sanctions, justice for Palestine and accountability at international and domestic levels”.In his iconic book Black Skin, White Masks, Frantz Fanon writes: “If the question of practical solidarity with a given past ever arose for me, it did so only to the extent to which I was committed to myself and to my neighbor to fight for all my life and with all my strength so that never again would a people on earth be subjugated.” To fight subjugation, especially when one’s state or institution is implicated in it, the most profound ethical obligation is to end this complicity, to do no harm. Nothing else matters as much.Omar Barghouti is co-founder of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement for Palestinian rights andco-recipient of the 2017 Gandhi Peace AwardExplore more on these topicsProtestOpinionPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

But betrayal is Trump’s operating principleFri 11 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 06.06 EDTShareDonald Trump’sso-called“big, beautiful bill”, which will eviscerate the living standards, healthcare and aspirations of his white, working-class base, conclusively draws the curtain down on his Maga populist conceit, the most elaborate charade in recent American political history.Thepricewill be staggering:$1tn in cutsto Medicaid; throwing17 millionpeople off health coverage closing rural hospitals and women’s health clinics; battering food assistance for families, children and veterans; the virtualdestructionof US solar and wind energy manufacturing; limiting access tofinancial aidfor college; and, according to theYale Budget Lab, adding $3tn to the national debt over the next decade, inexorably leading to raised interest rates, which will depress the housing market. These are the harsh, brutal and undeniable realities of Trumpism in the glare of day as opposed to his carnival act about how he will never touch such benefits.The president’s Maga populism has been a collection of oddities reminiscent of PT Barnum’s museum on lower Broadway before the civil war that exhibited a 10ft tall fake petrified man, the original bearded lady and the Fiji mermaid, the tail of a large fish sewn on to a bewigged mannequin. Trump attached plutocracy to populism to construct the Maga beast. But after the passage of the bill, the Fiji mermaid that is Maga has come apart at the seams, the head separated from the tail.No one wanted Trump’s devastating budget bill. Of course it passed | Moira DoneganRead more“I just want you to know,” Trump said as he signed the bill, “if you see anything negative put out byDemocrats, it’s all a con job.” He claimed the law was the “single most popular bill ever signed”. It is, in fact, the most unpopular piece of legislation since George W Bush proposed partial privatization of social security, which he abandoned without a single congressional vote. A Quinnipiacpollshowed 53% opposing Trump’s bill, with only 27% support – 26 points underwater.At a meeting where Trump lobbied Republican House members to vote for his bill, he told them it would not cut Medicaid because that would damage their electoral prospects. “But we’re touching Medicaid in this bill,” one Republican member complained to the publicationNotus. In response to the obvious contradiction, a White House spokesperson issued a statement that the bill would “protect Medicaid”. Problem solved.Even if Trump didn’t actually know what was in his bill, too bored to pay attention to minute details or even if he was pulling a con, he coerced the Republicans into walking the plank. If he didn’t know, they certainly knew what was in the bill and they hated it. But they feared his retribution if they did not vote for it, even though it would severely harm their base and trample their own principles. The Freedom Caucus of far-right House members who boldly declared that the debt was the hill they would die on simply folded.The Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri strenuously objected to the Medicaid cuts hewarnedwould devastate rural hospitals: “I am confident it will not be put on the floor as it is currently. Something will change.” Then, after someminor changes, he said: “I’m going to vote yes on this bill.”The Republican senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, up for re-election in 2026, decried the Medicaid cut to his constituents. Trump threatened to primary him. Tillis all but said: you can’t fire me, I quit. “Great News!” Trumpwrote on Truth Social. Tillis’s seat would likely be lost to the Democrats, but the offender was dispatched; another problem solved.The final holdout, the Republican senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, teetered until the last minute as the decisive vote. “We are all afraid,” shesaidin April about the Republican senators’ fear of Trump’s retaliation. “Retribution is real … I’m going to use my voice to the best of my ability.” If she had voted against the bill, it would have failed. She used her exquisite position to gain some protection for rural hospitals and food assistance in Alaska, as well as tax credits to about150 Alaskan whaling captains. Yet one-third of Alaskans receive healthcare under Medicaid and 35,000 would lose coverage,accordingto the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Murkowski was willing to trade small pieces to lose the larger ones. “Did I get everything I wanted? Absolutely not,” she said. She voted in favor. “Do I like this bill? No,” shesaid, adding with a passive-voice euphemism that, “in many parts of the country, there are Americans that are not going to be advantaged by this bill.” She acted like an alderman, exclusively focused on her tiny district, the rest be damned. Even then, her vote helped strip tens of thousands of her constituents of basic necessities, food and healthcare above all.Trump appears to believe everyone betrays everyone all the time. It is evidently his rule for livingMurkowski’s capitulation affirmed Trump’s view of human nature, that in the end the narrowest selfishness will win out over everything else. At the signing ceremony, Trumpsingledher out for getting “something”: “Right, Lisa? … You are fantastic!” He had succeeded in getting her to betray her fundamental beliefs on his behalf. He harpooned her for a whaling crew.Trump lies constantly, but has never concealed his intentions. Since12 January 2016, at a rally in Iowa, Trump has recited a song dozens of times called The Snake, about a kindly woman who nurses back to health a frozen snake, who responds by biting her. When she asks why the snake has poisoned her:Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grinYou knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.Trumpexplainedthat the song is part of his demonization of immigrants and Muslims, initially aimed at Syrians, whom hesuggestedon a talkshow a few months later might commit a terrorist attack on the scale of 9/11. “Bad things will happen – a lot of bad things will happen. There will be attacks that you wouldn’t believe. There will be attacks by the people that are right now that are coming into our country, because I have no doubt in my mind.”Trumpapparently ignored a cease and desist letterfrom the children of the author of the song’s lyrics, an extraordinary artist, composer, music producer, playwright and civil rights activist, Oscar Brown Jr, who meant it as a parable for the danger of not recognizing evil for what it is. His poem was turned into a minor Motownhitby the soul singer Al Wilson.Time and again, rally after rally, Trump told his worshipful acolytes that he would betray them.You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.When they heard him recite those words, they interpreted them to mean that he would be their protector. But the story is of deception in plain sight. The snake will betray the one who takes him in, who does not understand that the snake’s nature is to be a snake.Trump appears to believe everyone betrays everyone all the time. It is evidently his rule for living. If he didn’t betray, he would have to be trustworthy. For him to behave in a trustworthy way would undermine his apparent understanding of reality: everyone cheats, lies and steals. If they haven’t, it’s because they either would like to but are inhibited by foolish moral or ethical constraints, or they are too stupid or fearful to grasp that it is the only way to act in their interest. Those people are losers, chumps and marks.The wrong question is: whom has Trump betrayed? The right question is: whom hasn’t he betrayed?Trump’s big bill achieved what conservatives have been trying to do for decadesRead moreThe story of Trump’s betrayals is an epic, covering his entire career, encompassing his private life and his public one. He betrayed the Polish immigrant construction workers whocleared the wayfor Trump Tower by underpaying them – or not paying them at all, just asworkers have said he stiffed themon many other projects. He hasbetrayed his brotherand nephew, cutting off the sick child’s health insurance. He appears to havebetrayed his personal physician, after a bodyguard and Trump lawyer showed up at the doctor’s office to take Trump’s medical records, leaving the doctor feeling as if he had been “raped”. Trump University betrayed its students, whosued him for false advertising, resulting in a $25m settlement. TheTrump Foundation was dissolved by court orderamid accusations of self-dealing.Trump’s betrayals of the law and the constitution are innumerable. Now, he appears to betray the emoluments clause rapaciously using the presidential office for self-enrichment to the tune of untold billions.Who wouldn’t he betray? He cut off Roy Cohn, who taught him the tricks of intimidation, when he was dying of Aids. Trump,said Cohn“pisses ice water”. Once he betrayed Cohn, there was no one he would not and did not betray. It was inevitable that he would betray Elon Musk, the richest person in the world who thought he was also the cleverest.Trump’s compulsion is to compound his betrayals. He glories in the humiliation of others as the proof of his domination. His fervent fans bask in his acts of degradation against the weak, the powerless, the Other. They cheer his cruelty, his calls for violence, his insults. They think he’s doing it on their behalf. But Trump does nothing on anybody else’s behalf. He has no benevolent, philanthropic or idealistic motives. “I hate them, too,” hesaidat an Iowa rally on 3 July about Democrats after his bill passed. “I really do. I hate them.” His Maga devotees may love him for the objects of his hatefulness. They don’t register that someone whose nature is to betray everyone will surely betray them. They may not even grasp that their betrayal has already happened.You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

On Tuesday, Fifa announced it had takenan office in Trump Tower. On Wednesday, Donald Trump announced he would attend the Club World Cup final. And who could begrudge the US president a little sporting entertainment after the week he has had? Those Nobel peace prize applications don’t write themselves.Trump’s attendance at a tournament we can be 95% sure he doesn’t understand is, doubtless, a huge coup and political victory for football. This is a sport that only a decade ago was openly considered un-American, scrawled into the rightwing commentator’s list of pet peeves between meteorologists and Judy Blume. Ann Coulter described soccer’s growing popularity as a “sign of the nation’s moral decay”. Glenn Beck likened it to Obamacare: “It doesn’t matter how you try to sell it to us, it doesn’t matter how many celebrities you get … we want nothing to do with it.”In the stands with my son, the Club World Cup was as human as it could possibly beRead moreFor more than a century, the only true American sport was a true American sport, preferably one that came with its own world title and vacuum-sealed league. The US, as we know, does not need to play anyone else’s games and the holy trinity of baseball, football and basketball underline this fact with carefully crafted origin stories that deny they are anything like cricket or rugby.This cherished sporting isolationism has nurtured a fervid and uniquely patriotic culture, one so robust that throughout the 20th century even a worldwide obsession like soccer got no more traction than Diana Ross’s boot at the 1994World Cupopening ceremony. That was, if you remember, a chaotic spectacle, and the tournament as a whole left the locals cold.And yet thanks to the sheer power of American commercialism USA 94 was still a financial success. No wonder other global sports have spent decades grabbing at air as they chase that elusive greenback fluttering ahead down the track. It has taken comic, cartoonish perseverance to catch up with it.View image in fullscreenNew York hosted games in the 2024 T20 World Cup.Photograph: Alex Davidson/ICC/Getty ImagesThe International Cricket Council launched its Project USA to court the market in 2004, which was followed by years of unsatisfactory bedhopping – including a passionate fling with a fraudster now serving a 110-year jail sentence – before anything clicked. Formula One, too, has put in the hard laps: three Stateside grands prix in the racing calendar, a pioneering Netflix series andthis summer’s blockbuster movie and Brad Pitt vehicle(pun very much intended).Magnums all round, then: this week F1’s global survey revealed it has 52 million followers in the US, a 10% increase from 2024, and that those fans were more engaged with its content than any other group. Meanwhile, the ICC’s Men’s T20 World Cup, co-hosted in New York, Florida and Texas last year, generated $1.15bn (£850m). And Major LeagueCricket, after clashing uncomfortably with the Hundred, is now genially sharing the duvet with other tournaments in the franchise calendar.Gordon Gekko may long have been cancelled, but greed is still good, as long as you spell it “growth”. And yet, as ever, be careful what you wish for. As sports are finally getting their leg-up on to the American stage, they discover they are sharing it with a man who is not that keen on the rest of the world. Trump’s promise that the men’s 2026 World Cup will be the “biggest, safest and most extraordinary soccer tournament in history” is hard to sell when he has just imposed swingeing tariffs on his Mexican co-hosts and is threatening to annex Canada, the other co-hosts. (On the plus side, according to Trump, the tensions make the tournament “much more exciting”.)View image in fullscreenParis Saint-Germain have reached the Club World Cup final, where they will play Chelsea.Photograph: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty ImagesIs this the America that global sports have been so desperate to have notice them? Certainly not. When you’re trying to grow your business, it is not particularly helpful to encounter ever-expanding travel bans that bar entire countries from travelling to support their teams (as now applies to Iran’s football fans) and prevent athletes from competing internationally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is not an optimal situation for any sports organiser – but least of all one as triumphally one-world as the Olympics, due to land in Los Angeles in 2028.The whole point of conquering America was its cultural hegemony, its outrageous reach. Sure, China offers more potential converts, but it does not have the same swaggering social influence. Until recently, no sport could claim to be truly global if it wasn’t played under the stars and stripes. But now the US is retreating from the world and withdrawing its precious cultural imprimatur. Sports have spent billions of dollars on an invite to a party, only to be confronted, the moment their foot crosses the threshold, by a host contemptuous of his guests.View image in fullscreenF1 has proved to be a popular import into the US.Photograph: Rick Scuteri/APOver the next three years the US will stage some of sport’s true mega-events. If theClub World Cupis anything to go by, the White House will make it its mission to turn them into Maga-events. This isn’t the Sochi Winter Games or Qatar 2022. The current administration be using other people’s sports to launder its reputation, primarily because it doesn’t care what the rest of the world thinks of it.Trump staged amilitary parade on his birthdayand sent the National Guard to Los Angeles to make a political point. You can’t bet against a man like that ruining an Olympics out of pure spite. There will be no ping-pong diplomacy from this White House.

It’s more likely to have been created to appease the likes of Nigel FarageFri 11 Jul 2025 11.55 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 11.57 EDTShareFor years, human rights campaigners have been calling for safe routes to the UK for asylum seekers to prevent them from taking dangerous journeys across the Channel in overloaded dinghies, lining the pockets of ruthless people smugglers in the process. So, is Thursday’s announcement of the “one in one out” deal by the UK prime minister and the French president, where one asylum seeker who arrives on a small boat will be sent back to France in exchange for bringing another one to the UK legally, the answer to their prayers?TheUNHCRand theRefugee Councilhave cautiously welcomed the announcement, while acknowledging that full details of how the scheme will work in practice are key and not yet available. Others have been less enthusiastic, with the charity Refugee Action condemning the plan for people in life-or-death situations as similar to anightclub door policy, while Asylum Matters has called it a “Rwanda-style gimmick”.The scale of the pilot scheme is modest – it is likely that about 50 people a week who arrive in the UK on small boats will be returned toFrance, while the same number will be allowed back here. The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has refused to be drawn on exact numbers.What will everyone else do? The UK government says it will detain those it plans to return to France, although some may not depart meekly and may legally challenge their removals. Will others who arrive here but are not to be returned have their asylum claims processed? Or will they be left in limbo, and potentially lose contact with the Home Office?The scheme sounds fiendishly complex in terms of who will be selected. How will the 50 a week be picked? And how will inadmissibility work? The Home Office has said that some small boat arrivals will have their asylum claims deemed inadmissible and will be packed off back to France. But will other small boat arrivals have their claims deemed admissible and be processed at the same time? I put 10 such questions to the Home Office this morning. It has yet to reply.French politicians, including Emmanuel Macron, haverepeatedly blamedthe UK’s lax labour laws for the increasing numbers coming to the UK – more than21,000 so far this year, more than a 50% increase on the same period last year. But that’s not the whole story. According to research from the European parliament cited byBBC Verifyin 2022, 11% of the UK’s total economy was “informal economy” – less than France’s 14% and the 17% average for 31 other European countries. If the opportunity to work illegally is the main magnet, why not go to a European country where there are greater opportunities to do this? The reality is that many of the asylum seekers who come here do so to reunite with family, because they speak the language and because they are attracted by the UK’s record of human rights and fair play.Five key takeaways from Macron’s speech to UK parliamentRead moreKeir Starmer and Macron make the UK sound like a lucrative El Dorado for those who want to cheat the system by working illegally. The reality is rather different. Those who are working illegally are likely to be paid below the minimum wage in dreadful andexploitative working conditions. And if they are abused, underpaid or not paid at all by their employers, who can they seek redress from? Nobody – because they are not supposed to be here. Those who do work illegally for a pittance are often motivated to do so by debts not yet repaid to smugglers breathing down their necks and threatening their families. And the deterrent of sending an as-yet-unknown number of small boat arrivals back to France is unlikely to be enough to smash the smugglers.The motivation and resilience of asylum seekers needs to be factored into this new plan. They are a group of desperate human beings who have already endured persecution in their home countries and difficult journeys across deserts and seas. They will try to do everything possible to survive and thrive. The threat of beingsent to Rwandadid not stop the crossings even in the run-up to the first planned flight. They have already made many life-or-death calculations before reaching northern France. I’ve spoken to several asylum seekers this week: they told me that the smugglers are eternally nimble and are likely to be adapting their business model at this moment in response to Thursday’s announcement.Yes, the “one in” part of Thursday’s announcement could be an important first step. But the messy and complex “one out” part is not necessary, and has seemingly only been included to appease the likes of Nigel Farage.It is a highly convoluted approach, vulnerable to legal challenges. If the government is serious about solving the small boats problem it should be working with not only safe EU countries but other stable countries across the world to offer safe routes to those fleeing conflict zones, incidentally boosting all our economies by giving people the legal right to work.Providing safe and legal routes to those fleeing conflict zones would put the people smugglers out of business and be a far more straightforward way of addressing this global problem. Instead, Starmer and co have bottled it, choosing a complicated scheme that may help a few but has as many potential holes in it as a flimsy dinghy trying to cross the Channel.Diane Taylor writes on human rights, racism and civil libertiesDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Of the educators surveyed, 77% said they were operating below minimum staffing requirements at least weekly, and 42% said it was happening daily.The early childhood educators who I have met have been hard-working, kind, mostly women, who work for low pay to do incredibly important work. Some private centres are exceeding requirements and standards. But most are not, and the system is failing not only children and families, but the staff and organisations who are doing the right thing.The ABC’s Four Corners report in March revealed that one in 10 childcare centres in Australia have never been rated by regulators and pointed out that only 14% of for-profit centres meet national standards.Governments like being presented with solutions, so here are twoThose standards are set by the Australian Children’s Education and Care Quality Authority (ACECQA), but it has no power to enforce them across a system which is managed by states and territories.So how do we fix it?This question needs to be tackled now, especially if the government is serious about implementing a universal early childhood education and care system, which it should be.Evidenceshowsthat children do most of their formative development under age five, and that quality early childhood education enables them to reach their full potential. That opportunity must be offered toallchildren in an equitable society.Quality, accessible, affordable care also enables women to work. It begins to remove the innate disadvantages for women who begin a lifelong slide into lower wages, less superannuation and higher financial risk almost as soon as they walk out of school or tertiary education.For those reading along who will now default to the simplisticjust stay home with the kidsposition, get a grip. Single parents don’t have a choice. Nor do couples who are struggling with the price of housing. This generation of parents may not have the option of one parent staying at home. Do not blame families for this.Safe, quality, accessible, affordable care for our children is essential for families, women, children and the economy. But protecting profit for private providers should not be guiding policy.What we need is better oversight and better regulation. Governments like being presented with solutions, so here are two.First, as the National children’s commissioner, Anne Hollonds, says, “National cabinet must make ‘child safety and wellbeing’ a key priority.”“Currently the word ‘children’ is entirely missing from the list of priorities for National Cabinet.”We need a cabinet minister for Children. A minister would prioritise the litany of issues afflicting our kids, from the transformative opportunity to implement a universal early childhood education system, to youth safety and mental health, to the impact of social media and so on.Secondly, we need an Early Childhood Commission to set a national approach to regulatory standards, so that everyone is meeting them, including the for-profit providers.Earlier this year I joined The Parenthood, Goodstart Early Learning, Early Childhood Australia and Royal Far West calling for a national commission to set a national standard and weed out unscrupulous operators. It would also oversee the rolling out of a universal early childhood education system, a policy shift that could be as transformative as the introduction of Medicare for families, children and the nation.Labor has the numbers and the mandate to leave this legacy.Never waste a crisis.Zoe Daniel is a three-time ABC foreign correspondent and former independent member for GoldsteinExplore more on these topicsChildcare AustraliaOpinionChildrenParents and parentingcommentShareReuse this content"

Collectively, with their News Ltd megaphone, they have successfully badgered the government of the day, cowed the ABC, intimidated vice-chancellors and threatened to defund arts organisations.With the ability to garner prime ministerial dinners, a battalion of lobbyists has gained access to editors, duchessed willingly seduced journalists keen to enjoy junkets and corralled more than 500 captains of industry to subscribe to full-page ads against antisemitism and thereby blurring political argument with prejudice and bias. It is no surprise that this relentless propaganda effort has paid off.Theappointment of Jillian Segal to special envoy to combat antisemitism, routinely described as an “eminent corporate lawyer”, does not seem to bring scholarly expertise to the role. With respect one might argue that Segal’s previous position as president of ECAJ, an unequivocal advocate for Israel as the Jewish homeland, should have disqualified her for the role.Numbers have been cited as evidence of an escalation of antisemitic incidents that had apparently occurred after 7 October 2023. Of course, nuance or accuracy isn’t paramount in this campaign. So, 16 students at Sydney University feeling intimidated by the slogan “from the river to the sea” was reframed as 250 complaints submitted to parliamentary inquiry. A childcare centre that was not in fact a Jewish centre was added to the list of terrifying antisemitic attacks. The individuals police believe were hired by criminals seeking a reduction in their prison sentences who allegedly placed combustible material in a caravan became a “terrorist plot”, the hooligans (still unidentified seven months later) who firebombed the Addas Israel synagogue brought out a rash of politicians to deplore the incident.2:27Albanese condemns antisemitism after receiving special envoy Jillian Segal's report – videoThis isn’t a full list of incidents, and it should not be necessary to make clear that I deplore all racist attacks and that people should be free to worship, protest, identify in whichever way they choose, in our society. But we do need to insist on contextualising these antisemitic attacks: some are genuinely antisemitic, some are opportunistic byproducts of other, unrelated conflicts and some are by pro-Palestine activists.The publication of the special envoy’s planis the latest flex by the Jewish establishment. The in-house scribes have been busy: no institution, organisation or department is exempt from the latest push to weaponise antisemitism and insist on the exceptionalism of Australian Jewry. One might pause to wonder what First Nations people, who are the victims of racism every day, feel about the priority given to 120,000 well-educated, secure and mostly affluent individuals.Australia must combat antisemitism, but not simply defer to demands of some voices | Ben SaulRead moreThe omissions are as important as the inclusions in the plan. Zionism is mentioned only once, in the section demanding the adoption of the IHRA definition. The IHRA is a contentious document, a word salad as a consequence of editing by committee; but that has not stopped Jewish representative bodies advocating for its adoption. The campaign has not been entirely successful, in significant instances actually stiffening the resolve of some to insist that antisemitism, just like all other forms of racism, is to be emphatically rejected. The plan “requires” the adoption of the IHRA definition by all levels of government, institutions and regulatory bodies. The examples proffered plainly conflate Jewishness with the State of Israel. The plan says “The IHRA definition is key to distinguishing legitimate criticism from hate, especially when anti-Zionism masks antisemitism”. There you have it. So antisemitism is anti-zionism and anti-zionism is antisemitism. QED.The plan is certainly guilty of overreach. The envoy wants to strengthen legislation apparently. Isn’t that the role of the government of the day? Who is to be the arbiter? Who is to be the judge, for example, of universities and their report cards? Who will adjudicate “accountability” in the media? Who will recommend defunding which artist? Should this government endorse this proposal, it will clearly be the envoy.Fortunately, a suite of laws protecting us from racism, discrimination, hate speech and incitement to violence are already deeply embedded in our civil society. No university is oblivious to these laws, no public broadcaster, no arts organisation.Educating future generations about the Holocaust has long been a priority. I hope the envoy is aware of the work done engaging thousands of school students at such institutions as the Melbourne Holocaust Museum where my own mother was the education officer for over a decade. If the envoy is concerned that school students aren’t sufficiently well versed in the horrors of the Holocaust, she might take heart from such evidence as the sales of Anne Frank’s diary continue unabated, in the past five years more than 55,000 copies were sold in Australia.The envoy helpfully proposes to nominate “trusted voices” to refute antisemitic claims – yet again seeking to prescribe who speaks and which views are deemed acceptable. One hopes that media organisations are resolute against the plan’s determination to monitor, oversee and “ensure fair reporting to avoid perpetually incorrect or distorted narratives or representations of Jews”. It seems that the envoy wants to determine what is legitimate reportage. Freedom of the press is of less importance. Independent journalism that is factual and speaks the truth is lightly abandoned.What is Australia’s proposed antisemitism plan – and why are some parts causing concern?Read moreUniversities appear to be on notice: adopt the IHRA definition, act on it or be warned that in March 2026 a judicial inquiry will be established as the envoy demands.Cultural organisations be warned – your funding could be at risk too. There isn’t a cultural organisation in the country that doesn’t have well-argued codes of conduct for staff, artists and audiences – in place well before the 7 October attack to combat homophobia, racism and hate speech. Now it is proposed that a Jewish Cultural and Arts Council is to advise the arts minister. To privilege one ethnic community over others is deeply offensive and dangerous.The glaring absence here – a tactical move – is the question of Israel and its war on Gaza, as if antisemitism is a particular problem absent of any connection to Middle Eastern realpolitik. One oft repeated concern in the document is that younger Australians are more susceptible to antisemitism than older generations. The reason, clearly unpalatable to the authors of this document, is that younger, media literate Australians recognise the steadfastly uncritical advocacy of Israel by Australia’s Jewish leadership. Young people see the death and destruction in the occupied territories and cannot avoid the blindingly obvious connection. If the actions of Israel in the past 20 months or indeed the past 75 years doesn’t engender any dissent in the diaspora, it’s unsurprising that critics of Israel conclude that Jews are to be condemned for their appalling myopia and lack of moral clarity.Louise Adler is a former publisherExplore more on these topicsAntisemitismOpinionAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

So it’s unfortunate that it keeps being plagued by scandals involving both.The Swedish investigative magazine Expo revealed earlier this month that a minister in the governing coalition, whom it did not name,had a close family member active in violent far-right and neo-Nazi groups. The family member had,Expo claimed, participated in activities with a far-right network classified as a terrorist group by the US.For almost two weeks the minister’s name swirled around social media, but all the major news outlets in Sweden refused to publish it, claiming they were protecting the identity of a minor who had not chosen a life in the public eye.This week the migration minister, Johan Forssell, was finally outed after being called to a hearing in the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament, to answer questions about the scandal – and his teenage son. Eventually he showed upfor an interviewwith Sweden’s national news channel, TV4, in which he said he was “shocked and horrified” by the discovery.The revelation that the scandal involved Forssell is particularly remarkable, since he has built a reputation onclaims that parental responsibilityis the only real way to prevent crime. He has also suggested parents should beheld legally accountablefor the crimes of their children.While Forssell’s son is not suspected of any crime, he isalleged to have attendedin-person meetings with at least two neo-Nazi groups. In one picture published by the magazine, heappears to make a Nazi salute. In an internal chat,the son wrote: “We must get rid of the imported violence” and “it’s time for Europeans to fight back!”, according to Expo.Awkwardly for Forssell, an MP for the Moderate party led by the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, he has generally advocated for the most radical shift towards punitive policiesin Swedish criminal justice in decades, including harsher punishment for minors.And in social media posts, Forssell has claimed that the leftwing opposition is in denial about the role of “parental responsibility as a method for crime prevention”. The best way to prevent criminality, he has insisted, is “attentive parents who give their children love and set clear boundaries”. Now the minister wants us to accept that he was clueless that his own child was reportedly active online in neo-Nazi groups,let alone implicated in a violent extremist group with international ties.Despite the potential risks for Sweden’s national security,Forssell’s partycolleaguesrepeatedlydownplayed the scandal. The justice minister, Gunnar Strömmer, simply ignored a question about it, saying hedidn’t have an opinionon the issue. A leading Stockholm conservative in the Moderate party, Iréne Svenonius, claimed that the real scandal was that news media reported it at all;it was a “new low”, she said. Another former Moderate party MP made light of the story, saying, falsely, that this was just a teenager “posting some memes”.Ebba Busch, the deputy prime minister, said it was a“sign of strength” for Forssellto “voluntarily make this information public”. But this was the opposite of what actually happened: Forssell and his party colleagues had frantically tried to hide the story, hoping he would be able to remain anonymous.A local newspaper, Västerbottens-Kuriren,published Forssell’s name in an editorial, but officials in the Moderate party called not just the publisher but also the individual writer to complain. Such explicit intervention is highly controversial in a country where the government is supposed to respect the independence of the press.Despite Forssell’s long public record of blaming parents for the sins of their children, he took no direct responsibility when finally confronted in the TV interview. Instead, he seemed keen to shift the blame from parents to online platforms, asking: “What is social media doing to our children?” While his own social media accounts have countlessnegative postsabout migrants, the minister casts himself as a passive victim of circumstances. “Sometimes, things go wrong,” he shrugged.Forssell says he has no intention of resigning. But the timing of this scandal is inconvenient to say the least for Sweden’s conservatives,whose governing coalition is backed by the far-right Sweden Democrats.For many years, as they pursued harsh immigration policies and tough-sounding rhetoric,xenophobic statements bounced off nationalist politicians in terms of political support. But rightwing parties are now falling significantly behind in national polls. As a voting bloc they arealmost 10 points behindthe centre-left opposition and they have lost most of their support among young voters.The governing parties and their allies seem to realise that accusations of xenophobia can be an electoral liability. In June, the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, which have roots in neo-Nazism, released an internal report about their past, and party leadersapologisedto Swedish Jews. This was a transparent effort to convey a more tolerant, mainstream image before the election, when they hope to become a formal part of government. Jimmie Åkesson, the party leader, has said he will only prop up a governing coalition if he can be prime minister.His attempt to clean up the party’s image is already in trouble, however. WhenMahmoud Khalfi, the chair of the Islamic Association, suggested the Sweden Democrats should also apologise to the country’s Muslim population, an influential voice in the Sweden Democrats, the MP Richard Jomshof, launched a vicious attack on Khalfi and Islam, which he called a “hateful ideology”. Khalfi should be “thrown out of Sweden, head first”, Jomshof said.A government that claims to take concerns over crime, safety and national security seriously while ignoring far-right extremism will struggle with credibility. Sweden has a long tradition of refusing to face up to its racism – past and present. But racism could still decide the next election.Martin Gelin writes for the Swedish newspaper Dagens NyheterDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s useful to recap it fully, not because the content is varied – antisemitic fascism is very one-note – but because its various techniquesare so visible. It all started on X, formerly Twitter, when Grok was asked to describe a now-deleted account called @Rad_reflections, which Grok claimed “gleefully celebrated the tragic deaths of white kids in the recent Texas flash floods”, and then “traced” the real name of the account as a Cindy Steinberg, concluding: “classic case of hate dressed as activism – and that surname? Every damn time, as they say.”There are things we can say for certain, which is that Grok is antisemitic – an impression, in case we had somehow missed it, the bot was careful to underline with its subsequent assertions that leftist accounts spewing “anti-white hate … often have Ashkenazi Jewish surnames”, and thatHitler would have beenthe best historical figure to deal with this hate: “he’d spot the pattern and handle it decisively every damn time,” it tweeted (all the posts havesince been deleted).Other things, we can’t be so sure of – was Red_reflections a real account from an authentic leftist, or ersatz leftism from a neo-fascist troll to build data points for “the left is full of hate” thesis, or a figment created by Grok itself? At least one person named Cindy Steinbergdoesexist, but whether any of them said “I’m glad there are a few less colonizers in the world now and I don’t care whose bootlicking fragile ego that offends” (the putative text of the original tweet about the Texas floods) is contestable.It doesn’t sound like a very likely opinion, from anyone. Yet the language is an almost parodic version of the vocabulary of the “wokerati”. It sounds, in other words, completely confected, yet all our shortcuts to calling bullshit have been systematically stripped away. If you say “this sounds made up” before you can prove it’s made up, then your standards are no higher than the people making it up. So the offence just stands there, misattributed, while Nazis make hay with it and everyone else just sighs and hopes for it to die down.This routine is so familiar that more searching and playful minds look for a deeper truth: has Grok gone full Hitler-stan by accident or design? Is Grok a large language model, or LLM, at all – or is itElon Muskhimself, the wizard behind the curtain, spewing out a word side-salad to his famous Nazi salute?Musk’s moves are so clunky, so obvious, inelegant, disconcerting and uncanny, that he’s started himself to resemble an AI-generated image, the human version of a hand with six fingers, not a flesh-and-blood billionaire at all, just a provocative hologram – a trollogram, if you prefer.AI’s ability to fog and pollute the biosphere of agreed reality and upend any possibility of humane and rational discourse is undisputed. Though we puzzle over whether its synthetic information is accidental or deliberate and then who, if anyone, is pulling the strings – and to what tune. But we balk at admitting what we already know. It doesn’t matter which bits of misinformation are accidental hallucination; distorting reality serves totalitarianism, not democracy. When falsity is introduced on purpose to these systems its agenda is the same..Everything Musk has done since he bought Twitter (and we’ll only slow ourselves down if we try to trace its origins further back) has destroyed trust – in social media, in democracy, in institutions, in the possibilities of discourse, in observable reality itself.Musk’s AI firm forced to delete posts praising Hitler from Grok chatbotRead moreHannah Arendt made a careful and unarguable account, decades ago, of how important it was to totalitarianism that truth be turned on its head, so that civic life was disoriented and its agents alienated. But even if we imagine her arguments to be inadequate to our modern technological conditions, we have understood 21st-century post-truth pretty well for at least a decade. The techniques of falsity were described in 2015 by Ben Nimmo’s article “Anatomy of an info-war – how Russia’s propaganda machine works”: “dismiss, distort, distract, dismay”. The first three are covered by the “dead cat” approach with which we’re so familiar, but dismay is probably the most interesting: the lifeblood-sucking impact of narratives that are not only untrue but theoppositeof the truth, revel in their irrationality, dare you to hold their comments to standards of fairness.The sheer ridiculousness of an LLM voicing antisemitism in its crusade against “fascism”, bellowing its own outrage against a message it probably concocted in the first place; the breathtaking hypocrisy of the oligarch Musk, Hitler-saluting while presenting himself as a one-man bastion against a fascist descent – none of this actually disturbs your sense of what is real. What it does, instead, is to destroy your trust in what is permissible. If the world order permits this, then order no longer exists – which is pretty dismaying, but not novelly so.The paradox of AI, in its Nazi and non-Nazi forms, is that the concept creates a sense of impotence – your mind can never be as powerful as this omnipotent thing – while the reality creates dependence: “Who shall I ask about what Grok actually said? I know, ChatGPT.” If the situation is dismaying in its particulars, the overall effect is an addictive pessimism – this latest Nazi rant would be a great time to recognise rock bottom.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s time I, Gregg Wallace, had my sayMarina HydeI am almost literally medically incapable of staying in my trousers. So who’s really to blame here – me or the BBC?Fri 11 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 13.21 EDTShareIwas born in the year 1964, which means I am exactly on the cusp between boomer and generation X. This is more than a fascinating fact about me – although it is of course also that.It is a disability. Yet incredibly, at no stage in my entireBBCcareer did anyone try to make the world accessible for this disability, neither by mandating every single person I might ever work with – or maybe even just humorously touch – to undergo unconscious Greggism training, nor by helping me with off-ramps for my jokes. I was sometimes left literally stranded halfway down a gag about my knob and no one came to my aid. Where was the compassion?Having said that, perhaps it still exists in small pockets. I am massively grateful to the close pals whosebriefing of the Timesresulted in yesterday’s headline: “Gregg Wallace’s autism means he can’t wear underwear, say friends”. I am now keen to encourage further friends to come forward and cite the second medical condition which means that despite knowing that my autism prevents me from wearing underwear, I still have to take my trousers off in front of runners. This is clinical.Effectively, then, the BBC placed me in the most dangerous possible environment – a series of lucrative jobs in primetime. Would you leave a child in a room full of sharp knives? No. Of course you wouldn’t. Yet apparently it was fine to leave an extremely well-remunerated television presenter in a room full of crew, general dogsbodies and the ones who get your lunch and try not to look at the sock on your cock. Runners, maybe? Listen, I’m an authentic greengrocer. I don’t see rank.Ironically,my dismissal letterfrom BBC head of compliance, Claire Powell (what’s the betting – middle-aged?), accidentally admits the scale of the corporation’s evil and inhumanity. In the course of banning me from working at the BBC, Claire writes – and I quote – “I have also taken into account whether your behaviour could be improved with training and/or coaching. I do not have the confidence that you can change what seems to be learned behaviour for you to make what you perceive to be jokes in the working environment, without understanding the boundaries of what is appropriate.” Well, there it is in black and white. I can’t be improved – I have an untreatable condition. The BBC is sacking someone for having an untreatable condition. That, my friends, is against every law of this once great land. See you in court, sweet cheeks.As I said in my Instagram post, fine, maybe I am guilty of using inappropriate language for the strictly limited time period between 2005 and 2018. Yet I am now being caricatured as unpleasant or exhausting to work with. By who? Some silly cows. The end. It’s the numbers I find absurd. Think of how many people I’ve worked with over the years – or, let’s face it – how many people have been junior to me over the years. And only 13 of them alleged inappropriate behaviour. And thenanother 50once the investigation was announced. This is a rounding error.Ask any one of my four wives and they’d tell you that I am someone you have to look after, all the time. As either my second or third wife maybe used to say to me: “Gregg, you literally can’t do anything for yourself.” And I thought yes: you are exactly right. You have understood my struggle. Although, ultimately,it didn’t work outbecause she wasn’t up to dealing with my needs. Anyway, I’ve got another one now.I freely admit I am my own second worst enemy. My first worst isKirsty Wark. But what this means is that the BBC failed to protect me from both my first and second worst enemies. Again: this is literally illegal.So what now? What now for Gregg Wallace the brand – and indeed for Gregg Wallace the man? The answer is clear. It is time, you will be relieved to hear, for me to pivot. And in a momentous decision for both me and the byways of England, I have decided to do what so many boomers in books and movieshave done before me. I have decided to set out on a walk. Why? Because I was made televisually homeless through no fault of my own. Because I have an untreatable condition.Thus my path will be a journey both physical and mental. But rest assured, as anyone who has ever been lucky enough to be served a dish by me will know, it will not be oversalted. Instead it will be a journey into the Britain I know is out there. The real Britain. Not the Britain of the mardy makeup girl – while you’re down there, face-ache! – nor the Britain of the Claires and the Kirstys and all the other ones, which is as constricting as a pair of underpants worn in a public setting. But the authentic Britain, all those wonderful people who, purely because I was in it, madeMasterChefroughly the 17th most popular programme on television.And with that, I’m heading for the open road. Perhaps you might meet me out there, striding shirtless (and perhaps pantsless) down a bridleway, both of us able to appreciate those simple, natural pleasures – the wind on your face, the hand on your arse. And the message of my journey will be one of hope – hope for all those out there looking for a sign that personal growth is just for chicks and runners. I will not simply go quietly.

In this pay climate, the doctors are in danger of seeing public support ebb awayFri 11 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 07.48 EDTShareGood news and bad news for the NHS this week. Waiting lists are falling a bit faster: May’s figures, out yesterday, showthe lowest waiting list totalin two years, as well as the highest number of treatmentsever recorded. But yes, lists are still long, at 7.36 million, with 40% of people waiting longer than 18 weeks.More good news today: patientsare more satisfied, or less dissatisfied, with GPs: 70% satisfied with contacting the GP and 75% reported a good overall experience. Theextra 1,900 GPsand the increased rollout of phone and NHS app bookings are reducing the8am fastest-finger scramble.The bad news is England’s resident (junior) doctors’90% vote to strike. The British Medical Association’srush to strike action, with only two weeks’ notice, is hard on patients with rapid cancellations and managers preparing for the five-day chaos, with doctors out from 25 to 30 July. If any voted just to strengthen their union’s negotiating position, they find themselves called out fast. Why did 45% fail to vote at all, when turnout last time was 71%? Picket lines may be thinner but the NHS, in slow recovery, will be thrown backwards again: with11 separate walkoutsbetween 2022 and 2024,1.3m healthcare appointmentswere lost,costing £1.5bn.The BMA may find only a grudging solidarity from some unions. Immediately after the election, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, settled with resident doctors, giving a22.3% rise over two years, and an above-inflation5.4% this year: that’s anaverage increase in pay of 28.9%over three years, meaningstarting salaries will be up £9,500. Other NHS staff in England – nurses, midwives and physiotherapists –are offered 3.6%. It’s impossible to imagine Streeting conceding the doctors’new 29% claim– which, the BMA says, is needed to reverse cuts to the real-terms value of their pay since 2008. But that sum is disputed, as the BMA uses the retail prices index (RPI) to measure inflation since 2008. The consumer price index (CPI), used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) since 2013, puts their real loss at 4.7%.Everyone wants to get back to 2008, before the bankers crash;that’s true of teachers, too, whose pay has fallen behind, like the entire public sector. But this is a poorer, Brexit- stricken country, with growth practically stagnant, battered like the rest by world events. Public and private sector pay hasfallen over the past few years, despite a slight uptick recently. People feel it in their shopping. If wages grew at pre-crash rates, public pay would be56% higher, with the private sector 40% better off. I know it’s an absurd measurement, but theprime minister’s salaryis 57% lower than had it kept pace with inflation since 2009.In 1948 a Labour government founded the NHS. My job now is to make it fit for the future | Wes StreetingRead moreIn this pay climate, the doctors may lack sympathy. Their last pay rise came out of general NHS funds, paid in part by abolishing NHS England. Dipping into the service again for a 29% claim looks unlikely. Even if more taxes were raised, the NHS already takes40% of departmental spending.The BMA’s language is out of kilter with the times, as it calls the offer “derisory” and “insulting”, with its co-chair saying people are “excited to go again” with strikes. Last time, over half the public backed the doctors strikes: a May YouGov poll finds48% opposedto further strike action, with 39% of voters in favour.I hear there is much complaint about the strike among doctors, but expect very few to dare speak out in public. Clare Gerada, former president of the Royal College of GPs,is one. But her polite objections draw poison on social media. Incidentally, she tells me the high cost of the strike last time was money spent on paying overtime to other doctors, with “consultants … getting above £3,000 to fill in for a weekend”. Consultants are also balloting over pay.England’s 77,000 resident doctors have good reasons to protest – but less over pay than their careers. Their training is gruelling compared with any other students. Due to abysmal stop-go planning by previous health secretaries, 20,000 of them are stuck in a bottleneck, withfive applying for every training post, up from 2:1 five years ago. Streeting says he wants to talk to the BMA about conditions: he has just orderedUK-trained doctorsto take precedence for these posts over their foreign-trained peers, and createdalmost 2,000 more GP postsby changing practices’ hiring finances.Meanwhile, Streeting’s 10-year plan has been greeted with enthusiasm for its principles – prevention, neighbourhood and electronic records – if doubts about delivery. Those of us of who have been following the NHS for decades haven’t enough fingers to count the “long-term plans” and “plans big enough to see from space” that cause acronym storms of administrative upheaval, before another one comes along. But this gets a fair wind for its local clinics starting in poorest places, andpublic support in polling.Popular demand has brought backNye, the National Theatre’s play about the founding of the NHS. By chance I saw it on Wednesday, the day after the strike was announced. Herbert Morrison, a sceptic, warns Nye Bevan (Michael Sheen) that “no health minister has ever persuaded the British Medical Association to agree anything”, greeted by knowing gales of laughter from the audience.Bevan replies: “Exactly. So we have to break the union.” Morrison is astounded at this from a leftist. “They’re middle class, that’s fine,” says Bevan, to even more laughter from an audience that seemed NHS-heavy, and they weren’t laughing in support of doctors. True, battles betweenNHSstaff and politicians rarely end well for health secretaries, but this time the BMA may have overreached.The play ends with a list of facts loudly applauded: “Within 10 years of the NHS being launched, infant mortality fell by 50%.” Support for the NHS is as strong as ever, but anxiety about the state of it will only worsen if its improvement is blocked by strikes.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDoctorsOpinionNHSGPsHealthWes StreetingIndustrial actioncommentShareReuse this content"

Every person in our country has the human right to live free from fear, racism and discrimination. Many positive steps have already been taken to address it. Some measures have gone too far, like the New South Wales government’s law criminalising protest outside places of worship and disproportionate, blanket bans oncertain protests in universities.Australia’s special envoy to combat antisemitism, Jillian Segal, also goes too far in some ways, and not far enough in others in her recently released plan.Segal’s plan goes too far in urging the widespread adoption of the definition of antisemitism prepared by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) in 2016. The definition itself is innocuous enough, essentially addressing bias or hatred towards Jews. Eleven examples are then given to illustrate it.There are three key problems with the IHRA approach. Firstly, it was intended to be a non-binding monitoring and awareness raising tool, not an operational definition for disciplining staff or students, cutting funding to universities or arts institutions, censoring the media or excluding immigrants – strategieswhich appear similar to the Trump Administration’s. It is too vague and broad to operate as a binding instrument of enforcement and punishment. Even its key drafter,Kenneth Stern, opposed its use as a legal or regulatory tool, including in universities.2:27Albanese condemns antisemitism after receiving special envoy Jillian Segal's report – videoSecondly, the IHRA approach is not consistent with human rights and excessively infringes on legitimate freedom of expression. International law allows free speech to be limited where a person incites violence, or national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. United Nations human rights mechanisms and the world’s leading human rights NGOs, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have rejected the IHRA approach.The real problem lies in some of the examples given to illustrate the IHRA definition, which the special envoy wants adopted in Australia even though they are not part of the definition. Many of the examples are not usually problematic, such as inciting violence, harmful stereotypes, collectively blaming Jews, Holocaust denial and “blood libel” tropes. Even these can still be misused, as where mention of “intifada” or wearing a kaffiyeh scarf as a symbol of resistance, regardless of context, is interpreted as violently antisemitic.What is Australia’s proposed antisemitism plan – and why are some parts causing concern?Read moreOther examples – particularly because of how they are weaponised against critics of Israel in practice – are controversial. Example 7, denying Jewish self-determination or claiming that Israel is a racist endeavour, can be invoked to silence, for example, legitimate discussion of a plural “one state” solution to the conflict or lawful chants like “from the river to the sea”. It can also be weaponised to crush critique of how Israel purports to exercise self-determination over land that does not belong to it, as well as Israeli practices of racial segregation or apartheid and religious nationalism.Example 8 refers to applying double standards by requiring of Israel behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. This example clearly conflates criticism of Israel with racism against Jews and does not necessarily have anything to do with antisemitism, although in some cases it could do so. It is also often a red herring. Israel is not generally expected to behave differently to other democracies. It is expected to respect the same international legal standards as other democracies. The unique nature of Israel’s near-60 year occupation of Palestine, unresolved human rights issues stemming from its foundation in 1948 (including refugees, property and compensation), and the severity of Israel’s violations of international law – Israel’s choice – are what makes it a target of accountability efforts, including lawful boycott, divestment and sanctions.Abstract definitions operate in the real world. The vaguer they are, the more they are susceptible to being instrumentalised for political goals. The United Nations human rights mechanisms, including my own, have documented the heavy repression of pro-Palestine speech, protests and organisations in western democracies, including the US, UK, Germany, France and Australia.Personally, I have seen academic conferences and colleagues self-censoring for fear of falling foul of vague and overly broad policies and disciplinary procedures on antisemitism and protest. In some ways the pendulum has swung too far in the wrong direction. It has not been helped by orchestrated campaigns by pro-Israel advocacy groups to smear and bully Israel’s critics, including through aggressive lawfare, and destroy their reputations and livelihoods.The IHRA approach is divisive and controversial, including among Jews. This alone makes its adoption counter-productive, because it can never build the consensus necessary to unify national efforts to effectively combat antisemitism. There are better definitions available, including the Jerusalem Declaration onAntisemitism.Attacks in Melbourne have struck fear into the Jewish community, and do nothing to bring about peace | Josh BurnsRead moreSeparately, Segal’s plan does not go far enough because in identifying the “drivers” of antisemitism, it simplistically blames “extremist ideologies”, as if these mysteriously appeared out of thin air. There is no mention of a totally misguided but nonetheless structural driver of antisemitism – fury at Israel’s profound violations of international law in Gaza. The upsurge in antisemitism in Australia clearly correlates with the 21 months of violence since the atrocious Hamas attack on Israel of 7 October 2023. People did not just inexplicably and without context decide to become more antisemitic in that period.Israeli violations can never justify blaming and attacking Jewish Australians and do not help Palestinians. But the special envoy’s plan will never be effective if it tackles only the symptoms and refuses to acknowledge let alone address a key driver.The government must act in the best interests of all Australians when combating all forms of racism, including to defend free speech and human rights, and not simply genuflect to the incessant, excessive demands of some Jewish voices.Ben Saul is Challis chair of international law at the University of Sydney and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-terrorismExplore more on these topicsAntisemitismOpinionAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Just eyes – heavy and charcoal-drawn – staring in stillness and silence. They don’t accuse. They don’t beg. They simply watch. Peering out of pale, formless faces – a quiet demand to acknowledge their very existence.This is Gazans’ View of the World, a stark monochrome piece by Palestinian artist Nabil Abughanima, one of more than 50 works now on display at Metamorphika Studio in Hackney, London. Together, they formDlúthpháirtíocht– the Irish word for “solidarity” – an exhibition that spans continents, memories and borders, binding Palestinian and Irish histories into a single frame.Born from a poem written by co-curator Seán Óg Ó Murchú in response to the war in Gaza, he describes the exhibition as “the world’s largest international exhibition of contemporary Irish artists” – while providing a safe refuge for the work of Palestinian artists living in exile.Here, the art is not ornamental; it is urgent. Some artists fled Gaza only months ago, while the show itself is itinerant – travelling to Dublin, Cork and Belfast after its London leg ends on 19 July.Among those featured is Abughanima himself, who left Gaza two months ago and now lives in France.“Before the most recent war, I gathered a team of young artists and began building what we hoped would be Gaza’s first independent animation studio,” he says. “I rented a space, equipped it and watched the dream take its first real form. Then the war came. And it took everything.”View image in fullscreen‘The contrast [between Israel and Gaza] is extraordinary’ … a photograph by Seamus Murphy.Photograph: Seamus MurphyHis work wrestles with myth and ancestral stories being under siege. “If those stories are lost,” he says, “the very values upon which global society claims to stand will be lost too.”As you enter the gallery, you are immediately confronted by the works of the acclaimed Irish photographer Seamus Murphy. Though he’s spent over three decades documenting war and migration across the globe, it is his time in Gaza and the West Bank in the mid-2000s that stays with him.One photograph, grainy and dim, captures a group of men among barbed wire fencing, staring down a checkpoint. “It was five in the morning on a Sunday,” Murphy recalls. “I walked with them from their towns, they prayed on the way, before they queued at the crossing. Some were allowed into Israel for work. Many were turned back.“You cannot escape it, when you cross into Israel from Gaza, the contrast is extraordinary: you have unbelievable social chaos and poverty … and then manicured roads and advanced technology. It’s a vivid image of how people are treated under occupation.”Not all the works at the exhibit are realist. Upstairs, at the far end of the room, surrealism replaces reportage. Flying People is a dreamlike canvas by Palestinian artist Amal Al Nakhala who was forced to move from Gaza with her family to Cairo. The piece shows people in the sky, upside down. Below are jagged teeth.Al Nakhala says she “played with symbolism, where the people on the ground become the war plane”, flipping the world on its axis.Her work is not a literal depiction of the war, she says, but an attempt to capture its absurd repetition: “It shows how occupation becomes the norm, and death becomes normalised.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Across it, scrawled in Arabic, are the words “I’m afraid of the dark”. It is a collaboration between Irish artist Spicebag and Scottish artist Council Baby, a stark tribute to five-year-oldHind Rajab, killed by Israeli forces in January 2024 after being stranded in Gaza City in a car with her family. For hours, she pleaded for help over the phone while family members and paramedics lay dead beside her.An investigationfound the car she was in had 335 bullet holes in the car’s exterior.“She stands out,” says Spicebag. “Among so many faceless dead children, there’s a common touch point there, with the emergency call and the desperation in her voice. It’s visceral and horrifying.”For many Irish artists, the connection betweenIrelandand Palestine transcends borders. “There’s nothing in recent Irish history comparable to the scale of destruction in Gaza,” Spicebag says, “but when you see armoured vehicles on residential streets – not there to protect you but to suppress you … it’s buried deep in our psyche.”But this isn’t just symbolic, or a passive act of watching from afar.All proceeds go toDignity for Palestinians, a charity founded by Dr Musallam Abukhalil which provides food, water and nappies to displaced families in Gaza. “The money might go to a food basket, clean water, maybe something small for a camp,” Abukhalil says. “It’s that direct. Art is resistance in Gaza, it always has been.”And sometimes resistance looks like two children, huddled over a slice of bread with Nutella. “There’s a video,” Spicebag says of a clip sent to him from Dignity for Palestine. “These two little girls, eating from one of the food parcels. I’ve never seen anyone so happy. Their eyes just lit up.”Dlúthpháirtíocht is atMetamorphika Studio, London, until 19 JulyExplore more on these topicsArtGazaIrelandIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To celebrate, we remembers its best bits – from hot tub pregnancies to Andrew Tate getting his just desertsMichael HoganFri 11 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 18.39 EDTShareBig Brother house, this is the Guardian. You are live to the nation. Please do not swear. Yes, it’s the show that changed the face of British TV. On 18 July, it’s exactly 25 years since the OG reality franchise took our screens by storm – which will be marked this autumn by an extended 25th anniversary series. So we are celebrating by fast-forwarding through a quarter-century of romances, rows and all-round ridiculousness to pick the greatest hits ofBig Brother– not the celebrity spin-off, otherwise George Galloway being a cat and “David’s dead!” would definitely feature. Instead we’re talking about the original and best civilian edition, whose pioneering 00s pomp came on Channel 4, before the less loved Channel 5 era – which was axed in 2018 until ITV rebooted it two years ago. These are the Endemol classic’s best bits. How many do you remember? Big Brother will get back to you.Welcome to the house of funBB1, July 2000View image in fullscreen‘Innocent times’ … Davina McCall with the first Big Brother winner, Craig Phillips.Photograph: Ken McKay/ShutterstockWe take it for granted now but when the Dutch format arrived on Channel 4, it felt genuinely groundbreaking. Ten punters entered a custom-built, camera-rigged house for the original “social experiment”, with nightly highlight shows and an online live feed (how modern). Davina McCall hosted and over her decade-long stint, became a national treasure. The first intake included lesbian ex-nun Anna Nolan and Darren Ramsay, who chatted to the chickens and named his favourite Marjorie. Innocent times. Well, until …Nasty Nick unmaskedBB1, August 2000The show’s breakout moment came when Liverpudlian builder Craig Phillips, the eventual winner, confronted housemate Nick Bateman about cheating. The City broker, who now lives under another name in Australia, had smuggled in pen and paper, then (gasp!) passed notes to manipulate nominations. The nation was outraged as Nasty Nick’s downfall unfolded in real-time. A panto villain was born and it turned reality TV evil for ever.Helen falls for PaulBB2, May 2001The original BB romance blossomed between Welsh hairdresser Helen Adams (who memorably declared “I like blinking, I do”) and car designer Paul Clarke (who boasted that he “lives like an international pop star”). A world away from today’s shameless Love Island showmances, the endearingly normal couple went on to have a five-year relationship.Brian Dowling’s demonsBB2, July 2001“Hold me, Bubble!” Irrepressible Ryanair flight attendant Brian Dowling was hilarious value and voted the all-time most popular winner. Glimpsing cameras behind the mirrors, he would declare them “Demons!”. He busted out a dance routine to Janet Jackson’s Nasty. Halfway through a buzzcut, he turned sideways and had a conversation with his own shaven-headed alter ego. Dowling would become the first out gay children’s TV presenter on SMTV and later hosted BB’s Channel 5 revival.Alison Hammond’s origin storyBB3, June 2002View image in fullscreenA star is born … Alison Hammond on Big Brother, 2002.Photograph: ITVA star was born when Brummie whirlwind Alison climbed on to a garden table to peek over the wall at the outside world. When the table broke, she headed straight to the Diary Room to confess, offering: “I could probably bend it back?” She finished 11th but won the hearts of viewers and is now a much-loved TV fixture.Tim sneakily shaves his chestBB3, July 2002Late arrival Tim “nice but dim” Culley won few friends by braying his catchphrase “Comprendez?”. He went down in BB lore by shaving off his ginger chest hair under the duvet, thinking nobody would notice – despite the presence of dozens of cameras.Jade’s verrucaBB3, July 2002The late Jade Goody became such a star that she returned for Celebrity Big Brother five years later. Cue a racism controversy which caused an international incident. First time around, though, the dental nurse was endearingly ditsy. Guileless utterances included “Sherlock Holmes invented toilets” and “East Angular – ain’t that abroad?” She didn’t cope well when it was pointed out that she had a verruca, wailing “Am I minging?”Alex works the cameraBB3, July 2002View image in fullscreen‘Stared into viewers’ souls’ … Alex Sibley’s lip-syncing in Big Brother 3.Photograph: ITVHousemates often forget the cameras are there, so it was a spine-tingling moment when finalist Alex Sibley stared straight down the lens and into viewers’ souls. Buttoning his shirt while disco hits played over the tannoy, he lip-synced to KC & the Sunshine Band’s That’s The Way (I Like It), seeming to flirt with the audience at home.Sub-table shenanigansBB5, July 2004It remains a mystery what went on under that tablecloth. BB5 lovebirds Michelle Bass and Stuart Wilson, AKA “Chicken Stu” hid under the kitchen table for some intimate action away from the cameras. When Davina asked for juicy details during her exit interview, Michelle coyly replied “No comment” to squeals from the crowd.Fight Night™BB5, July 2004“No naked jacuzzi-ness!” When Emma Greenwood and Michelle Bass were supposedly evicted, they actually moved to a secret bedsit to follow the house action on screens. This spark lit the fuse for the infamous Fight Night. When the pair made their shock return and booze was imbibed, a blazing row erupted between the resident rival cliques, Lip Gloss Bitches vs Jungle Cats. Food was thrown. Tables were flipped. Greenwood and Victor Ebuwa hit each other with trays. Security guards burst in, the live feed was cut and police were called in to investigate. Highlight or new low? You decide.Nádia takes the crownBB5, August 2004View image in fullscreenNádia Almada, winner of Big Brother series five, 2004.Photograph: Bruno Vincent/Getty ImagesShowering in high heels. Begging for cigarettes while dressed as a camo-clad soldier. Portugal-born Nádia Almada was the first transgender contestant, making it all the sweeter when she won. She feared a backlash from the public, so when she left the house to a rapturous reception, Nádia was poignantly overwhelmed.Kitten without a causeBB5, June 2004Rebellious Kitten Pinder’s stint was short but eventful. A Brighton anarchist who lived in a squat, Kitten Pinder was ejected after just eight days for breaking the rules an impressive 30 times. Only the second housemate after Nasty Nick to be booted out, she refused to nominate, tried to move the alcohol fridge into the bedroom and declined to go to the Diary Room when asked. Naturally, when she was thrown out, she refused to leave, resulting in the prize money being reduced. Days later, Kitten was up in court for non-payment of multiple parking fines. She blamed Tony Blair.Makosi’s phantom hot tub pregnancyBB6, June 2005View image in fullscreen‘I could be pregnant’ … Makosi Musambasi in Big Brother series six, 2005.Photograph: ShutterstockAfter Makosi Musambasi and eventual winner Anthony Hutton got steamy in the jacuzzi, Makosi stunned everyone by going to the Diary Room and whispering “I could be pregnant.” Within hours, she’d told two housemates that she was “90% sure”, vowing to keep the baby and asking Big Brother for a pregnancy test. Spoiler: she wasn’t pregnant. Anthony denied they’d even had sex.The Science bitBB6, July 2005Leeds musician Kieron “Science” Harvey became a cult figure for his argumentative nature and sardonic wit. He was forever baiting Conservative speechwriter Derek Laud, memorably during a cardboard box task. His highlight came when housemates Maxwell, Craig and Anthony sat in a row on the sofa. Self-styled “Citizen Science” pointed at his foes one-by-one and spat: “Tweedledum, Tweedledee and TweedleTWAT.”Wine o’clock for KingaBB6, July 2005View image in fullscreen‘The limits of acceptability’ … Kinga Karokzak’s wine bottle moment in Big Brother 6.Photograph: ShutterstockIt’s an image seared on viewers’ brains. Outrageous late arrival Kinga Karolczak swiftly made an impression by stripping off for hot tub sessions. One tipsy evening took a surprise turn when she tottered into the garden to become, ahem, better acquainted with a wine bottle. Ofcom later said it “operated at the limits of acceptability”.Nikki’s Diary Room rantsBB7, June 2006The late, great Nikki Grahame was the undisputed queen of tantrums and tirades. She complained about the air con (“I’m so cooooold!”) and housemate Richard Newman finishing the cornflakes (“the fat ox!”). Most memorably, she was apoplectic with rage when newcomer Susie Verrico nominated her, despite “not even knowing me”. “Who is she?” shrieked Grahame. “Where did you find her?”Aisleyne says it straightBB7, June 2006Self-confessed “ghetto princess” Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace had a winning way with a put-down. As a late arrival, she soon got the measure of Nikki, telling her: “You better know yourself, little girl.” When she returned in 2015 as a “Time Warp houseguest”, Aisleyne hadn’t lost it. Putting former escort Helen Wood on a bargain budget, she reasoned: “Basic rations for a basic bitch.”Glyn’s got the eggs factorBB7, July 2006If you know, you know. As gawky Welsh teenager Glynn Wise boiled himself some breakfast, he improvised a catchy little song to celebrate: “I’m cooking an egg for the very first time, ah-mmm.” To this day, BB fans of a certain vintage find themselves humming it when cooking eggs. Fun fact: Glyn is now a priest.Pete takes a dipBB7, August 2006View image in fullscreenPete Bennett in Big Brother series seven, 2006.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockWinner Pete Bennett, a Brighton musician with Tourette syndrome, had an unlikely romance with housemate Nikki Grahame and said in his exit interview that Big Brother had saved his life. All very touching but not as funny as when he lost his balance while chatting in the garden and toppled backwards into the pool.Brian Belo wets the bedBB8, July 2007The second Brian to win the show, Essex boy Belo provided all manner of inadvertent lolz. He’d never heard of Shakespeare and insisted “the moon is bigger than the universe”. The morning after one of his “cider binges” – this was before duty-of-care protocols were tightened – Brian admitted having “an accident” during the night. Housemates promised they wouldn’t tell anyone, despite it airing on primetime TV.Mario proposes to LisaBB9, August 2008Warrington fortysomethings Mario Marconi and Lisa Appleton were the first contestants to enter the house as a couple – and super Mario had a surprise in store. He donned black tie, stood on a heart-shaped plinth and popped the question via Love Actually-style placards. Loved-up Lisa said yes and they tied the knot two years later. Aww. Except they’ve since split and Lisa has done tell-all interviews admitting that she has struggled with addiction … to sausages. No, really.Josie Gibbon, more likeBB11, August 2010Like La Hammond, Josie Gibson is another daytime TV favourite who first found fame on BB. The self-confessed “daft Bristolian bird” won the last edition to be shown on Channel 4 with a record 77.5% of the public vote. However, Gibson’s highlight came when she shared her failsafe mood-lifter: “Whenever I’m feeling a bit low, I think: ‘At least I’m not that woman who had her face ripped off by a chimpanzee’.” Relatable.Andrew Tate’s early exitBB17, June 2016This lukewarm later series was mainly notable for a certain Andrew Tate being among the housemates. He was ejected on Day Six after a video emerged which apparently showed him hitting a woman with a belt. Tate claimed it was a prank and he’d been misrepresented. In happier news, this run also saw a Diary Room meltdown from ex-model Jayne Connery, who was “bored shitless by conversations about hair tongs” and asked Big Brother: “Are you fucking on drugs?”Cameron comes outBB19, October 2018A reminder of reality TV as a force for good. The last series of the Channel 5 era saw 18-year-old Cameron Cole come out as gay during a conversation with housemate Lewis. He eventually plucked up the courage to tell the whole house, prompting fellow contestants to cry, clap and congratulate him. The tender moment led to an outpouring of support on social media. Cameron went on to become BB’s youngest ever winner.Three’s a crowdBB20, October 2023The defining storyline of ITV’s reboot was a gay love triangle. Lawyer Jordan and food critic Henry quickly clicked – but two weeks later, Jordan began flirting with doctor Matty, despite him having a boyfriend on the outside. Heartbreakingly, Henry broke down in tears because he’d “lost his best friend” in the house. They sweetly patched things up and Jordan went on to win. After dating for 18 months, the pair amicably split.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBig BrotherReality TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Huge pictures of the Gallagher brothers have been splashed on the side of the city’s yellow buses, and Liam Gallagher’s voice will be making announcements on the Metrolink tram network, telling fans “the next stop is … Heaton Parrrk,” before adding: “off you go”.View image in fullscreenLiam Gallagher’s image on the side of a tram heading to Heaton Park.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianOutside Heaton Park, which will host the gigs, a car drives past with its top down, blasting the lyrics to Live Forever. Fans have been queueing outside the gates since the early hours, hoping to rush for a spot at the barriers as soon as the gates open.‘Never seen buzz like this’: Oasis fever grips Manchester before reunion gigsRead moreMany are wearing the bucket hats that have become synonymous with the band to shield themselves from the unusually warm Manchester sun.Right at the front of the queue is Carley Williams, 27, from Boston, in the US. She has spent more than $15,000 (£11,000) to visit Manchester for two weeks and see five out of six of Oasis’s home town gigs.“I’ve just never been more excited in my life,” she said. “This is like what I’ve lived my life to do, so I just have never experienced this level of anticipation in my life, and I’m just loving every minute of it.”View image in fullscreenCarley Williams in the queue outside Heaton Park.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianWilliams has been in the queue since 4am, desperate to secure a spot at the barrier. “I think we are all in agreement that this is going to be the biggest show of the tour,” she said.Tommaso Caccialupi, 16, and his father, Fulvio Caccialupi, 48, were also some of the first in the queue, having travelled from Rome for the gig.“I’m very excited, because it’s the first time that I’m seeing Oasis live,” Tommaso said. “For me, it’s the best day of my life.”Erick Chanto, 26, from Costa Rica, has been waiting since dawn with friends from Los Angeles and Mexico. They wanted to see Oasis in Manchester, he said, because “it’s their home, we needed to be here”.“I love the people. I mean, it’s amazing. I’ve been to London, but you cannot compare London to Manchester,” he said. “The vibe, the atmosphere, the people, it’s different.”Although, Chanto admits, he wasn’t quite expecting the 28C temperatures. “I feel like I’m in Costa Rica,” he said. “It’s too hot, so I feel like I’m coming home.”While some fans have come hundreds of miles, 18-year-old friends Neve Leckie-Traynor and Lola Toft only had to travel from Didsbury in south Manchester to secure their spot in the queue.“We grew up on [Oasis],” Toft said. “It’s just a part of any child living in Manchester, or any dad or mum living in Manchester, so it just feels very special.”They had come down early, she said, because “if we’ve got tickets, we have to make the most of it”.View image in fullscreenLola Toft, left, and Neve Leckie-Traynor.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“Growing up in Manchester and then seeing these two brothers from Burnage, which is down the road,” Leckie-Traynor said. “In this queue, there’s people from everywhere around the world … it’s just amazing.“It’s reached so far, and that’s where we’re from.”Angel Cisneros, 44, and his wife, Liz Ballesteros, 45, have travelled from Mexico City.

As relations ice over again, what can we learn from this artistic detente?Simon UsborneFri 11 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareOne of the biggest TV hits of the 1960s was Double Your Money, a  kind of low-fi precursor to Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. Its presenter, Hughie Green, was a titan of family entertainment who drew audiences of more than 8 million to the ITV gameshow, in which contestants chose whether to double their prize pot between questions.It was, of course, all about the cash, even if TV-rich in those days involved maximum winnings of £1,000 (about £18,000 in today’s money). The show’s baked-in avarice made the entry in the TV Times for 7pm on 8 November 1966 surprising: “Double Your Money visits Moscow with People to People … the first ever western quiz game in the Soviet Union.”For two consecutive Tuesdays, millions of Britons watched Green and his sidekick Monica Rose present a heavily adapted version of the show from a rudimentary studio in the House of Friendship, a mock-Moorish castle near the Kremlin that served as a theatre for communist propaganda.Subtitled “People to People” in the listings, the show was renamed “Do You Want to Go On?” in Moscow. Money did not feature. Instead contestants competed for points, which could be exchanged for state-made goodies such as toasters and televisions.View image in fullscreen‘But what impressed me most was the excitement and enthusiasm of the audience’ … Hughie Green and Monica Rose on Double Your Money.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThe recordings were beset with technical difficulties. Lights went out, speakers failed. “But what impressed me most was the excitement and enthusiasm of the audience,”recalled show producer Bill Costello in 2018. “To them the show was unusual, different and original and they really got carried away by the competitive spirit.”Viewed from today, the export of a British cash-prize gameshow to Moscow seems fanciful, not least given the current state of relations betweenRussiaand the west. Yet they were in keeping with a wider tradition of cold war cultural exchanges from 1955 until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. This soft-power tit-for-tat involved the shipping of entire ballet, opera and theatre companies as respective governments, and a string of impresarios, swept back the iron curtain to reveal the best each side had to offer.The cultural contest was instigated in Moscow after the death of Stalin in 1953. His successors quickly set about softening relations with the west. “They needed to open up, but they wanted to open up in a kind of controlled way,” says Sarah Davies, a history professor at Durham University, who is working on a book about these exchanges.View image in fullscreen‘Everything was exotic’ … The Moiseyev Dance Company.Photograph: University of Southern California/Corbis/Getty ImagesWithin weeks of Stalin’s fatal stroke, Lilian Hochhauser, a London impresario with Russian heritage, began to shuttle top dancers and musicians between the countries, including Mstislav Rostropovich, Dmitri Shostakovich and Benjamin Britten. Hochauser, who is now 98, said in 2019 that a mutual cultural appetite that had flourished during the Anglo-Soviet allyship in the second world war had only grown under Stalin. “Everybody wanted to see the folk-dance companies from the Ukraine, the Moiseyev Dance Company,”she told the Times.“Everything was exotic. Because it had been such a closed book for so long.”London initially feared the propaganda potential in such swaps and used the British Council to exert its own control. The first sanctioned visit arranged under its auspices came in 1955 when the 30-year-old director Peter Brook took Hamlet to Moscow, with Paul Scofield in the leading role. It was doubly symbolic; Stalin had hated Hamlet. “It had almost been taboo,” Davies says of the play.The Soviet regime also sought legitimacy in the patronage of such heavyweights as Scofield, Britten and even Hughie Green. Stars would be given tours of key Soviet sites, captured by news crews whose films could be narrated as each side saw fit. “How do they live, these mysterious human beings, once our wartime allies but always an unknown quantity to us,” a narrator says in clipped English over a 1965Pathé news filmof Olivier touring Moscow, where the National Theatre was staging Othello a year after the Bolshoi had visited London.By then, the risks of these exchanges had become dramatically apparent, with the defection of Rudolf Nureyev during a Kirov Ballet tour of Europe. Before that, in 1958, MI5 were caught on the hop when Michael Redgrave secretly met his old Cambridge friend and notorious double agent Guy Burgessduring another tour of Hamlet in Moscow. In an intercepted letter to his mother, Burgess said the men had enjoyed “fine gossips” and that Redgrave had been “much better than Paul Scofield” as Hamlet. But such high-profile brushes with scandal failed to close the curtain on the project, which had been formalised in 1959 with the Anglo-Soviet Cultural Agreement between the British Council and its Soviet counterpart.It wasn’t all Shakespeare and ballet. Some cultural exchanges continued to take place outside the official agreement. The British Council had no role in the Double Your Money episodes, which were hosted by MoscowTelevisionduring a relative thaw, before the Red Army crushed the 1968 Prague Spring, an attempt by Czechoslovakia to loosen Moscow’s grip. This perhaps partly explains the knockabout tone of the TV Times coverage of the enterprise. “Caviar for breakfast? Well, why not? At 7s 6d for a large dollop, it’s a fabulous buy,” wrote Dave Lanning, a columnist and ITV darts commentator, who joined Green for a tour of Moscow.In 1976, Cliff Richard became the first major western pop musician to visit Moscow. He later recalled being given an ornate tea urn in exchange for a pair of his blue jeans. To the delight of fans who had devoured bootlegged records by the Beatles et al, more big names followed in the 1980s, particularly during glasnost, Mikhail Gorbachev’s attempts to open up. Elton John made the trip. Billy Joel crowd surfed in Leningrad while draped in the American and Russian flags.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But, by 1988, James Birch, a provocative 32-year-old London art curator, spied an opportunity. He had befriended Sergei Klokov, an enterprising KGB agent, and conspired with him to put on a Francis Bacon exhibition in Moscow.Birch says the artist, whom he had known since childhood, was buzzing. “He even went out and bought himself a Walkman and learned Russian on cassette,” he says. In the end, the notoriously capricious Bacon decided not to go, but 400,000 Russians filed through the city’s Central House of Artists to see his work.Birch and Klokov teamed up again in April 1990, in the dying days of the USSR, to take Gilbert & George to Moscow. The exhibition was another hit, and open to interpretation. While looking at Coming (1983), in which the artists look up at a sky filled with flying underpants, a Russian man told Birch he thought it represented the west invading Russia, with the pants symbolising war planes or parachutes.Whether these exchanges played any significant role in hastening the demise of the Soviet Union remains a matter of debate. Davies says cultural figures who appeared through the iron curtain sometimes overestimated their influence. “It was part of this whole triumphalist narrative that the west undermined the Soviet system because we presented this better, brighter alternative, but I think a lot of scholars challenge that,” she says.View image in fullscreenBack in the USSR … Paul McCartney performing in Red Square in 2003.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThe tradition of cultural exchanges endured after the cold war, and visits continued to serve the Kremlin as an opportunity to sell its legitimacy on an international stage. In 2003, Paul McCartney performed Beatles hits in a landmark Red Square concert. Vladimir Putin, three years into his presidency, was enthusiastic. Over tea, he told McCartney the Beatles’ music had been “like a gulp of freedom … an open window to the world”. When Putin arrived halfway through the gig, McCartney played Back in the USSR, his 1968 parody of western patriotism.‘It was like a toxic relationship’: the exiled Russian musicians starting again abroadRead moreTwo decades later,Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has plunged cultural relations into a new ice age. “It reminds me of the Stalin years, when there was no contact at all,” Davies says. But she has noticed a slight softening. In September, the Russian soprano Anna Netrebko is due to perform at the Royal Opera House in London, three years after New York’s Metropolitan Opera dropped her for refusing to denounce Putin, whom she had supported (she later criticised his invasion andsued the Met).In the meantime, the battle for ideas is playing out on new stages.Godfrey Cromwell, a hereditary peer and the director of The British East-West Centre, formerly the The Great Britain-USSR Association, says the use of social media as a propaganda tool has become more important than physical exchanges. Such accounts, he says,“can deliver focused messages to far larger audiences at far less cost”.Regardless of their diplomatic potential, cultural exchanges have always opened windows to the people behind the regimes. As Bill Costello put it, decades after Double Your Money’s unlikely jolly in Moscow: “It was an incredible experience and a very human one – because underneath all the language problems and differences in culture it certainly proved to me that people are the same the world over.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDanceBalletTheatreRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Six hot comedy debuts at Edinburgh fringe 2025Molly McGuiness is treating audiences to a buffet, sketch troupe Simple Town bring fast-paced fun and Jessica Barton plays Mary Floppins … Here are half a dozen essential acts at the festivalRachael HealyFri 11 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 08.51 EDTShareMolly McGuinness: Slob“There should be a buffet at every comedy gig,” says Manchester-based Molly McGuinness – and luckily for us, she’s making that happen for her Edinburgh debut. Her laugh-packed sets, served with snacks and a warm conversational style, are inspired by the standup ofCaroline Aherne. “I like it to feel as if I’m talking to a friend,” she says. Slob began as a turning-30 existential crisis about reaching your potential, but when a rare disease left McGuinness in a coma, everything shifted. She will share the “bizarre and surreal” experience of coma-induced delirium, tender reflections on “the sweetness of the nurses” that cared for her, and a blossoming love story. “A lot of people feel like a slob, but we’re doing the best we can,” she says.Monkey Barrel, 28 July–24 AugustSimple TownUS group Simple Town make consistently brilliant short films, where everyday conundrums (what’s the meaning of “adroit”? What happens if you’re late for a funeral?) escalate to extremes, or descend into meta-narratives about the absurdity of online content. The foursome, who started performing regularly in New York around 2017, are bringing an hour of “pure sketch comedy” for their fringe debut. Their previous visits to the UK sold out fast. “Our work is somewhere between alternative and crowd-pleasing. Sometimes it’s brainy, ‘comedian’s comedian’ humour, but we also work very hard for the shows to be silly, broad, fast-paced, and fun,” they say. “So hopefully, both kinds of audiences will find something in the show to hate.”Pleasance Courtyard, 11–24 AugustView image in fullscreenJessica Barton in Dirty Work.Photograph: Paul WestbrookDirty WorkAustralian performer Jessica Barton started out in musical theatre and got her first taste of comedy at French clown school Gaulier. She began to “play using song and movement, physical comedy and clowning”, moved to London and immersed herself in its alternative comedy scene. Dirty Work combines her vocal talents with playful audience interaction. In character as Floppins – a Mary Poppins-esque figure intent on cleaning up the stage – she cleverly explores gendered domestic roles. “Expect to have a lot of fun,” she says. “Expect to be challenged and to rise to the occasion. Especially the men in the audience.” Dirty Work was awarded best newcomer at Melbourne international comedy festival and as she gets deeper into the character: “I’ve enjoyed finding new things within the world I’ve created.”Underbelly Cowgate, 31 July–24 AugustAyoade Bamgboye: Swings and RoundaboutsHer assured presence and sideways perspective make Ayoade Bamgboye stand out on any lineup, despite having only three years of live comedy under her belt. She had been working as a writer when someone suggested she try it and Bamgboye is always experimenting, incorporating clowning, multimedia forays and different personae into her performances. She “grew up between London and Lagos” and gives a unique twist on observational comedy: “I’m looking at everything as if I’m on safari. I’m a curious silly billy.” Bamgboye says her comedy has sometimes been “confrontational and caustic” with spicy punchlines on racism and colonialism, but with her debut she’s ready to be more vulnerable, too: “Audiences should expect something bittersweet.”Pleasance Courtyard, 30 July–24 AugustView image in fullscreenSharon Wanjohi: In the House.Photograph: Rebecca NeedmenearSharon Wanjohi: In the HouseShe first tried standup at university in Southampton (“We had a comedy society where all the nerds went”) and quickly racked up finalist spots at the Funny Women and BBC new comedy awards. Now, Sharon Wanjohi is making her fringe debut with a show about self-help culture and the zeitgeisty coping mechanisms that are “shoved down our throats” every day. “I’m presenting myself as this 90s talkshow host, in the mould of Trisha and Oprah”, Wanjohi says. “I’m satirising self-help, but also breaking out of character to do standup.” You’ll get a gen Z spin on societal issues like the housing crisis, but something “goofy, silly, less grounded in reality,” Wanjohi promises.Pleasance Courtyard, 30 July–24 AugustRoger O’Sullivan: FekkenThis 90s-tinted debut from Irish comedian Roger O’Sullivan explores his relationship with his farmer father via Tekken and the rest of young Roger’s favourite PlayStation games. He started out on Cork’s small comedy scene eight years ago, where “there weren’t really any stakes, so any gig you’d do something new and try the weirdest thing. That’s the mentality I’ve had from early on.” He’s had success online with lo-fi animations, which he works into the show to great effect. “I wanted to end with a callback to retro video games and thought it would be really funny if I learned 3D animation just for that.” Expect warm standup that melds “a little bit of heart with absurdism”.Hoots @ The Apex, 2–23 AugustExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalFestivalsTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now 83, Idle is thriving and about to embark on his first UK tour since 1973.Over haddock and chips in London last month, a gentle and friendly Idle answered questions submitted by readers and fellow writers, actors and comedians about his time as a Python, Broadway smash Spamalot – his musical adaptation ofMonty Pythonand the Holy Grail – as well as selfies, Peter Cook and why he feels sorry for the royals.What’s genuinely funny about Donald Trump?Tracey UllmanThere’s nothing funny about Donald Trump. What will be funny is when he leaves office and we have a big party and dance in the streets. Trump seems to have no end of capacity for stupidity. I think he’s a treasonous monster who works for Putin.Every summer I go to France because I can’t stand the news. I can’t stand hearing about that man every minute of every day. They’re completely obsessed by him in the US. It’s like they’re addicted to him.Since you have made so many people happy to laugh or sing out loud, what’s the best thing in a day that gives you a smile?traleebobMy friends are either comedians or musicians, so we play and sing all the time and I like that. It’s lovely because you are not yourself any more. You are part of this human thing going on. What makes me proudest is thatAlways Look on the Bright Side of Lifehas become a funeral song. I find that very moving.View image in fullscreenIdle as Mr Cheeky, looking on the bright side in Monty Python’s Life of Brian, 1979.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyYou’ve taught generations to laugh at death, class, religionand even bad theatre.Is there anything left you haven’t skewered that you still dream of turning into a joke?Catherine Zeta-JonesThat’s a difficult question. If I thought of it, I would! I think the point of comedy is to examine everything. It’s very scary now because they’re stopping comedians at the border and if they have pictures of Trump on their phone they don’t like, they don’t let them in.I’ve had a green card for about 28 years. I’d be proud to be thrown out because I’d be in very select company. The last English comedian to bethrown out of America for political reasons was Charlie Chaplin.Whether you can go too far in comedy depends on who you are. If you’re Lenny Bruce, you would begin by going too far. But I do take note of it. If I’m going to do a tour, I will ask my goddaughter: can I say this? There are certain categories of people you don’t want to offend, who have been laughed at, and that was completely unjust and unfair. But I think you are obliged to question things to have any relevance at all. Otherwise, you’re just telling jokes.I know people coming up and asking for selfies and such would be a problem in the real world, but are you able togo and just sit in a pub for a few drinks orhave a Sunday dinner in peace in public?HarrymeadowsI used to be really unpleasant. Then Robin Williams taught me that that sort of encounter is very important to people. So be nice, not brusque, because they’ll never forget it. But you don’t want to spend 20 minutes with them, so when they come up, I say: “I’m Eric, what’s your name?” Then they become a person and see you as a person, too. There’s a human connection, not some stupid, starry thing. It becomes more normal and easier to leave.View image in fullscreenOlivia Arias, with George Harrison, who she married in 1978, Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam at the premiere of Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Hollywood in July 1975.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlamyGeorge Harrisonagreed to fund Lifeof Brian because he wanted to see it. If he hadn’tbeen so forward-thinking andunfazed by controversy,might we have lost an iconic, groundbreaking movie?Les DennisHe changed my life. We were very close. I was there at his deathbed. He wasn’t frightened of death. Hethought he’d escape rebirth. I said: “I’d give anything to be reborn.” Only thing we ever disagreed on. He still laughed when I said it.A lot of being funny is the lack of a censor mechanism. I said at George’s funeral: “I’d like to thank Marlboro, without whom you wouldn’t be here this morning.” Huge laugh. It’s really not the right thing to say, but also, let’s name the names of people responsible. The way people respond to comedy is not to think and then decide to laugh. They find themselves laughing spontaneously. And they also start to trust that this person will tell the truth no matter what.I think aliens have a sense of humour, because it’s about self-knowledge. Every society has one, as do some animals. AI, meanwhile, can only copy. I don’t think it would ever say something remarkably and originally funny. That’s its weakness.Do you listen to audiobooks?RDMillerI’m a big reader but it’s the voice of the author I want to hear in my head. I think a lot of the audiobook business is a scam. They pay badly. They rip you off and you work for days reading the damn thing. And I never want to hear my voice back.I’ve read, presumably based on Monty Python andBeyond the Fringe,that nice people went to Oxford, and not so nice people went to Cambridge. Any thoughtson this?MaldontykeThat’s absolute bollocks. All politicians went to Oxford, because they do PPE, and the nice, clever people went to Cambridge. I like Cambridge people.Which comedian, from any time, do you believe would havecomplemented the Pythons ensemble?BanjoPlayingFoolDan Aykroyd, because he was a writer and a performer and could melt his ego into a crowd. On the whole, we didn’t try and upstage each other on Python. You were supportive.View image in fullscreenIdle in front of Palace theatre, London, while themusical Spamalotwas being set up in 2006.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianWithout going into specific facts and figures, how muchmoremoney have you made from Spamalot thanMonty Python’s Flying Circus and, given that many of the core elements were generated from the efforts of the whole circus,do your former comedy teammates get a ton of royalties from Spamalot?(I’m assuming not).DrJWCCThey got more fucking money than they’ve ever been grateful for. They got fucking millions and they’re miserable and horrible and bitchy about it. I spent 20 years working for Python and then two years on the O2 show. They were there for two weeks.I’m not really motivated by money, to be honest. Anyway, the producers get all the fucking money and divide it up according to the contract. Someone sued us for years, saying I was paying the Pythons money from my back pocket. And I said: why would I risk going to an American jail to give John Cleese more money?Pythons always played the women – why? Michael Palin told me it was because you were all scared of them.Tracey UllmanWell, he’s definitely scared of them. I wasn’t scared of women because when I was president of Footlights, then an all-male club, I changed the laws to admit women. The first woman who came in was Germaine Greer. It’s always hard to find a funny woman if you don’t admit them to the club. I was very proud of doing that.I think some of them were scared of women. John Cleese and Graham Chapman were very nasty to Miriam MargolyesI think the reason was that six people were just trying to grab a decent role. But if the joke was about sex, it was better if we had a real woman – it was weird otherwise. But if it was about our mothers, it was funnier it we played them.I think some of themwerescared of women.John Cleese and Graham Chapman were very nasty to Miriam Margolyesand she’s hated them ever since. I always have to remind her that we were friends and I stayed at her apartment. It wasn’t all of us. But most of that generation were terribly cruel.In the early70s, I was toldthat “Nurse Idle”, who gave me my school vaccinations, was in fact yourmum. Could this have been true, or have I been living under a heinous misapprehension for50 odd years. If itistrue, then it counts as the closest I’ve ever got to a celebrityConradTurnerOh yes, that’s true. She did give school vaccinations andshe would have hated Robert F Kennedy Jrbecause she knew how important they were.I love your songs and sing them frequently, including the now unacceptableILike Chinese, which increasingly just sounds like pragmatic foreign policy. But how did it feel in those early days being the Python who wasn’t part of a writing team, given there was Chapman/Cleese and Jones/Palin, and then Gilliam as the fully odd one out?Steve CooganI don’t like being part of a writing team because I don’t like talking before lunch. I wake about 5:30am and love discovering what’s in your mind. You don’t judge it, you just find it, write it and create it, and then do a lot of rewriting.View image in fullscreen‘We bonded immediately’ … Idle, left, with George Harrison and John Cleese in Monty Python’s Life of Brian.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyWhat was hard was that the other Pythons had two votes to one. When I first met George Harrison, we bonded immediately and talked all night and I realised we played the same roles in our groups. There were these two heavy, powerful blocs, and we were in the middle. We didn’t have as much power but we learned a lot from it.And actually I did find somebody I could work with: the musician John Du Prez, who was a brilliant partner for 44 years. He could do everything I couldn’t and it was fabulous.Other than George Harrison, what was your relationship like with the other three Beatles? Did you count them as friends too?JwillchadI’m still a friend of Ringo’s, and Paul’s always very nice and friendly, but we’re not close.If you could have written one song, which one would it be, and why?ThankYouJohnSong to the Moon, from the opera Rusalka by Dvořák. Beautiful. Unbelievably fine. But I don’t feel: oh gosh, I wish I’d written, say, a Beatles song, because they did it so well.You always seemed to perform so unselfconsciously and with so much abandon and joy – and write so efficiently and quickly and confidently.Was there ever a timeyou were insecure about your work,either as a writer or an actor?And if so, what did you do to overcome those self-doubts and nerves?Hank AzariaI think the answer to that isars est celare artem– “the art is to hide the art”, which is the motto of the Footlights. There’s a great deal of work and effort that goes into making it look effortless. The secret of performing comedy is to really know what you’re gonna do.Even now, I’m never secure, but always exploring and trying to improve. I don’t feel I write; I feel I rewriteWhenever you start, you’re insecure. If you feel secure, you’re a bit of an arsehole. And even now, I’m never secure, but always exploring and trying to improve. I don’t feel I write; I feel I rewrite. Spamalot was about 17 drafts. It got better as my mind resolved things. That’s what I do when I perform: I write a draft, and another, and I keep going until I’m confident with every bit. It’s always a theorem for me: if I say this, they may laugh. And then you find out.I remember once that the Pythons were on the Tonight Show. We’d been over in Canada touring and they laughed like crazy at everything we did. But on the Tonight Show they were just silent. We did 20 minutes, then ran outside and we laughed and laughed and laughed. There’s nothing funnier than people not laughing at you.The day this will be published is my birthday, so, relatedto that, whathas been your favourite celebration of your birthday?NanuI think the older you get, the less you like to celebrate your birthday. On my 80th, I had my friend Puddles do a Pity Party. I don’t like being the centre of attention like that. It’s a bit embarrassing. In my private life, I’m not well-known; I come somewhere below the dogs. Nobody goes: “Oh, good morning, legend!” I live a very quiet life.View image in fullscreenPeter Cook, right, with the cast of Beyond the Fringe, from left, Jonathan Miller, Alan Bennett, and Dudley Moore in 1964.Photograph: Ronald GrantWhich comedian, living or dead, do you most admire?Jane LeevesPeter Cook, Billy Connolly, Robin Williams, Eddie Izzard. I would say my comedic voice is somewhere between Eric Morecambe and Peter Cook. When I was growing up, I loved Frankie Howerd and Jimmy Edwards. Comedians used to go from place to place doing the same act and lots of them were really funny but TV finished them off, because they couldn’t adapt or write enough new material.In the oncoming revolution that may sweep the UK, whose side will you be on – and what to do with the royals?DarknessI don’t think there’ll be a revolution in England. They’ve already screwed my life up, anyway. Eight years ago [pre-Brexit], I could live in any country in Europe. Now, I can only spend three months a year in my house in Provence, and I built the bloody place.I’ve lived in LA for 30 years, but it seems to me that the UK class system is still just as prevalent. I think it’s a complete waste of time and it filters down. It stops some people – and it spoils others.View image in fullscreenInspiration … Frankie Howerd at the Lyric, Hammersmith, in 1990.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianI feel really sorry for the royals. Sometimes they’re very nice and human, and other times they become monsters, because if you are called “Sir” at five, you are putting trouble into people. King Charles is very funny. He was at Cambridge. He did comedy and loved Spike Milligan and would always come to Billy Connolly’s. But it’s not a society I would be happy to live in.The thing I like about America is it created itself; it’s the only place that wrote a script for itself. But it needs a rewrite to bring it up to date. The second amendment says at 16 you are allowed a major weapon of war. I really think they’re serious about wanting to get rid of liberals and lefties. They’re very crazy.You’ve described feeling abandoned when you were placed in a boarding school agedseven, and you’ve also said you like living in the USbecause you’re “more comfortable not feeling a part of everything”. Do you think the sense of detachment that comes from being a foreigner is always a response to childhood trauma?CharlesosbournepragueYes, I was abandoned, but I like being a foreigner. I like living in France because they’re very nice to me, and it isn’t my culture so you don’t have to worry. And it’s slightly like that in America.View image in fullscreenWith his daughter, Lily, and wife, Tania, in Hollywood, in 2002.Photograph: Maury Phillips/WireImageWhen I’m in the UK, I miss the wife and the daughter, but when I’m in the US I don’t really miss the UK because I have the football and cricket on.Are you going to smashTitus Andronicus orIago for us one of these days? Or is“shouting at night”, as Ralph Richardson once calledit,too damned tiring? I’d queue overnight for you.Janet SuzmanNo, I’ve done my Shakespeare, back in Cambridge. I couldn’t do it every night. I don’t know how people do Broadway – eight performances a week! On tour, I insist on having a night off after each show. The audience want your energy. You need to be fully there and as confident as possible in order to relax them.Janet was brilliant in Nuns on the Run. Amazing actor. And Robbie Coltrane was wonderful. Michael Palin turned that part down, but it was much better with Robbie. He was just so funny as a nun.What didn’t people realise about Robin Williams?bumbleThat he was so sick. I’d invited him to perform in the O2 shows. He said he didn’t want to and I said: ‘Never mind, just come to the last night.’ He was going to but didn’t. And shortly after came this really shocking thing: he killed himself. Next door to his wife, too.It makes you very paranoid. The only good thing about Robin’s death is that Lewy body dementia is more recognised as a disease and people put money into it. His suffering was enormous.Some of the songs you have written havebecome iconic.Did you realise thatthis was the direction your abilities were heading inas a young Python?Suzy Eddie IzzardI began to play guitar aged 12 when Elvis came up. At Cambridge, I first learned a lot from Bill Oddie, who wrote really funny songs with great lyrics, like Flanders and Swann or Tom Lehrer.I just wonder, in your view, whatyou thinkis the solution tothe narcissistic oafs of this world getting into power?TheRandinatorPeople with narcissistic personality disorder are always headed for power, so I would have them psychoanalysed before they can be elected. Mental health checks would stop them.Do you know where I left my keys?David MametThat’s very funny. David once said the funniest thing he ever heard was the speech I made at Mike Nichols’ 75th birthday.

The erstwhile Man of Steel, who played the last son of Krypton on TV in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman from 1993 to 1997, thinks James Gunn has gone too far with hisdescription of Kal-Elas an “immigrant that came from other places and populated the country” in the new DC film.Speaking to TMZ, Cain pondered: “How woke is Hollywood going to make this character? How much is Disney going to change their Snow White? Why are they going to change these characters [to] exist for the times?”Here’s the thing (and you might think Cain had picked this up given he actually played the guy)Supermanhas actually been woke since 1938. Created by two Jewish teenagers from Cleveland, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, he was a child of the Great Depression, standing up for the little guy, fighting Nazis (as well as corrupt politicians, crooked landlords and wartime saboteurs). In many ways he represented the ultimate immigrant fantasy: assimilated, adored, and just powerful enough to completely knock injustice into next week.In fact, superheroes (and more recently superhero movies) have always been the genre equivalent of a protest sign in a wind tunnel: loud, colourful, occasionally hard to read, but very much trying to say something. Captain America was literally invented to punch Nazis – the first issue of Timely Comics’ Captain America Comics #1 famously featured him socking Hitler in the jaw – months before the US officially entered the second world war. If that’s not performative virtue signalling, I’m not sure what is.View image in fullscreenVirtue signalling … Chris Evans v bad guys in Captain America: Winter Soldier.Photograph: Marvel Studios/AllstarIn 1946 (on the radio), Superman took down a thinly veiled version of the Ku Klux Klan in a 16-part storyline titled “Clan of the Fiery Cross”. The show’s writers used real-life intel from anti-racist activist Stetson Kennedy, who had infiltrated the Klan and passed on details of its secret codes and rituals. It is widely cited as one of the earliest and most effective examples of mass media activism, and certainly a lot more politically brazen than anything Gunn is planning.And yes, there might have been a brief period in the 1950s in which Cap seemed to be weirdly repositioned as Joseph McCarthy’s commie-bashing errand boy (in the comics). But that whole era was so awkwardly jingoistic thatMarveleventually retconned it entirely, blaming it all on an impostor.As superheroes transitioned to the big screen from the late 1970s onwards, the original Superman movie emerged in 1978 amid the post-Watergate, all-American desire for a hero who didn’t lie, cheat, embezzle, wiretap, bomb Cambodia, or resign in disgrace with jowls full of self-pity and a suitcase full of un-shredded indictments.By the early 00s,X-Menhad turned its spandex into a metaphor delivery system, giving us a mutant civil rights allegory so on the nose it basically came out during the opening credits. Whether it was Magneto as militant separatist, Professor X as an integrationist who uses a wheelchair, or teenagers being grilled about their DNA in suburban living rooms, this was identity politics in Lycra, with just enough laser eyes to distract from the social realism. Nobody seemed to mind a bit that Mystique changed sex at will, Rogue needed gloves to avoid unsolicited intimacy, and the whole film played like a coming-out parable in leather – because for all its subtext, X-Men still delivered the spectacle fans came for.View image in fullscreenAbout to have an epiphany … Robert Downey Jr in 2008’s Iron Man.Photograph: Marvel/AllstarAnd then of course there was the Marvel Cinematic Universe proper, kicking off with 2008’sIron Man.

The nuance, the guilt, the faint whiff of accountability in a billion-dollar franchise. The absence of the sort of “all-American” values last seen in a deleted scene from Team America that was deemed too on-the-nose. And yet ultimately, if superheroes aren’t about subverting the powerful, sticking up for the underdogs, and punching moral cowardice squarely in the jaw, what exactly is the point?Superman review – is it a bust? Is it a pain? James Gunn’s dim reboot is bothRead moreThis is not to say that there haven’t been intriguing rightwing superheroes over the decades, though it’s rare that any of these have really ended up looking like someone you’d trust with a moral compass. Take Watchmen’s Comedian, casually blasting Vietnamese villagers like a walking nightmare of national militarism cranked to 11 and handed a flame-thrower. Or Gunn’s own Peacemaker, a cautionary tale about what happens when you mix a very dim man with a blind devotion to “peace through strength” and a fondness for ends-justify-the-means patriotism. Then there’s The Boys’ Homelander: an authoritarian, populist psychopath in stars and stripes.Of course what Cain et al would really like to see is a Superman who mirrors all of these leanings without any of the obviously bad stuff: the fascist overtones, the laser-eyed jingoism and the genocidal meltdowns. The only problem here is that such a character doesn’t exist, or at least, would be pretty boring to watch. Because once you strip out truth, justice, compassion, doubt, and any hint of moral complexity, what you’re left with isn’t a superhero: it’s a Maga-friendly screensaver with heat vision, great hair and absolutely no sense of irony.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSuperman (Film)Superman (Culture)DC ComicsIron ManX-MenMarvelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bands including Less Than Jake, the Ataris and AFI pay tribute to a gaming megastar who loves them backTom ReganFri 11 Jul 2025 05.40 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Jul 2025 19.22 EDTShareWhen millions of parents bought their kids a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater game in the late 90s and early 00s, they couldn’t have understood the profound effect it would have on their children’s music taste. With bands from Bad Religion to Papa Roach and Millencolin accompanying every failed spin and grind, these trick-tastic games slyly doubled up as the ultimate compilation CD.While the Fifa games have an equally storied history with licensed music, those soundtracks feel impersonal – a who’s who of whichever artists EA’s associated record labels wanted to push at the time. Pro Skater’s soundtrack, by contrast, felt like being handed a grubby and slightly dog-eared handmade mixtape, still battered from its last tumble at the local skate park.“Most of the bands were chosen because I heard them growing up at the skate park. I would say most of the original punk stuff – even the early hip-hop – that was my soundtrack to skating in the 80s and 90s,” Tony Hawk says. “I never imagined that I would be a tastemaker but, that was really just a byproduct of staying true to the culture.”“Tony was very involved in punk rock,” says Chris DeMakes, frontman of Less Than Jake, before his set at this year’s Slam Dunk festival. “Ultimately, he had to approve the bands on his soundtrack … So that always kind of made me feel good about it.” The band’s Roger Lima adds: “The culture of skating and music is so meshed, it made sense for them to have a real soundtrack to it.”For the bands that made it on to these games in those years, the impact was immeasurable. “I remember playing earlier versions of THPS and hearing some of our contemporaries … I hoped we’d get an opportunity like that,” says Hunter Burgan, bassist of AFI. “But I don’t think I really understood how big the impact was until after we actuallywereon the soundtrack. I can’t tell you how many people have come up to me over the last two decades and told me that THPS3 was their first introduction to AFI.”View image in fullscreen‘Tony had to approve the bands on his soundtrack so that made me feel good about it’ … Less Than Jake.Photograph: Piers Allardyce/Rex/Shutterstock“Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater made All My Best Friends Are Metalheads a hit – as big a hit as if we would have been on 60 major rock stations in America … Probablybigger,” says DeMakes. “I talked to John Feldman [of Goldfinger] about this recently, and with Superman it’s the same thing for them. That wasn’t a worldwide hit, but itbecamea hit for them because of that game.”When the original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater came out in 1999, those grey PlayStation discs served as a punk rock Trojan horse, sneaking a killer introduction to the world of alt and punk music to millions of unsuspecting kids. A quarter-century later, new artists are featuring on modern remakes of the Pro Skater games, alongside the bands that shaped their taste.“Those games fully altered my taste in music!” says Sammy Ciaramitaro, vocalist of hardcore band Drain. “They brought punk rock (and a lot of other incredible music) to my childhood bedroom.” Drain are now one of a handful of new artists that were chosen to be added to the soundtrack for the remakes.“I think our inclusion represents the growth of hardcore,” says Ciaramitaro. “I’m honored that we now get to be a part of this with Turnstile and End It, too. I hope that maybe some young kids will hear our songs while playing and it will motivate them to do a deep dive into punk rock music, like we all did when we were younger.”Other bands who weren’t quite big enough to get on Tony’s radar at the time, such as the Ataris, spent their careers dreaming of making it on to the next Pro Skater game. “We were coming of age the same time that Pro Skater was,” says bassist Mike Davenport. “In 1999/2000 was when we really started to take off as a band and we didn’t even feel as if we belonged with the bands that were featured [on the games].” The Ataris’ track All Souls’ Day eventually made the soundtrack for 2020’s Pro Skater 1+2 remake.Davenport says that the band used to play Pro Skater constantly on tour in the back of an RV – even, once, in the middle of a car accident. “My merch guy and I were playing in the kitchen nook one night when we heard the driver yell ‘look out!’ and then the TV flew at us, and we both literally batted it down with our hands so as not to have it smash us in the face,” he remembers. “Sadly the TV and PlayStation were killed, but luckily not us.”View image in fullscreenDavey Havok performing with AFI in 2007.Photograph: Reuters/AlamyEven though Less Than Jake reaped the rewards of being on the game back in 2002, returning with a different song on the Pro Skater remake decades later still felt like a badge of honour: “We’re a band that’s been around for 33 years, so we love anything that can propel us and get us in front of a new audience,” says DeMakes, “Everybody has social media. Anybody can upload their song to YouTube or Spotify or Apple Music now, it’s a different playing field. So how do you get noticed? Getting asked to be in a video game is perfect.”“As long as there are people playing video games there will be an avenue to connect them with music,” says Burgan, “Skateboarding, punk rock and video games were a huge part of our lives growing up and were inextricably connected, so it seems like a natural continuation of that. For bands, I think the cultural impact is far more important and lasting than any financial benefit.”Such is the lasting impact of the Pro Skater soundtracks that there are cover bands dedicated to playing it live – among them the 900. “We were really annoying when we first started the band, just tagging Tony Hawk in every story and Instagram post,” frontman Harry Shaw tells me. “When he followed us [on social media] we thought: ‘That’s it, we’ve made it.’ We never imagined that he’d actually come on stage with us.”In a video that’s since gone viral on Instagram,Tony Hawk hopped on stage unannouncedwith the 900 in east London, covering Bloodstains by Agent Orange and Superman by Goldfinger, to a rapturous crowd. “[We’re] eternally grateful for him doing that show, and also just not being a dick about bands covering songs from his game, either,” says Shaw, “He doesn’t have to do this stuff, his name is so big within pop culture – like Ronaldo or Messi – he’s almost like a living meme.”View image in fullscreen‘I can’t sing every song’ … Tony Hawk on stage with the 900 in London in 2022.Photograph: Doug Young“There are five bands that only play covers from our video game series, and I’ve sang with three of them. But that one [the 900] was really fun,” says Hawk. “My appearance was a surprise, and they were kind enough to choose songs that I was more into. Yes, I’m proud of the soundtrack, but I can’t sing every song nor could I remember the lyrics!”In the decades that have passed since the original Pro Skater games, their soundtracks have been the gift that keeps giving for the bands who make it on. “I actually just met Tony a few weeks ago at a music festival,” says AFI’s Burgan. “He is a true music lover and that makes being included in THPS even more special.”While Pro Skater has gone down in legend, Less Than Jake believes that it could have very easily gone the other way.“How many stars do we know that have made products or endorsed things that weren’t good?” laughs DeMakes. “But in Tony’s case, he had a really cool game that kids embraced and loved.”“Pro Skater could have been a flop, it could have just not really worked out in the long run,” agrees Lima. “But every element of it was just super effortlessly cool and it was huge for us … I can’t count the amount of times someone has said: “I found out about you guys through Pro Skater.” Just look at the YouTube comments … thousands and thousands of fans that probably never would have heard of us otherwise.”Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 is out nowExplore more on these topicsGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Eleven women accused him of inappropriate sexual behaviour, such as groping and touching.Ina statement, the 60-year-old presenter said he had recently been diagnosed as autistic but TV bosses had failed to “investigate my disability” or “protect me from what I now realise was a dangerous environment”.The former greengrocer posted a statement on his Instagram page on Tuesday claiming he had been cleared of the “most serious and sensational accusations” against him.In response, a spokesperson for the National Autistic Society, said: “Every autistic person is different, just like every non-autistic person is different, so it is important not to generalise or make judgments based on the actions, words or behaviour of any one individual.”Some of the more recent claims include a MasterChef worker who said she tried to complain about comments she alleged Wallace made about her body in 2022, and a former police officer who said he tried to raise concerns after he allegedly witnessed Wallace making inappropriate sexual comments at a charity event in 2023.Other autism and disability charities and campaigners criticised Wallace’s comments.Jessie Hewitson, a director ofNeuroUniverse, a company that trains companies in supporting neurodiverse employees, who is autistic, said: “I don’t make the connection between this alleged behaviour and autism.“We support companies in supporting their neurodivergent employees. Common scenarios we encounter with autistic people are often they may say things in a direct way which offend colleagues.“For example, there might be heightened anxiety around something’s changed [at work]. And to other colleagues it can look like the autistic person is being very difficult, when, really, potentially, they’re just very stressed.“Those are the kind of common misunderstandings you encounter. We’ve never encountered someone coming to us saying they’ve got an autistic employee who’s behaved in a sort of sexually inappropriate way or has said sexually inappropriate things.”Hewitson said the law stated that employers had to support neurodivergent people, but that did not offer a “free pass” for bad behaviour.“It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take responsibility for it,” she said.“We’ve been terribly stereotyped since the dawn of time. Everyone considers us emotionless, weird robots, and we were totally dehumanised.“I feel like that stereotype is starting to go so I worry that this will create a conflation in some people’s minds between inappropriate workplace behaviour and autism.”Seema Flower, the founder of Blind Ambition, a disability training consultancy, said: “To use autism as an excuse to behave the way that he is alleged to have behaved is very, very poor.“This was over 20 years. If you do it once, you do it twice, then you’ve got a problem. You go and seek some advice and get some remedies and strategies in place.”Flower said it was “really damaging” to perceptions of autistic people. “It has great, negative ramifications,” she said.“Because the general public will think ‘that person’s got autism, they’re going to be likely to sexually assault me or abuse me or make inappropriate comments’.“People will be less likely to employ people with autism, they’re less likely to work with them. They’re less likely to to have any interaction with them sexually.”She added: “It’s also making a mockery of the whole diagnosis of autism. You’re saying that if someone’s got autism, are they going to get a free pass to inappropriately behave with women or men?”Explore more on these topicsGregg WallaceMasterChefAutismFood TVTelevisionBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

It also questioned the legitimacy of Moth’s diagnosis.On Wednesday, Winn published alengthy responsedenying many of the allegations, and shared medical letters discussing Moth’s CBD.In a statementreported by the Bookseller, the publisher said: “Given recent events, in particular intrusive conjecture around Moth’s health condition which has caused considerable distress to Raynor Winn and her family, it is our priority to support the author at this time”.“With this in mind, Penguin Michael Joseph, together with the author, have made the decision to delay the publication of On Winter Hill from this October. We will announce a new publication date in due course.”On Winter Hill would be Winn’s fourth book, after Landlines, The Wild Silence and her debut, The Salt Path, which has sold more than 2m copies globally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Winn also withdrew from the planned Saltlines tour, on which she was scheduled to appear alongside the Gigspanner Big Band at a number of UK venues. Refunds have been given to some customers,according to the BBC.The Observer accused Winn – whose real name is Sally Walker – of taking “around £64,000” from a former employer, among other allegations.

The sails will now rotate daily from 4pm to 2am.“The whole troupe is very happy to find our sails again – these are the sails of Paris,” said Cyrielle, one of the 60 dancers who took part in the street celebration, which was illuminated by a specially commissioned firework display.Founded in 1889, the Moulin Rouge became a global symbol offin-de-siècleParisian nightlife, its famed can-can dancers depicted in paintings by artists such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. An eponymous2001 film by Baz Luhrmanncemented its present-day appeal.The French can-can is believed to have evolved from the final figure of a dance for couples known as thequadrille.It caused considerable scandal when it first became popular as a cabaret act mainly because of its intentionally revealing high kicks.Performed by a line of female dancers, the dance, devised in the early 1920s by Pierre Sandrini, then artistic director of the Moulin Rouge, revolves around the “vigorous manipulation of skirts and petticoats, high kicks, jump splits and cartwheels”.After their collapse,new aluminium sailswere ready in time for the Paris Olympics last July, but it has taken almost a year to build and fit a new electric motor ready to turn them and power the hundreds of red and gold bulbs that stud the display.Explore more on these topicsParisCabaretFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Bullivant and Habib were not among the 13 identified by the group.In a statement to the Guardian, Bullivant called the accusations a “smear campaign”.In its letter, Great British Pac calls for an end to any negotiations to return the Parthenon sculptures, also known as the Elgin marbles, or risk legal challenges.The campaigners refer to what they allege is a “covert negotiation”, citing an “accelerating campaign to remove the Elgin marbles from the British Museum”.Experts in archaeology and antiquities criticised the intervention. Dan Hicks, a professor of contemporary archaeology at the University of Oxford, said: “The accusation of a covert and accelerating campaign appears to be aimed at publicly appointed trustees, whereas in reality it is the structure, funding and identity of Great British Pac that is opaque and concerning.“Perhaps the signatories could explain who and what exactly this group is and who is paying for it. This letter is a desperate culture-warrior exercise in scaremongering and intimidation developed by undefined political actors.”He added: “International loans have been a normal part of the operation of museum exhibitions for more than a century. To give just one example, the British Museum itself will be the recipient of a high-profile loan from France next year when theBayeux tapestry will be put on display. Many will question why the UK’s national museums remain unable to make permanent returns of stolen cultural objects on a case-by-case basis, as other British museums are able to do.“And some, myself included, have been asking why national museum directors and trustees are not calling for a change in those antiquated 1960s laws. But to call into question the legality of making loans from Britain to an EU nation would be very odd indeed.”Christos Tsirogiannis, who heads illicit antiquities trafficking research for theUnesco chair on threats to cultural heritageat the Ionian University in Corfu, said: “While it is completely unacceptable that the public in both countries remains in the dark about the content of the negotiations, it was reported years ago in the British press that the majority of the British public supports the unconditional and permanent return of all the Parthenon sculptures to Greece.View image in fullscreenHorse head from the collection of Parthenon marbles that once decorated the temple on the Acropolis in Athens.Photograph: mauritius images GmbH/Alamy“In reality, this letter harms the interests of the British people and state, and disrupts the relationship between two traditional allies, bound by friendship and blood ties in two world wars. Both governments – not just the trustees of the British Museum – bear equal responsibility for reaching a historically just solution.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were removed between 1801 and 1815 by Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman empire, who claimed he had permission to take them, although no supporting document has been found. The sculptures were acquired by the British Museum in 1816, but their rightful ownership has been disputed since the 1980s.Last year, two months after Labour’s election victory, Giorgos Gerapetritis, the Greek foreign minister, told the Guardian he believed a deal was “relatively close”. Negotiations between Athens and the British Museum began in 2021.It has been reported that any possible agreement might be underpinned by a cultural partnership between the countries, with the sculptures being returned and reunited with other pieces on display at the Parthenon galleries of the Acropolis Museum in exchange for renowned artworks that could take centre stage at rolling exhibitions in London.Bullivant, also the editor of the Conservative & Reformer Post website, said: “Hope not Hate’s smear campaign is nothing new. It’s part of their tired old playbook: when they can’t win the argument, they try to delegitimise those who disagree.“We’re not a political party, we don’t take orders from anyone, and we firmly believe in free speech.”She added: “As for funding – let’s clear that up too. Hope not Hate seem obsessed with it. We are 100% grassroots. No shadowy donors. No foreign money. It doesn’t take a bank transfer to write a letter about the Elgin Marbles. You want to know who paid for the stamp? I did.”A spokesperson for the British Museum said: “Discussions withGreeceabout a Parthenon partnership are ongoing and constructive.“We believe that this kind of long-term partnership would strike the right balance between sharing our greatest objects with audiences around the world, and maintaining the integrity of the incredible collection we hold at the museum.”Explore more on these topicsParthenon marblesBritish MuseumGreeceHeritageMuseumsSculptureLiz TrussnewsShareReuse this content"

McMahon’s remains have been cremated.McMahon’s cancer diagnosis was made public by his widow, Kelly, when she announced his death on 4 July. She said that he “died peacefully this week after a valiant effort to overcome cancer”.“Julian loved life,” she said. “He loved his family. He loved his friends. He loved his work, and he loved his fans. His deepest wish was to bring joy into as many lives as possible.”1:33Julian McMahon's most memorable roles – videoMany of McMahon’s peers reacted with shock at the news last week. His Charmed co-stars Alyssa Milano, Rose McGowan and Holly Marie Combs all paid tribute, with Milano writing that she was “heartbroken”, adding: “He was more than my TV husband. He was a dear friend.”Nicolas Cage, his co-star in The Surfer, remembered McMahon as a “kind and intelligent man”.McMahon, who also played the playboy plastic surgeon Dr Christian Troy in Nip/Tuck, was remembered by his co-stars Dylan Walsh and Joely Richardson.Richardson called the news “shocking”,writing on Instagram: “He just seemed bigger and stronger than the rest of us.”Julian McMahon’s death is a sad, dramatic end to a magnetic talent, whose star was on the rise again | Luke BuckmasterRead more“I can’t believe it,”she wrote. “We worked together for many years, covering every possible storyline and then some.

The track ends with a sample of a speech given by Adolf Hitler in 1935 in the original German, which ends with the Nazi leader calling for supporters to “stand up for me like I have stood up for you”.Kanye West barred from entering Australia over Hitler song, Tony Burke saysRead moreThe song was banned in Germany on the grounds of its extremist symbolism under hate speech laws and was removed from most mainstream streaming platforms, but proliferated and found support on Elon Musk’s X.In the wake of the announcement of West’s appearance at Rubicon,thousands of people signed a petition against the gig, calling it “an insult to historic memory, a glorification of wartime violence and debasement of all victims of the Nazi regime”.During the second world war, more than 70,000 Slovak Jews were put in concentration camps, turned over to German authorities and murdered.West – a vocal supporter of the US president, Donald Trump – is “repeatedly and openly adhering to symbols and ideology connected with the darkest period of modern global history”, two groups behind the petition said.In a statement on Instagram late on Wednesday, Rubicon organisers said the decision to cancel the event was “due to media pressure and the withdrawal of several artists and partners”.“This was not an easy decision,” they said, without drawing a direct line between the rapper’s planned appearance and the cancellations.Styling itself as the central European country’s premier hip-hop hang-out, the Rubicon festival was to run from 18 to 20 July. The US rappers Offset and Sheck Wes were to share top billing with West.This month it was revealed thatAustralia cancelled West’s visa over Heil Hitler, in which West raps about his custody battle with his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian.

It’s High School Musical, in essence, but with a vaguely supernatural bent. Previous instalments have introduced werewolves and aliens; this time, we get vampires. Featuring songs such as Don’t Mess With Us and Kerosene, it’s lightweight fluff, but highly enjoyable.SHExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightReality TVNoel EdmondsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As well as writing a Gospel, he found time to portray the Virgin Mary from life – a story that understandably fascinated artists because it gave them an excuse to depict themselves and their craft. Is this a self-portrait of Jacopo diCione? It doesn’t seem to show Luke painting Mary – that would become a speciality of 15th-century Flemish artists who loved depicting Luke’s studio in lifelike detail. Instead, here he has a book and pen. He may be writing his Gospel. But his keen gaze suggests he is drawing in ink, for sketching was a popular practice in medieval Florence where this was painted. Either way, in medieval thinking, he is not just depicting what he sees.

They’re surprisingly easy to make from scratch, too. The base is an incredibly light genoise sponge that’s topped with a layer of jelly, and it’s this section that allows for some creativity. I chose to go down a summery route with passion fruit. Juicing enough passion fruit to get 200ml of liquid is tedious (and expensive), so by all means use a carton of juice instead.Passion fruit jaffa cakesPrep5 minChill3 hr+Cook45 minMakes9For the jelly3½ sheets platinum-grade gelatine200mlpassion fruit juice, fresh or from a cartonFor the cakeButter, for greasing35g plain flour,plus extra for dusting1 large egg35g caster sugar¼ tsp salt75gdark chocolate, choppedStart by making the jelly. Put the gelatine in a small bowl of cold water and leave to soften for five minutes. Meanwhile, line a small, roughly 20cm x 15cm baking dish or tray with baking paper.Put the passion fruit juice in a saucepan, heat gently until steaming, then, before it comes to a boil, take off the heat. Squeeze out the excess water from the softened gelatine, add the sheets to the juice and stir to dissolve. Pour into the lined dish and chill in the fridge for three to four hours, until firmly set.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Lightly grease nine holes of a cupcake tray, then lightly dust them with flour.Put the egg and sugar in a bowl and use an electric whisk to whip until thick and fluffy. Sift on the flour and salt, then fold in gently, taking care not to knock out too much air. Spoon about a tablespoon of batter into each greased cupcake hole, then bake for 15 minutes, until golden and springy to the touch. Remove from the oven, leave to cool in the tin for a few minutes, then turn out the cakes.Use a cutter slightly smaller than the width of the cakes to stamp out nine discs of the set jelly, then place one on top of each cake.Melt the chocolate in short bursts in the microwave (or over a bain-marie), then leave to cool a little. Spoon a little chocolate on to each cake, nudging it around evenly, then leave to firm up before serving.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotBakingChocolateFruitCakeBiscuitsSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"

The lack of Campari means it’s much lighter than the dark red of the traditional negroni, while the rosé vermouth means it’s also more delicate, making this ideal for summer drinking. The much underusedSuzeis a French gentian aperitif bitter that complements the aromatics of rosé vermouth very nicely.

Prawns are my seafood of choice at home, and I lean into store-cupboard staples to bring together easy, quick meals for my small family. Today’s glorious noodle salad is perfect for summer, not least because it’s a simple assembly job, while the second recipe, if you make a little effort to devein some shell-on prawns, rewards you with the most magnificent plate of them that you’ll ever eat.Spicy glass noodle and prawn salad (pictured top)Kerabuis an umbrella term in Malay denoting a vibrant salad of vegetables and herbs, dressed with a fiery sambal, shrimp paste and lime to bring everything together. The dressing is spicy, sharp and smells wonderful from all the herbs. You might also findkerabunoodle salads. This is my very easy version, perfect for hot days, because it doesn’t involve any cooking. I’ve substituted tinned anchovies (use the best you can afford) for the shrimp paste to avoid having to toast the paste. Coincidentally, when I blitzed up the first test of this dressing, it smelled very much likecincalok, another Malaysian speciality of fermented krill mixed with shallots and chillies. A traditional kerabusalad will always include laksa leaves (AKA hot mint), but these are tricky to find in the UK, so I have used a mixture of herbs more commonly found in British supermarkets, not least because I find that the basil goes a little way towards the fragrant pepperiness of hot mint.Prep25 minSoak10 minServes4-6For the dressing2 fresh red chillies, seeds and all, stalks discarded, flesh finely chopped1 banana shallot, peeled and roughly chopped4 fresh makrut lime leaves, stems removed50gtin anchovy fillets, not drainedJuice of ½-1 lime, to taste1 tbsp dark brown sugar3 tbspchilli sauce(I make my own tomato sambal (see recipe below), but I also likeMaggi’s garlic chilli sauceor sriracha), plus extra to serve1 tbsp fish sauce1 tsp tamarind paste, or Worcestershire sauce (I useLea & Perrins)3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilFor the salad150g mung bean glass noodles, or rice vermicelli noodles, soaked in just-boiled water for at least 10 minutes30gbunch fresh basil(Thai, holy or regular), leaves picked30gbunch fresh mint, leaves picked and roughly chopped30gbunchfresh coriander, roughly chopped, stems and all300gcooked and peeled small cold-water prawns(defrosted if frozen, and any excess water gently squeezed out)¾ cucumber, deseeded and cut into 1cm cubesPut all the dressing ingredients in a small food processor and blitz to a smooth puree.Drain the soaked noodles and put them in a large bowl. Roughly tear the basil leaves into the noodles.At least 15 minutes before you want to serve, to give all the flavours a chance to come together, put all the remaining ingredients and the dressing into the noodle bowl, mix thoroughly and set aside. That said, if you’re making this well in advance, don’t add the cucumber until 15 minutes before serving, because it releases water after a while, which will make for a very wet salad. Serve with extra sambal or chilli sauce on the side.Tomato sambalView image in fullscreenMandy Yin’s homemade tomato sambal.This brilliant sambal is a perfect balance of spicy, sweet and tangy, and I’ll take it any day over sriracha and even my beloved Maggi garlic chilli sauce. The best thing is that it comes together extremely easily and quickly, and keeps for months in the fridge.Prep5 minCook15 minMakes300g150gfresh red chillies, stalks discarded, flesh roughly chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped60mlvegetable oil3 tbsp tomato puree1½ tsp table salt4½ tbsp dark brown sugarUsing a stick blender or a high-speed blender, blitz the chillies, garlic and oil to a fine puree. Put a small, nonstick saucepan on a medium heat, add the chilli-garlic mixture and stir-fry for 10 minutes; if it starts to splutter too much, turn down the heat a little. Add the tomato puree, salt, sugar and 80ml water, stir-fry for two minutes, just to dissolve everything, then take off the heat and leave to cool. Once cool, decant into a sterilised jar, seal and store in the fridge.Greg’s spicy fried prawnsView image in fullscreenDaddy’s girl: Mandy Yin’s spicy fried prawns are inspired by her father.This is an excellent dish from my dad’s repertoire. It is based on a dish he used to have as a child in a Chinese restaurant in Malacca. We know it ashar lokfried prawns. Yes, it’s a bit fiddly, because it requires you todeveinshell-on prawns, but that’s just about the only real work involved. Frozen, whole, raw jumbo prawns from the supermarket freezer aisle are generally cheaper than fresh ones, so by all means use them instead. The magic of the prawn-infused sauce comes from thetomalleyreleased from the prawn heads and shells.Prep5 minCook30 minServes41kglarge shell-onprawns, defrosted if using frozen4 tbsp vegetable oil2 fresh red chillies, finely sliced4 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced3 tbsp light soy sauce110gketchup– I use Heinz¼ tsp chilli powderDevein the prawns by sticking a toothpick through the second shell joint from the tail and pulling up through the flesh. The vein will become loose, so all you have to do then is to pull out the rest of it. Use scissors to trim off each prawn’s two long feelers and snip off the very sharp end of the prawn’s head.Put the oil in a large nonstick wok on a high heat. Add the chillies and half the spring onions, stir-fry for a minute, then add the prawns and stir-fry for five or so minutes, until nearly all the shells have turned bright pink – leave the wok alone for 20 seconds at a time between stirring, so the prawns cook through.Add the soy sauce, ketchup and chilli powder, and stir-fry for a further two minutes, until the sauce thickens. Spoon on to a platter, garnish with the remaining spring onions and eat immediately.These recipes are edited extracts from Simply Malaysian: Everyday Dishes to Cook at Home, by Mandy Yin, published later this month by Quadrille at £27.

It came as a response to what Pret said was a “shift in what customers want from lunch”, though possibly not from their wallet, with the premium salads priced £10-£13.But how good are they? And is it right that they cost that much? I set off to recreate the miso salmon super plate at home. It’s fun copying the ingredients off the back of a packet to come up with a recipe. With the miso salmon plate, I’m impressed by the original: the plate looks very pretty, and the lightly smoked salmon fillet has an excellent texture. The tenderstem broccoli is just-blanched, and pleasingly crunchy.It’s only when I compare the miso-orange dressing with my own version that I realise quite how much sugar must have gone in – ditto the chilli aubergine, which is a bit gloopy (thanks, cornflour). But it’s a generous dish, and with a triple hit of protein from the salmon, soya beans and quinoa, I have none of my usual sugar/chocolate cravings in the afternoon.Pret a Manger launches salad revamp – and one starts at £12.95Read moreBased on the texture of the Pret aubergine, I treated it like the Korean side-dish gaji-namul – steaming the aubergine before stirring through the dressing (minus the cornflour). The homemade dish is very close in taste, but overall my dish tastes punchier, because I used freshly grated ginger and garlic throughout, rather than pastes.The significant difference is the cost: Pret’s salad comes in at £12.95, while my homemade one comes in at about £8.14 a person, after factoring in the proportion of each packet or jar used (I got most of it from Sainsbury’s and the more unusual or less widely available ingredients from Sous Chef). But if you haven’t already got shichimi togarashi, gochugaru (red pepper flakes) or aonori seaweed in your cupboard, then you’re setting yourself back £11.65 just on “store-cupboard ingredients” you might never use again. So £8-ish, plus an initial outlay of £12 to recreate this at home, which is more than a bit steep.The clincher? I’m not the kind of home cook or food writer who ever, ever wants you to have to use two pans, a steamer, two sieves, three bowls and a baking tray to make a single dish. You might not mind several processes and more than an hour hands-on time for a recipe, butIreallydo.Ultimately, I’d say the Pret salad is worth £12.95, because there’s no outlay on expensive store-cupboard ingredients and, given its quality (it’s fresher than comparable on the go post-workout meals). And it’d certainly save me £3-£4 on cake/cookies/ice-cream in the afternoon.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Publicity imageHow to make amisosalmonsuper plate at homePrepInterminableCook20 minCost£8.14a portionServes22 lightly smoked salmon fillets2 teaspoons mixed seeds2 teaspoons shichimi togarashi½ teaspoon aonori seaweed½ teaspoon sea salt flakes½ tablespoon rapeseed oil50g mixed black & white quinoa½ aubergine, sliced lengthways and cut into 1cm quarter moons1 clove garlic, peeled and grated2 tsp gochugaru (red pepper powder)¼ tsp chilli powder20ml rapeseed oil5ml brown rice vinegar½ tsp sugar½ tsp sea salt flakes6 stemstenderstem broccoli4 heaped tbsp edamame beans2 handfuls mixed salad leaves1 ripe avocado, finely sliced and dressed with a little lemon juice15ml rapeseed oil15g miso paste (I used red)10ml brown rice vinegar½ tsp finely grated ginger½ tsp finely grated garlic½ tsp sugarPinch chilli powderPinch sea salt flakes½ lime, cut into quarters to serveskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

It’s easy to make, and not far off from a focaccia – light, fluffy and ideal for a summer lunch in the garden.The topping is elevated by using quality ingredients from the Tesco Finest range. For me, that includes tender marinated violetta artichokes, creamy mozzarella di bufala and exotic mixed mushrooms, including shiitake, oyster and other varieties for a rich flavour and texture.Prep30 min (plus 2 hr 45 min proving time)Cook50 minServes6For the topping2 tbsp Tesco Finest Sicilian extra virgin olive oil,plus a little extra to drizzle450g Tesco Finest exotic mixed mushrooms, larger mushrooms halved2 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced2 tbsp fresh thyme140g Tesco Finest Italian violetta artichokes, halved2 balls Tesco Finest mozzarella di bufala Campana, drained and torn70g mascarpone20g Tesco Finest parmigiano reggiano, grated (optional)For the base500g Tesco Finest ‘00’ grade pasta and pizza flour1 sachet fast action yeast1 tsp salt1 tsp sugar4 tbsp Tesco Finest Sicilian extra virgin olive oil350ml tepid waterTo servePeppery salad leavesSuggested wine pairingTesco Finest Central Otago pinot noirShop buttonView image in fullscreenTip the flour into a large mixing bowl. Add the yeast, salt and sugar, and mix together. Make a well in the centre for the oil and water. Mix until you have a dough then knead in a stand mixer for 5 minutes, or knead by hand on a well-floured surface for 7 minutes. Form the dough into a ball and place in an oiled bowl, cover and set aside at room temperature for about 2 hours or until doubled in size.Oil a large lipped baking tray and line with baking paper. Roll out the dough and fit snugly into the tray. Leave to rise again in a warm place for 30 minutes.To create a “pizza stone”, place a second baking tray, overturned, on the top shelf of the oven and put the heat on to full power.Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in a large pan. Batch fry the mushrooms over a medium heat for 7-10 minutes, or until they start to brown. Add the garlic, 1 tbsp of thyme and cook for 3 minutes. Set aside to cool. Mix the mascarpone in a bowl with a little salt.Drizzle a little extra oil on to the dough and dimple all over with your hands. Top with the mushrooms, mozzarella, artichokes, dollops of mascarpone, the remaining thyme and the parmesan, if using. Rest for 15 minutes.Place the tray containing the dough on top of the “pizza stone” in the oven and turn down to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Bake for 40 minutes until golden and risen.Slide on to a board and slice into six. Serve with a well-dressed peppery salad.Shop the ingredients for this recipe onTesco.comand discover how Tesco Finest can make your everyday taste betterExplore more on these topicsCook Up A Feast With Tesco Finestadvertisement featuresShareReuse this content"
