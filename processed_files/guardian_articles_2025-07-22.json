His childhood had been troubled – he struggled at school, partly as a result of dyslexia, and suffered sexual abuse at the hands of two older bullies – and his prospects after leaving school aged 15 seemed non-existent. Even his attempts to become a criminal ended in farce. He was, he later noted, “fucking useless” as a burglar: a television he was attempting to steal fell on top of him; operating in the dark, he inadvertently stole a selection of baby clothes rather than the adult garments he had intended to sell around the pubs of his native Aston in Birmingham. Finally, he was caught and sent to prison for six weeks.“OZZY ZIG NEEDS A GIG” read the card he left in the window of a local music shop, and “need” seems to have been the operative word: by the time he joined a heavy blues rock band called Earth as vocalist, he was out of other options. It wasn’t even as if Earth, or Black Sabbath as they became, offered an obvious ticket to fame and fortune: their big idea to advance their career involved loading their van up with equipment, then driving it to other artists’ gigs uninvited, sitting outside on the off-chance that one of the bands performing pulled out and they could fill in.And when Osbourne opened his mouth to sing, you didn’t need to know about his dismal CV to realise life hadn’t dealt him a great hand. His voice was a desolate, unschooled wail, best suited to delivering songs that fitted the definition of rock’n’roll once offered by Dr Feelgood’s late frontman Lee Brilleaux: “Music about sod’s law and bad luck.”The creation myth of Black Sabbath – and therefore of heavy metal, the genre they more or less invented singlehanded – is that it was a brilliantly canny piece of branding on the part of drummer Bill Ward: if people queued up to see horror films, why not create a rock equivalent? Black Sabbath certainly arrived fully formed – every one of the musical elements that made them legendary is perfectly in place on the eponymous opening track of their eponymous 1970 debut album – but the music they came up with in response to Ward’s idea felt organic, not calculated. Black Sabbath sounded like a product of their environment: a grim, provincial, industrial world, where the drugs associated with the hippy counterculture had arrived, but not the freedoms or opportunities enjoyed by London’s bohemian elite. And they sounded like a product of their era. If one response to the end of the 60s party was to be found in the wistful, delicate morning-after melancholy of 1970’s biggest-selling album, Simon and Garfunkel’s Bridge Over Troubled Water, then Black Sabbath provided another: music that seemed as if it was lumbering angrily around with the kind of monstrous hangover that feels more like a nervous breakdown, suffused with dark thoughts, alienation, self-hatred and paranoia.Their debut still carried hints of the heavy blues band they had been – side two in particular sounds like a kind of curdled Cream – but by the time of 1970’s Paranoid, they had honed their style into something entirely unique. It was hugely successful – quadruple platinum in the US – but, as with every early Black Sabbath album, critically reviled in a way that now seems scarcely believable: “The worst of the counterculture on a plastic platter … bullshit … dull and decadent … dim-witted, amoral exploitation,” opined American writer Robert Christgau of the band. Their reception set the tone for the way heavy metal as a genre would be dismissed by “serious” rock critics for decades to come, but there was a curious sense in which it worked in Sabbath’s favour, turning them into the people’s band, who connected with a vast audience of disaffected teenagers (“the kid down the block … slumped in his bedroom gorged on Tuinal … finding justification for his cancerous apathy,” as one contemporary writer characterised their fans) without the aid of the media.3:27Ozzy Osbourne, icon of British heavy metal, dies aged 76 – video obituaryOsbourne bolstered that image himself. For all the dark mythology that surrounded the band – they seem to have spent a significant portion of the early 70s explaining to journalists that they weren’t actually satanists – he cut a curiously unstudied figure on stage. Watch the YouTube footage of the band performing at the California Jam festival in April 1974 and what’s striking is the disparity between the way they sound – monstrously heavy and dark – and the way Osbourne looks. No moody scowling or sullen posturing: he strips his shirt off, jumps up and down excitedly, claps along, raises his hands to the sky and waves his arms in delight. He behaves remarkably like a member of the audience who’s been allowed on stage and can’t quite believe his luck: in an era of rarefied rock gods preening, here was a rock star whose every move suggested he was just like you.View image in fullscreen‘A rock star whose every move suggested he was just like you’ … Osbourne performing at Lewisham Odeon, London, May 1978.Photograph: Gus Stewart/Getty ImagesThe California Jam footage arguably captures Black Sabbath at their peak. The following year, Sabotage brought to an end a run of virtually flawless albums: Paranoid, Master of Reality, Vol 4, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Osbourne considered leaving the band during the recording of 1976’s Technical Ecstasy, a confused attempt to expand their sound in the face of a changing musical climate – he toyed with starting a new band called Blizzard of Ozz – but instead found himself fired after the release of its underwhelming follow-up Never Say Die! His bandmates blamed drink and drug-related unreliability, Osbourne insisted that he was no more indulgent than the others. Whatever the truth, even Osbourne himself seemed to regard his sacking as the end of his musical career: he holed up in an LA hotel room, apparently intent on spending his severance pay on alcohol and drugs in the belief that “after this I’m going back to Birmingham and the dole”.He reckoned without the intervention of the formidable Sharon Levy, sent to LA by her father, Black Sabbath’s manager Don, to keep an eye on the singer. The pair not only became romantically involved, marrying in 1982, they proceeded to pull off a dramatic reinvention of Osbourne’s career, hinging on a happy accident and an inspired idea.View image in fullscreenCartoonish Prince of Darkness … Ozzy Osborne with a parakeet in his Beverly Hills home in March 1997.Photograph: Eddie Sanderson/Getty ImagesThe happy accident was Osbourne stumbling across a virtually unknown guitarist called Randy Rhoads. In Rhoads’ retelling of the story, Osbourne was so drunk at his audition that he hired him after only hearing him tune up. The inspired idea was to embrace the kind of negative attention that Black Sabbath had always attempted to dismiss. By the early 80s, heavy metal was a hugely successful musical genre. As its stock rose, so did the attention paid to the kind of lyrical themes that Black Sabbath had once specialised in. In the US in particular, rightwing conservatives and Christian fundamentalists created a mini-industry in taking self-evidently preposterous metal lyrics at face value and detecting inferences that were clearly completely unintentional. If heavy metal was now deemed an authentic threat to public morality rather than escapist entertainment, was Osbourne and Arden’s thinking, then the genre’s co-creator should be an embodiment of outrage.Out went the excitable frontman who was just like you. In cameOzzy Osbourne, cartoonish Prince of Darkness, who bit the head off a dove during a record company sales convention, then repeated the trick on stage in Des Moines, Iowa, this time with a live bat; took all his clothes off and dipped his testicles in a glass of wine at a dinner with his German label bosses; and urinated on the Alamo Cenotaph.It wasn’t entirely clear whether Osbourne himself was working to some brilliant self-publicising masterplan or just a raging alcoholic doing ridiculous things because he was pissed, but either way, the attendant controversy sent his popularity skyward, helped by the fact that his first two solo albums, 1980’s Blizzard of Ozz and 1981’s Diary of a Madman, were infinitely better records than anyone who had encountered Osbourne towards the end of his tenure with Sabbath would have believed he was capable of making. His voice was apparently unaffected by the abuse he visited upon his body. Rhoads was a lavishly gifted guitarist, his classical training – most obvious on Diary of a Madman’s title track – shifting his playing away from the blues-based style that had dominated hard rock in the 70s, presaging the way heavy metal would move in the 80s. The songs they came up with were more varied than the cartoon imagery would suggest: the most obvious influence on Goodbye to Romance was Osbourne’s beloved Beatles in their psychedelic prime.The albums and the outrage made Osbourne so famous as a solo star, he seemed weirdly impregnable. Nothing, it appeared, could dent his success. Not the death of Rhoads in a 1982 plane crash, nor the noticeable decline in quality of Osbourne’s albums – 1982’s pointless collection of re-recorded Black Sabbath songs Speak of the Devil, the full-bore glam metal of 1983’s Bark at the Moon – nor his increasing addiction problems. He sounded rejuvenated by the arrival of guitarist Zakk Wylde on 1988’s No Rest for the Wicked and 1991’s No More Tears, but in between was arrested for attempted murder after strangling his wife, Sharon, during a drink and drug binge.He subsequently emerged from rehab – his marriage, incredibly, still intact – but remained an uneven recording artist for the rest of his life. Genuinely great albums – including 2001’s underrated Down to Earth, reunited with Wylde and with a pre-Metallica Robert Trujillo on bass – shared space in his discography with wan efforts such as 1995’s hopelessly overproduced Ozzmosis, and stuff that lurked somewhere inbetween, a category in which you might reasonably place Black Sabbath’s Rick Rubin-produced reunion album 13. You could never have accused Osbourne of shying away from the unexpected, whether it was experimenting with Auto-Tune on 2022’s Patient Number 9, or offering up a remarkably faithful version of John Lennon’s distinctly soppy Woman on 2005’s Under Cover. Again, the mixed quality of his output did nothing to affect his standing. His celebrity was boosted by reality show The Osbournes, which elevated him to national treasure status, something it was hard to imagine happening in the years when his audience was held to be Tuinal-gorged losers scarred by the cancer of apathy. And perhaps more importantly, under Sharon Osbourne’s aegis, he fully embraced his Godfather ofMetaltag, presiding over the scores of younger artists who appeared at his annual Ozzfest tours – and, finally, his poignant farewell with the all-star Back to the Beginning concert, just three weeks ago. The sheer number of artists who turned out to pay homage in Villa Park was astonishing: it said everything about the regard in which the band and its frontman were held by the metal community.However much heavy metal has changed and developed over the last 56 years, it’s very difficult to imagine how it might have turned out had Black Sabbath not existed. Every artist who chose to work in the genre thereafter – and indeed umpteen artists that didn’t – carries something of Black Sabbath in their DNA, and one suspects they always will. It’s equally hard to imagine Black Sabbath making anything like the impact they did without Ozzy Osbourne. “I always thought that whatever I had was temporary,” he wrote in his autobiography I Am Ozzy, a line that perhaps harks back to his desperate pre-Sabbath early years. The exact opposite proved to be true.Explore more on these topicsOzzy OsbourneMetalPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

Amid the indefatigable rise of movies cynically re-spun for the stage, this musical adaptation of the 2010 film featuring Cher andChristina Aguileragoes its own eccentric way. With its monster sound, energy and blinding bling, it is no less than Burlesque 2.0.The original Burlesque brought together Cher’s stadium-sized voice and Aguilera’s “mutant lungs” (to quote a line from the film). Which duo can compare to that? This one, it turns out. You could generate electricity with the combined sound of Orfeh, as burlesque club owner Tess, and Jess Folley as Ali, a small-town singer with a big voice. Ali still blows the roof off this burlesque lounge but the musical is grittier and less sanitised.View image in fullscreenWow factor … Jess Folley in Burlesque.Photograph: Pamela RaithThe film revolved around Ali’s hunger for fame, with a subplot of financial ruin around the club akin to that in Moulin Rouge. Ali is now a too-loud gospel singer (“Beyoncé trapped in a Taylor Swift body”) who goes to New York not looking for fame but a long-lost mother. So many of the plotlines turn new, unexpected corners.With music composed by Aguilera, Sia, Todrick Hall, and Jess Folley, it keeps old songs such as the signature tune Show Me How You Burlesque and Something’s Got a Hold on Me and adds fabulous new numbers, big and fizzing and hugely witty, including the rap-infused Call Mama Daddy and the jazzy Ammo.The biggest surprise is that this reworking is done by Steven Antin, the film’s original writer and director. His musical underworld is not nearly as dark as Bob Fosse’s but not saccharine either, and far raunchier and more outre than the film. Antin’s script is so contemporary that it referencesBaby Reindeerand contains a show-stopping joke about theColdplay concert’s kiss-cam couple. The humour seems peculiarly British in spite of the American accents.Todrick Hall’s choreography is a sensation, with jaw-dropping athleticism, balletic moves and circus acrobatics, while Marco Marco’s “more is more” costumes deserve an award. Hall, also the show’s director, is an absolute blast as a performer. He doubles up as Ali’s old gospel teacher and Tess’s right-hand man at the lounge, blowing Stanley Tucci’s benign gay best friend of the film out of the water.Ali’s slow-burn romance with Jackson (Paul Jacob French) is cute when it could grate, with French providing a fantastically funny number in Natalie, in which he dumps his ever-absent ex-girlfriend by phone. The song seems coyly to poke fun at the earnestness of the film – an endearing send-up. The show as a whole bares it artifice every now and again, but without indulging in knowingness.View image in fullscreenFierce … Orfeh as Tess in Burlesque.Photograph: Pamela RaithAsha Parker-Wallace, as Ali’s rival Nikki, makes her professional debut with an almighty voice while Tess’s ex-husband Vince (George Maguire) is now a conniving Brit (less panto villain, more Hamilton’s King George III). And where Cher was a kindly fairy godmother type, Tess is a hard nut with fierce energy and a vague resemblance to Michelle Visage.The whole thing is very RuPaul. There is no lip-syncing, as in the film, but enough leather, feathers, sequins and disco ball lighting for a season of Drag Race. Plus harnesses, thongs and bared, bouncing flesh, too. Jake Dupree, as the gender fluid Trey/Chardonnay, is phenomenal, complete with nipple tassels in one striptease, while Alessia McDermott and Jess Qualter, as the kinky twins Summer and Spring, bring more of the burlesque spirit.It is over-adrenalised and messy in its plotting, but you forgive the blips. This is a production stuffed with personality, spectacle and wow factor. Come for the nostalgia, perhaps, but stay for the new kicks: bigger, naughtier and camp as hell.AtSavoy theatre, London, until 6 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsMusicalsTheatreChristina AguileraWest EndDancereviewsShareReuse this content"

The past 12 months have not been kind toJames Cleverly. A man who was used to being the most important person in almost every room he entered. Not so much these days. It was bad enough when the Tories were heavily defeated in the last election. Even Jimmy Dimly had seen that one coming. But the final straw had been the inability of his own supporters to count. Come the leadership election, his campaign team had accidentally voted him into third place in a failed bid to undermine Kemi Badenoch. Out of the race before it had even really got going.Old habits had died hard for Jimmy. Turning left on to every aircraft he boarded, only for an embarrassed steward to glance at his boarding pass and redirect him to economy. Automatically getting into the back seat of every car and wondering why it wasn’t going anywhere. It still took him a while to notice that he no longer had a driver. Doomed to get caught in traffic like the little people. The red box that he had kept as a souvenir now used only to house the shopping list he had been given.It was the emptiness he found hardest. The sheer grind of being a nobody. When Dimly had been a cabinet minister he had had a whole army of staff to keep the show on the road. Every day he would be up by 7am, ready to be briefed on what to say and do. His time had never truly been his own. And he had loved it when people deferred to him. “Yes foreign secretary. No home secretary.” Nor did the knighthood he had been given as a thanks, but no thanks – the inevitable reward for mid-ranking politician – make up for it. He felt as hollow as the title sounded.Now the alarm still went off early, but there was nothing to get him out of bed. It was no longer his voice that boomed in the prestigious 8.10am slot on the Today programme. He couldn’t even get a shoutout in the graveyard slots granted to shadow ministers. Instead he had to listen to halfwits – to be kind: quarterwits more accurately – such as Chris Philp and Priti Patel embarrass themselves. And all he could do was howl at the radio. It should have been him.Except it wasn’t. And that had been his decision. When his leadership hopes had crashed and burned, he had tried his hand at being a grandee. The voice of wisdom from the backbenches. Too important to be one of Kemi’s shadow cabinet stooges. Arm’s length from the stench of her inevitable failure. Just biding his time until someone tapped him on the shoulder. ‘Your time has come, Sir Jim Dim. The Tory party needs a new leader.’But the waiting had been a killer for him. Nothing to do but go in to Westminster and be ignored. He had tried inviting himself to endless lunches with journalists. To keep his flame alive. To remind himself of his own existence. That he mattered. Time was when it had been him who had to get away first. Important matters of state. Now it was the hacks who kept looking at their watches. Then he had tried making speeches. Not just speeches, but keynote speeches. Only there had never been a keynote. Just an audience often measured in single figures. Hacks waiting for a news line that never came.So Dimly had chosen to cut his losses. Why hang around hoping for another shot as leader when the Tory party was doomed for the foreseeable? Better to be a half-person on the inside than a nobody on the out. So he had let it be known he would consider a post in the shadow cabinet. And now that moment had come. He could feel the relief coursing through his veins. OK, it wasn’t shadow foreign or home secretary. Roles he vaguely understood. Butshadow housing secretary would do. He couldn’t be worse than the last person. He would have to check with the whips to find who that was. Jimmy Dimly was back in business.As one quasar flickered, another was born. The Word of Nigel made Flesh.Nigel Faragehas always traded in fantasies. A World as he would like it to be. Reality scares him to death. Because with reality comes responsibility. Sometimes. Nige has yet to take the credit for Brexit and its economic and social consequences. In fact he gets very narked when people try to remind him of the part he played. Everything is always someone else’s fault.But now Nigel has a son and heir. Step forward, George Finch, the new leader of Warwickshire county council. A slightly awkward, not very bright 19-year-old boy who looks like an intern on work experience. Which is pretty much what he is. A boy who is in charge of £1.5bn of council assets and with a spending budget of £500m. You couldn’t make this kind of thing up.So Warwickshire council is now a laboratory experiment. A place where we get to see what Reform policies look like in action. It’s also a place of high comedy. Soon to be sent to the Edinburgh fringe. I say policies, but the Reform councillors are outraged if anyone accuses them of having a plan of action for the county. Shortly before Tuesday’s vote for a new council leader, one of the Reform councillors made a point of saying he was proud to have no policies at all.The actual vote lasted three rounds as the Greens and theConservativeswere knocked out. The Greens had brought in a copy of Lord of the Rings and a model of the Titanic as props. The final count between Reform and the Lib Dens was tied on 23 apiece with eight abstentions. The casting vote went to the council chair, Edward Harris. “This is very difficult,” he said. It really wasn’t. Harris is a Reform councillor and had already voted for Finch.And guess what? Finch’s first move as leader was to propose a £150K handout for Reform to avail themselves of four special advisers. You couldn’t make this up. So much for the party of the anti-establishment. Next Finch and some other Reform councillors tried to persuade the council to vote against climate change. It wasn’t real, said Councillor Waine. Finch was adamant that climate change couldn’t exist because people in Reform had told him so. He didn’t seem to realise Reform may be the biggest party but they are still a minority. Maybe George will learn to count when he goes back to school.

I wouldn’t call it shame. I wasn’t sure if it was right or wrong. I wasn’t sure if it was something I could share with other people.”It is curious to hear these words spoken at the outset of a disarmingly sweet documentary. What kind of perversion, or even crime, is twentysomething Michaud confessing to in his own living room? A glimpse behind him provides a clue to his obsession and anxiety: displayed on a table is a collection of toy locomotives and model railway books. And the centrepiece is a model of Thomas the Tank Engine.I was still asking for Thomas toys on my 10th birthday. My parents thought it was weirdIn one of his letters to the Corinthians, St Paul wrote that when he became a man he put away childish things. Brannon Carty’s documentary, called An Unlikely Fandom: The Impact of Thomas the Tank Engine, is a rebuke to that philosophy. It celebrates the men (and the fans Carty interviews are overwhelmingly male) who have found friendship, community and creativity in what, as far as I can judge, is the most wholesome of subcultures.Yet a sense of shame pervades Thomas the Tank Engine fandom. “Aside from a handful of people,” says Carty, “no one’s really out and proud about it – because it’s socially unacceptable, especially here in the States.” Why? “I think Thomas gets looped in with Sesame Street and other preschool TV shows over here, whereas in the UK it’s seen more as a children’s show.”View image in fullscreen‘Honest and sincere’ … devotees in Carty’s film.Photograph: Requiem PicturesSuch nuances of a multiplatform global brand – whose merchandising spans pasta shapes and duvet covers, and whose fans number devotees in Japan and Australia – were not, you would think, on the mind of Reverend Wilbert Vere Awdry in 1943. It was then that Thomas was born, on a fictional island called Sodor.Awdry’s son Christopher needed cheering up from measles. And the reverend thought his tales of anthropomorphised steam locomotives, operating on the Fat Controller’s North Western Railway, would be just the ticket. Two years later, the first illustrated books appeared, colourful antidotes to postwar austerity Britain.When I was a child, in the 1960s and 70s, I borrowed the illustrated adventures of Thomas and his pals from my local library. For later generations, though, Thomas means something else. His name evokes nostalgia not for the books but for all the TV series, in particular Thomas & Friends, which first aired in 1984 in the UK, written by the late Britt Allcroft and narrated first by Ringo Starr, then later by Michael Angelis and others including, in one spinoff, the silken-voiced ex-007 Pierce Brosnan.Many of the twenty- and thirtysomething Thomas fans whom Carty interviews, and Carty himself, watched these shows as kids, and nostalgia for the plucky locomotive has haunted them into adulthood. Carty and his older brother watched the show as preschoolers in North Carolina, and would play with Thomas toys, but then their paths diverged. “He lost interest,” says Carty. “I didn’t.” Why? “I can’t explain it. My parents can’t explain it. They thought it was weird. I remember my 10th birthday: I was still asking for Thomas toys. I don’t know – it just clung to me like a disease. I’m happy that it clung to me, though. Now I’m a year shy of 30 and it’s still my thing.”What’s the appeal of Thomas in the US? “You don’t see a lot of steam engines over here. People see the Thomas engines and think, ‘Well those are just made up. Those aren’t real.’”View image in fullscreenA pick-me-up for a boy with measles … Thomas’s creator, the Rev W Awdry.Photograph: Requiem PicturesAs US versions of the TV series started appearing in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Thomas got a makeover. The Fat Controller became Mr Controller. After Starr’s stint as narrator ended, he was replaced in the US first by countercultural comedian George Carlin, and then by Alec Baldwin.How did An Unlikely Fandom come about? “I was studying film at the University of Northern Carolina,” says Carty. “My professor said, ‘Just go shoot a documentary. I don’t care how long it is. Just find something you care about.’ So I decided to film the adult Thomas fans who I knew. I made that film and graduated – then I realised there’s a bunch of fans in the UK that needed to be in this. A ton in Australia. A whole scene in Japan.”The fact that many of the interviewees are in their 20s and 30s suggests that much of the TV shows’ enduring appeal lies in nostalgia for childhoods dating from when the shows were first broadcast. But there’s more to it than that. Thomas has long held an appeal for people with autism. Indeeda 2001 survey foundthat children with autism and Asperger syndrome enjoy and identify with Thomas more than any other children’s character. Why? Respondents cited Thomas & Friends’ straightforward stories, overt narrative resolution, bold colours and clear facial features.View image in fullscreenHe’s got a ticket to ride … Thomas & Friends narrator Ringo Starr.Photograph: DMI/The LIFE Picture Collection/ShutterstockThat said, anyone really can identify with the scamp. For example, in Down the Mine, Thomas gets his comeuppance after teasing Gordon the big engine for smelling of ditchwater after an unfortunate incident. When Thomas later tumbles into a mine, he is rescued by Gordon, who indulges in no tit-for-tat sneering whatsoever. Thomas learns two lessons: don’t ignore warning signs and don’t be a jerk to your mates.Carty sometimes struggled to get interviewees to appear in his film. “A handful were nervous about being on screen and having their identity out there. I said, ‘Trust me. No one’s going to look stupid. This is going to be very honest, but it’s also going to be sincere. So as long as you are honest and sincere, the film will reflect that.’”An Unlikely Fandom does more than that: we watch devotees expressing themselves articulately, detailing how they learned film-making, or other creative pursuits, through fashioning fan fictions. Matt Michaud recalls how he took a video class at school and, inspired by a teacher to make his own movie, went home, got out his Thomas toys, put up a sheet for a backdrop, assembled rudimentary lighting and made his debut film. “That summer,” he says, “I made 13 episodes and started to build a following on YouTube.”Indeed, the life expectancy of Thomas has been extended by two things Awdry could never have foreseen. Without the internet, forums instantly connecting fans worldwide might not have existed; and without YouTube, the rich world of fan films – such as Carty’s own 2012 short Snow Trouble – might not have been seen so widely. “I don’t think that happens as much with other cartoon characters. I’m sure there are Star Wars fans who make fan films, but I don’t think Bob the Builder or Fireman Sam fans do.”Carty’s next project could not be more different. “It’s about these Italians who came to Florida in the 1990s and made Jaws 5.” That’s its unofficial title: Bruno Mattei’s film is also known as Cruel Jaws. “They wound up getting sued and their film was banned in the US. It spoke to me because Jaws and Thomas are my childhood.” Why was it banned? “They stole footage from the first three Jaws movies and the main theme is lifted from Star Wars. It’s horrible, but I love it. It’s cheesy and streaming free everywhere. I would recommend it.”Before he finishes that documentary, provisionally entitled Twilight Jaws, Carty will next month attend the UK premiere of An Unlikely Fandom. Much of the film’s sweetness comes from Carty’s footage of fans at conventions, making podcasts or – having been initiated into the world of steam railways through Thomas and his friends – working happily with like-minded souls as volunteers on narrow gauge heritage railways.What I most enjoyed about his film is the complete lack of snarkiness about grownups who are essentially playing with toys. “That was just the thing I wanted to get out to the world. I faced a lot of hardship for it. Other people faced a lot of hardship for it. Even fans gave other fans a hard time. They didn’t know how to process it, right? A lot of people said to me, ‘I wish I had this film when I was growing up because I would have realised I was not alone.’ When you’re growing up, parents are like, ‘Why aren’t you making friends? You need to find your crowd.’ A lot of Thomas fans did just that in later life. It’s such a healthy, positive thing.”Carty tells me he and his girlfriend, also a Thomas fan, don’t yet have children. “Whenever kids come into the picture, it’s going to be a Thomas household,” he says. Then, with the hint of a sigh, he adds: “If they don’t like it, we’ll reconsider.”Brannon Carty will take part in a Q&A following the UK premiere of An Unlikely Fandom atAlstom’s Litchurch Lane Works, Derby, on 2 August.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsChildren's TVTelevisionChildren and teenagersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Well she would, wouldn’t sheTue 22 Jul 2025 11.56 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Jul 2025 12.34 EDTShareYou have to feel for Hannah Ingram-Moore.One or two teensy little mistakes, like using the charity set up in your dad’s name – of which you were chief executive on £85,000 a year – to build a now-demolished spa complex at home, or not giving a portion of your£1.5m book dealto charity as promised, and you find yourself on the sharp end of a hate campaign. So unfair.Thankfully, the daughter of Covid hero Captain Sir Tom Moore, who raised £39m for NHS charities by walking 100 laps of his garden in April 2020, still has love and kindness in her heart despite all this. So much so, in fact, that she’s generously sharing it with the rest of us.For instance: “It’s easy to waste energy worrying about things you can’t control. But here’s the truth – your power lies in how you steady yourself.” Or how about: “When life feels uncertain, which it so often does, let’s lead with kindness. It’s the one thing we never run out of.” And the sort of advice that’s so hard to come by online: “Trust your instinct, you know more than you think.”Yes, in a parable for our times, Ingram-Moore has reinvented herself as aTikTok resilience coach. The 54-year-old is doling out daily mantras that she calls “Moore moments” – which is her name and definitely not another example of using her dad for potential commercial gain. There’s a podcast, too, in which she interviews people about “reinvention, resilience, grief, leadership, legacy, pressure and hope” with “more than a touch of British warmth” – on perfect display when she oh-so warmlyasks one woman“tell us about the horror of the time when your mum was shot during a robbery”.View image in fullscreenIn her podcast, she interviews people about ‘reinvention, resilience, grief, leadership, legacy, pressure and hope’.Photograph: Hannah Ingram-Moore/YouTubeAnyway, the TikTok “moments” are delivered in bite-size selfie-style videos, in which Ingram-Moore clearly hasn’t spent time worrying about trying to control the background noise, or thinking about using her power to steady the camerawork. In one, she’s apparently been struck by a flash of inspirationwhile going up an escalatorand had to deliver her wisdom there and then to her audience of 10.7k, who are definitely not hate-following.As apparent “grifter to guru” narratives go, it’s not so far from the sort of spiritual influencers who use the internet to preach joy and self-reflection, while simultaneously building a personal brand. And if you’re thinking, “hang on, I thought Captain Sir Tom’s daughter had been cancelled”, then you’re woefully behind on cancellation culture which, as things stand, seems to mean a few months of criticism before you can forge a new career on the back of all that notoriety and try to connect authentically to the same general public you previously let down.Or, as Ingram-Moore says: “No one is you and that is your power. You are still writing your story so don’t stop now.”Unfortunately for her, the Charity Commission has finished writing its damning report into Ingram-Moore and her husband, Colin. Itpublished the results of its investigationin November last year and found the family had personally benefited from the Captain Tom Foundation, with “serious and repeated” instances of misconduct and mismanagement, as well as “misleading” the public. Ingram-Moorecalled it “selective storytelling”and said the commission had a “predetermined agenda”.View image in fullscreenHannah Ingram-Moore with her late father, Captain Tom Moore, 30 April 2020.Photograph: Emma Sohl/Capture the Light Photography/PA“The last few years have tested me. The criticism, the judgment, the noise, but here is what I have learned,” she said in one recent TikTok. “Self-doubt gets louder when you’re under pressure. Confidence – that comes from keeping going quietly, consistently, even when people doubt you.”To be fair, she knows of what she speaks. As Ingram-Moore says on her website, advertising her skills as a resilience leader, philanthropist and public speaker (fees on request), she’s “lived it” and can help others with how to “rebuild trust, control your narrative and emerge stronger” after reputational damage.Certainly, she might prefer that to some of the comments left below the line on her self-help videos. “Can you give me advice on how to financially benefit from a charity I’ve set up in honour of a family member please?” says one. “Can you recommend someone who can build an extension?” asks another.“You are ridiculous and ignorant,” is her standard reply. “FACT CHECK: £38.9m went entirely to NHS charities.” As Ingram-Moore puts it: “You don’t have to prove them wrong, you just have to believe in yourself and trust your truth.” Now that’s resilience in action.Claire Cohen is a journalist and the author of BFF?

But if not now, then when?” one cabinet minister said.Earlier this month, nearly 60Labour MPs demandedthat the UK immediately recognise Palestine as a state, after Israel’s defence ministerannounced plansto force all residents of Gaza into a camp on the ruins of Rafah.Israel is facing intensifying international condemnation for its actions in Gaza, with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warning that the “last lifelines keeping people alive [in the strip] are collapsing”.Emmanuel Macron, the French president,told British parliamentariansin a visit this month that a two-state solution was “the only way” to build peace and stability in the region. However, diplomats say he has faced resistance from allies such as Britain and Canada over his push.France and Saudi Arabia are co-chairing a rescheduled international conference at the UN in New York later this month to discuss postwar plans forGazaand preparations for formally acknowledging Palestine.The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, whosaid he felt “appalled, sickened”by the scenes of starving Palestinians being shot as they sought food, said the UK would “play its part” in reaching a two-state solution for the Middle East, including working with the French.“We said we wanted that to be part of a process. But we have had no process. What we have had is mayhem and conflict. There has been no process to attach that recognition to,” he told the BBC on Tuesday.“Why do we say that? It’s because we don’t just want to recognise symbolically, we want to recognise as a way of getting to the two states that sadly many are trying to thwart at this point in time.“But there is a live debate and discussion and let me restate again my belief in two states, and two states in which Palestinians have their dignity and freedom and Israel has its security for its people. We will do all we can to achieve that in time.”In an unusual Commons intervention on Gaza, the health secretary,Wes Streeting, on Tuesday called for recognition of the state of Palestine “while there’s still a state of Palestine left to recognise”.He criticised the “intolerable” attack by Israel on the World Health Organization’s staff residence and main warehouse in Deir al-Balah on Monday, which had compromised its operations in Gaza.Cardinal calls Israel’s policy in Gaza ‘morally unjustifiable’ after visitRead more“I deplore Israel’s attacks on healthcare workers as well as other innocent civilians trying to access healthcare or vital aid. These actions go well beyond legitimate self-defence and undermine the prospects for peace,” he told MPs.“I sincerely hope that the international community can come together, as the foreign secretary has been driving towards, to make sure that we see an end of this war but also that we recognise the state of Palestine while there is a state of Palestine left to recognise.”Streeting is understood to be among the cabinet ministers who have pushed for recognition of Palestine in recent cabinet meetings. The justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, and the Northern Ireland secretary, Hilary Benn, are also understood to have brought up the issue.At the Commons liaison committee on Monday, the prime minister said the situation in Gaza was “intolerable” as he repeated the UK’s commitment to recognising a Palestinian state “at a time most conducive to the prospects of peace” in the region.Israel has been fighting Hamas in the Gaza Strip since the Palestinian militant group’s deadly attack on Israel in October 2023.

He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.” No cause of death was given, though Osbourne had experienced various forms of ill health in recent years.Osbourne was one of the most notorious figures in rock: an innovator whose eerie wail helped usher in heavy metal, a showman who once bit the head off a bat on stage, an addict whose substance abuse led him to attempt to murder his wife, and latterly, a reality TV star much loved for his bemusement at family life on The Osbournes.His death comes less than three weeks after his retirement from performance. On 5 July, Osbourne reunited with his original bandmates in the pioneering group Black Sabbath for the first time since 2005, forBack to the Beginning: an all-star farewell concert featuring some of the biggest names in metal. “I’ve been laid up for six years, and you’ve got no idea how I feel,” he told the crowd that night, referring to extensive health issues including a form of Parkinson’s and numerous surgeries on his spine. “Thank you from the bottom of my heart.”He was born John Michael Osbourne in Aston, Birmingham, in 1948, the son of a pair of factory workers. He had a tough upbringing. As well as living in relative poverty, aged 11 he was repeatedly sexually abused by two boys: “It was terrible … It seemed to go on for ever,” he told the Mirrorin 2003. He was also jailed for burglary: “I was no good at that. Fucking useless,”he admitted in 2014.3:27Ozzy Osbourne, icon of British heavy metal, dies aged 76 – video obituaryThis industrial working-class environment fed into the sound of Osbourne’s defining musical project, Black Sabbath, whose heavy sound revolutionised British rock music. “We wanted to put how we thought about the world at the time,” the band’s bassist, Geezer Butler, said in 2017. “We didn’t want to write happy pop songs. We gave that industrial feeling to it.”View image in fullscreenBlack Sabbath in the 70s … from left, Geezer Butler, Tony Iommi, Bill Ward and Ozzy Osbourne.Photograph: Chris Walter/WireImageNamed after a Boris Karloff horror movie, the band, also featuring Tony Iommi on guitar and Bill Ward on drums, released their self-titled debut in 1970, followed by further albums regarded as foundation stones of the heavy-metal genre. Paranoid (1970) featured the strutting anthems Iron Man and War Pigs and topped the UK album chart, while the cacophonous, psychedelic sound of Master of Reality (1971) remains a huge influence on the slower sound of doom metal.Osbourne recorded a further five acclaimed albums with the group, but became so dependent on alcohol and drugs that he was fired in 1979, and replaced by Ronnie James Dio. Osbourne eventually returned to the band for the 2013 album 13, which topped the charts in the US and UK. Black Sabbath also went on tour, playing what was billed as their final concert in Birmingham on 4 February 2017, prior to their 2025 reunion gig.Osbourne went solo shortly after leaving Black Sabbath, and beginning with 1980’s Blizzard of Ozz – which went five times platinum in the US – released 13 studio albums, the most recent being 2022’s Patient Number 9.The most notorious incident involving Osbourne happened in 1982, when he bit off the head of a dead bat he believed to be a stage prop while performing in Des Moines, Iowa. He later went to hospital to receive a precautionary rabies inoculation. He also claimed – and this was corroborated by his one-time publicist Mick Wall – to have bitten the heads off two doves during a 1981 record label meeting that went sour, having originally intended to release the birds as a sign of peace.In the 80s and 90s, he had occasional UK Top 40 hits, including Bark at the Moon (1983) and Perry Mason (1995). He eventually hit No 1 in 2003 with Changes, a duet with his daughter Kelly, 40.View image in fullscreenOzzy Osbourne and Sharon Osbourne pictured in 2014.Photograph: Dave Hogan/MTV 2014/Getty ImagesOsbourne has two other children with wife Sharon – Jack, 39, and Aimee, 41 – and two with first wife, Thelma – Jessica and Louis. His marriage to Thelma had deteriorated because of his alcoholism, and he later admitted he couldn’t remember Jessica and Louis being born.In 1982, he married Sharon, who had begun managing his solo career after the pair met three years earlier. Her business acumen paired with his enduring popularity helped them accrue huge wealth. Ozzfest, the metal music festival founded by Sharon in 1996, toured the US most years and also had outings in the UK and Japan.In 1989, he was arrested for attempting to murder Sharon by strangling her while drunk. He recounted the incident ina 2007 interview: “I woke up in this little single cell with human shit up the walls – and I thought, ‘What the fuck have I done now?’ … [A police officer] read me a piece of paper, and said, ‘You’re charged with attempting to murder Mrs Sharon Osbourne.’ I can’t tell you how I felt. I just went numb.” The couple later reconciled, though briefly split again in 2016 after Ozzy was unfaithful with a hair stylist.Ozzy and Sharon, along with Kelly and Jack, appeared in the reality TV series The Osbournes from 2002 to 2005. A fly-on-the-wall documentary series that followed the family’s domestic life – complete with dog therapists, “vagina doctors” and an endless stream of imaginative bad language from everyone – it became a ratings hit, and, in 2002, the second ever winner of the Emmy award for outstanding reality programme.Ozzy broke his neck, collarbone and ribs in a quad biking accident at his Buckinghamshire homein 2003. Sharon later said he had stopped breathing for a minute and a half “and there was no pulse”; he was also told he was almost paralysed by the accident. In 2005, he was diagnosed with Parkin syndrome, which causes bodily tremors.In 2013, following years of sobriety, he admitted he had been drinking and taking drugs for a year and a half, but was committed to becoming sober again,saying: “I was in a very dark place and was an asshole to the people I love most, my family.”In 2019, Osbourne performed what was billed as his final world tour, entitled No More Tours 2. (He first announced his retirement in 1992 with the No More Tours tour, but later reversed his decision.) Illness forced him to postpone the European dates in 2020. “It just seems that since October, everything I touch has turned to shit,” he said in an apologetic statement – he had also spent time in hospital to receive treatment for an infection in his hand.In 2020 he announced he had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s, and in 2022 had surgery on his spine, having suffered a fall in 2019 that exacerbated the earlier quad biking injuries. In 2023, he cancelled a UK and Europe tour due to being “physically weak”, describing “three operations, stem cell treatments, endless physical therapy sessions, and most recently groundbreaking Cybernics (HAL) treatment.”View image in fullscreenOzzy Osbourne on stage at Back to the Beginning, 5 July.Photograph: Ross HalfinOsbourne became depressed amid the extensive treatment, as he described in a May 2025 interview with the Guardian. “You wake up the next morning and find that something else has gone wrong. You begin to think this is never going to end,” he said. “Sharon could see that I was in Doom Town, and she says to me, ‘I’ve got an idea.’ It was something to give me a reason to get up in the morning.”This was the Back to the Beginning concert held at Villa Park in Birmingham, which saw Osbourne reunite with Butler, Iommi and Ward for a four-song set, after a five-song solo set. Osbourne performed seated in a bat-adorned throne, but put in a spirited performance, telling the audience at one point: “I am Iron Man: go fucking crazy!” The concert also featured performances by legends including Metallica, Slayer and Guns N’ Roses.Elton John was among those paying tribute to Osbourne, writing: “He was a dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods – a true legend. He was also one of the funniest people I’ve ever met. I will miss him dearly.”Explore more on these topicsOzzy OsbourneMetalSharon OsbournePop and rockReality TVTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Remember the day. Chloe Kelly may have scored the winner, poking in the rebound from her saved penalty deep into extra time, but it was Michelle Agyemang – whose surname translates literally as “saviour of a nation” – who stepped up when it mattered most, scoring the goal to force that extra time against Italy which began the charge to a third successive final.The banner held up in the small block of Italian fans behind the goal read “football’s coming to Rome” – “home” bruisingly crossed out – and for much of the 90 minutes it looked like it was.England 2-1 Italy: Women’s Euro 2025 semi-final player ratingsRead moreBarbara Bonansea’s first-half goal for Italy had seemingly secured a first final for Andrea Soncin’s side since 1997, but in the final minute of added time England’s 19-year-old wonderkid scored her second critical goal of the tournament to keep their title defence alive before Kelly, the scorer of England’sextra time winner in the 2022 final, delivered again.The Lionesses had escaped group D after a staggeringly bad performance in theiropening game against France, and came from two goals down against Sweden to win on penalties, and in Geneva that battling spirit was on show again, eventually. “The English are never done,” Leah Williamson had said down the camera in 2022 on the way to a first major title, and in 2025 the next generation of super subs stepped up when it mattered most.The 30,000-capacity Stade de Genève did not feel like a fitting place for a semi-final as it is approached. You weave your way through a graffitied industrial jungle and past a scrap‑metal yard towards a stadium with an exterior that is less brutalist beauty and more brutally ugly.It was the fans who provided the colour, though, England supporters sweeping towards the stadium in numbers far greater than those from close neighbours Italy, expectations of a third successive final high.Inside the odd arena, however, the vibe is completely different. It is a paradise, the stands nestled against the pitch with mountains peering over the top as cartoon eyebrow‑like paragliders swept above them.For those hoping for a performance to match the beauty of the surroundings, there would be disappointment. The3-2 penalty victory against Swedenafter they came from two goals to force extra time had been a shambles in the first half, but battling in the second.It was far better from England against Italy in the opening 45 minutes. Wiegman had made one change for the three-hour trip west of Zurich and it was a characteristically pragmatic one.View image in fullscreenBarbara Bonansea scores the opening goal for Italy to stun the Lionesses.Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw/ReutersJess Carter, who so bravely spoke out on Sundayagainst the racist abuseshe has suffered during the tournament, was dropped in favour of Esme Morgan and England generally looked a more settled side. Italy maybe eight places below the Lionesses in the Fifa world rankings, but they had scored first in every game in Switzerland.They are a well-organised unit, a team that have really gone up a gear and grown as a collective as they have progressed to their first semi‑final since 1997.It had been an even opening half-hour, Wiegman’s side edging things possession wise but Italy were prepared for that, perhaps seeing more of the ball than they had expected.It was Sofia Cantore, who masterminded the goal to give them another lead, the Washington Spirit-bound forward beating Alex Greenwood to the byline and putting the ball into the middle where it grazed the thigh of Lucy Bronze before falling to Bonansea, who took a touch before smashing the ball into the roof of the net from a tight angle.The celebrations were wild, almost the entire Italy starting XI bundling together with their substitutes in the England dugout just to rub salt in the wound. England had chances, but they did not take them in the opening 45 minutes, Alessia Russo putting an effort wide and Lauren James twice forced saves from Laura Giuliani, neither having quite enough power behind them. James was withdrawn in favour of Beth Mead at the start of the second half, the Chelsea forward worryingly seen with ice on her foot.The Italians were dealt a big blow around the hour when the tearful talismanic captain, Cristiana Girelli, exited seemingly with a hamstring issue, to be replaced by Martina Piemonte.

Bronze had a header cleared off the line and Hannah Hampton made a double save to keep England in it.The final roll of the dice came with five minutes left, Russo and Leah Williamson departing in place of Agyemang and Aggie Beever-Jones as England went for an all-out attack.The gamble paid off, Agyemang the hero, firing in with a minute of added time remaining to secure another 30 minutes of football. That half‑hour was torturous, England’s new-look XI, in its slapdash shape, desperately sought the winner.Agyemang went closest, her clipped effort coming back off the bar before Emma Severini’s challenge on Beth Mead earned the holders a penalty. Giuliani saved Kelly’s spot‑kick, but she was first to the loose ball and poked it in to set up a final against either Germany or Spain.

Democrats in turn accused the GOP of leaving town rather than dealing with the outcry over Donald Trump’s handling of the investigation into the alleged sex trafficker.“They are actually ending this week early because they’re afraid to cast votes on theJeffrey Epsteinissue,” said Ted Lieu, the vice-chair of the House Democratic caucus.Tucker Carlson channels Maga rage over Epstein files – and opens rift with TrumpRead moreRepublicans downplayed the decision to cut short the workweek, while arguing that the White House has already moved to resolve questions about the case. Last week, Trumpasked the attorney general, Pam Bondi, to release grand jury testimony, although that is expected to be only a fraction of the case’s documents.“We’re going to have committee meetings through Thursday, and there’s still a lot of work being done,” said the majority leader, Steve Scalise. “The heavy work is done in committee and there is a lot of work being done this week before we head out.” He declined to answer a question about whether votes were cut short over the Epstein files.At a press conference, the House speaker,Mike Johnson, insisted that Congress must be careful in calling for the release of documents related to the case, for fear of retraumatizing his victims.“There’s no purpose for Congress to push an administration to do something that they’re already doing. And so this is for political games,” he said. “I’m very resolute on this, we can both call for full transparency and also protect victims, and if you run roughshod, or you do it too quickly, that’s not what happens.”Questions surrounding Epstein’s 2019 death and his involvement in running a sex-trafficking ring that allegedly procured underage girls for global elites flared up earlier this month afterthe justice department announcedits determination that he committed suicide in a federal prison, and he had no client list that could be released.The disclosure, along with the department’s statement that it would release no further information about the case,sparked an uproaramong many supporters of the president, who believed he would get to the bottom of a supposed “deep state” plot to cover up Epstein’s ties to global elites. Some of Trump’s own officials had promoted such expectations, including Bondi, who in February told Fox News that Epstein’s client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review”.Congressional Democrats have sought to capitalize on the rare split between the president and his supporters, with an eye towards retaking the majority in the House next year. The venue for those efforts has been the rules committee, the normally low-key body that all legislation must pass through before it is considered by the full House.Democrats on the committee last weekrepeatedly offered amendmentsto unrelated legislation that were designed to compel the release of the Epstein files, forcing Republicans to vote them down – a politically difficult vote for many in the party, as it could potentially be used to accused them of wanting to keep the files secret.Frustration among the GOP peaked on Monday, when Democrats planned to use a rules committee hearing to offer more Epstein amendments, and the GOP reacted by refusing to vote on any more rules, essentially paralyzing the House floor. Johnson has attempted to stem the controversy by agreeing to allow a vote on a non-binding resolution on the file’s release, but that won’t happen before the August recess.On Tuesday, a House oversight subcommitteeapproved a subpoenaproposed by Republican congressman Tim Burchett for the testimony of Ghislaine Maxwell, a close associate of Epstein who is serving a 20-year prison sentence related to the sex trafficking case. The justice department is also seeking to speak with her, and it is unclear when she might appear before Congress.Meanwhile, Thomas Massie, a libertarian-leaning Republican who has repeatedly broken with his party, and Democratic congressman Ro Khanna have collaborated on a legislative maneuver that will force a vote on releasing the Epstein files, though that is not expected to take place until after the House returns from its recess, in the first week of September.Joe Morelle, the number-two Democrat on the House appropriations committee, warned that cutting short the workweek costs time that lawmakers could use to consider spending legislation that must be passed by the end of September to prevent a government shutdown.“We haven’t done appropriation bills, and yet we’re going to take extra days off simply because we don’t want to go through the discomfort of pushing the president to do what he’s promised to do, what the attorney general has promised to do, what the FBI director has promised to do, that they’re now violating their pledge and their commitment to do,” Morelle said.Explore more on these topicsRepublicansHouse of RepresentativesMike JohnsonJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Officially known as the plan for neighbourhoods, it is intended to invest £1.5bn in 75 areas over the next decade.However, ministers are also mindful of the more immediate worry of a repeat of last summer’s disorder, after which there were more than 1,800 arrests and nearly 1,100 charges, with hundreds of people jailed.One potential flashpoint could be an asylum hotel in Epping, Essex, which has been the target for a series ofprotests in recent days, and where police were attacked.The far-right agitator known as Tommy Robinson has promised on social media to bring “thousands” of people to join a mass protest at the hotel on Sunday. Similar demonstrations have taken place at a hotel in Diss, Norfolk.There are procedures for the prime minister to be kept informed even when he is away. Starmer cancelled his summer holiday last year because of the rioting. Officials have refused to comment on any contingency plans in place this year, saying they could not “get into speculation”.There is an additional political impetus for ministers to take seriously the possibility of wider disorder given the likelihood it would be exploited by Nigel Farage, who useda speech about crimeon Monday to say much of the UK was experiencing “nothing short of societal collapse”.He told an event: “I don’t think anybody in London can understand just how close we are to civil disobedience on a vast scale in this country.”Government officials insisted, however, that the cabinet discussion was not a response to the Reform UK leader, pointing to previous comments about the many social drivers of dissatisfaction that were made by Starmer after last year’s disorder.“The broad point is that we have to invest in our social fabric,” one said. “People have felt for years that governments have not delivered for them. We need to deliver change they can feel.”Among initiatives launched after the summer riots was a cross-party commission intended to examine and ease community divisions. The Independent Commission on Community and Cohesion met for the first time in June.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumAngela RaynerThe far rightEnglandLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Critics say the legislation allows political interference and is a major step backwards in the fight against corruption.Late on Tuesday Zelenskyy signed the bill into law, rejecting calls for him to use his presidential veto, according to reports. The decision has yet to be posted on the government’s website.View image in fullscreenA woman chants while holding a banner that reads ‘Corruption Applauds’ during a protest against a law targeting anti-corruption institutions in central Kyiv on Tuesday.Photograph: Alex Babenko/APEarlier, about 1,500 protesters gathered next to Zelenskyy’s presidential administration complex. They shouted slogans outside his window including “Shame” and “Veto the law” and waved homemade banners denouncing the bill.There were protests in other large cities including Dnipro, Lviv and Odesa. “If the bill goes ahead it will make it harder for Ukraine to join the European Union. We will go back to dictatorship,” said Sasha Kazintseva before Zelenskyy reportedly gave his approval.“We don’t want to be like Russia. Zelenskyy is still our president. But when he does the wrong things we will say so.”Her friend Tetiana Kukuruza held up a cardboard sign with the blunt slogan: “Are you fucking crazy?”She explained: “This is the first time since 2022 that we’ve taken to the streets. We know the names of the deputies who voted for this bill. I’m not saying they are corrupt. But they have interests.”The protesters gathered in a park immediately below a rococo 19th-century government building, the House of Chimeras. The crowd was made up of students, young activists and army veterans, some of them draped in blue and yellow Ukrainian flags. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, also took part, together with his brotherWladimir.Veronika Mol, an artist, said she worried Ukraine was sliding back to the era of Viktor Yanukovych, the corrupt pro-Russian president who fled to Moscow in 2014 after months of street protests.“I’m surprised this has happened. It looks like some madness. I don’t know what their motives are,” she said.“People are the power in Ukraine. Not the president or government. It’s terrible we still have to remind them.”There has been vocal condemnation of the bill from prominent soldiers, a celebrity chef and Ukraine’s media. The writer Illia Ponomarenko said civil society was fighting “the dark side of its own state” in parallel with the war against Russia.He criticised “corruption, abuse of power, lies, lack of transparency, nepotism, impunity, and attacks on democracy and freedom of speech – everything that keeps dragging us back toward the abyss, back into Russia’s colonial criminal stable”.Several of Ukraine’s high-profile international supporters expressed concern. They included the former US ambassador to Moscow Mike McFaul and the Estonian ex-president Toomas Hendrik Ilves. There was also recognition that protesters could freely voice anti-government opinions – unlike in Russia.Ukraine’s application to join the EU is dependent on the progress it makes in fighting corruption. Since 2022, EU countries have provided Kyiv with significant military and economic support running into billions of euros.The European commissioner for enlargement, Marta Kos, criticised the bill’s adoption.“The dismantling of key safeguards protecting [anti-corruption bureau] Nabu’s independence is a serious step back,” Koswroteon social media, saying that the two bodies were “essential” for Ukraine’s EU path.Explore more on these topicsVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They are demandinga 29% pay risethat they say would restore salaries that have been eroded over the past decade.Streeting said talks had been constructive but suggested goodwill had been squandered by the decision not to pause strike action.“After constructive discussion with BMA representatives in recent days, the opportunity was there for the BMA to work with us on a range of options that would have made a real difference to resident doctors’ working conditions and created extra roles to deal with the bottlenecks that hold back their career progression,” he said. “Instead, they have recklessly and needlessly opted for strike action.”The health secretary said the BMA “would have lost nothing by taking up the offer to postpone strike action to negotiate a package that would improve the working lives of resident doctors”.“By refusing to do so, they will cause unnecessary disruption to patients, put additional pressure on their NHS colleagues and not take the opportunity to improve their own working conditions,” Streeting added.He said there was no further room for the government to move on pay and that the demands were unacceptable and unaffordable. “All of my attention will be now on averting harm to patients and supporting NHS staff at work,” he said.“After a 28.9% pay hike in the last three years and the highest pay rise in the public sector two years in a row, strike action is completely unjustified, completely unprecedented in the history of British trade unionism and shows a complete disdain for patients and the wider recovery of the NHS.”In a statement confirming the strikes would go ahead, the BMA resident doctors committee co-chairs, Dr Melissa Ryan and Dr Ross Nieuwoudt, said they had been trying to “urgently reach a compromise” but that the offer from the Department of Health had been inadequate.View image in fullscreenDr Ross Nieuwoudt and Dr Melissa Ryan said they were not made an offer that took their pay restoration demands seriously.Photograph: Yui Mok/PA“We have always said that no doctor wants to strike and all it would take to avoid it is a credible path to pay restoration offered by the government. We came to talks in good faith, keen to explore real solutions to the problems facing resident doctors today,” they said. “Unfortunately, we did not receive an offer that would meet the scale of those challenges.”The committee co-chairs said more than a fifth of resident doctors’ pay had been eroded since 2008 and the “simplest and most direct means … is to raise our pay”. That was clearly off the table in the talks, the BMA said.“We had hoped that there would be enough new ideas about relieving these burdens that we could make some progress in these talks. Disappointingly, what we saw would not have been significant enough to change the day-to-day financial situation for our members.”Before the industrial action, a row has also broken out between the NHS leadership and the doctors’ trade union, who had alleged the NHS was putting patient safety at risk bynot cancelling planned treatmentduring a forthcoming strike.During previous strikes, urgent and emergency services have been staffed by senior hospital doctors, including consultants, and pre-planned work was largely postponed.But the BMA said hospital leaders had been told to continue with scheduled non-urgent care during the forthcoming dispute, which they said could cause doctors to be overstretched and put patients in danger. NHS Providers, a membership organisation for NHS Trusts, said it was the BMA’s strike action putting patient safety at risk.Resident doctors on strikes: ‘For those of us who are working class, the stakes are different’Read moreThe chief executive of NHS Providers, Daniel Elkeles, said the decision to press ahead with industrial action was “a crushing blow for patients and for the NHS” and said trusts have been holding off cancellations while there was the realistic prospect of a breakthrough.“They will now be doing all they can to ensure there are fewer – and in some cases many fewer – cancellations than last time,” he said. “We urge resident doctors to help trusts minimise the harm by notifying them of their plans for strike days.“For example, we must ensure that there are enough staff for all the cancer, transplant and maternity care that cannot and must not be delayed. Another huge worry is the cost. It is vital that consultants providing cover take NHS rates of pay rather than insisting on inflated BMA rates that are simply unaffordable.“All avenues for discussion should be exhausted before turning to strikes. We say to the BMA: think again and pull back from this hugely damaging decision.”Responding to the news that the resident doctors strike would go ahead, Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said: “Unacceptable delays and barriers to accessing the care patients need have been the reality for years. This latest strike adds even more uncertainty for people who are waiting in pain, with anxiety, and without answers, and will leave more patients vulnerable and unsupported as their health and wellbeing deteriorates.”Explore more on these topicsNHSWes StreetingHealthIndustrial actionnewsShareReuse this content"

I’d much rather see a great big strapping male police officer with a female.”She added that women police officers “look vulnerable” and should be deployed to “more sensitive situations”, such as dealing with children or women who have suffered from domestic violence.One chief constable told the Guardian that not just chiefs were annoyed, but rank-and-file officers also: “It takes us back 30 years, and it has annoyed my work force as well. To suggest women officers are not equal because they are not of a certain size and shape, is a disservice.”The chief said physical confrontation was nowadays a “minuscule” part of the job and women were also more likely to make an arrest without the need for force.Reform UK also pledged 30,000 more officers, costing an estimated £2bn.The chief said up to 40% of new recruits were women, and that Reform’s comments would deter women from joining if the party was looking to boost police numbers.Explore more on these topicsPoliceWomenReform UKShareReuse this content"

It is part of the jubilee, a year-long period of reflection and penance organised by the church every 25 years.Among those attending the 28-29 July event will beFather Cosimo Schena, the suave priest of San Francesco church in the southern Italian city of Brindisi. He became known as “the poet of God’s love” after publishing spiritual poems across his social media accounts and amassing more than 450,000 followers on Instagram.Don Ambrogio Mazzai said the key to his success was keeping his content brief.Schena, 46, is also known for welcoming animals to his parish and in a reel featuring his two dogs he wrote how God’s love and healing could be transmitted “through a wagging hug” or “a paw resting on your sadness”. The priest became more active on social media in 2022 as a way to spread peace and positivity after the pandemic.His evangelisation has not just made him an internet star, he has achieved his aim of attracting more people to mass.“Not just people who live locally,” Schena told the Guardian. “There are people who come from other parts ofItalyand even other countries. Some simply come to say hello, but the important thing is to deliver a beautiful and credible testimony, and to spread God’s universal language of love. I get lots of messages from people seeking help and comfort, and not just from those who believe in God.”Among the influencer clerics expected to attend the jubilee event, which is aimed at Catholic youth, isFather Giuseppe Fusari, a tattooed priest at a church in the northern city of Brescia, who combines his passions – art history and bodybuilding – to share God’s message. Another expected participant, Stefano Maria Bordignon, a friar known online asFraStefano, uses YouTube to read and comment on the gospel. “Following him is like going to mass every day,” wrote the Italian newspaperCorriere della Sera.Father Ambrogio Mazzai, a priest who imparts church teachings alongside photos of himself playing the guitar or holding a glass of wine, won’t be attending the event as he has to preside over a wedding and a baptism. But, the 34-year-old said, the key to his success was keeping his content brief. “I share messages of faith or reflection – sometimes provocative, sometimes ironic,” he added. “You have to communicate concisely and in a way that attracts attention – so no great long sermons.”Explore more on these topicsReligionCatholicismSocial mediaPope FrancisItalyChristianityDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

Three boys near me were martyred,” says the 36-year-old, who has four children. “I didn’t even get anything, just two empty boxes.”Jamal’s journey involved a long walk to and from a former residential neighbourhood bulldozed by Israeli forces and turned into one of four militarised aid distribution centres run by theGazaHumanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is based in Delaware in the US.Video sent by Raed JamalAn extract from a video sent by Raed Jamal.The GHF sites – Tal al-Sultan, Saudi neighbourhood, Khan Younis and Wadi Gaza – are located in evacuation zones, which means civilians seeking food have to enter areas they have been ordered to leave. According to GHF’s Facebook page, the sites remain open for as little as eight minutes at a time, and in June the average for the Saudi site was 11 minutes. These factors have led to accusations from NGOs that the system is dangerous by design. The Unrwa chief, Philippe Lazzarini,has said“the so-called mechanism … is a death trap costing more lives than it saves.”The system favours the strongest, so it is mostly men who travel along the designated routes. Then they wait – often for hours – for a centre to open. Finally, there is a dash into the centre of the zones and a scramble to grab a box.Satellite image showing the journey made by Raed JamalAt every stage, those seeking aid pass Israeli tanks and troops, as quadcopters fly above. In another clip shared by Jamal he ducks as bullets pass overhead.Video sent by Raed Jamal“We have purged our hearts of fear,” Jamal says of his near daily walks to the site. “I need to bring food for my children so they don’t die of hunger.”A new system, and near daily deathsGHF, a startup organisation with no experience of distributing food in complex conflict zones, employs US mercenaries at the sites, which opened in May. They replaced 400 non-militarised aid points run under a UN system that Israel claimed had to be shut down because Hamas was diverting aid from it. No evidence for this has been provided.Map showing the location of Gaza Humanitarian Foundation sites in GazaSince May,more than 1,000 people have died while seeking foodfrom the centres and other humanitarian convoys, according to the UN.Chart showing the number of deaths and injuries while seeking aid in GazaThe sites’ opening times are usually announced in posts on aFacebook accountand, more recently, messages sent through a Telegram channel. A WhatsApp channel was also set up in the first weeks. People have been warned not to approach the centres until they open.As the chart below shows, for the site Jamal visited, the amount of time between the site’s opening time being announced and the opening itself decreased dramatically in June.Chart showing the timings of posts made on the GFH Facebook page for the Saudi centreMahmoud Alareer, a 27-year-old living in a tent in western Gaza City, says the opening time announcements for the aid site he uses – Wadi Gaza – have become useless, because of the distance from where he is living. Instead, he travels to the edges of the site in the middle of the night and gambles on it opening at 2am, as it has on every visit so far.Satellite image showing Mahmoud Alareer’s journeyFirst he climbs on to the back of a truck for the long ride south from Gaza City through the militarised Netzarim corridor. Then he waits in the dark until Israeli forces allow him to enter. “You get there and you slowly, slowly advance,” he says. “You always know that it could be you who gets shot, or it might be someone next to you.”Alareer says chaos always ensues when the aid point opens, as people start running towards the packages, which are left in the middle of the distribution zone. People trip over craters and tangled wires.View image in fullscreenPalestinians carry parcels at night as they walk back from a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation distribution point in central Gaza.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesGHF has faced severe criticism from the humanitarian community due to the dangers posed to Palestinians both at the sites and on the roads around them. In early July,more than 170 NGOs called for GHF to be shut down, accusing it of violating the principles of humanitarian aid, and calling for the resumption of non-militarised aid in Gaza.A street in Gaza, a map of dreams, and the people desperate to liveRead moreMédecins Sans Frontières’ (MSF) emergency coordinator in Gaza, Aitor Zabalgogeazkoa, says night-time distributions are particularly dangerous because so many roads in southern Gaza have been made unrecognisable by Israeli bombing, making it hard for Palestinians to stick to routes designated by GHF.Zabalgogeazkoa is scathing about the GHF system. “This is not humanitarian aid,” he says. “We can only think that it was designed to cause damage to the people seeking aid.”A GHF spokesperson denied that their system was unsafe, claiming that the danger was outside their distribution zones. They also accused the UN of using “exaggerated” casualty figures.The IDF have been contacted for comment.GHF has previously defended its operations and accused its critics of engaging in a “turf war” over humanitarian supplies. It says it bears no responsibility for deaths outside the perimeters of its sites.The Israeli militaryhas previously acknowledged firing warning shotsat Palestinians who it says have approached its forces in a suspicious manner. It has also disputed some of the death tolls provided by the Palestinian authorities.Palestinians’ unmet aid needsGHF runs only four sites to feed 2 million people, in a territory where extreme hunger is widespread andfood security experts have warned of looming famine. According to figures released by Gaza’s health ministry 33 people have died due to starvation and malnutrition since Sunday.It says it has delivered more than 85 million meals “via roughly 1,422,712 boxes” since its operations began. According to these figures, each box would provide a family with about 60 meals. The organisation has posted photos of GHF-marked boxes that have items such as flour, potatoes, beans and oil. However, Palestinians in Gaza have shared pictures showing open boxes at GHF sites containing a smaller range of items.View image in fullscreenLeft: an IDF handout showing the contents of a GHF food parcel.

This sequence shows damage to greenhouses and orchards in Beit Lahiya.Before/afterIn late March, dozens of bakeries supported by the WFP halted production due to the Israeli blockade. A handful briefly resumed bread production in May when some trucks were allowed into the territory, as this timeline shows.Jamal reiterates that he has no choice but to return to his nearest GHF site, despite the dangers. “I have gone four days in a row and not brought anything back, not even flour – nothing,” he says. “Sometimes you just can’t beat the others. But what else can we do, our life is a struggle.”This article was amended on 22 July 2025. An earlier version said the price of flour in Gaza had risen by 31 May to $420 per kg. This was based on a published UN figure that had later been corrected to $420 for a 25kg bag.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaConflict and armsAidIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a career stretching across six decades, Osbourne became a star withBlack Sabbathin the 1970s, launched a hugely successful solo career in the 1980s, turned himself into a heavy metal entrepreneur in the 1990s with his travelling Ozzfest rock festival, and in 2002 became an unlikely but wildly successful reality TV star, thanks to the MTV show The Osbournes.TheBlack Sabbathrepertoire included songs with titles such as Paranoid, Evil Woman, Hand of Doom and Children of the Grave. The atmosphere was darkened further by the guitarist Tony Iommi’s fondness for tuning his strings lower than usual, and lyrics (mostly written by the bass player Geezer Butler) that alluded to the occult and mental illness, sung in Osbourne’s urgent high-register whine. His voice was not pretty but it was impossible to ignore as it sliced through Sabbath’s dense sludge of drums, bass and fuzz-toned guitar. “Sabbath never set out to be legendary,” Osbourne said in 2005. “The only thing we set out to do was scare people.”Sabbath were a hit straight out of the blocks with their debut album, Black Sabbath (1970), which sailed into the UK Top 10 and reached 23 on the US Billboard chart, despite a hostile response from rock critics. Later that year they released the follow-up, Paranoid, which topped the British chart. Its tough and edgytitle songgave them their only British Top 10 single (it went to No 4), whileIron Manand the outspokenly politicalWar Pigsbecame staples of the Sabbath catalogue, each featuring a distinctive Iommi guitar riff.View image in fullscreenOzzy Osbourne on stage with Black Sabbath at the Lewisham Odeon, London, 27 May 1978.Photograph: Gus Stewart/Getty ImagesThe band’s hot streak continued through the albums Master of Reality (1971), Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973) and Sabotage (1975), but Never Say Die! (1978) signalled Osbourne’s departure and the end of Sabbath mark one. Following some chaotic touring and abortive recording sessions, Osbourne was fired in 1979. An alcohol-and-cocaine lifestyle coupled with legal squabbles with their management and record label had sapped the band’s strength. “I was drinking like a fish for two years,” Osbourne said. “I would have been dead in two or three years if I’d carried on.”Black Sabbath were managed by the notably unsentimental music mogulDon Arden, who assigned his daughter, Sharon, to keep Ozzy sufficiently acquainted with the straight and narrow to be able to write songs and perform. She became his manager and, in 1982, his wife. She launched him as a solo artist, leading his own band, The Blizzard of Ozz, which featured the gifted guitarist and songwriter Randy Rhoads. When Warner Bros and EMI turned Osbourne down as a solo artist, Sharon signed him to her father’s label, Jet. Osbourne’s solo career was immediately successful, his debut album, Blizzard of Ozz (1980), producing a couple of hit singles with Crazy Train and Mr Crowley, the latter inspired by the occultist Aleister Crowley.View image in fullscreenOzzy Osbourne with his then fiancee, Sharon Arden, Los Angeles, 1981.Photograph: Douglas Pizac/AP/PA PhotosThe follow-up, Diary of a Madman (1981), was another bestseller – in his autobiography,I Am Ozzy(2010), Osbourne cited this as his favourite album – and contained the drug-inspired hit singleFlying High Again. However, Osbourne’s progress was rarely incident-free, and, marriage aside, 1982 was a particular annus horribilis. In January that year, when he was perfoming in Des Moines, Iowa, an audience member threw what Osbourne took to be a rubber bat onstage, whereupon he bit its head off only to discover that the creature was real flesh and blood. He was forced to seek precautionary treatment for rabies.The following month, he was arrested in San Antonio, Texas, after urinating on the Alamo cenotaph. As a police officer remarked, “Son, when you piss on the Alamo, you piss on the state of Texas.” Osbourne was banned from performing in the city until 1992, when he made a public apology and donated $10,000 to maintaining the monument. In March 1982, Rhoads was killed in Florida while joyriding in a Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft, which crashed.The albums Bark at the Moon (1983), The Ultimate Sin (1986) and No Rest for the Wicked (1988) carried Osbourne through the 1980s on a surging tide of sales, but controversy was never far away. In 1986 he was sued by the parents of Daniel McCollom, who had killed himself while listening to Blizzard of Ozz; the parents contended that the song Suicide Solution was a “proximate cause” of his death. The case was dismissed in 1988, but Osbourne was then sued by the parents of another young man, Michael Waller, who alleged that their son too was driven to kill himself by hidden messages in the song. Again, the suit was dismissed.In 1989 Osbourne was arrested for attempted murder after trying to strangle Sharon while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. This caused him to spend six months in rehab. After he recorded the album No More Tears (1991), he announced that the tour to promote it (he called it No More Tours) would be his last before he retired. The album contained Osbourne’s only Top 40 solo hit single in the US,Mama, I’m Coming Home. The song was addressed to Sharon, from whom he was temporarily estranged.View image in fullscreenKelly, Jack and Ozzy Osbourne, from the first season of The Osbournes, 2002.Photograph: MTV/Everett/Rex FeaturesRecordings from the tour were released as Live & Loud (1993), which included many of his best-known songs, with the other members of Black Sabbath joining Osbourne for the trackBlack Sabbath. Live & Loud was intended to bring the curtain down on his career, and the trackI Don’t Want To Change The Worldwon him a Grammy for best metal performance in 1994.Ozzy was born John Osbourne in Aston, Birmingham. His father, Jack, did night shifts at the industrial company GEC, while his mother, Lillian (nee Unitt), worked for the motor components firm Lucas. He had three older sisters, Jean, Iris and Gillian, and two younger brothers, Paul and Tony. The family managed to squeeze into a two-bedroom home with an outside toilet in Lodge Road, Aston.He acquired the nickname “Ozzy” at primary school, after being initially dubbed “Oz-brain”, and while his school work was hampered by dyslexia, he showed interest in music and performing when he took roles in school productions of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas including The Pirates of Penzance, HMS Pinafore and The Mikado. Soon, the influence of the Beatles loomed large. Ozzy claimed he had originally wanted to be a plumber, then decided he wanted to be a Beatle instead.He left school at 15 and took a variety of jobs, including trainee plumber, slaughterhouse assistant and apprentice toolmaker, and for a time worked at the same Lucas factory as his mother, where he tuned car-horns. An amateurish attempt at petty crime led to him being arrested while trying to steal a television, and he spent six weeks in Winson Green prison.View image in fullscreenOzzy Osborne at his home in Beverly Hills, California, 1987.Photograph: Eddie Sanderson/Getty ImagesAfter a stint as vocalist with an R&B band called the Approach, in 1967 Osbourne was recruited by Butler to sing with his band, Rare Breed. The group imploded almost immediately, whereupon Osbourne and Butler joined Iommi and the drummer Bill Ward to form Earth. In 1969 they changed their name to Black Sabbath, after a 1963 horror film featuring Boris Karloff. With help from the Birmingham club owner Jim Simpson, who acted as their manager, the band secured a deal with Vertigo Records, which released their debut album, recorded and mixed in two days.Osbourne’s early 1990s retirement lasted only until 1995, when he came roaring back with a new album, Ozzmosis. Though hardly a classic, this sold three million copies within 12 months, and, after his follow-up Retirement Sucks tour proved one of the biggest successes of the summer, Osbourne and Sharon created the heavy metal touring package that they dubbed Ozzfest. This became an annual event in the US, Europe and eventually Japan.Ozzfest presented a huge array of metal, thrash and hardcore bands, from Metallica and Judas Priest to Slipknot, Slayer, System of a Down and Linkin Park. In 2004 Ozzy and Sharon presented Battle for Ozzfest on MTV, in which bands competed to be included on the 2005 bill.In 1997 Ozzfest included a Black Sabbath reunion, after which the band recorded the live album Reunion (1998) and continued touring into 1999, appearing again at Ozzfest. A mooted new Black Sabbath studio album was put on hold while Osbourne completed a solo album, Down to Earth (2001).It was now that his career took its surprising lurch into TV. Following an appearance on MTV’s reality show Cribs, about celebrity homes, the Osbourne family were recruited for their own series,The Osbournes, which ran for three years from 2002. Featuring Ozzy and Sharon with their children Jack and Kelly – their elder daughter Aimee hated the idea and opted out – it resembled a surreal, outlandish sitcom liberally spattered with X-rated language, and became one of MTV’s greatest successes. He was back on TV in 2016 withOzzy & Jack’s World Detour, which ran for three series, with Kelly joining her father and brother for the third in 2018.In 2003 Ozzy almost died aftercrashing his quad bikeat his estate in Buckinghamshire. While he was in hospital he topped the UK singles charts for the first time withChanges, a Black Sabbath song he had re-recorded as a duet with Kelly.In 2005 he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame as both solo artist and member of Black Sabbath, and the following year into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Black Sabbath. An album of cover versions, Under Cover (2005), was received unenthusiastically, but he was back to chartbusting ways with Black Rain (2007) and Scream (2010). The long-awaited Black Sabbath studio album,13, finally appeared in 2013.Memoirs of a Madman(2014) was a compilation of the best of Osbourne’s solo work. In 2015 he received the Ivor Novello award for lifetime achievement at a ceremony in London.View image in fullscreenOzzy and Sharon Osbourne in 2007.Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/ReutersIn 2016, Black Sabbath, including Ozzy, embarked on a year-long world tour, billed as the group’s swansong. However, it was overshadowed by further Osbourne family dramas. In May, news broke that Ozzy had moved out of the family home after 34 years of marriage. It emerged that he had been having a four-year relationship with Michelle Pugh, a hair stylist, and wasbeing treated for sex addiction. Ozzy made a public apology, saying that he was undergoing “intense therapy”.In 2019, he was forced to postpone his No More Tours 2 concerts in Europe after beinghospitalisedwith a respiratory infection. He was also diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, though this was notmade publicuntil 2020 (in 2005 he had been diagnosed with Parkin syndrome, a genetic condition which causes symptoms similar to Parkinson’s).In September 2019 he reached No 8 on the US singles charts with his performance on Post Malone’sTake What You Want, his first entry into the Top 10 since 1989. He released a well-received new solo album,Ordinary Man(2020), but cancelled planned north American shows to enable him to undergo treatment for Parkinson’s in Switzerland. In 2022 he released his 13th solo album,Patient Number 9.Earlier this month he gave his concert farewell at Villa Park, Birmingham as the finale of a day of metal music. A short set of solo songs was followed by another with his original Black Sabbath bandmates Iommi, Butler and Ward, ending with Paranoid.In 1971 he married Thelma Riley, and they had three children, Jessica, Louis and Elliot. Shortly after their divorce in 1982 he married Sharon. She survives him, along with the three children from each marriage.Ozzy (John Michael) Osbourne, singer and songwriter, born 3 December 1948; died 22 July 2025Explore more on these topicsOzzy OsbourneBlack SabbathMetalPop and rockReality TVMTVobituariesShareReuse this content"

Here it has amusingly brought back the Fantastic Four in their early years (but not to the very beginning) in a retro-futurist version of early 1960s New York where no one smokes. Hilariously, the Four are of course living together as a family in a bizarre hi-tech apartment, like something in TV’s Bewitched or I Dream of Jeannie, often wearing their comfy blue pyjama-style outfits.Scientist Dr Reed “Mr Fantastic” Richards, whose nickname rather oversells his peculiar superpower of stretchiness, is played by Pedro Pascal in a lighter vocal register than usual; he’s married to Sue “Invisible Woman” Storm – played by Vanessa Kirby. They are basically mom and dad to a couple of guys who are to all intents and purposes teen boys: Sue’s brother Johnny “Human Torch” Storm (played by Joseph Quinn) and superstrong Ben Grimm played byEbon Moss-Bachrach. They are essentially two grown men who live with Reed and Sue in a cheerfully infantilised state, and what complicates things is that Sue is now suddenly pregnant long after the couple had given up hoping. (There is apparently no IVF in this alt-reality universe.)So the question arises: will the baby have superpowers doubled, superpowers squared? Is that how it works? Or will it be a kind of bittersweet affliction like that stoically accepted by Ben Grimm? And talking of the consequences of love, Ben Grimm is poignantly in love with a local schoolteacher (Natasha Lyonne) who is maybe unwilling to overlook his granite appearance, and it looks very much as if Johnny is having some amorous chemistry with the Silver Surfer (Julia Garner) who arrives on Earth as the emissary of the colossally destructive Galactus (Ralph Ineson) – who says he might spare Planet Earth for a terrible price.The result hangs together as an entertaining spectacle in its own innocent self-enclosed universe of fantasy wackiness, where real people actually read the comic books that have made mythic legends of the real Four. I have expressed my dissatisfaction recently with superhero films which have to finish with AI cities collapsing – and, yes, this is what happens here, but at least this finale emerges from the established story premise, and works well with the tone of uncomplicated fun. (I was once in a minority for liking the nowall-but-forgotten Ioan Gruffudd iteration of Fantastic Fourfor very similar reasons.)There is much incidental fun to be had in luxuriating in the film’s hallucinatory 60s production design, down to the imaginary movies being shown in cinemas in Times Square: The Emperor’s Twin from Disney and an Alistair MacLean-type adventure called Subzero Intel. Then when the baby is born, Ben Grimm earnestly brandishes his copy of Dr Benjamin Spock’s Baby and Child Care, a permissive book which conservatives were later to blame for raising a generation of undisciplined slackers. Certainly, Kirby’s Sue Storm looks very good for a sleep-deprived new mother with no childcare staff other than one small goggle-eyed robot. As for paterfamilias Reed, he always wears his tie, though sometimes tucks it into his shirt. Overall a very silly movie – though it’s keeping the superhero genre aloft.The Fantastic Four: First Steps is out on 24 July in Australia and the UK and on 25 July in the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmSuperhero moviesAction and adventure filmsMarvelPedro PascalVanessa KirbyEbon Moss-BachrachreviewsShareReuse this content"

Many nutritional methods have proven to help chronic inflammation, too – such as eating avegetable-heavy Mediterranean dietor morewhole grainsandomega-3-rich fish.Butcostandaccess issuescan get in the way of these solutions. Plus, they may not address a major root cause, asincreasingevidencesays chronic stress can induce chronic inflammation.To prevent and manage chronic stress, more health professionals are offering “social prescriptions”, or referrals to non-medical, community-based, de-stressing activities. Often, these activities are free or the costs are covered by another party, like an insurer or local non-profit.I tried an anti-inflammatory diet for a week. This is what I learnedRead moreDr Alan Siegel, executive director of non-profitSocial Prescribing USAand a family physician at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, has prescribed community walks, painting classes and museum visits to his patients for over two decades. “Whether somebody walks into my office with type 2 diabetes or depression, I’ve seen how social prescriptions can help patients truly heal and adopt healthier lifestyles in the long-term.”More than 30 countriesand adozen US stateshave social prescribing programs, which have led toimproved healthandreduced pressure on healthcare.But even without a doctor’s note or a thick wallet, anyone can engage in these scientifically backed anti-inflammatory activities.What is inflammation?Inflammation – the body’s evolutionary response to infection, injury, or other threats – has been a trending topic in the health world. Some scientists have evencalled inflammation“the cause of all diseases”. But what actually causesinflammation, and what fights it?In some contexts, inflammation is good. When the body faces an acute threat – say, an ear infection or a sprained ankle – it responds with acute inflammation, an immune system process marked by fever, swelling and pain in the affected area.But in the face of chronic threats – say, from trauma or job stress – acute inflammation can also become chronic, and the immune, stress and cardiometabolic responses can become dysregulated. Research links chronic inflammation withlow mood,cognitive impairment,cardiovascular risksand a range of mental health conditions includingdepression and dementia.Spend time in natureForest-bathing – engaging in natural environments with all five senses – is a knownwellbeing booster. But according to Dr Qing Li, professor of clinical medicine at Nippon Medical school in Tokyo, forest bathing can also help support healthy functioning of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, a key player in controlling the stress and inflammation response.“Forest environments can promote relaxation and activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the ‘rest and digest’ functions,” says Dr Li. It can also reduce activity in the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the “fight or flight” responses. By helping to prevent and manage stress, forest bathing can also help prevent and manage chronic inflammation.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, 'Well Actually', then 'Read more on living a good life in a complex world,' then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say 'More from this section'Aseries of Li’s studiesshow that forest bathing can reduce the stress hormones cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenaline. Otherresearchsimilarly finds time in nature can reduce physiological markers of stress, like cortisol, and the perception of stress. Onestudyfound just 20 minutes of nature per day can make a difference in stress levels.Engage with art and musicArt can also promote relief from chronic stress. In onestudy, healthy adults who participated in a 45-minute art-making session saw significantly lower levels of cortisol afterward.Feelings of stress arerelated to a loss of control, says Dr Girija Kaimal, professor of creative arts therapies at Drexel University, who co-authored the study. Creating art helps us feel like “there’s something we have a sense of agency over” and “lets us take charge of the distress”.The study’s participants self-reported that they found art-making relaxing, enjoyable, “freeing from constraints”, and conducive toflowand self-discovery. “Distraction is a great initial coping mechanism to help us calm down after a stressful event, but art can help us dig deeper – it helps us pay attention to what distressed us, and it’ll help the next time something similar sets us off,” says Kaimal.It’s important to create “the kind of art that speaks to you,” says Kaimal – whether it’s writing, dancing, or drawing – and skill level doesn’t matter. “You want to get into a judgment-free zone where you can play and have fun without consequences.”A growing body of research suggests experiencing art, not just creating it, can also promote inflammation reduction.Someresearchhas found listening to music, for instance, can reduce blood pressure and cortisol. Researchers at the University of Florida have been documenting thehealth benefits of engaging with the arts, with some studies suggesting just one to three hours of related activity per week can reduce risk of depression and cognitive decline.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective because bodily movement was often linked with fighting a predator or fighting for our lives, says Dr Michael Gleeson, emeritus professor of exercise biochemistry at Loughborough University. “The body puts its survival first,” and temporarily inhibits the inflammatory response so it can use energy more efficiently, he says.In his co-authoredresearch, Gleeson suggests exercise not only induces an anti-inflammatory environment in the short-term, but may also reduce visceral fat mass in the long-term. The accumulation of visceral fat can drive and worsen chronic inflammation by promoting development of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and other diseases linked to physical inactivity.Other research finds that exercise can significantly reduce production ofpro-inflammatory proteins, such as CRP and IL-6, and increaseanti-inflammatory proteins, such as IL-10.To reap these and other benefits, the World Health Organizationrecommendsadults spend at least 150 minutes each week on moderate aerobic activity, such as brisk walking and cycling, or 75 minutes on vigorous activity, such as running, Zumba or sports. A longitudinalstudyfinds sports involving social interaction – such as tennis, badminton and soccer – are best at promoting health and longevity.Support other peopleBecause cooperation with others has historically been essential for survival, our bodies have evolved to respond to the absence of social connections. Thelate neuroscientist Dr John Cacioppocompares this evolutionary response to hunger. Just as hunger signals the absence of energy and nutrients and cues the body to find food, loneliness signals the absence of social connections, and cues us to seek out or repair relationships.What is metabolic syndrome – and do we really need to worry about it?Read moreThat’s why multiple studies link feelings of loneliness and social isolation to arange of stress responses, including increasedpro-inflammatory proteinsand dysregulatedcortisolfunction.Conversely, studies linkhigh levels of social supportto lower cortisol, and link social activities likevolunteeringandgiving social supportto lower pro-inflammatory proteins.Experience ‘awe’Within all of these activities, the experience of awe – a feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends our current understanding of the world – can also reduce inflammation.Dr Jennifer Stellar, a professor of psychology at University of Toronto, co-authored astudythat links awe to greater positive affect and lower inflammatory proteins.Further research is underway but Stellar suggests “that positive emotions can undo the effects of negative emotions, and negative emotions are associated with inflammation”. Another reason is that “awe makes us feel connected to others, and social connection has been documented to act as a buffer against inflammatory responses.”So how can you encounter awe? Her co-author, Dr Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at University of Berkeley California and renowned awe expert,saysthat it can result from engagement with the “eight wonders of life”: the moral beauty of others, nature, collective movement, music, visual design, spirituality and religion, big ideas, and the cycle of life and death.Julia Hotz is a solutions-focused journalist and award-winning author ofTheConnectionCureExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyUS healthcareHealthMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Composite: Guardian Design/ReutersThe tiny, astonishingly wealthy country has become a major player on the world stage, trying to solve some of the most intractable conflicts. What’s driving this project?ByNesrine MalikTue 22 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Jul 2025 05.56 EDTShareOn the morning of Friday 13 June, a few hours after Israel launched a volley of missiles towards Tehran, one of Donald Trump’s first calls was to the emir of Qatar. Trump hoped that Sheikh Tamim could persuade the president of Iran, Masoud Pezeshkian, to engage in a negotiated solution. Pezeshkian refused. Iran would be willing to talk, but would not negotiate under fire.Over the next few days, during what has since come to be known as the “12 -day war”, the Qataris spoke regularly to President Trump and the Iranian leadership. “We were busy,” a senior Qatari diplomat told me, with some understatement. The risks to the region were high, but toQatarthey were “existential”, he said. Qatar is a tiny country. Most of its immense wealth comes from the undersea gasfield that it shares with nearby Iran, and the two nations enjoy good relations. At the same time, Qatar is a close ally of Iran’s greatest enemy, the US, and hosts the largest US military base in the region. If the US became involved in the war, Qatar would become a target.Qatari officials immediately started looking, as the diplomat put it, “for ways to lower the temperature”. But on 22 June, the US struck three nuclear facilities inIran. For the Qatari establishment, this escalation was a nightmare scenario. Yet within 48 hours, the conflict was over – and Qatar played a critical role in bringing it to an end.On 23 June, Iran launched missiles towards Qatar, targeting al Udeid airbase, where 10,000 US troops are stationed. It was the first time modern Qatar had ever come under military attack. “I can’t believe this is Qatar,” said one panicked resident, in a video shared with me of the missiles loudly passing over her garden in Doha, the capital city.Although residents of Doha were not forewarned, the strike was a carefully choreographed affair between Iran, the US and Qatar. Hours before the attack, Iran had informed the Americans that missiles would be fired at al Udeid. The Americans, in turn, briefed the Qataris, who closed their airspace in anticipation. Fourteen missiles in total were discharged, and all bar one were intercepted by Qatari defence forces. (The other landed in al Udeid but caused no casualties.) Qatar condemned the attack but did not retaliate. By allowing Iran a face-saving strike on US assets, Qatar “took one for the team to allow for de-escalation”, said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a Middle East specialist at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.After the strike on al Udeid, Trump once again leant on the Qataris for help. In a call to the emir, Trump explained thatIsraelhad agreed to a US ceasefire proposal – now he wanted the Qataris to help convince the Iranians to sign up to it. On 24 June, the Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, secured Iran’s agreement to end hostilities. Qatar had helped to snatch peace from the jaws of war. It was an “upsetting” episode, the Qatari diplomat told me, and it was not “cost-free”. But even as the Qataris privately seethed at the strike’s disruption to its airspace and the way the missiles had unsettled its populace, in public the Qatari prime minister was calling for diplomacy.Qatar is a rich country with a poor man’s mindset, a powerful country with a weak one’s vigilance. Its focus on diplomacy is an effort to shore up its fragile position, as a small nation in a volatile region, surrounded by swaggering players such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iran. Its population isaround 3 million, of whomabout 13% are Qatari. (The non-Qatari population is largely comprised of migrant workers from the Arab world, the Indian subcontinent and the Philippines.) Wealth is concentrated in the small Qatari citizenry, who over the past 20 years have become the richest in the world. But all that wealth still cannot buy security. After I joked with one senior Qatari official about how hard they all seemed to be working, he responded with a weary seriousness. It would be great if they could all go home and enjoy the country’s prosperity, he said. “But we can’t afford to.”And so, slowly, quietly, Qatar has made itself into the diplomatic capital of the world. Over the past year, I have spoken to more than two dozen sources, including senior Qatari government officials, western diplomats, local and foreign academics, residents and parties to negotiations mediated by Qatar. Over these conversations, and two trips to Doha, what emerged was a picture of a small country in a sprint to fill a big and rapidly growing role: global middleman. Dotted across Doha are the many palaces and offices that have hosted, over recent years, negotiations for the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, the return of Ukrainian children fromRussia, the return of US hostages from Iran, the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and, earlier this year, a brief ceasefire in Gaza.As of July 2025, Qatar is running 10 active mediations, some hosted in Doha, others abroad. On 28 June, Qatari officials were in Washington DC at the signing of a peace treaty between the Democratic Republic of the Congo andRwanda, the result of negotiations that Qatar had initiated earlier this year. A week later, I spoke to Dr Mohammed bin Abdulaziz al-Khulaifi, Qatari minister of state and chief mediator, a man with a dizzying travel schedule. After attending the peace treaty signing in DC, he had travelled to Venezuela, where Qatar has been acting as intermediary between the US and Venezuela as they discuss prisoner swaps and tussle over the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. A few hours after our conversation, Al-Khulaifi was poised to receive an Israeli delegation in Doha to start a new round of talks with Hamas. “Whenever there is a conflict or a crisis, you will see us,” he said, ushering people “to the negotiating table.”View image in fullscreenQatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani meeting with Rwandan leader Paul Kagame, left, DRC president Felix Tshisekedi in Doha in March.Photograph: Mofa Qatar/AFP/Getty ImagesThe power Qatar has come to wield has taken many observers by surprise. As a conservative Muslim monarchy in the Middle East, Qatar is a new kind of location for the sort of high-stakes geopolitical deal-making transacted until recently in Geneva and Oslo. Yet since 7 October, the precarious nation’s investment in becoming the world’s go-between has come into its own. Having long cultivated close relations with both the US and Hamas, Qatar became the locus of ceasefire negotiations, as well as discussions over aid and evacuating the wounded. And as the conflict expanded into the wider Middle East and drew in the US, Qatar’s mediation has grown from a strategy to enhance its own safety into a role that underpins the entire world’s security.As an independent nation, Qatar is only 54 years old. In its first decades after the end of the British protectorate in 1971, Qatar was synonymous with nothing at all: not the oil riches and religious power of Saudi Arabia, nor the construction boom of Dubai, nor the cultural and political reach of Egypt and Syria. In the 70s and 80s, white collar workers from across the Arab world migrated to the oil-rich economies of the Gulf. Few went to Qatar. Its ruling family, the Al-Thanis, had no profile. The country was seen as little more than a vassal of its larger neighbour Saudi Arabia. The first time many in the region even saw the Doha skyline was when the TV channel Al Jazeera launched in 1996. The Doha Sheraton, a lone squat building on the coastline, was all there was.Then in the 90s, Qatar struck gas and everything changed. The South Pars/North Dome, which partly lies in Iranian waters, is the world’s largest natural gas field. Within a matter of years, Qatar became the world’s leading exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG), and its sovereign wealth exploded. During this same period, the Qatar we know today was taking shape. In 1995, Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani carried out a palace coup against his father, banishing him from Qatar until the early 2000s. Whereas his father had been happy for Qatar to remain subordinate to Saudi Arabia, the new emir had bigger ambitions.The year after the coup, Al Jazeera was launched. In contrast to the deferential approach of state-controlled news media across the region, Al Jazeera took Arab political discourse out of the street and on to the airwaves, challenging orthodoxies, poking at sectarian tensions and antagonising other Arab governments. When Sheikh Hamad came to power, a person affiliated with Al Jazeera told me “he had a strategy of putting Qatar on the world stage”. The new channel was part of that plan.While Qatar used the new channel to spread its cultural reach regionally, through the Qatar Investment Authority it expanded its financial power even further. In Britain, the country that once ruled over it, Qatari state institutions and private entities amassed a £100bn propertyportfolio, scooping up Chelsea Barracks in 2007, the Shard in 2009 and Harrods in 2010. In France, it acquired Paris Saint-Germain football club in 2011; in the US, Miramax studios in 2016; and in the same year, the iconic Asia Square Tower 1 in Singapore.Its most audacious move, during this period, wassecuring the 2022 World Cup. As it prepared for the tournament, after winning hosting rights in 2010, Qatar wasaccused of subjecting migrant labourersworking on construction facilities to conditions, particularly heat exposure, that caused hundreds of deaths. A2021 Guardian investigationfound that 6,500 workers had died in the previous decade. (Qatar responded with a dogged insistence that the criticism was simply unfounded, but nevertheless implemented labour reforms.) The tournament itself went off smoothly, and so elevated the nation’s global status that the Qatari prime minister described it as “Qatar’s IPO”.The home of all these epic manifestations of financial power and political determination is a relatively subdued place. One can visit Doha many times, as I have over the past 15 years, and never feel you break into the heart of the country. Its centrepiece is not a skyscraper like Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, but a refurbished historical market of shops, cafes and performance areas where locals, tourists and expats mix. Evenings are quiet. And for such a small place, it can feel strangely cavernous.On a recent visit, I often felt like an awkward Little Lord Fauntleroy – sipping carrot juice in an almost entirely empty hotel lobby, or sampling a colossal breakfast buffet with so few other takers I began to think about the vast quantities that would soon be thrown away. In Doha, one is rarely in the slipstream of a crowd, apart from in the foothills of a mall, where shoppers wait for their chauffeured cars and Ubers. The few hundred thousand Qataris in Doha float above the fray, an identifiable upper class, the men in white and the women in black.View image in fullscreenQatar’s prime minister and foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani (4th left) watches Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud speak at a UN security council meeting regarding Israel and Hamas alongside senior polticians from Egypt, Turkey, Palestinian Authority and Jordan.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPAThe contrast between Doha and its attention-grabbing neighbours is instructive. To the east is Dubai, which is far livelier but more like a park for the global super-rich. To the west is the Saudi capital, Riyadh, which is now open late, jettisoning religious convention on gender mingling, and courting the global fashion and entertainment elite, but still finessing how that sits with its traditional core. As they undergo profound transformations, these places feel somewhat uncertain of themselves. What is striking about Doha, and Qatar in general, is that rapid change has not been accompanied by the same identity crisis. It is conservative without being hardline (alcohol is tightly regulated for personal consumption but available in hotel bars), Qatari women are prominent in senior government roles but always in demure and modest dress. With its wealthy, small and religiously monolithic Sunni population, Qatar has no fears of revolution. “As much as we like to emphasise some of their vulnerabilities,” says Allen Fromherz, director of the Middle East Studies Center at Georgia State University, “I also think they are in a uniquely politically stable situation vis-a-vis their own population.”This is perhaps why the Qataris are more comfortable turning Doha into a place where people come together to talk. The Qatar Economic Forum and the Doha Debates, two annual gatherings that make up a sort of Davos on the Persian Gulf, have been going for more than 20 years,and temporarily turn parts of the city into a hub of chatter and activity. There are limitations to the image the Qataris seek to project. Discourse is turned outwards, with Qatar as a sort of backdrop to global discourse, its own shortcomings and political decisions left uninterrogated within its borders.Being a small nation, Qatar’s identity is largely defined by its political establishment. In a 2021 interview, the emir described Qatar as having two roles: “energy provider and peace facilitator”. The former is an asset deposited by virtue of geological fortune, but the latter is a concerted choice by the country’s leadership and pursued with increasingly single-minded determination.Diplomacy is central to how Qatar sees itself. Its 2003 constitution explicitly states that Qatari foreign policy “is based on the principle of strengthening international peace and security by means of encouraging peaceful resolution of international disputes”. Spending time with Qatari officials over the past few months, I got the impression of a political establishment that seemed excited by the fact that an abstract policy pledge made more than 20 years ago had now become real. “This is a job that not many people do,” minister of state Al-Khulaifi told me. “Sometimes we feel like we are doctors, trying to develop the right solution for the most complicated cases, trying to offer them the medicine they need.”The rewards Qatar seeks from this work are not immediate, tangible ones. They’re not looking for investment opportunities, access to raw materials or a say in what happens after a deal is agreed. “They don’t ask anything from the participants,” said one source who had recently been involved in a Qatari-brokered mediation process. The source’s counterpart on the other side echoed his comments: “All they wanted was to be recognised as a player.” The fruits of the brokering – building status and trust, which in turn deepen international influence and relationships – are the prize.The top team that deals with global crises is small enough that they could all fit into an SUV. It includes the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, along with Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, who is both prime minister and foreign minister, and Al-Khulaifi, minister of state for mediation, disputes and conflict resolutions. According to one person familiar with negotiation arrangements, the emir often phones leaders personally to persuade them to start a mediation. This is how Qatar managed to getPaul Kagame, president of Rwanda, to fly to Doha in March to take part in peace negotiations with the DRC. Even when the emir is not in the meeting rooms, he is on an instant messaging hotline to those who are, and weighs in on big decisions.“The Qataris play different roles at different points,” says Sansom Milton, co-author ofa new bookabout the rise of Qatar as a conflict mediator. The first role is go-between: using its ability to talk to all parties in order to pass messages between often bitter antagonists. The second is persuader: convincing people to come together to hammer out an agreement.The third role is facilitator: that is, hosting the different parties and providing other services. Once at the table, according to one source with first-hand knowledge of the process, Qatari mediators often finesse and re-craft messages passed between negotiating teams, taking the edge off provocative language or unreasonable demands.View image in fullscreenQueen Elizabeth II meets with the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim, at Windsor Castle, May 2022.Photograph: Steve Parsons/PAUnderpinning all of this work – as go-between, persuader, facilitator – is Qatar’s role as a funder. Milton mentioned the way, in 2020, the Qataris were able “to fly in 400 Taliban delegates to Doha at short notice” to work on the final stages of the agreement for the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Ten years earlier, Qatar helped convince rebels in Darfur to talk to the Sudanese government by promising hundreds of millions of dollars in post-peace agreement aid. One of the benefits of being an absolute monarchy with limitless wealth is that vast sums can be spent without having to clear lengthy bureaucratic or administrative hurdles.Ask senior Qataris about the roots of their diplomatic work, and they will often refer to the country’s historical status as an underdog. Situated in a particularly harsh and dry patch of desert, for centuries all Qatar had to offer was shelter for groups that had been ostracised elsewhere, including political refugees and exiles. Qatar’s founding father, Jassim bin Mohammed al-Thani, famously referred to Qatar as “the Kaaba of the Dispossessed”, in reference to the stone building in Mecca’s Masjid al-Haram (Great Mosque), the destination of Muslim pilgrimage. Two hundred years later, that phrase was repeated by almost every person I spoke to as a distillation of Qatar’s ethos. According to this view, Qatar’s small size and awkward location are weaknesses that produced its greatest strength: an ability not just to ingratiate itself with the powerful, but also to identify with, and gain the trust of, the weak.As with any national story, Qatar’s is partly a product of selective memory, wishful thinking, calculated PR strategy and so on. But a variety of sources across the political spectrum, including a US state department official, a Palestinian activist, and a western image-making consultant – each of whom had worked closely with the Qataris – all suggested that there is a perhaps surprising degree of principle and sincerity to Qatar’s politics. Azzam Tamimi, a Palestinian historian of Hamas who spent time with its political leadership in Doha, told me that even though Palestinians began seeking refuge all over the Middle East and Arabian Gulf after the Nakba in 1948, Qatar had a certain “extra empathy” with Palestinians that endured and extended into financial support for the Hamas government inGaza, and refusal to normalise relations with Israel.That position has not precluded engagement with Israel. In October 2024, Gershon Baskin, an Israeli political activist withextensive experienceof negotiating with Hamas travelled to Qatar independently to work on a hostage release proposal. Initially, he said, he was “suspicious” of the Qataris, but found them to be “serious” and “sincere” in their efforts to bring about peace. He also said he was surprised, on checking in to his hotel, the Waldorf Astoria in Doha, to find Yossi Cohen, the former head of the Mossad, sitting in the lobby “with a group of businessmen”. It was a moment that revealed to him that Qatar’s role is not a binary one of simple loyalty to Hamas and enmity towards Israel, but something “more complex”.Qatar’s sharp focus on diplomacy is partly the product of years of bitter conflict. In the 2010s, after long adhering to wider regional consensus, Qatar began to actively antagonise its neighbours. The trigger was the Arab spring. When the revolutions began, Sheikh Hamad was 15 years into his tenure as emir. Like many of his generation, growing up in the 1950s and 60s, he was inspired by the pan-Arabism of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, whose charisma, fierce opposition to Israel and vision of the Arabs as a proud bloc of peoples united by their shared histories made him a regional icon. To Sheikh Hamad, the Arab spring protests evoked an old longing for self-determination that had been repressed for decades. Under his leadership, Qatar broke ranks with the other powers in the region by siding with the protesters, backing the revolution in Egypt, Syria, Tunisia and Libya.Al Jazeera’s role in covering the Arab spring, which began in December 2010 in Tunisia, was central to this effort. Hugh Miles, the author of an authoritative book on Al Jazeera, told me that although the network is not a state broadcaster, it is “completely owned and controlled by the Qataris”, and its Arabic channel is often used to “advance their foreign policy positions”. Al Jazeera, he added, gave Qatar “enormous influence through the Arab spring”. The channel beamed footage of raging protests, vox pops and excited analysis to hundreds of millions across the region. In early 2011, graffiti scrawled on a Cairo wall captured the three forces that many saw as stoking the revolution: “Twitter, Facebook, Al Jazeera”. In February 2011, Egyptian protesters in Tahrir Square chanted “Long live Al Jazeera”. A week later, President Mubarak resigned.The party around which revolutionary passions coalesced was the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, a longstanding opponent of established Arab regimes, and in June 2012, it won the first post-revolution election in Egypt. In just one year, the Qatari government offered President Mohamed Morsi’s government almost $8bn-worth of hard currency bank deposits, loans, and natural gas. This level of support merely deepened an existing relationship. In 1961, a prominent Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader, Yusuf al-Qaradawi, was exiled to Qatar, where he developed close relations with the royal family. Al-Qaradawi was a popular televangelist and household name across the Arab World, as well as a controversial figure in the west, where he was banned from entry by, among others, the UK and the US for endorsement of suicide bombings in Palestinian occupied territories and attacks on American soldiers in Iraq. “The Brotherhood”, said Fromherz, who taught at Qatar University in the late 2000s, was “institutionalised” in Qatar. “Qaradawi received Qatari citizenship; his daughter was my dean.”View image in fullscreenRussia’s president, Vladimir Putin, greets Qatar’s Sheikh Tamim at the Kremlin, Moscow, in April.Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/EPAIn June 2013, Prince Tamim took power in Qatar from his father in a peaceful transition. As a young emir, only 33 at the time he ascended to the throne, he could not be seen to be breaking with his father’s policies, a source close to the ruling family told me. That would have been to discredit Sheikh Hamad. So Tamim initially followed his father’s ethos. During the Arab spring, “We stood by the people,”Tamim told60 Minutes. “They [Saudi Arabia and UAE] stood by the regimes. I feel that we stood by the right side.” After the military coup that toppled Morsi’s government in July 2013, Al Jazeera was the only regional channel that followed, live, the Muslim Brotherhood’s protests and gave airtime to others critical of regimes in the region. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt were infuriated by what they saw as Qatar’s continued efforts to threaten their stability, as well as its continued close relations with Iran.After years of threats, regional tensions came to a head in the summer of 2017. On 5 June, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Yemen, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic ties with Qatar. Qatari vessels were prohibited from utilising air, land and sea across the Arabian Gulf and Egypt. Saudi Arabia closed off Qatar’s only land crossing. Meanwhile, Saudi and the UAE had mobilised troops and were poised to invade. “We felt that we had Trump by our side,” a Saudi source told the BBC, “so let’s finish this little country that’s been bugging us for years.” Only a last-minute intervention by US secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who knew the Al-Thanis well from his days as an executive at ExxonMobil, saved Qatar. Saudi and the UAE backed down, but the blockade continued. (Last year, in homage to the nation’s saviour, Qatar named its first conventional LNG carrierRex Tillerson.)Qatar was able to weather the blockade. One Doha resident recalled how, in-mid June 2017, it had seemed like all was lost: supermarket shelves had been emptied and there was little hope of replenishment. And then suddenly, they were full, this time with produce written in an unfamiliar language. Turkey had stepped in to fill the gap. “Süt,” the resident said, was a Turkish word that Qatari residents came to learn meant not just “milk”, but salvation. In the months that followed, Qatar flew in thousands of cows fromEurope, Australia and California, shepherding them down the ramp of Qatar Airways airbuses. Qatar also began investing in its own food production. Before the blockade, 72% of Qatar’s dairy was imported. In November 2019, it made its first dairy export.The blockade lasted almost four years, and Qatar emerged in 2021 having learned some important lessons. First, making big political plays in the open was a mistake: the parties that it very publicly supported during the Arab spring had been eviscerated, and the cost of alienating its neighbours was high. Second, the soft power of mediation, already a feature of its politics, needed to become central to how Qatar presented itself to the world. Third, it would no longer appear to pick sides. It would be a mediator for everyone. And fourth, Qatar needed to make itself indispensable to the nation that saved it from being swallowed by its larger neighbours. In 2017, Qatar was lucky that Tillerson occupied such a powerful position in an otherwise hostile Trump administration. If there was a next time, Qatar’s fate would not be left to chance.Qatar’s success in winning over the US can be summed up in two statements by Trump, almost exactly eight years apart. In June 2017, Trump tweeted, “During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar – look!” In May 2025, Trump became the first US president to make an official visit to Qatar. “Congratulations on a spectacular job,” he said to the emir in a speech. “Let us give thanks for the blessings of this friendship. It’s an honour to be with you.”The shift is the product of a concerted campaign. More than any other nation in the Gulf, Qatar is totally reliant on the US security umbrella. On a smaller scale, it seems to be approaching the Israeli model: a state with insecure borders that has sought to fortify itself by becoming a vital part of US security interests. The key part of this strategy is, without doubt, al Udeid airbase. It was built in 1996 at a cost of $1bn, after a joint military agreement between the US and Qatar, but it expanded over the years, most dramatically in 2018. Only 18 miles from Doha, it is discreet and self-sufficient, with a large shopping mall thatstocks everythingfrom protein bars to pork products. In May 2025, Qatari pledged to invest another $10bn. That cost includes everything from construction of runways, hangars, barracks and housing facilities to their maintenance and modernisation.This is a big investment, even for Qatar, but its true value is incalculable. Any attack on Qatar puts American troops in the line of fire and threatens what has become the headquarters for US Central Command for the entire Middle East region. Al Udeid was the centre of “Operation Roundup”, which dismantled Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Along with US troops, the base also houses hundreds of Nato troops.In addition to al Udeid – which a Qatari official made sure to remind me was a Qatari base that hosts foreign troops, rather than a foreign base on Qatari soil – since 2017, Qatar has done two key things to ingratiate itself with the US: with its diplomatic work, it has strived to show what a useful ally it can be in a turbulent world. At the same time, it has assiduously wooed the American financial and political elite. In both cases, it has spent a lot of money doing so. Ben Freeman, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, who focuses on foreign lobbying in the United States, told me that less than a decade ago, Qatar was “an afterthought”, as far as US foreign policy went. Today, it is “riding high”.In the summer of 2017, to counter more established UAE and Saudi lobbying networks, Qatar moved quickly. “Literally, within days, if not hours, after the blockade began,” Freeman told me, “they really go on this spending spree.” By 2018, according to analysis ofForeign Agents Registration Act records, 33 entities, including firms and individuals, were representing Qatari interests.Qatar made sure to connect with Republicans close to Trump. In 2019, it hired Pam Bondi, Trump’s current attorney general, to provideconsulting services. In 2021, shortly after he left his position under the previous Trump administration, Qatar hired Kash Patel, current director of the FBI, to provide consulting services. In March 2025, Qatar hired US lobbying firm Cornerstone Government Affairs. Working on Qatar’s account are David Planning, a former special assistant to Trump, and Chris Hodgson, a former aide to former vice-president Mike Pence.Since 2023, the Qatar Investment Authority has ploughedhundreds of millions of dollarsintoJared Kushner’s investment company. In 2023, Qatar also spent more than $600m buying out Steve Witkoff and his partners’ investment in atroubled development project. Witkoff is now Trump’s Middle East envoy, and earlier this year gave an interview to Tucker Carlson in which he spoke effusively about the Qataris’ mediation work and described Sheikh Mohammed, the prime minister, as “a special guy”. Most famously, in May of this year, Trump was offered a $400m jet dubbed “a palace in the sky”. (Again, a Qatari official was at pains to remind me that it is a government-to-government transaction, rather than a personal gift.)View image in fullscreenSheikh Tamim welcoming Donald Trump to Doha in May.Photograph: Qatar News Agency Handout/EPAMeanwhile, Qatar continues to spend lavishly on US military equipment. In terms of foreign military sales, as distinct from military aid, Qatar isthe US’s second largestpartner in the world. (Thelargest is Poland, the US’s security partner against Russian aggression along the eastern flank of Nato.)The transformation in Qatar’s relationship with the US – and the methods through which this has been achieved – have not gone unnoticed. Qatar’s mediating role between Israel and Hamas has triggered even more scrutiny, with one American outlet raising concerns over whether an “Islamic safe haven” could be “pulling the strings” in Washington and “buying America”. Anotherprominent US media outletcalled for shutting down and relocating al Udeid, because the base served as an “effective means for convincing American policymakers to ignore [Qatar’s] mischief” as a “state sponsor of terrorism”. Witkoff has came under fire for his closeness to Qatar, and has responded by fiercely re-stating his pro-Israel credentials. “I am no Qatari sympathiser,” he told the Atlantic.The accusations of being motivated by Islamic extremism or an anti-Israel agenda are, one Qatari source said, “a headache”. (Hamas opened an office in Doha in 2012. The Qataris assert this wasnot an endorsement, but the result of a request from the United States, which wished to establish a line of communication with Hamas.) Qatari leaders are confident that actions speak louder than words, and that they are proving their credentials as an honest broker. According to one senior Qatari official, the emir’s instruction to them when coming under “baseless criticism” is “close your ears. Focus on the main task and ignore them.”In a world of accelerating conflicts and, under Trump, increasingly transactional foreign policy, Qatar now finds itself in a position where there is more appetite for its services than it can handle. Al-Khulaifi, the chief mediator, told me that Qatar is now receiving several requests for mediation – three in June alone – rather than initiating them. Majed Al-Ansari, adviser to the prime minister and spokesperson for the foreign ministry, told me that it’s an asset to have a small executive team, as Qatar does, because it means decision-making is quick.But there are limitations to this setup. One US negotiator spoke of a “capacity” issue. It is common for senior Qatari officials to have more than one position, and demands on them have sharply increased. The emir, one senior Qatari official told me, seems to have aged 20 years in the last two. Al-Ansari and Al-Khulaifi told me that Qatar is in the process of expanding its mediating sector: hiring more people, employing experts and creating joint ventures with European mediators such as Norway. There is a desire, said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, to rely less on the “personal relationships and Rolodex” of the leadership.Qatar’s small size and big role means that sometimes matters have to be outsourced, which has led to political fallout. Earlier this year, two close advisers to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu were arrested for taking money to promote Qatar’s image within Israel, resulting in what came to be known as Qatargate, a scandal that engulfed the Israeli government and security establishment. Qatari officials claim that the arrangement with the Israelis was secured, without their involvement, via a third party – a lobbying firm in the US tasked with burnishing Qatar’s reputation abroad. The Qataris say that the whole affair has become supercharged because of the war in Gaza and Israel’s polarised domestic politics, and because of a kneejerk mistrust of Qatar. Still, no country wants its name before a “gate”. And if the whole episode was indeed the result of a lobbying drive on which the Qataris had no oversight, that also suggests there isn’t enough capacity to manage Qatar’s expanding role in foreign affairs.The various Qatari officials I spent time with oscillated, sometimes in the same breath, between self-assurance and humility. They were enthused, proud, even a touch evangelical about Qatar’s success in what they often referred to as “sadd al-fajwa”, meaning “closing the gap”, between belligerents. At the same time, they constantly restated the limits – sometimes plaintively, other times with a hint of frustration – of what a mediating power can actually achieve. It can’t exert pressure on parties and it can’t force people to agree if they don’t want to. They were aware of Qatar’s growing stature as a global political player, and yet constrained by what they see as the hallmark of a good mediator: never making it about yourself.How Qatar bought up BritainRead more“Statecraft,” observed Middle East expert Andreas Krieg, “is about generating power or generating influence. Mediation is only good as a means of statecraft when you can extract influence from it.” Qatar has generated a lot of that power in recent months. Now it must deploy it not only to maintain its own safety, but global stability. The world has changed too quickly, too unexpectedly, and Qatar’s role in it is now bigger than it ever bargained for.On 21 July, I spoke to an official with knowledge of the ceasefire discussions between Israel and Hamas. The previous day in Gaza had been particularly bloody: 93 people waiting for food had been killed by Israeli forces. Tense talks had stretched into their third week without breakthrough, but also without breakdown. Two buildings, a 10-minute drive apart, housed the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators, who had been briefing aggressively against each other in the international press. The Qataris shuttled between them, late into the night, ears closed, eyes on the prize.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Sizewell C must hit budget firstNils PratleyCustomers face higher bills if project backed by the National Wealth Fund suffers serious cost overrunsUK strikes £38bn nuclear deal with private investorsTue 22 Jul 2025 13.41 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Jul 2025 14.50 EDTShareWelcome to “a new golden age” for nuclear power, saidEd Miliband, the energy secretary, as he signed off the £38bn (if we’re lucky) Sizewell C mega-plant in Suffolk. It will certainly look golden from the point of view of Centrica. The owner of British Gas is investing £1.3bn for a 15% equity stake in Sizewell on terms that look attractive for it.Centrica’s explanation of the mechanics behind Sizewell’s financing were more helpful than the government’s because it demonstrated how far ministers have had to go to attract private investors for a project that was once advertised to cost £20bn.In short, Centrica reckons it will make an internal rate of return above 12% if Sizewell arrives at £40bn (all the numbers being in 2024 prices). But the revealing part was what happens if costs overrun and the construction bill ends up at £47.7bn. In that case, the company’s rate of return will still come in above 10%. That is in nominal terms, so one has to knock off inflation, but it’s still a decent number. And – critically – it is as low as it could go. After £47.7bn, taxpayers or billpayers are on the hook.Chris O’Shea, Centrica’s chief executive, called the terms “acceptable” and the stock market agreed. Centrica’s shares rose 4% and analysts at Jefferies noted “robust protections”. The Canadian group, La Caisse, with a 20% stake, and the UK’s Amber Infrastructure (7.6%) are the other investors alongside the state itself (44.9%) and French developer EDF (12.5%).It is hard to believe HM Treasury imagined even a couple of years ago it would have to be quite so generous to attract private sector investors. That, unfortunately, is the reality of higher government borrowing costs. It all flows into the financing of big projects. So does the experience of overruns and delays atHinkley Point C, the plant in Somerset that is due to come on stream in the 2030s. So does the need to lock in investors for years.The option of carving out private investors entirely at Sizewell was a nonstarter: you need somebody to be incentivised to hold management’s feet to the fire in the hope of landing close to the headline £38bn. Centrica, as the 20% owner of the UK’s nuclear fleet, is as good as any for that task (even if it’s not clear what La Caisse and Amber offer). It’s just that the private sector has said, in effect, that it would accept some of the risk of cost overruns – but not too much and not to a degree that would seriously eat into returns.Meanwhile, the state is providing most of the debt, which is the greater part of the overall funding package, to the tune of £36bn to be channelled through the misleadingly named National Wealth Fund. In essence, this is a big heave from the government to make Sizewell happen.What does it mean for consumers? Well, a £1-a-month charge on electricity bills from this autumn for a decade, for starters. That is how the “regulated asset base” model works. But the mystery – still – is what we’ll pay for Sizewell’s electricity eventually.Here is the government’s less-than-clear claim: the project “could” create savings of £2bn a year versus the alternative of relying on renewable sources, mainly onshore and offshore wind. That is because Sizewell’s higher capital costs are “outweighed by the benefits of reduced network, interconnector and balancing costs”. In other words, nuclear power is easier to connect to the grid and its output is firm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reassuring or enraging, depending on your view of American hegemony, for more than half a century the enormous US embassy, by far the largest in the capital, provided diplomatic, immigration and intelligence services – and an irresistible target for protesters. Its strikingly skeletal grey building on Grosvenor Square, which opened in 1960, became steadily more surrounded by fences, concrete blocks, bollards and other defences: signs of the increasing effort required to maintain the US’s worldwide ascendancy.So it’s strange to visit the square and find that all the defences have gone. You can walk right up to the building, as protesters never managed to in large numbers, on to pavements once menacingly guarded by the embassy’s detachment of US marines, and peer through the rows of windows at an interior eerily transformed.Like the exterior, it has been almost entirely dismantled and then reconstructed over several years, its grey bones warmed and softened with a lavish new colour scheme based on gold. The signal being sent to visitors and passersby is not subtle. The building’s new role is to serve those around whose needs and wishes the centres of London and other prestigious cities are increasingly being reshaped: the 1%.Staying at the Chancery Rosewood, as the former embassy is now known, will cost between £1,520 and £24,102 a night – the latter half the annual median salary in London – when the hotel’s first guests arrive on 1 September. Among other amenities, they will have an “immersive wellness area”, “courtesy Bentley cars” and a “curated art exhibition with art concierge”. The combination of material ostentation, health micromanagement and exclusive cultural opportunities required by the very wealthy these days will be provided by a formerly American hospitality chain, now owned by a conglomerate based in Hong Kong. The building itself is owned by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund. As so often in Britain, the ambition of some non-western countries to reverse their relationship with the old imperial powers is hiding in plain sight.View image in fullscreenThe Chancery Rosewood in Mayfair, London.Photograph: Chris Batson/AlamyEnclaves for ultra-wealthy guests are proliferating across a widening swathe of central London. Some of these hotels, such as Raffles London at the OWO (Old War Office) and the Waldorf Astoria London Admiralty Arch, follow a similar formula to the Chancery. Famous, well-located properties sold off by the state – the Old War Office and Admiralty Arch disposed of during the deep spending cuts by David Cameron’s government – are having their history and faded grandeur commodified into something glitzier.By its final years, parts of the Grosvenor Square embassy were actually quite shabby, with worn carpets and frayed office furniture. Maintaining large government premises in expensive city-centre locations, exposed to protests or potential terrorist attack, can ultimately become unappealing for the state, not least because its revenues are limited by the reluctance of many of the 1% to pay their taxes. So the London boom in luxurious office-to-hotel conversions may have been partly prompted, in an indirect way, by the self-interest of some of those who now stay in them. As so often in the 21st century, the behaviour of the 1% feels impervious to satire or condemnation.Fifty-seven years ago, at the height of protests against the Vietnam war, Grosvenor Square filled with demonstrators, among them the leading activist Tariq Ali. In his memoir of the 1960s, Street Fighting Years, he recalls that he and his more excitable comrades “dreamed” of forcing their way into the building, and “using the embassy telex to cable the US embassy in Saigon and inform them that pro-Vietcong forces had seized the premises in Grosvenor Square”. Only mounted police charges and mass arrests saved the London embassy from invasion.Yet now luxury capitalism has managed to do what protesters could not, and take over the building from the spooks and diplomats. With Donald Trump transparently running the US for the benefit of the rich, it feels fitting that the building has become a place for them, rather than Americans in general. The hotel will be open just in time for his September state visit. Perhaps some of his wealthier supporters will take the opportunity to stay.For any guest who worries about the potential provocation of yet another elite hotel, operating at a traditional protest site, in a country in which most people are struggling with a seemingly endless cost of living crisis, the Chancery does have some discreet security. Cameras cover the hotel’s perimeter, and guards circle the building after dark.Meanwhile a couple of miles to the south, in a new London landscape of residential towers and windswept roads at Nine Elms, the successor to the Grosvenor Square embassy stands in the middle of its own, far more extensive security zone, including a partial moat and a defensive wall disguised as a waterfall. The huge pale cube of the current US embassy dominates its neighbourhood even more than its predecessor did. It’s also much further away from the usual routes of London political marches.Some protesters have already adjusted. Thousands of people supporting Palestine walked to the embassy in February, to show their fury at Trump’s backing for Israel. The symbolic contrast between their defiant flags and flimsy placards and the fortress-like building did not work in the US’s favour. The Grosvenor Square embassy may be gone, but the business of challenging the US goes on.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLondonOpinionHotelsUS foreign policyQatarcommentShareReuse this content"

But the government’s plan for voting reform, which will allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in the next general election, isn’t to Labour’s advantage. Voters of this age are unlikely to favour the incumbent government they have grown up with. Though lowering the voting age was amanifesto promise, real electoral reform was nowhere in the manifesto. Real reform would mean abolishing the broken, discredited, untrusted and unsafe first-past-the-post system.Keir Starmer often promises to put country before party. But as this year’s British Social Attitudes surveyfound, only12% of peopletrust governments to put the country’s interest before their own party’s. Labour can prove them wrong by fixing a fragile democracy in grave danger. It needs moral nerve to admit the system that elected it – allowing Labour to win 64% of seats with just 34% of votes – lacks legitimacy. In the words of theElectoral Reform Society, the 2024 result was “not only the most disproportional election in British electoral history, but one of the most disproportional seen anywhere in the world”.The next election threatens to be far worse, when a vote below 30% could produce an unwanted winner as five or six parties get crushed into a two-party system. Voters know they need a louder voice: for the first time, 60% of them – including 52% of Conservative voters – support the introduction of proportional representation (PR),according to pollinglast month. Electoral reform could be their only salvation.This seismic shift in public attitudes has prompted some surprising shifts. Robert Colvile, head of the Centre for Policy Studies, the thinktank founded by Margaret Thatcher and Keith Joseph,writes in the Sunday Times: “I’ve always hated PR … partly because its strongest supporters tend to be the kind of muesli-eating sandal-wearers who have never had a correct opinion in their lives.” But he adds: “Cracks … have been appearing in my implacable dislike,” before concluding that electoral reform is something “we really need” to do.Meanwhile, on the Conservative Home website, the former MP and Tory grandee Nigel Evans, after years of adamantly opposing reforms to the first-past-the-post system, now warns against “sleepwalking” into “a huge majority for one party but no real mandate”. He is calling for a royal commission to review the British voting system.Nigel Farage may become the outlier. He has always hammered first past the post for killing off new parties – despite winning 14% of votes in last year’s election, Reform UK secured only five MPs. On the morning after the vote,Farage blasted: “Our outdated first-past-the-post electoral system is not fit for purpose and we will campaign with anyone and everyone to change this election system.”But in May’s council elections, Reform’s32% vote sharewas rewarded with41% of the council seats up for grabs. The party also gained control of 10 councils. Now leading in the polls, Farage has spoken of an “inversion point” at which first past the post “becomes your friend”. He reckons Reform may be at that point. Expect him to now go silent on the issue (unless his ratings drop and he clambers back on to the campaign for proportional representation).As for Labour, its 2022 conferencepassed a non-binding motionto introduce PR in its first term. Alan Renwick, a UCL professor and deputy director of the Constitution Unit, warns that it’s virtually unknown anywhere in the world for a governing party to introduce reforms against its own interests. But times have changed: Labour could regain trust with a country-not-party stand to prevent the perverse results it benefited from last time. The risks ahead are unprecedented. The psephologist and former YouGov president Peter Kellner has written in a number of excellent blogs that “the prospect of a democratic disaster is real”. He was no electoral reformer – until now.Changing the voting system to prevent a Farage win could look like dirty politics. But here’s what has changed. Kellner’s historical analysis shows that British elections have always ended up with the government more people chose, even where results appeared contrary. Labour wasn’t loved, but throwing out the Tories was the priority shared among most voters. Should Farage become prime minister,Kellner writes, “for the first time in living memory, the country is likely to have a government that most people really don’t want”.Reformscores firstas the party that voters would never support.Farage is the leader whom most people want the least. Starmer is preferred by 44% of people when set against Farage, with the Reform leader backed by 29%.Yet despite Farage’s unprecedented unpopularity, he could become prime minister with a 29% share of the vote. At this crisis point, it would be an unforgivable dereliction of duty shouldLabourfail to act.A proportional system gives fair seats for fair votes: there’s no need to delve intothe complicated mathematical formula of thede Hondt methodto prove that.Kellner calls for the simplest safeguard against the most unpopular choice winning, thealternative vote, which is not a form of proportional representation but how all parties select leaders and candidates. Instead of marking an “X” next to their preferred candidate, voters rank candidates in order. If none of them top 50%, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are reassigned according to the second preferences expressed on the ballot papers. The process continues until one candidate receives more than 50% of the vote and, as the least hated, is declared the winner. Labour would have won the last election using this voting system, but not with a landslide. Alternative voting can be introduced instantly and doesn’t ask MPs to vote for a system that would put their seats in jeopardy. Politically, it discourages extremism, because every party seeks other parties’ second preferences.Kellner would introduce it now with a referendum only after people had tried it at the next election. Labour has the muscle, but does it dare act? The 2011 referendum on alternative voting was a fiasco, in which Dominic Cummings cut his Brexit teeth with a campaign of breathtaking mendacity. The government would certainly get overwhelming support for a royal commission consulting widely and reporting fast. They must act now,before our broken system causes a democratic calamity.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElectoral reformOpinionFirst past the postProportional representationLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

I’m just a little bit nosy and happen to procrastinate by staring out of the window. Inspiration rarely strikes during these procrastination sessions – but I have absorbed an awful lot of information about my neighbours. “Guess what,” I’ll say to my wife. “I think the flight attendant who always puts his trash out when it’s not trash day broke up with his boyfriend because I haven’t seen him around lately.” My wife, meanwhile, never has any idea what I’m talking about and usually tells me to mind my own business.I’m starting to think she has a point. In fact, we should all work a little harder at minding our own business. Because I’m not the only nosy parker out there, am I? Judging by the global obsession with theColdplaycouple, we’re all far too invested in other people’s lives.If you have no idea what on earth that last sentence was about, congratulations. But I’ll just go ahead and destroy your blissful ignorance by explaining that, last week, a couple reacted in a very guilty manner after they got caught on the kiss cam at a Coldplay concert. Singer Chris Martin made a quip about them having an affair and, after footage of the event went viral, internet sleuths quickly discovered that they were colleagues at an AI company called Astronomer. The star-crossed lovers were the (now former) CEO and the head of HR. The story has made worldwide news and been re-enacted atvarious sports games.No one should go to a concert where there are more than 50,000 people, each with a recording device in hand, expecting privacy. But the way this story has developed is a jarring reminder of the reach of the surveillance state and the internet’s insatiable appetite for public shaming. Not only were the pair’s identities discovered immediately; people identified the CEO’s spouse and bombarded her Facebook page with cruel comments. Meanwhile, rumours swirled that a woman sitting next to the Coldplay couple was another employee who was helping to cover up the supposed affair. Astronomer put out a statement denying this, but that poor woman probably also got flooded with unsolicited messages. (Social media smearing an innocent person is hardly new, of course. Several blameless people were wrongly accused of being Boston marathonbombing suspectsin 2013.)While lives were upended in an instant during that Coldplay concert, at least one person seems to see a silver lining. “The events of the past few days have received a level of media attention that few companies – let alone startups in our small corner of the data and AI world – ever encounter,” Pete DeJoy, Astronomer’s interim CEO,wrote in a LinkedIn poston Monday. “While I would never have wished for it to happen like this, Astronomer is now a household name.” Congrats, I guess?Gracie Springer, the fan who filmed the viral moment, is not a household name yet, but plenty of “experts” are giving her advice on how to become one.The Mailquoted a number of social media strategists salivating over ways Springer might parlay her 15 minutes into money and fame, perhaps becoming the nextHawk Tuahgirl. “Grace’s video may not have earned her money, but it’s earned her a name,” one expert opined. “The question now is how she monetises that visibility.” As the old saying goes, one person’s personal tragedy is another person’s monetisable content opportunity.I suppose that, in a roundabout way, many of us consented to this. We clicked “accept” on90,000-wordprivacy agreements that we didn’t read, signing away all our data in exchange for convenience and dopamine hits. We handed over our personal information to Mark Zuckerberg, a man who called his users “dumb fucks” for trusting him. We carry tracking devices in our pockets and watch “smart” TVs thatwatch us right back. We sold our privacy cheaply, creating surveillance billionaires in the process.And those billionaires, of course, guard their own privacy fiercely. Zuckerberg, for example, is spending an estimated $300m on a secretive apocalypse bunker in Hawaii. The workersreportedlyhave to sign non-disclosure agreements, so few people know exactly what is going on, other than the fact Zuck keeps building more mysterious buildings with blast-resistant doors. In a recent piece analysing the compound, a Wired reporter snapped a photo of a guard’s shack and was immediately reprimanded. “Don’t do that,” the guard said. “They don’t like that. They’re very private.” It seems privacy isn’t totally dead – it’s just very expensive.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsColdplayOpinionMark ZuckerbergArtificial intelligence (AI)SurveillancePrivacyPrivacy & the mediaSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

There are many bleaker, deadlier things happening daily in this country, and the field of late-night comedy has been dying slowly for years, but the cancellation of The Late Show, three days after Colbert called out its parent company for settling a lawsuit with Donald Trump, felt especially and pointedly depressing – more a sign of cultural powerlessness and corporate fecklessness in the face of a bully president than the inevitable result of long-shifting tastes.The end of Stephen Colbert’s Late Show is a concerning nail in the coffin for comedy | Jesse HassengerRead moreReporting in the days since the announcement have lent some credence to CBS’s claim that this was “purely a financial decision”. Though The Late Show has led the field of late-night comedy in ratings for years, it only averages about 2.47 million viewers a night. Its ad revenue plummeted after the pandemic; Puck’s Matthew Bellonireportedthat the show loses $40m for CBS every year. Of the network late-night shows – NBC’s Late Night With Seth Meyers, The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon, and ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live! – Colbert’s Late Show has the smallest footprint on social media, where Fallon’s celebrity gags still reign supreme. The format of late-night television – a host delivering a topical monologue, house band, celebrity guest interviews – is a living relic of a different time, when a youth-skewing audience would reliably pop on linear television at 11.30pm. The field has been contracting for years, with programs hosted by Samantha Bee, James Corden and Taylor Tomlinson ending without replacement. Ad revenue for the genre as a whole is down 50% from just seven years ago, in the middle of Trump 1.0. It’s long been assumed that the hosts currently in these once-coveted chairs would be the last, their programs expiring when they decided to step down.What’s shocking is that Colbert, who was reportedly set to renegotiate his one-year contract at the end of this season, was not given that time, which just so happens tocoincide with a critical windowfor theintended mergerof CBS parent company Paramount with Skydance Media. Three days before the announcement, Colbert called Paramount’s settlement with Trump a “big fat bribe” to incentivize the administration’s approval of this $8bn deal managed by two billionaire families.Regardless of Colbert’s contract timing, it seems the cancellation of The Late Showisa financial decision, just not in the way CBS is framing it. It’s not about the $40m The Late Show is losing per year – a lot of money, to be sure, though a drop in the bucket for the major players here – but the $8bn on the line with this merger. There were presumably other options; Late Night With Seth Meyers dispensed of its house band and musical acts last year to save money. With new billionaire ownership, there could be some business maneuvering, should independent political comedy be a priority. Colbert’s Late Show, a leading critic of Donald Trump on network television, is clearly not; the show may have been a money loser, but in this context, it’s a convenient sacrifice.And though it’s easy to roll one’s eyes at late-night television – I often do – it’s an especially disappointing one, both in the culture at large and in the dwindling 11.35pm time slot. For years, I havearguedthat the late-night shows have long outstripped their original function as comedy programs. They are satirical, occasionally relevant, sometimes profane, but hardly ever funny, in the traditional sense of making you laugh. Often, they resort to so-called “clapter” – laughter as a polite applause, jokes for agreement rather than laughter – in adeadening anti-Trump feedback loop. With the exception of The Daily Show, a cable program founded for the purpose of political satire, the shows basically serve two functions in the internet era: 1 Generate viral celebrity content as they promote another project, and 2 Comment freely on the news, unbound from the strictures of decorum, tone and supposed “objectivity” that hamstrings so much journalism in the US.How should late-night comedy handle a third Trump candidacy?Read moreThe latter was, I’d argue, the most important contribution of late-night television in the Trump era, when the president and his minions exceeded parody, and Colbert was the best at it. Nimble, erudite, self-deprecating but exceptionally well-read, Colbert transformed from extremely successful Fox News satirist to the reverend father of late-night TV: principled, authoritative but hardly ever self-righteous, deeply faithful to the American project, steadfastly believing in the decency of others. (Colbert is a practicing Catholic and die-hard Lord of the Rings fan, facts that sometimes snuck into his monologues.) At times, such old-school values felt insufficient for the moment; the format of late-night comedy as a whole has proven futile, even pathetic, in the face of Donald Trump’s brand of shamelessness, the Maga movement’s ability to turn everything into a joke. But these hosts, and the Daily Show-trained Colbert especially, did something that the rest of news media or the sprawling celebrity and comedian podcast network could not: call bullshit on the administration with the imprimatur of a major television network, and say exactly what they were feeling.That ability proved useful to me, as a viewer, at times when it seemed standard media was incapable of articulating what was happening. During the pandemic, or the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, or on January 6, or when Trump was re-elected, or when Republicans mocked Californians during the devastating LA wildfires earlier this year, late-night television had the freedom to express outrage, and Colbert in particular to express moral injury. The jokes were almost never surprising; they weren’t really even jokes. But it still felt soothing to see someone say them, with corporate backing, at an institution that still carried enough name recognition to, well, merit a “late-night roundup”.Colbert, ultimately, will be fine. He is a skilled comedian whose talents weren’t always well-tapped by the strict format of late-night comedy. Perhaps he will join the legion of comedians with podcasts, speaking directly to fans; perhaps he will release a special. But his absence from late-night televisionspells doomfor the rest of the format, and more importantly for freedom of speech on the big networks. Late-night comedy has been fighting a losing battle for a long time, and The Late Show was never going to out-influence the rising tide of rightwing media, the manosphere or any number of independent shows in a fracturing media landscape. But the fact that he could try, from one of the more famed perches in television, still meant something.Explore more on these topicsStephen ColbertOpinionTrump administrationParamount PicturesUS televisionTV comedyComedyTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

Every time I’m there, my sister asks me to water the garden, and I never do. Then she says: “Please, just do the window boxes, otherwise the plants will die,” and I still don’t. “I may come and take the potted plants away, or you could take some, if you want to kill them in your own house?”, she says, and still I ignore her, because I don’t know anything about gardening. So it follows that, being my sibling, she doesn’t either. No amount of evidence to the contrary – her own, frankly magnificent garden – can convince me otherwise.This is a two-way street. She is a fashion designer and exquisite draughtsperson – which I, also, after many decades, have yet to wrap my head around – but she can’t drive, and if ever she is a passenger when I’m driving, she is on red alert, pointing out things – mainly other cars, pedestrians, trees – as if, without her intervention, I would plough straight into them. Our brother is a skilled decorator and, when he uses words such as “primer” and “dust sheet”, I can’t help looking at him as if a cat is talking. He is a photographer by profession, and, even if we point the same phone at the same object, he creates images that are unfathomably deeper and more pleasing than mine. I look on this not so much as a knowledge base he has that I don’t, and more like an act of hocus-pocus. My other brother is a maths teacher, my other sister is a physicist, and I cannot describe how fanciful I find it that they may really be doing these jobs. Obviously, I have to pretend to believe it. I don’t even know whether you get wired in childhood to think all knowledge is equally distributed because otherwise it isn’t fair, or that every fine difference in skillset is just a question of whoever is younger catching up. But no amount of adulthood can overturn it.Anyway, I couldn’t help but notice that, after it rained, the garden looked amazing. It’s possible my sister is right on this one thing.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSiblingsOpinionFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Finding them, in a sector where employees have historically been grossly underpaid and undervalued, will be one of the challenges of the next decade.Against that disconcerting backdrop,curtailingthe practice of hiring care workers from overseas would seem to be – to put it mildly – counterintuitive policymaking. But that is what the government has chosen to do, despite opposition from both Care England and Unison, the biggest union representing health and care workers. On Tuesday, as part of Labour’s broader drive to significantly reduce legal migration, the special visa route that allowed international staff to ease a dire recruitment crisis was closed down. Care workers already here on a sponsorship visa will have to stay for 10 years rather than five to win indefinite leave to remain.Justifying the decision, Labour has pointed to evidence ofabuseof the visa system by unscrupulous employers. Egregious exploitation of vulnerable workers has undoubtedly taken place, and needs to be fully stamped out. But that could be achieved through better regulation, rather than what amounts to a ban on future hiring from abroad. In truth, the government’s motives have more to do with the wider political goal of spiking Reform UK’s guns onimmigration.The upshot for the social care sector is that institutions already on the edge, as a result of rising costs and understaffing, have lost a potential future lifeline. The number of care workers recruited from overseas had, in any case, already fallen steeply last year after visas for dependants were curtailed. But in a notoriously dysfunctional system, their presence has continued to be indispensable.The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, hasrespondedto concerns by arguing that providers will in future have to make a greater effort to attract domestic applicants. In the brave new world envisaged by Ms Cooper, that should lead to a much-needed improvement in pay and working conditions as employers seek to incentivise new recruits. To hasten this process, Labour hasproposedmeasures designed to pave the way for a “fair pay agreement” in the sector.Such initiatives are long overdue in a historically underunionised environment. But truly transformative change will only come about through the type of central funding settlement that successive governments havepromisedand then failed to deliver. It is a national disgrace thatone in fiveresidential care workers live in poverty, despite performing a vital, often stressful role that requires complex skills. But cash-strapped councils already overwhelmed by the cost of commissioning social care are not in a position to help right that wrong.Labour has charged Dame Louise Casey with coming up with a comprehensive financial solution. But herindependent commission into adult social carewill not make its final report until 2028, by which time parliament’s focus will be entirely on the next election. For the foreseeable future, those requiring the services of Britain’s chronically neglected adult social care sector will thus be obliged to take their chances. That makes this week’s decision to reject future assistance from overseas look shortsighted at best, and politically cynical at worst.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That “there were no deaths” was one of the justifications given by Theresa May’s government for thedecision not to order an inquiryin 2016. But the brutal treatment of miners picketing the South Yorkshire coking plant and the criminal case brought against them a year later for rioting have cast deep shadows. The inquiry, chaired by Pete Wilcox, the bishop of Sheffield, will aim to bring long-hidden truths about the policing of the strike into the light.Placingthese factsin the public domain matters to those affected, some of whom faced the prospect of lengthy prison sentences until police statements and evidence in court were discredited, with paragraphs shown to have been dictated by detectives. But the inquiry has wider significance. Policing by consent, by definition, rests on trust, not brute force. To be worthy of public confidence, forces must be willing to learn, and be held accountable for wrongdoing. The fact that the same police force, South Yorkshire, bore responsibility for the disastrous loss of life at Hillsborough stadium, five years after Orgreave, underscores that need. If the force and its chief constable, Peter Wright, had been properly challenged after the miners’ trial collapsed, might the catastrophe in Sheffield, or at least the alleged cover-up afterwards, have been avoided?In aGuardian article in 2012, David Conn highlighted striking similarities between the two episodes, and linked the victim-blaming that followed the Hillsborough disaster with the portrayal of striking miners as a vicious “enemy within”. This inquiry is a victory for journalists andfilm-makersas well the campaign itself.The inquiry’s format, modelled on the Hillsborough Independent Panel, marks a bold break with the most familiar one for government-ordered inquiries – which are usually headed by a judge. The Orgreave panel will have the power to summon witnesses. But it may opt to focus mainly on documentary evidence, mostly records held by police forces, rather than conducting lengthy oral sessions. Given how much time has already passed – the 40th anniversary of the collapsed trial is this month – the hope must be that work proceeds swiftly once the panel’s membership is agreed.Inquiries are not perfect. They cantake too longand cost participants a colossal effort. While they make recommendations, it is politicians who decide whether or not to take these up, and police and prosecutors who determine whether criminal charges follow. But when whole institutions are recognised to have gravely, systematically failed people – as happens tragically often – an inquiry provides a vital public forum for the first stage of redress: digging out the truth.The miners of Orgreave have waited too long for this moment. It should not have taken decades for a home secretary to agree to a formal process, particularly given all that isknown about Hillsborough, and given that the force settled a civil claim bypaying 39 miners £425,000in 1991. But belated scrutiny of the actions, culture and leadership of South Yorkshire police in the relevant period is infinitely preferable to none at all. The announcement is a win for all of civil society, as well as a determined group of campaigners.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s the fourth minute of injury time in the Euro 2025 semi-final. Every England player bar Chloe Kelly is within 20 yards of Italy’s goal. And as blisteringly underwhelming as England have been all night, this is still a team with an unerring sense of their own narrative, a belief in themselves, a taste for the dramatic climax.The noise builds to a roar. The roar builds to a scream. Kelly puts her corner straight into the side netting. Hampton hangs her head and gallops back into more familiar territory. End of the road. England are done.Kelly and Agyemang fire England into Euro 2025 final after comeback against ItalyRead moreOf course there had been the usual gripes about Italian gamesmanship, the eternity Laura Giuliani was taking over goal kicks, the constant injury breaks, the sudden random attacks of cramp.The real timewasters here, though, were not Italy but England, who on a shapeless and lawless night in Geneva conspired to waste a nation’s entire evening, before finally doing the thing they were paid to do.Sarina Wiegman had wasted 76 minutes of this game tinkering around the edges of an approach that was patently not working. Once again she had treated her substitutions as if she were paying for them out of her own pocket. Kelly, one of England’s brightest players of the tournament, had spent the night doing sprints up the touchline in a bib. Michelle Agyemang was once a Wembley ball girl, and here she was again: marooned on the sidelines, a peripheral figure, waiting to be called briefly into action.At the start of the second half England’s players had gathered in a huddle, presumably in order to learn each other’s names and positions. Hi, I’m Alex, left-back. Hi, I’m Ella, attacking midfield. Lauren, left wing, how you doing? And if the heist against Sweden had a kind of stirring Blitz spirit to it, tones and shades, a clear sense of purpose, here England were simply pointless, one-dimensional, lacking in craft or identity or even the most basic idea of how they wanted to play.View image in fullscreenEngland enjoyed plenty of fortune as they edged through to the final at Italy’s expense.Photograph: Sébastien Bozon/AFP/Getty ImagesAt which point, you might point out – not unreasonably – that England won. And fair enough. Agyemang at the death, Kelly’s penalty rebound, the surge of endorphins, the fans in the stands reeling to Sweet Caroline: great moments, brilliant memories. Proof of the spirit and guts and resilience, and all that. And rinse, and repeat. The final on Sunday against Germany or Spain will be another occasion of national significance, another milestone for the growing women’s game.And so you might say the end justified the means, if in fact it were possible to identify any means. Against a team far inferior to Sweden, flagging and flailing, deprived of their best player through injury and offering pretty much nothing between the 35th and the 85th minutes, England had nothing to offer but slow-cooked panic. It was a vindication of nothing, an indication of nothing but the ability of a deeper, more talented squad to bungle a result through blind luck.Michelle AgyemangNone of this felt like the result of a calculated masterplan, or even a stronger mentality. Italy defended magnificently all game and but for a fumble by Giuliani and a slightly naive challenge by Emma Severini would have enjoyed the greatest night in their history. Even the winning goal owed itself to dumb fortune: Kelly’s penalty was so straight that there was barely any angle for Giuliani to push it to the side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For a nation as integral to the game’s development and history as England, that loves this sport as much as England, this side’s inability to express itself through its football is going to be the sort of thing that holds future teams back. How should England look and feel? What are its basic principles of play? How should we as a public identify with them, beyond a shirt and an empty nationalism and some vaguely lifestyle-themed content?Win or lose on Sunday, this generation of great England footballers has had its time. The future is Agyemang and Aggie Beever-Jones, Grace Clinton and Maya Le Tissier, and arguably the present should be too. Perhaps we are discovering the limits of Wiegman’s staunch loyalty to her class of 2022, her stubborn persistence with players and patterns that have long since been decrypted by the rest of Europe.The final whistle blows and after the celebrations subside, England’s players decide to link hands and run towards their supporters. Even here there is a kind of incoherence to them, everyone running at different speeds, everyone seeing the move at different times.And of course there is still one game to go. One more chance to make an impression. One more chance to produce a level of football we have not seen from England yet at this tournament, arguably not really seen from this side for a couple of years. England have cheated death twice. They will not be allowed to do so again.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamItaly women's football teamWomen's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

Paret-Peintre’s impressive victory came at the expense of the indefatigable Ben Healy, who was within a hair’s breadth of taking his second stage win of the Tour.Tour de France 2025: Valentin Paret-Peintre conquers Mont Ventoux to win stage 16 – as it happenedRead moreIt was Paret-Peintre’s second Grand Tour win, after his stage victory in the 2024 Giro. “This morning I didn’t think this was possible, because I expected [Tadej] Pogacar to want to win,” he said.Yet the absence of his Soudal Quick-Step team leader, Remco Evenepoel, who abandoned the Tour in the Pyrenees, opened a door of opportunity for the climber from the Haute-Savoie. “I could see that I wasn’t strong enough to drop Healy in the finale,” he said, of his team’s fourth stage win in this year’s race, “so I focused on trying to beat him in the sprint.”But while Healy and Paret-Peintre were playing out the final moments of a sparring match that had started much further down the mountain,Jonas Vingegaardwas keeping his promise to attack the race leader Pogacar.Just 48 hours after Vingegaard’s Visma-Lease a Bike team had been lambasted for their lack of cohesion andaccused of disloyaltytowards the two-time champion by some critics, they were transformed into a cohesive well-drilled unit, working hard to support his efforts to dislodge Pogacar.View image in fullscreenValentin Paret-Peintre crosses the finish line ahead of Ben Healy on top of Mont Ventoux to win stage 16 of the Tour de France.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/APSepp Kuss, Wout van Aert and Tiesj Benoot put in lengthy turns pacemaking their leader on the never-ending climb, in the hope of finally cracking Pogacar. “The team did really amazing today,” Vingegaard said. “Everybody worked, there was real commitment from everyone.”But the Dane’s best efforts, which saw him make several attacks on his rival, came to nothing. On the Ventoux’s cruel final bend, perhaps the worst on the climb, the Slovenian again opened up a gap, sneaking clear to increase his overall lead by another couple of seconds.“He followed me every time he attacked and I followed him,” Vingegaard said after the stage. “I don’t know if I could see any weaknesses today but at least, how good I felt gives me motivation. I will keep trying.“I was feeling very good, so I’m happy. I didn’t get any time, but I take a lot of motivation from it.”Yet insult was added to injury when Vingegaard collided with a photographer on the Ventoux summit’s cramped finish line. “A photographer stepped right in front of me,” he said. “I don’t know what he was doing. I went down. People who are working on the finish line need to be more careful.”However hard he tries, he cannot find any weaknesses in Pogacar’s armour. Vingegaard’s first attacks, in the forested section of the climb, splintered the main peloton and took him across to his teammate Benoot.For a fleeting moment and for perhaps the first time in this Tour, Pogacar initially showed signs of stress. At Chalet Reynard however, 6km from the top, the pair were still inseparable, although Vingegaard had one more card to play.View image in fullscreenTadej Pogacar follows Jonas Vingegaard up Ventoux before going clear in the final metres.Photograph: Papon Bernard/ReutersAs they bridged up to another of his teammates, Victor Campenaerts, he had another ally to pace him into the decisive kilometres. But the Dane’s next move, with 4km to race, once more failed to dislodge the race leader.The pair’s blistering times on Ventoux shattered all precedents. The past record, set by Spain’s Iban Mayo in a 2004 time trial, was 55 minutes and 51 seconds. Pogacar beat that mark by a minute and 20 seconds, with Vingegaard just two seconds slower.Afterwards Pogacar, asked what his limits were, appeared offended by the question. “I don’t think we could ride much faster,” he said. “Jonas and his team did very good pacing. On our aero bikes we go pretty fast, maybe we pick up a couple of seconds. I don’t know. What do you want?”He maintained too that, despite appearances, he was no Superman. “I’m definitely not Superman. I was born in Ljubljana. Today was an epic climb to do and we brought down the gap quite fast. We saw the winners in the last 800 metres, but even for Superman I don’t think it would have been possible to catch them.”There were some other shifts in the overall standings, although Kelso’s Oscar Onley clung on and remains stubbornly in fourth place overall, after finishing 14th on the stage. But Primoz Roglic, ninth on the Ventoux, is moving up the standings and has now climbed into the top five, while the unflagging Healy remains in the Tour’s top 10, in ninth place overall.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarJonas VingegaardTour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

An outbreak of Covid‑19 among their backroom staff led to the series finale beingcalled off just 90 minutes before the toss, even if many suspected the proximity of the rescheduled Indian Premier League also had a role to play.“I saw Lanky the Giraffe walking into the ground with his head slumped,” said Tom Harrison, at the time chief executive of the England and WalesCricketBoard, after crossing paths with Lancashire’s club mascot that morning. “It summed up my feelings, too.”Shubman Gill believes England breached ‘spirit of the game’ during third TestRead moreOther than the usual concerns about weather in these parts – and the forecast looks better than what was a soggy last day of training – Lanky has reason to be a bit more chipper this time around. Afterthat niggly classic at Lord’s, send-offs, sledging et al, England sit 2-1 up with two to play, making this Test one of two chances to claim what would be a first series victory against India in seven years.Results under Ben Stokes have been strong overall, with his win rate of 61.11% second only to WG Grace (61.53) among England captains in double figures. But going by the short-term addition to the staff of Gilbert Enoka – the former All Blacks coach has been hired to work on “culture, training and mindset” this summer – he andBrendon McCullumare keen to take the project to the next level.This ultimately means winning Test series against the other members of the so-called Big Three, something which is yet to occur under the pair. Wrapping things up early against India could even assist the planning for Australia this winter by allowing for experimentation at the Oval – not that anyone is thinking that far ahead.Quick GuideFourth Test teamsShowEmirates Old Trafford, Wednesday 23 July to Sunday 27 July11am BST startsEngland (confirmed): Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (wk), Liam Dawson, Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Jofra ArcherIndia (possible):Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (c), Rishabh Pant (wk), Karun Nair, Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Anshul Kamboj, Mohammed SirajWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Indeed, as Manchester comes down from the recent Oasis reunion gigs in Heaton Park, England are trying to be here now.They haveparachuted the 35‑year‑old spinner Liam Dawsoninto the XI for the injured Shoaib Bashir and a first cap since 2017, and kept faith with 36-year-old seamer Chris Woakes. The latter comes in spite of seven wickets at 56 in this series and the greater flexibility that Dawson’s return at No 8 clearly allowed.“Woaksey has a very good record here,” Stokes said, when asked about this. “Outside of the rewards that he hasn’t had with the ball, he is a very important player for us. He adds control with the ball, it is handy having him down the order, and we won last week, so we didn’t see there was a necessary change to make.”That record is pretty stellar, it should be said, Woakes having taken 35 wickets at 17 at Old Trafford. But had Gus Atkinson been up to speed – England’s concerns are clearly shared by Surrey, given they opted against using him this week – a second change may well have occurred. Josh Tongue was the other seamer but, with Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse in situ, triple pace was not a blend England fancied.Though not by design, Stokes stressed, it also means England now have a notably deep batting lineup, with Carse, a player who boasts two first-class centuries and made what proved a critical 56 at Lord’s last week, carded at No 10. But then how much this lower‑order insurance will be needed is something of an unknown.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The hope is that the end of the heatwave and the recent rain will bring a touch more zip. Certainly Stokes, who expressed his disappointment at the surfaces so far this series, would love the bounce once associated with the ground to return.View image in fullscreenChris Woakes has an impressive record at Old Trafford where he has taken 35 wickets.Photograph: Chris Foxwell/ProSports/ShutterstockGautam Gambhir, India’s head coach, had a long look at the pitch 24 hours out from the toss and what he saw was a touch more grass than at Lord’s. Having lost Akash Deep to a groin injury, Gambhir has asked Jasprit Bumrah to go again. Although even with the world’s No 1 bowler supposedly limited to three outings on this tour, it would have been strange to leave him out given the current scoreline.Otherwise, and in contrast to England, India will keep everyone guessing as to their final XI with the captain, Shubman Gill, joking that it is nice to “keep some mystery”. The talk is that Sai Sudharsan could return at No 3, having been dropped after the defeat in Leeds, with Karun Nair sliding back down to No 6. There may also be a debut for the seamer Anshul Kamboj and a possible comeback for the all‑rounder Shardul Thakur.Injuries to Deep and Nitish Kumar Reddy notwithstanding, this potential rejig gives the impression of India being slightly confused. Although the same was said before their first Test win at Edgbaston. And if the tourists can similarly break their duck at Old Trafford, a finale worthy of a hard-fought series will come to pass this time.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025Brendon McCullumBen StokesEngland cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some nifty boundary-striking in the gaps from Sophia Dunkley, Charlie Dean and Alice Davidson-Richards kept them in touch. But with England needing 55 from the last five overs, Jemimah Rodrigues held on to two excellent catches at long-on and the seamer Kranti Goud finished with six for 52, as England were ultimately unable to quite match the late-innings acceleration of their opponents.With the World Cup now 10 weeks away, England will take renewed confidence from the efforts of a middle order which looks at last to have absorbed some of the coach Charlotte Edwards’s lessons about prioritising intelligent cricket above showboating.“We’ve been so composed and smart – the way we navigated that run chase today from 20 for two was outstanding,” Edwards said. “Nat played a big part in that, but it was lovely to see other players contributing and we so nearly chased that down.”England could have sent Harmanpreet Kaur packing for 22, had they referred an lbw call in the 28th over to the third umpire. It was one of two non-referrals which would have led to an Indian batter being dismissed – the other was against Harleen Deol – and exposed some uncertainty about England’s DRS chain-of-command. Traditionally, it is the captain who makes the final call, but both times here Sciver-Brunt appeared to rely purely on Amy Jones’s judgment.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Nat Sciver-Brunt is caught out by Richa Ghosh, bringing to an end her innings of 98.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images/ReutersSciver-Brunt eventually held on to a diving catch at extra cover to dismiss Kaur, but with just eight balls left of the innings it was too late to atone. India’s captain, who had failed to score above 26 in six previous innings on this tour, specialises in scoring runs when her back is against the wall and on Tuesday – after finally winning a toss at the eighth time of asking – her seventh ODI hundred was the mainstay of India’s match-winning total.Earlier, Sophie Ecclestone had conceded just 28 runs in her 10 overs, sending down a remarkable opening spell of 7-2-14-1, including a wicket maiden in which a frustrated Smriti Mandhana pulled straight to Dunkley at short midwicket. But she was bowled out by the 34th over, leaving India to go big at the back end, hammering 120 from the final 10 overs.In an interview broadcast by Sky before the match, Ecclestone revealed that she had come close to retiring earlier in the summer because of the ongoing fallout from the Women’s Ashes, during which she came under fire after refusing an interview with the BBC’s Alex Hartley.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In better news, Marcus Smith passed a head injury assessment ensuring he was not automatically ruled out of the second Test.Lions edge historic First Nations clash with help of Jamie Osborne triesRead moreOn Tuesday the Lions – led by captain for the night Owen Farrell – defeatedthe First Nations & Pasifika XV 24-19, having been level at 14-14 at half-time. Blair Kinghorn played all 80 minutes on his return from injury but endured a mixed bag of a game, while Garry Ringrose came on inside in the opening 20 minutes after an injury to Darcy Graham. Owen Farrell, meanwhile, showed some impressive glimpses and staked a claim for a place on the bench on Saturday.By and large Andy Farrell is expected to stick by the majority of his starters from thefirst Test win in Brisbanelast weekend, with Ollie Chessum ready to deputise for McCarthy. The Lions led by 19 points at one stage in Brisbane but allowed the Wallabies to claw back to within eight at the final whistle.Asked if there was room for improvement, Farrell said: “Plenty, yes. There will have to be plenty to get to the point where a win’s on the cards because we know that Australia are going to be … can you put a percentage on it, it’s going to be a lot. If you can’t get up for what’s coming, we’re all in the wrong place. To me, this is the biggest game of our lives, every one of us that’s part of our squad, so we’ll make sure that we address the week like that.”Smith was withdrawn late on against the First Nations & Pasifika XV, raising fears that he may have to drop out of the Test squad and further open the door forOwen Farrellto feature.Andy Farrell confirmed that Smith was fine and offered an honest appraisal of Owen’s performance, highlighting his left-footed chip to set up Jamie Osborne’s opening try. “Some good things obviously, a nice little chip off the left peg. Some nice touches on the ball as well but always work‑ons, there are always work‑ons.”Farrell Jr completed all 80 minutes – all too often a rarity in an injury‑plagued season – and relished the challenge against a fired up First Nations & Pasifika XV for whom Charlie Gamble, Taniela Tupou and Lukhan Salakaia-Loto all shone. “I enjoyed it,” the former England captain said. “There’s always things you can do better and we’ll have a look back at the game and see what they were. But I loved being out there.“I loved that it was difficult, that it was hard tonight. We got some joy early on but it was a tough match. I feel like I’ve been in a tough match now sat here. So I’m grateful for that.“For the rest of it, we’ll see. We’ve got a job to do regardless for the rest of this tour – whether you’re lucky enough to be involved or preparing the team for what is a massive occasion on Saturday and next week – so it’ll be great whatever it is.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mack Hansen, who missed the first Test with a foot injury, is in a similar position, with the Lions head coach saying: “Mack’s progressing. Whether he’s progressing quick enough we’ll see towards the end of the week.“There’s all sorts that goes into it, some performances [from tonight], there’s no doubt about that. But there’s also what’s right for this second [Test] and what that presents and the makeup of the squad and how it feels. Are a few changes going to freshen it up, or do we go with the same guys?“All that comes into the pot and it’s whatever’s best for the team that we think that we need on a game like that at the MCG with over 90,000 people.

We also have to wait for the right moments [to go forward] but these moments will come.“We have to show our strengths in attack, which we couldn’t really do against France, when we have the ball. We have our philosophy and our principles and how we want to play as a German team and they haven’t changed. We want to go into the duels and actively win the ball.”Spain have had one more day’s rest, having beaten Switzerland 2-0 on Friday, before Germany’s energy‑sapping win against France. Germany produced a heroic display after Hendrich’s sending-off for pulling Griedge Mbock’s hair in her own penalty area. They went 1-0 down from the resulting penalty but Sjoeke Nüsken equalised in the first half before a rearguard action enabled Germany to take the game to penalties.Rebecca Knaak, one of the defenders who had to deal with sustained France pressure, said the performance had set the benchmark for the players’ work rate: “The game against France showed what is needed in terms of fighting spirit, passion, desire and unity. Those are the values that we have to embody and they will be important against Spain, too.”Germany won eight out of nine European championships between 1989 and 2013 (the first secured by West Germany) but countries such as Spain – and England – have moved ahead of them. They did reach the Euro 2022 final, losing against the Lionesses, but the following year’s World Cup was another step back, the team going out at the group stage.Germany’s Jule BrandWück – whose appointment was announced in March 2024, with his first game against England in October – has introduced a more attacking style with the wingers Jule Brand and Klara Bühl crucial to his tactics. Both players have been in fine form in Switzerland, with Wück picking out the former for particular praise on Tuesday. “Jule’s performances from the first game against Poland through to the quarter-final against France speak for themselves. She has taken the next step up and proved that she is continuing to develop. I am very pleased with her.”Spain have their own array of attacking players with Esther González (four goals) and Alèxia Putellas (three) among the tournament’s four top scorers, and Clàudia Pina and Athenea del Castillo one behind. Putellas said on Tuesday that they had to keep their focus to reach the final.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will be a tough match, like any semi-final, but we have the utmost excitement and confidence to keep moving forward and make history once again.”View image in fullscreenAlèxia Putellas (right) helps Clàudia Pina celebrate the goal that put Spain 2-0 up against Switzerland.Photograph: Anthony Anex/EPAGermany will be without the suspended Hendrich and Carlotta Wamser as well as the injured Giulia Gwinn and Sarai Linder but Tomé, the Spain coach, said she expected a difficult game. “[The missing players] is not something we’re thinking about,” she said. “We know Germany are always strong; physically they’re very good, as we saw in the match against France. Tomorrow they will field their best team to play against us, just as we will.“Excitement is the main driving force of this team. This is the tournament where we’re feeling most comfortable.

Whatever they’re smoking in Boston is having an unusual effect on a global fanbase.Big-spending Liverpool, blowing competitors from Bayern Munich to Newcastle out of the water with their pulling and spending power, may be a strange reality for supporters who not so long ago sang: “The Reds have got no money, but we’ll still win the league.” The chant can be retired now that the first part is demonstrably untrue. It always was.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreWhenHugo Ekitiké completes his move from Eintracht Frankfurt, for a deal that Liverpool would be delighted to reach £79m because it would represent further success at club and individual level, the champions will have made two of the three biggest signings in their history in the space of five weeks. Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s Boston-based owner, would have been prepared to break the club’s transfer record twice in that timeframe but for Newcastle’s insistence that Alexander Isak is not for sale.It appears a radical departure by FSG to build so ambitiously from a position of strength, while sending an ominous warning to Premier League rivals with designs on closing the gap. But Liverpool maintain there has been no change in strategy and that the club continue to be run along self-sustaining lines. The approach that enabled them to transform Jürgen Klopp’s team in 2018 by buying Alisson and Virgil van Dijk with the proceeds of Philippe Coutinho’s £142m sale to Barcelona has also shaped plans for sustained success under Arne Slot. The benefits of thinking long term have paid off. No profitability and sustainability issues here.The answer to how Liverpool have been able to spend heavily this summer is dull, out of step with many clubs throughout the English football pyramid and anathema to those besotted with winning the transfer window over genuine prizes: financial discipline.Liverpool last spent big in the summer of 2023 when rebuilding Klopp’s midfield to the tune of £145m while recouping £52m from the sales of Fabinho and Jordan Henderson to the Saudi Pro League. Not a penny was spent in the January transfer windows of 2024 and 2025, and last summer, Slot’s first in charge, brought an outlay of only £10m for Federico Chiesa, the amount received from Salzburg for Bobby Clark. Liverpool made a profit of £42.5m last summer with the sales of Fábio Carvalho and Sepp van den Berg to Brentford (if taking the initial £25m for Valencia’s goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili – agreed 12 months ago – into this year’s expenditure). The club’s faith in the rebuilding work of 2023 explained their reticence to re-enter the market in three successive windows, and was vindicated withtitle No 20 in April.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s spending this summer may not have finished as they remain keen on Crystal Palace central defender Marc Guéhi.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAThe importance of Champions League qualification to Liverpool’s financial health was evident in their last set of published accounts, for the year to 31 May 2024, which showed a £57m loss mainly as a consequence of missing out that year and competing in the Europa League. Revenue for this year is projected to pass £700m for the first time with the club making more than £80m from the return to the Champions League and about £180m from the triumphant Premier League campaign. Matchday and commercial revenue will have increased as Liverpool continue to benefit from the redevelopments of the Main Stand and Anfield Road Stand.This summer’s transfer business – with Ekitiké soon to join the record signing Florian Wirtz, Mamardashvili, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez, the young Hungarian goalkeeping prospect Armin Pecsi and goalkeeping cover Freddie Woodman – leaves the champions looking stronger on paper before their title defence. Any predictions for Liverpool this season, of course, must be tempered by the unknown and unimaginable factor of a team dealing with the tragic death of one of their own in Diogo Jota.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Slot tended to stick with a trusted core of players in the Premier League last season. There is no disputing the methods of a coach who wins the title in his debut season at Liverpool with ease and four matches to spare, although Slot himself suspected fatigue played a part in theCarabao Cup final defeat by Newcastle.Ekitiké, a France Under-21 international who scored 22 goals in his one and only season at Eintracht, may not be Liverpool’s final signing of a statement summer. The Premier League champions remain keen on Crystal Palace’s central defender Marc Guéhi and there would be appetite for another forward should Bayern eventually succeed in their pursuit of Luis Díaz.Liverpool maintain Díaz is not for sale and that their €100m (£86.8m) valuation of the Colombia international is for accounting purposes rather than an asking price. That may be so but if that valuation is met and Díaz departs, and Liverpool get what they want for Darwin Núñez (£55m), Harvey Elliott (£40m-plus), Chiesa (£10m) and Tyler Morton (£15m), the club could yet recoup more than £200m before the transfer window closes on 1 September.

To the tournament and to my fans in Canada I am very sorry, I will see you next year!”‘Knee cooked’: Nick Kyrgios limps along road to recovery in return from injuryRead moreDraper revealed on Xthat he would also miss the Cincinnati Open starting 5 August. The British No 1 wrote: “After Wimbledon I picked up an injury in my left arm, nothing serious, but I have to make sure it recovers fully for the rest of the season. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to compete in Toronto and Cincinnati … see you in NYC!”Sinner is looks to protect his elbow, after a tumble in his fourth-round match against Grigor Dmitrov at Wimbledon. Djokovic also suffered niggling injuries throughout his run at the tournament, with a groin problem ultimately being the main reason he will be absent from Toronto.Alexander Zverev, the world No 3, and Taylor Fritz, ranked No 4, are likely to be the top seeds in Toronto.Many players have spoken out against the scheduling on both the men’s Association ofTennisProfessionals (ATP) and the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) tours. In March the Professional Tennis Players’ Association (PTPA), which was co-founded by Djokovic, began legal action against tennis’s governing bodies in the US, the UK and EU, in what it described as being “on behalf of the entire player population”.On 26 June the PTPA submitted an amended complaint, dropping the International Tennis Federation, which runs team events and the Olympic events, and the International Tennis Integrity Agency from the lawsuit, focusing solely on the ATP and WTA tours, despite the PTPA actively negotiating with all four grand slam tournaments.Meanwhile the Australian Nick Kyrgios came through his first match since March, and just his sixth this year, alongside the French veteran Gaël Monfils in the men’s doubles at the DC Open.They lost 2-6, 2-6to Édouard Roger-Vasselin and Hugo Nys.Explore more on these topicsTennisCarlos AlcaraznewsShareReuse this content"

Peter Beardsley’s performances in 2002 for Newcastle United were legendary, Jörg Albertz helped himself to a few more thunderb@stards for Rangers and how can we forget the vastly underrated Owen Coyle squealing “Coyle!” every time he took a shot. As they disappeared from our screens, charity fundraisers came to the fore. In Soccer Aid, Woody Harrelson being mobbed by Zinedine Zidane and Jens Lehmann after burying the winning penalty past England keeper Jamie Theakston for the Rest of the World XI was memorable, as wasa certain tackleby future UK prime minister Boris Johnson on former Manchester City cult hero Maurizio Gaudino.The point is, from half-time fan competitions (Tripgate, we’re looking at you) toKerlon’s seal dribbling, there is a lot of room for football-based silliness and ingenuity in a game saturated with monotonous tactics and refereeing segments. And with that in mind, Football Daily’s attention turns to Kasi Flava, a maverick offshoot of the game originating in South Africa, where entertainment and showboating are as important as scoring. Teams as varied as Covid-19 FC and former champions and fan favourites Skepe Nketole FC – nicknamed The Chopper Boys owing to their propensity to arrive at matches in helicopters – compete in tournaments for prizes that range from R250,000 (£10,500) cash to brandy or even sheep.Results, then, are important, but this is closer to an improvised, performative dance than a traditional match, an outpouring of joy played and watched by working-class people in the townships. “Kasi football is an art form, embedded in real-life human drama,” explains Tarminder Kaur, a senior lecturer at the University of Johannesburg. Bet you didn’t bank on reading actual quotes from an academic in Football Daily, but here we are.Surely the best clip of the recent DStv eKasi Champs of Champs tournament, broadcast live on national television, isthe winner scored by Mudagasiagainst Jukulyn in a 2-1 victory. Some of the moves are downright disrespectful: at one point Mudagasi’s players pretend to fall asleep on the ball, before their No 9 whips a genuinely brilliant Quaresma-esque trivela pass to a teammate, who neatly laces an expert finish into the far corner to send the crowd wild. Yes, please. Kasi football is not for everyone. And if you thinkRené Higuita should have just caught the ballat Wembley in 1995 and Yannick Bolasieshould have done less sweepingand more shooting, then this is probably not for you.

Two seasons ago, Bishop’s Stortford were members of the league, and they’re based at the end of Stansted airport’s runway. They used to love midweek games in the north-east. To extend the discussion, Merthyr Tydfil are playing in National League North this season, so where does north Wales start?” – Ray Simpson.Regarding Jon Millard’s submission that ‘the north starts at Sheffield, indisputably, as did football, also undisputedly. I’d love to say this is the one thing Noble will agree with me on, but he’d probably email in and say it’s bloody Woodall, or something’ (yesterday’s letters). He’s clearly right on football, indisputably. The north is more complex. When I was young, we used to just say that Chesterfield was the dividing line but then we thought that Bob Holness played the sax on Baker Street (false) and that he was the first person to play James Bond (false, he was the second) so what did we know? The north is very south Sheffield and just above Chesterfield so you’re looking more at a broad line of Killamarsh, Eckington, Lowedges, Totley. And, yes, that line includes Woodall” – Noble Francis.I see that, according to Jason Wilcox, new signing Bryan Mbeumo is ‘the perfect fit for Manchester United and the culture that we are developing’. That’s rather harsh criticism, isn’t it, on the lad’s first day?” – Phil Taverner.If you have any, please send letters tothe.boss@theguardian.com.Today’s winner of our prizeless letter o’ the day is … Phil Taverner.

I don’t think there’s anything progressive about spending £100bn a year, often to US hedge funds, when I would rather spend that money on the health service or on our defence or on better schools for our children.”In June’s public finance data, the ONS said the escalating cost of providing public services and a large increase in servicing the government’s outstanding debts outstripped rising income from taxes and national insurance contributions.Interest charges on central government debt rose by £8.4bn to £16.4bn from a year earlier, the second-highest June level on records going back to 1997, driven by higher index-linked gilt costs after a rise in the retail prices index measure of inflation.It comes as Reeves prepares for a tough autumn budget amid mounting speculation over the need for largetax risesto cover a multibillion-pound shortfall in the public finances after the government’s high-stakeswelfare U-turnearlier this month.Reeves acknowledged the U-turn had come at a price. “The OBR will do their costings in the autumn and set that out, probably to the tune of £5bn,” she said.UK borrowing chartMinisters have warned of “financial consequences” after the backtracking on disability benefits and winter fuel payments for pensioners.Alongside a sluggish economic outlook and possibledowngrade in productivity forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility(OBR) at the autumn budget, economists have said Reeves could face a £30bn shortfall against her fiscal rules.The UK economyshrank for two consecutive monthsin April and May, whileunemploymentandinflationhave risen, as businesses and households come under pressure from tax rises, elevated borrowing costs and global uncertainty amid Donald Trump’s trade war.Despite the June overshoot in borrowing, the sum borrowed over the first three months of the financial year was close to the level predicted by the OBR at the March spring statement. However, economists said tax rises were increasingly likely amid rising borrowing levels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Defence spending will almost certainly have to rise faster than the government currently planned, for instance, necessitating further tax hikes or rule tweaks.”Reeves has faced growing demands from Labour backbenchers, unions and the former party leader Neil Kinnock to consider introducing a wealth tax. However, the chancellor has so far sought to keep her options open while pushing to reassure business leaders that her priority remains driving up economic growth.Challenged by the former Tory chancellor Norman Lamont on Tuesday to rule out a wealth tax, Reeves said: “This is, with respect, what you would have done, and did do, in my position: you rightly said that tax is a matter for a budget and we’ll set out our policy then.”TheInstitute for Fiscal Studiessaid on Monday there was a “strong case” for the chancellor to tweak her self-imposed rule, which requires day-to-day spending to be matched by receipts by the fifth year of official forecasts.Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said Labour was spending money it did not have.“Labour’s jobs tax and reckless borrowing is killing growth and fuelling inflation – paving the way for more tax hikes and more borrowing in the autumn,” he said.“Make no mistake – working families will pay the price for Labour’s failure and costly U-turns.”According to the latest snapshot, public sector net debt, the sum of every annual borrowing figure, was estimated at 96.3% of GDP, one of its highest levels since the 1960s.The OBR warned earlier this month that the UK’s public finances wereon an unsustainable long-term trajectory, driven by rising debt levels, the growing cost of state pensions and the mounting climate emergency.Explore more on these topicsBudget deficitEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Flanagan Group did not respond to requests from the BBC and the Guardian for comment.McCluskey, who was Unite’s general secretary between 2010 and 2021, was a key player in the labour movement and the leading financial backer of Jeremy Corbyn when Corbyn was Labour leader.The spiralling costs of the Unite hotel inBirmingham, which was supposed to be a financial investment, have hung over the union for years. The Serious Fraud Office launched an inquiry into the project last year.Sharon Graham, who replaced McCluskey as general secretary, commissioned a specialist construction lawyer, Martin Bowdery KC, to investigate the project’s costs and accounts.A summary of his interim report, seen by the Guardian, said:The union spent “at least” £72m more than the hotel complex was worth.Unite awarded the Flanagan Group the contract to build the hotel with “no competitive tendering process” and despite the company “having a history of poor performance, delays … and cost overruns on previous contracts”.McCluskey described the company’s bosses as “good friends”.A £400,000 union loantowards the purchase of a £700,000 flat for McCluskeyhad not been authorised by the executive committee in advance.A statement from Carter-Ruck said McCluskey was “deeply disappointed” by the statements and report published by Unite, which McCluskey claims were issued without any prior reference.Regarding the flat loan, his lawyers said it was made in accordance with Unite’s home equity scheme. “At all relevant times, this scheme was open to all officers of the union, in recognition of the expectation that most, if not all, of Unite’s officers would (at that time) work from the union’s central offices in London,” the statement said.“We are instructed that the scheme did not require prior approval from the Executive Council on a case-by-case basis.”McCluskey’s lawyers said he was not aware of the concerns of staff or union lawyers at the time the construction contract was signed, did not recall signing the main contract and was not involved in the decision to select the Flanagan Group.His lawyers have said he categorically rejected any suggestion of improper dealings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said McCluskey received tickets for five Liverpool games in the UK, four of which included matchday hospitality.It said “the evidence for this comes from tickets and flight information sent to Len McCluskey’s Unite email”.McCluskey’s lawyers told the BBC he paid for his travel in full and recalled travelling with a commercial carrier on one of the flights.They said he occasionally attended football matches with the Flanagans but invariably paid his way and did not believe he attended all the domestic matches detailed in Unite’s report.Initial estimates for the hotel project in 2012 suggested it would cost around £7m.In the end, Flanagan Group was paid a £96m for its work on the four-star hotel and conference centre, which opened for business in 2021.In his report, Bowdery said £30m of that was overcharging and the company submitted bills “massively over the original estimates”.In one instance it is claimed the company charged £1.3m for work that should have cost £90,000.The Flanagan Group was also paid £3.7m for adverse weather delays even though it was “not entitled to extra payments for adverse weather”, the report states.The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment but has previously told the BBC it was proud of its work on the scheme and costs had risen because of “radical changes to design and working practices”.According to the report, McCluskey said the decision to appoint the Flanagan Group was made by Unite’s former finance director, Ed Sabisky, who died in March 2020. The report said that McCluskey signed the main contract.Explore more on these topicsLen McCluskeyTrade unionsLiverpoolBirminghamnewsShareReuse this content"

But research has revealed Manchester’s Royal Exchange building was at the centre of slavery and colonialism, making it “one of the most important locations in the history of global capitalism”.Since 1973, the building in St Ann’s Square has been home to the Royal Exchange theatre, now stagingLiberation(until 26 July), the critically acclaimed play marking 80 years since the1945 Pan-African Congress– a conference that brought together luminaries of Black liberation, including Kwame Nkrumah, Jomo Kenyatta and WEB Du Bois,in Manchesterto progress national independence movements from European rule.View image in fullscreenEamonn Walker, as George Padmore, and Eric Kofi Abrefa, as Kwame Nkrumah, in the play Liberation at the Royal Exchange.Photograph: Isha Shah PhotographyBut while the theatre celebrates African liberation, the building, in its former life, was at the heart of European colonial dominance. As a 19th-century trading hall it was the place where “Manchester’s businessmen, industrialists, financiers, and politicians made decisions and deals that transformed landscapes and environments across continents”,research into the building’s historyfound.The research, a series of reports involving the University of Manchester (UoM)emerging scholars programme, reveals how the Royal Exchange’s 19th-century subscribers were enmeshed in the enslavement of African peoples, the exploitation of India, the opium trade in China, as well as the development of the economic doctrine of free trade, the birth of the modern city, and thedevelopment of liberal politicsand economics.Crucially, the reports shine a light on how African people resisted enslavement, fighting a plantation economy that British elites were at the heart of.The research looks into the story ofJack Gladstone,an enslaved man on the Success sugar plantation in modern-day Guyana, and his father, Quamina, who led up to 13,000 people demanding freedom in 1823’s Demerara Uprising before it was violently suppressed.View image in fullscreenIllustrated account of the Demerara Uprising, which broke out on 18 August 1823 in Guyana.Photograph: John Carter Brown LibrarySuccess was owned byJohn Gladstone, the father of the 19th-century prime minister William Gladstone, whose wealth derived from enslavement, colonialism and compensation payments after 1833’s Slavery Abolition Act. Members of the Gladstone family played a key role in funding the Royal Exchange building, which was Manchester’s third exchange building, completed in 1874.The story of Sandy, an African prince who staged a rebellion against enslavement in Tobago in 1770, is also highlighted. Sandy’s rebellion was suppressed with the help of Lord Ducie, a Manchester landowner and Royal Navy officer who sold the land at Market Street on which Manchester’s second exchange, a forerunner to the current Royal Exchange site, opened in 1809.View image in fullscreenJohn Gladstone, the owner of the Success plantation in modern-day Guyana.Photograph: AlamyDucie, also known as Francis Reynolds-Moreton, was the grandson of Thomas Reynolds, a director of the South Sea Company that formed in 1711 and secured exclusive rights from the British government to traffic and sell 4,800 enslaved people annually to Spanish colonies throughout the Americas.Facilitated by Ducie’s land sale, the 1809 exchange replaced the first Manchester exchange – which had been built in 1729 by Sir Oswald Mosley, an ancestor of the20th-century fascist leader Oswald Mosley– creating an “exclusive space” for dealmaking, the researcher Destinie Reynolds found. Mosley Street and Great Ducie Street in Manchester memorialise these family names.The second exchange professionalised commodities trading at a time when Manchester’s cotton industry was booming – fuelled by crops planted, grown, picked and packed by African people enslaved and transported to the Americas, often by merchants from nearby Liverpool.Consequently, key, founding players in the second exchange – granted the “Royal” title when Queen Victoria visited in 1851 – were traders in enslaved people, and plantation owners who “used their power and influence to lobby in favour of the slave trade and reduce tariffs on (its) goods … helping to continue its growth”, advancing the “liberal” case for free trade simultaneously, the researcher Beth Carson found.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This included commissioning a poem, Holding Space, from the Manchester writer Keisha Thompson (who is now the programme manager for theGuardian’s Legacies of Enslavement team), which explored the building’s story, in its Great Hall.The Royal Exchange theatre said of the most recent research into the building’s past: “While reclaiming this space was a radical act, we must acknowledge how this grand empty building came to be here. The building’s very existence is a testament … to the colossal profits of a global cotton economy … one of the most important locations in the history of global capitalism.”Dr Kerry Pimblott, of UoM, added: “We believe centring such accounts … raises important questions about the legacies of this history in the present and how reparative action can help shape more just futures.”Explore more on these topicsManchesterCotton Capital: ongoing seriesSlaveryBlack British cultureReparations and reparative justiceGreater ManchesterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s like a super-smart, capable person. There’s no phone tree, there’s no transfers. It can do everything that any customer support agent at that company could do. It does not make mistakes. It’s very quick. You call once, the thing just happens, it’s done.”TheOpenAIfounder then turned to healthcare, making the suggestion that AI’s diagnostic capabilities had surpassed human doctors, but wouldn’t go so far as to accept the superior performer as the sole purveyor of healthcare.“ChatGPT today, by the way, most of the time, can give you better – it’s like, a better diagnostician than most doctors in the world,” he said. “Yet people still go to doctors, and I am not, like, maybe I’m a dinosaur here, but I really do not want to, like, entrust my medical fate toChatGPTwith no human doctor in the loop.”His visit to Washington was aligned with the Trump administration’s unveiling of its “AI action plan”, which is focused defining and easing some regulations and promoting more datacenters. Altman’s latest engagement is with the federal government under Donald Trump, which has taken on a new tune compared with years past. While much has changed with the tech over the years, under the Biden administration, OpenAI and its rivals asked the government to regulate AI. Meanwhile under Trump, they talk of accelerating to beat China.At the fireside chat, he said one of his biggest worries was over AI’s rapidly advancing destructive capabilities, with one scenario that kept him up at night being a hostile nation using these weapons to attack the US financial system. And despite being in awe of advances in voice cloning, Altman warned the crowd about how that same benefit could enable sophisticated fraud and identity theft, considering that “there are still some financial institutions that will accept the voiceprint as authentication”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Solar power is about 41% cheaper than the lowest-cost fossil fuel alternative, and onshore wind generation is less than half the price of fossil fuels, according to areport from the International Renewable Energy Agency.Costs have been driven down by the increasingly widespread use of the technologies, a huge focus on low-carbon manufacturing inChina, and burgeoning investment in the sector, reaching $2tn last year – which was $800bn more than went into fossil fuels, and an increase of 70% in the last decade.The UN secretary general,António Guterres, said: “We are on the cusp of a new era. Fossil fuels are running out of road. The sun is rising on a clean energy age.”Guterres said countries seeking energy security against geopolitical threats and lower costs for consumers amid a global cost-of-living crisis must choose renewables. “The greatest threat to energy security today is fossil fuels. They leave economies and people at the mercy of price shocks, supply disruptions and geopolitical turmoil,” he said. “There are no price spikes for sunlight. No embargos on wind.”Energy demand is still rising, however, driven by the demand for cooling as temperatures rise beyond bearable levels in many countries, and by the soaring demand for powerfor IT datacentres,including for AI. If even a proportion of this increase is devoted to fossil fuels it will become impossible to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, ascountries have vowed to do.Energy demands from AI datacentres to quadruple by 2030, says reportRead moreThe secretary general called on big technology companies to commit to sourcing 100% of their electricity demands from low-carbon generation by 2030.Nearly every country isnow obliged to come up with a new national planon greenhouse gas emissions under the2015 Paris climate agreement. Guterres said it made economic sense for countries to use those plans, due in September, to funnel support into low-carbon energy, and reduce the billions in subsidies that still go to fossil fuels.“This transformation is fundamentally about energy security and people’s security. It’s about smart economics,” he said in a speech in New York, which was delayed from last month by Israel’s attack on Iran. “We have passed the point of no return [to fossil fuels].”Francesco La Camera, the director general of Irena, said: “The cost-competitiveness of renewables is today’s reality. New renewable power outcompetes fossil fuels on cost, offering a clear path to affordable, secure and sustainable energy.”Fossil fuel interests are still strong in many countries. In the US, incentives for clean power have beencut by Donald Trump, who is seeking to boost coal, gas and oil. In China,new coal-fired power stations are still being planned, despite the country’s strong showing on renewables, and in March, India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, celebrated the country’s billionth tonne of coal production.La Camera said: “Progress [on renewables] is not guaranteed. Rising geopolitical tensions, trade tariffs, and material supply constraints threaten to slow the momentum and drive up costs.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Although renewable generation is increasing rapidly around the world, investments in electricity grids are failing to keep up. For every $1 invested in generation, only about 60 cents is invested in national grids. For the energy transition needed, the investments need to be roughly at parity.Clearing Gaza rubble could yield 90,000 tonnes of planet-heating emissionsRead moreGuterres’s speechmarked a change in tone for the UN secretary general, who has raised the alarm in increasingly stark terms over the climate crisis in recent years. He warned in the Guardian in 2022 thatthe world would be “doomed”if climate talks failed; in 2023 he said“the era of global boiling”had arrived; last year he called fossil fuel companies“the godfathers of climate chaos”.This fresh intervention takes a notably more upbeat tone, focusing on the economic benefits of a shift to clean energy.Bill Hare, chief executive of the Climate Analytics thinktank, said investors and governments should take note: “Any investment in new fossil fuels now is a fool’s gamble, while joining the race to renewables can only bring benefits – not just jobs and cheaper energy at stable prices, but energy independence and access where it’s needed most. Developing regions like Africa have huge energy access needs, and even bigger renewable resources. What they need now is international finance to share in the renewables revolution.”Kaysie Brown, associate director at the E3G thinktank, called for countries to bring forward strong national climate plans before the UN’sCop30summit in Brazil this November. “The world now has both the technical solutions and the economic imperative to accelerate the clean energy transition – a transition essential for global stability and shared prosperity,” she said. “But unlocking this opportunity demands bold leadership and deeper cooperation.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisUnited NationsAntónio GuterresRenewable energyWind powerFossil fuelsSolar powernewsShareReuse this content"

From a high, rocky ledge on Khortytsia Island, the view opens on to a sea of swaying young willows and mirrored lagoons. Some of the trees are already many metres tall, but this is a young forest. Just a few years ago, all of it was under water.“This isVelykyi Luh– the Great Meadow,” says Valeriy Babko, a retired history teacher and army veteran, standing on the former reservoir shoreline at Malokaterynivka village. For him, this extraordinary new-old environment represents more than nature alone.“It is an ancient, mythic terrain, woven through Ukrainian folklore,” he says. “Think of all those Cossacks galloping through its valleys of forests so dense the sun barely pierced them.”That historic landscape vanished in 1956, when the Soviet Union completed the Kakhovka dam and hydroelectric power plant and flooded the entire region. What had once been an ecological and cultural cradle became a reservoir, and its rich, living systems were entombed beneath the water.View image in fullscreenWater flows over the collapsed Kakhovka dam on 7 June 2023. Photograph: APThen, in 2023, thatwater was unleashed as weapon: the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River, under the control of Russian forces, was blown up (Russia denies bombing it). It sent a vast, destructive flood of water and sediment downstream, destroying villages and killing an unknown number of people; figures for the death toll range from a few dozen into thehundreds.Up to one million people lost access to drinking water. Two years on from the disaster, the reservoir’s future still hangs in the balance. Scientists say it represents both a “return to life” for the ecosystem and wild creatures that inhabit it – and an unpredictable, potentially toxic “timebomb”. It is a case study in the complexity of how nature responds to vast changes wrought by humankind – and what happens to ecosystems in the wake of disaster.Spontaneous regenerationIn the immediate aftermath of the bombing, Kakhovka reservoir resembled a desert of drying mud and cracked silt. Now, plants grow so thickly you must scythe through the vegetation covering the earth embankment before the basin comes fully into view.A sliding image that shows changes to the landscape as water drains away from the reservoir.When the Kakhovka dam was breached on 6 June 2023, water from the adjacent reservoir surged into the Dnipro River toward the city of Kherson and the Black Sea, causing severe flooding downstream. Floodwaters began to recede after a few weeks, but a slower-moving problem has unfolded in southern Ukraine as networks of canals once fed by the Kakhovka reservoir run dry. Credit: OLI on Landsat 8 and OLI-2 on Landsat 9/NasaThe bone-dry former shoreline is studded with husks and shells of aquatic organisms that once lived here. Beyond it, a vast sea of young trees stretches over the horizon towards the occupiedZaporizhzhia nuclear power station. The size of it is difficult to take in: the reservoir’s surface area was 2,155 sq km (832 sq miles) – bigger than New York City and its five boroughs.A map showing the Nova Kakhovka dam and the area previously submerged under the reservoir.The latest report from theUkrainian War Environmental Consequences Work Group (UWEC)confirms what satellite images, ecologists and field researchers began to observe over the past two years: the ecosystem of the lower Dnipro is not only recovering, it is evolving. The drained reservoir is now home to dense growths of willow and poplar and enormous wetlands; endangered sturgeon have returned to waterways; wild boar and mammals to the forests; and there are signs of spontaneous regeneration across a huge stretch of floodplain.“We are witnessing the emergence of a massive natural floodplain forest system,” says Oleksiy Vasyliuk, co-author of a2025 reporton the reservoir for the UWEC and head of the Ukrainian Nature Conservation Group. “It is not a managed project. It is the land itself returning to life.”View image in fullscreenInstead of an artificial lake on their doorsteps, Malokaterynivka residents have a new forest landscape to contend with. Photograph: Vincent MundyThat return is increasingly measurable for ecologists. “Native fauna are returning to the section of the river freed from the dam and reservoir,” the report confirms. “As well as a rapid expansion of native vegetation, as many as 40bn tree seeds have sprouted, which could lead to the formation of the largest floodplain forest in Ukraine’s steppe zone.”According to Eugene Simonov, international coordinator at Rivers without Boundaries, what is unfolding in Velykyi Luh is not just a local wetland rebound, it is the rare and spontaneous reconstitution of a vast riverine ecosystem, with implications that stretch far beyondUkraine.“Prior to the dam, the Dnipro floodplain here hosted huge oak forests and many types of wetlands over thousands of square kilometers, creating a mosaic of biodiversity-rich habitats for hundreds of bird species and gigantic fish such as the Ukrainian sturgeon, which used to come here to spawn,” Simonov says.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenClockwise from top left: Critically endangered sturgeon are returning to their ancient spawning grounds; billions of freshwater clams died when the reservoir emptied; young sturgeon at a caviar aquaculture facility – a small wild population is now found in the Dnipro; the fountains in Dubovy Gai (Oak Park), which will not work again now the water supply has dried up, says Valeriy Babko, pictured; the floodplain is littered with the remains of aquatic organisms. Photographs: Vincent MundyThe Great Meadow, he says, also represents an opportunity for Ukraine as it seeks to attract global funds for postwar recovery and join the EU. “Restoring natural freshwater ecosystems along a 250-km stretch of the lower Dnipro could be the largest project of its kind in Europe and has the potential to become Ukraine’s decisive contribution to meeting EU commitments to restore rivers to their natural state by 2030,” he says.Yet, as scientists are quick to emphasise, this recovery is not guaranteed. Much of the former reservoir remains inaccessible due to active shelling and mined terrain. Comprehensive biological monitoring is difficult. Heavy metals and chemical contamination are a growing concern for researchers. And the future of the area remains politically uncertain.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenClockwise from top left: trees sprout from the basin of the former reservoir; Vadym Maniuk, ecologist, surveys the dense growth; white willows and black poplars have grown rapidly, turning the area into forest; some of the trees have already grown many metres tall. Photographs: Vincent Mundy and Alessio MamoA ‘toxic timebomb’While the reservoir forest looks like an oasis, sprung up in the absence of people, it is still marked by the residue of human enterprise. Over time, the banks of the reservoir eroded. Their fine particles of dust sank into a thick layer at the basin’s floor. At the same time, pollutants were entering the water – particularly heavy metals from industrial enterprises along and upstream of the reservoir.Oleksandra Shumilova, a freshwater ecologist, says: “All these pollutants were absorbed into these fine particles that were deposited on the bottom.” The sediment acted “like an enormous sponge that was accumulated on the bottom of this reservoir. We estimate that it was about 1.5 cubic km of polluted sediments”.View image in fullscreenThe industrial chimneys of Zaporizhzhia tower over the ancient Scythian burial monuments of Khortytsia island. Photograph: Vincent MundyWhen the dam was drained it sent an enormous quantity of polluted, potentially toxic waste flowing into the wider area. Its heavy metals could easily contaminate water sources, soil, and be taken up by plants. Even in small concentrations, they can “have negative effects on various systems of human organisms; for example, they can cause cancer, endocrine disruptions, problems with lungs, with kidneys,” Shumilova says. She compares their effects to radiation: as those toxins move up the food chain, they can concentrate, causing particular problems for bigger animals and meat eaters.‘Mother Nature recovers amazingly fast’: reviving Ukraine’s rich wetlandsRead more“As for how these pollutants are also transferred within the food web, it’s not known. It is not possible to investigate at the moment, because it’s dangerous to enter the area. There is no systematic research,” she says.View image in fullscreenWith the Dnipro River’s water table permanently altered, the artificially fed ponds in Dubovy Gai are expected to be fully dried out by the end of the summer. Photograph: Vincent MundyA 2025 report co-authored by Shumilova and publishedin the journal Scienceconcluded that the pollutants represented a “toxic timebomb”, and warned of significant concerns for animal food webs and human populations living in the area. But, as in other environments – such as the site of the Chornobyl nuclear disaster –contamination and natural regenerationcan occur side by side. In the same paper, the scientists concluded that within five years, 80% of the ecosystem functions lost to the dam’s presence will be restored and that the floodplain’s biodiversity would recover significantly within two years.A rare opportunityThe UWEC report frames this moment as a strategic turning point for Ukraine’s environmental and cultural policy. If left to regenerate, the site could become one of Europe’s largest contiguous freshwater ecosystems, rivalling even theDanube delta in ecological importance. But the emerging forest at Kakhovka could disappear as quickly as it emerged.If Ukraine chooses to protect Velykyi Luh, it won’t just be saving a landscape, it will be choosing to believe in its own futureEugene Simonov“If the hydropower dam is rebuilt,” Vasyliuk warns, “this young forest and all the life it now sustains will be lost again.”The state energy company Ukrhydroenergo has alreadysignalled its intention to reconstructthe Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. For some officials, this represents a return to “normality”: a reinstatement of industrial productivity, energy security and geopolitical control.“Rebuilding the dam the way it was would not be a recovery,” says Vasyliuk, “it would be an ecocide. It would destroy a young, spontaneous forest before we even have a chance to understand it.”The decision holds significance beyond Ukraine’s borders. Roughly 80% of the territory affected by the reservoir’s collapse lies within nationally and internationally protected zones, many of them part ofEurope’s Emerald Network, placing the fate of Velykyi Luh within a larger continental mandate to safeguard ecological and cultural heritage.View image in fullscreenPeople fish in the river, which dropped by several metres after the dam was destroyed. Photograph: Vincent MundyFrom a climate perspective, the newly forming ecosystem offers significant potential for carbon capture and storage, the 2025 UWEC report concludes.“This is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss,” says Simonov. “If Ukraine chooses to protect Velykyi Luh, it won’t just be saving a landscape, it will be choosing to believe in its own future.”Vasyliuk adds: “This is our biocultural sovereignty at stake and that means our nature, our identity, our independence, and a symbol of the kind of nation we want to become.”Across the lower Dnipro, warblers nest in reeds where water once lapped against concrete and sturgeon spawn in shallows they haven’t visited in 70 years. The new wetland echoes an ancient rhythm.“What will happen with this area? We cannot predict at the moment with full confidence, but it’s true that it is reestablishing very rapidly,” says Shumilova.“From a human point of view it was, of course, a disaster for people living there. But from a scientific point of view, it’s a very rare event: how an ecosystem [can be] re-established. It is a big natural experiment. And it is still ongoing.”View image in fullscreenBeyond the riprap (rocks placed at the shoreline to control erosion) of the former reservoir the new forest emerges.

Russia accounted for 39% of allegations, followed by Ukraine and Kazakhstan. No abuse allegations were found for the four EU member states included in the analysis – Croatia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – or for Moldova and Turkmenistan.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The tension has been heightened by concerns about energy security since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which exposed Europe’s over-reliance on Russian gas, and China’s dominance of the critical mineral supply chain.Skybenko said: “Workers, communities and human rights defenders are facing a concerning number of growing risks – seemingly being forgotten as the world races to secure the minerals necessary for the urgent transition to clean energy.”Explore more on these topicsMiningCommoditiesEuropean UnionClimate crisisEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

This is a natural disaster … ” Malinauskas said.“There are over 400 different species of marine life that have been killed off or have had deaths as a result of this algal bloom.”According to records,it has killed over 13,800 animals, but experts predict the figure is much higher.Malinauskas said he used the words natural disaster “quite deliberately” but that the disaster differed from other emergencies, such as bushfires, that Australians were familiar with.“This is so entirely unprecedented we don’t really know how it’s going to play out over coming weeks and months ahead,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She confirmed she would also move this week for the establishment of a parliamentary inquiry into the algal bloom disaster.“It is South Australia’s beaches that are today being littered with the rotting carcasses of marine life and thousands of fish, dolphins, other marine life,” she said.“It’s Adelaide beaches today, but it could be Bondi tomorrow, and that is why we need rules and responses that are fit for the crisis we face, the modern issues that we need to grapple with, these challenges that are facing us.”On Monday night, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said federal funding had been timed “appropriately” given the event was unfolding “primarily in state waters”.“Events do occur in our environment,” the prime minister told ABC’s 7.30. “What is important is that there be a response.

A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence said: “It remains a long-standing UK and Nato policy to neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons at a given location.”One expert, William Alberque, a former director of Nato’s Arms Control, Disarmament and WMD Non-Proliferation Centre, said “the evidence is overwhelming” to conclude that B61 nuclear bombs have been transported to RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk.He cited other specialists who had tracked an unusual C-17 transport flight last week from the US air force base at Kirtland, New Mexico, which hosts a repository of an estimated 2,500 nuclear weapons, to Lakenheath.Taking off on Thursday, the transport plane landed in the UK on Friday and flew with its transponders on, meaning its flight was visible. The flight was operated by the 62nd Airlift Wing, the only US air force unit authorised to transport nuclear weapons.Similar flights also took place last week to air bases in Belgium and the Netherlands, home to long established “nuclear sharing” missions – where American tactical nuclear weapons are stored at European air bases.How and why is Britain obtaining access to nuclear gravity bombs?Read moreThough the UK announced at last month’s Nato summit thatthe RAF would purchase F-35A fighter jets, capable of carrying nuclear weapons, the likely transfer to Lakenheath is thought to have taken place several years before that deal will be completed.Hans Kristensen, nuclear information project director at the Federation of American Scientists, said he believed it was possible a deployment of nuclear weapons had taken place, and would come after a modernisation of the underground storage facilities at the Lakenheath base.The “addition of weapons to Lakenheath would mean the number of US tactical nuclear weapons in Europe has been increased for the first time since the cold war” from approximately 100 bombs “to probably 125-130”, Kristensen said.It would also indicate that “Nato has changed its policy of not responding with new nuclear weapons to Russia’s nuclear threats and behaviour”, he added.The B61-12 is a relatively simple gravity bomb that must be flown and dropped over its target. It comes in four variants, only one of which is more powerful than the 15kt weapon used to bomb Hiroshima in 1945. It has an explosive yield of 50kt, while the others are 0.3kt, 1.5kt and 10kt.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has prompted a remilitarisation in Europe, and Nato allies agreed last month at the Nato summit to lift core defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2035.The weapons are expected to be stored for the US air force 493rd squadron, nicknamed the Grim Reapers, based at Lakenheath. Last week, members of the unit were selling adistinctive commemorative coinat the Royal International Air Tattoo, with a heavyhanded clue that their mission had changed.Photographed by Tony Osborne, a journalist with Aviation Week, the coin comes in the shape of mushroom cloud. One side features a skull, a large missile, and the inscription “prepare to meet thy maker” – while the other shows an explosion.“It’s quite an overt way of saying yes,” Osborne said. The coin was sold out by the second day of the air show, the journalist added, such was its popularity among those attending the event at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire.Explore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsMilitaryKeir StarmerDefence policynewsShareReuse this content"

Javon Riley, 33, is on trial at the Old Bailey, where he has pleaded not guilty to four charges of attempted murder and an alternative charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent against the girl, who cannot be named because of her age.The prosecutor, James Mulholland KC, said the shooting was “a planned assassination of members of a rival gang by Mr Riley and others”.In his opening note, he said: “The shooting appears to have been part of an ongoing dispute between two rival groups in London known as the Tottenham Turks and the Hackney Turks, also known as the Bombacilars, which translates to the Bombers, although the immediate reason for it was unknown.“These two gangs have had an intense rivalry for well over a decade which has involved the use of extreme violence towards one another during that period and it is the prosecution case that what was intended was the murder of whomever was targeted.”Three men – Mustafa Kiziltan, Kenan Aydogdu and Nasser Ali – were shot in various parts of their bodies while sitting with others on a pavement table outside the busy restaurant. Those seated outside Evin had affiliations towards the Hackney Turks and the ones who ordered the shooting were from the Tottenham Turks, the prosecutor said.“Some of the bullets missed the men. One of these tragically struck a nine-year-old girl in the head and lodged in her brain. She had been sitting at a table inside the restaurant with other members of her family,” he added.The men have made “reasonable” recoveries but the impact upon the girl has been “far greater”, Mulholland said.“The first of several intensive operations upon her took place at Great Ormond Street hospital the day after the shooting to seek to address the damage caused by the bullet. Sections of her skull were removed to relieve swelling to the brain and these have since been replaced with a titanium plate,” he said.“She was in hospital for three months before being allowed to return home. Although she has made a relatively good recovery, she will continue to have physical and cognitive difficulties throughout her life.”The prosecutor said examination of CCTV footage at the restaurant shows that the first of the six shots struck the girl on the right side of her head, causing her to fall to the floor.The prosecutor said Riley was “vital in the carrying out of the plan to kill” and played a “key role” before, during and after the shooting. Riley allegedly carried out extensive reconnaissance, transported the gunman from the scene and was involved in the disposal of the firearm which he may also have provided. The weapon was never found.Riley was the subject of police surveillance after the shooting and covert recordings allegedly show he had access to a firearm and was “intimately aware” of what happened on 29 May 2024. During a conversation on 3 August 2024, Riley said “his man had ‘missed’, and that the result had been the shooting of a young girl”, Mulholland said.The prosecutor said Riley also had discussions referring to a man called Izzet Eren, who was linked to the Tottenham Turks and was shot in Moldova on 10 July 2024 in what was believed to be a revenge attack.Mulholland told the jury: “You will hear in conversations covertly recorded in a car used by Javon Riley some time after the shooting that, although he was not a member of the Tottenham Turks, he clearly knew of them and was linked to them and that they were behind the shooting.”The court heard that after the shooting, the gunman rode the motorbike to a nearby street where Riley was waiting in a stolen Nissan Juke displaying false plates. They then “calmly” headed to north London before transferring into Riley’s Range Rover.Riley, who denies all charges, was arrested last August.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

They are in Aberdeen, Brighton, Camden, Dundee, Leeds North Street, Oxford,Sheffield, Shepherd’s Bush, Shoreditch and York.Taylor, who took over as chief executive less than five months ago, said that “despite our best efforts”, it was not able to make the bars viable “due to their size, location and other limiting factors”.He wrote: “Following much consideration, we have sadly concluded that there is no realistic prospect of making these venues commercially viable.” The bars are due to close on Saturday.“Keeping them open would put pressure on the wider business, making it harder to invest where we know we can grow. This decision is not simply a response to the challenging UK hospitality market, but a proactive decision to redefine the bar division’s focus.”BrewDog, which is based in Aberdeenshire, said it employed more than 3,000 people worldwide in 2023 after aperiod of significant expansion.The business was founded as a “punk” challenger brand by the entrepreneurs James Watt and Martin Dickie in 2006 in Dickie’s mother’s garage in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, and has expanded to supply beer to supermarkets, open bars andopen hotels.The company declined to comment on how many staff could lose their jobs, but said it was going through a “meaningful and appropriate consultation process” with everyone affected. This process will last at least two weeks, it said, with one-to-one meetings for every person at risk.A spokesperson forBrewDogsaid: “We are working hard to minimise the impact on our people, and we expect to redeploy many affected team members across the BrewDog network.”News of the closures comes as the hospitality sector faces growing cost pressures, with higher national insurance contributions and increases to the living wage.The hotel and pub chain Oakman Inns recently went into administration, according to reports. The Hertfordshire-based chain has closed six sites, resulting in 159 job losses, its administrator, PwC, told theBBC.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the suit and in aninterviewwith the New York Times, Barnett said LaBeouf, whom she dated from 2018 t0 2019 after meeting on the set of his semi-autobiographical film Honeyboy, knowingly exposed her to a sexually transmitted infection, attempted to strangle her and slammed her against a car. LaBeouf denied all allegations of wrongdoing.Barnett’s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, and LaBeouf’s lawyer, Shawn Holley, released a joint statement on the settlement: “Committed to forging a constructive path forward, we have agreed to settle our case out of court. While the details of the settlement will remain private, we wish each other personal happiness, professional success and peace in the future.”The case had dragged on for years with little movement, with both sides going back and forth over the production of text messages and other evidence. It was originally scheduled to go to trial last year, but was postponed multiple times.In 2024, LaBeouf, 39, revealed that Barnett was seeking $10m, a number his team attempted to dismiss as excessive, citing Barnett’s continued music career. In a statement, his lawyer also cited Barnett’s role in the 2024 film The Crow, a modeling campaign for Calvin Klein and appearances in magazines such as Elle and British Vogue as evidence against the damages sought.At the time, Barnett’s lawyer responded: “While my client was led to believe that LaBeouf was on a path of taking responsibility and working a program, it is clear he intends his pattern of continuing to abuse the victim.“Any suggestion that FKA twigs’ emotional distress should be discounted because of any career success is preposterous and discounts the idea that victims should have hope for the future,” he added. “Logically, without the trauma that she has suffered, I can only imagine the level of success she would have achieved by now.”The rapturous return of FKA twigs: ‘I grew up feeling my body could do anything’Read moreIn a separate filing, her lawyer disputed LaBeouf’s claim that the singer was thriving due to the success of her career. “[LaBeouf] argues that if [twigs] is working and making income, then she does not suffer from emotional distress. This is simply not true,” the filing read. “A person’s ability to make money, particularly how much money, is not correlated to a person’s emotional distress damages.”In her interview with the Times, Barnett said she came forward publicly to show how even a critically acclaimed artist with money and a support network can experience domestic abuse. “I’d like to be able to raise awareness on the tactics that abusers use to control you and take away your agency,” she said at the time. The Times also interviewed another former girlfriend of LaBeouf’s, who described a similar pattern.Before the court case, LaBeouf responded broadly to the two women’s stories: “I’m not in any position to tell anyone how my behavior made them feel,” he said in an email to the New York Times. “I have no excuses for my alcoholism or aggression, only rationalizations. I have been abusive to myself and everyone around me for years. I have a history of hurting the people closest to me. I’m ashamed of that history and am sorry to those I hurt. There is nothing else I can really say.”LaBeouf went on to star in Abel Ferrara’s 2022 film Padre Pio, as well as Francis Ford Coppola’s critically panned opus Megalopolis, released in 2024. This year, he appeared in the boxing drama Salvable.Barnett’s latest album, Eusexua, was released in January. The Guardiandescribedit as “a hymn to the healing power of the dancefloor”.Explore more on these topicsFKA twigsShia LaBeoufnewsShareReuse this content"

It has also continued to fund humanitarian support.The impact assessment said these and other key decisions had “protected against disproportionate impacts on equalities”. However, it highlighted the fact that bilateral projects in a string of countries face cuts, including on education and health.“In Africa, spending is reduced in women’s health, health systems strengthening, and health emergency response, eg in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia,” the impact assessment said.As an example, it warns that cuts to the budget of the Ending Preventable Deaths support programme will result in the “reduction and prioritisation” of support across 11 countries.Superbugs could kill millions more and cost $2tn a year by 2050, models showRead moreThe assessment concludes: “Overall, any reductions to health spending risk an increase in disease burden and ultimately in deaths, impacting in particular those living in poverty, women, children and people with disabilities.”On education, it finds “in-year reductions to education spend are envisaged in Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and in Zimbabwe, and a girls’ education programme in DRC will close early in 2025 to 2026”.It adds: “Adverse impacts on children will be likely, including the most vulnerable and children with disabilities, eg the early closure of the DRC education programme will have negative impacts on 170,000 children in post-conflict rural Kasai.”The impact assessment also pointed out that 11 of the 13 current or future programmes that have been earmarked for closure were “equalities focused”.The slashing of the UK development assistance budget comes as Donald Trump’s administration institutes its own sweepingcuts to US aid, which, among other crushing effects on the world’s poorest people, have resulted inabrupt haltsto life-saving HIV drug programmes in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa.The FCDO assessment was published alongsidethe department’s annual report, which set out more details of how the diminished aid budget will be spent.Lisa Wise, director of global policy at Save the Children UK, said: “The government has confirmed our worst fears – significant reductions in aid spending will result in deaths of the world’s most vulnerable, including children.”She welcomed the confirmation that the government will meet its promise of funding to the World Bank, but added: “International spending must be part of a genuine strategic approach – where the needs of people facing inequality and at risk of crisis are at the heart of development, not one driven by balancing the books.”Gideon Rabinowitz, director of policy and advocacy atBond, the umbrella group for development NGOs, said: “The world’s most marginalised communities, particularly those experiencing conflict, and women and girls, will pay the highest price for these political choices.”He added that the impact assessment only covers the current year, and urged the government to repeat the exercise, as the cuts continue to bite.“Without this, we only have a very limited picture of what the real impact is going to be on the areas facing the brunt of the cuts,” he said.Jenny Chapman, the development minister, said: “We are modernising our approach to international development. Every pound must work harder for UK taxpayers and the people we help around the world and these figures show how we are starting to do just that through having a clear focus and priorities.“The UK is moving towards a new relationship with developing countries, becoming partners and investors, rather than acting as a traditional aid donor.”She has previouslydescribed an aid budget of 0.3% of national income as the “new normal”.The previous Labour government adopted a target of 0.7% of national income for aid spending, which subsequently won cross-party support – butRishi Sunak cut it to 0.5% during the Covid pandemic.Explore more on these topicsAidLabourAfricaUSAIDnewsShareReuse this content"

Schools were closed – most had been turned into shelters – and all 12 of the strip’s universities were partially or fully destroyed.Against that backdrop, a prestigious American education journal decided to dedicate a special issue to “education and Palestine”. The Harvard Educational Review (HER) put out a call for submissions, asking academics around the world for ideas for articles grappling with the education of Palestinians, education about Palestine and Palestinians, and related debates in schools and colleges in the US.“The field of education has an important role to play in supporting students, educators, and policymakers in contextualizing what has been happening in Gaza with histories and continuing impacts of occupation, genocide, and political contestations,” the journal’s editors wrote in their call for abstracts.Jewish organizers are increasingly confronting Trump: ‘The repression is growing, but so is the resistance’Read moreA little more than a year later, the scale of destruction in Gaza was exponentially larger. The special issue, which was slated to be published this summer, was just about ready – contracts with most authors were finalized and articles were edited. They covered topics from the annihilation of Gaza’s schools to the challenges of teaching about Israel and Palestine in the US.But on 9 June, the Harvard Education Publishing Group, the journal’s publisher, abruptly canceled the release. In an email to the issue’s contributors, the publisher cited “a number of complex issues”, shocking authors and editors alike, the Guardian has learned.US universities have come under intensifying attacks from theTrump administrationover accusations of tolerating antisemitism on campuses. Many have responded by restricting protest, punishing students and faculty outspoken about Palestinian rights, and scrutinizing academic programs home to scholarship about Palestine.But the cancellation of an entire issue of an academic journal, which has not been previously reported, is a remarkable new development in a mounting list of examples of censorship of pro-Palestinian speech.The Guardian spoke with four scholars who had written for the issue, and one of the journal’s editors. It also reviewed internal emails that capture how enthusiasm about a special issue intended to promote “scholarly conversation on education and Palestine amid repression, occupation, and genocide” was derailed by fears of legal liability and devolved into recriminations about censorship, integrity and what many scholars have come to refer to as the “Palestine exception” to academic freedom.If the universities are not willing to stand up for what is core to their mission, I don’t know what they’re doing. What’s the point?Thea Abu El-HajPaul Belsito, a spokesperson for the Harvard Graduate School of Education, wrote in a statement to the Guardian that the decision to cancel the special issue followed nine months of conversations and an “overall lack of internal alignment” about the issue.The authors see it differently. “If the universities – or in this case a university press – are not willing to stand up for what is core to their mission, I don’t know what they’re doing. What’s the point?” said Thea Abu El-Haj, a Palestinian-American anthropologist of education at Barnard College, the women’s school affiliated with Columbia University, who was one of the solicited authors.Harvard has been embroiled in a bitter battle with the Trump administration over millions in federal funding cuts and the revocation of its eligibility to host international students. In April, it became the first and so far only university tosue the administration, earning praise for its resistance to Trump’s onslaught.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators rally on Cambridge Common calling on Harvard leadership to resist federal government interference at the university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 12 April.Photograph: Nicholas Pfosi/ReutersBut Harvard has also cracked down on Palestine scholarship,demotings scholarsand cancelingrelatedprograms. “Harvard is being held up as the heroic institution, but what’s happening internally is much more complicated,” said Abu El-Haj.In January, as part of a legal settlement with Jewish students who had accused Harvard of tolerating and promoting antisemitism on campus, the universityadopted a controversial definitionthat critics argue conflates antisemitism with criticism of Israel.In an email to the authors announcing the cancellation, the executive director of the publishing group did not cite antisemitism; she wrote the decision stemmed from what she described as an inadequate review process and the need for “considerable copy editing”.The journal’s editorial board rejected that characterization and said they had been sidelined by the publisher in making the decision. The decision to cancel the issue was “out of alignment with the values that have guided HER for nearly a century”, the board members wrote in a collective statement.They staged protests for Palestine. The consequences have been life-changingRead moreThe announcement came after the publishers had demanded that the articles be submitted to a legal review late into the process – a step the authors found highly unusual and called a “dangerous form of institutional censorship” in a joint letter objecting to the demand. The publisher’s request was prompted by fear the issue would attract antisemitism claims, said one editor.The dispute underscores the unprecedented restraints placed on knowledge production amid escalating accusations of antisemitism on campuses and the Trump administration’s crusade against higher education. But it also signals the levels to which universities are abandoning their stated commitments out of fears of legal or financial repercussions.“Even within the broader landscape around Palestine in the university, it’s unprecedented,” saidChandni Desai, a professor at the University of Toronto and author of one of the scrapped articles. “You just don’t solicit work, peer-review it, have people sign contracts, advertise the articles, and then cancel not just one article, but an entire special issue.”Tensions boil overThe Harvard Educational Review is a century-old academic journal that publishes research and opinion geared to education academics and professionals and is considered a leading publication in the field. It is published by the Harvard Education Publishing Group, a division of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and edited by doctoral students at the university.The Palestine issue was slated to include a dozen research articles, essays and other writings on topics ranging from education in Israel-Palestine and among the Palestinian diaspora, to academic freedom in the US. They explored the evolution of the concept of “scholasticide”, a term describing the systematic annihilation of education first coined during Israel’s 2008 invasion of Gaza; the “ethical and educational responsibilities” of English language teachers in the West Bank; and the impact of “crackdowns on dissent” on teaching about Palestine in US higher education institutions, according to finalized abstracts of the articles shared with the Guardian.Abu El-Haj’s piece, co-authored with two other scholars, explored the “centrality of education in the struggle for Palestinian liberation”, drawing from an oral history project on the experiences of teachers with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. The journal’s editors were so enthusiastic about her piece that last spring they selected it with two others to promote the upcoming special issue on the back cover of the spring one.View image in fullscreenA copy of the Harvard Education Review previewing a future issue dedicated to education in and about Palestine.Photograph: Thea Abu El-HajThe special issue was also formally announced at an annual gathering of education scholars in Chicago in March. “There was quite a lot of interest in it,” said Jo Kelcey, a professor at the Lebanese American University in Beirut and one of Abu El-Haj’s co-authors.The authors received the first inkling of trouble shortly after that.Rabea Eghbariah, a Palestinian doctoral candidate at Harvard Law School, had been solicited to write the afterword for the special issue. In 2023, a different Harvard journal, the Harvard Law Review, had blocked publication of an article it had commissioned from him. When the Columbia Law Review published the piece instead, that journal’s board responded by temporarilyshutting downits entire website. Wary of that experience, Eghbariah specifically requested to amend his contract with the Harvard Educational Review to add a clause seeking to safeguard his academic freedom. After a long silence, the journal declined his request in April.“It is incredibly shameful to see a university publication so explicitly betraying its mission and rejecting a clause on protecting academic freedom,” said Eghbariah, who did not sign the contract. “My afterword specifically is about Nakba denialism – the phenomenon of manipulating facts to affirm Zionism and shape knowledge with regards to Palestine – and it is quite ironic that it is being denied publication.”View image in fullscreenPalestinian human rights lawyer Rabea Eghbariah.Photograph: Courtesy Rabea EghbariahDays after their response to Eghbariah, the journal’s editorial board wrote to the authors, citing an “increasingly challenging climate” and asking for their availability for a meeting, which never ended up happening. “As a part of a scholarly community deeply committed to uplifting Palestinian voices and scholarship, we are facing some increasingly unprecedented contexts,” they wrote.The email offered little detail, but for weeks, the journal’s editors had been under mounting pressure from the publisher. In January, they were told that an “institutional review” of the manuscripts would be required. In February, the publisher tried – without the editors’ knowledge – to alter the back cover of the spring issue promoting some of the forthcoming articles, according to email correspondence reviewed by the Guardian. (The printing company flagged the change to the editors, who reversed it.) In conversations with the editors – although not in writing – the publisher acknowledged that it was seeking a “risk assessment” legal review by Harvard’s counsel out of fear the issue’s publication would prompt antisemitism claims, an editor said.As tensions came to a head, the board again contacted the authors in early May, to inform them of the requested legal review.It was an extraordinary demand, the authors and editor interviewed by the Guardian said. Legal reviews would sometimes be requested for a specific article when there is a libel concern – but early in the process, and not for an entire issue, they noted.“This doesn’t happen, certainly not at the point where you’ve been accepted for publication and you’ve signed contracts,” said Kelcey. “This is not the way scholarship is supposed to operate.”By then, the Trump administration had upended higher education by threatening billions of dollars in funding from universities in the US over their responses to pro-Palestinian protests. Harvard had sued in April, escalating its feud with the president. The authors, who hadn’t initially been in touch, found each other and organised a collective response, slamming the request for a legal review at that stage as “unprecedented”, they wrote in a 15 May letter to the journal’s editorial board and publisher. “This sends a dangerous message to scholars globally: that academic publishing contracts are conditional, revocable, and subject to external political calculations.”View image in fullscreenStudents protesting against the war in Gaza, and passersby walking through Harvard Yard, at an encampment at Harvard University in Massachusetts, on 25 April 2024.Photograph: Ben Curtis/APThe authors asked for the legal review to be reconsidered. But less than a month later, the press’s executive director, Jessica Fiorillo, wrote to them that the issue was being pulled altogether. In an email seen by the Guardian, she claimed the manuscripts were “unready for publication”, in part due to a copy editor’s resignation. She also cited an unspecified “failure to adhere to an adequate review process”, a “lack of internal alignment” between the authors, editors and the publisher, and “the lack of a clear and expedient path forward to resolving the myriad issues at play”.Why are America’s elite universities so afraid of this scholar’s paper?Read more“This difficult situation is exacerbated by very significant lack of agreement about the path forward, including and especially whether to publish such a special issue at this time,” she wrote.The copy-editing issue wasn’t just a personnel one. The publisher’s letter claimed that the review editors “provided highly restrictive editing guidelines to the copy editor under contract to work on the special issue, limiting her focus to grammar, punctuation, and syntax errors, and directing her to refrain from offering any editorial suggestions to address, in the editors’ words, ‘politically charged’ content”. It claimed that the copy editor resigned in large part because of those restrictions.Fiorillo added that it would be “entirely appropriate” to subject the work to legal checks for “any libelous or unlawful material” but that no such review had taken place. She added that the cancellation was not “due to censorship of a particular viewpoint nor does it connect to matters of academic freedom”.A ‘deep loss’The journal’s editors were blindsided. “The Editorial Board has not been made privy to any internal decision-making at HEPG regarding the Special Issue, and we only learned about this communication and decision 30 minutes before it was sent out,” they wrote to the authors shortly after Fiorillo’s email.In a longer letter to the authors, two days later, they rebutted Fiorillo’s claims about irregularities in the review process and expressed disappointment with the decision to cancel the issue.“It is a deep loss that your work will not appear in the pages of [Harvard Educational Review] as we intended – for HER, for the field of education, and for social justice,” they wrote.Regarding the publisher’s claim regarding overly restrictive copy-editing guidelines, the editors said that they were asked by the publisher to develop copy-editing guidelines – something that hadn’t been required for previous issues – and that they invited feedback at multiple points in the process.It is not clear how far up within Harvard’s administration the decision to cancel the issue had come from. Belsito, the spokesperson for the Harvard Graduate School of Education, wrote that Harvard’s office of the general counsel does not “make or direct editorial decisions” for the school or its publishing group.“HEPG acknowledges the disappointment this decision may have caused for the authors and remains deeply committed to our robust editorial process, only publishing work of the highest scholarly quality through a process rooted in integrity, collaboration, and editorial rigor,” he added.To us, it sounded like a textbook example of the killing of speech and academic inquiry related to PalestineKirsten WeldThe Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors whichgot involved after learning about the cancellation, believes the decision came from the publisher.“To us, it sounded like a textbook example of the killing of speech and academic inquiry related to Palestine,” said Kirsten Weld, a history professor and the chapter’s president. “Thus far, though our fact-finding remains incomplete, it looks like the impetus came from Harvard Education Publishing Group.”One of the editors of the Harvard Educational Review, who asked for anonymity citing the repressive climate in academia, said that the pressure from the publisher on the editors ramped up shortly before Trump took office. The request to subject the entirety of the edited manuscripts to a risk assessment was “totally abnormal” the editor said. “I didn’t even know the [office of the general counsel] review was an option, I had never heard of it.”The censorship of the issue, the editor added, is “exactly how authoritarianism grows”.The members of the editorial board who worked on the issue said that they had done their best to “advance this work amidst a climate of repression and institutional accommodation”.“As we reflect on this moment, we urge the scholarly community to defend the ability to publish rigorous, justice-oriented scholarship without interference and repression,” they added.The ordeal was a “test case” for academic freedom, said Desai, whose article on scholasticide, co-written with three Palestinian colleagues, was also directly solicited and advertised on the back of the spring journal issue. (It was the teaser to their article that the publishers tried to remove from the back of the previous issue, without the editors’ knowledge.)Desai criticized the cancellation as a “serious breach and violation of academic freedom and integrity” but also an affront to the labor of scholars who are “writing these articles during a genocide”.View image in fullscreenThe heavily damaged building of Al-Azhar University in Gaza City, on 15 February 2024.Photograph: AFP via Getty ImagesShe and her co-authors, including a dean at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, were not merely documenting the resilience of Palestinian education amid the destruction but were personally involved inthose efforts, she noted. Many of their colleagues and students were killed as the group worked on the article. “This is not some abstract academic exercise,” said Desai. “I can’t keep stressing the urgency of this article as we’re watching universities being blown up.”The authors are in talks with other journals and hope their pieces can be published together as planned. All those interviewed by the Guardian expressed fear that the incident would deter other scholars from pursuing work on Palestine – a longstanding problem that they say has only been exacerbated over the last two years. “There’s this risk of kind of closing down the democratic space,” said Kelcey.The destruction of Palestine is breaking the world | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreAs Israel and Palestine have become the flashpoint for a rapidly deteriorating climate for free speech and academic freedom in the US, Harvard has already demoted two faculty members leading the Center for Middle Eastern Studies (one of whom wrote the forward for the cancelled issue), suspended a partnership with Birzeit University in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and ended a divinity school initiative dedicated to the conflict.Scholars fear that the the capitulation of universities is hurting an entire field of study at the time when it’s most needed. But Abu El-Haj warned that the special issue’s cancellation also set a dangerous precedent for the independence of scholarship on a variety of subjects. She accused the publisher of “anticipatory compliance” and warned that “it’s not going to stop with Palestine,” she said.But she also sounded a note of optimism. In a sign of the growing chasm between decision-makers and the broader public on the issue, she said that the war in Gaza had led to unprecedented interest among students in Palestine coursework and scholarship.She recalled being a student in the US during Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon and the massacres in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila by Israeli-backed Lebanese militias. “There were three of us protesting,” she recalled. “I never would have imagined in my life I’d see the encampments that happened last year.“We’re in a really critical juncture,” she added. “The level of repression that we’re seeing is related to the shift in the narrative, and the loss of control over that narrative.”Explore more on these topicsHarvard UniversityIsrael-Gaza warTrump administrationUS universitiesHigher educationUS politicsAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

But officials at the Unesco headquarters in Paris had been braced for a potential US departure during Trump’s second term. The US provides about 8% of the body’s total budget, making the financial impact of Washington’s departure less severe than for other organisations,such as the WHO, for which the US is by far the biggest financial backer.The White House deputy spokesperson Anna Kelly told the New York Post: “President Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from Unesco – which supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out of step with the commonsense policies that Americans voted for in November.”In February, the White House had announced a 90-day review of the US membership of Unesco, saying in a statement that the global body had “demonstrated failure to reform itself, has continually demonstrated anti-Israel sentiment over the past decade, and has failed to address concerns over mounting arrears”.Unesco, theUnited NationsEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, is best known for designating world heritage sites including the Grand Canyon in the US and the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria. It also has a large cultural and education programme to promote intercultural dialogue.The US was a founding member of Unesco in 1945, but this latest departure will be the third time it has quit.Washington first withdrew in 1983 under Ronald Reagan, whose administration said the global organisation had anti-western bias and “has extraneously politicised virtually every subject it deals with”. It rejoined under George W Bush in 2003, with the White House saying it was happy with Unesco reforms.Trumppulled the US out of Unescoin 2017, during his first term as president. His administration cited what it called “mounting arrears, the need for fundamental reform in the organisation, and continuing anti-Israel bias”.The USreturned to Unescoin 2023 under Joe Biden. The Biden administration said it was crucial to rejoin in order to counter “Chinese influence”. Beijing had become the organisation’s biggest financial backer in Washington’s absence. As a condition of readmission, the US agreed to pay about $619m in unpaid dues and make contributions to programmes supporting education access initiatives in Africa, Holocaust remembrance and journalists’ safety.In 2011, Unesco voted to admit Palestine, which is not formally recognised by the US or Israel as a UN member state. The Barack Obama White House had cut Unesco contributions, resulting in the US owing millions in arrears to the organisation.Audrey Azoulay, the director general of Unesco, said: “However regrettable, this announcement was anticipated and Unesco has prepared for it.”Azoulay said she “deeply” regretted Trump’s decision to leave, saying the move “contradicts the fundamental principles of multilateralism”.She said the reasons given by the US for leaving were the same as during Trump’s first term, and she disputed them. “These claims contradict the reality of Unesco’s efforts, particularly in the field of Holocaust education and the fight against antisemitism.”Azoulay said Unesco had undertaken structural reforms and diversified its funding sources, so “the decreasing trend in the financial contribution of the US has been offset”. Unesco was not considering cutting jobs due to the US departure, she added.Explore more on these topicsUnescoDonald TrumpUnited NationsTrump administrationParisUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Then, with hours to go, she had a medical emergency. The former dancer explains how it all fed into her new standup showTue 22 Jul 2025 09.58 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Jul 2025 12.17 EDTShare‘My first thought,” says Thanyia Moore, “was there has to be a show in this.” The comedian is talking about what happened when her debutEdinburgh festivalfringe show flipped from fun into misfortune. Standups often embrace personal tragedy, spinning it all into material – and that was certainly the case with Moore, three years ago. The former dancer from London had a 10-year buildup to her first fringe show – a deliberately light introduction to her world. She’d become known as a consummate MC, won the Funny Women award in 2018, and was breaking into TV as an actor and writer. Moore wasn’t even sure she wanted to do the fringe. “I’ve never been enticed or influenced,” she says, “by what people think you should do.” But then came an offer from Soho theatre’s production arm, and the chance to prove she could build an hour of standup from scratch persuaded her to head to Scotland.I threw myself into therapy: breath work, womb work, tea-drinking, tree-huggingCompared to other debutantes – who are generally battling crushing financial and career pressures – Moore felt relaxed. Her show’s run was paid for, she’d had time to finesse it, and she’d just got to grips with some huge personal news: she was pregnant. She decided to keep this to herself, but take it easy, turning down other gigs to focus on her solo show.The previews went well. She was excited. Then, showering before her first show, she saw blood. Moore recognised the signs: she had had a miscarriage before. What happened next is the subject of August, a show she begins performing in Edinburgh next week, which takes us through the Scottish NHS, her diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, and travelling to London for surgery before rushing back to the fringe to finish her run. It’s a show about coping, about powering on when the whole world wants you to stop.In August, Moore reflects on her tendency to push loved ones away and look for distractions in work and humour. She ignored concerned messages and filled her schedule with up to nine shows a day. There was, she says, an element of “running from friends and family who wanted to look after me. But I’m very spilt milk – there’s nothing I can do. The other option was to stay at home with people telling me to rest and asking if I’m OK. That’s not going to change the situation. Why not go to the place where nobody knows what’s happened and just be treated the same?”View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t have to think about anything sad’ … the comedian in Edinburgh.Photograph: Rebecca Need-MenearThe comedian’s instinct to think about her experience as a future show “gave me relief and lightness”. She passed off her brief disappearance as a groin injury sustained during a dance number in the show. And then there were all the distractions of Edinburgh during the festival. “From someone sunbathing half-naked in the middle of the meadows,” she recalls, “to grown men walking round in wizard outfits. That’s what I love the fringe for – I didn’t have to think about anything sad.Many weeks later, she started making an effort to confront her feelings. “I was throwing myself into different types of therapy: breath work, womb work, tea-drinking, tree-hugging. It wasn’t until the next year that I probably had my first cry.”She admits now that she was grieving. “I’d never been attached to becoming a parent,” she says. “That took ages to get my head around – and now I had to unpick it.” There was the physical side, too: “I also was like, ‘Why does my body not do the thing it’s supposed to do?’ I feel sad when I think, ‘Babes, you really went through it – and you just carried on. You need to be kinder to yourself.’ I won’t be, because this is who I am, but there are days where I’m like, ‘That’s heavy.’”Working on the show gave Moore space to process. After considering writing it as theatre, she returned to comedy as she had rarely seen this topic broached with humour. “I was obsessed with not making it a sad show,” she says. “My focus was to make sure the audience felt safe to laugh when I wanted them to laugh, feel when I wanted them to feel.” The result is funny, of course, yet surprisingly light. “I’m telling you the truth. And the truth is, ‘I don’t like being sad all the time.’”Does it feel contradictory to write about dwelling in sadness in a show that revisits her experience every day for a month? Moore hopes August shows that not everyone grieves in the same way, and that’s OK. At previews, audience members have shared stories, not just of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. “People have resonated with losing something and carrying on,” she says. “If your friend’s sad, then asking every day ‘Are you all right?’ is reminding them every day that they might not be. Just get through it, babes, and try not to stay there too long.”Thanyia Moore: August is atPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, 30 July to 24 August; andSoho theatre, London, 1 to 6 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsComedyEdinburgh festivalEdinburgh festival 2025PregnancyMiscarriageinterviewsShareReuse this content"

With drummerJudith SchwarzandArthur Fussyon modular synthesiser, he has formed an unorthodox trio to deliver a show in which each stroke, beat and jump lives up the title: Make It Count. It’s an hour of unusual rigour with an electrifying thrill – and the standout from my whirl through Vienna’sImPulsTanz festival, a kaleidoscopic programme of performance and participation.With the studied nonchalance of a rock star, Haitzmann stands on one of three island-like platforms, swinging what could be mistaken for a mic lead.Hanna Kritten Tangsoo’s lighting design will become increasingly mercurial but right now the synth desk twinkles, beams crisscross the stage creating an anarchic A next to the drum kit and the swirling rope resembles a red flash of lightning.The surface of Haitzmann’s stage becomes a drum skin and the rope’s handle a substitute stick to build rhythm, each thud ushering in a sound that suggests the crack of a glacier. The musicians, wearing similar mottled outfits, pick up each other’s prompts and the sound swells until you can’t always identify each instrument. That’s because Haitzmann is now jumping feverishly and will spend most of the performance skipping: the swish and squeak of his exercise interrupted with an occasional yelp to cue a switch in lighting.View image in fullscreenBrings everyone in the room in … Make It Count.Photograph: Alicja HoppelThis is an incredibly disciplined piece, more so than much gig theatre, and the tempo slows for an erotically charged sequence in which the rope steadily thwacks the floor against the sultry pulse of the accompaniment. Haitzmann may look like a boxer in training but the difference is this is not an individual endeavour – he wants to get in the zone but bring everyone else in the room with him.The intensity builds, punctured by Haitzmann’s occasional break for a snack or drink. A feat like this could easily come across as larky or po-faced but the design, music and movement are wholly integrated even in more delicately handled sequences, which retain an air of rehearsal experiments, where upturned cymbals are placed around the stage and struck with the rope. It all amounts to the most imaginative reframing of a music gigsince KlangHaus stormed the Edinburgh fringe in 2014.View image in fullscreen‘Performing is a high-wire act’ … Joe Alegado in Bits and Pieces.Photograph: Bobal PhotographyPart of ImPulsTanz’s young choreographers’ series, called[8:tension], Make It Count is a tightrope of a show, which chimes with an observation at the start of festival veteranJoe Alegado’s latest creation. “Performing is a high-wire act,” says Alegado. “An act of courage!” That’s the kind of circus-barker spiel that more typically introduces acrobatic spectacle but his new choreography, prefaced by softly spoken reflections and a meditative projected film, is triumphantly unshowy.Alegado has been teaching workshops at ImPulsTanz since it was co-founded, 41 years ago, by Karl Regensburger (who still presides over the festival) and the lateIsmael Ivo. Staged in a studio at Vienna’s Arsenal, a former military complex, under the unprepossessing title Bits and Pieces, Alegado’s offering captures what you could call the quality of sharing. On a barely lit stage, he begins with a graceful solo, the movement – especially the play of his fingers – often as wispy as his long grey hair. The piece ends with him pulling an imaginary thread; the next dancer arrives and resumes the motif.View image in fullscreenThe play of fingers and small gestures … Bits and Pieces.Photograph: Bobal PhotographyOne soloist inspires another soloist and they then join together in a duet; three individuals are in turn activated by another and led into a quartet. A playful sequence spotlights only the twisting hands of all four in a row (Alegado is joined by Blanka Flora Csasznyi, Simona Lazurová and Katarina Vinieskova), their black costumes concealing them in darkness. Throughout are gestures of giving and receiving, inspiring and developing, each move rounding out another’s idea to suggest the passing on of knowledge.In the Arsenal’s warren of studios, workshops are doing just that, at all levels, with public classes ranging from dancehall to Limón technique, watched by anyone who chooses to linger. (The festival’s Public Moves programme has a series of open-air stages across the city for people to take part, too.) Alegado’s array of pieces have a similar openness; the voiceover, though portentous, discusses the challenge of being fully present on stage and in achieving timelessness in your work. That is done through the most minimal of means here; a simple caress or a glance are not nothing, the pieces suggest – they can prove long-lasting. In these fragments, Alegado evokes a stillness, no matter how busy the movement or the accompaniment, which at one point consists of a cacophonous layered looping of breath work. When the 45 minutes are up, the parting gesture is of thread being wound up, ready for the next time.View image in fullscreenWhen does sharing trauma become narcissism? … Luigi Guerrieri in Poor Guy.Photograph: Lukas BeckBits and Pieces could just as easily provide an alternative title for the [8:tension] show Poor Guy, performed at the Schauspielhaus byLuigi Guerrieri, not least because he is fully naked throughout, save for jewellery from both the “Gypsy and non-Gypsy” sides of his family. Guerrieri explores how and when the sharing of personal trauma tips into narcissism or is met with kudos – whether it’s done on or off stage (and perhaps especially online, where the work originated). “I’m tired of myself,” he says, stretching out several octaves in that final word with look-at-me glee.In these vignettes, the distinction between memoir and sketch can be unclear: was little Luigi really delivered by a firefighter, and made the fire department’s mascot? Amid the occasional dead-end routine, it’s certainly moving and very funny; Guerrieri has a sophisticated understanding of how humour can not just temper but elucidate the pain in his story. There is also some innovative vocal delivery from our wildly charismatic host despite a viral infection that has limited his range tonight.View image in fullscreenResponding to Madonna’s call to arms … Lenio Kaklea.Photograph: Marikel LahanaHe begins by massaging his nipples, as if milking his story for all it is worth. A family history of violence and instability emerges but he upends expectations of autobiographies, particularly “misery memoirs”, and unsettles the transaction between performer and audience, roaming the crowd and flattering us individually to seek our approval. If we pity Guerrieri, the show asks, does it empower him or us?Against the same exposed brickwork of this stage, Greek choreographerLenio Kakleastarts her double bill with Alegado-esque projections of dancing hands, fluttering like shadow puppet birds in her film An Alphabet for the Camera. Kaklea frames parts of her body using her fingers as a substitute viewfinder, before widening the lens to show her performing as a tiny figure lost in vast landscapes both natural and industrial (her silver coat merging into the greyscale of a warehouse). In such an environment, how do you express yourself?Kaklea uses Madonna’s 80s hit of that name in the second piece, Untitled (Figures), performed on stage after an audio recording of Lesbian Nation author Jill Johnston. Kaklea has tremendous presence and first appears in bra and fishnets, responding to Madonna’s call to arms with finger clicks, smooth hips, coy glances, disco rolls and salsa shimmies before she struts down a chalked-out catwalk. But when the song is done, she deflates in a daze of confusion. It triggers a bid to express what she’s got – but on her own terms. Off come the bra and tights, on go side-buttoned jeans, boots and western hat but the techno score eventually leaves her on her back as if thrown from a horse.Changing into a pale pink leotard, she shifts through a series of seated poses, maximising eye contact with the audience. A balletic sequence is then given a rodeo-rider swagger; her dissatisfaction returns, her poses now like a doll contorted into awkward positions. Next comes a nautical costume – a nod, perhaps, to another of her queer idols, the artistYannis Tsarouchis. The show loses focus with her beguiling transformation as a lounge lizard, prowling around the audience with her tongue darting, but you’re left with the sense of a series of portraits in which Kaklea has searched for her own reflection.View image in fullscreenInspired by Strasbourg’s ‘dance epidemic’ of 1518 … Delirious Night.Photograph: Bea BorgersIn contrast to Guerrieri and Kaklea’s introspective solo pieces is the frenetic ensemble of Delirious Night, choreographed byMette Ingvartsen, at the Akademietheater. It takes inspiration from the “dance epidemic” recorded in Strasbourg over several weeks in 1518, when people were gripped by a mania to keep dancing – some of them right until death. The hysteria is captured in a banner on stage: “Attitudes Passionelles.” But the febrile atmosphere that Ingvartsen captures is of our own Covid era: that strange combination of collective unity and fear, dissociation and division, the rumble of protest and the potential to rebuild. The stage fills with bodies seeking connection, the mood somewhere between campfire shindig and unruly protest. “How can I resist? I want to resist,” runs one refrain.The dancers wear masks – Halloween ones, wrestling ones, beastly ones akin to Chewbacca – and many of them are topless, beating out rhythms on their bodies. There is no ringleader here, the paths pursued are freestyle and only occasionally do some of the nine performers fall into step. Ingvartsen captures that feeling of being out late, passing revellers, unsure whether they’ll prove to be jubilant or malevolent.Drummer Will Guthrie drives the piece with his own feverish score, the movement becoming more jagged and incantatory, and some of the dancers seem to visibly age as they wearily group together and question how they can go on. You begin to feel the same as the vibe reaches an end-of-the-night directionless state, the hangover seemingly arriving even before sleep. Ingvartsen set out to record “what living in times of crisis does to our bodies” and the result is both adrenalised and bleak, if never as precisely delivered as Make It Count.Ingvartsen’s dancers are seeking a release, a transformative state, like Haitzmann jumping rope. Or, in less extreme ways, like so many taking part in the open air classes around town at a festival that favours night owls with its 11pm show times and after-hours parties. Crossing the Danube late one evening, I spy a makeshift stage full of couples swaying right by the water. Here is a city that never sleeps – because it just keeps dancing.ImPulsTanz: Vienna international dance festivalruns until 10 August.

Try Sex and the City: The Movie insteadEvery attempt to recapture the original show’s panache has faced mixed-to-disastrous results. But the 2008 film follow-up deserves reappraisalCourtney ThompsonTue 22 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Jul 2025 20.11 EDTShareIt’s a rite of passage. Some stole late-night glimpses when they snuck into the lounge room while their mother watched it. Others gobbled it up on a laptop in bed.For gen Z, many first encountered Sex and the City via meme pages dedicated to digitally archiving the best outfits, best quotes or most problematic storylines from the HBO series that followed the misadventures of Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Samantha (Kim Cattrall), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and Charlotte (Kristin Davis). Then, when the series landed internationally on Netflix last year, gen Z got properly acquainted – and much to the surprise of their millennial elders, they didn’t hate it.The original show remains timeless. And rather than suffer through the increasingly deranged overtures of its revivalAnd Just Like That, newer fans may do well to revisit an earlier sequel – Sex and the City: The Movie.Released in 2008, it aligned perfectly with a cinema boom for millennial women, where moviegoing was done in groups, usually supplemented by themed drinks and food. It was also panned viciously by critics, who called it shallow and bloated – though thisSex and the Citydiehard thinks it deserves a reappraisal.It picks up where the series finale left off, providing a very neat synopsis of the intervening years. Carrie is still dating her on-again, off-again beau, Big. Charlotte and her husband Harry have adopted their daughter Lily. Samantha has moved to LA to manage her movie star boyfriend Smith’s career. And Miranda has moved to – quelle horreur – Brooklyn.View image in fullscreen‘A near-wedding, a breakup, a pregnancy, a tragically horny dog, some questionable product placement, a trip to Mexico that leads to a faecal incident, and then an actual wedding’ … the film in a nutshell.Photograph: Warner Bros Pictures/Cinetext/New Line Cinema/AllstarGranted, there are a lot of things wrong with this film. Like its 142-minute run time, which is at least 90 minutes too long. Or its farcical series of events: a near-wedding, a breakup, a pregnancy, a tragically horny dog, some questionable product placement, a trip to Mexico that leads to a faecal incident, and then an actual wedding. Or that every character’s life seems to revolve around Carrie in a far more egregious way than the series. Or that they fat-shame Samantha for putting on a couple of kilos. If the series was barely concealed lifestyle porn for millennial women, the movie makes no attempt at justifying the absurdity of these people’s lives. The clothes are even flashier, the real estate is more lavish, and their personal problems are always solved by money.But beneath the excess, Sex and the City: The Movie works when it zeroes in on the ways that its central quartet continually show up for each other. Samantha feeds Carrie yoghurt after she hasn’t left her bed for two days. Miranda opens her door on New Year’s Eve to a breathless Carrie, who’s run across the city to get there before midnight to tell her, “You’re not alone.” When Charlotte runs into the man who’s betrayed her friend, her face cracks open in feral rage. “I curse the day you were born!” she screams. The movie, like the show, only makes sense when it’s exploring the inexplicable bonds among these four women and what it means to be a true friend.View image in fullscreen‘Almost feels improvised’: the naturalism of the film’s depiction of female friendship.Photograph: New Line Cinema/Sportsphoto/AllstarOne of the most emotionally brutal scenes in the movie is when Miranda and Carrie go out for dinner on Valentine’s Day – sans suitors. Carrie is heartbroken; Miranda has a guilty secret to confess. When it all spills over into a fight in the middle of the restaurant, it feels genuinely tragic: a failure of communication so familiar it stings. It’s one of the most believable moments in the movie; Parker and Nixon capture the agony of friendship so naturally it almost feels improvised.Crucially, the film can stand on its own. You don’t need to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of Carrie’s past boyfriends. You don’t need to know that Samantha once dated a lesbian artist, or that Charlotte and Harry met because of her divorce, or that Miranda once yelled at a man, “I’m no Mena Suvari but I’m great in bed!” You can get through Sex and the City: The Movie without knowing what any of those things mean and still understand what this movie is about: four women who help each other as they constantly renegotiate their relationships with men. It’s a perfect paean to imperfect friendships.Sex and the City: The Movie is available to stream on Binge and Prime Video in Australia, Netflix in the UK and HBO Max in the US.

Instead, in this small-time British crime drama, James Nelson-Joyce and Kyle Rowe play old mates dealing drugs in the fictional northern town where they grew up. It’s a brawling tale about a man who feels trapped by toxic masculinity, though in the end the film too backs itself into a bit of a dead end of macho violence.Nelson-Joyce is Wes, who has been questioning his life and choices since his best mate Tommy (Rowe) went to prison. Wes and his girlfriend Zoe (Olivia Frances Brown) have just had a baby, and there’s even talk of a job. Then Tommy is released, a repugnant bully unwilling to let Wes go. Rowe’s ferocious performance feels horribly real, like an angry dysregulated little boy with a need to break anything he can’t have. Tommy’s rage gives the film some nauseating moments; perhaps even harder to stomach is the casual misogyny in Wes’s circle. Reputation is a grim portrait of male rage, though it doesn’t seem particularly interested in the reasons behind it.There is a real sense of place though, in rows of narrow terraced houses backing on to wide open expanses of countryside. And for a film put together on what looks like a minuscule budget, it gets a considerable amount done. There’s a promising plotline about one of Wes and Tommy’s customers, the mother of a murdered 10-year-old boy, as well as little flickers here and there of another life open to Wes. But in the end it all builds to a big grandiose violent ending, which is a bit of a shame.● Reputation is on digital platforms from 28 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsMenreviewsShareReuse this content"

The pop culture off-worlders these beasties most resemble physically, however, are the xenomorphs from James Cameron’s Aliens – and not the massive multi-limbed queen, mind you, but the smaller foot-soldier guys who can be played by a fella in a suit.This fella-in-a-suit aspect is the one of the film’s strengths. You might argue that it hinders the willing suspension of disbelief, because you always know you’re looking at a fella in a suit. But in truth there’s something about the physicality of even the hokiest practical effect that is more enjoyable than all but the most skilfully rendered digital efforts.Another area in which the film recalls the earlier work of James Cameron is in the casting of Linda Hamilton (Terminator 2: Judgment Day) in the role of a tough, uncompromising military type. Lest fans get too excited by the Hamilton-heavy marketing for the film, she certainly gives good Hamilton while on screen, but she doesn’t appear for the first hour; it’s very much an “and Linda Hamilton” credits situation. And that’s fine: it’s better to have practical effects and a modest helping of recognisable actors than A-listers sleepwalking through expensive CGI glop for a paycheck.

In life, he was almost preternaturally prolific.He started late– his debut, The Hoop, didn’t appear until he was in his early 30s – but with that first poetry collection a dam was breached; over the next three and a half decades, he published at the rate of nearly a book a year.His output was eclectic: 17 collections were interspersed with novels (notable among them the ravishingA Summer of Drowning, set in far-north Norway under a luminescent midnight sun) and a trio of bleached and harrowing memoirs that laid bare the catastrophe and disintegration of his early life. But he was a poet first and foremost, a poet in his heart. To read his poetry is to feel, just for a moment, as if the world’s edges have been pushed back; as if, by standing beside him, you too can see further and more clearly. The shock of his final collection isn’t that it exists; it’s no surprise at all to hear him from beyond the grave. Rather, it’s the realisation that, after the astonishing generosity of these last decades, what we have in our hands really are his final words.It’s our great good fortune, then, that Burnside’s closing work is also one of his finest. The poems are few in number – just 19 – but there’s no impression, often present in posthumous collections, of a structure hastily assembled out of ill-fitting parts. In fact, The Empire of Forgetting is marked both by its coherence – thematic, imagistic and linguistic – and a sense of its fitness. These are poems that deal directly and almost exclusively with mortality.This isn’t, of course, new territory for Burnside: his poetry has always been death-haunted, peopled with ghosts. But here the focus has shifted, from the general (loss, religion, afterlife, decay) to the specific. The whole collection is an anticipation of, a grappling with, his own death: “the darkness-to-come”.In a handful of the poems, he appears to meet the matter head-on. Last Days, with its mentions of “hospice” and funereal “white chrysanthemums”, offers a vision of “starlight at the far end of the ward / where time has stopped, the way it sometimes stops / in theatres, when the actors leave the stage”. A little further on, in As If from the End Times, he picks up the word “last” (which sounds like a bell throughout the collection) and weaves it through the poem, most plangently in the elegiac central stanza, which describes “Last day of birdsong; salt rain in the trees; / the echo of someone going about / their business, making good or making hay / – you never know for sure, although you know / that something here is coming to an end”. But for the most part, his impending mortality is considered more obliquely, through the twin lenses, familiar to Burnside-watchers, of nature (damaged, depleted, but still sublime) and memory.It is memory – and its shadow, forgetting – to which Burnside keeps circling back in this collection, the space that it takes up here offering a clear and poignant mirror of the space it takes up in our lives as we move past middle age. His mother and father, both frequent presences in his work, take the stage again: the former a locus of endless longing; the latter a baleful “trail / of Players No 6 and coal-tar soap”.Burnside imagines his way into death, and in doing so, comes close to writing an epitaph for himselfBurnside’s writing, particularly in his memoirs, is dominated by his father’s bitter legacy, but as he himself draws nearer to the end, it is his mother to whom he turns. In the heart-catching title poem, he leans into poetry’s ability to efface time, locating the pair of them in a soft-lit, sweet-scented version of his childhood. “What if my mother walked home in the grey of morning, one last day”, he writes, going on to imagine a reunion that is almost epiphanic, a “momentary // halcyon of everyone / together, voices, singsong in the dark”. To Burnside the afterlife isn’t a voyaging out, but a voyaging in: a route back into the lost past.And this past, when he conjures it, is marked by its externality: it’s not the houses and furniture of memory that he craves, but the seasons, the “evening dusk”, the “quince, or damson, strafed into the grass”, “the field where, once, / we played Dead Man’s Fall”. The purity and clarity of nature in the past is counterpointed by the present: “a ruined / thicket, sump oil / rotting in the grass, a spill / of Roundup in a rut of mud and dock”.This is the Burnside we know: attentive to the degradation of nature; staring it in the face and obliging us to stare at it, too. But in his final collection, more often than not, it’s the beauty that possesses him. These are poems filled with songbirds, orchards, “birch woods”, litanies of flowers (“foxgloves, purple / loosestrife, sprawls / of clematis”). The weather is beneficent: sunlight filters, snow drifts and blankets, frost “performs its secret ministry”, there’s the sound of “small rain in the leaves”. The world we see here, through the eyes of a poet at the end of his life, is almost unbearably beautiful – which makes the leave-taking unbearable too.At the heart of the collection is The Memory Wheel, in which Burnside imagines his way into death, and in doing so comes close to writing an epitaph for himself. The poem concludes on the image of a memory: of “those mornings / when we shivered from our beds / and lit a fire / to magnify the dark”. If Burnside’s poetry – all his writing, but his poetry most powerfully of all – can be summed up, it might be like this: a bright light, an illumination that, in its beauty, reveals the depth of the darkness that surrounds us.It’s impossible not to love the world more when reading Burnside, and impossible not to be more scared and saddened while doing so. He was the ideal laureate of our age, painfully alive to the glory of what we’re losing. Now we’ve lost him, our Anthropocene spirit guide.

But he dislikes its hysterical leftwing critics too – arguably with more vehemence. He takes great pride in having no truck with tribes, but he does belong to one: like halitosis, as Terry Eagleton quipped, ideology appears to be only what the other person has. Williams may think he is a freethinker above the fray, but he has a creed – and it is liberal complacency.His 2010 debut memoir Losing My Cool was the story of – as the subtitle had it – Love, Literature and a Black Man’s Escape from the Crowd. Rap, he declared, was not so much a genre as a subculture, seducing young black men into a world of crime. That, apparently, would have been Williams’s fate (when he physically attacks his girlfriend, for instance, hip-hop lyrics shoulder the blame) had it not been for Pappy, his disciplinarian father, who foisted 15,000 books on him.The classics beat crime in the end, and we leave Williams on his happy road to intellectualdom, absorbing Sartre in Parisian cafes. But it wasn’t enough for him to merely present his own story; Williams elected to hold up his life as an example for black Americans. “See, you can be just like me” is the breathless gist of Losing My Cool. It never struck him that he might have had certain class advantages – a father with a PhD in sociology; a mixed-race heritage; an upbringing in white, bourgeois, suburban New Jersey – that make him somewhat unrepresentative as a role model.Self-Portrait in Black and White: UnlearningRace, Williams’s second memoir, published just before the pandemic, served up more hyper-agentic advice. The springboard for these post-racial reflections was the birth of his daughter. Bearing, as babies tend to do, a resemblance to her mother, who is white and French, Williams’s child is blond. It follows that there is an arbitrariness to the whole business of race, from which Williams swiftly emancipates himself. Then comes the counsel: black Americans would do well to follow in his footsteps by “transcending” race themselves. Conceding that this may be an easier proposition for him and his white-passing daughter, he exhorts mixed-race people to “form an avant garde when it comes to rejecting race”.Williams’s grand subject being himself, now we have a third memoir. Summer of Our Discontent takes a caustic look at Black Lives Matter from the lofty vantage point of his Parisian garret. At the outset, he tells us that the self-preening, race-mad identity politics of left-leaning liberals has fostered atomisation and precluded solidarity. As a consequence, the illiberal, unhinged right, now united behind Trump, has stolen a march on them. But from this not unreasonable edifice, Williams throws up a enormous scaffolding of enemies, which comes to encompass anyone and everyone engaging in some form or another of collective action. Ultimately, by the end, it appears that Williams’s beef is not so much with Trump as with his leftwing critics.This is a strange, muddled book. On the one hand, Williams emphasises the primacy of class over race in the US.George Floyd, he says, was not your average African American: he was poor, unemployed, and had a criminal record. Horrific as his killing by a white policeman was, it was unduly racialised by BLM. Fewer than 25 unarmed black civilians are killed by police annually. Most black people will never find themselves in Floyd’s shoes, Williams contends.While class is important for Williams, class politics isn’t. There is only so much that initiatives to lift the poor from poverty can achieve, we are told, because “the fundamental political unit, going back to Aristotle, remains the family”. The left has got it all wrong, obsessing over the “macro level” when real change apparently happens at the individual level.Williams’s strategy is to cherrypick the most ludicrous examples of “Trump Derangement Syndrome” to smear the entire left. Sympathy from a few celebrities for the actor Jussie Smollett – who was accused of faking a hate-crime against himself, which he denied – is taken as evidence of the left’s crumbling “moral authority and credibility”. BLM, he claims, was driven by “an ascendant raider class” of middle-class and not always black activists seizing institutional power – such as when a “multi-ethnic mob of junior employees”ousted New York Times opinion editor James Bennetfor publishing Senator Tom Cotton’s call to deploy troops against BLM protests.Williams’s other objections appear to be mostly aesthetic. He expends much energy pillorying the performative activism of such BLM “allies” as “the official Twitter account of the wildly popular British children’s cartoon Peppa Pig”, which tweeted a black square in solidarity. Later, visiting BLM-ravaged Portland, he mourns that “a beloved statue of an elk has been toppled”. This in a town with a “well-deserved reputation” for “exquisite gastronomy”.Quelle horreur.He concludes by suggesting that the left and right are just as odious as one another. The storming of the Capitol in 2021, he says, had a mimetic quality, the populist right “aping” the “flamboyant reflex” of the unruly left. With such invidious comparisons, and with such a dim view of collective action, Williams is unable to make the case as to how precisely his homeland is to move towards a post-racial utopia. Excelling in sending up bien-pensant opinion, he has no answers. Fixated on slagging off the left, he has marooned himself on an island of vacuity. So when he articulates a positive vision of the future, all he offers are new age nostrums such as “reinvestment in lived community” and “truth, excellence, plain-old unqualified justice”.His plea for perspective is similarly misplaced. Young black Americans, Williams whinges, have been seduced by the race pessimism of the likes ofTa-Nehisi Coates, his more popular nemesis. He enjoins us to look on the bright side: the racial wage gap is closing; black school attainment rates are nearing white levels.Williams’s Panglossian outlook is, I suspect, a form of American parochialism. His homeland, he says, is a “society that is frankly more democratic, multi-ethnic, and egalitarian than any other in recorded history”. The Gini coefficient and Democracy Index beg to differ. There are eminently sensible reasons for race pessimism in America. Segregation and ghettoisation are facts of life. The wage gap between black and white people is still a staggering 21% (in Britain, it’s under 6%). White Americans live three-and-a-half years longer than black Americans on average (black Britons outlive white Britons).Collectively, it was not the complacent optimists (who declared we had never had it so good) but rather the do-gooding pessimists (that demanded change at the dreaded “macro level”) who overthrew slavery and fought for civil rights. Individually, too, pessimism pays. For someone who sets great store by personal agency, Williams will no doubt appreciate Billy Wilder’s melancholy observation – occasioned by losing three relatives at Auschwitz – that “the optimists died in the gas chambers; the pessimists have pools in Beverly Hills”.Summer of Our Discontent: The Age of Certainty and the Demise of Discourse by Thomas Chatterton Williams is published by Constable (£25).

Macbeth becomes a cutthroat netball musical at Edinburgh fringeLady Macbeth Played Wing Defence combines comedy, songs and athleticism as a young netball player reckons with her own ambitions against an electro-pop scoreArifa AkbarTue 22 Jul 2025 04.47 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Jul 2025 04.49 EDTShareAspate of Macbeths will hit the Edinburgh festival this month, all of which bring a novel spin on Shakespeare’s Scottish play. There’sMacbeth: The Musical, accompanied by pop classics, andMacbeth for Bairns, a sensory children’s version with bubbles. But the most leftfield must be an award-winning show that has taken the Australian fringe circuit by storm.As mashups go, Lady Macbeth Played Wing Defence is nothing if not high-wire. It’s a black comedy musical, which takes place on a netball court and features a seven-strong team of teen players, one of whom, Mac Beth, is a latter-day Lady M with vaulting ambitions of becoming Year 12 netball champion. The witches are a girl band called the Dagger Divas who goad her towards her goal, by any means necessary.Created and performed by an all-female creative team, Crash Theatre Co’s production debuted at Perth fringe festival in 2024 and arrives in Scotland as part of the House of Oz season. It has been compared to both Six the Musical, which started out at the Edinburgh fringe, and the Australian musicalFangirls, which had its London premierelast year. Its writer, Courtney McManus, who is also co-lyricist and performs the role of the team’s coach, works as an English teacher at an Australian school. She had noticed a lack of interest in Shakespeare among students and set out to encourage teenagers to connect with the tragedy.View image in fullscreen‘How do I make Shakespeare accessible?’ … Lady Macbeth Played Wing Defence.Photograph: Declan Young“In the English departments I’ve worked in, these texts are the ones on the shelves that have dust on them … If I said to my students ‘Who’s Shakespeare?’ they probably wouldn’t be able to tell you because it’s just not that relevant to them. That was key in my thinking: ‘how do I make Shakespeare accessible and relevant?’”Macbeth has always been her favourite Shakespeare play but her family has more of a passion for sport. “So for me it was about ‘how can I get people invested in Shakespeare?’” As soon as she had the idea to set it in the world of netball, she knew it had to be a musical, with bass, synths and athleticism combined. Bec Price composed its electro-pop score and co-wrote the lyrics (she directs the show, too) with influences from Lady Gaga, Kylie Minogue and Charli xcx – but with added sporting elements. Price sampled the sound of netball trainers on a court for one of the show’s main songs,Pick Your Player.“Synths are my favourite instruments in the whole world because they’re so layered,” says Price. “So when the girls came to me to write the music I thought ‘I’m going to make it a dance album’ and that’s exactly what they wanted … The vibe was that we wanted to make Shakespeare really cool and in the club … flashing lights and fast music with girls spinning around.”The play’s themes transposed perfectly to the adrenaline-fuelled world of competitive netball, thinks McManus, and served as a way to explore young female ambition, rivalry and teamwork. “The way the characters have been written by me mirror my experiences with young people when they’re having their worst moments and when they’re having their best, too.” Importantly, Mac Beth is given a redemption arc, explains McManus: “Mac Beth still feels the guilt, she still suffers the consequences of her actions, but she has a road to redemption.”Edinburgh festival 2025: 20 theatre shows to see this summerRead moreThe core message of the show revolves around the collective power of the team and the girls, rather than the individual power that Mac Beth craves. “We can take that message into the groups of women that surround us: we don’t need to be the biggest and the best. We just need to be supportive and supported.”Price has worked as a youth mentor, running camps for young girls’ mental health. “I was really passionate about the word ‘bossy’ which is never used to describe a man. So what is being bossy? What is being ambitious? Let’s put it on a stage and have everything go wrong but still at the end this girl deserves love, and to be part of the team.”Lady Macbeth Played Wing Defence is atAssembly George Square Studios, Edinburgh, 30 July to 25 August.

He filled the room with scores by Bartók, Brahms, Copland and Rachmaninoff; manuscripts in the hand of Bernstein and Rodgers and Hammerstein. “The last thing I brought him out was the manuscript for Gershwin’sPorgy and Bess,” Horowitz recalls. “That’s when he started to cry.”The “show and tell” of Sondheim’s favourite composers, mentors and collaborators at theLibrary of Congressin Washington DC in 1993 planted a seed. It convinced him, Horowitz believes, that his papers would be in good company at the world’s biggest library. “Shortly after that he said he was going to be changing his will and he in fact did. He sent me a printout of the paragraph in his will that left his manuscripts and things to the library.”Sondheimdied in 2021at the age of 91 and his bequest is now fulfilled.The library has acquiredabout 5,000 items including manuscripts, music and lyric drafts, recordings, notebooks and scrapbooks that provide an unrivalled window to the mind of the man some called the Shakespeare of musical theatre.‘We’re not here to slander Sondheim!’ Inside the master’s wild final musical, completed at lastRead moreAmong them are hundreds of music and lyric sketches of Sondheim’s well-known works as well as drafts of songs that were cut from shows or never made it to a production’s first rehearsal. Dozens of scrapbooks hold theatre programmes, clippings and opening night telegrams.On a Tuesday afternoon, the Guardian is ushered into the library’s inner sanctum for another Horowitz “show and tell”. The senior music specialist has laid several cardboard boxes on a table, opening them to reveal sheet music and other papers graced by Sondheim’s pencil.View image in fullscreenBarack Obama presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Stephen Sondheim in 2015.Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images“I love his hand, which I think is just gorgeous,” observes Horowitz, a longtime admirer and acquaintance of the winner of eight Tony awards, including a special Tony for lifetime achievement. “This intimacy with the process is a privilege and a great pleasure.”Sitting prominently are weathered spiral notebooks documenting some of Sondheim’s musical efforts while a student at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. There are music exercises, tunes and early compositions like the sheet music from his college musical, Phinney’s Rainbow, along with a programme from his high school musical, By George, written when he was 15.The crown jewels are manuscripts for some of Sondheim’s most celebrated shows including Company, Follies,Sweeney Toddand Into the Woods, as well as lesser-known works such as his plays and screenplays.Horowitz flicks through a thick folder containing40 pages of lyric sketchesfor A Little Priest, a duet where Sweeney, the demon barber of Fleet Street, and Mrs Lovett gleefully plan to dispose of his murder victims by baking their flesh into pies to sell at Mrs Lovett’s failing pie shop. It uses clever wordplay and puns about professions and social classes, imagining how 31 different flavours would suit various pies.Here is a master wordsmith at work. “One of the things he writes in the margins is lists of people who might be baked into the pies: cook, butler, page, sailor, tailor, actor, barber, driver, crier, gigolo. I went through the pages and counted them and I came up with 158 different professions that he considered as types of people.”Horowitz points to an abandoned idea: “Somewhere on this page is rabbi and the thing I get a kick out of is that then, a few pages later, he actually turns it into a couplet: ‘Everybody shaves except rabbis and riff-raff.’”Horowitz reaches into a box and produces lyric sketches forSend in the Clownsfrom A Little Night Music, along with a one-page inner monologue written as subtext for the character Desirée when she sings it. The most popular song that Sondheim ever wrote was also one of the quickest to turn around.Horowitz explains: “Basically in 24 hours he wrote his hit song whereas for most of his songs it took about two weeks, certainly for the longer numbers. There are 40 pages of sketches for Priest; I think there are nine pages here for Send in the Clowns.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Shawn Miller / Library of Congress“One of the reasons was they’d already been in rehearsal so he knew almost everything about the show and particularly aboutGlynis Johnsand her voice. He always described it as a light, silvery voice, which was very pleasant but she couldn’t sustain notes.“He wrote it specifically for her voice. It’s very short phrases, which is why they’re questions. ‘Isn’t it rich? Are we a pair?’ They cut off quickly. It was written for this character, for this place in the show, for this actress, for this voice, and knowing all that made it much easier than it would be otherwise.”The volume of work for each show seemed to increase, from three sheet music boxes for Company to nine forSunday in the Park with Georgeand 12 for Into the Woods. “I don’t know if it was because things got harder for him or he was more hard on himself,” Horowitz observes.“There’s no question that he was literally a genius but seeing the vast amount of perspiration in addition to the inspiration – it’s one thing to be witty and clever but to see how much went into refining and making everything as perfect and specific as possible is sort of staggering.”The collection also contains materials related to Sondheim’s plays and screenplays, such as draft scripts forThe Last of Sheila, and a commercial he wrote for The Simpsons when he was a guest on the show. Three boxes of specialty songs include birthday songs he wrote for friends Leonard Bernstein, Hal Prince and others.There are drafts of variations on the lyrics toI’m Still Herefrom Follies that Sondheim wrote for the singer and actor Barbra Streisand at her request. Horowitz rummages through a folder to find a 1993 fax from Streisand listing personal traits she wanted included such as “my name – shorten it”, “nails – too long”, “perfectionist”, “opinionated – big mouth”, “feminist”, “liberal”, “don’t want to perform live”. He comments: “She’s being fairly candid here about the things that people criticise her for and suggesting he include them in what he writes.”Sondheim primarily worked with pencil and paper for his music and lyric writing, even though he was “very computer proficient” and at one point considered writing video games. He made his first donation to the library in 1995: a vast record collection of about 13,000 albums accompanied by a hand-typed card catalogue. He also sat fora series of interviewswith Horowitz in 1997.View image in fullscreenI’m Still Here collage (for Streisand).Photograph: Elaina Finkelstein/Elaina Finkelstein / Library of CongressTo Horowitz, who produced a 70th birthday celebration concert for Sondheim in 2000, he was the artist who made him believe that musical theatre was “something important and something worthy of a life’s study and a life’s pursuit”. He was always intimidated by Sondheim in person but found him to be unfailingly kind and generous.He has fond memories of working on a production ofMerrily We Roll Alongat Arena Stage in Washington DC in 1990. Sondheim borrowed Horowitz’s rhyming dictionary as he was writing new lyrics for some of the songs. “When he handed it back to me, he said, ‘Just so you know, I put in some missing words,’ which he had in fact done.”Recalling another incident from that production, he says: “They had just done a run through with the orchestra and he was talking in the house to the producer, who was a very intimidating fellow I did not particularly like, and one of the musicians came up and was standing by the side, waiting very patiently, but this producer whipped around and said: ‘Yes, what do you want?’“The guy said: ‘I’m sorry, I was just wondering if there’s going to be another run through without the orchestra so I can sit and see the show?’ The producer was very dismissive and said: ‘I don’t know, we’ll see.’ Sondheim whipped around and said, ‘How dare you? Do you know how lucky you are that you have a musician who cares and wants to see the show?’ This guy withered a bit and it was very gratifying to me.”Horowitz credits Sondheim with changing the perception of musical theatre in academia. Previously “looked down upon by music departments and theatre departments”, Sondheim’s work has led to “an explosion of scholarship in musical theatre” because it “is that important and that good and that serious”.The Library of Congress aims to be a one-stop shop for researchers. The Sondheim collection joins existing archives of collaborators and mentors such as Leonard Bernstein, Oscar Hammerstein II and Richard Rodgers. Sondheim encouraged Hal Prince and Arthur Laurents to donate their collections to the library. TheJonathan Larsoncollection includes notes from Sondheim’s feedback.Yet the precious Sondheim collection was nearly lost. In 1995,there was a firein his home office at 246 East 49th Street in New York, where the manuscripts were kept in cardboard boxes on wooden shelves.Horowitz recalls: “When I went back afterwards, if you lifted the manuscripts out of the boxes, there were singe marks outlining where the paper sat in the boxes. Even now, as we’re going through the collection, we’re finding smoke damage on the edges of manuscript. Why they didn’t go up in flames, I don’t know. It truly is the closest I’ve ever seen in my life to a miracle.”Explore more on these topicsStephen SondheimUS theaterMusicalsTheatreLibrariesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is this necessarily a bad thing?Lucy KnightTue 22 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTSharePeople have always used books to assert their sophistication and affluence. You need only visit the library of a National Trust property to see that. The novelist F Scott Fitzgerald famously critiqued the shallowness of the super-rich via his character, Jay Gatsby, who lined his shelves with books in order to project a cultured image of himself – yet they were “uncut” and had never been read.To one guest at Gatsby’s party, that doesn’t matter – he describes the shelves (that he had at first assumed to be cardboard facades of books) as “a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too – didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”A century on from The Great Gatsby’s publication, it is once again fashionable to decorate using books – and to question the motives of those who do so. InVincenzo Latronico’sInternational Booker-shortlisted Perfection, a novel that highlights the hollowness of chasing a “cool”, “curated” life, Anna and Tom’s self-consciously chic flat features “floor-to-ceiling shelves lined with paperbacks and graphic novels … interspersed with illustrated coffee-table books – monographs on Noorda and Warhol, Tufte’s series on infographics, the Taschen history of typefaces, and another Taschen on the entryways of Milan,” carefully arranged with “succulents in cement plant pots,” and “a waist-level camera” in the place of bookends.Through their home, Latronico writes, the couple has created a picture of a life that is “clear and purposeful” – whether or not that is actually the case.In an age of constant scrolling, there is social capital to be gained by simplylookingas ifyou are a cultured person who listens to music on vinyl and reads lots of books. And creating an aesthetically pleasing bookshelf is now easier than ever, thanks to an increase in booksellers who trade in “books by the metre”.Vintage volumes are particularly popular, as they offer an instant way to create the effect of a long-established library made up of books collected over many years. “My bookshelf is now complete,” reads one customer review onan eBay listingfor a metre’s worth of “randomly selected” antique titles, available for £50.View image in fullscreenEtsy has seen a 19,616% increase in searches for book-lover decor.Photograph: Aire Images/Getty ImagesDayna Isom Johnson, a trend expert at Etsy, another website where some sellers offerbooks by the metre, says the company has “seen a 19,616% increase in searches for book-lover decor” over the past three months, compared with the same time last year.If you’re willing to pay a bit more, sellers will offer a more bespoke service: for example, for £98, the online shopCountry House Librarywill sell you a metre of assorted vintage books that all have orange covers.Madeleine Ovenden is head of non-traditional sales at the publisher Thames & Hudson, which specialises in what might be referred to as “coffee-table books”. She has seen an increase in interior designers wanting to bulk-buy books with spines in similar colours, “to fit a room theme”. The company now sells bundles of coffee-table books that all fit a certain colour or aesthetic –a stack of lemon-yellow Thames & Hudson books, for instance, could be yours for £119.90.Customers will also come to the publisher directly, Ovenden says, with “requests by the metre for certain shelf sizes”.The rise in such requests can be attributed to the popularity of the “bookshelf wealth” interior design trend onTikTok– an extension of the “quiet luxury” and “stealth wealth” aesthetic. A bookshelf that looks like an heirloom family collection, complete with art and ornaments, suggests you care about literature and art – and have time and money to spend on these things.Philip Blackwell curates bookshelves for a living via his company, Ultimate Library, which is used by hotels, businesses and homeowners who want to outsource the task of filling up their bookshelves. Though he is critical of the “books by the metre” trend – Ultimate Library’s selling point is that a knowledgable team will work with the client to select books they might actually read – he acknowledges that, if you’re trying to build a library from scratch, you will almost inevitably have a certain amount of space to fill.I’m speaking to Blackwell at 40 Leadenhall, a newly developed office building in the City of London, where his company was commissioned to create a library for workers to use. “That panel there is 14 linear metres multiplied by 33.” So he and his colleagues have to find 462 metres of books to fill that space, though most will be chosen for more than just their age, size or colour, and will be available to borrow. “Creating a book collection, certainly for a private client, is all about having a discussion, going on a voyage to discover it, and it should be really good fun,” Blackwell says. He likes to quote Cicero: “A room without books is like a body without a soul.” Services like his, then, manufacture that “soul” in places such as offices and hotels that might otherwise be pretty soulless.View image in fullscreen‘Creating a book collection is about going on a voyage’ … 40 Leadenhall’s library.Photograph: Will Pryce/M&GBlackwell’s service might be less superficial than simply using books for wall-dressing, but its appeal is still partly down to clients liking the way that books look. Michael Wood, who works for M&G Real Estate, which owns 40 Leadenhall, says M&G approached Ultimate Library partly because “we’ve got a big space in this ground floor to fill and books are a great way to do that”. Aesthetically, the books make the building’s lobby look less stark – and the higher shelves, which feature older books arranged by colour, are wholly ornamental.“As a decorative element, books are great because they add a lot of texture,” says New York-based interior designer Tommy Landen Huerter. “They add colour in places where it wouldn’t be easy to otherwise integrate it. They just make a home look a lot more lived-in.”There have “definitely been clients I have bought books for that will probably never be opened”, who want full bookshelves “just for the aesthetic”, he says. He has been asked, for example, to style books on high shelves that homeowners will “never be able to reach”.That is partly because books look good, but also because of their value as status symbols, Landen Huerter thinks. “It’s like: ‘Look how well-read I am because I have the time to read and I’m educated enough to know these topics.’” The designer himself has “a weird insecurity” over the fact that visitors to his own home wouldn’t know he reads, since he does so exclusively on an e-reader and therefore doesn’t have any physical books on display. Through your home, “you want to show your interests” he says – but you can also show what you would like peopleto thinkyour interests are, which is the impulse behind clients asking him to buy books in bulk for ornamental purposes. “I can understand why people would say: ‘I haven’t read 100 books in the last year, but I would like to have.’” Just as they do via social media or through clothing choices, people are often trying to present the version of themselves that they wouldliketo be true, rather than what actually is.Presenting the image of being a book lover has never been easier – part of the reason that buying books by length has become a trend is that books can be bought very cheaply, says Matt Hubbard, owner of secondhand bookshop Halcyon Books in south-east London. In the UK and the US at least (the market is slightly less populated in continental Europe), books are published in huge quantities: “We’re definitely spoiled for having a hell of a lot of books around.”Hubbard says he could easily take on more books than he would be able to sell, and some “tatty paperbacks” have such a low value that they end up getting recycled. There is a “sort of a rag trade side of the book business”, where books are bought by weight and sold on “very cheaply” by retailers such as Amazon, eBay and World of Books. This has “hugely depressed the prices” of a lot of secondhand books, he says.View image in fullscreen‘I can understand why people would say: “I haven’t read 100 books in the last year, but I would like to have.”’Photograph: Fotografía de eLuVe/Getty ImagesSelling books by the metre, then, is a savvy way for retailers to get rid of large numbers of titles that would otherwise be difficult to shift.It’s not without its downsides, though. “It promotes this overconsumption of things that don’t really have meaning, that are just for the aesthetic,” says Landen Huerter. The interior designer worries about the rise of “fast-fashion trends” in home decor, similar to what has happened in the clothing industry. When people start to feel they need to follow new trends and constantly change their homes, it creates “a new level of waste and overconsumption”, which “gets away from the whole idea of having a collected and curated space of things that represent yourself, your story and your interests,” he says.Buying books by length allows people to create a kind of “knock-off” version of a richly filled bookshelf put together over years of reading for people who “can’t be bothered to choose the books and read them,” Hubbard says – or who can’t afford a service like Blackwell’s, perhaps.It is easy to be snobby about people who fill their bookshelves in this way – but “we’ve all got lots of books on our shelves that we haven’t read,” Hubbard points out. In Japan, they even have a word –tsundoku– for acquiring books with the best of intentions but letting them pile up without reading them.Though it’s obviously frustrating for true bibliophiles when someone has bought a random selection of books in bulk to decorate their home, the fact there are books in their home at all is a good thing, Blackwell thinks. Having books around means that, at the very least, the opportunity to read one is there.“In my experience”, he says, “there is always the right time and the right place to read a book.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Then the police killed my sonTwenty-five-year-old Bijan Ghaisar was unarmed when he was shot in his car by two officers. Charges against the men were dismissed – but seven years on his mother Kelly is still fighting for her boyAnnie KellyTue 22 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTShareKelly Ghaisar never thought to teach her son, Bijan, to fear the police. She didn’t see the need. After arriving in the US as a young girl fleeing theIranian revolutionin 1979, she had led a charmed life in her adopted country, building a prosperous and happy family with her husband and raising her two children – Bijan and his older sister, Nageen – to believe in the American dream.“We had just lived our life in this bubble, this very lovely bubble,” she says. “Even though we’re both from Iran, we never felt we had to teach our kids that they were different. They were American and we taught them to believe that they were equal and free, the values we thought this country stood for. I never thought that Bijan, a young man of colour, would need to know what to do if he encountered the police. We taught him they were there to protect him, not that he would ever have to protect himself from them.”Now, she says, she knows better. “But of course, it’s too late.”Over the years, the details of Bijan’s death have been told again and again: in court documents, newspaper articles and TV news broadcasts. Online, there are dozens of photos of Kelly, standing on courthouse steps surrounded by family members holding pictures of her son. Yet every time she recounts the details of the night he was killed, she tells it as if she were there, right next to him, watching helplessly as the final, tragic chapter of his young life played out.View image in fullscreenKelly and Bijan on Mother’s Day in 2017.Photograph: Courtesy of Kelly GhaisarOn Friday 17 November 2017, 25-year-old Bijan, who worked in his father’s accounting firm, was in his Jeep Grand Cherokee driving along the George Washington Memorial Parkway in northernVirginia, just across the river from Washington DC, when he was rear-ended by an Uber driver. After the accident, Bijan didn’t stop – Kelly doesn’t know why – and the passenger inside the Uber called 911 to report the incident and said that Bijan had fled the scene.The 911 dispatcher put out a call identifying his vehicle and he was spotted by Lucas Vinyard and Alejandro Amaya, two DC park police (a federal law enforcement agency) officers,who started a pursuit. They were joined by a police car from Fairfax county, Virginia, which recorded what followed.The park police officers pulled Bijan’s car over, got out of their vehicle and approached him, their guns raised and pointing into his car.Kelly thinks that Bijan panicked. “Before he was killed, he had never been in trouble, had never even had a speeding ticket,” she says. “And suddenly he was in this very frightening situation and he was very, very afraid of guns. He had an almost pathological fear of them. I know my child and I know he would have been terrified.”In the video footage of the encounter, which Fairfax county police released a few months after Bijan’s death, you can see Bijan’s Jeep driving away and then stopping a second time and Amaya running to the vehicle with his gun drawn, banging it against the window. Bijan drives off again and there is a short chase before he pulls over again and the park police stop in front of his Jeep.As Bijan’s car rolls slowly forward, Amaya jumps out of his car with his gun unholstered and fires repeatedly through the windshield. Bijan’s car begins to roll into a ditch as Amaya is joined by Vinyard and then they shoot into the car again. After the car stops, Amaya reholsters his gun, before pulling his weapon out again and firing through the windshield. “They just kept firing,” says Kelly quietly. “They shot my son, who was unarmed, 10 times in the head at close range. The whole incident from start to finish took less than 10 minutes.”Across town, Kelly and her husband, James, were at home with no idea that their lives as they had known them had come to an end. “Everything was great, the kids were great, it was all perfect,” she says. “I was an interior designer, James was an accountant, we had a beautiful home.” That night, “the whole thing fell apart.”At 1am two park police officers knocked on the front door. From the very first interaction, Kelly knew things were wrong. They told the couple that there had been a shootout and Bijan was in the hospital. “Like some gangster thing happened,” says Kelly. “And I said: ‘A shootout? That’s not possible.’ Because Bijan was so anti-gun, he would never have had a gun in his car. So from those very first moments they were lying to us.”View image in fullscreenKelly Ghaisar attends a vigil for Bijan in Washington DC in 2019, wrapped in her son’s American flag.Photograph: Washington Post/Getty ImagesThe officers gave the Ghaisars their card and told them to call them when they got to the hospital. “And we never saw them again,” says Kelly. “They never, ever picked up the phone when we tried to call.”When they arrived at the hospital, they were told that Bijan was in a coma, hovering between life and death.“I said: ‘I want to see my son.’ And the doctor said: ‘I’m sorry, you can’t,’” says Kelly. The hospital staff told them they had received an email from the park police saying nobody should be let into Bijan’s room.“We were all so shocked. The hospital said it had never happened before. Nobody in the police told us what had happened to our child but they had armed officers guarding his body.”Kelly says: “100% there was racism there, all the way through. It just felt like: ‘He’s this Middle Eastern guy, we shot him, end of story. You don’t have the same rights as everybody else.’”Kelly and her husband and daughter stayed at the hospital, sleeping on air beds in a waiting room for the 10 days it took Bijan to die. During that time they were only allowed to see their son once an hour for a few minutes at a time and they were never allowed to hold him. “He was in a coma but they said that he was evidence and we couldn’t touch him.”My brother was shot dead – and then my nephew. Now I’m trying to make our city a safer placeRead morePhotos of Bijan published after his death show a relaxed young man, grinning into the camera. “He was a special person,” says Kelly, with maternal pride. “Everybody thought so. He had this huge heart, was so considerate and generous and so handsome. His whole life was ahead of him.” Her last memories of her son are of “his beautiful face just completely destroyed. When they took off the bandages, they had shot off one of his ears, his nose was severed, his eyes were swollen. He was unrecognisable.”With everything that has happened since, Kelly says what seemed at the time like pointless cruelty now makes sense. “They wanted us to suffer,” she says. “They wanted us to be scared. They wanted us to know their power.”Switching off Bijan’s life support was “the hardest decision that I will ever make in my life, even though we knew that there was nothing we could do to bring him back, that he was never going to recover,” she says. “But I did not want my son, whatever was left of him, to be in the grip of these people. They weren’t allowed to be near him any more.”Bijan’s death was, Kelly says, “not just a loss. It was an absolute catastrophe. An obliteration.” The family lost more than their son that day: “We lost our faith in our country, our government. We saw that nothing, absolutely nothing we had believed about our country was true. That the system we thought was there to protect us was now going to fight us to protect their own people and we would be the only ones calling for justice for Bijan.”View image in fullscreen‘Bijan is the force holding me up’ … Kelly Ghaisar at home in Virginia.Photograph: Greg Kahn/The GuardianIn the seven and a half years since Bijan’s death, Kelly and her family have relentlessly fought the US government for accountability. She says that at every turn it has been denied.“When you are fighting the federal government and they close ranks, there is nowhere to go,” she says. “The park police are federal police. The FBI is a federal department. The courts are there to protect the federal government. There is no way to get justice if the justice department is against you.”The family spent two years waiting for an FBI investigation into Bijan’s shooting before the justice department announced it would not file federal charges against the two officers.For 16 months, Kelly says, the park police refused to identify the officers who shot Bijan or release any information about the case until the Ghaisars filed a wrongful death civil lawsuit in 2018. When Amaya and Vinyard eventually took the stand, they said they shot Bijan in self-defence. In 2023 the civil suit was settled for $5m.The Ghaisars’ long fight has not been without flares of hope. In 2020 a Fairfax grand jury indicted Vinyard and Amaya for manslaughter, which Kelly says “felt like a turning point”. Then, in October 2021, a federal judge dismissed all criminal charges against the officers on the basis of qualified immunity laws, which protect government workers from prosecution for actions taken within their official capacity if it can’t be proved that they violated constitutional or statutory rights or acted with “malicious intent”.“The judge said that these two men were fine police officers and what they did was ‘necessary and proper’,” says Kelly. “This is how our system works, that a judge can write these words about the killing of an unarmed 25-year-old man. That it was necessary and proper.”Amaya and Vinyard were put on paid leave after Bijan’s death. In January this year, in a huge blow to the Ghaisar family, they went back to work at the park police. “Which didn’t surprise me but did disgust us all,” says Kelly. She says she will never accept that this is the end. “I will not stop fighting for Bijan, not while I still live and breathe.”View image in fullscreenA vigil for Bijan Ghaisar in Washington DC in 2018.Photograph: Washington Post/Getty ImagesIn 2018 the family started theBijan Ghaisar Foundationto support organisations fighting gun violence and police brutality, and to lobby for stricter gun protection laws. In particular, Kelly has become an impassioned campaigner against qualified immunity. “This is my number one goal, my life mission,” she says. “I’m not naive any more – I know this probably won’t happen in my lifetime – but that doesn’t mean I’m going to stop for a second.”Although Bijan’s photos are still all over their house and Kelly visits his grave every day, the old family traditions – the movie nights, the identical festive pyjama sets – have gone. “When my daughter and son-in-law are around for the holidays, we all sit down, get out our laptops and strategise the next steps for our foundation,” she says. “This is what we do together now.”She is no longer the same person, she says. “The person I was before Bijan was killed has completely gone. She is gone. When you bring a life into the world and nurture that life and watch it grow into something as special as our son was, to see it just taken away so thoughtlessly, so pointlessly – it could have broken me for good. But I’ve found a fire and a strength within me that I never thought was there, and that is down to Bijan and my love for him.”She has survived thanks to her friends, her family and her activism. “But number one is Bijan. He is the force holding me up, giving me strength and light and love to do what I’m trying to do.” People ask her how she hasn’t been corroded away by bitterness, grief or rage. “And I say: Bijan would not want that. Any negative energy was wrong to him, so I’m just channelling his spirit every day, and every day I get stronger. Because this is what Bijan would want me to do. Never give up.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s what we turn to in times of strife, when spirits are flagging, or to start our day. And when a visitor calls, one of the first things we do is put the kettle on.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.While many small appliances have evolved beyond their original form, the kettle’s basic principles remain largely unchanged. Water goes in and heats up until a thermostat switches it off; the water then pours out, and we enjoy a cuppa. However, the technology that goes into a kettle has been slowly improving: better insulation to keep water hotter for longer and reduce reboils; different temperature settings to suit every drink from green tea to herbal brews; and more features such as filters and concealed elements to keep scale out of our cups.When your existing kettle makes its last brew and must be taken to the big recycling centre in the sky, it pays to check out what’s on offer to replace it. The next one you buy may make more of a difference to your day than you might think.At a glanceBest kettle overall:Bosch Sky kettle£76 at AmazonBest budget kettle:Kenwood Ripple kettle£29.99 at KenwoodThe forever kettleDualit Classic kettle£140 at CurrysBest quiet kettle:Zwilling Enfinigy Pro kettle£139 at ZwillingBest budget variable temperature kettle:Lakeland Digital double-walled kettle£44.99 at LakelandWhy you should trust meWhen a friend heard I was writing this, she asked me, “Aren’t all kettles the same? They all boil water, don’t they?” And while she’s right about the second part, it took me at least 15 minutes to explain why she was wrong about the first. I’ve been testing kettles for years and they vary greatly – in design, weight, ease of maintenance, ease of use and build quality. Some will last for decades while others will barely make it past the basic guarantee period. In short, yes, all kettles boil water – but they are far from being all the same.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach kettle was hooked up to a power meter to assess electricity consumption.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianAs you can imagine, I boiled a lot of water. Litres upon litres of the stuff. Enough to turn my kitchen into the steamiest hammam and clear my pores of blackheads I’ve had since I was a teenager.But testing wasn’t just about making gallons of tea and having a deep skin cleanse on the cheap. I also brought a lot of gadgets to the party: a power meter to assess electricity use for each kettle when boiling exactly one litre of water from cold; a timer to measure how long that took; and a probe thermometer to gauge how long it took for the kettle to click off once it had reached boiling point.External temperature was measured using an infrared thermometer and the highest reading noted, while maximum noise levels were recorded with the Decibel X app. After boiling, water temperature was checked at the 30-minute, one- and two-hour points to see how much it had cooled.I tested 12 kettles in total. Those we tested but haven’t included areCurrys Essentials C17JKW17 jug kettle, which is a snip at £8.99 but lacks durability, and theRussell Hobbs Travel Light white small kettle 23840, which is probably one of the best travel kettles you can buy at £20, but took almost six minutes to boil its 850ml.The ones that made the cut were selected on the basis of good energy efficiency or low minimum fill, plus ease of use or maintenance. Value for money has also been considered, as have longer guarantees and durable build quality that should translate into a lengthy lifespan for the appliance. All samples have been returned to their supplier or donated toCaterham Round Tableto raise funds for local causes and charity projects.The best kettles in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBest kettle overall:Bosch SkykettleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£100 at John Lewis£76 at AmazonOffering variable temperatures and a double-walled stainless-steel housing, the 3kW Sky is a brilliant blend of robust form and function. It boasts a low minimum boil (300ml), a keep-warm setting and touch controls.Why we love itI found it difficult to select a best kettle from so many that performed well, but the Bosch Sky clinched it because it’s such a good all-rounder that will suit most people. It pours well, has a button that’s within easy reach of the handle so it’s simple to open the lid without touching it, and it’s insulated so the exterior doesn’t become too hot to touch. From a design perspective, it has a more industrial feel than many others – no frippery here – but not too modern that it wouldn’t fit into most kitchens. Its display is thoughtfully designed, easy to keep clean and lights up as it heats.The exterior doesn’t get too hot (up to 40C), and while it wasn’t the fastest to boil in testing, it was only seconds behind the Dualit below. It clicked off at boiling point, and the water was still a toasty 78C 30 minutes later. At the hour point, it was 66C, and two hours 52C, meaning you’ll spend less time and energy reboiling.It’s a shame that …its premium look ends at the handle, which seems cheap and plasticky next to the sleek aesthetic of the rest of it.Time to boil one litre:2mins 22secsMinimum fill:300mlPower use:0.112kWh = 3p at 25.73p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximumnoise recorded:59dBTemperature settings:70C, 75C, 80C, 85C, 90C, 95C, 100C, keep warmWarranty:two yearsBest budget kettle:Kenwood RipplekettleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£29.99 at Kenwood£29.99 at AmazonAvailable in four “ocean-inspired” shades – eggshell blue, storm blue, pure white and midnight black – Kenwood’s Ripple kettle has a subtle design that belies its affordable price tag. It’s practical, too: there’s a 3kW element, a wide pouring spout to prevent drips, and two water windows showing cups on one side and litres on the other (making it left-hander friendly).Why we love itMore affordable kettles tend to demand a higher minimum fill – usually 500ml – but the Ripple enables those on a budget to boil a single cup (200ml), providing excellent energy economy. There’s even a plastic marker inside for one and two cups and max, so you don’t need to watch the water window as you’re filling. It’s lightweight at 950g without feeling flimsy, has a pull-off lid for easier filling, and it boiled quickly in testing, retaining its heat well for the first 30 minutes (72C) and hour (60C).It’s a shame that …the lightweight plastic body meant that the external temperature was very hot after boiling (80C). Its two-hour temperature (44C) was also much cooler than the one-hour point, meaning more energy is needed to reboil.Time to boil:2mins 30secsMinimum fill:200mlPower use:0.118kWh = 3p at 25.73p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximum noise recorded:57dBTemperature settings:100CWarranty:one yearThe forever kettle:Dualit ClassickettleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£140 at Currys£149.99 at John LewisAlthough it comes with a higher initial outlay, Dualit’s Classic kettle is more of a “buy right, buy once” appliance. It’s as robust as they come, with a durable stainless-steel body, hinged lid, anti-wobble feet and non-drip spout. But it’s the repairable nature of this kettle that makes it an eco-friendly buy. The 3kW element is replaceable, so a pro can swap it for a new one or repair it if it wears out, meaning you may never need to buy a new kettle again.Why we love itRepairability aside, the Dualit Classic kettle also makes it easy to boil only as much water as you need, with a low minimum fill (250ml) and dual water windows indicating cups and litres via multiple markings. There’s no button to raise the lid, meaning one less thing to go wrong; instead, it has a heatproof plastic handle. It was also the fastest boiling of all the kettles tested and clicked off bang on boiling point.It’s a shame that …the exterior gets hot after boiling – our sample reached 71C. It also lacked a choice of temperatures and a keep-warm function, despite the higher price.Time to boil one litre:2mins 15secsMinimum fill:250mlPower use:0.114kWh = 3p at 25.73p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximum noise recorded:57dBTemperature settings:100CWarranty:one yearBest quietkettle:Zwilling Enfinigy ProkettleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£139 at Zwilling£139 at CurrysTaking variable temperature kettles to new heights, the Enfinigy Pro kettle doesn’t just feature different temperatures for your tea and a keep warm option, it also boasts a baby bottle sterilisation setting.

I also appreciated the clear display and choice of temperatures, as well as the reassuring lifetime warranty. It was easily the quietest when boiling and didn’t grow hot on the exterior, reaching a cool-touch 31C. Heat retention was brilliant: after 30 minutes, the water was still 81C, dropping to only 71C after an hour and 57C after two.It’s a shame that …it’s a seriously slow boiler, due to its 1.85kW element, and it continued to boil for three seconds after reaching 100C.Time to boil:4mins 7secsMinimum fill:500mlPower use:0.121kWh = 3p at 25.73p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximum noise recorded:43dBTemperature settings:40C, 60C, 70C, 80C, 93C, 100C, keep warmWarranty:lifetimeBest budget variable temperature kettle:Lakeland Digitaldouble-walledkettleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£44.99 at Lakeland£44.99 at AmazonLakeland’s Digital double-walled kettle proves you don’t have to splash the cash for a well-insulated, variable temperature kettle – or one with a decent warranty length. With a powerful 3kW element, a wide choice of temperatures and a keep-warm setting, plus easy controls, it’s hard to ask for more at this price.Why we love itWhat impressed me most about this kettle, aside from its choice of 13 temperatures, was its large, clear display. It’s easy to read from afar, and the temperature is easy to set with plus and minus buttons. The kettle looks and feels premium for the price, with its measurements all marked on the interior.The double-walled construction served it well: the exterior reached only 27C, while the water was still 78C after 30 minutes, dropping to 67C after an hour and 53C after two.

It’s well insulated too, with the exterior only reaching 32C after boiling and the water still registering a balmy 57C after two hours.It didn’t make the final cut because …its 1.8kW element meant it was slow to boil, and it took about six seconds to click off after reaching boiling point.

However, there’s no getting away from the fact that it’s one of the priciest while not offering much more than the others. The good stuff: it’s stylish, has excellent build quality and a 3kW element that boiled very fast. It also clicked off as soon as it reached 100C, and has a base that allows the cable to emerge from anywhere it pleases. There’s an extensive choice of colours, too, plus a soft-rise lid for minimal splashes.It didn’t make the final cut because …minimum fill appears to be 500ml, although it’s not marked as such, and the external temperature reached a sizzling 99C after boiling. Heat retention was decent at first – 70C after 30 minutes – but after two hours, it had reduced to a tepid 41C, meaning more energy is required for a reboil.Time to boil one litre:2mins 17secs;minimum fill:500ml;power use:0.114kWh = 3p at 25.73p per kWh;matching toaster?Yes;maximum noise recorded:60dB;temperature settings:100C;warranty:two yearsTower ScandikettleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£24.99 at Tower£24.99 at WayfairBest for:an affordable luxury kettleIf the price of the two stylish kettles above has you wincing, fear not: you can bag an attractive kettle for less than £30. Enter Tower’s Scandi kettle, available in black or two shades of matt grey, all of which have faux wood and chrome-effect detailing. There’s good stuff besides the design, too: it’s lightweight (940g), has a speedy boiling 3kW element, and water windows on both sides that are marked with cups and litres.It didn’t make the final cut because …the minimum fill is 500ml, and it took six seconds to click off after reaching 100C. It’s also not very well insulated: the exterior reached 84C after boiling, and while the water temperature was 72C 30 minutes after boiling, it registered at only 44C two hours later.Time to boil one litre:2mins 21secs;minimum fill:500ml;power use:0.117kWh = 3p at 25.73p per kWh;matching toaster?Yes;maximum noise recorded:59dB;temperature settings:100C;warranty:one yearWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenWhat key features should I look out for?How you use your kettle will probably dictate which functions you’ll find the most useful, but generally, any feature that helps to save energy is valuable. For example, kettles that are dual-walled help to trap heat inside, so the water stays warmer for longer while the outside stays cool to the touch.Those with low minimum fills enable you to boil just enough water for a single cup, so you don’t waste energy heating more than you need. Some kettles also have a keep-warm function that stops the water cooling below a certain temperature, which is ideal for those who become distracted after boiling or drink consecutive cuppas. It’s a good idea to check for safety features too, such as an auto shut-off to prevent it from boiling dry if there’s not enough water.Other features are more “nice to haves”: variable temperature models enable you to choose water heated to lower temperatures than boiling, such as 70C or 80C, for other types of tea or for filling a hot-water bottle. Concealed elements, which are easier to keep scale-free, and removable, washable limescale filters will be useful for those who live in hard-water areas. Then there’s connectivity. While wifi-enabled and voice-controlled kettles can feel a little gimmicky, they can be a gift for busy parents who usually have their hands full.Are rapid-boiling kettles faster than normal ones?Rapid-boil kettles don’t have a strict industry definition, so while a rapid-boil kettle should boil water quickly, it may not differ much from one that’s not labelled as such.A more reliable indicator of how fast a kettle will boil is its power rating: this is listed either in watts (eg 3,000W) or kilowatts (eg 2.2kW). The higher the number, the more power its element can use to heat water quickly. However, this isn’t the whole story: boiling times can also be quicker in double-walled kettles (as they lose less heat to their surroundings) and those with concealed or flat elements (which provide more surface area to heat the water than a coil).How to descale your kettleLimescale reduces your kettle’s efficiency, costing you more to boil each time, and shortening the appliance’s lifespan. Descale it monthly, especially if you live in a hard-water area. Standing water encourages the buildup of limescale, so try not to leave water in the kettle after use.While you can buy descaler in the supermarket, a lower-cost and more eco-friendly option is to combine a weak food-safe acid, such as white vinegar or lemon juice, with water. Fill the kettle three-quarters with either water and the juice of one lemon or equal parts water and vinegar. Let it soak for an hour, then boil the kettle (once for vinegar, three times for lemon). Once it’s cooled, rinse thoroughly. If your kettle has a removable filter, take it out and rinse it under running water at the same time.Rachel Ogden has worked as a consumer journalist for decades, becoming an expert unboxer before it was a thing, although she’s much lessadept at repacking.

Emailfeast@theguardian.comAnna BerrillTue 22 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhat batch cocktails are best for summer parties?Ella, by emailFirst things first: stand down that cocktail shaker. When you have more than a handful of people over, you need drinks that scale up easily. And apalomanever fails to hit the hot weather happy-hour spot, says Max Venning, director ofThree Sheets barsin London and co-author ofBatched and Bottled Cocktails. “It’s great for a garden party, because you just whack it all in a jug and into the fridge in the morning, then all you need are iced glasses and soda water.” Combine 350ml good-quality blanco tequila (“OchoorVolcanare my go-tos”), 250ml fresh pink grapefruit juice, 10ml tomato vinegar (“or white balsamic”) and two tablespoons of caster sugar, stir until the latter dissolves, then chill. “While you’re waiting for your guests, coat half the rim of your glasses with a mix of salt, a touch of ground black pepper and a sprinkle of ground cumin: wipe half the outside rim with grapefruit, put the salt mix on a small plate and gently press the wet part of the glass into the salt, so it sticks.” When you’re good to go, fill each glass with ice, fill halfway with the paloma mix, top with soda and stir gently: “Garnish with edible flowers or a grapefruit slice.”Another party starter, says Alex Lyonness, bar manager atLucain London, is anaked and famous, which, happily, is “quick to batch because it’s equal parts mezcal, Aperol and yellow chartreuse, and quick to build because it’s 60ml of that mixed with 20ml lime juice”. Sandia Chang, meanwhile, would lean more towards a “lighter” negroni: “We often pre-batch a cocktail that’s a cross between anamericanoand awhite negroni,which is equal partsLillet BlancandSuze,” says the co-founder ofBubbleshopandKitchen Table, who serves that mix of classic French aperitifs over ice and topped up with soda.If you’re looking to bung things together a little further in advance, try a cherry americano, Venning says: “Mix 300ml Campari, 300ml sweet vermouth and 100ml cherry cordial, and store in a clean, sealed wine bottle in the fridge.” To serve, pour 50ml of the mix over ice, top with soda water and garnish with an orange slice. Or, if you’re feeling fancy, pour 30ml into a flute, top with sparkling wine and garnish with an orange twist. If you’re heading out, though, perhaps to the park or beach, Venning’s batch drinking concept (to be consumed in moderation, naturally) would be a “British coastal negroni”: It’s lighter than the classic, and a perfect sundowner. Mix 200ml Campari (“or, for a brilliant British take on it,Forgotten’s ultrasonic bitter aperitivo”), 200ml red vermouth (“I useVault Aperitivo’s Forest”, staying on the British theme), 200ml gin (“Hepple, for preference”), 20ml blackcurrant cordial, 100ml water and two drops of optional orange flower water, then tip that into a Thermos with a handful of ice cubes.Of course, cocktails don’t necessarily mean booze: “When I was pregnant, Chang recalls, “I often made delicious, flavoured iced teas to take to the park, and a particular favourite washojichatea infused with slices of lime, mint and a little brown sugar.” She also recommends iced green tea with honey and apple marigold. Now that’s sure to keep everyone sweet.Got a culinary dilemma?

Here, I’ve used strained greek yoghurt instead, to add depth to these simple tomato toasts and for a creamy balance to the smoky salsa backdrop. It makes a simple and delicious starter for an alfresco dinner. To follow, a simple,spatchcockedchicken slathered in a smoky, brick-red chipotle paste that is mouthwateringly good.Spatchcocked chicken with smoky mojo (pictured above)Prep5 minMarinate2 hr+Cook1 hr 10 minServes4-61 large head of garlic2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves150ml olive oilSea salt80gachiote paste1 tsp brown sugar3-4 tbsp chipotles en adobo, to taste1 large chickenTo serveLimes, cut into wedgesSoured creamBash the garlic with a rolling pin, slip off the skins and finely chop the cloves with a sharp knife. Empty them into a small pan with the thyme and oil, season with half a teaspoon of sea salt, and heat gently, until the oil starts shimmering and the garlic begins to sizzle. Turn the heat to its lowest setting so that bubbles barely break the surface, and cook for 25 minutes, or until the garlic is soft. (Be careful to keep the heat low or the garlic will burn and become bitter).Add the achiote, the brown sugar and three tablespoons of the chipotle. Taste, season with salt and add more chipotle if you want more smoke and heat (remember it will be tempered by the chicken and in the cooking).Meanwhile, to spatchcock the chicken, use a pair of strong scissors to cut along each side of the back bone, then pull it out and discard or save for stock (or ask a butcher to do this for you, though it takes only a few minutes.) Flip over the chicken so it is breast-side up, and press down with your hands to press it down and flatten it. The chicken is now spatchcocked.Slather half the marinade all over the chicken, then cover and put in the fridge to marinate for a few hours, or overnight (keep the rest of the marinade in the fridge for another time, and for up to a month). An hour or two before you want to cook, take the chicken out of the fridge and leave it to come up to room temperature.If you’re cooking outside, light a chargrill or barbecue. Cook the chicken for 25-30 minutes, turning after 15 minutes, until the juices run clear when you insert a skewer into the thickest part of the thigh. If you’re cooking indoors, brown the chicken skin side down on a griddle or under a hot grill for 10 minutes, then finish it off in a moderate oven – 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 – for 20 minutes, until cooked through.Serve with lime wedges and soured cream, plus jacket potatoes, slaw, a nutty, herby quinoa salad or indeed anything else you like to eat in summer.Grilled tomato toasts with smoky sesame-harissa salsaView image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ grilled tomato toasts with smoky sesame-harissa salsa.Prep10 minDrain1 hr+Cook40 minServes2-4200ggreek yoghurt, or labneh2-3 large ripe tomatoesSea salt4 slices sourdough1 smallgarlic clove,peeled and cut in half1 small handful fresh oregano leaves, choppedFor the smoked chilli oil45g sesame seeds150ml olive oil, or rapeseed oil,plus extra for drizzling2 large garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced50g smoky harissa½tspcumin seeds15ml cider vinegarPut the yoghurt in a fine sieve and leave to drain; if you do this overnight, you will get a more cheese-like product, but you will still have a lovely thick spread after leaving it for an hour.

Both my wife and I come from a conservative background; we believe that sex before marriage is a sin and saved ourselvesuntil we got marriedin our early 30s.Before getting married, Imasturbated but never had any real sex. Our first nightturned out to be a disaster. I couldn’t getan erection. However, as the days passed, we managed to have sex but not to my wife’s satisfaction, because I finished within 30 seconds of penetration.I think Isuffer from botherectile dysfunction (ED) and premature ejaculation (PE).My ED is not consistent – I have been prescribed Viagra and use it sometimes – but my PE continues, andis taking a toll on us. My wife isuninterested in sex because she doesn’t get anything out of it. It has been about 15 years now and we havetwo kids but our sex life has not improved. I tried couples counselling but that was more about building a bond between us(which I believeis not an issue as we love each other and can’t think about being with someone else). The only missing piece in our life issatisfying sex. Iwoulddo anything to satisfy my wife but I am feeling helpless.This may seem radical to you, but a woman does not need a penis in order to be satisfied. I recommend that you learn how to give her an orgasm before you penetrate her. There are many places to find instruction about doing this, but basically you need to learn where her clitoris is and how you can touch her in an arousing and ultimately satisfying manner. Embarking on this type of exploration may seem daunting but if you can approach it as a loving couple you may be successful. Of course, your wife will have to be willing to work on this, so you will have to talk to her first and be sure she consents. The best way forward would really be to work as a couple with a good sex therapist, who could also treat your early ejaculation.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

Last bank holiday weekend, with a 13th birthday to celebrate and a row of suns on the weather app, we found a solution. Our family of four, plus two of my sons’ friends, would drive two hours west, to Devon. We’d stay by the sea, go cycling and swimming, play Perudo and sit around a campfire, eating birthday cake. And be home the next day. We’d be 24-hour party people. Only less rock’n’roll, more rock pools and bacon rolls.Brandy Head mapThe catalyst was discoveringBrandy Headon a Google Maps scroll. Like a mini youth hostel, sleeping six, with one double bed, two twin bunks, a shower room and an open-plan living, dining and kitchen area, this boxy little building sits on the clifftops between Sidmouth and Budleigh Salterton, accessible only on foot. Perched nearly 60m above sea level, its terrace is the big selling point, enjoying such gull’s-eye views of the sea that it feels like surfing a very tall wave every time you step on to it.Those views now bring a steady stream of guests to Brandy Head, but in the past they brought the RAF – the building was originally put up in 1940 as an observation post for the top secret Gunnery Research Unit based at RAF Exeter. Apparently, it was here that Prof Sir Bennett Melvill Jones perfected the revolutionary aircraft gunnery sight that helped give allied air forces superiority on D-day. Restored from dereliction five years ago by Nell and Sam Walker, tenants of neighbouring Stantyway Farm, in partnership with their landowner, Clinton Devon Estates, Brandy Head opened as a hikers’ hut in 2021.View image in fullscreenA bike trail in Haldon Forest Park, near Exeter.Photograph: Andrew Lloyd/AlamyNot only would a stay steeped in military history entertain the boys but it was also close to Haldon Forest Park for mountain-biking, and two beaches for swimming, paddleboarding and a dependable supply of ice-creams.We stopped atHaldon Forest Parkon the way – and the boys and my husband, Richard, collected their pre-booked bikes and sped off along the park’s trails to hurtle over jumps, bridges and boardwalks. I swerved pedals in favour of hiking boots and headed toCanonteign Falls, another find from map scrolling, just 15 minutes’ drive away.Snaking down lanes fizzing with cow parsley and red campion, and through thatched villages, it felt like driving into the 1950sHome to what the website describes as the highest waterfall in south-west England, Canonteign is a collection of lakes, woodland walks and gardens with a cafe and adventure playground. Its showpiece waterfall was created in the late 19th century, but the real magic lies beyond it, in the fern garden, planted in Victorian times. Largely forgotten, it has been restored by the current owners and the fern expert Julian Reed, and forms an atmospheric glade where children hunt for fairies.It was hard to leave this otherworldly spot, but there were boys to collect, and once reunited it was a half-hour drive to the sea, the back of the car a happy, flat-batteried fug of post-ride exhaustion. Snaking down lanes fizzing with cow parsley and red campion, and through thatched villages festooned with bunting, it felt less like we were driving to the coast and more like driving into the 1950s.View image in fullscreenBeach time … at Ladram Bay, Devon.Photograph: Ian Woolcock/AlamyNell had left instructions for collecting the keys near Stantyway Farm’s honesty cafe, a former Royal Navy warship container now stocked with tea, coffee, homemade flapjacks, squash and dog biscuits. It’s possible to leave cars here and walk in along a slightly longer route, but we carried on to the end of the lane, from where it’s a 10-minute walk up the fairly steep coastal path to Brandy Head.“This is awesome,” said Alex, one of my sons’ friends, spotting a display of bullets fixed under a plastic tabletop on the building’s terrace, evidence of the ammunition testing that was also carried out here during the second world war. “I’m in the top bunk,” said my newly teenage son Owen, racing to bag his spot. No sooner had we put our supplies in the kitchen and slumped on the sofa than a head popped round the open doorway. “Ooh, can we have a look inside?” As Nell had warned us, visiting walkers are almost as much a feature of a stay here as the terrace is. TheSouth West Coast Pathruns along the front of the building and, while a good proportion of its hikers make up Brandy Head’s bookings, others stop to fill up water bottles from the outdoor tap, or to rest on the benches. If you’re looking for seclusion this is probably not the place, but, as a quirky overnight stay, it added to the charm.“Beach time,” announced Lucas, another friend, when the walkers had left, sliders on, towel slung over his shoulders, chivvying the others out of the door. Turning east, it was a gentle 20-minute walk toLadram Bay, a holiday park with a handy grocery store, a chip shop and a perfect little arc of public beach where we hopped over pebbles to swim in the bracing, briny cool.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We walked to Budleigh Salterton, through theRiver Otter Estuary nature reserve, keeping an eye out for otters, beavers and sandpipers. We watched the boys whoop as they caught the chilly swoosh of more waves – and ate pasties from a kiosk on the beach before driving home.That evening by the firepit, though, Richard and I sat listening to waves breaking far below in the fading light. As hares leapt across the field in front of us, it was comforting to think that Stantyway Farm’s wildlife-friendly approach has meant that land once used to prepare for war was now nurturing habitats forcirl buntingsand peregrines.

Her younger cousin was a chatterbox and a dreamer, she says, “always with plans”.The pair had grown up together as part of a large and close family. Two years after De Menezes had moved toLondonfor a life that Brazil was unable to offer, “Paty”, as he affectionately called her, had been encouraged to follow him to his two-bedroom flat on Scotia Road, along with their younger cousin Vivian Figueiredo, then 20.De Menezes, 27, intended to work another six months as an electrician in London before returning home to Brazil to rejoin his girlfriend, Adriana, she says. They had talked it over during what would turn out to be their final hours with each other in the home they shared. “I love you,” De Menezes had said as he gave Da Silva Armani, then 31, a hug before leaving her side for the last time to go to work.A chance encounter threw me into the campaign to expose the police killing of Jean Charles de Menezes. What happened next changed my lifeRead moreWithin 48 hours, De Menezes, on the way to a job in Kilburn, was lying dead on a tube carriage floor.Policeofficers had mistaken him for Hussain Osman, one of the four men who attempted to blow themselves up on London trains and a bus the previous day in a failed copycat of the 7/7 bombings that had killed 52 people and left hundreds more wounded two weeks earlier.Da Silva Armani collapsed as she identified her cousin in the police morgue on 23 July. But she became a key player in the campaign for justice after compelling evidence of catastrophic police errors and New Scotland Yard’s dissemination of misinformation emerged via leaks to the press. More would come out in two damning Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) reports, the Met’s trial and conviction under health and safety laws, and the formal inquest into the killing in 2008.View image in fullscreenJean Charles de Menezes.Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PAIt was in Da Silva Armani’s name that the campaign then vainly sought to challenge the Crown Prosecution Service at the European court of human rights after a decision was made not to charge any officers over the killing.It is evidently then with some trepidation that she answers the question as to whether she still believes the firearms officers, whose claims that they shouted a warning of “armed police” was not believed by the jury at the inquest, should have been prosecuted.“You may be surprised by my answer: no, absolutely not,” she says. “Because the whole situation led them to this. I take many years to get this conclusion. Many, many years. It’s not easy. You are the first person I said it [to].“The big mistake was in the communications and surveillance and that they allowed Jean to go into the station. When Jean was allowed to go down the escalator at Stockwell station he was already dead. The shooters had no choice, no choice.”It is not a position that everyone remembering De Menezes at Stockwell station at 10.05am – the time of his death – on Tuesday will back. It has taken a lot of tears and reflection to get to this moment, she says.View image in fullscreenIan Blair outside the Old Bailey in London after the Metropolitan police were found guilty of breaching health and safety laws following the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes in Stockwell on 22 July 2005.Photograph: Steve Parsons/PAShe certainly believes that those at the top of the Met then – namely the late commissionerIan Blair, made Lord Blair of Boughtonin 2010, and Cressida Dick, who was running the operation on 22 July 2005 and who rose to lead the Met in 2017 – acted shamefully and should have been held to account for their failings.De Menezes had only been followed by surveillance officers from the flat on 17 Scotia Road that fateful day as a result of Osman having put down number 21 as his address when registering at a gym – the flats shared a communal entrance. Osman’s membership card had been found in the detritus left when his homemade bomb failed at Shepherd’s Bush tube station.There was only one officer in the van outside the property. He was urinating into a plastic container as De Menezes left and had been unable to get an image or a proper look.Dick then decided not to suspend the bus services for fear of alerting the terrorists to their watch. De Menezes got on a bus, got off at Brixton and then got back on when he realised that the tube station was shut. It was wrongly interpreted as possible anti-surveillance measure.Dick would claim that she was led by the surveillance team to believe it was likely to be Osman, who was later arrested in Rome, that they were following. There was a far greater level of doubt than that among the surveillance team. She wanted the firearms team to stop him before he got to the tube station but they were not yet in position to intervene.The armed officers arrived around two minutes after De Menezes at Stockwell. Some accounts had Dick telling her subordinates to stop the suspect from getting on the tube “at all costs”. She denied that language. But the officers running into the tube station said they fully believed that the man they were engaging was a terrorist about to blow himself up.The two shooters, C2 and C12, claimed in their formal statements that they had shouted “armed police” to De Menezes as they rushed at him and that he had risen from his seat towards them.View image in fullscreenA memorial to Jean Charles de Menezes outside Stockwell tube station seen in 2016.Photograph: Stephen Kelly/PANone of the 17 members of the public on the carriage heard any such warning. The jury at the inquest later said they did not believe the officer’s testimony and returned an open verdict after being prohibited by the coroner from an unlawful killing verdict.The operational failures were followed by false claims from Blair and his press office that De Menezes had failed to respond to a police challenge and had been wearing suspiciously bulky clothing. It took a leak from a secretary at the IPCC to ITN’s News at Ten to reveal this as a falsehood.Despite all this, when giving evidence at the inquest, Dick would not countenance suggestions from Michael Mansfield QC, representing De Menezes’ family, that errors had been made. Her only concession: “In any operation some things that in an ideal world would happen, don’t happen.”Da Silva Armani says that the “arrogance” of the two senior officers is what remains with her today. She has learned more recently that the JusticeforJean campaign’s meetings were infiltrated by undercover officers for purposes unknown.She will give evidence at the public inquiry into the so-called Spycops scandal. And yet, she says, she will not give into hate. Blair passed away earlier this month. “I felt nothing, it was strange”.One of the officers, C12, spoke for the first time earlier this year for a Channel 4 documentary. “Everything told me I was going to die and that is why I acted like I did,” he told the programme.Da Silva Armani says she “saw sadness in his eyes”, as she struggles to hold back her own tears. She could not watch the whole interview and felt only pity. “I have to forgive him,” she says.A few weeks ago, her 10-year-old daughter had held back from joining her classmates having their photographs taken with the police officers at the school summer fair in south Croydon. “Because of our cousin”, the young girl had told her concerned mum.“I said to her: ‘Listen to me, what happened with your cousin is an isolated case,’” said Da Silva Armani. “The police is good. The police is here for our protection, to serve us’ … We should not generate hate.” Her daughter joined her friends.Explore more on these topicsJean Charles de MenezesMetropolitan policeIan BlairCressida Dick7 July London attacksLondonPolicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, her situation involves more than just the “clumsy”letter to the Observer in 2023and the radio interview last week referred to by Jason Okundaye (The Diane Abbott row shows how impoverished Britain’s conversations about race have become, 18 July).Blackness may make some of us more easily visible to those with racist attitudes than some other racialised groups, but Abbott should have recognised that her attempt to explain this on Radio 4 was doomed by her declaration that she had no regrets about the earlier incident.It is not that she hasn’t a legitimate point (in embryo), but her first iteration of it was crass and insulting, and her second was politically naive – it makes her apologyissued the day the letter was publishedappear insincere and invites unwelcome attention on her judgment.Okundaye is right to claim that Abbott has been treated badly. But another regrettable issue at the heart of the furore has been largely forgotten: the misconceived,poorly argued Observer articlethat her letter had responded to.Abbott’s response seemed to be distorted by anger when what was required was sober argument. Unfortunately, instead of using her recent interview with the BBC to direct attention back towards the offending article, she bolstered the impression of being preoccupied with comparing racisms. At best, this was an intellectual cul-de-sac to be avoided; at worst, it was bound to sound to her detractors like an echo of her original disastrous faux pas.Paul McGilchristCromer, NorfolkJason Okundaye’s article makes some very important points regarding the impoverishment of public discourse about race in Britain, not least the lack of spaces where these conversations can take place without taking away the dignity of black people, likeDiane Abbott, which is a usual form of racism in Britain and elsewhere. Trying to express experiences of racism takes a lot of courage, especially if you are deemed not worth listening to.I would argue that the deep roots of the British establishment’s poor and/or deliberately ignorant grasp of its imperial, colonial, racist history, and its relationship with its former colonised peoples, contributes to this impoverishment in human development.Coming up with good ideas to promote public understanding of the past (and/or supporting existing efforts to do so – art institutions have been showing a way) might go some way to counter the harmful distortions of reality that people like Nigel Farage are unleashing on especially white people’s anxieties about their place in an ever dangerously polarising world.Fenella JeffersYorkAs someone with Traveller heritage, I agree with Diane Abbott’s comments on the subtle differences of racism. I certainly do not think that Diane is anti-Traveller. Nobody can “see” my Traveller background, which often leads to an assumption in conversations that I share individuals’ prejudices of Travellers. It’s up to me to challenge their views or stay silent. This would not be the same if I was Black.Jackie FisherPreuilly-sur-Claise, FranceIt’s a moot point as to whether Diane Abbott’s comments about discrimination against Jews were antisemitic. What isn’t moot, though, is the idea that you can’t see that someone is Jewish. Does she ever visit Stamford Hill, in her constituency of Hackney North and Stoke Newington? Members of the large Hassidic community there are very obviously identifiable as Jews because of how they dress, which makes them easy targets for antisemitism. I’m willing to accept that Ms Abbott meant no ill will by her comments, but they were, to say the least, silly and thoughtless.Steven BurkemanYorkAs a woman of Jewish extraction, and a constituent of Diane Abbott for 40 years, I am, yet again, appalled by these accusations of antisemitism. What she says is accurate. No one knows my history when I walk down Stoke Newington High Street. Do you expect all Jews to look the like the Hassidim? Surely it is racist to assume all Jews are the same. Diane has been a stalwart of the fight against all racism, which people of colour are up against daily.Liza DoddsStoke Newington, LondonI am an 82-year-old British citizen of Indian origin and I have been concerned about the issue of racism in comments made by Diane Abbott in the past, and the fact that she says she has no regrets.It is probably difficult for white people to understand fully that racism is a complex and often misunderstood phenomenon. As Diane says, if you are white, in most cases other people will not be able to tell at first glance whether you are a Christian or a Jew. But a person of colour will never have that experience.Sadly, I believe that this issue is being used byLabourto justify suspending a fine MP because she speaks about a form of institutionalised racism that pervades our society.

The rebels aren’t persistent – they are principled.Paul WB MarsdenOakenholt, FlintshireI am saddened by the decision to remove the whip from Rachael Maskell. Before the 2019 election, I phoned many potentialLabourvoters in her constituency of York Central.

At Forestry England, forest resilience is our most critical challenge. We must ensure the nation’s 1,500 forests in our care can withstand and adapt to the threats facing them, including climate change, biodiversity loss, extreme weather, and pests and diseases.We are doing this by planning 100 years ahead in the way we manage these beautiful places, which are home to some of the UK’s rarest wildlife. For example, based on rigorous scientific analysis, we have identified the top 30 tree species that will thrive in future environments. This is guiding our investment in our tree nursery and is helping us to ensure that the right tree is in the right place, both today and in the future.The benefits of the nation’s forests are enormous, from storing carbon and mitigating floods to supporting our health and wellbeing. They are an unsurpassed national asset. As their custodians, we are putting forest resilience at the heart of everything we do. The future will look and feel very different to today. Building forest resilience is our opportunity to make sure the nation’s forests continue to evolve, adapt, welcome people and contribute to a sustainable economy.Mike SeddonChief executive, Forestry EnglandExplore more on these topicsTrees and forestsClimate crisislettersShareReuse this content"

It has also continued to fund humanitarian support.The impact assessment said these and other key decisions had “protected against disproportionate impacts on equalities”. However, it highlighted the fact that bilateral projects in a string of countries face cuts, including on education and health.“In Africa, spending is reduced in women’s health, health systems strengthening, and health emergency response, eg in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia,” the impact assessment said.As an example, it warns that cuts to the budget of the Ending Preventable Deaths support programme will result in the “reduction and prioritisation” of support across 11 countries.Superbugs could kill millions more and cost $2tn a year by 2050, models showRead moreThe assessment concludes: “Overall, any reductions to health spending risk an increase in disease burden and ultimately in deaths, impacting in particular those living in poverty, women, children and people with disabilities.”On education, it finds “in-year reductions to education spend are envisaged in Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and in Zimbabwe, and a girls’ education programme in DRC will close early in 2025 to 2026”.It adds: “Adverse impacts on children will be likely, including the most vulnerable and children with disabilities, eg the early closure of the DRC education programme will have negative impacts on 170,000 children in post-conflict rural Kasai.”The impact assessment also pointed out that 11 of the 13 current or future programmes that have been earmarked for closure were “equalities focused”.The slashing of the UK development assistance budget comes as Donald Trump’s administration institutes its own sweepingcuts to US aid, which, among other crushing effects on the world’s poorest people, have resulted inabrupt haltsto life-saving HIV drug programmes in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa.The FCDO assessment was published alongsidethe department’s annual report, which set out more details of how the diminished aid budget will be spent.Lisa Wise, director of global policy at Save the Children UK, said: “The government has confirmed our worst fears – significant reductions in aid spending will result in deaths of the world’s most vulnerable, including children.”She welcomed the confirmation that the government will meet its promise of funding to the World Bank, but added: “International spending must be part of a genuine strategic approach – where the needs of people facing inequality and at risk of crisis are at the heart of development, not one driven by balancing the books.”Gideon Rabinowitz, director of policy and advocacy atBond, the umbrella group for development NGOs, said: “The world’s most marginalised communities, particularly those experiencing conflict, and women and girls, will pay the highest price for these political choices.”He added that the impact assessment only covers the current year, and urged the government to repeat the exercise, as the cuts continue to bite.“Without this, we only have a very limited picture of what the real impact is going to be on the areas facing the brunt of the cuts,” he said.Jenny Chapman, the development minister, said: “We are modernising our approach to international development. Every pound must work harder for UK taxpayers and the people we help around the world and these figures show how we are starting to do just that through having a clear focus and priorities.“The UK is moving towards a new relationship with developing countries, becoming partners and investors, rather than acting as a traditional aid donor.”She has previouslydescribed an aid budget of 0.3% of national income as the “new normal”.The previous Labour government adopted a target of 0.7% of national income for aid spending, which subsequently won cross-party support – butRishi Sunak cut it to 0.5% during the Covid pandemic.Explore more on these topicsAidLabourAfricaUSAIDnewsShareReuse this content"

She said it was a method often used by young men trying to reach the Spanish enclave of Ceuta in north Africa, but added it was less common among those trying to cross the wider stretch of the Alborán Sea between Morocco and Spain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to advocates, the 39-acre camp now holds more than 1,000 men in “flood-prone” tents.Sheinbaum said in an unrelated press conference that 14 of the people detained are confirmed Mexican nationals and she is seeking their repatriation.Hundreds of detainees with no criminal charges sent to Trump’s ‘Alligator Alcatraz’Read more“All arrangements are being made to ensure they are repatriated immediately toMexico,” Sheinbaum said during her morning news conference.The facility’s conditions are reportedly appalling, advocates say, with detained immigrants sleeping in overcrowded pods, along with sewage backups “resulting in cages flooded with feces”, and, in addition, “denial of medical care”.Since the jail opened earlier this month, theTrump administrationand local officials have specifically touted the brutality of the facility, including its remote location in a wetland surrounded by alligators, crocodiles, pythons and swarms of mosquitoes. Officials also appear to revel in the crude name the facility has been given, echoing the long-shut and notoriously harsh prison in San Francisco Bay.In June, Florida authorities proposed the idea of building a temporary facility in the Everglades to assist in the state and the Trump administration’s push to arrest, detain and deport undocumented immigrants.The facility was cobbled together in a matter of days and then Donald Trumpsoon visited, with the US president hailing its extreme environment. According to recentreportingfrom the Miami Herald, Florida’s governor has already committed more than $200m to private contractors for the facility’s operation.Various reports from the facility have described awful conditions. Last week, it was revealed that a 15-year-old boy was held there for a number of days, despite claims by officials that only adults were detained. Journalists and lawmakers have experienced significant difficulty in accessing the facility. Earlier this month, a number of elected politicians visited and said there were “inhumane” conditions inside.During Tuesday’s press conference, advocates and relatives of those detained decried the conditions.“The detention conditions are unlivable. When you expose human beings to human waste in heat, in a hot environment, you propagate germs and therefore illnesses,” said Tessa Petit, the co-executive director of the Florida Immigration Coalition,CBS reported. “People in there have not been allowed to step outside of those cages.”A woman, whose husband is detained in the facility, said that “due to the water, the rain that was here a couple of weeks ago, he has fungus on his feet”, CBS reported.Florida officials have denied the allegations of “inhumane” treatment. The DHS did not respond to a request for comment by time of publication.A Yale School of Public Health study said the area was swarming with over 7 billion mosquitoes, with many carrying viruses.Advocates said that at least six people detained at the Everglades facility have been hospitalized, calling it a “public health crisis”. They are calling for the immediate evacuation of all detainees and for its closure.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationFloridaTrump administrationRon DeSantisMexicoClaudia SheinbaumAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He has spent recent weeks boasting on social media about his apparent success in convincing the White House to pile pressure on Brazil’s supreme court and leftwing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, over his father’s plight.Rubio moves to strip US visas from eight Brazilian judges in Bolsonaro battleRead moreTrump’s most significant move came on 9 July, when the US president announced plans toslap 50% tariffs on Brazilian importsbecause of the supposed“witch hunt” against Bolsonaro, who faces decades in jail for allegedly trying to seize power after being defeated by Lula in 2022.Lula hit back, calling Trump’s move “unacceptable blackmail” and criticising the Brazilian “traitors” for undermining their country’s interests by supporting the tariffs. “They don’t care about our country’s economy or the harm this will do to our people,” Lula said, in an unmistakable reference to the Bolsonaros.On Friday, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio,stripped eight of Brazil’s 11 supreme court judges of their US visasin the latest phase of Trump’s attempt to force the supreme court to drop the coup case against Bolsonaro. Rubio’s move came hours after federal police raided Bolsonaro’s mansion in the capital, Brasília,fitted him with an electronic ankle tagto stop him absconding, and banned him from using social media or communicating with scores of people, including his son, Eduardo, and foreign diplomats.View image in fullscreenJair Bolsonaro shows an electronic ankle monitor, which the supreme court ordered him to wear, at congress in Brasília on Monday.Photograph: Minervino Junior/APOn Monday, Eduardo Bolsonaro condemned Moraes’s “arbitrary” decision to freeze his accounts. “If he thinks this will make me stop, let me be clear: I will not be intimidated and I will not be silenced. I’ve prepared myself for this moment,” he tweeted.The drama looks set to escalate further in the coming days and weeks as the supreme court prepares to announce its verdict in the trial investigating whether Bolsonaro masterminded a plot to seize power through a military coup. Bolsonaro – who, at 70, faces spending the rest of his life behind bars – has repeatedly denied the charges.Bolsonaro supporters have announced street protests for 3 August in an attempt to re-energise their faltering movement, and claim the Trump administration is preparing to announce further sanctions targeting Brazilian authorities. “From here in the US, I’m not speaking in anyone’s name but I can guarantee you this – there will be no retreat,” Eduardo Bolsonaro told CNN Brasil on Friday.‘A family of traitors’: Trump’s Brazil tariffs ultimatum backfires on BolsonaroRead moreOn Monday night, Moraes warned that Jair Bolsonaro could face arrest if his lawyers failed to explain why – in apparent violation of his social media ban – Bolsonaro had made a high-profile public appearance earlier that day at congress, which was widely broadcast on social media.During that appearance the ex-president showed reporters the monitoring tag on his left ankle and called his treatment “cowardice”. “I didn’t kill anyone!” Bolsonaro shouted, adding: “God’s law is what matters to me.”If Trump’s interventions were intended to benefit Bolsonaro, so far theyappear to have backfired. Lula has enjoyed a bounce in the polls, with many Brazilians outraged at Trump’s politically motivated attack on their economy. Those likely to be worst affected by the tariffs – set to come into force on 1 August – include agribusiness companies that have long been loyal to Bolsonaro.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasDonald TrumpTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

An investigative report released by the Gansu provincial party committee on Sunday found a litany of failures in safety and oversight, as well as attempts to cover up the incident, bribe people in charge and modify test results.The report said the principal at the Tianshui kindergarten had wanted to attract more enrolments by “enhancing” the colour and look of the food served to children. The school’s cook bought industrial-grade pigment online, adding it to dishes despite the packages saying it was “not for consumption”.A Weibo screengrab of brightly coloured kindergarten food that had lead paint colourants added to it by kitchen staff.Photograph: weiboOne pigment was found to have lead levels 400,000 times the safe legal limit. The report said the school had previously bought food-safe colouring, at a cheaper cost, but preferred the “brighter” colours.Initially, 235 students were hospitalised after eating the coloured food. Local state media quoted a parent at the time saying children had suffered stomach pain and nausea, and some children’s teeth had turned black. Final tests revealed that 247 students, as well as staff including the principal, had elevated lead levels in their blood as a result of eating the food.Six kindergarten staff, including the principal, have been arrested, accused of knowingly serving toxic and harmful food. Disciplinary investigations have been launched into the actions of 27 others working for the school, hospital and government.However, Sunday’s report revealed mistakes and mishandling at almost every level of the process and response.View image in fullscreenCCTV of kitchen staff adding colourant into flour.Photograph: weiboIt said the Gansu Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention neglected the case after accepting it, and took samples in a way that violated health regulations and led to a “huge difference” in the test results and the actual levels.At the Tianshui Second People’s hospital, at least two children’s test results were illegally “modified” to record substantially lower lead levels, the report said.“The management of Tianshui Second People’s hospital and its laboratory department was chaotic, job responsibilities were not fully implemented, laboratory quality control was not fully implemented and relevant inspection personnel lacked systematic training,” the report said.It also accused the local education bureau of having “turned a blind eye” to the kindergarten – which charges high fees – operating without a proper licence, and not conducting food safety inspections at any private kindergarten for two years. It said officials in charge of preschool education across multiple departments were suspected of accepting benefits and bribes from the Tianshui kindergarten’s major investor and others linked to the school.Caught between a fossil fuel past and a green future, China’s coal miners chart an uncertain pathRead moreThe report said China’s top anti-corruption authorities had filed a case for review and investigation against government officials of multiple levels, and opened an investigation into senior management at the hospital.It said the children had been treated and all but one had been discharged after the first round of treatment, during which lead levels dropped by an average of 40%.“The provincial party committee and the provincial government are deeply saddened by the abnormal blood lead problem in the Brownstone Peixin Kindergarten in Maiji district, Tianshui city, and express their deep apologies to the children and their parents,” the report said.The release of the report was accompanied by reported protests by parents on Sunday evening outside the kindergarten. Footage shared online by Teacher Li, who monitors dissent inside China, claimed to show clashes between police and a few hundred people outside the Tianshui kindergarten.The footage showed officers using physical force, including batons, and angry parents confronting individuals in plain clothes, questioning their use of violence. As police cars appeared to try to escort the plain-clothed individuals away, parents blocked the road, shouting: “Hand over those who beat people up.”Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaChildrenAsia PacificFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

She said that on multiple occasions Emily had named the educator and said the offences had taken place while her nappy was being changed.Within hours of the disclosure, Angela contacted Victoria police’s sexual offences and child abuse investigation team, who encouraged her to take Emily to a doctor for a medical assessment as soon as possible.Clinical notes from an appointment the next day show the doctor was briefed on the allegations before Emily entered the room. When the doctor asked her about daycare, Emily named the educator and said she did not want to go there any more. The doctor said Emily had begun to mumble when asked for more detail.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe doctor then conducted a medical examination before urgently referring Emily to a paediatrician for further examination. According to the clinical notes, Emily’s parents were advised to keep her away from the childcare centre. The doctor noted that police were “involved already for investigation”.Initially, Angela says, police told her not to report the allegations to the childcare centre. Two days after the doctor’s appointment, they sought a statement from the child on tape. But Emily was uncomfortable and unwilling to engage with officers, so no statement was taken.Are we saying that a child’s disclosure and a PTSD diagnosis isn’t enough unless the abuse is caught on tape?AngelaAngela says that four days later an officer had told her they had consulted with senior colleagues and advised her that a magistrate would not be convinced Emily knew the difference between the truth and a lie. They encouraged Angela to tell the childcare centre about the allegations.After Angela reported Emily’s allegations to the centre, the educator was temporarily suspended. The centre engaged a private firm specialising in workplace relations to conduct an investigation, as required by the Victorian government’s reportable conduct scheme.A separate investigation was launched by the state education department to independently consider the allegations and to determine whether any regulatory action should be taken against the childcare centre.Victoria to establish state register of childcare workers within weeks, Jacinta Allan saysRead moreIn a signed statement submitted to both investigations in February, Angela provided contemporaneous notes of her discussions with Emily about what had allegedly occurred to her and detailed accounts of her behaviour and physical symptoms.The investigators also assessed the doctor’s clinical notes. With Angela’s permission, the education department interviewed the doctor.The state government investigator also assessed a letter from Emily’s “accredited mental health social worker”, which independently documented the child’s allegation. This letter did not name the educator.The letter said Emily’s behavioural symptoms were “consistent with sexual assault victims”. It noted that Emily was “triggered going down the same street as the childcare centre” and had allegedly told her parents she did not want to see the educator again.Despite this information, both investigations found the allegations were “unsubstantiated” due to “insufficient evidence”. Under the reportable conduct scheme, this category of finding acknowledges some “significant strong evidence” but not enough to meet the high threshold required to substantiate the claim.Angela says an education department official told her she needed corroborating evidence, such as CCTV footage or a witness, to substantiate the allegations.Surveillance cameras are not mandatory in childcare centres. There was no witness to the alleged incidents.“If this level of evidence doesn’t meet the threshold, what ever could?” Angela said. “Does a perpetrator need to document their own abuse with photos or video … for an allegation to be substantiated?“Are we truly saying that a child’s disclosure, medical corroboration and a PTSD diagnosis from a trauma specialist isn’t enough unless the abuse is caught on tape?”While the allegations were not substantiated, Guardian Australia has confirmed that the same educator has had an allegation of improper non-sexual treatment of a different child upheld.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Documents show the staff member was given training on acceptable behaviours and child safety.In a letter to Angela, the centre’s chief executive said: “We are committed to maintaining a safe and supportive environment from all children and will continue to monitor and review our practices that do not align with this commitment.”I completely understand your concerns and have done everything within legislation that I can do at this stageVictoria police officerLast week the state government told Angela there was “insufficient evidence to prosecute or take regulatory action”.“The outcome does not infer that [the child’s] disclosure was not recognised or taken seriously,” a senior investigator said in correspondence seen by Guardian Australia.The department investigated whether the centre was ensuring the safety, health and wellbeing of children. It assessed the centre’s compliance history and said it would continue to be monitored.‘Is my child safe?’: Jason Clare faces a quagmire in childcare crisis — fixing a sector without controlling all the leversRead moreThese unsubstantiated findings do not feature on working-with-children checks, despite the acknowledgment of some “significant strong evidence”.At present there is no way for childcare centres to share these findings with other providers who may seek to hire the educator in the future.Days after receiving the education department’s findings, Angela questioned why police had not launched their own formal investigation.In correspondence seen by Guardian Australia, Victoria police confirmed they had launched a preliminary investigation in the hope it could proceed without a recorded statement from the child. But this was “unfortunately” not possible as, in their view, the child had only disclosed the alleged offending to her mother.“I completely understand your concerns and have done everything within legislation that I can do at this stage,” a Victoria police officer wrote.Angela says Emily still talks about the alleged offending. She says her daughter, who is now three, remains “deeply traumatised”. But she believes Emily may be willing to make a statement with appropriate support, once she is comfortable with police.Letters from Emily’s counsellor show she is being told she is brave for telling her story. Her social worker says with continued support at home, and in her new childcare centre, Emily “can learn to feel safe again”.* Names have been changed to protect privacyIn Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

Critics say the legislation allows political interference and is a major step backwards in the fight against corruption.Late on Tuesday Zelenskyy signed the bill into law, rejecting calls for him to use his presidential veto, according to reports. The decision has yet to be posted on the government’s website.View image in fullscreenA woman chants while holding a banner that reads ‘Corruption Applauds’ during a protest against a law targeting anti-corruption institutions in central Kyiv on Tuesday.Photograph: Alex Babenko/APEarlier, about 1,500 protesters gathered next to Zelenskyy’s presidential administration complex. They shouted slogans outside his window including “Shame” and “Veto the law” and waved homemade banners denouncing the bill.There were protests in other large cities including Dnipro, Lviv and Odesa. “If the bill goes ahead it will make it harder for Ukraine to join the European Union. We will go back to dictatorship,” said Sasha Kazintseva before Zelenskyy reportedly gave his approval.“We don’t want to be like Russia. Zelenskyy is still our president. But when he does the wrong things we will say so.”Her friend Tetiana Kukuruza held up a cardboard sign with the blunt slogan: “Are you fucking crazy?”She explained: “This is the first time since 2022 that we’ve taken to the streets. We know the names of the deputies who voted for this bill. I’m not saying they are corrupt. But they have interests.”The protesters gathered in a park immediately below a rococo 19th-century government building, the House of Chimeras. The crowd was made up of students, young activists and army veterans, some of them draped in blue and yellow Ukrainian flags. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, also took part, together with his brotherWladimir.Veronika Mol, an artist, said she worried Ukraine was sliding back to the era of Viktor Yanukovych, the corrupt pro-Russian president who fled to Moscow in 2014 after months of street protests.“I’m surprised this has happened. It looks like some madness. I don’t know what their motives are,” she said.“People are the power in Ukraine. Not the president or government. It’s terrible we still have to remind them.”There has been vocal condemnation of the bill from prominent soldiers, a celebrity chef and Ukraine’s media. The writer Illia Ponomarenko said civil society was fighting “the dark side of its own state” in parallel with the war against Russia.He criticised “corruption, abuse of power, lies, lack of transparency, nepotism, impunity, and attacks on democracy and freedom of speech – everything that keeps dragging us back toward the abyss, back into Russia’s colonial criminal stable”.Several of Ukraine’s high-profile international supporters expressed concern. They included the former US ambassador to Moscow Mike McFaul and the Estonian ex-president Toomas Hendrik Ilves. There was also recognition that protesters could freely voice anti-government opinions – unlike in Russia.Ukraine’s application to join the EU is dependent on the progress it makes in fighting corruption. Since 2022, EU countries have provided Kyiv with significant military and economic support running into billions of euros.The European commissioner for enlargement, Marta Kos, criticised the bill’s adoption.“The dismantling of key safeguards protecting [anti-corruption bureau] Nabu’s independence is a serious step back,” Koswroteon social media, saying that the two bodies were “essential” for Ukraine’s EU path.Explore more on these topicsVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A large banner emblazoned with the words Stop the Genocide was held aloft alongside Palestinian flags.A statement from the protesters also took issue with Greece’s increasingly close “economic, technological and military” relationship with Israel. “As residents of Syros but more so as human beings, we are taking action that we hope will contribute to stopping this destruction from the genocidal war that is taking place in our neighbourhood,” it said.Some passengers on the vessel reacted by raising Israeli flags and chanting patriotic slogans, eyewitnesses said.Confirming the incident, Mano Maritime, the Israeli shipping firm operating the vessel, said: “The ship arrived at Syros, encountered a demonstration by pro-Palestinian supporters, and passengers were stuck on board without permission to disembark.”Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, contacted his Greek counterpart, George Gerapetritis, over the incident, the Greek foreign ministry confirmed. It did not release any details of their discussion.In recent years, Greece has become popular among Israeli tourists, reflecting the increasingly close ties between the two Mediterranean nations.Although the protest concluded without injuries nor arrests, the episode highlighted mounting disquiet in Greece over Israel’s actions in Gaza.

She has denied the allegations and has repeatedly sought without success to have the charges quashed.Dati is accused of accepting €900,000 in lawyer’s fees between 2010 and 2012 from a Netherlands-based subsidiary of Renault-Nissan, but of not really working for it. She was an MEP from 2009 to 2019.Investigations have tried to determine whether she was in fact lobbying in the European parliament for the carmaker, an activity that is forbidden.Dati, a former minister for the rightwing French president Nicolas Sarkozy, was appointed as culture minister last yearin a surprise return to governmentduring Emmanuel Macron’s second term in office.She also serves as the mayor of Paris’s7th arrondissement,where she has been a vocal critic of the city’s Socialist mayor, Anne Hidalgo.Dati became the first Muslim woman to hold a major government post in 2007 when she was appointed justice minister.She has said that growing up on a low-income estate on the outskirts of the town of Chalons-sur-Saône, in Burgundy, gave her a greater understanding than most politicians of the French electorate. In 2007, Sarkozy said appointing Dati sent a message “to all the children ofFrancethat with merit and effort everything becomes possible”.When Dati was appointed to government last year she had already been charged in the Renault-Nissan case. She denied any wrongdoing.The Socialist party leader, Olivier Faure, said at the time of Dati’s appointment that the legal investigation was a problem, saying it sent “a bad signal” and went against Macron’s promises of an “exemplary” republic.Investigating magistrates in France have also ordered thatCarlos Ghosn, the former tycoon of Renault-Nissan, be tried in the case, a judicial source told Agence France-Presse. Ghosn, who has been living in Lebanon for years after escaping arrest in Japan, has also denied the charges against him.A hearing on 29 September will decide on the date of the trial.A source following the case told AFP that the trial could be held after the Paris municipal elections, due in MarchGhosn, the former chair and chief executive of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, was arrested in Japan in November 2018 on suspicion of financial misconduct, before being sacked by Nissan’s board in a unanimous decision.He jumped bail late the following year and made a dramatic escape from Japan hidden in an audio-equipment box, landing in Beirut, where he remains as an international fugitive.Both Japan and France have sought his arrest.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropean UnionEuropeRenaultNissannewsShareReuse this content"

It is part of the jubilee, a year-long period of reflection and penance organised by the church every 25 years.Among those attending the 28-29 July event will beFather Cosimo Schena, the suave priest of San Francesco church in the southern Italian city of Brindisi. He became known as “the poet of God’s love” after publishing spiritual poems across his social media accounts and amassing more than 450,000 followers on Instagram.Don Ambrogio Mazzai said the key to his success was keeping his content brief.Schena, 46, is also known for welcoming animals to his parish and in a reel featuring his two dogs he wrote how God’s love and healing could be transmitted “through a wagging hug” or “a paw resting on your sadness”. The priest became more active on social media in 2022 as a way to spread peace and positivity after the pandemic.His evangelisation has not just made him an internet star, he has achieved his aim of attracting more people to mass.“Not just people who live locally,” Schena told the Guardian. “There are people who come from other parts ofItalyand even other countries. Some simply come to say hello, but the important thing is to deliver a beautiful and credible testimony, and to spread God’s universal language of love. I get lots of messages from people seeking help and comfort, and not just from those who believe in God.”Among the influencer clerics expected to attend the jubilee event, which is aimed at Catholic youth, isFather Giuseppe Fusari, a tattooed priest at a church in the northern city of Brescia, who combines his passions – art history and bodybuilding – to share God’s message. Another expected participant, Stefano Maria Bordignon, a friar known online asFraStefano, uses YouTube to read and comment on the gospel. “Following him is like going to mass every day,” wrote the Italian newspaperCorriere della Sera.Father Ambrogio Mazzai, a priest who imparts church teachings alongside photos of himself playing the guitar or holding a glass of wine, won’t be attending the event as he has to preside over a wedding and a baptism. But, the 34-year-old said, the key to his success was keeping his content brief. “I share messages of faith or reflection – sometimes provocative, sometimes ironic,” he added. “You have to communicate concisely and in a way that attracts attention – so no great long sermons.”Explore more on these topicsReligionCatholicismSocial mediaPope FrancisItalyChristianityDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

A 21-month war with Israel has devastated the territory, a conflict triggered by Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel in October 2023.Israel has barred international journalists from entering Gaza since then, leaving most of the world’s news outlets relying on Palestinian freelancers to inform the world.Palestinian text, photo and video journalists working for the international news agency said desperate hunger and lack of clean water is making them ill and exhausted.Some have even had to cut back on their coverage of the war, now in its 22nd month, with one journalist saying “we have no energy left due to hunger”.The UN in June condemned what it claimed was Israel’s “weaponisation of food” in Gaza and called it a war crime, as aid agencies urge action and warnings about malnutrition multiply.Israel says humanitarian aid is being allowed into Gaza and accuses Hamas of exploiting civilian suffering, including by stealing food handouts to sell at inflated prices or shooting at those awaiting aid.Witnesses and Gaza’s civil defence agency, however, have repeatedly accused Israeli forces of firing on aid seekers, and the UN has said the military has killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food since late May.“For months, we have been witnessing, powerless, the dramatic deterioration of their living conditions,” AFP said, adding that the situation had become untenable despite the “exemplary courage, professional commitment and resilience” of its local team.AFP said it had succeeded in evacuating eight staff members and their families from Gaza between January and April 2024, after months of effort. It is now seeking to secure safe passage for its freelance Palestinian reporters, despite “the extreme difficulty of leaving a territory under strict blockade“.The Israeli military and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the AFP statement.Reuters, another news agency, also works with freelance journalists in Gaza and said it was “deeply concerned” about their health and safety.“The extreme difficulty sourcing food is leading to their and all Gaza residents experiencing greater levels of hunger and illness,” a Reuters spokesperson said.“We are providing our contributors with additional financial support to help them and, should they wish to leave the territory, we will provide any assistance possible to help them get out.”Bashar Taleb, 35, is one of four AFP photographers in Gaza who were shortlisted for the Pulitzer prize earlier this year. He lives in the bombed-out ruins of his home in Jabalia al-Nazla in northern Gaza.“I’ve had to stop working multiple times just to search for food for my family and loved ones,” he said. “I feel for the first time utterly defeated emotionally.“I’ve tried so much, knocked on many doors to save my family from starvation, constant displacement and persistent fear but so far to no avail.”Another Pulitzer nominee, Omar al-Qattaa, 35, is staying in the remains of his wife’s family’s home after his own apartment was destroyed.“I’m exhausted from carrying heavy cameras on my shoulders and walking long distances,” he said. “We can’t even reach coverage sites because we have no energy left due to hunger and lack of food.”Qattaa relies on painkillers for a back complaint, but said basic medicines were not available in pharmacies, and the lack of vitamins and nutritious food have added to his difficulties.The constant headaches and dizziness he has suffered due to lack of food and water have also afflicted AFP contributor Khadr al-Zanoun, 45, in Gaza City, who said he has even collapsed because of it.“Since the war began, I’ve lost about 30kg (66lbs) and become skeletal compared to how I looked before the war,” he said.“I used to finish news reports and stories quickly. Now I barely manage to complete one report per day due to extreme physical and mental fatigue and near-delirium.”Explore more on these topicsJournalist safetyIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But if not now, then when?” one cabinet minister said.Earlier this month, nearly 60Labour MPs demandedthat the UK immediately recognise Palestine as a state, after Israel’s defence ministerannounced plansto force all residents of Gaza into a camp on the ruins of Rafah.Israel is facing intensifying international condemnation for its actions in Gaza, with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warning that the “last lifelines keeping people alive [in the strip] are collapsing”.Emmanuel Macron, the French president,told British parliamentariansin a visit this month that a two-state solution was “the only way” to build peace and stability in the region. However, diplomats say he has faced resistance from allies such as Britain and Canada over his push.France and Saudi Arabia are co-chairing a rescheduled international conference at the UN in New York later this month to discuss postwar plans forGazaand preparations for formally acknowledging Palestine.The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, whosaid he felt “appalled, sickened”by the scenes of starving Palestinians being shot as they sought food, said the UK would “play its part” in reaching a two-state solution for the Middle East, including working with the French.“We said we wanted that to be part of a process. But we have had no process. What we have had is mayhem and conflict. There has been no process to attach that recognition to,” he told the BBC on Tuesday.“Why do we say that? It’s because we don’t just want to recognise symbolically, we want to recognise as a way of getting to the two states that sadly many are trying to thwart at this point in time.“But there is a live debate and discussion and let me restate again my belief in two states, and two states in which Palestinians have their dignity and freedom and Israel has its security for its people. We will do all we can to achieve that in time.”In an unusual Commons intervention on Gaza, the health secretary,Wes Streeting, on Tuesday called for recognition of the state of Palestine “while there’s still a state of Palestine left to recognise”.He criticised the “intolerable” attack by Israel on the World Health Organization’s staff residence and main warehouse in Deir al-Balah on Monday, which had compromised its operations in Gaza.Cardinal calls Israel’s policy in Gaza ‘morally unjustifiable’ after visitRead more“I deplore Israel’s attacks on healthcare workers as well as other innocent civilians trying to access healthcare or vital aid. These actions go well beyond legitimate self-defence and undermine the prospects for peace,” he told MPs.“I sincerely hope that the international community can come together, as the foreign secretary has been driving towards, to make sure that we see an end of this war but also that we recognise the state of Palestine while there is a state of Palestine left to recognise.”Streeting is understood to be among the cabinet ministers who have pushed for recognition of Palestine in recent cabinet meetings. The justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, and the Northern Ireland secretary, Hilary Benn, are also understood to have brought up the issue.At the Commons liaison committee on Monday, the prime minister said the situation in Gaza was “intolerable” as he repeated the UK’s commitment to recognising a Palestinian state “at a time most conducive to the prospects of peace” in the region.Israel has been fighting Hamas in the Gaza Strip since the Palestinian militant group’s deadly attack on Israel in October 2023. A US-backed proposal for a 60-day ceasefire is being discussed at talks in Doha.Explore more on these topicsGazaKeir StarmerLabourWes StreetingPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaDavid LammynewsShareReuse this content"

There was also [attacks on] the Holy Family and St Porphyrius in the first weeks of the war. And every time it was a mistake.”Israel has issued evacuation orders for the areas surrounding the two compounds where Gaza’s Christians have taken shelter during the war, but the community of about 560 people do not intend to leave.“They know very well that we are determined to remain,” Pizzaballa said when asked whether the Christians would follow the evacuation orders.In the months since his last visit, at the end of last year, destruction of whole neighbourhoods had left parts of Gaza City unrecognisable, Pizzaballa said. Neighbourhoods around the Christian-run al-Ahli hospital, which the clerics visited, were “totally erased”, he said,reduced to rubble.Inside the hospital wards the delegation met doctors and nurses who described patients too malnourished to heal, and met victims of other attacks.Pizzaballa sounded emotional as he described speaking to a father keeping watch at the bedside of his blind, badly injured son, the only survivor of his six children. “It was difficult to bear,” he said of the meeting.Hunger was everywhere, Pizzaballa said, describing long queues of people waiting hours in the sun in hope of something to eat as “a humiliation that is hard to bear when you see it with your own eyes”.Israel authorised church authorities to take 500 tonnes of aid into Gaza after the attack on the Holy Family. The complex logistics meant the food could not cross the border with the delegation, but people are so hungry that news of the planned delivery brought crowds to the church and even members of the congregation had to be shown proof their leaders had come empty-handed.The community is surviving on small rations of mostly bread and rice, and told Pizzaballa that they had not eaten meat, fruit or vegetables since February.He called for an end to the war and said the Christian community saw it as “our moral duty to be part of reconciliation” when peace comes.“After almost two years of war I think everyone starts thinking and arrives at the conclusion that it is about time to stop it.”Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesCatholicismChristianityIsraelIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Also promoted is Neil O’Brien, the former levelling up minister, who will attend shadow cabinet with the brief of policy development.A Tory source said the wider changes “reflect the next stage of the party’s policy renewal programme and underline the unity of the party under new leadership”.A number of shadow ministers have been moved from their roles or demoted. The former health minister Edward Argar has stepped down as shadow health secretary, which he said was on the advice of his doctors after a “health scare” earlier this summer.In his letter to Badenoch, posted on X, Argar said that after a health incident this summer, another issue had been discovered, and that he would step down from his role to focus fully on his health. Badenoch replied saying she was “saddened” at the news.He will be replaced by Stuart Andrew, a former minister who had been shadow culture.Two other shadow ministers have been demoted: the shadow technology secretary, Alan Mak, is sent to the backbenches, replaced by Julia Lopez, and Gareth Bacon, the former shadow transport secretary, will be demoted to shadow London minister.Kevin Hollinrake, who had been the shadow housing and communities secretary, will become the party chair. He takes over from Nigel Huddleston, who will be the new shadow culture secretary.Lee Rowley will be stepping back from his position as chief of staff. After getting Badenoch’s leadership team started, Rowley will be returning to the private sector. Henry Newman will take over as chief of staff, and Lee will support the team transition until the end of October.Francis Maude will join the leader of the opposition’s team as an adviser on a pro-bono basis. He will occasionally attend shadow cabinet and sit on the policy oversight committee.The Tories are on the brink of annihilation in Wales – and it holds a lesson for Westminster politicians | Will HaywardRead moreCleverly, who also served as foreign secretary, had returned to the backbenches afterlosing the leadership contestin the final round of MPs’ votes, meaning Badenoch faced Robert Jenrick in the members’ vote. Jenrick, who is still ambitious for the leadership, hasmaintained a prominent public profileas the shadow justice secretary.In a speech last week, Cleverly warned theConservativesagainst pursuing a populist agenda that would try to ape Nigel Farage’s Reform UK.He also discounted the idea that he hoped to replace Badenoch, saying his party had to “get out of this habit of cycling through leaders in the hope that ditching this one and picking a new one will make life easy for us”.Cleverly had been touted to run as the Tory candidate for mayor of London – and would not be drawn on his future ambitions when he gave the speech last week.

A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence said: “It remains a long-standing UK and Nato policy to neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons at a given location.”One expert, William Alberque, a former director of Nato’s Arms Control, Disarmament and WMD Non-Proliferation Centre, said “the evidence is overwhelming” to conclude that B61 nuclear bombs have been transported to RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk.He cited other specialists who had tracked an unusual C-17 transport flight last week from the US air force base at Kirtland, New Mexico, which hosts a repository of an estimated 2,500 nuclear weapons, to Lakenheath.Taking off on Thursday, the transport plane landed in the UK on Friday and flew with its transponders on, meaning its flight was visible. The flight was operated by the 62nd Airlift Wing, the only US air force unit authorised to transport nuclear weapons.Similar flights also took place last week to air bases in Belgium and the Netherlands, home to long established “nuclear sharing” missions – where American tactical nuclear weapons are stored at European air bases.How and why is Britain obtaining access to nuclear gravity bombs?Read moreThough the UK announced at last month’s Nato summit thatthe RAF would purchase F-35A fighter jets, capable of carrying nuclear weapons, the likely transfer to Lakenheath is thought to have taken place several years before that deal will be completed.Hans Kristensen, nuclear information project director at the Federation of American Scientists, said he believed it was possible a deployment of nuclear weapons had taken place, and would come after a modernisation of the underground storage facilities at the Lakenheath base.The “addition of weapons to Lakenheath would mean the number of US tactical nuclear weapons in Europe has been increased for the first time since the cold war” from approximately 100 bombs “to probably 125-130”, Kristensen said.It would also indicate that “Nato has changed its policy of not responding with new nuclear weapons to Russia’s nuclear threats and behaviour”, he added.The B61-12 is a relatively simple gravity bomb that must be flown and dropped over its target. It comes in four variants, only one of which is more powerful than the 15kt weapon used to bomb Hiroshima in 1945. It has an explosive yield of 50kt, while the others are 0.3kt, 1.5kt and 10kt.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has prompted a remilitarisation in Europe, and Nato allies agreed last month at the Nato summit to lift core defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2035.The weapons are expected to be stored for the US air force 493rd squadron, nicknamed the Grim Reapers, based at Lakenheath. Last week, members of the unit were selling adistinctive commemorative coinat the Royal International Air Tattoo, with a heavyhanded clue that their mission had changed.Photographed by Tony Osborne, a journalist with Aviation Week, the coin comes in the shape of mushroom cloud.

The coin was sold out by the second day of the air show, the journalist added, such was its popularity among those attending the event at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire.Explore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsMilitaryKeir StarmerDefence policynewsShareReuse this content"

He evoked the death ofDr David Kelly, the government weapons expert, who died in 2003 shortly after being revealed as the source for a BBC story stating the government “probably knew” a claim about Iraq’s weapons capabilities was not true.“Could I respectfully suggest that you stop trying to bully the BBC, the nation’s primary public service broadcaster, over its coverage of the war in Gaza,” wrote Kosminsky, who made a docu drama about Kelly’s death in 2005.“The last time Labour was in power, it picked a public fight with the BBC over an editorial matter. It didn’t end well for either party and a man – David Kelly – tragically died.“I have been a Labour supporter for most of my life. It gives me no pleasure to watch this government behaving like a tinpot dictatorship, trying to pressurise a broadcaster for which it holds the purse strings. You are the current custodians of the 100-year tradition of public service broadcasting in this country. This is not the way to discharge that obligation.”View image in fullscreenPeter Kosminsky: ‘It is not the government’s job or responsibility to police the individual editorial decisions of the BBC, or to call for the sacking of its editorial staff.’Photograph: Buchan/Variety/Rex/ShutterstockNandy has repeatedly criticised the BBC over aGaza documentarythat failed to disclose that its child narrator was the son of a Hamas official. She also criticised its livestreaming of the punk rap group Bob Vylan at the Glastonbury festival. Bobby Vylan, whose real name is Pascal Robinson-Foster, was shownleading chantsof “death, death to the IDF”, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.Nandy personally targeted Davie in the House of Commons, warning of “a problem of leadership”. She then gave an interviewquestioning why no one had been fired over the failings.Kosminsky warned Nandy about the historical precedent of political interference, pointing to the Thatcher government’s attempt to pull a 1985 documentary about Northern Ireland.“It is not the government’s job or responsibility to police the individual editorial decisions of the BBC, or to call for the sacking of its editorial staff,” he wrote. “For its part, the BBC must ensure that its output is balanced. But this means balanced across the totality of its output.“As a programme maker with 45 years’ experience of making controversial programmes – for all our public service broadcasters – I know it is impossible to completely balance all arguments within every individual programme. Sometimes it is a programme’s responsibility to ask awkward questions, to raise hackles.”The strength of Nandy’s attacks has been noted by others. Richard Ayre, a former controller of editorial policy and deputy chief executive of BBC News, said last week it was “outrageous that the secretary of state lifts the phone and demands answers from the director general”.“Maybe she’ll start lifting the phone, asking for answers from the editor of individual programmes,” he told the Beeb Watch podcast. “Governance is important. Parliament has put in place governance procedures to govern the BBC independently and fairly – and it shouldn’t be governed by politicians.”Supporters of the BBC are concerned the corporation is running out of allies as it enters crucial talks over the renewal of its charter with the government. After a series of recent crises, Davie said last week he remained the right person to lead the broadcaster.A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson said: “There have been a number of serious failures at the BBC in recent months. The secretary of state has raised these on behalf of licence fee payers who rightly expect action to be taken so that these cannot happen again.“The BBC is operationally and editorially independent of government, and we will always defend this principle. However, there is an important distinction between being independent and being accountable.”Explore more on these topicsBBCLisa NandyIsrael-Gaza warTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.”The statement went on to criticize claims made in an11-page document released last week by Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, who said she was passing evidence of what she claimed was a “treasonous conspiracy” among Obama national security officials to the justice department, recommending their prosecution.“Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes,” it said.“These findings were affirmed in a 2020 report by the bipartisan senate Intelligence Committee, led by then-ChairmanMarco Rubio.”Obama’s response followed a fusillade of accusations by Trump in the White House as he was meeting the president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son of the country’s former autocratic president, who was ousted in a popular “people’s power revolution” in 1986.Asked by a reporter who should be the main target of the criminal investigation recommended in Gabbard’s report, Trump said: “Based on what I read, and I read pretty much what you read, it would be President Obama. He started it, and Biden was there with him. And [James] Comey [the former FBI director] was there, and [James] Clapper [the former director of national intelligence], the whole group was there.“It was them, too, but the leader of the gang was President Obama, Barack Hussein Obama. Have you heard of him?”He went on: “This isn’t like evidence. This is like proof, irrefutable proof that Obama was sedatious [sic], that Obama … was trying to lead a coup, and it was with Hillary Clinton, with all these other people, but Obama headed it up.“He’s guilty. This was treason. This was every word you can think of. They tried to steal the election. They tried to obfuscate the election. They did things that nobody’s ever even imagined.”Trump said Gabbard had told him she had “thousands of additional documents coming”.“It’s the most unbelievable thing I think I’ve ever read. So you want to take a look at that and stop talking about nonsense,” he said, in what appeared to be a coded appeal for supporters to drop their demands for the release of documents related toJeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who was found dead in his prison cell in 2019 as he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges.But the Gabbard report, which accused the Obama administration of forcing spy agencies to alter their conclusions, conflated and misrepresented different issues to discredit the intelligence community’s assessment in 2017 that Russia sought to simultaneously help Trump and damage Clinton.The assessment concluded that Russia did not engage in cyber-attacks against election infrastructure to change vote tallies, but found Moscow hacked and leaked documents from the Democratic National Committee to damage the Clinton campaign.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her reference to ‘deep state officials’ is amateurish, silly, and undercuts the whole damned document.“She’s clever to use crappy precedents and confusion to make her case, but an issue like Russian manipulation of US elections, with so many analysts from diverse organizational cultures, is almost certainly going to leave enough offal on the floor that anyone who wanted to make a one-sided political slam job can find enough to fill an 11-page paper.”Explore more on these topicsBarack ObamaDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the order, signed by Renee Marie Bumb, the chief federal judge for the district ofNew Jersey, appointed Desiree Leigh Grace, a career prosecutor whom Habba had named as her first assistant US attorney, as her replacement.The justice department accused the panel of judges of political motives for declining Habba’s nomination, and, hours later, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, said Grace also had been removed.“This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges – especially when they threaten the President’s core Article II powers,” Bondi wrotein a poston X, referring to Trump’s authority under the US constitution.Grace has been with the US attorney’s office since 2016 and most recently led its criminal division. The appointment was to take effect on Tuesday 22 July, or after the expiration of 120 days following Habba’s interim appointment in March.Democrats condemned the removal of Grace. “The firing of a career public servant, lawfully appointed by the court, is another blatant attempt to intimidate anyone that doesn’t agree with them and undermine judicial independence,” Democratic US senators Cory Booker and Andy Kim from New Jersey said in a joint statement.Habba, 41, had clashed with Booker and Kim. In a statement earlier this month, the senatorssaidHabba had “degraded the office and pursued frivolous and politically-motivated prosecutions”.The senators said Habba “does not meet the standard to serve the people of New Jersey”, and pointed to the arrest of Baraka and her creation of an “Election Integrity Task Force”, which civil rights groups have criticized as an effort to purge some state voter rolls.Habba had been criticized for having no prior prosecutorial experience and politicizing the role. She tolda rightwing talkshow hostshortly after being named to the post: “We could turn New Jersey red. I think New Jersey is absolutely close to getting there, so hopefully while I’m there I can help that cause. And you know, I’m not a political person in that role, but I can tell you that the one thing I just want to do is make [New Jersey] safer.”Habba’s dismissal comes as Democrats in the US Senate recently ended the “blue slip” tradition for circuit court nominees, but kept in place the practice for US attorneys and district court judges. The blue slip system gives a state’s two senators, in this case Booker and Kim, a measure of approval. Without it, a nominee faces confirmation hearings.That has allowed Emil Bove to advance as Trump’s pick for the US court of appeals for the third circuit but allowed federal judges to knock Habba out of the running for New Jersey’s US attorney spot because she had not been confirmed by the Senate judiciary committee.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsNew JerseyTrump administrationUS justice systemUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The company stuck to a previous estimate that trade headwinds threaten to hit the bottom line by $4bn to $5bn. GM said it could take steps to mitigate at least 30% of that impact.The automaker’s revenue in the quarter ending on 30 June fell nearly 2% to about $47bn from a year ago. Shares fell about 3% in premarket trade.Nearly 1 million workers in the US areemployedin the automotive manufacturing industry, with GM thelargestUS auto manufacturer by market share. GM employsabout 162,000people globally.In aletterto shareholders, Mary Barra, the chief executive, said GM was “positioning the business for a profitable, long-term future as we adapt to new trade and tax policies, and a rapidly evolving tech landscape”.GM was among corporations that revised annual guidance due to the impact from Trump’s tariffs, lowering it to an annual adjusted core profit of between $10bn and $12.5bn. The company on Tuesday stood by that forecast.Trump imposed 25% tariffs on foreign-made vehicles and car parts in early April.According to the Yale Budget Lab, Americans now face an average tariff rate of18.7%, the highest since 1933.In June 2025, GMannouncedplans to invest $4bn over the next two years into three US auto plants in Michigan, Kansas and Tennessee, after announcing a $888m investment in a Tonawanda, New York, plant to support GM’s next generation V-8 engine.In the shareholder letter, Barra said the investments will “greatly reduce our tariff exposure” with the new manufacturing capacity to begin coming online in 18 months.The Brookings Institution published areportin May 2025 on the impact of tariffs on US auto manufacturing, noting “the overall impact of higher tariffs on auto manufacturing in the US is unclear, with potential to be net negative”.Beyond tariffs, GM’s underlying business in the quarter was solid. Sales in the US market – its main profit center – rose 7%, while the company continued to command strong pricing on its pickup trucks and SUVs. GM swung back to a small profit in China, after losing money there a year earlier.Jeep-maker Stellantis on Monday warned that tariffs would significantly affect results in the second half of 2025, and said tariffs cost it about $350m.The falls come as US inflation rose in June 2025 to2.7%from 2.4% in May, as companies have raised prices in response to tariff rates implemented by the Trump administration.Reuters contributed to this storyExplore more on these topicsGeneral MotorsTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

To make the US food supply healthier, the Trump administration should focus on less sugar, not different sugar.”Coca-Cola had defended its use of corn syrup – a product some blame for soaring US obesity rates – after Trump claimed on 16 July he had convinced the brand to switch to using sugar cane in its US drinks.“I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so. I’d like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola,” the president said in asocial media post.“This will be a very good move by them – You’ll see. It’s just better!”Coca-Cola said in a statement that “high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) – which we use to sweeten some of our beverages – is actually just a sweetener made from corn. It’s safe; it has about the same number of calories per serving as table sugar and is metabolized in a similar way by your body.”It added that the American Medical Association (AMA) “has confirmed that HFCS is no more likely to contribute to obesity than table sugar or other full-calorie sweeteners”. And it said: “Please be assured that Coca-Cola brand soft drinks do not contain any harmful substances.”In 2023,the AMA released a statementsaying it recognized “that at the present time, insufficient evidence exists to specifically restrict use of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) or other fructose-containing sweeteners in the food supply or to require the use of warning labels on products containing HFCS”.Initially, the drinks giant responded with a neutral statement of appreciation for “president Trump’s enthusiasm” for Coke, and a vague message about “new innovative offerings within ourCoca-Colaproduct range” to come.The soft drinks company released an additional statement making positive claims about high-fructose corn syrup.The Associated Press and Reuters contributedExplore more on these topicsCoca-ColaUnsweetDonald TrumpUS politicsRobert F Kennedy JrnewsShareReuse this content"

Drug companies could be given between 12and 18 months to bring their manufacturing to the US, the president said last month.Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, said Trump’s tariffs were focused on ending reliance on the foreign supply of key pharmaceutical products.“We are proud that AstraZeneca has made the decision to bring substantial pharmaceutical production to our shores. This historic investment is bringing tens of thousands of jobs to the US and will ensure medicine sold in our country is produced right here,” he said.The AstraZeneca chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said the $50bn investment would support the company’s ambition to reach $80bn in revenue by 2030, at which point 50% of sales are expected to come from the US. The company brought in $54.1bn in revenues in 2024.AstraZeneca joins a long list of companies unveiling investments in the US in the face of potentially punitive tariffs.The Swiss drugmaker Roche announced in April that it would put$50bn in US manufacturingover the next five years, in a move it claimed would create more than 12,000 jobs. Its rival Novartis has said it will spend $23bn in the US, and the American pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson said in March that it would invest $55bn in manufacturing and research and development.The Trump administration has already launched an investigation into the pharmaceutical industry, arguing that foreign imports threaten national security, as well as “most favoured nation” pricing.He said in May that the US would “no longer tolerate profiteering and price gouging from big pharma”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Less than 20 minutes later it had sunk.The other fatalities were the vessel’s cook, Recaldo “Rick” Thomas, Lynch’s lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife, Neda, and the chair of Morgan Stanley International bank, Jonathan Bloomer, and his wife, Judy.Nine crew members and six guests – including Lynch’s wife Angela Bacares, whose company owns the Bayesian – were rescued.HPwon a six-year UK civil fraud caseagainst Lynch and his former finance director Sushovan Hussain in 2022, with Mr Justice Hildyard ruling that the US company had been induced into overpaying for Autonomy.On Tuesday, Hildyard issued a ruling at the high court in London on the damages owed to HP from the case. He determined that HP sustained losses of more than £646m in relation to the difference between what it paid for the business and what it would have paid if its true financial position had been known.“Autonomy’s true financial position and performance had not been properly and accurately disclosed, and had it been so, HP would not have proceeded with its acquisition of Autonomy at the bid price,” said Hildyard.Hildyard also said HP was entitled to another £51.7m in relation to “personal claims for deceit and/or misrepresentation against Dr Lynch and Mr Hussain”.However, he said he considered that HP’s original $4.55bn claim “was always exaggerated, and I have concluded that there is more than a grain of truth in Dr Lynch’s submission”.Hildyard addressed Lynch’s death in his ruling, saying the tragedy had caused him to delay his original plan to share a draft of the judgment to the involved parties last September.“No words from me will be of any comfort to his wife and family,” he said in his ruling on Tuesday. “But I wish to express my sorrow at this devastating turn of events, and my sympathy and deepest condolences, having come to know and admire Dr Lynch (notwithstanding my findings against him) over the course of a very long trial.”Lynch had intended to appeal against the high court’s 2022 ruling, a process that was on hold pending Tuesday’s decision on damages.A spokesperson for the Lynch family said they would consider an appeal against the damages ruling, adding that it reflected “that HP’s original $5bn damages claim was not just a wild overstatement – misleading shareholders – but it was off the mark by 80%”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was also ordered to pay financial penalties of about $10m.He started his prison sentence in 2020 but was released early and returned to the UK last year.Last July, Hussain was excluded from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales until 2038, after a decision by the Financial Reporting Council.Mike Lynch obituaryRead moreLast month, theBayesian was raised from the seabedas part of a criminal investigation by Italian authorities that may not conclude until 2027.British maritime investigators also intend to examine the boat as part of a separate investigation into the safety of its design that will feed into inquests in the UK into the deaths of the British nationals onboard.As the sole shareholder of Revtom, the corporate entity that owned the Bayesian, Bacares has been dragged into a multimillion-pound compensation fight between the families of other victims and the insurance company that covered the yacht.Lawyers representing the family of Thomas, whose body was the first to be recovered by divers, have said they will soon press for compensation from Bacares, the crew and Camper & Nicholsons, the management company.British Marine, a subsidiary of the insurance company QBE, covered the Bayesian for more than $150m in liabilities and has instructed its own US law firm.Explore more on these topicsHewlett-PackardTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

The company has emphasised that the scheme does not require survivors to undergo medical assessment and claims can be based on “documentary evidence” without alleged victims having to speak in person about their experiences.In a three-month update, the store announced that survivors who were employed by Fayed’s private airline company Fayair (Jersey) Co Ltd and claim to have suffered abuse before 7 May 2010 – whenAl Fayed sold the business– can now also apply to the scheme.“Since the redress scheme’s inception, more than 100 survivors have entered the process, with many having had eligibility confirmed,” Harrods said. “Compensation awards and interim payments began being issued to eligible survivors at the end of April. Survivors are making use of both the non-medical and medical pathways.”The Metropolitan police said last year that111 women had made allegationsagainst Fayed; the youngest is thought to have been 13 at the time.The Met has apologised to alleged victims of Fayed for the distress they suffered. Complaints against the Met over its handling of allegations will beinvestigated by the force itselfunder the direction of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).The Met is also reviewing 21 allegations that were made before Fayed died in 2023, and referred two of these to the IOPC in November.In documents on the scheme’s website, Harrods “apologises unreservedly” for the sexual abuse people suffered and “wants everyone who is eligible to receive this compensation”.If a person makes a successful application and accepts an offer, it is treated as “full and final settlement”, meaning they waive their right to pursue action for damages.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the UK,Rape Crisisoffers support on 0808 500 2222 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 inScotland, or 0800 0246 991 inNorthern Ireland. In the US,Rainnoffers support on 800-656-4673.

She has denied the allegations and has repeatedly sought without success to have the charges quashed.Dati is accused of accepting €900,000 in lawyer’s fees between 2010 and 2012 from a Netherlands-based subsidiary of Renault-Nissan, but of not really working for it. She was an MEP from 2009 to 2019.Investigations have tried to determine whether she was in fact lobbying in the European parliament for the carmaker, an activity that is forbidden.Dati, a former minister for the rightwing French president Nicolas Sarkozy, was appointed as culture minister last yearin a surprise return to governmentduring Emmanuel Macron’s second term in office.She also serves as the mayor of Paris’s7th arrondissement,where she has been a vocal critic of the city’s Socialist mayor, Anne Hidalgo.Dati became the first Muslim woman to hold a major government post in 2007 when she was appointed justice minister.She has said that growing up on a low-income estate on the outskirts of the town of Chalons-sur-Saône, in Burgundy, gave her a greater understanding than most politicians of the French electorate. In 2007, Sarkozy said appointing Dati sent a message “to all the children ofFrancethat with merit and effort everything becomes possible”.When Dati was appointed to government last year she had already been charged in the Renault-Nissan case. She denied any wrongdoing.The Socialist party leader, Olivier Faure, said at the time of Dati’s appointment that the legal investigation was a problem, saying it sent “a bad signal” and went against Macron’s promises of an “exemplary” republic.Investigating magistrates in France have also ordered thatCarlos Ghosn, the former tycoon of Renault-Nissan, be tried in the case, a judicial source told Agence France-Presse. Ghosn, who has been living in Lebanon for years after escaping arrest in Japan, has also denied the charges against him.A hearing on 29 September will decide on the date of the trial.A source following the case told AFP that the trial could be held after the Paris municipal elections, due in MarchGhosn, the former chair and chief executive of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, was arrested in Japan in November 2018 on suspicion of financial misconduct, before being sacked by Nissan’s board in a unanimous decision.He jumped bail late the following year and made a dramatic escape from Japan hidden in an audio-equipment box, landing in Beirut, where he remains as an international fugitive.Both Japan and France have sought his arrest.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropean UnionEuropeRenaultNissannewsShareReuse this content"

Remember the day. Chloe Kelly may have scored the winner, poking in the rebound from her saved penalty deep into extra time, but it was Michelle Agyemang – whose surname translates literally as “saviour of a nation” – who stepped up when it mattered most, scoring the goal to force that extra time against Italy which began the charge to a third successive final.The banner held up in the small block of Italian fans behind the goal read “football’s coming to Rome” – “home” bruisingly crossed out – and for much of the 90 minutes it looked like it was.England 2-1 Italy: Women’s Euro 2025 semi-final player ratingsRead moreBarbara Bonansea’s first-half goal for Italy had seemingly secured a first final for Andrea Soncin’s side since 1997, but in the final minute of added time England’s 19-year-old wonderkid scored her second critical goal of the tournament to keep their title defence alive before Kelly, the scorer of England’sextra time winner in the 2022 final, delivered again.The Lionesses had escaped group D after a staggeringly bad performance in theiropening game against France, and came from two goals down against Sweden to win on penalties, and in Geneva that battling spirit was on show again, eventually. “The English are never done,” Leah Williamson had said down the camera in 2022 on the way to a first major title, and in 2025 the next generation of super subs stepped up when it mattered most.The 30,000-capacity Stade de Genève did not feel like a fitting place for a semi-final as it is approached. You weave your way through a graffitied industrial jungle and past a scrap‑metal yard towards a stadium with an exterior that is less brutalist beauty and more brutally ugly.It was the fans who provided the colour, though, England supporters sweeping towards the stadium in numbers far greater than those from close neighbours Italy, expectations of a third successive final high.Inside the odd arena, however, the vibe is completely different. It is a paradise, the stands nestled against the pitch with mountains peering over the top as cartoon eyebrow‑like paragliders swept above them.For those hoping for a performance to match the beauty of the surroundings, there would be disappointment. The3-2 penalty victory against Swedenafter they came from two goals to force extra time had been a shambles in the first half, but battling in the second.It was far better from England against Italy in the opening 45 minutes. Wiegman had made one change for the three-hour trip west of Zurich and it was a characteristically pragmatic one.View image in fullscreenBarbara Bonansea scores the opening goal for Italy to stun the Lionesses.Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw/ReutersJess Carter, who so bravely spoke out on Sundayagainst the racist abuseshe has suffered during the tournament, was dropped in favour of Esme Morgan and England generally looked a more settled side. Italy maybe eight places below the Lionesses in the Fifa world rankings, but they had scored first in every game in Switzerland.They are a well-organised unit, a team that have really gone up a gear and grown as a collective as they have progressed to their first semi‑final since 1997.It had been an even opening half-hour, Wiegman’s side edging things possession wise but Italy were prepared for that, perhaps seeing more of the ball than they had expected.It was Sofia Cantore, who masterminded the goal to give them another lead, the Washington Spirit-bound forward beating Alex Greenwood to the byline and putting the ball into the middle where it grazed the thigh of Lucy Bronze before falling to Bonansea, who took a touch before smashing the ball into the roof of the net from a tight angle.The celebrations were wild, almost the entire Italy starting XI bundling together with their substitutes in the England dugout just to rub salt in the wound. England had chances, but they did not take them in the opening 45 minutes, Alessia Russo putting an effort wide and Lauren James twice forced saves from Laura Giuliani, neither having quite enough power behind them. James was withdrawn in favour of Beth Mead at the start of the second half, the Chelsea forward worryingly seen with ice on her foot.The Italians were dealt a big blow around the hour when the tearful talismanic captain, Cristiana Girelli, exited seemingly with a hamstring issue, to be replaced by Martina Piemonte. It was frenetic as England sought the equaliser.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang (left) scores her late equaliser to force extra time.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/EPAThe change many were begging for came very late on, Kelly thrust on in place of Georgia Stanway with 13 minutes of normal time remaining in the semi-final. Bronze had a header cleared off the line and Hannah Hampton made a double save to keep England in it.The final roll of the dice came with five minutes left, Russo and Leah Williamson departing in place of Agyemang and Aggie Beever-Jones as England went for an all-out attack.The gamble paid off, Agyemang the hero, firing in with a minute of added time remaining to secure another 30 minutes of football. That half‑hour was torturous, England’s new-look XI, in its slapdash shape, desperately sought the winner.Agyemang went closest, her clipped effort coming back off the bar before Emma Severini’s challenge on Beth Mead earned the holders a penalty. Giuliani saved Kelly’s spot‑kick, but she was first to the loose ball and poked it in to set up a final against either Germany or Spain.

Paret-Peintre’s impressive victory came at the expense of the indefatigable Ben Healy, who was within a hair’s breadth of taking his second stage win of the Tour.Tour de France 2025: Valentin Paret-Peintre conquers Mont Ventoux to win stage 16 – as it happenedRead moreIt was Paret-Peintre’s second Grand Tour win, after his stage victory in the 2024 Giro. “This morning I didn’t think this was possible, because I expected [Tadej] Pogacar to want to win,” he said.Yet the absence of his Soudal Quick-Step team leader, Remco Evenepoel, who abandoned the Tour in the Pyrenees, opened a door of opportunity for the climber from the Haute-Savoie. “I could see that I wasn’t strong enough to drop Healy in the finale,” he said, of his team’s fourth stage win in this year’s race, “so I focused on trying to beat him in the sprint.”But while Healy and Paret-Peintre were playing out the final moments of a sparring match that had started much further down the mountain,Jonas Vingegaardwas keeping his promise to attack the race leader Pogacar.Just 48 hours after Vingegaard’s Visma-Lease a Bike team had been lambasted for their lack of cohesion andaccused of disloyaltytowards the two-time champion by some critics, they were transformed into a cohesive well-drilled unit, working hard to support his efforts to dislodge Pogacar.View image in fullscreenValentin Paret-Peintre crosses the finish line ahead of Ben Healy on top of Mont Ventoux to win stage 16 of the Tour de France.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/APSepp Kuss, Wout van Aert and Tiesj Benoot put in lengthy turns pacemaking their leader on the never-ending climb, in the hope of finally cracking Pogacar. “The team did really amazing today,” Vingegaard said. “Everybody worked, there was real commitment from everyone.”But the Dane’s best efforts, which saw him make several attacks on his rival, came to nothing. On the Ventoux’s cruel final bend, perhaps the worst on the climb, the Slovenian again opened up a gap, sneaking clear to increase his overall lead by another couple of seconds.“He followed me every time he attacked and I followed him,” Vingegaard said after the stage. “I don’t know if I could see any weaknesses today but at least, how good I felt gives me motivation. I will keep trying.“I was feeling very good, so I’m happy. I didn’t get any time, but I take a lot of motivation from it.”Yet insult was added to injury when Vingegaard collided with a photographer on the Ventoux summit’s cramped finish line. “A photographer stepped right in front of me,” he said. “I don’t know what he was doing. I went down. People who are working on the finish line need to be more careful.”However hard he tries, he cannot find any weaknesses in Pogacar’s armour. Vingegaard’s first attacks, in the forested section of the climb, splintered the main peloton and took him across to his teammate Benoot.For a fleeting moment and for perhaps the first time in this Tour, Pogacar initially showed signs of stress. At Chalet Reynard however, 6km from the top, the pair were still inseparable, although Vingegaard had one more card to play.View image in fullscreenTadej Pogacar follows Jonas Vingegaard up Ventoux before going clear in the final metres.Photograph: Papon Bernard/ReutersAs they bridged up to another of his teammates, Victor Campenaerts, he had another ally to pace him into the decisive kilometres. But the Dane’s next move, with 4km to race, once more failed to dislodge the race leader.The pair’s blistering times on Ventoux shattered all precedents. The past record, set by Spain’s Iban Mayo in a 2004 time trial, was 55 minutes and 51 seconds. Pogacar beat that mark by a minute and 20 seconds, with Vingegaard just two seconds slower.Afterwards Pogacar, asked what his limits were, appeared offended by the question. “I don’t think we could ride much faster,” he said. “Jonas and his team did very good pacing. On our aero bikes we go pretty fast, maybe we pick up a couple of seconds. I don’t know. What do you want?”He maintained too that, despite appearances, he was no Superman. “I’m definitely not Superman. I was born in Ljubljana. Today was an epic climb to do and we brought down the gap quite fast. We saw the winners in the last 800 metres, but even for Superman I don’t think it would have been possible to catch them.”There were some other shifts in the overall standings, although Kelso’s Oscar Onley clung on and remains stubbornly in fourth place overall, after finishing 14th on the stage. But Primoz Roglic, ninth on the Ventoux, is moving up the standings and has now climbed into the top five, while the unflagging Healy remains in the Tour’s top 10, in ninth place overall.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarJonas VingegaardTour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

Our correspondent in the desert empties her notebookClaire de Lunein Las VegasTue 22 Jul 2025 08.26 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Jul 2025 12.18 EDTShare1) Portland may be geniusesThe Portland Trail Blazers were the butt of every draft night joke when they took China’s 7ft 1in Yang Hansen, who had been widely projected as a second-round pick, at No 16 overall. But it appears the joke may be on the rest of the NBA, at least if Vegas Summer League is any indication. Hansen was unequivocally the story of the week, impressing with his high-level offensive skillset, and, in particular, his aptitude for passing and facilitation, an unusual trait for someone his size that has garnered him comparisons to one Nikola Jokić. Despite a ton of attention from global media (Hansen is already getting massive amounts of press back home in China), the jovial 20-year-old appears to have a good head on his shoulders, too. Hetold Ben Golliver of the Washington Postthis week: “There’s a saying in my heart, don’t worry about anything that’s more than eight hours away. And even if it’s within eight hours, don’t worry too much.”2) Cooper Flagg is as good as advertisedHeading into a scalding hot week in the desert, the talk of the town was a teenager from Maine, and he proved his mettle in his two Summer League appearances. There was an astronomical amount of hype around the No 1 overall pick leading into his Dallas Mavericks debut, and while the shots didn’t start falling until his second game, all the signs of someone who will almost certainly be a highly impactful NBA player were there from tip-off. Flagg is incredibly well-rounded: he can create, score, pass and defend at a high level, and heshowcased a little bit of everythingin Vegas. Posting 31 points and four rebounds in his second (and final) Summer League appearance against the San Antonio Spurs, Flagg showed why many scouts have called him the most promising college prospect since Zion Williamson. And with Flagg’s reported maniacal work ethic, his career is primed to easily clear his fellow Duke alum’s.Cooper Flagg’s NBA soft launch showed the spotlight fits just fineRead more3) Bronny James is an NBA playerIt’s been a rollercoaster start to his NBA career for Bronny James, who saw his brief college basketball tenure at the University of Southern Californiainterrupted by a cardiac arrestand then faced more criticism than perhaps any late second-round draft pick in league history. It even brought abouta feudbetween LeBron James and Stephen A Smith, when the ESPN blowhard scolded Bronny’s father on television for, he purported, forcing his son into a spotlight for which he was woefully unqualified (“I’m pleading with you, as a father, stop this,” Smith said). Bronny didn’t have a particularly impressive first season in the league, to be sure. But between his time in the G League last year and his stint for the Lakers in Vegas this year, one thing is becoming clear: he has upside as an NBA role player. For much of the week, James Jr was the Lakers’ standout player, flashing impressive playmaking and athleticism that recalled his days as a highly touted high school recruit before his myocardial infarction. Perhaps Mr Smith spoke too soon.View image in fullscreenDylan Harper could be an outside contender for rookie of the year honors.Photograph: David Becker/AP4) San Antonio have an embarrassment of riches at guardFlagg is obviously the frontrunner to win Rookie of the Year this season, but there is a non-zero chance that a San Antonio Spur could take the award for the third year running, which is pretty damned remarkable. Dylan Harper, the Rutgers guard who the Spurs drafted second overall, showcased why San Antonio have a chance at a ROTY three-peat. Harper missed the beginning of Summer League with a groin injury, but in his marquee match-up against Flagg, he showcased the defensive intensity and point of attack chops that make the guard such an intriguing prospect. At 6ft 5in, he has great size for his position, and his finishing around the basket is already impressive.5) Denver are sitting prettyJust a year ago, Ipredictedthat the Denver Nuggets – NBA champions only a few seasons ago and home to Jokić, widely regarded as the best player in the world – were on the brink of a disastrous season. After all, not only had they let yet another key component of their championship core (Kentavious Caldwell-Pope) walk out the door for nothing, but the floor spacing big man, DaRon Holmes II, who they’d drafted just a few weeks earlier to be Jokić’s backup, suffered a harrowing achilles tear in his Summer League debut and was out indefinitely. What a difference a year can make: Denver were able tomake some shrewd free-agency movesand convince Jonas Valanciunasnot to abandon ship for Europe. And a year after his devastating lower leg injury, Holmes hasn’t just picked up where he left off, he may have exceeded expectations, grabbing a staggering 17 rebounds and adding 19 points in his final game in Vegas.6) Keep an eye on the HornetsNo team can be the laughing stock of the league forever, but the Charlotte Hornets have held the distinction for about as long as humanly possible. But their status seems primed to change, and not just because the franchise won its first ever Summer League Championship last weekend (or championship of any kind, for that matter). Under new,Jumpman-less ownership, the Hornets finally seem to have a direction: hiring super smart and beloved head coach Charles Lee, appearing to nail the draft pick of forward Brandon Miller a couple of years back, and having a pretty stellar draft this year as well. They scooped up UConn’s Liam McNeeley, who was one of the biggest Vegas standouts, alongside Duke’s Kon Knueppel, who got some shine of his own when his clutch play netted him Summer League championship game MVP honors. Knueppel was in Flagg’s shadow for most of his one-and-done season at Duke, but he’s cerebral, skilled and a crafty scorer, and should be immediately impactful for the Hornets. Suddenly, things don’t look so bleak in North Carolina.Explore more on these topicsNBAPortland Trail BlazersDallas MavericksCooper FlaggLos Angeles LakersSan Antonio SpursDenver NuggetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To the tournament and to my fans in Canada I am very sorry, I will see you next year!”‘Knee cooked’: Nick Kyrgios limps along road to recovery in return from injuryRead moreDraper revealed on Xthat he would also miss the Cincinnati Open starting 5 August. The British No 1 wrote: “After Wimbledon I picked up an injury in my left arm, nothing serious, but I have to make sure it recovers fully for the rest of the season. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to compete in Toronto and Cincinnati … see you in NYC!”Sinner is looks to protect his elbow, after a tumble in his fourth-round match against Grigor Dmitrov at Wimbledon. Djokovic also suffered niggling injuries throughout his run at the tournament, with a groin problem ultimately being the main reason he will be absent from Toronto.Alexander Zverev, the world No 3, and Taylor Fritz, ranked No 4, are likely to be the top seeds in Toronto.Many players have spoken out against the scheduling on both the men’s Association ofTennisProfessionals (ATP) and the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) tours. In March the Professional Tennis Players’ Association (PTPA), which was co-founded by Djokovic, began legal action against tennis’s governing bodies in the US, the UK and EU, in what it described as being “on behalf of the entire player population”.On 26 June the PTPA submitted an amended complaint, dropping the International Tennis Federation, which runs team events and the Olympic events, and the International Tennis Integrity Agency from the lawsuit, focusing solely on the ATP and WTA tours, despite the PTPA actively negotiating with all four grand slam tournaments.Meanwhile the Australian Nick Kyrgios came through his first match since March, and just his sixth this year, alongside the French veteran Gaël Monfils in the men’s doubles at the DC Open.They lost 2-6, 2-6to Édouard Roger-Vasselin and Hugo Nys.Explore more on these topicsTennisCarlos AlcaraznewsShareReuse this content"

In the moment, it didn’t matter to him that he’d gotten there thanks to a call of catcher’s interference.“To be honest, this feels exactly like a home run,” Sosa said. “The most important thing about it is that we end up winning the game, and that’s what we went out to do.”Sosa clinched the game when, with the bases loaded and no out in the 10th inning, his check swing on a 2-2 pitch struck the glove of Red Sox catcher Carlos Narvaez. The Phillies dugout called for a review, which showed there was contact, allowing Sosa to take first and Brandon Marsh to score the winning run.“I felt my barrel was a little late on the pitch,” said Sosa, who entered as a pinch-hitter in the eighth and singled. “And as I go through my swing path, I feel like I hit the catcher’s glove. And I told the ump that I think I felt something, and I started signaling [to] the dugout.”It’s the first instance of a walk-off catcher’s interference in a major league game since 1971, when the Los Angeles Dodgers won on a call against Cincinnati Reds catcher Johnny Bench. Willie Crawford was the batter, Joe Gibbon the pitcher.Monday’s play went down as an error for Narvaez, his sixth of the season, the second-most among catchers in the majors. Narvaez also had a passed ball, his fifth, in the fourth inning that moved Nick Castellanos into scoring position after he drove in the Phillies’ first run. Castellanos scored on JT Realmuto’s single.“I don’t feel I was that close to the hitter,” Narvaez said. “Everything went so quick. Really tough for that to happen in that moment to cost us the game. I take accountability. I’ve got to be better. That cannot happen.”The Phillies have been on the other end of a quirky walk-off this season:they lost in San Francisco on 8 Julywhen Patrick Bailey hit a three-run, inside-the-park home run.“There’s two things this year that I’ve never seen before in 40 years,” Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. “One is a walk-off inside-the-park home run, and one is a walk-off catcher’s interference.”The Phillies won without putting a ball in play in the 10th. Marsh started the inning at second base. Otto Kemp, trying to bunt him to third, was walked by Boston reliever Jordan Hicks.Hicks’ first delivery to Max Kepler was a wild pitch that moved the runners to second and third. The Red Sox intentionally walked Kepler. Sosa went down 0-2, fouled a pitch off, then offered at an 86 mph slider, hitting only the thumb of Narvaez’s glove to decide the game.“It’s strange,” Phillies starting pitcher Zack Wheeler said. “People always say, I’ve never seen that before on a baseball field. It’s just another one. I’m wondering how many more times you can say that.”Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia PhilliesBoston Red SoxMLBBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the fourth minute of injury time in the Euro 2025 semi-final. Every England player bar Chloe Kelly is within 20 yards of Italy’s goal. And as blisteringly underwhelming as England have been all night, this is still a team with an unerring sense of their own narrative, a belief in themselves, a taste for the dramatic climax.The noise builds to a roar. The roar builds to a scream. Kelly puts her corner straight into the side netting. Hampton hangs her head and gallops back into more familiar territory. End of the road. England are done.Kelly and Agyemang fire England into Euro 2025 final after comeback against ItalyRead moreOf course there had been the usual gripes about Italian gamesmanship, the eternity Laura Giuliani was taking over goal kicks, the constant injury breaks, the sudden random attacks of cramp.The real timewasters here, though, were not Italy but England, who on a shapeless and lawless night in Geneva conspired to waste a nation’s entire evening, before finally doing the thing they were paid to do.Sarina Wiegman had wasted 76 minutes of this game tinkering around the edges of an approach that was patently not working. Once again she had treated her substitutions as if she were paying for them out of her own pocket. Kelly, one of England’s brightest players of the tournament, had spent the night doing sprints up the touchline in a bib. Michelle Agyemang was once a Wembley ball girl, and here she was again: marooned on the sidelines, a peripheral figure, waiting to be called briefly into action.At the start of the second half England’s players had gathered in a huddle, presumably in order to learn each other’s names and positions. Hi, I’m Alex, left-back. Hi, I’m Ella, attacking midfield. Lauren, left wing, how you doing? And if the heist against Sweden had a kind of stirring Blitz spirit to it, tones and shades, a clear sense of purpose, here England were simply pointless, one-dimensional, lacking in craft or identity or even the most basic idea of how they wanted to play.View image in fullscreenEngland enjoyed plenty of fortune as they edged through to the final at Italy’s expense.Photograph: Sébastien Bozon/AFP/Getty ImagesAt which point, you might point out – not unreasonably – that England won. And fair enough. Agyemang at the death, Kelly’s penalty rebound, the surge of endorphins, the fans in the stands reeling to Sweet Caroline: great moments, brilliant memories. Proof of the spirit and guts and resilience, and all that. And rinse, and repeat. The final on Sunday against Germany or Spain will be another occasion of national significance, another milestone for the growing women’s game.And so you might say the end justified the means, if in fact it were possible to identify any means. Against a team far inferior to Sweden, flagging and flailing, deprived of their best player through injury and offering pretty much nothing between the 35th and the 85th minutes, England had nothing to offer but slow-cooked panic. It was a vindication of nothing, an indication of nothing but the ability of a deeper, more talented squad to bungle a result through blind luck.Michelle AgyemangNone of this felt like the result of a calculated masterplan, or even a stronger mentality. Italy defended magnificently all game and but for a fumble by Giuliani and a slightly naive challenge by Emma Severini would have enjoyed the greatest night in their history. Even the winning goal owed itself to dumb fortune: Kelly’s penalty was so straight that there was barely any angle for Giuliani to push it to the side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For a nation as integral to the game’s development and history as England, that loves this sport as much as England, this side’s inability to express itself through its football is going to be the sort of thing that holds future teams back. How should England look and feel? What are its basic principles of play? How should we as a public identify with them, beyond a shirt and an empty nationalism and some vaguely lifestyle-themed content?Win or lose on Sunday, this generation of great England footballers has had its time. The future is Agyemang and Aggie Beever-Jones, Grace Clinton and Maya Le Tissier, and arguably the present should be too. Perhaps we are discovering the limits of Wiegman’s staunch loyalty to her class of 2022, her stubborn persistence with players and patterns that have long since been decrypted by the rest of Europe.The final whistle blows and after the celebrations subside, England’s players decide to link hands and run towards their supporters. Even here there is a kind of incoherence to them, everyone running at different speeds, everyone seeing the move at different times.And of course there is still one game to go. One more chance to make an impression. One more chance to produce a level of football we have not seen from England yet at this tournament, arguably not really seen from this side for a couple of years. England have cheated death twice. They will not be allowed to do so again.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamItaly women's football teamWomen's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Professional Footballers’ Association is also understood to be supporting England’s players.Premier League teams have been taking the knee before matches for five years since the Black Lives Matter movement came to global prominence after the murder in the US of George Floyd. The pre-match gesture was introduced after a request from the players and was first seen in England when Aston Villa and Sheffield United met in June 2020 in the first Premier League game back after the cessation of live sport because of the Covid-19 pandemic.England’s men’s and women’s international teams, as well as EFL clubs, followed the Premier League in adopting the practice although most of those sides have since dropped it. Taking the knee was scaled back in the Premier League last season and only took place before the first and last league games of the season, as well as before dedicated No Room For Racism fixtures staged in October and April.While Kick It Out and the PFA appear ambivalent over the value of the gesture Fare insists that it remains a powerful symbol and argues it is particularly important in the Premier League, where more than a third of the players are black.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It blocked proposed deals with Etihad Airways and First Abu Dhabi Bank in 2023, sparking an acrimonious legal battle that remains ongoing.In a significant victory for the club, an independent panel ruled in February that the Premier League’s associated party transaction (APT) rules in operation at that time were “void and unenforceable”. Cityhave since launcheda legal challenge against amended APT regulations voted through by 16 clubs last November. Another independent panel is expected to rule on that matter later this year, with City reserving the right to sue the Premier League, depending on the outcome.The kit deal with Puma could prove an extremely useful weapon in City’s armoury, as well as opening the door to other lucrative contracts, which has not gone unnoticed at other clubs.“This is a huge deal for City, in terms of what it says about the size of the club and their ability to attract independent sponsors,” a senior executive at another club told the Guardian. “City have submitted two legal challenges to the Premier League’s APT rules after having two sponsorship deals blocked. But maybe those deals weren’t overvalued after all?”The reported value of the Puma deal has attracted some scepticism because, at £100m a year, it is a huge rise on City’s existing £65m-a-year Puma contract. The increase does not reflect City’s recent merchandising sales which, according to figures collated by Uefa, brought in £69m last year, just over half the revenue generated by Manchester United and Liverpool, and far behind the world leaders, Real Madrid, whose merchandising income was £170m.City’s ability to generate more than the £90m and £60m annual payments United and Liverpool will receive from Adidas next season has been widely questioned given their north-west rivals have larger global fanbases, but independent experts are adamant that Puma would not overpay.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola’s achievements have transformed Manchester City’s global profile.Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters“Puma’s strategy is based upon having a smaller number of iconic clubs soManchester Cityfits this profile,” Ricardo Fort, a former head of sponsorship at Coca-Cola and Visa who now runs his own consultancy firm, told the Guardian. “They also have kit deals with other clubs in the City Football Group, including Palermo and Melbourne, but City will be their priority.“Puma are very disciplined about what they will pay for sponsorship deals so will not have overpaid, or at least not by more than they had to. They are very rigorous.”Puma’s relationship with City goes back to 2019, when they signed a group-wide deal that also covered Melbourne City, Girona FC, Club Atlético Torque and Sichuan Jiuniu FC. Despite this Puma had to beat off rival offers from Adidas and Nike to agree an extension, which may also go some way towards explaining its value.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionCity’s income and global profile have also increased significantly since 2019 on the back of the extraordinary achievements of Pep Guardiola’s side, who have won 14 major trophies, including four Premier League titles in a row, and in 2023 became the second English team to claim the treble.In their annual report published last December, City announced a Premier League record revenue of £715m for the 2023-24 season, with commercial income accounting for £344.7m. Over the past five years City’s revenue has grown by 50%, an increase which broadly tallies with the value of the Puma contract.For branding expert Marcel Knobil of BrandGuru, the partnership makes sense. “Brands want to be associated with success and Manchester City can boast a record that no other club has achieved,” he said.“The club also has an extremely wealthy owner behind it, which will also provide some future-assurance for Puma. Kit sponsors want teams to be both successful and packed with stars – and only deep pockets can secure the latter.”Puma’s renewed commitment is also a confidence boost for City while they await the verdict of the Premier League’s 130-plus charges related toalleged breaches of financial fair play rules. Numerous industry sources told the Guardian that the contract would almost certainly include so-called “bad faith clauses” enabling Puma to terminate if the club are found guilty of serious wrongdoing.City declined to comment. The club have denied the charges, so do not consider early termination to be a possibility.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityFinancesBusinessexplainersShareReuse this content"

Whatever they’re smoking in Boston is having an unusual effect on a global fanbase.Big-spending Liverpool, blowing competitors from Bayern Munich to Newcastle out of the water with their pulling and spending power, may be a strange reality for supporters who not so long ago sang: “The Reds have got no money, but we’ll still win the league.” The chant can be retired now that the first part is demonstrably untrue. It always was.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreWhenHugo Ekitiké completes his move from Eintracht Frankfurt, for a deal that Liverpool would be delighted to reach £79m because it would represent further success at club and individual level, the champions will have made two of the three biggest signings in their history in the space of five weeks. Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s Boston-based owner, would have been prepared to break the club’s transfer record twice in that timeframe but for Newcastle’s insistence that Alexander Isak is not for sale.It appears a radical departure by FSG to build so ambitiously from a position of strength, while sending an ominous warning to Premier League rivals with designs on closing the gap. But Liverpool maintain there has been no change in strategy and that the club continue to be run along self-sustaining lines. The approach that enabled them to transform Jürgen Klopp’s team in 2018 by buying Alisson and Virgil van Dijk with the proceeds of Philippe Coutinho’s £142m sale to Barcelona has also shaped plans for sustained success under Arne Slot. The benefits of thinking long term have paid off. No profitability and sustainability issues here.The answer to how Liverpool have been able to spend heavily this summer is dull, out of step with many clubs throughout the English football pyramid and anathema to those besotted with winning the transfer window over genuine prizes: financial discipline.Liverpool last spent big in the summer of 2023 when rebuilding Klopp’s midfield to the tune of £145m while recouping £52m from the sales of Fabinho and Jordan Henderson to the Saudi Pro League. Not a penny was spent in the January transfer windows of 2024 and 2025, and last summer, Slot’s first in charge, brought an outlay of only £10m for Federico Chiesa, the amount received from Salzburg for Bobby Clark. Liverpool made a profit of £42.5m last summer with the sales of Fábio Carvalho and Sepp van den Berg to Brentford (if taking the initial £25m for Valencia’s goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili – agreed 12 months ago – into this year’s expenditure). The club’s faith in the rebuilding work of 2023 explained their reticence to re-enter the market in three successive windows, and was vindicated withtitle No 20 in April.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s spending this summer may not have finished as they remain keen on Crystal Palace central defender Marc Guéhi.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAThe importance of Champions League qualification to Liverpool’s financial health was evident in their last set of published accounts, for the year to 31 May 2024, which showed a £57m loss mainly as a consequence of missing out that year and competing in the Europa League. Revenue for this year is projected to pass £700m for the first time with the club making more than £80m from the return to the Champions League and about £180m from the triumphant Premier League campaign. Matchday and commercial revenue will have increased as Liverpool continue to benefit from the redevelopments of the Main Stand and Anfield Road Stand.This summer’s transfer business – with Ekitiké soon to join the record signing Florian Wirtz, Mamardashvili, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez, the young Hungarian goalkeeping prospect Armin Pecsi and goalkeeping cover Freddie Woodman – leaves the champions looking stronger on paper before their title defence. Any predictions for Liverpool this season, of course, must be tempered by the unknown and unimaginable factor of a team dealing with the tragic death of one of their own in Diogo Jota.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Slot tended to stick with a trusted core of players in the Premier League last season. There is no disputing the methods of a coach who wins the title in his debut season at Liverpool with ease and four matches to spare, although Slot himself suspected fatigue played a part in theCarabao Cup final defeat by Newcastle.Ekitiké, a France Under-21 international who scored 22 goals in his one and only season at Eintracht, may not be Liverpool’s final signing of a statement summer. The Premier League champions remain keen on Crystal Palace’s central defender Marc Guéhi and there would be appetite for another forward should Bayern eventually succeed in their pursuit of Luis Díaz.Liverpool maintain Díaz is not for sale and that their €100m (£86.8m) valuation of the Colombia international is for accounting purposes rather than an asking price. That may be so but if that valuation is met and Díaz departs, and Liverpool get what they want for Darwin Núñez (£55m), Harvey Elliott (£40m-plus), Chiesa (£10m) and Tyler Morton (£15m), the club could yet recoup more than £200m before the transfer window closes on 1 September.

Love you Sir Joey RIP. My condolences are with Janice and all the family.”Jones’s contribution to Liverpool was immortalised in the “Joey ate the frogs legs, made the Swiss roll, now he’s munching Gladbach” banner revealed by fans at the 1977 European Cup final victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach. The banner was in reference to victories over Saint-Étienne and FC Zürich in the quarter- and semi-finals.“I guarantee the Germans would have known every player in our team apart from me – just one of the lads who has come off the Kop,” he said of the banner, which after 20 years in his garage is now in Liverpool’s museum. “I guess that’s why the fans identified with me because I’d give it my all and I was one of them. I never considered myself to be skilful but I was the type of player I think any team needs. I think as much of that banner as I do the winner’s medal.”With Wrexham, Jones won the Welsh Cup and helped the club reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 1974. He had a brief spell as caretaker manager and remained a fixture at the Racecourse Ground even after his retirement: following heart surgery in 2002 and a minor stroke in 2015, he returned as youth-team ambassador in 2021.View image in fullscreenJoey Jones (centre) on the touchline during his post-playing career at Wrexham.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianA post from the club on X read: “Wrexham AFC are devastated to learn of the passing of Club legend Joey Jones. A true Club legend, on and off the pitch, with time for everybody he met, Joey will be greatly missed by all who knew him.”A statement on the Football Association of Wales (FAW) website described Jones as “an iconic figure who defined a generation for the fans of Liverpool, Wrexham and Cymru”. It continued: “Despite his humble nature off the field, Jones will go down in history as one of the best defenders of his generation for what he achieved with Liverpool, but it was his dedication to the game, his no-nonsense style and his genuine love for the clubs that he represented that will forever endear him to the fans, and how they appreciated that he was so much like them with his desire just to play football.”There were also tributes on X from the former Liverpool stars Jamie Carragher and John Aldridge and the FAW’s chief executive, Noel Mooney. Aldridge wrote: “What a lovely man and an inspirational full back who gave his heart and soul in a red shirt and for all the clubs he played for! Our thoughts are with Joey’s family! I’m a lucky man to have met him many times.”Explore more on these topicsFootballLiverpoolWalesWrexhamnewsShareReuse this content"

But the picture from the 2025 Copa América Feminina, played in the South American winter, is less rosy with criticism from players, coaches, fans and media regarding the poor organisation, low attendances and questionable refereeing.With thefiasco of the Copa Libertadores Feminina last October, another tournament blighted by organisational problems, fresh in memory the hope was that Conmebol would raise their game for this year’s Copa América in Ecuador. However, the tournament feels years behind its European rival and that is worrying in the extreme as the continent prepares to host its first Women’s World Cup, in Brazil in 2027.The issues at the tournament reflect deeper structural problems within South American women’s football. Major competitions often lack the technology now ever-present in the men’s game, such as VAR from the group stage, and the main stadiums in the country are not being used.Promotion for this competition has also been lacking, with tickets, for example, only going on sale on 4 July, just eight days before the tournament started. It is no surprise that there has been a low turnout. Brazilian legend Marta was one of those who spoke out about the limited investment in the tournament. “It’s been a long time since I played in a tournament here in South America, and we were saddened by these circumstances. We hope that Conmebol will change things and improve the situation,” she told Globo Esporte.View image in fullscreenBrazil training indoors prior to a Copa América Femenina match.Photograph: XUndeterred and while under fire for its handling of the Copa América, Conmebol announced a new international tournament: the Nations League. The draw will take place on 31 July in Paraguay and will run between 2025 and 2026. Two places at the World Cup are up for grabs, with another two available at the intercontinental playoffs. At least VAR will be used at all the games.That has not been the case in Ecuador, where the Chilean defender Fernanda Pinilla spoke up against the lack of it for the group stages. It will only be used in this week’s semi-finals and the final. “I think VAR can work for you or against you, but it gets us closer to fairness,” she said after the 2-1 defeat to Argentina. “It would be really important that, in such a major tournament like the Copa América, it could be used. We still need to improve the tournament, the format, everything, and one of these improvements would be to have VAR from the group stage.”Pinilla was not the only one to criticise the tournament’s organisation. Her teammate Yanara Aedo said: “It’s disrespectful that we don’t have VAR. For us, as players, it’s shameful to watch the [differences between] the Euros and the Copa América … In our last match [a 3-0 win over Peru], a legitimate goal was disallowed. It’s good that the game was broadcast so people could see the two penalties we weren’t given. I’m not saying Argentina didn’t deserve to win but VAR would have changed the game for them and us, for every player. The organisers should get their act together because we’re as much footballers as the men are.”Another heavily criticised issue was the warm-up arrangements before matches. Players were not allowed to warm up on the pitch; instead they had to get ready in small rooms in the stadium. “While at the Euros they are breaking records in technology, we are warming up in a room with a maximum of 20 square metres, smelling of paint,” wrote the Brazilian and Manchester City forward Kerolin on her X account after scoring a hat-trick in the 6-0 win against Bolivia.The Brazilian women’s national team, who have won the tournament nine times, have been at the forefront of the criticism over Conmebol’s handling of the competition. They had to warm up in these small rooms before the games against Venezuela and Bolivia –together with their opponents.“The warm-up issue really worries me,” the Brazil coach, Arthur Elias, said. “We had a player who, at the end of the warm-up, felt what was maybe a muscle issue. We tested her [and she played], but if we had needed to replace her it would have been with a player who hadn’t warmed up because there wasn’t enough space for all 20 players.”Conmebol claimed that, with all matches being played in just two stadiums, the pitches would deteriorate if the warm-ups were done on them too. However, the governing body later announced that, after re-evaluating the condition of the pitches, players would be allowed 15 minutes of warm-up on the playing field. “I’d like to thank Conmebol for being conscious enough to allow us to warm up for 15 minutes. It’ll be really important. It’s still not ideal, not even close, but it’s a good first step, and may we always evolve,” Kerolin said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Peter Beardsley’s performances in 2002 for Newcastle United were legendary, Jörg Albertz helped himself to a few more thunderb@stards for Rangers and how can we forget the vastly underrated Owen Coyle squealing “Coyle!” every time he took a shot. As they disappeared from our screens, charity fundraisers came to the fore. In Soccer Aid, Woody Harrelson being mobbed by Zinedine Zidane and Jens Lehmann after burying the winning penalty past England keeper Jamie Theakston for the Rest of the World XI was memorable, as wasa certain tackleby future UK prime minister Boris Johnson on former Manchester City cult hero Maurizio Gaudino.The point is, from half-time fan competitions (Tripgate, we’re looking at you) toKerlon’s seal dribbling, there is a lot of room for football-based silliness and ingenuity in a game saturated with monotonous tactics and refereeing segments. And with that in mind, Football Daily’s attention turns to Kasi Flava, a maverick offshoot of the game originating in South Africa, where entertainment and showboating are as important as scoring. Teams as varied as Covid-19 FC and former champions and fan favourites Skepe Nketole FC – nicknamed The Chopper Boys owing to their propensity to arrive at matches in helicopters – compete in tournaments for prizes that range from R250,000 (£10,500) cash to brandy or even sheep.Results, then, are important, but this is closer to an improvised, performative dance than a traditional match, an outpouring of joy played and watched by working-class people in the townships. “Kasi football is an art form, embedded in real-life human drama,” explains Tarminder Kaur, a senior lecturer at the University of Johannesburg. Bet you didn’t bank on reading actual quotes from an academic in Football Daily, but here we are.Surely the best clip of the recent DStv eKasi Champs of Champs tournament, broadcast live on national television, isthe winner scored by Mudagasiagainst Jukulyn in a 2-1 victory. Some of the moves are downright disrespectful: at one point Mudagasi’s players pretend to fall asleep on the ball, before their No 9 whips a genuinely brilliant Quaresma-esque trivela pass to a teammate, who neatly laces an expert finish into the far corner to send the crowd wild. Yes, please. Kasi football is not for everyone. And if you thinkRené Higuita should have just caught the ballat Wembley in 1995 and Yannick Bolasieshould have done less sweepingand more shooting, then this is probably not for you. But for this unserious, trivial tea-timely email, it’s the perfect antidote to yet another Tuesday.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Scott Murray from 8pm BST for MBM coverage of England 2-2 Italy (aet; 3-2 on pens) in the Euro 2025 semi-finals.QUOTE OF THE DAYAs soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up” –Robbie KeaneBryan Mbeumo is psyched for the new season afterjoining the club he supported as a boy.View image in fullscreenMbeumo poses with Blackburn Rovers legend Jason Wilcox, who looks a lot like Mark Chapman these days.Photograph: Manchester United/Getty ImagesFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERSManchester United’s propensity to offload football talent (yesterday’s Football Daily) didn’t start today or yesterday. The following is an XI composed of players released during the 2014-15 season alone: Johnstone S, Keane M, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Anderson, Fletcher, Kagawa, Zaha, Hernández, Welbeck. Many would back that side of cast-offs against anything else put out by United since then” – Brian Broderick.Re: where the north starts (Football Daily letters passim). I would like to suggest that based on the membership of the National League North, then it starts at Bedford, because they were promoted into the league this season, even though Bedford is just 57 miles from the middle of London. Two seasons ago, Bishop’s Stortford were members of the league, and they’re based at the end of Stansted airport’s runway. They used to love midweek games in the north-east. To extend the discussion, Merthyr Tydfil are playing in National League North this season, so where does north Wales start?” – Ray Simpson.Regarding Jon Millard’s submission that ‘the north starts at Sheffield, indisputably, as did football, also undisputedly. I’d love to say this is the one thing Noble will agree with me on, but he’d probably email in and say it’s bloody Woodall, or something’ (yesterday’s letters). He’s clearly right on football, indisputably. The north is more complex. When I was young, we used to just say that Chesterfield was the dividing line but then we thought that Bob Holness played the sax on Baker Street (false) and that he was the first person to play James Bond (false, he was the second) so what did we know? The north is very south Sheffield and just above Chesterfield so you’re looking more at a broad line of Killamarsh, Eckington, Lowedges, Totley. And, yes, that line includes Woodall” – Noble Francis.I see that, according to Jason Wilcox, new signing Bryan Mbeumo is ‘the perfect fit for Manchester United and the culture that we are developing’. That’s rather harsh criticism, isn’t it, on the lad’s first day?” – Phil Taverner.If you have any, please send letters tothe.boss@theguardian.com.Today’s winner of our prizeless letter o’ the day is … Phil Taverner.

They will face either Spain or Germany in Basel on Sunday, trying to defend the title they won in 2022.Kelly and Agyemang fire England into Euro 2025 final after comeback against ItalyRead more“Big Mich at it again!” Kelly said to ITV Sport, discussing Agyemang’s third goal in four senior international games since her April debut. “She’s unbelievable and she should have scored again: that one that hit the crossbar. She’s an unbelievable player and she’s got the world at her feet, a young player with a bright future and I’m absolutely buzzing for her. But this team shows resilience again and we fight back.”Agyemang, who also scored England’s equaliser in theirquarter-final win against Sweden, told ITV: “I’m so proud of the team’s fight and effort. It’s the character, it’s the strength of this team that has put us this far.”The Arsenal player, who was a ballgirl at Wembley as recently as 2021, said: “It means the world to me. I’m so grateful. Four years ago I was a kid just throwing a ball to some of these girls and now I’m playing with them. It’s a great opportunity and I’m so happy I am here.”The England head coach, Sarina Wiegman, who has now reached five consecutive major finals for a combination of the Netherlands and England, told BBC Radio 5 Live: “We’re going to make a movie some day! Well, this is a movie, my goodness, it’s unbelievable. Here we are again; it’s really, really special.”Wiegman also had high praise for Agyemang, saying in her press conference: “She has something special. She’s only 19 years old, she’s very mature, she knows exactly what she has to do.View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly races to congratulate Michelle Agyemang lying on the turf, after England sealed their spot in the final.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/AP“When we have to go to her as a target player, she keeps the ball really well. Even when you saw her hit the crossbar, that was not just a shot, she was aiming for it. If she continues like this she has a very bright future.”The England midfielder Ella Toone joked that it was “worth the stress”, saying: “We grafted and got the goal we needed at the end. Buzzing, we’re in another final. You always believe it [the moment will come]. We’re England, we fight to the end.”Italy sank to the floor at full time. Their head coach, Andrea Soncin, said: “Of course this defeat hurts but we have to be proud. The players have deserved a different end. Unfortunately it happens sometimes that you don’t get what you deserve. This is a bitter defeat because we were one minute away from the final.”England 2-1 Italy: Women’s Euro 2025 semi-final player ratings | Tom GarryRead moreThe match was played two days after the England defenderJess Carter revealed she had receivedwhat the England team described as poisonous racist abuse on social media. The Lionesses said they were not going to take the knee. Instead, the substitutes stood arm in arm on the touchline before kick-off, including Kelly, who said: “I’m so proud to stand side by side with the girls in this team; Jess Carter and every single player in this team.“I think it was a special and powerful moment for us, to show that this [racism] is not what we accept, not in society, not in sport, and there needs to be more done to make sure this isn’t happening over and over again. It’s disappointing to see that, sometimes, winning masks racism. It has no place in our sport and no place in society, too.”King Charles offered a message of congratulations. After praising the Lionesses’ skill and determination, and how they “inspire girls and women across the nation”, he wrote: “Good luck, England. May you roar to victory once more.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamItaly women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Some nifty boundary-striking in the gaps from Sophia Dunkley, Charlie Dean and Alice Davidson-Richards kept them in touch. But with England needing 55 from the last five overs, Jemimah Rodrigues held on to two excellent catches at long-on and the seamer Kranti Goud finished with six for 52, as England were ultimately unable to quite match the late-innings acceleration of their opponents.With the World Cup now 10 weeks away, England will take renewed confidence from the efforts of a middle order which looks at last to have absorbed some of the coach Charlotte Edwards’s lessons about prioritising intelligent cricket above showboating.“We’ve been so composed and smart – the way we navigated that run chase today from 20 for two was outstanding,” Edwards said. “Nat played a big part in that, but it was lovely to see other players contributing and we so nearly chased that down.”England could have sent Harmanpreet Kaur packing for 22, had they referred an lbw call in the 28th over to the third umpire. It was one of two non-referrals which would have led to an Indian batter being dismissed – the other was against Harleen Deol – and exposed some uncertainty about England’s DRS chain-of-command. Traditionally, it is the captain who makes the final call, but both times here Sciver-Brunt appeared to rely purely on Amy Jones’s judgment.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Nat Sciver-Brunt is caught out by Richa Ghosh, bringing to an end her innings of 98.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images/ReutersSciver-Brunt eventually held on to a diving catch at extra cover to dismiss Kaur, but with just eight balls left of the innings it was too late to atone. India’s captain, who had failed to score above 26 in six previous innings on this tour, specialises in scoring runs when her back is against the wall and on Tuesday – after finally winning a toss at the eighth time of asking – her seventh ODI hundred was the mainstay of India’s match-winning total.Earlier, Sophie Ecclestone had conceded just 28 runs in her 10 overs, sending down a remarkable opening spell of 7-2-14-1, including a wicket maiden in which a frustrated Smriti Mandhana pulled straight to Dunkley at short midwicket. But she was bowled out by the 34th over, leaving India to go big at the back end, hammering 120 from the final 10 overs.In an interview broadcast by Sky before the match, Ecclestone revealed that she had come close to retiring earlier in the summer because of the ongoing fallout from the Women’s Ashes, during which she came under fire after refusing an interview with the BBC’s Alex Hartley.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a tough time. I was so tired and so drained from the last few months.”Speaking for the first time about the Hartley incident, she said that she felt it had been “blown out of proportion”, adding: “I had to put myself first in that situation. Warm-ups in an Ashes game were more important for me [than doing an interview].”Edwards said she had been unaware Ecclestone was considering retirement, adding: “She’s had an exceptional series.

We also have to wait for the right moments [to go forward] but these moments will come.“We have to show our strengths in attack, which we couldn’t really do against France, when we have the ball. We have our philosophy and our principles and how we want to play as a German team and they haven’t changed. We want to go into the duels and actively win the ball.”Spain have had one more day’s rest, having beaten Switzerland 2-0 on Friday, before Germany’s energy‑sapping win against France. Germany produced a heroic display after Hendrich’s sending-off for pulling Griedge Mbock’s hair in her own penalty area. They went 1-0 down from the resulting penalty but Sjoeke Nüsken equalised in the first half before a rearguard action enabled Germany to take the game to penalties.Rebecca Knaak, one of the defenders who had to deal with sustained France pressure, said the performance had set the benchmark for the players’ work rate: “The game against France showed what is needed in terms of fighting spirit, passion, desire and unity. Those are the values that we have to embody and they will be important against Spain, too.”Germany won eight out of nine European championships between 1989 and 2013 (the first secured by West Germany) but countries such as Spain – and England – have moved ahead of them. They did reach the Euro 2022 final, losing against the Lionesses, but the following year’s World Cup was another step back, the team going out at the group stage.Germany’s Jule BrandWück – whose appointment was announced in March 2024, with his first game against England in October – has introduced a more attacking style with the wingers Jule Brand and Klara Bühl crucial to his tactics. Both players have been in fine form in Switzerland, with Wück picking out the former for particular praise on Tuesday. “Jule’s performances from the first game against Poland through to the quarter-final against France speak for themselves. She has taken the next step up and proved that she is continuing to develop. I am very pleased with her.”Spain have their own array of attacking players with Esther González (four goals) and Alèxia Putellas (three) among the tournament’s four top scorers, and Clàudia Pina and Athenea del Castillo one behind. Putellas said on Tuesday that they had to keep their focus to reach the final.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tomorrow they will field their best team to play against us, just as we will.“Excitement is the main driving force of this team. This is the tournament where we’re feeling most comfortable.

More lie in an open packet on the table between them. This is not a photograph taken before smoking bans, but a picture shared on social media of a gathering in the metaverse.Virtual online spaces are becoming a new marketing battleground as tobacco and alcohol promoters target young people without any legislative consequences.A report shared at the World Conference on Tobacco Control last month in Dublinset out multiple examplesof new technologies being adopted to promote smoking and vaping, including tobacco companies launching digital tokens and vape companies sponsoring online games.It comes from a monitoring project known asCanary– because it seeks to act as the canary in a coalmine – run by the global public health organisation Vital Strategies.View image in fullscreenThe caption on this post reads ‘Having coffee in the metaverse. Has anyone stolen the lighters?’Photograph: iceperience.id Instagram via Canary“Tobacco companies are no longer waiting for regulations to catch them up. They are way ahead of us. We are still trying to understand what we’re seeing in social media, but they’re already operating in unregulated spaces like the metaverse,” says Dr Melina Magsumbol, of Vital Strategies India. “They’re using NFTs [non-fungible tokens]. They’re using immersive events to get our kids to come and see what they’re offering.”In India, one tobacco company made and promoted anNFT, which represents ownership of digital assets, to celebrate its 93rd anniversary.Canary scans for and analyses tobacco marketing on social media platforms and news sites in India, Indonesia and Mexico. It is expanding to more countries, including Brazil and China, and to cover alcohol and ultra-processed food marketing.Digital platforms are being used to bypass traditional advertising restrictions and target young audiencesMelina Magsumbol, Vital Strategies IndiaIt is not set up to scan the metaverse – a three-dimensional, immersive version of the internet that uses technology such as virtual reality headsets to enable people to interact in a digital space. But it has picked up references to what is going on there via links and information shared on older social media sites.Researchers say that children are likely to be exposed to any tobacco marketing in the new digital spaces given the age profile of users – more than half of the metaverse’s active users areaged 13 and below.Social media companies have deep knowledge of how to drive engagement and keep people coming back for more views, says Dr Mary-Ann Etiebet, chief executive of Vital Strategies.“When you combine that with the experience and the knowledge of the tobacco industry on how to hook and keep people hooked … those two things together in a space that is unknown and opaque – that scares me.”Mark Zuckerberg, metaverse’s prominent backer, says in future “you’ll be able to do almost anything you can imagine” there. Already, that includes shopping and attending virtual concerts.But Magsumbol describes it as “a new battleground for all of us” that is “being taken over by corporate entities that actually push health-harming products”.“My daughter is very quiet, she’s an introvert. But online, on [gaming platform] Roblox, when she is killing zombies and ghosts, she morphs into a different avatar – she’s like Alexander the Great mixed with Bruce Lee and John Wick. She is so bloodthirsty,” she says.“Online we behave differently. Social norms change … the tobacco industry knows that very well. And it’s so easy to subtly sell the idea that you can be anything, anyone you want.”The metaverse art the team saw in Indonesia was shared on an Instagram account for electronic music lovers linked to Djarum, one of Indonesia’s largest cigarette companies. Another example showed a group having coffee, and looking for a lighter.It all amounts to efforts to “normalise” smoking and vaping, says Magsumbol. “This kind of behaviour is happening and being done by your avatars, but is it seeping into your real life?“Digital platforms are being used to bypass traditional advertising restrictions and target young audiences,” she says. “What we’re seeing here is not just a shift in marketing, it’s a shift in how influence works.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She has seen vapes suggested as a “wellness” item.“I think educating youth on what an advertisement looks like, why it’s false, how you might not even see that it’s from the tobacco industry and it’s [content posted by an] influencer is really powerful because then that builds a skill – so that when they’re on social media, because they are digital natives, they’re able to see all of that and know that it’s fake and it’s not something they should be attracted by. I think building those skills early from high school to middle school, and even younger, is really important.”TheWHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Controlrequires countries to implement bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. Last year,signatories agreedthat action was needed to tackle the increasing focus on “digital marketing channels such as social media, which increases adolescent and young people’s exposure to tobacco marketing”.View image in fullscreenA boy smokes a cigarette in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.Photograph: Ulet Ifansasti/Getty ImagesBut there is no easy answer, says Andrew Black at the framework’s secretariat.“The challenge of regulating the internet is not a problem that’s unique to tobacco. It’s a real challenge for governments to think about how they can provide the protections that society is used to in a world where borders are broken down because of these technologies.”Nandita Murukutla, who oversees Canary, says regulators should take note: “What starts out small and you ignore, rises up to a certain point when you’ve got critical mass, and after that, it just explodes, and dialling something back is virtually impossible.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

However, that toolhas been criticisedfor disproportionately flagging certain nationalities.Despite concerns about AI tools exacerbating bias in government decision-making, ministers are exploring other potential uses. Peter Kyle, the science and technology secretary,announced on Mondaya deal with OpenAI, the company that runs ChatGPT, to explore deploying AI in areas including justice, security and education.Bolt’s report said that the mental health of young asylum seekers was suffering because of failures in the age verification systems, especially at Dover, where small boat arrivals are processed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Individual researchers, most equipped with PhDs in computer science, are commanding giant salaries and mammoth signing bonuses in hiring negotiations. You might call them talent.The Washington Postcalled them Olympians in a recent headline: “Why AI superathletes could be winning $100 million bonuses in Silicon Valley.” These are the most sought-after employees in the world.Tech companies are tasking the star players of their AI squads with developing technology that can outperform humans in any task, a goal known as “artificial general intelligence”, or with creating AI models that surpass human intelligence overall, an objective known as “superintelligence”.In pursuit of these grails, Silicon Valley is throwing around amounts of money that could found dynasties. The scramble is so desperate and remunerative that the poaching of individual researchers makes news, though they may have been unknown before now. A headline inWired: “Another High-Profile OpenAI Researcher Departs for Meta”. InBloomberg: “Meta Hires Two Key Apple AI experts After Poaching Their Boss.” Inthe Information: “Anthropic Hires Back Two Coding AI Leaders From Cursor Developer Anysphere”. All of these stories were published in the past week.The tech press’ furor over these researchers reminds me of sports media covering the trades of star players. The dissection of their pay, the speculation about who’s next onMeta’s list, the playing of one company off another, the discussion of each company’s team composition or overall strategy and the attention to this individual player or that one are all redolent of the scrutinized trade of US basketball phenomenonLuka Dončićfrom the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers, for example.The word “Another” in Wired’s headline is a cue that one company is fueling this frenzy: Meta. Mark Zuckerberg has made eye-popping claims about his firm’s spending over the past week. He said that his company will spend “hundreds of billions” of dollars on its artificial intelligence efforts. In April, Meta revised its planned capital expenditure for this year alone upward to a range of $64bn to $75bn. The company’s previous range was $60bn to $65bn. In 2023, Meta’s capex was a measly $28bn, according toFortune.Zuckerberg is backing his pledges with cash. In early July, Meta hired away the leader of Apple’s AI models team, Ruoming Pang, with a jumbo-sized pay package worth some $200m. The researcher joins Meta’s Superintelligence team, perhaps the most expensive team of engineers since the Manhattan Project.Putting this trading frenzy in perspective is one Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, who made the point early last week that half of the top AI researchers in the worldreside in China. Huang made the remark in Beijing, where he was attending a conference and celebrating Donald Trump’s new allowance for Huang’s extremely profitable company to sell its most advanced semiconductors in China, where there is strong demand for them. Previously, Nvidia’s chips had been subject to strict export restrictions. Huang’s nod to China’s stock of AI researchers highlights the fact that American firms are pouring money into a pool of English-speaking talent that may yet be outclassed by its competition across the Pacific, no matter how much the tech giants pay.A spate of iPhone and Samsung alternatives make a play for your pocketView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSeveral companies have created phones in recent years attempting to provide alternatives to the industry’s biggest players, in some cases capitalizing on growing anxieties over how smartphones are dominating our lives or simply attempting to rebel against the monopolistic hold Apple and Samsung have over the market.One option isa device newly released in the UK by Sage Mobile, which is an iPhone 16 loaded with custom software that prohibits internet searches, gaming downloads and social media apps like Instagram. As UK technology editor Robert Booth writes, the bespoke handset costs more than double a standard UK iPhone contract and is marketed at children with the selling point of helping them “reconnect with real life”:The devices will include an app store that is curated by Sage Mobile and will only allow users access to apps for tasks like banking, public transport, schooling, calendars and weather.Experience with a similar device sold in the US showed children used it for between 15 minutes and an hour a day, instead of average screen time in the UK of almost three hours a day among eight to 14-year-olds. Kaspar said children lose interest in it because “it’s not as magical, it’s not as fun”, resulting in many reclaimed “life hours”.An anonymous 16-year-old reviewergave the phone a test runfor the Guardian, finding that using Sage highlighted just how dependent their social life was on the myriad of apps and platforms they had grown up on. Although they felt more productive and spent more time talking with their family, creating a clean severance between online and offline life was more complicated than simply blocking your apps:The people at Sage said it could take a month to get used to the limitations, but I don’t have that long to test it. I can already tell you that if you are a teenager you are going to feel disconnected from all of your friends and the rest of the world and that feels unfair. Having TikTok and Instagram is the way the world is wired now. If you take them away then it’s quite hard to stay in the loop.If I stayed with this phone I would also end up feeling left out when speaking in real life to my friends as this is where so many of our sayings and jokes come from.The London-based company Nothing takes a different tack with its device, the minimally named Phone 3. Rather than a restricted or pared-down version of an iPhone or Android it is an attempt to create a design-forward, quirky phone with touches like a tiny LED screen on the back of its transparent semi-transparent case.Built off Nothing’s version of an Android operating system, the phone carries much of the functionality but with unique elements that try to differentiate it from Apple and Samsung’s ubiquitous devices. As consumer technology editorSamuel Gibbs writes in his four out of five stars review, you’ll need to really prize that differentiation to make it worthwhile:The Phone 3 is a good but not great Android from Nothing. It is more interesting than rivals, but you have to actively want something different for it to make sense as you can easily get better-performing and longer-lasting handsets at about this price.Tech firms are spending big on physical footprintsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: APIn his pledge to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI, Zuckerberg said his company was at work constructinga data center nearly as big as Manhattan. The enormous complex, brought to life by Meta’s equally humongous capital expenditure, will be named after Hyperion, a Greek titan who personified the sun. Zuckerberg christened a second, smaller data center Prometheus after the titan who brought humans fire and was punished eternally for stealing sacred knowledge from the gods on Mount Olympus. Is the data center the titan bringing us the fire? Or are we, the human beings who have created AI, the titan? If so, what will our punishment be? Whatever the feelings the name inspires in you, Zuckerberg has made yet another declaration of titanic ambition. The novel Frankenstein has a second, less famous title that seems relevant: The Modern Prometheus.Google is also expanding its earthly ambitions, witha $3bn hydropower dealand a plan to invest $25bn in data centers across Pennsylvania and neighboring states over the next two years. Apple, too, is leaving its mark witha $500m deal for rare earths mineralsthat it struck with a US mining company.The wider TechScapeInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine watersOpenAI launches personal assistant capable of controlling files and web browsersRoyal Society suggested to Elon Musk he consider resigning science fellowshipZuckerberg and Meta officers settle claim they lost company billions by violating privacy lawsRisk of undersea cable attacks backed by Russia and China likely to rise, report warnsHouthi-linked dealers sell arms on X and WhatsApp, report saysExplore more on these topicsTechScape newsletternewslettersShareReuse this content"

It’s what we turn to in times of strife, when spirits are flagging, or to start our day. And when a visitor calls, one of the first things we do is put the kettle on.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.While many small appliances have evolved beyond their original form, the kettle’s basic principles remain largely unchanged. Water goes in and heats up until a thermostat switches it off; the water then pours out, and we enjoy a cuppa. However, the technology that goes into a kettle has been slowly improving: better insulation to keep water hotter for longer and reduce reboils; different temperature settings to suit every drink from green tea to herbal brews; and more features such as filters and concealed elements to keep scale out of our cups.When your existing kettle makes its last brew and must be taken to the big recycling centre in the sky, it pays to check out what’s on offer to replace it. The next one you buy may make more of a difference to your day than you might think.At a glanceBest kettle overall:Bosch Sky kettle£76 at AmazonBest budget kettle:Kenwood Ripple kettle£29.99 at KenwoodThe forever kettleDualit Classic kettle£140 at CurrysBest quiet kettle:Zwilling Enfinigy Pro kettle£139 at ZwillingBest budget variable temperature kettle:Lakeland Digital double-walled kettle£44.99 at LakelandWhy you should trust meWhen a friend heard I was writing this, she asked me, “Aren’t all kettles the same? They all boil water, don’t they?” And while she’s right about the second part, it took me at least 15 minutes to explain why she was wrong about the first. I’ve been testing kettles for years and they vary greatly – in design, weight, ease of maintenance, ease of use and build quality. Some will last for decades while others will barely make it past the basic guarantee period. In short, yes, all kettles boil water – but they are far from being all the same.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach kettle was hooked up to a power meter to assess electricity consumption.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianAs you can imagine, I boiled a lot of water. Litres upon litres of the stuff. Enough to turn my kitchen into the steamiest hammam and clear my pores of blackheads I’ve had since I was a teenager.But testing wasn’t just about making gallons of tea and having a deep skin cleanse on the cheap. I also brought a lot of gadgets to the party: a power meter to assess electricity use for each kettle when boiling exactly one litre of water from cold; a timer to measure how long that took; and a probe thermometer to gauge how long it took for the kettle to click off once it had reached boiling point.External temperature was measured using an infrared thermometer and the highest reading noted, while maximum noise levels were recorded with the Decibel X app. After boiling, water temperature was checked at the 30-minute, one- and two-hour points to see how much it had cooled.I tested 12 kettles in total. Those we tested but haven’t included areCurrys Essentials C17JKW17 jug kettle, which is a snip at £8.99 but lacks durability, and theRussell Hobbs Travel Light white small kettle 23840, which is probably one of the best travel kettles you can buy at £20, but took almost six minutes to boil its 850ml.The ones that made the cut were selected on the basis of good energy efficiency or low minimum fill, plus ease of use or maintenance. Value for money has also been considered, as have longer guarantees and durable build quality that should translate into a lengthy lifespan for the appliance. All samples have been returned to their supplier or donated toCaterham Round Tableto raise funds for local causes and charity projects.The best kettles in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBest kettle overall:Bosch SkykettleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£100 at John Lewis£76 at AmazonOffering variable temperatures and a double-walled stainless-steel housing, the 3kW Sky is a brilliant blend of robust form and function. It boasts a low minimum boil (300ml), a keep-warm setting and touch controls.Why we love itI found it difficult to select a best kettle from so many that performed well, but the Bosch Sky clinched it because it’s such a good all-rounder that will suit most people. It pours well, has a button that’s within easy reach of the handle so it’s simple to open the lid without touching it, and it’s insulated so the exterior doesn’t become too hot to touch. From a design perspective, it has a more industrial feel than many others – no frippery here – but not too modern that it wouldn’t fit into most kitchens. Its display is thoughtfully designed, easy to keep clean and lights up as it heats.The exterior doesn’t get too hot (up to 40C), and while it wasn’t the fastest to boil in testing, it was only seconds behind the Dualit below. It clicked off at boiling point, and the water was still a toasty 78C 30 minutes later. At the hour point, it was 66C, and two hours 52C, meaning you’ll spend less time and energy reboiling.It’s a shame that …its premium look ends at the handle, which seems cheap and plasticky next to the sleek aesthetic of the rest of it.Time to boil one litre:2mins 22secsMinimum fill:300mlPower use:0.112kWh = 3p at 25.73p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximumnoise recorded:59dBTemperature settings:70C, 75C, 80C, 85C, 90C, 95C, 100C, keep warmWarranty:two yearsBest budget kettle:Kenwood RipplekettleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£29.99 at Kenwood£29.99 at AmazonAvailable in four “ocean-inspired” shades – eggshell blue, storm blue, pure white and midnight black – Kenwood’s Ripple kettle has a subtle design that belies its affordable price tag. It’s practical, too: there’s a 3kW element, a wide pouring spout to prevent drips, and two water windows showing cups on one side and litres on the other (making it left-hander friendly).Why we love itMore affordable kettles tend to demand a higher minimum fill – usually 500ml – but the Ripple enables those on a budget to boil a single cup (200ml), providing excellent energy economy. There’s even a plastic marker inside for one and two cups and max, so you don’t need to watch the water window as you’re filling. It’s lightweight at 950g without feeling flimsy, has a pull-off lid for easier filling, and it boiled quickly in testing, retaining its heat well for the first 30 minutes (72C) and hour (60C).It’s a shame that …the lightweight plastic body meant that the external temperature was very hot after boiling (80C). Its two-hour temperature (44C) was also much cooler than the one-hour point, meaning more energy is needed to reboil.Time to boil:2mins 30secsMinimum fill:200mlPower use:0.118kWh = 3p at 25.73p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximum noise recorded:57dBTemperature settings:100CWarranty:one yearThe forever kettle:Dualit ClassickettleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£140 at Currys£149.99 at John LewisAlthough it comes with a higher initial outlay, Dualit’s Classic kettle is more of a “buy right, buy once” appliance. It’s as robust as they come, with a durable stainless-steel body, hinged lid, anti-wobble feet and non-drip spout. But it’s the repairable nature of this kettle that makes it an eco-friendly buy. The 3kW element is replaceable, so a pro can swap it for a new one or repair it if it wears out, meaning you may never need to buy a new kettle again.Why we love itRepairability aside, the Dualit Classic kettle also makes it easy to boil only as much water as you need, with a low minimum fill (250ml) and dual water windows indicating cups and litres via multiple markings. There’s no button to raise the lid, meaning one less thing to go wrong; instead, it has a heatproof plastic handle. It was also the fastest boiling of all the kettles tested and clicked off bang on boiling point.It’s a shame that …the exterior gets hot after boiling – our sample reached 71C.

I also appreciated the clear display and choice of temperatures, as well as the reassuring lifetime warranty. It was easily the quietest when boiling and didn’t grow hot on the exterior, reaching a cool-touch 31C. Heat retention was brilliant: after 30 minutes, the water was still 81C, dropping to only 71C after an hour and 57C after two.It’s a shame that …it’s a seriously slow boiler, due to its 1.85kW element, and it continued to boil for three seconds after reaching 100C.Time to boil:4mins 7secsMinimum fill:500mlPower use:0.121kWh = 3p at 25.73p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximum noise recorded:43dBTemperature settings:40C, 60C, 70C, 80C, 93C, 100C, keep warmWarranty:lifetimeBest budget variable temperature kettle:Lakeland Digitaldouble-walledkettleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£44.99 at Lakeland£44.99 at AmazonLakeland’s Digital double-walled kettle proves you don’t have to splash the cash for a well-insulated, variable temperature kettle – or one with a decent warranty length.

It’s easy to read from afar, and the temperature is easy to set with plus and minus buttons. The kettle looks and feels premium for the price, with its measurements all marked on the interior.The double-walled construction served it well: the exterior reached only 27C, while the water was still 78C after 30 minutes, dropping to 67C after an hour and 53C after two.

It’s well insulated too, with the exterior only reaching 32C after boiling and the water still registering a balmy 57C after two hours.It didn’t make the final cut because …its 1.8kW element meant it was slow to boil, and it took about six seconds to click off after reaching boiling point.

The good stuff: it’s stylish, has excellent build quality and a 3kW element that boiled very fast. It also clicked off as soon as it reached 100C, and has a base that allows the cable to emerge from anywhere it pleases. There’s an extensive choice of colours, too, plus a soft-rise lid for minimal splashes.It didn’t make the final cut because …minimum fill appears to be 500ml, although it’s not marked as such, and the external temperature reached a sizzling 99C after boiling.

For example, kettles that are dual-walled help to trap heat inside, so the water stays warmer for longer while the outside stays cool to the touch.Those with low minimum fills enable you to boil just enough water for a single cup, so you don’t waste energy heating more than you need. Some kettles also have a keep-warm function that stops the water cooling below a certain temperature, which is ideal for those who become distracted after boiling or drink consecutive cuppas. It’s a good idea to check for safety features too, such as an auto shut-off to prevent it from boiling dry if there’s not enough water.Other features are more “nice to haves”: variable temperature models enable you to choose water heated to lower temperatures than boiling, such as 70C or 80C, for other types of tea or for filling a hot-water bottle. Concealed elements, which are easier to keep scale-free, and removable, washable limescale filters will be useful for those who live in hard-water areas. Then there’s connectivity. While wifi-enabled and voice-controlled kettles can feel a little gimmicky, they can be a gift for busy parents who usually have their hands full.Are rapid-boiling kettles faster than normal ones?Rapid-boil kettles don’t have a strict industry definition, so while a rapid-boil kettle should boil water quickly, it may not differ much from one that’s not labelled as such.A more reliable indicator of how fast a kettle will boil is its power rating: this is listed either in watts (eg 3,000W) or kilowatts (eg 2.2kW). The higher the number, the more power its element can use to heat water quickly. However, this isn’t the whole story: boiling times can also be quicker in double-walled kettles (as they lose less heat to their surroundings) and those with concealed or flat elements (which provide more surface area to heat the water than a coil).How to descale your kettleLimescale reduces your kettle’s efficiency, costing you more to boil each time, and shortening the appliance’s lifespan. Descale it monthly, especially if you live in a hard-water area. Standing water encourages the buildup of limescale, so try not to leave water in the kettle after use.While you can buy descaler in the supermarket, a lower-cost and more eco-friendly option is to combine a weak food-safe acid, such as white vinegar or lemon juice, with water. Fill the kettle three-quarters with either water and the juice of one lemon or equal parts water and vinegar. Let it soak for an hour, then boil the kettle (once for vinegar, three times for lemon). Once it’s cooled, rinse thoroughly. If your kettle has a removable filter, take it out and rinse it under running water at the same time.Rachel Ogden has worked as a consumer journalist for decades, becoming an expert unboxer before it was a thing, although she’s much lessadept at repacking.

Kyle said he wanted Britain to be “front and centre when it comes to developing and deploying AI” and “this can’t be achieved without companies like OpenAI”.But the deal has also led to concerns. Onwurah said: “We want assurance that there will be transparency over what public data OpenAI will have access to for training and that it will remain in the UK and within the UK’s data protection framework and legislation.“It’s important for public trust that the government is more transparent about how this relationship will work. The public is certainly not convinced that the tech giants are on their side or that AI is on their side. They need to have confidence that the government is on their side.”She cited “major failures” in public sector IT procurement, includingthe Post Office Horizon scandal, and said: “We hope and expect that the government has learned the lessons of previous failed technology procurement in its relationship with OpenAI and other AI companies it is bringing into the public sector.”A spokesperson for the department for science, innovation and technology said:“AI has immense potential to make public services more efficient by completing basic admin tasks, allowing experts to focus on the important work they’re hired to deliver.“This partnership does not give OpenAI access to government datasets. We always comply with data protection legislation, and any future decisions in this space, including around procurement, would need to follow the usual robust processes.”The deal with OpenAI comes after anagreement this month with Googleto provide free technology to the public sector, from the NHS to local councils, and to upskill tens of thousands of civil servants in technology, including AI.Other Silicon Valley companies already working in the UK public sector include Anduril, a US military technology company that provides AI-enabled “kill web” systems. It has been working with the British military.Google, Amazon,Microsoftand Palantir were among technology companies that attended a meeting last month with the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, at which ideas were suggested to insert tracking devices under offenders’ skin and assign robots to contain prisoners.The latest agreement includes OpenAI’s possible participation in the government’s plan for “AI growth zones” which could see huge datacentres built around the UK.Altman said the agreement would enable the UK government to realise the potential of its AI policy by “turning ambition to action and delivering prosperity for all”.But Martha Dark, the executive director of Foxglove, a campaign group for fairer technology, called the level of detail “hopelessly vague”.“The British government has a treasure trove of public data that would be of enormous commercial value to OpenAI in helping to train the next incarnation of ChatGPT,” she said.“This is yet more evidence of this government’s credulous approach to big tech’s increasingly dodgy sales pitch. Peter Kyle seems bizarrely determined to put the big tech fox in charge of the henhouse when it comes to UK sovereignty.”Human-level AI is not inevitable. We have the power to change course | Garrison LovelyRead moreSameer Vuyyuru, the chief AI and product officer at Capita, another provider of AI services to the public sector, said there was now “a complete acknowledgment that AI plays a role in the future of public services”. But he said there was a gap between their desire for the efficiency savings and understanding how best to procure AI services.“The public sector is viewed as one of the most fertile areas for the implementation of AI,” he said, adding that fertility meant radically increased public sector efficiency as well as revenue growth for providers.He said AI agents would typically operate on, rather than take ownership of, public data. While AI use is now “minuscule”, he said up to 50% of often “mind-numbing and menial” public service tasks could benefit from AI.This could mean cutting waiting times for renewing a driving licence, applying to join the army or applying for tuition subsidies by speeding up the number of cases a civil servant could process from 10 a day to 30 or even 50 with the assistance of an AI agent.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

There are many bleaker, deadlier things happening daily in this country, and the field of late-night comedy has been dying slowly for years, but the cancellation of The Late Show, three days after Colbert called out its parent company for settling a lawsuit with Donald Trump, felt especially and pointedly depressing – more a sign of cultural powerlessness and corporate fecklessness in the face of a bully president than the inevitable result of long-shifting tastes.The end of Stephen Colbert’s Late Show is a concerning nail in the coffin for comedy | Jesse HassengerRead moreReporting in the days since the announcement have lent some credence to CBS’s claim that this was “purely a financial decision”. Though The Late Show has led the field of late-night comedy in ratings for years, it only averages about 2.47 million viewers a night. Its ad revenue plummeted after the pandemic; Puck’s Matthew Bellonireportedthat the show loses $40m for CBS every year. Of the network late-night shows – NBC’s Late Night With Seth Meyers, The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon, and ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live! – Colbert’s Late Show has the smallest footprint on social media, where Fallon’s celebrity gags still reign supreme. The format of late-night television – a host delivering a topical monologue, house band, celebrity guest interviews – is a living relic of a different time, when a youth-skewing audience would reliably pop on linear television at 11.30pm. The field has been contracting for years, with programs hosted by Samantha Bee, James Corden and Taylor Tomlinson ending without replacement. Ad revenue for the genre as a whole is down 50% from just seven years ago, in the middle of Trump 1.0. It’s long been assumed that the hosts currently in these once-coveted chairs would be the last, their programs expiring when they decided to step down.What’s shocking is that Colbert, who was reportedly set to renegotiate his one-year contract at the end of this season, was not given that time, which just so happens tocoincide with a critical windowfor theintended mergerof CBS parent company Paramount with Skydance Media. Three days before the announcement, Colbert called Paramount’s settlement with Trump a “big fat bribe” to incentivize the administration’s approval of this $8bn deal managed by two billionaire families.Regardless of Colbert’s contract timing, it seems the cancellation of The Late Showisa financial decision, just not in the way CBS is framing it. It’s not about the $40m The Late Show is losing per year – a lot of money, to be sure, though a drop in the bucket for the major players here – but the $8bn on the line with this merger. There were presumably other options; Late Night With Seth Meyers dispensed of its house band and musical acts last year to save money. With new billionaire ownership, there could be some business maneuvering, should independent political comedy be a priority. Colbert’s Late Show, a leading critic of Donald Trump on network television, is clearly not; the show may have been a money loser, but in this context, it’s a convenient sacrifice.And though it’s easy to roll one’s eyes at late-night television – I often do – it’s an especially disappointing one, both in the culture at large and in the dwindling 11.35pm time slot. For years, I havearguedthat the late-night shows have long outstripped their original function as comedy programs. They are satirical, occasionally relevant, sometimes profane, but hardly ever funny, in the traditional sense of making you laugh. Often, they resort to so-called “clapter” – laughter as a polite applause, jokes for agreement rather than laughter – in adeadening anti-Trump feedback loop. With the exception of The Daily Show, a cable program founded for the purpose of political satire, the shows basically serve two functions in the internet era: 1 Generate viral celebrity content as they promote another project, and 2 Comment freely on the news, unbound from the strictures of decorum, tone and supposed “objectivity” that hamstrings so much journalism in the US.How should late-night comedy handle a third Trump candidacy?Read moreThe latter was, I’d argue, the most important contribution of late-night television in the Trump era, when the president and his minions exceeded parody, and Colbert was the best at it. Nimble, erudite, self-deprecating but exceptionally well-read, Colbert transformed from extremely successful Fox News satirist to the reverend father of late-night TV: principled, authoritative but hardly ever self-righteous, deeply faithful to the American project, steadfastly believing in the decency of others. (Colbert is a practicing Catholic and die-hard Lord of the Rings fan, facts that sometimes snuck into his monologues.) At times, such old-school values felt insufficient for the moment; the format of late-night comedy as a whole has proven futile, even pathetic, in the face of Donald Trump’s brand of shamelessness, the Maga movement’s ability to turn everything into a joke. But these hosts, and the Daily Show-trained Colbert especially, did something that the rest of news media or the sprawling celebrity and comedian podcast network could not: call bullshit on the administration with the imprimatur of a major television network, and say exactly what they were feeling.That ability proved useful to me, as a viewer, at times when it seemed standard media was incapable of articulating what was happening. During the pandemic, or the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, or on January 6, or when Trump was re-elected, or when Republicans mocked Californians during the devastating LA wildfires earlier this year, late-night television had the freedom to express outrage, and Colbert in particular to express moral injury. The jokes were almost never surprising; they weren’t really even jokes. But it still felt soothing to see someone say them, with corporate backing, at an institution that still carried enough name recognition to, well, merit a “late-night roundup”.Colbert, ultimately, will be fine. He is a skilled comedian whose talents weren’t always well-tapped by the strict format of late-night comedy. Perhaps he will join the legion of comedians with podcasts, speaking directly to fans; perhaps he will release a special. But his absence from late-night televisionspells doomfor the rest of the format, and more importantly for freedom of speech on the big networks. Late-night comedy has been fighting a losing battle for a long time, and The Late Show was never going to out-influence the rising tide of rightwing media, the manosphere or any number of independent shows in a fracturing media landscape. But the fact that he could try, from one of the more famed perches in television, still meant something.Explore more on these topicsStephen ColbertOpinionTrump administrationParamount PicturesUS televisionTV comedyComedyTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

In that case, the court’s rightwing supermajority essentially gave Trump carte blancheto dismantle the Department of Education, which plays an important role in the lives of the nation’s 50 million public schoolchildren, sending federal money to schools, helping students with disabilities and enforcing anti-discrimination laws.Manylegal experts, along with the court’s three liberal justices, protested that the court was letting Trump abolish a congressionally created federal agency without Congress’s approval.In their dissent, the liberal justices warned that the court was undermining Congress’s authority and the constitution’s separation of powers. Not only that, we should all be concerned that the court was giving dangerous new powers to the most authoritarian-minded president in US history.Trump cannot dispel the ghost of Jeffrey Epstein | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreIn the Department of Education case, the court issued a one-paragraph, unsigned order that lifted a lower court’s injunction that blocked the Trump administration from making wholesale layoffs that went far toward dismantling the department. Recognizing that Article I of the constitution gives Congress the power to create and fund federal agencies and define their responsibilities, prior supreme court decisions have held that presidents don’t have the power to defy what Congress has legislated andgut an agencywithout Congress’s approval.In a stinging dissent, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote: “Only Congress has the power to abolish the Department. The Executive’s task, by contrast, is to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’” Sotomayor added that the court’s order “permitting the Government to proceed with dismantling the Department” was “indefensible”.Making the court’s move even more maddening was its failure to include any reasoning to explain its action – it was the most recent in a string of brief “emergency docket” orders which, without giving any rationale, ruled in Trump’s favor. The rightwing justices might argue that this was a harmless, minor order, merely lifting a lower court’s injunction until the case is fully adjudicated. But by vacating the injunction, the court let Linda McMahon, the secretary of education, speed ahead with her plan to slash the department’s workforce by over 50%, a move that will gut the agency and prevent it from carrying out many functions that Congress authorized it to do. The supreme court’s order is likely to leave the department an empty shell by the time the judiciary issues a final ruling on whether Trump broke the law in gutting the department – and there’s a good chance the judiciary will conclude that Trump acted illegally.TheTrump administrationinsisted that it wasn’t dismantling the education department, that it had merely ordered massive layoffs there to boost efficiency. But the district court judge didn’t buy the administration’s arguments, especially because Trump had spoken so frequently about killing the department.Sotomayor wrote that the constitution requires all presidents, including Trump, to faithfully execute the law. But in this case, Trump seemed eager to execute the Department of Education, while showing scant concern for executing the law. Noting Trump’s repeated vows to abolish the department, Sotomayor chided the supermajority, writing: “When the Executive publicly announces its intent to break the law, and then executes on that promise, it is the Judiciary’s duty to check that lawlessness, not expedite it.”With that language, the three dissenting justices were in essence accusing the supermajority of aiding and abetting Trump’s defiance of the law. In the court’s 236-year history, rarely have dissenting justices been so emphatic in criticizing the majority for “expediting” a president’s lawlessness.Sotomayor hammered that point home, writing: “The President must take care that the laws are faithfully executed, not set out to dismantle them. That basic rule undergirds our Constitution’s separation of powers. Yet today, the majority rewards clear defiance of that core principle.”If the US constitution means anything, it means that the supreme court should stand up to a president who seeks to maximize his power by defying the law. But far too often today’s rightwing supermajority seems to lean in to back Trump. The court leaned in for Trump last year in Chief Justice John Roberts’ much-criticized ruling that gave Trump and other presidentsvast immunity from prosecution. The supermajority leaned in for Trump last month when it gave Elon Musk and his Doge twentysomethingsaccess to sensitive personal informationfor over 70 million Americans on social security.One would think the nine justices would be eager to strengthen the pillars that uphold our democracy: the separation of powers, fair elections, respect for the law, limits on the power of the executive. But the Roberts court has too often weakened those pillars: by giving Trump huge immunity from prosecution, by turning a blind eye to egregious gerrymandering that prevents fair elections and by letting Trump fire top officials from independent agencies long before their terms end. In late June, the supermajoritycurbed district courts’ abilityto issue nationwide injunctions to put a brake on Trump’s rampant lawlessness – by that time, lower court judges hadissued more than 190 ordersblocking or temporarily pausing Trump actions they deemed unlawful.In the Department of Education case, the court again weakened a pillar upholding our democracy; it gave Trump a green light to ignore Congress’s wishes and take a wrecking ball to the department. It’s hugely dismaying that the court undercut Congress’s power at a time when Trump has transformed the nation’s senators and representatives into an assemblage of compliant kittens by intimidating them with a social media bullhorn that bludgeons anyone who dares to defy his wishes. Instead of shoring up Congress’s power in the face of such intimidation, the Roberts court has seemed happy to undermine Congress and hand over more power to Trump.On top of all that, it is galling to see the court issue so many pro-Trump orders without giving any rationale. When the US is so polarized and the court so widely criticized for its many pro-Trump rulings, it would seem incumbent upon the court, when issuing orders, to explain why it’s doing what it’s doing. But the court has repeatedly failed to sufficiently explain its decisions, revealing an unfortunate arrogance and obtuseness.Justice Samuel Alito hascomplained about those who criticizethe court over the rushed, unexplained decisions on its emergency docket. Critics have faulted the court for issuing too many orders through that docket, which uses abbreviated procedures to issue orders that remain in force while the courts adjudicate whether Trump’s actions are legal. Alito maintains that with the crush of cases, thecourt doesn’t have the timeto write its usual, carefully wrought decisions.Alito has suggested, rather outrageously, that many critics of the court are engaged in improper bullying. He said that some critics of the emergency docket suggest it has been “captured by a dangerous cabal” that uses “sneaky” methods. Those criticisms, Alito warned, fuel “unprecedented efforts to intimidate the court”.When the court issues one order after another that favors Trump, the most lawless president in US history, often without explanation, the court should expect to be criticized for doing too little to defend our democracy and the rule of law. Alito shouldn’t be so thin-skinned or paranoid about supposed intimidation; he does have life tenure.The court’s critics aren’t seeking to intimidate the justices. Rather they are pleading with the rightwing supermajority to stop bowing to Trump and become more resolute in enforcing the law against the most authoritarian president in history, a president who said he could “terminate” parts of the constitution and who claims sweeping powersto singlehandedly nullify laws.The court’s supermajority should remember: we are supposed to have a government of laws, not of strongmen.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS educationcommentShareReuse this content"

So it’s a unique moment when he comes close – I emphasize the qualifier –to conceding that another leader has outfoxed him. Trump suggested as much recently when characterizing Vladimir Putin’s modus operandi. “Putin,” hetoldreporters on 13 July, “really surprised a lot of people. He talks nice and then bombs everybody in the evening.” Melania Trump may have contributed to this reassessment. As Trump recounted recently, when he told her about a “wonderful conversation” with the Russian leader, sheresponded, “Oh, really? Another city was just hit.”Trump’s new take on Putin is a break with the past. His esteem for Putin – whose decisions he hasdescribedas “savvy” and “genius” – has contrasted starkly with hisderisive commentsabout the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom he memorablydisrespectedduring a White House meeting and evenblamedfor starting the war.As recently as February, hedeclaredthat Russia’s invasion didn’t matter to the United States because, unlike Europe, it was separated from Ukraine by “a big, big beautiful ocean”. HecriticizedJoe Biden’s assistance to Ukraine as a waste of taxpayers’ money.Now, Trump has not only changed his view of Putin,stunningmany within his “America First” MagaA movement; he’s decided to start arming Ukraine. Well, sort of.Trump has gone beyond in effect conceding that Putin has played him. He has decided to sell military equipment to individual European countries so that they can supply Ukraine and restock their arsenals with purchases from the United States. The president formally announced the change during his 14 Julymeeting withMark Rutte, Nato’s secretary general.There was more. Trump warned Putin that if he did not accept a ceasefire – which he has steadfastly refused, just as he has ignored Trump’s demand to stop bombing Ukraine’s cities – within 50 days, Russia would be slammed with tariffs as high as100%, as would countries that continued to trade with it after the deadline.Two things are clear. First, Trump’s perspective on Putin has changed, unexpectedly and dramatically. Second, a war that Trump once said was none of America’s business now apparently matters. The president said European countries would buy “top of the line” American military equipment worth “billions of dollars” to arm Ukraine. According toone reportciting “a source familiar with the plan”, the total will be $10bn.This all sounds like a very big deal. But here’s where it becomes important to go beyond the headlines and soundbites and delve into the details.Take the $10bn figure. That’s certainly not chump change. Moreover, the main piece of equipment specified so far, thePatriot“long range, high altitude, all weather” missile defense system, will provide desperately needed relief to Ukrainian city dwellers, who have endured relentless waves of drone attacks –several hundreda night – followed by missiles that slice through overwhelmed defenses. Ukraine has some Patriots but needs more: it’s a vast country with a dozen cities whose populations exceed 400,000.However, a Patriot battery (launchers, missiles, a radar system, a control center, antenna masts, and a power generator) costs$1bn, the missiles alone $4m apiece. Ukraine may not need 10 Patriot batteries, but even a smaller number will consume a large proportion of the $10bn package. The other system that has been mentioned is the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (Jassm), which combines stealth technology and GPS guidance with a 230-mile range. Ukraine will be able to use its American-made F-16 jets to fire Jassms into Russia from positions beyond the reach of Russian air defense systems. But a single Jassm costs about$1.5m, so the costs will add up quickly. Additional items have been mentioned but only generically; still, their price must also be figured in, bearing in mind that the war could drag on. So, $10bn could be depleted quickly.Moreover, beyond a certain point the US cannot sell equipment from its own stocks without regard to its military readiness requirements. Precisely for that reason, the defense department recentlydeclinedto send Ukraine some of the equipment promised under Joe Biden.And Trump has not said that there will be follow-on sales to benefit Ukraine once the $10bn mark is reached. Even if he were to change his mind, individual European countries would be able to buy only so much American weaponry without straining their finances, especially because France and Italy haveopted outof the arrangement.Trump has been uninterestedin joining the recent move by the UK and the EU to impose a $47.60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil sales, toughening the $60 limit the west enacted in 2022. Finally, Trump isn’t going to resume Biden’s multibillion-dollar military assistance packages – 70-plus tranches of equipment, according to theDoD.Trump’s 50-day tariff deadline permits Putin to continue his summer offensive, and may even provide an incentive to accelerate it. Russia has already shrugged off Trump’s tariff threat. Its exports to the US in 2024 amounted to$526m, a tiny fraction of its global sales.By contrast, Trump’s secondary tariffs will hurt Russia, which earned$192bnin 2024 from its global exports of oil and related products, much of that sum fromIndia and China. If the president follows through with his threat, Beijing will surely retaliate, and the consequence will be painful: the United States exports to China totaled$144bnlast year. Will Trump proceed anyway, and during his ongoing trade wars, which have already started increasingpricesin the US? His track record on tariff threats leaves room for doubt.Ukraine’s leaders are understandably elated by Trump’s reappraisal of Putin. But it’s premature to conclude that it’s a turning point that could change the war’s trajectory. Washington’s new policy may prove far less momentous than Maga critics fear and not quite as transformative as Kyiv and its western supporters hope for.Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace StudiesExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionDonald TrumpVladimir PutinRussiaEuropeUS politicsUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s howDustin GuastellaDemocrats need to win back the working class in 2028. Our research shows what does and doesn’t workTue 22 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Jul 2025 14.52 EDTShareTo win in 2028, Democrats need to win back a lot of working-class voters, including a lot of blue-collar Donald Trump voters. Doing so requires dispensing with some long-held myths that have captured the minds of Democratic party strategists. The first is that persuading working-class Trump supporters isa waste of time. They are – so the story goes – so totally absorbed in Magaland that there is no winning them back. Why bother? On the flip side, some liberals insist that some of these voters are winnable, if only Democrats can make themselves more like Trump by embracing tax cuts andtough talk. A third notion, favored by progressives, says that if liberals just crank the progressiveeconomicmessage up to 11, blue-collar voters will come running home.The truth is, none of these strategies are particularly useful. Because none of them take working-class interests, values and attitudes seriously enough. Fortunately, new research from theCenter for Working-Class Politics (CWCP)can help shed light on what working-class voters actually want. And it can offer the Democrats a path out of the wilderness.In areport published by Jacobin magazine, we analyzed working-class responses to 128 survey questions from academic surveys stretching back to 1960. We looked at class attitudes toward major topics like immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, civil rights, social norms and economic policies. The result is the most sophisticated, comprehensive and up-to-date portrait of American working-class social and economic attitudes available. And it provides the best evidence yet for the potential of a certain kind of populist politics.Are non-voters the key to Democrats winning in 2028? | Alex Bronzini-VenderRead moreOur work shows that working-class voters are, and have always been, decidedly less progressive than their middle- and upper-class counterparts when it comes to social and cultural issues. But the story is more complicated than it seems. It’s not the case, for instance, that blue-collar workers are becoming more socially conservative. Instead of a rising tide of reaction, we show that working-class attitudes have actually drifted slowly toward more socially and culturally liberal positions over decades. At the same time, however, middle- and upper-class Americans have raced toward uber-liberalism, especially in recent years, opening up a yawning class gap on social attitudes. A first step to winning back workers is closing that gap.On the economic front, the situation is different. Most working-class voters are what we call “economic egalitarians” – they favor government interventions to level the playing field, they take inequality seriously, and they support programs that increase the economic and social power of working people. Large majorities favor raising the minimum wage, import limits to protect jobs, increasing spending on social security and Medicare, using federal power to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, expanding federal funding for public schools, making it easier to join a union, increasing infrastructure spending, implementing a millionaires’ tax, and even the notion of a job guarantee. Luckily forDemocrats, middle- and upper-class voters have drifted to the left on many of these economic issues, embracing a more social democratic outlook. That bodes well for developing an economic platform that can appeal to the broadest electoral coalition. Yet there is an important caveat here. While working-class voters are strongly in support of a range of progressive measures, they are wary of big new government programs, skeptical of new regulations and broadly suspicious of welfare spending. Their economic progressivism is jobs-centered and pro-worker, not built around cash transfers and expansive social services.So working-class voters are more socially moderate than the middle- and upper-class voters that make up the Democratic party’s core support. Yet they are also broadly economic egalitarians – on some questions even more so than their well-educated and well-heeled counterparts. They agree with a populist economic agenda but not an excessively liberal cultural one. The path to winning them back, and stitching together a majority, then, is clear: adopt social populism. Embrace working-class social and cultural attitudes and a worker-focused economic program that promises to raise the minimum wage, protect industrial jobs from free trade, increase infrastructure spending, expand social security, strengthen Medicare and guarantee full employment.And what about blue-collar Trump voters? After analyzing the broad working class we tried to find just how many Trump-voting workers might be won over by that kind of program. In fact, a lot of them hold progressive views across a range of economic issues. We found that “over 20% of working-class Trump voters were in favor of an economic policy package that included increasing federal funding for public schools, increasing federal funding for social security, and increasing the minimum wage.” Of course, many of these same voters have such conservative views on social issues that they would never vote for a Democrat. But are there any working-class populists in the Trump coalition who hold socially moderate attitudes? There are.Eleven per cent of them, to be exact.We found that about 11% of Trump voters maintained socially moderateandeconomically egalitarian views.Now, that may not sound like a lot, but it’s a significant slice of the electorate, comprising about 5% of the total. No Democrat could win all of those voters. But given that these are working-class voters, many of whom are concentrated in swing states, each single vote has tremendous electoral value. In fact, even winning half of these voters – a little more than 2% of the electorate – would be significant enough to sway a national election in our age of razor-thin vote margins. Moreover, it could set the Democrats on the path to a more durable majority in the future.Given all this we can put to bed the various myths about working-class voters – that they are bigots, hardened reactionaries, hopelessly unwinnable, etc – and instead embrace a strategy that can win. With the right kind of candidate (preferably aworking-class one) and the right kind of political message, Democrats can win back a working-class majority.The evidence is clear: it’s social populism or bust.Dustin Guastella is director of operations for Teamsters Local 623 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and a research associate at the Center for Working-Class PoliticsExplore more on these topicsUS politicsHow can Democrats win?DemocratscommentShareReuse this content"

So unfair.Thankfully, the daughter of Covid hero Captain Sir Tom Moore, who raised £39m for NHS charities by walking 100 laps of his garden in April 2020, still has love and kindness in her heart despite all this. So much so, in fact, that she’s generously sharing it with the rest of us.For instance: “It’s easy to waste energy worrying about things you can’t control. But here’s the truth – your power lies in how you steady yourself.” Or how about: “When life feels uncertain, which it so often does, let’s lead with kindness. It’s the one thing we never run out of.” And the sort of advice that’s so hard to come by online: “Trust your instinct, you know more than you think.”Yes, in a parable for our times, Ingram-Moore has reinvented herself as aTikTok resilience coach. The 54-year-old is doling out daily mantras that she calls “Moore moments” – which is her name and definitely not another example of using her dad for potential commercial gain. There’s a podcast, too, in which she interviews people about “reinvention, resilience, grief, leadership, legacy, pressure and hope” with “more than a touch of British warmth” – on perfect display when she oh-so warmlyasks one woman“tell us about the horror of the time when your mum was shot during a robbery”.View image in fullscreenIn her podcast, she interviews people about ‘reinvention, resilience, grief, leadership, legacy, pressure and hope’.Photograph: Hannah Ingram-Moore/YouTubeAnyway, the TikTok “moments” are delivered in bite-size selfie-style videos, in which Ingram-Moore clearly hasn’t spent time worrying about trying to control the background noise, or thinking about using her power to steady the camerawork. In one, she’s apparently been struck by a flash of inspirationwhile going up an escalatorand had to deliver her wisdom there and then to her audience of 10.7k, who are definitely not hate-following.As apparent “grifter to guru” narratives go, it’s not so far from the sort of spiritual influencers who use the internet to preach joy and self-reflection, while simultaneously building a personal brand. And if you’re thinking, “hang on, I thought Captain Sir Tom’s daughter had been cancelled”, then you’re woefully behind on cancellation culture which, as things stand, seems to mean a few months of criticism before you can forge a new career on the back of all that notoriety and try to connect authentically to the same general public you previously let down.Or, as Ingram-Moore says: “No one is you and that is your power. You are still writing your story so don’t stop now.”Unfortunately for her, the Charity Commission has finished writing its damning report into Ingram-Moore and her husband, Colin. Itpublished the results of its investigationin November last year and found the family had personally benefited from the Captain Tom Foundation, with “serious and repeated” instances of misconduct and mismanagement, as well as “misleading” the public. Ingram-Moorecalled it “selective storytelling”and said the commission had a “predetermined agenda”.View image in fullscreenHannah Ingram-Moore with her late father, Captain Tom Moore, 30 April 2020.Photograph: Emma Sohl/Capture the Light Photography/PA“The last few years have tested me. The criticism, the judgment, the noise, but here is what I have learned,” she said in one recent TikTok. “Self-doubt gets louder when you’re under pressure. Confidence – that comes from keeping going quietly, consistently, even when people doubt you.”To be fair, she knows of what she speaks. As Ingram-Moore says on her website, advertising her skills as a resilience leader, philanthropist and public speaker (fees on request), she’s “lived it” and can help others with how to “rebuild trust, control your narrative and emerge stronger” after reputational damage.Certainly, she might prefer that to some of the comments left below the line on her self-help videos. “Can you give me advice on how to financially benefit from a charity I’ve set up in honour of a family member please?” says one. “Can you recommend someone who can build an extension?” asks another.“You are ridiculous and ignorant,” is her standard reply. “FACT CHECK: £38.9m went entirely to NHS charities.” As Ingram-Moore puts it: “You don’t have to prove them wrong, you just have to believe in yourself and trust your truth.” Now that’s resilience in action.Claire Cohen is a journalist and the author of BFF?

Air conditioning and heating systems can lower the humidity levels in the air, which can lead to increased “transepidermal water loss”. “That’s where you’re losing moisture through your skin,” Willems says. “This can result in having drier, tighter or flakier skin, and this is particularly exacerbated in people who are prone to conditions such as eczema or have underlying sensitive skin.”Dr Pooja Kadam, a dermatologist at The Skin Hospital in Sydney, agrees office air may reduce humidity and cause dry skin, which may then trigger inflammatory skin conditions such as acne or dermatitis. And when it comes to hair, “when the scalp is dry your body may produce extra sebum [oil] to compensate, leading to a greasy look”.What other factors are at play?Office environments might also have poor ventilation, Willems says. This can lead to increased concentration of indoor air pollutants that can irritate the skin, such as dust or what are known as VOCs (volatile organic compounds), which can come from newly manufactured objects such as carpets, curtains and furniture, as well as certain cleaning products.Dr Libby Sander, an associate professor of organisational behaviour at Bond University, says other symptoms of poor indoor air quality may not be visible, withstudies showing it may also affect cognition, performance as well as cause respiratory issues, headaches and sleep.Factors independent of the physical office environment could also be at play, Willems says. For example, people might sweat more when they’re outside their home environment, which might make their hair look limp. Also, the stages of a commute into work – walking to a station, being on a train, then walking to the office – can expose the skin to possible triggers for irritation, and the movement back and forth between hot and cold environments can itself be a source of irritation.Should offices be better designed?Not everyone’s hair and skin will be affected by office air, and concerns will be more likely in susceptible individuals such as those with sensitive skin. Willems says things like humidifiers are not always effective and can instead bevectors for infection. However, she encourages people to have a discussion with their employer about what a healthy work environment looks like.Can adult tummy time undo the dreaded ‘tech neck’ from hunching over a screen? | AntiviralRead more“We often talk about the skin being a mirror to health within the body, and so we want to be creating a work environment that not just looks after skin health, but also looks after whole body wellbeing.”What can you do if you’re worried?Sander says office indoor air quality is unfortunately not something that an employee is always able to control. However, they can ask facilities and human resources managers questions such as “What is the rating of our building? Is it aLeed certifiedbuilding? Is it aWell certifiedbuilding? Because we know that there is significant research linking that to a range of physical and cognitive outcomes.”When it comes to the potential impact on people’s appearance, Willems says people should focus on good skincare and trying to avoid irritants. A good-quality moisturiser is a great place to start, especially one that contains ingredients such as ceramides, which are naturally occurring fats found in the skin. These help seal in moisture and restore the skin barrier to keep irritants out.To boost hydration further, humectants such as hyaluronic acid can be helpful. These “essentially draw water into the skin, making it act like a sponge to plump the skin and boost hydration,” Willems says. Products that support skin repair, such as those containing niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3) can also soothe and strengthen the skin over time. Sunscreen is important too, as UV exposure can trigger irritation. Willems adds that using a gentle cleanser is key, because harsh exfoliants on already irritated skin will only make things worse.Antiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

A seven-month-old baby lies in our paediatric intensive care unit, so tiny and malnourished that I initially mistook her for a newborn. The phrase “skin and bones” doesn’t do justice to the way her body has been ravaged. She is literally wasting away before our eyes and, despite our best efforts, we are powerless to save her. We are witnessing deliberate starvation in Gaza right now.This is my third time in Gaza since December 2023 as a volunteer surgeon withMedical Aid for Palestinians. I experienced mass casualty events and raised the alarm about malnutritionback in January 2024. But nothing has prepared me for the sheer horror I’m witnessing now: the weaponisation of starvation against an entire population.The malnutrition crisis has become catastrophic since my last visit. Every day I watch patients deteriorate and die, not from their injuries, but because they are too malnourished to survive surgery. The surgical repairs that we carry out fall to pieces, patients get terrible infections, then they die. It is happening repeatedly, and it is heartbreaking to watch. Four babies have died in the last few weeks in this hospital – not from bombs or bullets, but from starvation.Families and staff do their best to try to bring in what they can, but there simply isn’t enough food available in Gaza. For infants, we have virtually no baby formula. Children are being given 10% dextrose (sugar water), which has no nutritional value, and often their mothers are too malnourished to breastfeed. When an international colleague tried to bring baby formula into Gaza,Israeli authorities confiscated it.Benjamin Netanyahu’s approach is twofold: block food from entering Gaza while leaving desperate civilians no choice but to visit militarised distribution points to receive some limited supplies. Until May, Gaza had more than 400 aid distribution sites where people could access food safely. Now there are just four of these militarised zones in the south where starving families are in constant danger of attack.1:33Palestinians mourn people killed while waiting for food near Rafah aid centre – videoI’m hearing about dozens of trauma casualties flooding Gaza’s emergency departments daily – many of them with gunshot wounds from these militarised distribution points. I have operated on boys aged 12 to 15, whose relatives say they were shot while trying to get food for their families. Last week a 12-year-old died on the operating table, shot through the abdomen at what can only be described as a death trap for those seeking basic sustenance.My colleagues in the emergency department have also reported a disturbing pattern: injuries concentrated on specific body parts on different days – heads, legs, genitals – suggesting deliberate targeting of those body parts.In recent days, I operated on two women who were shot byquadcopterswhile sheltering in their tents near one of the locations, according to the people who brought them in. One was breastfeeding her child when she was hit; the second was pregnant. Thankfully, both have survived their injuries so far. These women weren’t even seeking aid – they were simply sheltering in areas that are supposedly “safe” but exposed to indiscriminate fire from the IDF’s weaponised hunger apparatus.It is not just the patients here who are malnourished, but also healthcare workers. When I first arrived, I barely recognised colleagues I had worked with last year – some had lost 30kg. At lunchtime, some doctors and nurses head towards the distribution sites, knowing they risk death but having no choice if they want to feed their families.Nasser hospital is the last major functioning hospital in southern Gaza, but we’re operating at breaking point, reeling fromprevious attacksand overwhelmed by mass casualties, all while facing shortages of everything. Netanyahu’s systematic destruction of Gaza’s healthcare system has funnelled desperate medical needs into this single facility while directly targeting healthcare workers and patients. Just this week, one of our dear theatre nurses was killed in his tent along with his three small children.In Gaza I saw the suffering of children and the heroism of health workers trying to save them | Thienminh DinhRead moreI want to be clear – what is being done to Palestinians in Gaza is barbaric and entirely preventable. I cannot believe we have come to a point where the world is watching as the people of Gaza are forced to endure starvation and gunfire, all while food and medical aid sits across the border just miles away from them.The enforced malnutrition and attacks on civilians will kill thousands more if not stopped immediately. Every day of inaction means more children will die not just from bullets or bombs, but from hunger. A permanent ceasefire, the free and safe flow of aid through the UN-led system, and the lifting of the blockade are needed now – and all can be achieved with political will.The UK government’s continued complicity in Israel’s atrocities is unconscionable, and I do not want to spend another day operating on children who have been shot and starved by a military our government supports. History will judge not just those who committed these crimes, but those who stood by and watched.From inside Nasser hospital, I am telling you: this is deliberate. This is preventable. And this must stop now.Prof Nick Maynard is a consultant surgeon at Oxford university hospital who has been travelling regularly to Gaza for 15 years.

Why do people assume I only know about war and tragedy?Ana SchnablReaders lose out when English-speaking gatekeepers decide what books are sold and whose stories get toldTue 22 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Jul 2025 09.12 EDTShareIattended an American writers’ conference in Texas, just before the world plunged into Covid-19 lockdowns. Between panels and networking, I spent my time wandering around the book fair, leafing through titles and peppering publishers with questions.“How many translated works are in your catalogues? How do you discover authors from outside the US? And how do you evaluate the quality of writing in languages you don’t speak?”I wasn’t just curious – I was on a mission. I wanted to know what kind of work appealed to American publishers and whether mine might catch their interest. I didn’t bother hiding my ambition.One response has stayed with me, lodged in my mind like a spore. It came from a representative of one of the largest US publishing houses. After I explained where I was from, using buzzwords like “former Yugoslavia’s northern republic” and “not a war zone at the moment”, he offered this piece of advice:“Think about stories and themes specific to your culture and the history of the place.”“So,” I ventured, “not a story about, say, a woman who leaves her career in finance, divorces her husband, and becomes a potter?”“Well, if that story also explored your cultural or historical issues, then yes.”I felt a prick of annoyance but thanked him politely and walked away. A coffee and cigarette suddenly felt essential.In the years since, I’ve come to understand why his words irritated me so much. They exposed a pattern – one that still frustrates me.For authors from the Balkans, and other European nations and countries worldwide whose history and culture are a mystery to North Americans, the road to being translated into English and published by US or British publishers often depends on meeting one unspoken condition: our work must present our region’s political or cultural context, or at least draw from pivotal historic events. To succeed, it must have explanatory or illustrative value – ideally with a dash of didacticism.“American readers need to learn about the place,” the publisher had said.At first glance, this expectation seems benign – reasonable, even. After all, authors everywhere, including those from the Balkans, reflect on their immediate political and cultural surroundings. Literature has always been a medium for mirroring, analysing and critiquing society.But the deeper implication of this expectation is more troubling. It rests on a tacit belief that the Balkans is a lesser place – a region forever simmering with potential for tragedy. As the publisher candidly put it: “Tackling something culturally or historically problematic – or better, traumatic – would be of interest.”By “traumatic”, was he imagining the atrocities of the second world war or theYugoslav wars?Was he picturing a region mired in poverty, inequality and patriarchal traditions? Perhaps he assumed Balkan societies are uniquely prone to violence or sadness. Maybe he hoped for stories of post-socialist disillusionment, perpetuating the notion that we’re still processing the “trauma” of Yugoslav socialism.I can’t say for sure. What I do know is this: he wouldn’t have been interested in a Balkan version ofMy Year of Rest and Relaxation. A novel about a protagonist from the Balkans who’s simply exhausted by capitalism, self-absorbed, angry or morally ambiguous would fail to tick the right boxes.Sadly for him, he probably would have glossed over thehybrid novelby Slovenian writer Nataša Kramberger, who took over a farm in Slovenian Styria, after moving back from Berlin. And I suspect he wouldn’t care much for the short stories of the CroatianLuiza Bouharaoua, which paint the angst and joys of millennials, albeit in the colours of the Adriatic. Nor for the poetry of the North Macedonian poetKalia Dimitrova, who likes to refer to Capri and Berlin but seldom to Skopje.For a work by a Balkan author to succeed, its protagonist must be a victim – a clear and unambiguous one. Publishers prefer stories that elicit compassion, moral indignation, heartbreak or, ideally, all three.In short, we Balkan writers are expected to approach universal themes – grief, alienation, love, loss – through a narrowly regional lens. And that lens must include a self-exoticising twist.To be clear, the Balkans is a specific region with unique cultural, political and historical complexities. Writers from this part of the world have much to say about these, and many do so brilliantly. But if translations into English are meant to expand knowledge about “that Balkan place”, publishers must be willing to engage with stories that challenge established perceptions.The question isn’t whether Balkan writers should reflect their context. We often do, naturally. The question is whether publishers will listen to the diversity of voices emerging from the region – or if they’ll keep privileging narratives that neatly reinforce their assumptions.After all, there’s much more to the Balkans than trauma, tragedy or tales tailored to teach. There are also just exceptionally written stories about women who once worked in finance, left their husbands and opened a pottery business. Some North American and UK publishers have already supported such stories fully – henceGeorgi Gospodinov’s International Booker award– and have thereby fulfilled the mission to bring voices from diverse corners of the world to a global audience, not as ambassadors of their geography but as storytellers in their own right. But many more have yet to do so.Ana Schnabl is a Slovenian novelist, editor and criticExplore more on these topicsPublishingOpinionCroatiaSloveniaEuropeBooker prizeNorth MacedoniaAwards and prizescommentShareReuse this content"

And every time, we fail to address the question of whether we are prepared as a nation; in my opinion, the answer is no.It’s not that I’m philosophically opposed to enfranchising 16‑ and 17‑year‑olds. After all, democracy thrives on fresh voices. The hitch comes when you hand a driving licence to someone who has never sat behind a wheel. Without robust civic and media‑literacy education, and without any clear evidence that 16- and 17-year‑olds themselves demand this change, we’d be giving young Australians an Ikea flat‑pack democracy with no instruction manual.‘There’s an us v them mentality’: are young Australian men and women drifting apart politically?Read moreI won’t dignify the cognitive capability argument against lowering voting age – sharp minds exist among teens as well of course. But readinessis another matter. Internal efficacy – belief in one’s ability to effect change – runs low: in theAustralian National University Generation studyof 3,131 16- and 17-year-old Australians, just 3.5% backed a lowered compulsory vote, 18% wanted a voluntary ballot and more than 70% favoured keeping the voting age at 18. This mirrored past statistics amongolder voting youthand the overall voting public – highlighting public reluctance for lowering voting age. This lack of confidence isn’t surprising when earlier this year, school students have recorded theirlowestcivic‑knowledge scores in two decades, and 47% of gen Z voters said theirmain motivationfor casting a ballot in 2022 was avoiding a $20 fine, not civic conviction.Thinking about where they get their information from, social media reigns supreme when it comes to news consumption. Forty per cent of 18-to-24-year‑olds get news on Instagram and 36% on TikTok, yet only 24% of all Australians have had news‑literacy training, according to the2025 Digital News Report. Given this fragmented media landscape where politicalmisinformationis rife andAI chatbotsare increasingly asked to provide tailored news, any notion of voluntary voting – or haphazard enfranchisement – is nonsense unless we first mandate robust civics and media‑literacy education.Independent MP Monique Ryan’s proposal of thefallback optionof voluntary voting for 16‑ and 17‑year‑olds risks tampering with what ties our young people to the democratic system. If we waive fines for teen no‑shows, we’ll replace steady turnout with shrugging indifference (precisely the problem our UK counterparts aretrying to solve).In Australia, state-initiated registration and mandatory voting keep our youngest cohorts turning up in significantly higher numbers than in most democracies. In myPhD researchacross 35 OECD nations, these were the most important electoral design features that drive youth participation, not voting age. Removing them now would be a step backwards, not forwards.Now let’s talk party politics. Young voters today are no monolithic bloc but a fractured constellation of issue‑driven minds. Election analyses show 18-to-29-year‑olds are more likely to switch allegiances mid‑campaign and toabandonmajor parties altogether. Ryan’s bid to lower the voting age makes political sense: gen Z are alreadydrifting towardsindependents and minor parties such as the Greens more than their predecessors, the millennials.So in practice, any voting‑age reform will likely remain a partisan tug‑of‑war rather than a matter of democratic principle. The Greens have beenpushingto extend the franchise to 16‑ and 17‑year‑olds, arguing it would amplify youth voices in policymaking (even though enfranchised younger voters todayremainpoorly represented in policy outcomes than their parents). Labor fears that a younger, more progressive electorate would hand the Greens an entrenched advantage – and that voluntary voting for teens could undermine Australia’s compulsory model. The Coalition seems wary that any electoral tweak is likely toadvantage the left.Lowering the voting age: a boost for UK democracy or a shot in the dark?Read moreViewed this way, lowering the voting age looks less like principled reform and more like partisan manoeuvring – although injecting a small new cohort is unlikely to upend the broad electoral currents already in motion.Lowering the voting age certainly won’t magically bridge thetrust gapbetween young Australians and their representatives. Unless we first diagnose why so many youths distrust politicians, simply adding unprepared 16‑ and 17‑year‑olds to the roll risks token turnout or – under a voluntary scheme – a surge in protest abstention. The solution isn’t a standalone ballot‑box fix but a two‑pronged approach (while maintaining compulsory voting): first we must invest in compulsory civics, media and digital‑literacy education across our secondary schools, and only then can we negotiate lowering voting age.Perhaps the moment is ripe to roll out these reforms in tandem. I’ll leave it to Ryan, the Greens and the ALP to whatever mix of electoral legacy‑building or genuine youth advocacy they pursue – but I remain unconvinced that enfranchising new voters without fortifying their civic foundations is anything but misguided, if not downright harmful.Dr Intifar Chowdhury is a youth researcher and a lecturer in government at Flinders UniversityExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionAustralian mediaLaw (Australia)Australian GreensLabor partyCoalitioncommentShareReuse this content"

He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.” No cause of death was given, though Osbourne had experienced various forms of ill health in recent years.Osbourne was one of the most notorious figures in rock: an innovator whose eerie wail helped usher in heavy metal, a showman who once bit the head off a bat on stage, an addict whose substance abuse led him to attempt to murder his wife, and latterly, a reality TV star much loved for his bemusement at family life on The Osbournes.His death comes less than three weeks after his retirement from performance. On 5 July, Osbourne reunited with his original bandmates in the pioneering group Black Sabbath for the first time since 2005, forBack to the Beginning: an all-star farewell concert featuring some of the biggest names in metal. “I’ve been laid up for six years, and you’ve got no idea how I feel,” he told the crowd that night, referring to extensive health issues including a form of Parkinson’s and numerous surgeries on his spine. “Thank you from the bottom of my heart.”He was born John Michael Osbourne in Aston, Birmingham, in 1948, the son of a pair of factory workers. He had a tough upbringing. As well as living in relative poverty, aged 11 he was repeatedly sexually abused by two boys: “It was terrible … It seemed to go on for ever,” he told the Mirrorin 2003. He was also jailed for burglary: “I was no good at that. Fucking useless,”he admitted in 2014.3:27Ozzy Osbourne, icon of British heavy metal, dies aged 76 – video obituaryThis industrial working-class environment fed into the sound of Osbourne’s defining musical project, Black Sabbath, whose heavy sound revolutionised British rock music. “We wanted to put how we thought about the world at the time,” the band’s bassist, Geezer Butler, said in 2017. “We didn’t want to write happy pop songs. We gave that industrial feeling to it.”View image in fullscreenBlack Sabbath in the 70s … from left, Geezer Butler, Tony Iommi, Bill Ward and Ozzy Osbourne.Photograph: Chris Walter/WireImageNamed after a Boris Karloff horror movie, the band, also featuring Tony Iommi on guitar and Bill Ward on drums, released their self-titled debut in 1970, followed by further albums regarded as foundation stones of the heavy-metal genre. Paranoid (1970) featured the strutting anthems Iron Man and War Pigs and topped the UK album chart, while the cacophonous, psychedelic sound of Master of Reality (1971) remains a huge influence on the slower sound of doom metal.Osbourne recorded a further five acclaimed albums with the group, but became so dependent on alcohol and drugs that he was fired in 1979, and replaced by Ronnie James Dio. Osbourne eventually returned to the band for the 2013 album 13, which topped the charts in the US and UK. Black Sabbath also went on tour, playing what was billed as their final concert in Birmingham on 4 February 2017, prior to their 2025 reunion gig.Osbourne went solo shortly after leaving Black Sabbath, and beginning with 1980’s Blizzard of Ozz – which went five times platinum in the US – released 13 studio albums, the most recent being 2022’s Patient Number 9.The most notorious incident involving Osbourne happened in 1982, when he bit off the head of a dead bat he believed to be a stage prop while performing in Des Moines, Iowa. He later went to hospital to receive a precautionary rabies inoculation. He also claimed – and this was corroborated by his one-time publicist Mick Wall – to have bitten the heads off two doves during a 1981 record label meeting that went sour, having originally intended to release the birds as a sign of peace.In the 80s and 90s, he had occasional UK Top 40 hits, including Bark at the Moon (1983) and Perry Mason (1995). He eventually hit No 1 in 2003 with Changes, a duet with his daughter Kelly, 40.View image in fullscreenOzzy Osbourne and Sharon Osbourne pictured in 2014.Photograph: Dave Hogan/MTV 2014/Getty ImagesOsbourne has two other children with wife Sharon – Jack, 39, and Aimee, 41 – and two with first wife, Thelma – Jessica and Louis. His marriage to Thelma had deteriorated because of his alcoholism, and he later admitted he couldn’t remember Jessica and Louis being born.In 1982, he married Sharon, who had begun managing his solo career after the pair met three years earlier. Her business acumen paired with his enduring popularity helped them accrue huge wealth. Ozzfest, the metal music festival founded by Sharon in 1996, toured the US most years and also had outings in the UK and Japan.In 1989, he was arrested for attempting to murder Sharon by strangling her while drunk. He recounted the incident ina 2007 interview: “I woke up in this little single cell with human shit up the walls – and I thought, ‘What the fuck have I done now?’ … [A police officer] read me a piece of paper, and said, ‘You’re charged with attempting to murder Mrs Sharon Osbourne.’ I can’t tell you how I felt. I just went numb.” The couple later reconciled, though briefly split again in 2016 after Ozzy was unfaithful with a hair stylist.Ozzy and Sharon, along with Kelly and Jack, appeared in the reality TV series The Osbournes from 2002 to 2005. A fly-on-the-wall documentary series that followed the family’s domestic life – complete with dog therapists, “vagina doctors” and an endless stream of imaginative bad language from everyone – it became a ratings hit, and, in 2002, the second ever winner of the Emmy award for outstanding reality programme.Ozzy broke his neck, collarbone and ribs in a quad biking accident at his Buckinghamshire homein 2003. Sharon later said he had stopped breathing for a minute and a half “and there was no pulse”; he was also told he was almost paralysed by the accident. In 2005, he was diagnosed with Parkin syndrome, which causes bodily tremors.In 2013, following years of sobriety, he admitted he had been drinking and taking drugs for a year and a half, but was committed to becoming sober again,saying: “I was in a very dark place and was an asshole to the people I love most, my family.”In 2019, Osbourne performed what was billed as his final world tour, entitled No More Tours 2. (He first announced his retirement in 1992 with the No More Tours tour, but later reversed his decision.) Illness forced him to postpone the European dates in 2020. “It just seems that since October, everything I touch has turned to shit,” he said in an apologetic statement – he had also spent time in hospital to receive treatment for an infection in his hand.In 2020 he announced he had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s, and in 2022 had surgery on his spine, having suffered a fall in 2019 that exacerbated the earlier quad biking injuries. In 2023, he cancelled a UK and Europe tour due to being “physically weak”, describing “three operations, stem cell treatments, endless physical therapy sessions, and most recently groundbreaking Cybernics (HAL) treatment.”View image in fullscreenOzzy Osbourne on stage at Back to the Beginning, 5 July.Photograph: Ross HalfinOsbourne became depressed amid the extensive treatment, as he described in a May 2025 interview with the Guardian. “You wake up the next morning and find that something else has gone wrong. You begin to think this is never going to end,” he said. “Sharon could see that I was in Doom Town, and she says to me, ‘I’ve got an idea.’ It was something to give me a reason to get up in the morning.”This was the Back to the Beginning concert held at Villa Park in Birmingham, which saw Osbourne reunite with Butler, Iommi and Ward for a four-song set, after a five-song solo set. Osbourne performed seated in a bat-adorned throne, but put in a spirited performance, telling the audience at one point: “I am Iron Man: go fucking crazy!” The concert also featured performances by legends including Metallica, Slayer and Guns N’ Roses.Elton John was among those paying tribute to Osbourne, writing: “He was a dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods – a true legend. He was also one of the funniest people I’ve ever met. I will miss him dearly.”Explore more on these topicsOzzy OsbourneMetalSharon OsbournePop and rockReality TVTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

His childhood had been troubled – he struggled at school, partly as a result of dyslexia, and suffered sexual abuse at the hands of two older bullies – and his prospects after leaving school aged 15 seemed non-existent. Even his attempts to become a criminal ended in farce. He was, he later noted, “fucking useless” as a burglar: a television he was attempting to steal fell on top of him; operating in the dark, he inadvertently stole a selection of baby clothes rather than the adult garments he had intended to sell around the pubs of his native Aston in Birmingham. Finally, he was caught and sent to prison for six weeks.“OZZY ZIG NEEDS A GIG” read the card he left in the window of a local music shop, and “need” seems to have been the operative word: by the time he joined a heavy blues rock band called Earth as vocalist, he was out of other options. It wasn’t even as if Earth, or Black Sabbath as they became, offered an obvious ticket to fame and fortune: their big idea to advance their career involved loading their van up with equipment, then driving it to other artists’ gigs uninvited, sitting outside on the off-chance that one of the bands performing pulled out and they could fill in.And when Osbourne opened his mouth to sing, you didn’t need to know about his dismal CV to realise life hadn’t dealt him a great hand. His voice was a desolate, unschooled wail, best suited to delivering songs that fitted the definition of rock’n’roll once offered by Dr Feelgood’s late frontman Lee Brilleaux: “Music about sod’s law and bad luck.”The creation myth of Black Sabbath – and therefore of heavy metal, the genre they more or less invented singlehanded – is that it was a brilliantly canny piece of branding on the part of drummer Bill Ward: if people queued up to see horror films, why not create a rock equivalent? Black Sabbath certainly arrived fully formed – every one of the musical elements that made them legendary is perfectly in place on the eponymous opening track of their eponymous 1970 debut album – but the music they came up with in response to Ward’s idea felt organic, not calculated. Black Sabbath sounded like a product of their environment: a grim, provincial, industrial world, where the drugs associated with the hippy counterculture had arrived, but not the freedoms or opportunities enjoyed by London’s bohemian elite. And they sounded like a product of their era. If one response to the end of the 60s party was to be found in the wistful, delicate morning-after melancholy of 1970’s biggest-selling album, Simon and Garfunkel’s Bridge Over Troubled Water, then Black Sabbath provided another: music that seemed as if it was lumbering angrily around with the kind of monstrous hangover that feels more like a nervous breakdown, suffused with dark thoughts, alienation, self-hatred and paranoia.Their debut still carried hints of the heavy blues band they had been – side two in particular sounds like a kind of curdled Cream – but by the time of 1970’s Paranoid, they had honed their style into something entirely unique. It was hugely successful – quadruple platinum in the US – but, as with every early Black Sabbath album, critically reviled in a way that now seems scarcely believable: “The worst of the counterculture on a plastic platter … bullshit … dull and decadent … dim-witted, amoral exploitation,” opined American writer Robert Christgau of the band. Their reception set the tone for the way heavy metal as a genre would be dismissed by “serious” rock critics for decades to come, but there was a curious sense in which it worked in Sabbath’s favour, turning them into the people’s band, who connected with a vast audience of disaffected teenagers (“the kid down the block … slumped in his bedroom gorged on Tuinal … finding justification for his cancerous apathy,” as one contemporary writer characterised their fans) without the aid of the media.3:27Ozzy Osbourne, icon of British heavy metal, dies aged 76 – video obituaryOsbourne bolstered that image himself. For all the dark mythology that surrounded the band – they seem to have spent a significant portion of the early 70s explaining to journalists that they weren’t actually satanists – he cut a curiously unstudied figure on stage. Watch the YouTube footage of the band performing at the California Jam festival in April 1974 and what’s striking is the disparity between the way they sound – monstrously heavy and dark – and the way Osbourne looks. No moody scowling or sullen posturing: he strips his shirt off, jumps up and down excitedly, claps along, raises his hands to the sky and waves his arms in delight. He behaves remarkably like a member of the audience who’s been allowed on stage and can’t quite believe his luck: in an era of rarefied rock gods preening, here was a rock star whose every move suggested he was just like you.View image in fullscreen‘A rock star whose every move suggested he was just like you’ … Osbourne performing at Lewisham Odeon, London, May 1978.Photograph: Gus Stewart/Getty ImagesThe California Jam footage arguably captures Black Sabbath at their peak. The following year, Sabotage brought to an end a run of virtually flawless albums: Paranoid, Master of Reality, Vol 4, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Osbourne considered leaving the band during the recording of 1976’s Technical Ecstasy, a confused attempt to expand their sound in the face of a changing musical climate – he toyed with starting a new band called Blizzard of Ozz – but instead found himself fired after the release of its underwhelming follow-up Never Say Die! His bandmates blamed drink and drug-related unreliability, Osbourne insisted that he was no more indulgent than the others. Whatever the truth, even Osbourne himself seemed to regard his sacking as the end of his musical career: he holed up in an LA hotel room, apparently intent on spending his severance pay on alcohol and drugs in the belief that “after this I’m going back to Birmingham and the dole”.He reckoned without the intervention of the formidable Sharon Levy, sent to LA by her father, Black Sabbath’s manager Don, to keep an eye on the singer. The pair not only became romantically involved, marrying in 1982, they proceeded to pull off a dramatic reinvention of Osbourne’s career, hinging on a happy accident and an inspired idea.View image in fullscreenCartoonish Prince of Darkness … Ozzy Osborne with a parakeet in his Beverly Hills home in March 1997.Photograph: Eddie Sanderson/Getty ImagesThe happy accident was Osbourne stumbling across a virtually unknown guitarist called Randy Rhoads. In Rhoads’ retelling of the story, Osbourne was so drunk at his audition that he hired him after only hearing him tune up. The inspired idea was to embrace the kind of negative attention that Black Sabbath had always attempted to dismiss. By the early 80s, heavy metal was a hugely successful musical genre. As its stock rose, so did the attention paid to the kind of lyrical themes that Black Sabbath had once specialised in. In the US in particular, rightwing conservatives and Christian fundamentalists created a mini-industry in taking self-evidently preposterous metal lyrics at face value and detecting inferences that were clearly completely unintentional. If heavy metal was now deemed an authentic threat to public morality rather than escapist entertainment, was Osbourne and Arden’s thinking, then the genre’s co-creator should be an embodiment of outrage.Out went the excitable frontman who was just like you. In cameOzzy Osbourne, cartoonish Prince of Darkness, who bit the head off a dove during a record company sales convention, then repeated the trick on stage in Des Moines, Iowa, this time with a live bat; took all his clothes off and dipped his testicles in a glass of wine at a dinner with his German label bosses; and urinated on the Alamo Cenotaph.It wasn’t entirely clear whether Osbourne himself was working to some brilliant self-publicising masterplan or just a raging alcoholic doing ridiculous things because he was pissed, but either way, the attendant controversy sent his popularity skyward, helped by the fact that his first two solo albums, 1980’s Blizzard of Ozz and 1981’s Diary of a Madman, were infinitely better records than anyone who had encountered Osbourne towards the end of his tenure with Sabbath would have believed he was capable of making. His voice was apparently unaffected by the abuse he visited upon his body. Rhoads was a lavishly gifted guitarist, his classical training – most obvious on Diary of a Madman’s title track – shifting his playing away from the blues-based style that had dominated hard rock in the 70s, presaging the way heavy metal would move in the 80s. The songs they came up with were more varied than the cartoon imagery would suggest: the most obvious influence on Goodbye to Romance was Osbourne’s beloved Beatles in their psychedelic prime.The albums and the outrage made Osbourne so famous as a solo star, he seemed weirdly impregnable. Nothing, it appeared, could dent his success. Not the death of Rhoads in a 1982 plane crash, nor the noticeable decline in quality of Osbourne’s albums – 1982’s pointless collection of re-recorded Black Sabbath songs Speak of the Devil, the full-bore glam metal of 1983’s Bark at the Moon – nor his increasing addiction problems. He sounded rejuvenated by the arrival of guitarist Zakk Wylde on 1988’s No Rest for the Wicked and 1991’s No More Tears, but in between was arrested for attempted murder after strangling his wife, Sharon, during a drink and drug binge.He subsequently emerged from rehab – his marriage, incredibly, still intact – but remained an uneven recording artist for the rest of his life. Genuinely great albums – including 2001’s underrated Down to Earth, reunited with Wylde and with a pre-Metallica Robert Trujillo on bass – shared space in his discography with wan efforts such as 1995’s hopelessly overproduced Ozzmosis, and stuff that lurked somewhere inbetween, a category in which you might reasonably place Black Sabbath’s Rick Rubin-produced reunion album 13. You could never have accused Osbourne of shying away from the unexpected, whether it was experimenting with Auto-Tune on 2022’s Patient Number 9, or offering up a remarkably faithful version of John Lennon’s distinctly soppy Woman on 2005’s Under Cover. Again, the mixed quality of his output did nothing to affect his standing. His celebrity was boosted by reality show The Osbournes, which elevated him to national treasure status, something it was hard to imagine happening in the years when his audience was held to be Tuinal-gorged losers scarred by the cancer of apathy. And perhaps more importantly, under Sharon Osbourne’s aegis, he fully embraced his Godfather ofMetaltag, presiding over the scores of younger artists who appeared at his annual Ozzfest tours – and, finally, his poignant farewell with the all-star Back to the Beginning concert, just three weeks ago. The sheer number of artists who turned out to pay homage in Villa Park was astonishing: it said everything about the regard in which the band and its frontman were held by the metal community.However much heavy metal has changed and developed over the last 56 years, it’s very difficult to imagine how it might have turned out had Black Sabbath not existed. Every artist who chose to work in the genre thereafter – and indeed umpteen artists that didn’t – carries something of Black Sabbath in their DNA, and one suspects they always will. It’s equally hard to imagine Black Sabbath making anything like the impact they did without Ozzy Osbourne. “I always thought that whatever I had was temporary,” he wrote in his autobiography I Am Ozzy, a line that perhaps harks back to his desperate pre-Sabbath early years. The exact opposite proved to be true.Explore more on these topicsOzzy OsbourneMetalPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

I wouldn’t call it shame. I wasn’t sure if it was right or wrong. I wasn’t sure if it was something I could share with other people.”It is curious to hear these words spoken at the outset of a disarmingly sweet documentary. What kind of perversion, or even crime, is twentysomething Michaud confessing to in his own living room? A glimpse behind him provides a clue to his obsession and anxiety: displayed on a table is a collection of toy locomotives and model railway books. And the centrepiece is a model of Thomas the Tank Engine.I was still asking for Thomas toys on my 10th birthday. My parents thought it was weirdIn one of his letters to the Corinthians, St Paul wrote that when he became a man he put away childish things. Brannon Carty’s documentary, called An Unlikely Fandom: The Impact of Thomas the Tank Engine, is a rebuke to that philosophy. It celebrates the men (and the fans Carty interviews are overwhelmingly male) who have found friendship, community and creativity in what, as far as I can judge, is the most wholesome of subcultures.Yet a sense of shame pervades Thomas the Tank Engine fandom. “Aside from a handful of people,” says Carty, “no one’s really out and proud about it – because it’s socially unacceptable, especially here in the States.” Why? “I think Thomas gets looped in with Sesame Street and other preschool TV shows over here, whereas in the UK it’s seen more as a children’s show.”View image in fullscreen‘Honest and sincere’ … devotees in Carty’s film.Photograph: Requiem PicturesSuch nuances of a multiplatform global brand – whose merchandising spans pasta shapes and duvet covers, and whose fans number devotees in Japan and Australia – were not, you would think, on the mind of Reverend Wilbert Vere Awdry in 1943. It was then that Thomas was born, on a fictional island called Sodor.Awdry’s son Christopher needed cheering up from measles. And the reverend thought his tales of anthropomorphised steam locomotives, operating on the Fat Controller’s North Western Railway, would be just the ticket. Two years later, the first illustrated books appeared, colourful antidotes to postwar austerity Britain.When I was a child, in the 1960s and 70s, I borrowed the illustrated adventures of Thomas and his pals from my local library. For later generations, though, Thomas means something else. His name evokes nostalgia not for the books but for all the TV series, in particular Thomas & Friends, which first aired in 1984 in the UK, written by the late Britt Allcroft and narrated first by Ringo Starr, then later by Michael Angelis and others including, in one spinoff, the silken-voiced ex-007 Pierce Brosnan.Many of the twenty- and thirtysomething Thomas fans whom Carty interviews, and Carty himself, watched these shows as kids, and nostalgia for the plucky locomotive has haunted them into adulthood. Carty and his older brother watched the show as preschoolers in North Carolina, and would play with Thomas toys, but then their paths diverged. “He lost interest,” says Carty. “I didn’t.” Why? “I can’t explain it. My parents can’t explain it. They thought it was weird. I remember my 10th birthday: I was still asking for Thomas toys. I don’t know – it just clung to me like a disease. I’m happy that it clung to me, though. Now I’m a year shy of 30 and it’s still my thing.”What’s the appeal of Thomas in the US? “You don’t see a lot of steam engines over here. People see the Thomas engines and think, ‘Well those are just made up. Those aren’t real.’”View image in fullscreenA pick-me-up for a boy with measles … Thomas’s creator, the Rev W Awdry.Photograph: Requiem PicturesAs US versions of the TV series started appearing in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Thomas got a makeover. The Fat Controller became Mr Controller. After Starr’s stint as narrator ended, he was replaced in the US first by countercultural comedian George Carlin, and then by Alec Baldwin.How did An Unlikely Fandom come about? “I was studying film at the University of Northern Carolina,” says Carty. “My professor said, ‘Just go shoot a documentary. I don’t care how long it is. Just find something you care about.’ So I decided to film the adult Thomas fans who I knew. I made that film and graduated – then I realised there’s a bunch of fans in the UK that needed to be in this. A ton in Australia. A whole scene in Japan.”The fact that many of the interviewees are in their 20s and 30s suggests that much of the TV shows’ enduring appeal lies in nostalgia for childhoods dating from when the shows were first broadcast. But there’s more to it than that. Thomas has long held an appeal for people with autism. Indeeda 2001 survey foundthat children with autism and Asperger syndrome enjoy and identify with Thomas more than any other children’s character. Why? Respondents cited Thomas & Friends’ straightforward stories, overt narrative resolution, bold colours and clear facial features.View image in fullscreenHe’s got a ticket to ride … Thomas & Friends narrator Ringo Starr.Photograph: DMI/The LIFE Picture Collection/ShutterstockThat said, anyone really can identify with the scamp. For example, in Down the Mine, Thomas gets his comeuppance after teasing Gordon the big engine for smelling of ditchwater after an unfortunate incident. When Thomas later tumbles into a mine, he is rescued by Gordon, who indulges in no tit-for-tat sneering whatsoever. Thomas learns two lessons: don’t ignore warning signs and don’t be a jerk to your mates.Carty sometimes struggled to get interviewees to appear in his film. “A handful were nervous about being on screen and having their identity out there. I said, ‘Trust me. No one’s going to look stupid. This is going to be very honest, but it’s also going to be sincere. So as long as you are honest and sincere, the film will reflect that.’”An Unlikely Fandom does more than that: we watch devotees expressing themselves articulately, detailing how they learned film-making, or other creative pursuits, through fashioning fan fictions. Matt Michaud recalls how he took a video class at school and, inspired by a teacher to make his own movie, went home, got out his Thomas toys, put up a sheet for a backdrop, assembled rudimentary lighting and made his debut film. “That summer,” he says, “I made 13 episodes and started to build a following on YouTube.”Indeed, the life expectancy of Thomas has been extended by two things Awdry could never have foreseen. Without the internet, forums instantly connecting fans worldwide might not have existed; and without YouTube, the rich world of fan films – such as Carty’s own 2012 short Snow Trouble – might not have been seen so widely. “I don’t think that happens as much with other cartoon characters. I’m sure there are Star Wars fans who make fan films, but I don’t think Bob the Builder or Fireman Sam fans do.”Carty’s next project could not be more different. “It’s about these Italians who came to Florida in the 1990s and made Jaws 5.” That’s its unofficial title: Bruno Mattei’s film is also known as Cruel Jaws. “They wound up getting sued and their film was banned in the US. It spoke to me because Jaws and Thomas are my childhood.” Why was it banned? “They stole footage from the first three Jaws movies and the main theme is lifted from Star Wars. It’s horrible, but I love it. It’s cheesy and streaming free everywhere. I would recommend it.”Before he finishes that documentary, provisionally entitled Twilight Jaws, Carty will next month attend the UK premiere of An Unlikely Fandom. Much of the film’s sweetness comes from Carty’s footage of fans at conventions, making podcasts or – having been initiated into the world of steam railways through Thomas and his friends – working happily with like-minded souls as volunteers on narrow gauge heritage railways.What I most enjoyed about his film is the complete lack of snarkiness about grownups who are essentially playing with toys. “That was just the thing I wanted to get out to the world. I faced a lot of hardship for it. Other people faced a lot of hardship for it. Even fans gave other fans a hard time. They didn’t know how to process it, right? A lot of people said to me, ‘I wish I had this film when I was growing up because I would have realised I was not alone.’ When you’re growing up, parents are like, ‘Why aren’t you making friends? You need to find your crowd.’ A lot of Thomas fans did just that in later life. It’s such a healthy, positive thing.”Carty tells me he and his girlfriend, also a Thomas fan, don’t yet have children. “Whenever kids come into the picture, it’s going to be a Thomas household,” he says. Then, with the hint of a sigh, he adds: “If they don’t like it, we’ll reconsider.”Brannon Carty will take part in a Q&A following the UK premiere of An Unlikely Fandom atAlstom’s Litchurch Lane Works, Derby, on 2 August.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsChildren's TVTelevisionChildren and teenagersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The former dancer explains how it all fed into her new standup showTue 22 Jul 2025 09.58 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Jul 2025 12.17 EDTShare‘My first thought,” says Thanyia Moore, “was there has to be a show in this.” The comedian is talking about what happened when her debutEdinburgh festivalfringe show flipped from fun into misfortune. Standups often embrace personal tragedy, spinning it all into material – and that was certainly the case with Moore, three years ago. The former dancer from London had a 10-year buildup to her first fringe show – a deliberately light introduction to her world. She’d become known as a consummate MC, won the Funny Women award in 2018, and was breaking into TV as an actor and writer. Moore wasn’t even sure she wanted to do the fringe. “I’ve never been enticed or influenced,” she says, “by what people think you should do.” But then came an offer from Soho theatre’s production arm, and the chance to prove she could build an hour of standup from scratch persuaded her to head to Scotland.I threw myself into therapy: breath work, womb work, tea-drinking, tree-huggingCompared to other debutantes – who are generally battling crushing financial and career pressures – Moore felt relaxed. Her show’s run was paid for, she’d had time to finesse it, and she’d just got to grips with some huge personal news: she was pregnant. She decided to keep this to herself, but take it easy, turning down other gigs to focus on her solo show.The previews went well. She was excited. Then, showering before her first show, she saw blood. Moore recognised the signs: she had had a miscarriage before. What happened next is the subject of August, a show she begins performing in Edinburgh next week, which takes us through the Scottish NHS, her diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, and travelling to London for surgery before rushing back to the fringe to finish her run. It’s a show about coping, about powering on when the whole world wants you to stop.In August, Moore reflects on her tendency to push loved ones away and look for distractions in work and humour. She ignored concerned messages and filled her schedule with up to nine shows a day. There was, she says, an element of “running from friends and family who wanted to look after me. But I’m very spilt milk – there’s nothing I can do. The other option was to stay at home with people telling me to rest and asking if I’m OK. That’s not going to change the situation. Why not go to the place where nobody knows what’s happened and just be treated the same?”View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t have to think about anything sad’ … the comedian in Edinburgh.Photograph: Rebecca Need-MenearThe comedian’s instinct to think about her experience as a future show “gave me relief and lightness”. She passed off her brief disappearance as a groin injury sustained during a dance number in the show. And then there were all the distractions of Edinburgh during the festival. “From someone sunbathing half-naked in the middle of the meadows,” she recalls, “to grown men walking round in wizard outfits. That’s what I love the fringe for – I didn’t have to think about anything sad.Many weeks later, she started making an effort to confront her feelings. “I was throwing myself into different types of therapy: breath work, womb work, tea-drinking, tree-hugging. It wasn’t until the next year that I probably had my first cry.”She admits now that she was grieving. “I’d never been attached to becoming a parent,” she says. “That took ages to get my head around – and now I had to unpick it.” There was the physical side, too: “I also was like, ‘Why does my body not do the thing it’s supposed to do?’ I feel sad when I think, ‘Babes, you really went through it – and you just carried on. You need to be kinder to yourself.’ I won’t be, because this is who I am, but there are days where I’m like, ‘That’s heavy.’”Working on the show gave Moore space to process. After considering writing it as theatre, she returned to comedy as she had rarely seen this topic broached with humour. “I was obsessed with not making it a sad show,” she says. “My focus was to make sure the audience felt safe to laugh when I wanted them to laugh, feel when I wanted them to feel.” The result is funny, of course, yet surprisingly light. “I’m telling you the truth. And the truth is, ‘I don’t like being sad all the time.’”Does it feel contradictory to write about dwelling in sadness in a show that revisits her experience every day for a month? Moore hopes August shows that not everyone grieves in the same way, and that’s OK. At previews, audience members have shared stories, not just of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. “People have resonated with losing something and carrying on,” she says. “If your friend’s sad, then asking every day ‘Are you all right?’ is reminding them every day that they might not be. Just get through it, babes, and try not to stay there too long.”Thanyia Moore: August is atPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, 30 July to 24 August; andSoho theatre, London, 1 to 6 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsComedyEdinburgh festivalEdinburgh festival 2025PregnancyMiscarriageinterviewsShareReuse this content"

In our series,My feelgood movie, Guardian writers reflect on their go-to flick, and explain why their pick is endlessly rewatchable.This list will be updated weekly with further picks.Want more options?Here is our earlier list of the10 best escapist moviesand52 comforting, rewatchable titles.SpyDirector:Paul FeigStarring:Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne and Jude LawWhy our writer loves it:“Spy is radical in other respects: it remains the only major Hollywood spy film that features a middle-aged woman as the lead. I know because every so often, in search of a feelgood film, I rewatch what can be inelegantly described as “female-fronted spy comedies” … [p]rojects like these are few and far between; I guess Hollywood does not think there’s enough of an audience for them. To that I say: join us. The delights are profound; the sense of freedom intoxicating; the costumes and the gadgets and the intrigue sexy and absurd and larger-than-life – and an exciting new adventure, that great siren song to the desk-bound, is always just around the corner.”(Rebecca Liu)Read the full reviewSpy is available on Hulu in the US and Disney+ and Netflix in the UK and AustraliaBig NightDirector:Campbell Scott and Stanley TucciStarring:Tony Shalhoub, Stanley Tucci and Marc AnthonyWhy our writer loves it:“Big Night doesn’t yield over much to anxious tension on the one hand or madcap hijinks on the other. This, to me, is what makes it feel so good. There are real stakes to this meal for these characters, but co-directors Tucci and Campbell Scott care enormously that you have a good time at their party. They never want you to refill your own glass.”(Andrew Holter)Read the full reviewBig Night is available to watch on Hoopla in the US and to rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaAmerican MovieDirector:Chris SmithStarring:Mark Borchardt, Mike Schank and Tom SchimmelsWhy our writer loves it:“I feel buoyant and inspired every time I watch the film. It’s such a beautiful example of how much talent exists out there in the world, in unconventional places, that never gets a shot or a look in.”(Daniel Dylan Wray)Read the full reviewAmerican Movie is available to rent digitally in the US and Australia and on Amazon Prime in the UKChungking ExpressDirector:Wong Kar-WaiStarring:Brigitte Lin, Takeshi Kaneshiro and Tony Leung Chiu-waiWhy our writer loves it:“[T]he quirky romantic comedy also manages to be his most joyous and uplifting offering.”(Rebecca Liu)Read the full reviewChungking Express is available on Max and The Criterion Channel in the US and to rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaRushmoreDirector:Wes AndersonStarring:Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia WilliamsWhy our writer loves it:“I am elated each time I watch this poignant, wise and wildly funny film – and, yes, there is a happy ending.”(Rebecca Liu)Read the full reviewRushmore is available on Hoopla in the US or to rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaSubmarineDirector:Richard AyoadeStarring:Craig Roberts, Sally Hawkins and Paddy ConsidineWhy our writer loves it:“It might be a curious choice to name a film that traverses a troubled home life, too-much-too-young sexual experiences, and bullying as my ‘feelgood’ movie, but within its equally dark and peppy 97 minutes is a story about writing your own rules. Adapted from the Joe Dunthorne novel, Submarine is touching, sweet and, crucially, very funny.”(Sophie Williams)Read the full reviewSubmarine is available to watch on Amazon Prime in the US and UK and to rent digitally in AustraliaAngus, Thongs and Perfect SnoggingDirector:Gurinder ChadhaStarring:Georgia Groome, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Karen TaylorWhy our writer loves it:“That’s the magic of Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging for our generation. It reminds us of the joyous madness of our school days, when everything was awkward, messy and packed with heart.”(Anya Ryan)Read the full reviewAngus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging is available on Hoopla and Kanopy in the US or to rent digitally or on Amazon Prime and Paramount+ in the UKAmélieDirector:Jean-Pierre JeunetStarring:Audrey Tautou, Mathieu Kassovitz and RufusWhy our writer loves it:“After completing several good deeds, Amélie falls in love with the elusive Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), a sex shop employee who likes to collect strangers’ photobooth pictures … Although Amélie’s kindness might be the apotheosis of whimsy, it’s radical in its own way – a quiet protest against the indifference and self-interest that seem to rule city life.”(Katie Tobin)Read the full reviewAmélie is available to rent digitally in the USThe Towering InfernoDirector:John GuillerminStarring:Paul Newman, Steve McQueen and William HoldenWhy our writer loves it:“Among the many reasons I’m long overdue for therapy would be that I consider a feature about a bunch of people trapped in a burning skyscraper a feelgood movie. But there it is: the stunning effects (which hold up to this day), the sprawling, larger-than-life cast and accompanying who-will-make-it-to-the-end? suspense, the earnest, cheeseball dialogue – whenever I feel anxious or down, something about The Towering Inferno offers solace.”(Matthew Hays)Read the full reviewThe Towering Inferno is available to buy digitally in the US and rent digitally in the UKWagon MasterStarring:Ben Johnson, Joanne Dru and Harry Carey Jr.Directed by:John FordWhy our writer loves it:“Wagon Master’s great appeal lies in the feel of the thing. ‘Be gentle’, Travis encourages a restless horse, and that spirit pervades the film. It is Ford’s gentlest picture and arguably his most beautiful, both on the surface and beneath it. The film is a plea for tolerance – most of its characters having just been run out of town – that is augmented by a thousand perfect details in word and image: the dialogue spare and true, Ford’s camera going to a square dance and focusing first on the wooden planks shifting in the dirt.”(Rick Burin)Read the full reviewWagon Master is on Tubi in the US and on BBC iPlayer in the UKJawsStarring:Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard DreyfussDirected by:Steven SpielbergWhy our writer loves it:“What makes a film ‘feelgood’? If it’s not a romcom, or otherwise setting out to impart warm fuzzies, familiarity plays a big part. I’ve seen Jaws so many times that watching it now truly feels like sinking into a warm bath.”(Elle Hunt)Read the full reviewJaws is available to rent digitally in the US and is on Amazon Prime in the UKI Wanna Hold Your HandStarring:Stars Nancy Allen, Bobby Di Cicco and Marc McClureDirected by:Robert ZemeckisWhy our writer loves it:“Even at the height of their parasocial hijinks, Zemeckis never treats girlhood obsession with a hint of mockery or condescension. Rather, it’s an affectionate celebration of what it means to be a fan – its heady thrills and innate universality – as hilarious as it is relatable. I wasn’t born anywhere near the 60s, but every time I rewatch I Wanna Hold Your Hand, I feel like I missed out on all the fun.”(Miatta Mbriwa)Read the full reviewThe Lizzie McGuire MovieStarring:Hilary Duff and Adam LambergDirected by:Jim FallWhy our writer loves it:“Nostalgia clouds the mind but I do think this movie is genuinely funny … While the film is undeniably a trite tableau of teen movie cliches, it avoids the harshest and grossest ones that were popular at the time. No one is mocked for having an eating disorder or stalked oh-so-romantically. It is aspirational in the silliest sense – while other movies might’ve inspired you to flirt like this or dance like that, nothing in The Lizzie McGuire Movie could be copied: you’re either in danger of being mistaken for an Italian pop star or you’re not. This means it didn’t make 11-year-old me feel bad about herself, and it still makes adult me feel good.”(Amelia Tait)Read the full reviewThe Lizzie McGuire Movie is available to watch on Disney+ in the US and UKSullivan’s TravelsStarring:Veronica Lake and Joel McCreaDirected by:Preston SturgesWhy our writer loves it: “Sullivan’s Travels reminds us there’s something inherently incorruptible about clinging to the scraps of happiness we’re given.”(Alaina Demopoulos)Read the full reviewSullivan’s Travels is available to rent digitally in the US and UKThe RebelStarring:Tony HancockDirected by:Robert DayWhy our writer loves it:“[T]there is something rather wonderful about seeing Anthony Aloysius St John Hancock in full and living colour, operating at the height of his powers, the man who his writersdescribedas ‘the best comic actor in the business’. And of course the film is a wonderful portal to a vanished world, a net-curtained Britain just on the cusp of its transformation by 60s pop culture. Lucian Freud called The Rebel the best film ever made about modern art; well, he should know, but for me it’s more than that – there’s an extra joy in remembering the hours I spent tittering at it with Dad as we lolled on the three-piece suite back in my gormless teenage years. If anything makes me feel good, it’s that.”(Andrew Pulver)Read the full reviewWithnail and IStarring:Paul McGann and Richard E GrantDirected by:Bruce RobinsonWhy our writer loves it:“The tape went back to Blockbuster. I bought my own. I took it to college and watched it drunk and sober, with friends and alone, in halls and in my desperate pit of a house. Through early adulthood, into fatherhood, on DVD then streaming. To watch Withnail is to discover it again.”(Martin Pengelly)Withnail and I is available on Max and the Criterion channel in the US and on Channel 4 in the UKRead the full reviewYou’ve Got MailStarring:Tom Hanks and Meg RyanDirected by:Nora EphronWhy our writer loves it:You’ve Got Mail “may be naive and soppy, but as a single person it keeps me optimistic that genuine connection may still be found by logging on to your computer (or unlocking your iPhone)”.(Alim Kheraj)Read the full reviewYou’ve Got Mail is available on Hulu in the US and on Now TV in the UKWhen Harry Met SallyStarring:Billy Crystal and Meg RyanDirected by:Rob ReinerWhy our writer loves it:“I sometimes ask myself whether I should love When Harry Met Sally as much as I do. I mean, isn’t the film a bit reductive when it comes to gender? Maybe. Yet at the same time, it’s a romantic comedy that’s actually romantic and actually funny, something few romcoms can boast today. But the reason it’s my feelgood film is because I discovered it at a time when I needed it most.”(Henry Roberts)Read the full reviewWhen Harry Met Sally is available to rent digitally in the US and UKKabhi Khushi Kabhie GhamStarring:Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Amitabh BachchanDirected by:Karan JoharWhy our writer loves it:“Scenes from this movie are seared in mind and I often quote its lines in my daily life – such is its hold on me. I am a complete sucker for the drama, the music, the pageantry, the familiar (though outdated) movie tropes, the costumes, the sets – after all, I grew up watching Bollywood movies (SRK is the love of my life, he just doesn’t know it). It is a heaping dose of nostalgia that instantly uplifts my mood and restores my spirit, no matter how in the doldrums the world around might seem.”(Tasneem Merchant)Read the full reviewKabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham is available on Netflix and Amazon Prime in the US and UKThe PaperStarring:Michael Keaton, Glenn Close and Robert DuvallDirected by:Ron HowardWhy our writer loves it:“Perhaps it’s all just borrowed nostalgia for the half-remembered 90s, to remix James Murphy’slyric. But I see it as a feelgood film that makes you feel good because it never shouts about it; there’s no need to force joy, it’s just there in all that messy exuberance. The maddening life happening relentlessly, the people at work in the loud city, the thrill of chasing down a story – this is what is actually joyful.”(Larry Ryan)Read the full reviewThe Paper is available to rent digitally in the US and UKThe Wedding SingerStarring:Adam Sandler and Drew BarrymoreDirected by:Frank CoraciWhy our writer loves it:“One thing I love most about The Wedding Singer is the soundtrack that includes You Spin Me Round (Like a Record), Blue Monday and Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic. Barrymore sings a bit of 99 Luftballons into her oversize headphones. Sandler gets to perform his own compositions: Somebody Kill Me (“I was listening to the Cure a lot when I wrote this”) and Grow Old With You – the latter he performs on a plane to stop Barrymore from marrying the evil Glenn. The ending features a brilliant cameo from 1998 Billy Idol playing 1980s Billy Idol, who wakes from his booze-addled slumber to shove Glenn in the airplane toilets. (“Excuse me, sir. I have to serve the beverages.”)”(Rich Pelley)The Wedding Singer is available to rent digitally in the US and on Amazon Prime in the UKRead the full reviewMamma Mia!Starring:Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried and Pierce BrosnanDirected by:Phyllida LloydWhy our writer loves it:“Mamma Mia! isn’t a movie – it’s a holiday. It’s a film so divorced from subtext and intricacy that its only ask for viewers is to bask in the Greek sunshine as the sounds of Abba wash over them … It was never meant to be taken seriously; it’s a film without pretense. Much of what he complains about is precisely what makes Mamma Mia! the perfect cinematic comfort blanket.”(Jeffrey Ingold)Mamma Mia! is available on Max in the US and on Now in the UKRead the full reviewPink FlamingosStarring:Divine, David Lochary and Mary Vivian PearceDirected by:John WatersWhy our writer loves it:“The will to create a movie for the specific purpose of appalling anyone unaware of its true meaning turned Pink Flamingos into the ultimate litmus test. You either got its sick jokes or you didn’t. But those who did got something far more lasting than a laugh. We got a one-way ticket to an underground populated by parallel dissidents, an entire community of the unruly and free. That’s a lot to gain, which is why, even decades after I first saw Pink Flamingos, I return to it whenever I need to be reminded there’s a universe of possibilities out there not reflected in the world we know now.”(Jim Farber)Read the full reviewDefending Your LifeStarring:Meryl Streep and Albert BrooksDirected by:Albert BrooksWhy our writer loves it:“Life-affirming” is perhaps an overused adjective, but few movies have successfully illuminated the human condition as well as this one. Fear is commonplace in our daily lives, but Albert Brooks’s film might hold the key to ridding the worries of anxiety-ridden people such as myself. As the new year often brings about feelings of regret and unease, Defending Your Life is the warmest hug you can receive.”(Oliver Macnaughton)Defending Your Life is available to rent digitally in the US and the UKRead the full reviewNotting HillStarring:Julia Roberts and Hugh GrantDirected by:Roger MichellWhy our writer loves it:“What is so wonderful about the film is how effortless it all seems. The story isn’t complex; there are no gunfights or CGI raccoons; the greatest jeopardy in the film involves Grant having to catch Roberts before she goes back to America – a problem that reads as plausibly insurmountable in 1999 but today would be remedied with a few WhatsApps. But, despite the illusion of effortlessness, getting everything right in this way is deceptively tricky. Has a single romcom ever managed to marry all of the necessary elements – cast, script, timing, an intangible magic – so perfectly? (No. The answer is no.)”(Ralph Jones)Notting Hill is available on Netflix in the US and Channel 4 in the UKRead the full reviewMarried to the MobStarring:Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew ModineDirected by:Jonathan DemmeWhy our writer loves it:The movie is a long list of quirky pleasures, including a “starter kit of premium 80s college rock (New Order, Pixies, the Feelies), well-placed family dog reaction shots, and an FBI agent who dresses himself like Wallace in the Wallace & Gromit shorts. Few of the laughs in the film feel like punchlines or payoffs to some heavily orchestrated joke. Demme’s approach is more low-key and breezy, cruising confidently on the assumption that his DayGlo gangland will be fun enough without him having to push too hard. He catches a rhythm and does the mambo Italiano. It feels like your feet never touch the floor.”(Scott Tobias)Married to the Mob is available on Hoopla, Kanopy and Pluto in the US and Amazon Prime in the UKRead the full reviewRush HourStarring:Jackie Chan and Chris TuckerDirected by:Brett RatnerWhy our writer loves it:“Rush Hour taps into something that stirred my heart then and now: an ease settles into the two actors, Chan and Tucker’s joviality feeling so genuine that the east-meets-west tropes evolve into characters who have something real at stake, and who are also having fun.”(Tammy Tarng)Rush Hour is available on Netflix in the US and Amazon Prime in the UKRead the full reviewFather of the BrideStarring:Steve Martin, Diane Keaton and Martin ShortDirected by:Charles ShyerWhy our writer loves it: “Why do I come back to this film again and again? As a girl and younger woman I was emphatically against marriage (though I’ve since softened) and watched it more as a comedy horror than anything aspirational. The only aspect of the Bankses’ life I’d want is the kitchen. And yet watching Franck and the family put on their ridiculous show makes me want to be part of it. I love ritual, and ceremony, and Steve Martin, and Martin Short, and Diane Keaton.”(Laura Snapes)Where to watch:Father of the Bride is available on Hulu and Disney+ in the US and on Disney+ in the UK and AustraliaRead the full reviewDiggstown AKA Midnight StingStarring:James Woods and Louis Gossett JrDirected by:Michael RitchieWhy our writer loves it:“Diggstown is the perfect feelgood movie – a breezy but exciting genre mashup with enough of a hangout vibe that you can have it on in the background, but also enough stakes that you will inevitably end up giving it your full attention.”(Zach Vasquez)Where to watch:Diggstown is available on Amazon PrimeRead the full reviewBurlesqueStarring:Cher and Christina AguileraDirected by:Steve AntinWhy our writer loves it:“Many of those who panned Burlesque on its release would feel punished by this cosmically appointed choice of comfort movie. A sequined patchwork quilt of all manner of backstage musicals and melodramas from various eras of Hollywood – starring, in a naked reach for cross-generational gay fandom, dual divas Christina Aguilera and Cher – the film inspired critical comparisons to A Star is Born, Cabaret and Showgirls, most of them unflattering. It made $90m at the global box office: not a flop but not a palpable hit either, least of all for a film where the feather budget alone could have funded a modest indie drama. Antin, whose long but scattered pre-Burlesque career ran the gamut from acting to screenwriting to stunt work to producing Pussycat Dolls reality shows, hasn’t directed another film since. The world, by and large, hasn’t mourned.”(Guy Lodge)Where to watch:Burlesque is available to watch on Netflix in the US, on Sky Cinema in the UK and ABC iView and Amazon Prime in AustraliaRead the full reviewHead of StateStarring:Chris Rock and Bernie MacDirected by:Chris RockWhy our writer loves it:“I’ve come back to this film so many times after the election for laughs, only to wind up seeing the whole picture as a clearer allegory for Kamala Harris’s defeat than Obama’s victory. Like Harris, [Chris Rock starring as Mays Gilliam, a small-time politician turned presidential hopeful] was a party sacrifice, offered up to make a certain loss look less bad on the cards, thrown into the fray at the 11th hour, plugged into a humming campaign apparatus, and touted as a history maker. It really makes you think about how close comedy is to horror.”(Andrew Lawrence)Where to watch:Head of State is available to stream in the US on Freevee, Tubi, Paramount+ and MGM+, in the UK on Paramount+ and on Amazon Prime in AustraliaRead the full reviewA Knight’s TaleStarring:Heath Ledger, Shannyn Sossamon and Paul BettanyDirected by:Brian HelgelandWhy our writer loves it:“To me, watching a feelgood film is an intensely nostalgic exercise. That’s because whenever a film is special or timely enough to take up lodging in your heart, rewatching it is also an act of remembering an old version of yourself.A Knight’s Taleis shaded by the genuine sadness of Ledger’s death only seven years after its release, but when I watch it I also remember the way it used to make me feel, as a girl who loved the jousting because her older brother did, all the while secretly cherishing an action film for being so brazenly sentimental.”(Francesca Carington)Where to watch:A Knight’s Tale is available on Amazon Prime in the US and available to rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaRead the full reviewAlita: Battle AngelStarring:Rosa Salazar, Christoph Waltz and Jennifer ConnellyDirected by:Robert RodriguezWhy our writer loves it:“My feelgood movie for when humanity lets me down is Alita: Battle Angel, a movie where much of humanity hangs out in a city-sized junkpile. And though I don’t press play with this aspect particularly in mind, it’s nice to imagine a future where things have gone terribly wrong (that just seems realistic at this point) yet unforeseen triumphs still emerge from the tech-nightmare garbage heap. There are plenty of more time-honored films that take a more direct path to temporary bliss, including sci-fi movies better-equipped to restore faith in humanity.”(Jesse Hassenger)Where to watch:Alita: Battle Angel is available to watch on Hulu in the US, on Netflix and Disney+ in the UK and on Disney+ in AustraliaRead the full reviewI Know Where I’m Going!Starring:Wendy Hiller, Roger Livesey, Pamela BrownDirected by:Michael Powell and Emeric PressburgerWhy our writer loves it:”I Know Where I’m Going! offers up such portentous moments of mystical and romantic significance lightly, alongside comical asides and colourful eccentricity. It’s a disarming strategy, which tends to leave the audience every bit as bewitched as (the film’s main character) Joan. In this corner of the universe, anything might be possible, even an ancient curse.”(Pamela Hutchinson)Read the fullreview for I Know Where I’m Going!Where to watch:I Know Where I’m Going! is available to watch on Tubi, Amazon Prime and the Criterion Channel in the US and is available to rent digitally Australia and in the UK and watch on BBC iPlayerRead the full reviewExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood moviefeaturesShareReuse this content"

With drummerJudith SchwarzandArthur Fussyon modular synthesiser, he has formed an unorthodox trio to deliver a show in which each stroke, beat and jump lives up the title: Make It Count. It’s an hour of unusual rigour with an electrifying thrill – and the standout from my whirl through Vienna’sImPulsTanz festival, a kaleidoscopic programme of performance and participation.With the studied nonchalance of a rock star, Haitzmann stands on one of three island-like platforms, swinging what could be mistaken for a mic lead.Hanna Kritten Tangsoo’s lighting design will become increasingly mercurial but right now the synth desk twinkles, beams crisscross the stage creating an anarchic A next to the drum kit and the swirling rope resembles a red flash of lightning.The surface of Haitzmann’s stage becomes a drum skin and the rope’s handle a substitute stick to build rhythm, each thud ushering in a sound that suggests the crack of a glacier. The musicians, wearing similar mottled outfits, pick up each other’s prompts and the sound swells until you can’t always identify each instrument. That’s because Haitzmann is now jumping feverishly and will spend most of the performance skipping: the swish and squeak of his exercise interrupted with an occasional yelp to cue a switch in lighting.View image in fullscreenBrings everyone in the room in … Make It Count.Photograph: Alicja HoppelThis is an incredibly disciplined piece, more so than much gig theatre, and the tempo slows for an erotically charged sequence in which the rope steadily thwacks the floor against the sultry pulse of the accompaniment. Haitzmann may look like a boxer in training but the difference is this is not an individual endeavour – he wants to get in the zone but bring everyone else in the room with him.The intensity builds, punctured by Haitzmann’s occasional break for a snack or drink. A feat like this could easily come across as larky or po-faced but the design, music and movement are wholly integrated even in more delicately handled sequences, which retain an air of rehearsal experiments, where upturned cymbals are placed around the stage and struck with the rope. It all amounts to the most imaginative reframing of a music gigsince KlangHaus stormed the Edinburgh fringe in 2014.View image in fullscreen‘Performing is a high-wire act’ … Joe Alegado in Bits and Pieces.Photograph: Bobal PhotographyPart of ImPulsTanz’s young choreographers’ series, called[8:tension], Make It Count is a tightrope of a show, which chimes with an observation at the start of festival veteranJoe Alegado’s latest creation. “Performing is a high-wire act,” says Alegado. “An act of courage!” That’s the kind of circus-barker spiel that more typically introduces acrobatic spectacle but his new choreography, prefaced by softly spoken reflections and a meditative projected film, is triumphantly unshowy.Alegado has been teaching workshops at ImPulsTanz since it was co-founded, 41 years ago, by Karl Regensburger (who still presides over the festival) and the lateIsmael Ivo. Staged in a studio at Vienna’s Arsenal, a former military complex, under the unprepossessing title Bits and Pieces, Alegado’s offering captures what you could call the quality of sharing. On a barely lit stage, he begins with a graceful solo, the movement – especially the play of his fingers – often as wispy as his long grey hair. The piece ends with him pulling an imaginary thread; the next dancer arrives and resumes the motif.View image in fullscreenThe play of fingers and small gestures … Bits and Pieces.Photograph: Bobal PhotographyOne soloist inspires another soloist and they then join together in a duet; three individuals are in turn activated by another and led into a quartet. A playful sequence spotlights only the twisting hands of all four in a row (Alegado is joined by Blanka Flora Csasznyi, Simona Lazurová and Katarina Vinieskova), their black costumes concealing them in darkness. Throughout are gestures of giving and receiving, inspiring and developing, each move rounding out another’s idea to suggest the passing on of knowledge.In the Arsenal’s warren of studios, workshops are doing just that, at all levels, with public classes ranging from dancehall to Limón technique, watched by anyone who chooses to linger. (The festival’s Public Moves programme has a series of open-air stages across the city for people to take part, too.) Alegado’s array of pieces have a similar openness; the voiceover, though portentous, discusses the challenge of being fully present on stage and in achieving timelessness in your work. That is done through the most minimal of means here; a simple caress or a glance are not nothing, the pieces suggest – they can prove long-lasting. In these fragments, Alegado evokes a stillness, no matter how busy the movement or the accompaniment, which at one point consists of a cacophonous layered looping of breath work. When the 45 minutes are up, the parting gesture is of thread being wound up, ready for the next time.View image in fullscreenWhen does sharing trauma become narcissism? … Luigi Guerrieri in Poor Guy.Photograph: Lukas BeckBits and Pieces could just as easily provide an alternative title for the [8:tension] show Poor Guy, performed at the Schauspielhaus byLuigi Guerrieri, not least because he is fully naked throughout, save for jewellery from both the “Gypsy and non-Gypsy” sides of his family. Guerrieri explores how and when the sharing of personal trauma tips into narcissism or is met with kudos – whether it’s done on or off stage (and perhaps especially online, where the work originated). “I’m tired of myself,” he says, stretching out several octaves in that final word with look-at-me glee.In these vignettes, the distinction between memoir and sketch can be unclear: was little Luigi really delivered by a firefighter, and made the fire department’s mascot? Amid the occasional dead-end routine, it’s certainly moving and very funny; Guerrieri has a sophisticated understanding of how humour can not just temper but elucidate the pain in his story. There is also some innovative vocal delivery from our wildly charismatic host despite a viral infection that has limited his range tonight.View image in fullscreenResponding to Madonna’s call to arms … Lenio Kaklea.Photograph: Marikel LahanaHe begins by massaging his nipples, as if milking his story for all it is worth. A family history of violence and instability emerges but he upends expectations of autobiographies, particularly “misery memoirs”, and unsettles the transaction between performer and audience, roaming the crowd and flattering us individually to seek our approval. If we pity Guerrieri, the show asks, does it empower him or us?Against the same exposed brickwork of this stage, Greek choreographerLenio Kakleastarts her double bill with Alegado-esque projections of dancing hands, fluttering like shadow puppet birds in her film An Alphabet for the Camera. Kaklea frames parts of her body using her fingers as a substitute viewfinder, before widening the lens to show her performing as a tiny figure lost in vast landscapes both natural and industrial (her silver coat merging into the greyscale of a warehouse). In such an environment, how do you express yourself?Kaklea uses Madonna’s 80s hit of that name in the second piece, Untitled (Figures), performed on stage after an audio recording of Lesbian Nation author Jill Johnston. Kaklea has tremendous presence and first appears in bra and fishnets, responding to Madonna’s call to arms with finger clicks, smooth hips, coy glances, disco rolls and salsa shimmies before she struts down a chalked-out catwalk. But when the song is done, she deflates in a daze of confusion. It triggers a bid to express what she’s got – but on her own terms. Off come the bra and tights, on go side-buttoned jeans, boots and western hat but the techno score eventually leaves her on her back as if thrown from a horse.Changing into a pale pink leotard, she shifts through a series of seated poses, maximising eye contact with the audience. A balletic sequence is then given a rodeo-rider swagger; her dissatisfaction returns, her poses now like a doll contorted into awkward positions. Next comes a nautical costume – a nod, perhaps, to another of her queer idols, the artistYannis Tsarouchis. The show loses focus with her beguiling transformation as a lounge lizard, prowling around the audience with her tongue darting, but you’re left with the sense of a series of portraits in which Kaklea has searched for her own reflection.View image in fullscreenInspired by Strasbourg’s ‘dance epidemic’ of 1518 … Delirious Night.Photograph: Bea BorgersIn contrast to Guerrieri and Kaklea’s introspective solo pieces is the frenetic ensemble of Delirious Night, choreographed byMette Ingvartsen, at the Akademietheater. It takes inspiration from the “dance epidemic” recorded in Strasbourg over several weeks in 1518, when people were gripped by a mania to keep dancing – some of them right until death. The hysteria is captured in a banner on stage: “Attitudes Passionelles.” But the febrile atmosphere that Ingvartsen captures is of our own Covid era: that strange combination of collective unity and fear, dissociation and division, the rumble of protest and the potential to rebuild. The stage fills with bodies seeking connection, the mood somewhere between campfire shindig and unruly protest. “How can I resist? I want to resist,” runs one refrain.The dancers wear masks – Halloween ones, wrestling ones, beastly ones akin to Chewbacca – and many of them are topless, beating out rhythms on their bodies. There is no ringleader here, the paths pursued are freestyle and only occasionally do some of the nine performers fall into step. Ingvartsen captures that feeling of being out late, passing revellers, unsure whether they’ll prove to be jubilant or malevolent.Drummer Will Guthrie drives the piece with his own feverish score, the movement becoming more jagged and incantatory, and some of the dancers seem to visibly age as they wearily group together and question how they can go on. You begin to feel the same as the vibe reaches an end-of-the-night directionless state, the hangover seemingly arriving even before sleep. Ingvartsen set out to record “what living in times of crisis does to our bodies” and the result is both adrenalised and bleak, if never as precisely delivered as Make It Count.Ingvartsen’s dancers are seeking a release, a transformative state, like Haitzmann jumping rope. Or, in less extreme ways, like so many taking part in the open air classes around town at a festival that favours night owls with its 11pm show times and after-hours parties. Crossing the Danube late one evening, I spy a makeshift stage full of couples swaying right by the water. Here is a city that never sleeps – because it just keeps dancing.ImPulsTanz: Vienna international dance festivalruns until 10 August.

Bugonia, which also stars Jesse Plemons, is a remake of 2003 Korean sci-fi film Save the Green Planet! by Jang Joon-hwan.Further star-packed films announced by Venice’s artistic director Alberto Barbera on Tuesday morning are Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama Jay Kelly, with a cast that includes Clooney, Adam Sandler, Laura Dern and Greta Gerwig, and artist-film-maker Julian Schnabel’s meta drama about the creative genesis of The Divine Comedy, In the Hand of Dante, which has roles for Al Pacino, Gerard Butler, John Malkovich, and Martin Scorsese as an elderly sage who advises Oscar Isaac’s Dante Alighieri.Indie film legend Jim Jarmusch, a surprise absence from the Cannes lineup this May, is for the first time competing for a Golden Lion with anthology film Father Mother Sister Brother, starring Adam Driver, Charlotte Rampling, Cate Blanchett, Vicky Krieps and long-time Jarmusch collaborator Tom Waits. “Cannes had always prevailed,” said Barbera at Tuesday’s press conference. “We have him this year.”In recent years Cannes has gone some way to reclaim its status as the world’s premier springboard for serious films with an eye on the box office, launching accoladed and commercially successful titles including Sean Baker’s Anora, Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall and Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest. Yet with few obvious arthouse-to-mainstream crossover contenders emerging from the Croisette this year, Venice may feel it has earned a comeback.Veteran US director Gus Van Sant will come to Venice with historical kidnapping drama Dead Man’s Wire, while Hurt Locker director Kathryn Bigelow sweeps into town with geopolitical thriller The House of Dynamite starring Idris Elba.There are also new works from noted European directors. Oscar-winning Hungarian auteur László Nemes comes to Italy with Orphan, a drama set after the 1956 revolt against Soviet rule that Barbera described as the director’s “most personal film to date, because it is based on his father’s memories”. There will be a competition premiere for French director François Ozon’s black-and-white L’Etranger, the third cinematic adaptation of Albert Camus’ novel, following Luchino Visconti’s 1967 version and Zeki Demirkubuz’s 2001Turkish telling.Jude Law is starring in the unlikely role of Vladimir Putin in Olivier Assayas’s The Wizard of the Kremlin, a film that examines the Russian president’s rise as seen by his spin doctor, played by Paul Dano. Italy will be represented by Luca Guadagnino’s After the Hunt – a London-shot college drama starringJulia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Chloë Sevigny – and the ever-productive Paolo Sorrentino’s La Grazia, previously announced as the festival’s opening film.Venice, which has a reputation as the least overtly political of the “big three” European film festivals, is not shying away from recent geopolitical events this year. In the main competition, Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania’sThe Voice of Hind Rajabtells the real-life story of a five-year-old Palestinian girl who was killed when a vehicle carrying her family was shelled by Israeli forces in January 2024.German film-maker Werner Herzog, Russian director Alexander Sokurov and US investigative journalist Laura Poitras lead a notably strong non-fiction line-up. Herzog, who will receive a lifetime achievement at Venice, will also be showing his new filmGhost Elephants, about a mythical herd of the animals roaming the jungles of Angola.Poitras, a leading chronicler of post-9/11 digital surveillance practises, will premiere Cover-Up, a portrait of Seymour Hersh, the American journalist who gained acclaim in 1969 for exposing the My Lai massacre but whose use of anonymous sources in recent reports have been viewed more critically.Russian Ark director Sokurov will showcase experimental Director’s Diary, a five-hour work that Barbera said “isn’t easy to follow”, while Sofia Coppola is going to present a doc on fashion designer Marc Jacobs,Marc by Sofia.This year’s Venice jury will be presided over by US director Alexander Payne, and includes exiled Iranian film-maker Mohammad Rasoulof, Brazilian actor Fernanda Torres, and Romanian director Cristian Mungiu among others.TheVenice international film festivalruns from 27 August to 6 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsFilmVenice film festivalGeorge ClooneyEmma StoneJulia RobertsDwayne Johnson (The Rock)FestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

CBS ispart of Paramount, which needs the Trump-controlled Federal Communications Commission to approve its$8bn sale to Skydance.Paramount pulled the plug three days later, with Trump revelling in the firing of one of his most prolific detractors, posting on his Truth Social platform: “I absolutely love that Colbert was fired.”Colbertcame out swingingon Monday, telling Trump to “go fuck yourself”.He joked that it had always been his dream to have a sitting president celebrate the end of his career.“They’re pointing out that last Monday, just two days before my cancellation, I delivered a blistering monologue in which I showed the courage to have a moustache,” he joked.“I mean, obviously,CBSsaw my upper lip and boom, cancelled. Coincidence? Oh, I think not. This is worse than fascism. This is stachism.”In an anonymous leak over the weekend, CBS had appeared to suggest the Late Show lost $40m-$50m last year. Colbert joked that he could account for losing $24m annually. “Where would Paramount have possibly spent the other $16m?” he joked. “Oh yeah.”In a gesture of solidarity, Colbert’s fellow late-night show hosts – Last Week Tonight’s John Oliver, Late Night’s Seth Meyers and The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart –all showed up for a joke in Monday night’s episode. They were joined by other entertainers and journalists including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Weird Al Yankovic, Andy Cohen, Anderson Cooper, Adam Sandler and Christopher McDonald.Meanwhile Stewart, who gave Colbert his late-night start in the 1990s, issued a blistering attack of his own. On Monday’s episode of The Daily Show – which is also part of Paramount – Stewart lambasted its decision to cancel Colbert’s show.View image in fullscreenAnti-Trump protesters gathered outside the Ed Sullivan Theater, home of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“The fact that CBS didn’t try to save their No 1 rated late-night franchise that’s been on the air for over three decades is part of what’s making everybody wonder,” Stewart said on hisComedyCentral program. “Was this purely financial, or maybe the path of least resistance for your $8bn merger?”He added: “If you believe – as corporations or as networks – that you can make yourselves so innocuous that you can serve a gruel so flavourless that you will never again be on the boy king’s radar … Why would anyone watch you? And you are fucking wrong.”Stewart then led a choir and the audience in a chant of “go fuck yourselves”, directed at corporations who bent the knee to Trump.Over on The Tonight Show, host Jimmy Fallon noted that viewers were planning to boycott the network over the decision. “CBS could lose millions of viewers, plus tens of hundreds watching on Paramount+,” he joked.On air, Colbert was visibly moved after his guest, the actor Sandra Oh, proclaimed a “plague on CBS and Paramount,” paying tribute to his work speaking truth to power while staying funny.Skipping a promised question-and-answer session after the taping of Monday’s show, Colbert told his studio audience, “I was nervous coming out here,” and added: “I will miss you.”Outside the headquarters of The Late Show, which is taped at midtown Manhattan’s Ed Sullivan Theater, protesters held placards that said: “Colbert Stays! Trump Must Go!”Audience member Elizabeth Kott, a 48-year-old high school teacher, called Colbert’s firing “terrible”.“It’s really awful that it’s come to that in this country, where companies feel the need to obey in advance. It’s really awful,” she told AFP.Explore more on these topicsStephen ColbertTrump administrationParamount PicturesCBSUS televisionDonald TrumpTV comedynewsShareReuse this content"

My five-year-old daughter walks in this space.”The film, which features Judi Dench narrating 14 Shakespeare sonnets, wasshowing on IMMA’s Living Canvas outdoor screenon the front lawn of its Dublin gallery, but was removed from the museum’s programming following the complaint. However, IMMA insisted that they have removed the film briefly out of “an abundance of caution” and that they “would be delighted” to programme the film again. The museum has confirmed it will show the film again in August on the same screen.View image in fullscreenThe outdoor screening area at the Irish Museum of Modern Art.Photograph: IMMA/IMMA Irish Museum of Modern ArtIn the statement, Fletcher said: “When the complaint was raised, towards the end of the film’s two-week run, we made the decision to pause the screening of this work to seek clarification on the implication of showing a PG-rated film in a public domain to ensure we were not in conflict with any planning or screening legislation for art in a public space.”Fletcher added: “It is regrettable that the event reported on in the Sunday Times has been misconstrued in a rush to judgment.”James Mackay, a close collaborator of Jarman’swho produced many of his filmsincluding The Angelic Conversation says: “Who would have thought that Angelic Conversation, the most tender of Derek’s films, would offend. I know that we live in dark times but, really, two boys kissing with closed lips. Has it come to this?”Responding to the initial complaint, Mary Cremin, IMMA’s head of programming, said the matter would be “reviewed internally” and said the film was certified PG and suitable for public screening.The complaint was then referred to the Broadcasting Authority ofIrelandwho forwarded it on to the Irish Film Classification Office (IFCO). Jarman’s film, only having shown for 10 days of its planned 14-day runtime, was removed from the museum as they awaited “professional opinion”.Fletcher said that “clarification has been attained” and they plan to reinstate screenings of the film, adding: “We would like to assuage the valid disquiet of all our LGBTQ+ community that we shall continue to proudly programme inclusively across our site.”“IMMA has been at the forefront of championing Jarman’s practice, developing the first major retrospective since 1995 and a major accompanying publication. We have also purchased his works for the national collection. We have shown his films and will continue to do so as part of our public programme.”Explore more on these topicsFilmDerek JarmanIrelandLGBTQ+ rightsEuropeCensorshipnewsShareReuse this content"

But research has revealed Manchester’s Royal Exchange building was at the centre of slavery and colonialism, making it “one of the most important locations in the history of global capitalism”.Since 1973, the building in St Ann’s Square has been home to the Royal Exchange theatre, now stagingLiberation(until 26 July), the critically acclaimed play marking 80 years since the1945 Pan-African Congress– a conference that brought together luminaries of Black liberation, including Kwame Nkrumah, Jomo Kenyatta and WEB Du Bois,in Manchesterto progress national independence movements from European rule.View image in fullscreenEamonn Walker, as George Padmore, and Eric Kofi Abrefa, as Kwame Nkrumah, in the play Liberation at the Royal Exchange.Photograph: Isha Shah PhotographyBut while the theatre celebrates African liberation, the building, in its former life, was at the heart of European colonial dominance. As a 19th-century trading hall it was the place where “Manchester’s businessmen, industrialists, financiers, and politicians made decisions and deals that transformed landscapes and environments across continents”,research into the building’s historyfound.The research, a series of reports involving the University of Manchester (UoM)emerging scholars programme, reveals how the Royal Exchange’s 19th-century subscribers were enmeshed in the enslavement of African peoples, the exploitation of India, the opium trade in China, as well as the development of the economic doctrine of free trade, the birth of the modern city, and thedevelopment of liberal politicsand economics.Crucially, the reports shine a light on how African people resisted enslavement, fighting a plantation economy that British elites were at the heart of.The research looks into the story ofJack Gladstone,an enslaved man on the Success sugar plantation in modern-day Guyana, and his father, Quamina, who led up to 13,000 people demanding freedom in 1823’s Demerara Uprising before it was violently suppressed.View image in fullscreenIllustrated account of the Demerara Uprising, which broke out on 18 August 1823 in Guyana.Photograph: John Carter Brown LibrarySuccess was owned byJohn Gladstone, the father of the 19th-century prime minister William Gladstone, whose wealth derived from enslavement, colonialism and compensation payments after 1833’s Slavery Abolition Act. Members of the Gladstone family played a key role in funding the Royal Exchange building, which was Manchester’s third exchange building, completed in 1874.The story of Sandy, an African prince who staged a rebellion against enslavement in Tobago in 1770, is also highlighted. Sandy’s rebellion was suppressed with the help of Lord Ducie, a Manchester landowner and Royal Navy officer who sold the land at Market Street on which Manchester’s second exchange, a forerunner to the current Royal Exchange site, opened in 1809.View image in fullscreenJohn Gladstone, the owner of the Success plantation in modern-day Guyana.Photograph: AlamyDucie, also known as Francis Reynolds-Moreton, was the grandson of Thomas Reynolds, a director of the South Sea Company that formed in 1711 and secured exclusive rights from the British government to traffic and sell 4,800 enslaved people annually to Spanish colonies throughout the Americas.Facilitated by Ducie’s land sale, the 1809 exchange replaced the first Manchester exchange – which had been built in 1729 by Sir Oswald Mosley, an ancestor of the20th-century fascist leader Oswald Mosley– creating an “exclusive space” for dealmaking, the researcher Destinie Reynolds found. Mosley Street and Great Ducie Street in Manchester memorialise these family names.The second exchange professionalised commodities trading at a time when Manchester’s cotton industry was booming – fuelled by crops planted, grown, picked and packed by African people enslaved and transported to the Americas, often by merchants from nearby Liverpool.Consequently, key, founding players in the second exchange – granted the “Royal” title when Queen Victoria visited in 1851 – were traders in enslaved people, and plantation owners who “used their power and influence to lobby in favour of the slave trade and reduce tariffs on (its) goods … helping to continue its growth”, advancing the “liberal” case for free trade simultaneously, the researcher Beth Carson found.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This included commissioning a poem, Holding Space, from the Manchester writer Keisha Thompson (who is now the programme manager for theGuardian’s Legacies of Enslavement team), which explored the building’s story, in its Great Hall.The Royal Exchange theatre said of the most recent research into the building’s past: “While reclaiming this space was a radical act, we must acknowledge how this grand empty building came to be here. The building’s very existence is a testament … to the colossal profits of a global cotton economy … one of the most important locations in the history of global capitalism.”Dr Kerry Pimblott, of UoM, added: “We believe centring such accounts … raises important questions about the legacies of this history in the present and how reparative action can help shape more just futures.”Explore more on these topicsManchesterCotton Capital: ongoing seriesSlaveryBlack British cultureReparations and reparative justiceGreater ManchesterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The traditional list of the funniest gags at the Edinburgh fringe, presented by the TV channelU&Dave, has been scrapped for 2025.A statement from UKTV, which owns the channel formerly known as Dave, said: “U&Dave’s Joke of the Fringe was originally created to celebrate and spotlight grassroots comedy talent. As our commissioning focus evolves, we’re taking the opportunity to reflect on how we continue to support comedy in the best way possible.”The award was launched in 2008 and has been held every year since apart from during the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year,Mark Simmonswon for his nautical one-liner “I was going to sail around the globe in the world’s smallest ship but I bottled it”. The shortlist of jokes was chosen by a panel of UK comedy critics and comedians, then submitted anonymously to 2,000 members of the public who were asked to pick their favourites.

But he dislikes its hysterical leftwing critics too – arguably with more vehemence. He takes great pride in having no truck with tribes, but he does belong to one: like halitosis, as Terry Eagleton quipped, ideology appears to be only what the other person has. Williams may think he is a freethinker above the fray, but he has a creed – and it is liberal complacency.His 2010 debut memoir Losing My Cool was the story of – as the subtitle had it – Love, Literature and a Black Man’s Escape from the Crowd. Rap, he declared, was not so much a genre as a subculture, seducing young black men into a world of crime. That, apparently, would have been Williams’s fate (when he physically attacks his girlfriend, for instance, hip-hop lyrics shoulder the blame) had it not been for Pappy, his disciplinarian father, who foisted 15,000 books on him.The classics beat crime in the end, and we leave Williams on his happy road to intellectualdom, absorbing Sartre in Parisian cafes. But it wasn’t enough for him to merely present his own story; Williams elected to hold up his life as an example for black Americans. “See, you can be just like me” is the breathless gist of Losing My Cool. It never struck him that he might have had certain class advantages – a father with a PhD in sociology; a mixed-race heritage; an upbringing in white, bourgeois, suburban New Jersey – that make him somewhat unrepresentative as a role model.Self-Portrait in Black and White: UnlearningRace, Williams’s second memoir, published just before the pandemic, served up more hyper-agentic advice. The springboard for these post-racial reflections was the birth of his daughter. Bearing, as babies tend to do, a resemblance to her mother, who is white and French, Williams’s child is blond. It follows that there is an arbitrariness to the whole business of race, from which Williams swiftly emancipates himself. Then comes the counsel: black Americans would do well to follow in his footsteps by “transcending” race themselves. Conceding that this may be an easier proposition for him and his white-passing daughter, he exhorts mixed-race people to “form an avant garde when it comes to rejecting race”.Williams’s grand subject being himself, now we have a third memoir. Summer of Our Discontent takes a caustic look at Black Lives Matter from the lofty vantage point of his Parisian garret. At the outset, he tells us that the self-preening, race-mad identity politics of left-leaning liberals has fostered atomisation and precluded solidarity. As a consequence, the illiberal, unhinged right, now united behind Trump, has stolen a march on them. But from this not unreasonable edifice, Williams throws up a enormous scaffolding of enemies, which comes to encompass anyone and everyone engaging in some form or another of collective action. Ultimately, by the end, it appears that Williams’s beef is not so much with Trump as with his leftwing critics.This is a strange, muddled book. On the one hand, Williams emphasises the primacy of class over race in the US.George Floyd, he says, was not your average African American: he was poor, unemployed, and had a criminal record. Horrific as his killing by a white policeman was, it was unduly racialised by BLM. Fewer than 25 unarmed black civilians are killed by police annually. Most black people will never find themselves in Floyd’s shoes, Williams contends.While class is important for Williams, class politics isn’t. There is only so much that initiatives to lift the poor from poverty can achieve, we are told, because “the fundamental political unit, going back to Aristotle, remains the family”. The left has got it all wrong, obsessing over the “macro level” when real change apparently happens at the individual level.Williams’s strategy is to cherrypick the most ludicrous examples of “Trump Derangement Syndrome” to smear the entire left. Sympathy from a few celebrities for the actor Jussie Smollett – who was accused of faking a hate-crime against himself, which he denied – is taken as evidence of the left’s crumbling “moral authority and credibility”. BLM, he claims, was driven by “an ascendant raider class” of middle-class and not always black activists seizing institutional power – such as when a “multi-ethnic mob of junior employees”ousted New York Times opinion editor James Bennetfor publishing Senator Tom Cotton’s call to deploy troops against BLM protests.Williams’s other objections appear to be mostly aesthetic. He expends much energy pillorying the performative activism of such BLM “allies” as “the official Twitter account of the wildly popular British children’s cartoon Peppa Pig”, which tweeted a black square in solidarity. Later, visiting BLM-ravaged Portland, he mourns that “a beloved statue of an elk has been toppled”. This in a town with a “well-deserved reputation” for “exquisite gastronomy”.Quelle horreur.He concludes by suggesting that the left and right are just as odious as one another. The storming of the Capitol in 2021, he says, had a mimetic quality, the populist right “aping” the “flamboyant reflex” of the unruly left. With such invidious comparisons, and with such a dim view of collective action, Williams is unable to make the case as to how precisely his homeland is to move towards a post-racial utopia. Excelling in sending up bien-pensant opinion, he has no answers. Fixated on slagging off the left, he has marooned himself on an island of vacuity. So when he articulates a positive vision of the future, all he offers are new age nostrums such as “reinvestment in lived community” and “truth, excellence, plain-old unqualified justice”.His plea for perspective is similarly misplaced. Young black Americans, Williams whinges, have been seduced by the race pessimism of the likes ofTa-Nehisi Coates, his more popular nemesis. He enjoins us to look on the bright side: the racial wage gap is closing; black school attainment rates are nearing white levels.Williams’s Panglossian outlook is, I suspect, a form of American parochialism. His homeland, he says, is a “society that is frankly more democratic, multi-ethnic, and egalitarian than any other in recorded history”. The Gini coefficient and Democracy Index beg to differ. There are eminently sensible reasons for race pessimism in America. Segregation and ghettoisation are facts of life. The wage gap between black and white people is still a staggering 21% (in Britain, it’s under 6%). White Americans live three-and-a-half years longer than black Americans on average (black Britons outlive white Britons).Collectively, it was not the complacent optimists (who declared we had never had it so good) but rather the do-gooding pessimists (that demanded change at the dreaded “macro level”) who overthrew slavery and fought for civil rights. Individually, too, pessimism pays. For someone who sets great store by personal agency, Williams will no doubt appreciate Billy Wilder’s melancholy observation – occasioned by losing three relatives at Auschwitz – that “the optimists died in the gas chambers; the pessimists have pools in Beverly Hills”.Summer of Our Discontent: The Age of Certainty and the Demise of Discourse by Thomas Chatterton Williams is published by Constable (£25).

In life, he was almost preternaturally prolific.He started late– his debut, The Hoop, didn’t appear until he was in his early 30s – but with that first poetry collection a dam was breached; over the next three and a half decades, he published at the rate of nearly a book a year.His output was eclectic: 17 collections were interspersed with novels (notable among them the ravishingA Summer of Drowning, set in far-north Norway under a luminescent midnight sun) and a trio of bleached and harrowing memoirs that laid bare the catastrophe and disintegration of his early life. But he was a poet first and foremost, a poet in his heart. To read his poetry is to feel, just for a moment, as if the world’s edges have been pushed back; as if, by standing beside him, you too can see further and more clearly. The shock of his final collection isn’t that it exists; it’s no surprise at all to hear him from beyond the grave. Rather, it’s the realisation that, after the astonishing generosity of these last decades, what we have in our hands really are his final words.It’s our great good fortune, then, that Burnside’s closing work is also one of his finest. The poems are few in number – just 19 – but there’s no impression, often present in posthumous collections, of a structure hastily assembled out of ill-fitting parts. In fact, The Empire of Forgetting is marked both by its coherence – thematic, imagistic and linguistic – and a sense of its fitness. These are poems that deal directly and almost exclusively with mortality.This isn’t, of course, new territory for Burnside: his poetry has always been death-haunted, peopled with ghosts. But here the focus has shifted, from the general (loss, religion, afterlife, decay) to the specific. The whole collection is an anticipation of, a grappling with, his own death: “the darkness-to-come”.In a handful of the poems, he appears to meet the matter head-on. Last Days, with its mentions of “hospice” and funereal “white chrysanthemums”, offers a vision of “starlight at the far end of the ward / where time has stopped, the way it sometimes stops / in theatres, when the actors leave the stage”. A little further on, in As If from the End Times, he picks up the word “last” (which sounds like a bell throughout the collection) and weaves it through the poem, most plangently in the elegiac central stanza, which describes “Last day of birdsong; salt rain in the trees; / the echo of someone going about / their business, making good or making hay / – you never know for sure, although you know / that something here is coming to an end”. But for the most part, his impending mortality is considered more obliquely, through the twin lenses, familiar to Burnside-watchers, of nature (damaged, depleted, but still sublime) and memory.It is memory – and its shadow, forgetting – to which Burnside keeps circling back in this collection, the space that it takes up here offering a clear and poignant mirror of the space it takes up in our lives as we move past middle age. His mother and father, both frequent presences in his work, take the stage again: the former a locus of endless longing; the latter a baleful “trail / of Players No 6 and coal-tar soap”.Burnside imagines his way into death, and in doing so, comes close to writing an epitaph for himselfBurnside’s writing, particularly in his memoirs, is dominated by his father’s bitter legacy, but as he himself draws nearer to the end, it is his mother to whom he turns. In the heart-catching title poem, he leans into poetry’s ability to efface time, locating the pair of them in a soft-lit, sweet-scented version of his childhood. “What if my mother walked home in the grey of morning, one last day”, he writes, going on to imagine a reunion that is almost epiphanic, a “momentary // halcyon of everyone / together, voices, singsong in the dark”. To Burnside the afterlife isn’t a voyaging out, but a voyaging in: a route back into the lost past.And this past, when he conjures it, is marked by its externality: it’s not the houses and furniture of memory that he craves, but the seasons, the “evening dusk”, the “quince, or damson, strafed into the grass”, “the field where, once, / we played Dead Man’s Fall”. The purity and clarity of nature in the past is counterpointed by the present: “a ruined / thicket, sump oil / rotting in the grass, a spill / of Roundup in a rut of mud and dock”.This is the Burnside we know: attentive to the degradation of nature; staring it in the face and obliging us to stare at it, too. But in his final collection, more often than not, it’s the beauty that possesses him. These are poems filled with songbirds, orchards, “birch woods”, litanies of flowers (“foxgloves, purple / loosestrife, sprawls / of clematis”). The weather is beneficent: sunlight filters, snow drifts and blankets, frost “performs its secret ministry”, there’s the sound of “small rain in the leaves”. The world we see here, through the eyes of a poet at the end of his life, is almost unbearably beautiful – which makes the leave-taking unbearable too.At the heart of the collection is The Memory Wheel, in which Burnside imagines his way into death, and in doing so comes close to writing an epitaph for himself. The poem concludes on the image of a memory: of “those mornings / when we shivered from our beds / and lit a fire / to magnify the dark”. If Burnside’s poetry – all his writing, but his poetry most powerfully of all – can be summed up, it might be like this: a bright light, an illumination that, in its beauty, reveals the depth of the darkness that surrounds us.It’s impossible not to love the world more when reading Burnside, and impossible not to be more scared and saddened while doing so. He was the ideal laureate of our age, painfully alive to the glory of what we’re losing. Now we’ve lost him, our Anthropocene spirit guide.

Instead, in this small-time British crime drama, James Nelson-Joyce and Kyle Rowe play old mates dealing drugs in the fictional northern town where they grew up. It’s a brawling tale about a man who feels trapped by toxic masculinity, though in the end the film too backs itself into a bit of a dead end of macho violence.Nelson-Joyce is Wes, who has been questioning his life and choices since his best mate Tommy (Rowe) went to prison. Wes and his girlfriend Zoe (Olivia Frances Brown) have just had a baby, and there’s even talk of a job. Then Tommy is released, a repugnant bully unwilling to let Wes go. Rowe’s ferocious performance feels horribly real, like an angry dysregulated little boy with a need to break anything he can’t have. Tommy’s rage gives the film some nauseating moments; perhaps even harder to stomach is the casual misogyny in Wes’s circle. Reputation is a grim portrait of male rage, though it doesn’t seem particularly interested in the reasons behind it.There is a real sense of place though, in rows of narrow terraced houses backing on to wide open expanses of countryside. And for a film put together on what looks like a minuscule budget, it gets a considerable amount done. There’s a promising plotline about one of Wes and Tommy’s customers, the mother of a murdered 10-year-old boy, as well as little flickers here and there of another life open to Wes. But in the end it all builds to a big grandiose violent ending, which is a bit of a shame.● Reputation is on digital platforms from 28 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsMenreviewsShareReuse this content"

The pop culture off-worlders these beasties most resemble physically, however, are the xenomorphs from James Cameron’s Aliens – and not the massive multi-limbed queen, mind you, but the smaller foot-soldier guys who can be played by a fella in a suit.This fella-in-a-suit aspect is the one of the film’s strengths. You might argue that it hinders the willing suspension of disbelief, because you always know you’re looking at a fella in a suit. But in truth there’s something about the physicality of even the hokiest practical effect that is more enjoyable than all but the most skilfully rendered digital efforts.Another area in which the film recalls the earlier work of James Cameron is in the casting of Linda Hamilton (Terminator 2: Judgment Day) in the role of a tough, uncompromising military type. Lest fans get too excited by the Hamilton-heavy marketing for the film, she certainly gives good Hamilton while on screen, but she doesn’t appear for the first hour; it’s very much an “and Linda Hamilton” credits situation. And that’s fine: it’s better to have practical effects and a modest helping of recognisable actors than A-listers sleepwalking through expensive CGI glop for a paycheck. Osiris is far from a perfect film, and it’s certainly not an original one, but it understands the assignment and delivers.Osiris is on digital platforms from 28 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

These are movies so numerous and so obviously comparable to each other that they collectively constitute a kind of Balzacian Comédie Humaine, though on a more intimate scale. It will surprise none of Hong’s admirers to discover that this film once again shows us a series of conversations with familiar repertory players, informal one-on-one chats shot casually in available light, with people doing a vast amount of daytime drinking. Really, does any film-maker show characters getting quietly plastered as often and realistically as Hong?It’s possible to feel simultaneously amused, bemused, intrigued and exasperated at Hong’s film-making, to wonder if the drinking and the consequent inevitable cathartic outburst are in fact cathartic or dramatically meaningful, to wonder what it is leading to. But arguably the enigma is the point. This movie lodged in my mind a little more than Hong’s earlier films, perhaps because it is less contrived and it features a genuinely funny and complex opening scene.Donghwa (Ha Seong-guk) is an amiable but conceited man in his mid 30s who aspires to be a poet; it is quite clear that his wealthy lawyer father is bankrolling him, however much he claims to be independent. For three years, he has been dating Sunhee (Cho Yun-hee) though without ever meeting or apparently wanting to meet her parents. It is only when dropping her off at their house one day that he is prevailed upon to come in and meet them, while being astonished at how grand the house is (in the process revealing that he is more impressed by money than he would admit).Sunhee’s father Oryeong (Hong regular Kwon Hae-hyo) is polite and blusteringly good humoured, though clearly nettled at Donghwa’s finally deigning to say hello. His complicated and contradictory emotions spill out in an amusingly pointless and embarrassing discussion of Donghwa’s secondhand car – which he impulsively asks to drive, just to see what it’s like, and to demonstrate his alpha-male mastery of the situation.Many other embarrassingly uptight conversations between Sunhee’s dad and boyfriend ensue, fuelled by drink. Finally, there is a weirdly fractious scene at the dinner table, triggered by Sunhee’s sister and her scepticism of Donghwa. Yet the boozing seems to result in no hangover, real or metaphorical. Intriguing as ever.What Does That Nature Say to You is at theICA, London, from 25 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsSouth KoreaWorld cinemareviewsShareReuse this content"

Macbeth becomes a cutthroat netball musical at Edinburgh fringeLady Macbeth Played Wing Defence combines comedy, songs and athleticism as a young netball player reckons with her own ambitions against an electro-pop scoreArifa AkbarTue 22 Jul 2025 04.47 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Jul 2025 04.49 EDTShareAspate of Macbeths will hit the Edinburgh festival this month, all of which bring a novel spin on Shakespeare’s Scottish play. There’sMacbeth: The Musical, accompanied by pop classics, andMacbeth for Bairns, a sensory children’s version with bubbles. But the most leftfield must be an award-winning show that has taken the Australian fringe circuit by storm.As mashups go, Lady Macbeth Played Wing Defence is nothing if not high-wire. It’s a black comedy musical, which takes place on a netball court and features a seven-strong team of teen players, one of whom, Mac Beth, is a latter-day Lady M with vaulting ambitions of becoming Year 12 netball champion. The witches are a girl band called the Dagger Divas who goad her towards her goal, by any means necessary.Created and performed by an all-female creative team, Crash Theatre Co’s production debuted at Perth fringe festival in 2024 and arrives in Scotland as part of the House of Oz season. It has been compared to both Six the Musical, which started out at the Edinburgh fringe, and the Australian musicalFangirls, which had its London premierelast year. Its writer, Courtney McManus, who is also co-lyricist and performs the role of the team’s coach, works as an English teacher at an Australian school. She had noticed a lack of interest in Shakespeare among students and set out to encourage teenagers to connect with the tragedy.View image in fullscreen‘How do I make Shakespeare accessible?’ … Lady Macbeth Played Wing Defence.Photograph: Declan Young“In the English departments I’ve worked in, these texts are the ones on the shelves that have dust on them … If I said to my students ‘Who’s Shakespeare?’ they probably wouldn’t be able to tell you because it’s just not that relevant to them. That was key in my thinking: ‘how do I make Shakespeare accessible and relevant?’”Macbeth has always been her favourite Shakespeare play but her family has more of a passion for sport. “So for me it was about ‘how can I get people invested in Shakespeare?’” As soon as she had the idea to set it in the world of netball, she knew it had to be a musical, with bass, synths and athleticism combined. Bec Price composed its electro-pop score and co-wrote the lyrics (she directs the show, too) with influences from Lady Gaga, Kylie Minogue and Charli xcx – but with added sporting elements. Price sampled the sound of netball trainers on a court for one of the show’s main songs,Pick Your Player.“Synths are my favourite instruments in the whole world because they’re so layered,” says Price. “So when the girls came to me to write the music I thought ‘I’m going to make it a dance album’ and that’s exactly what they wanted … The vibe was that we wanted to make Shakespeare really cool and in the club … flashing lights and fast music with girls spinning around.”The play’s themes transposed perfectly to the adrenaline-fuelled world of competitive netball, thinks McManus, and served as a way to explore young female ambition, rivalry and teamwork. “The way the characters have been written by me mirror my experiences with young people when they’re having their worst moments and when they’re having their best, too.” Importantly, Mac Beth is given a redemption arc, explains McManus: “Mac Beth still feels the guilt, she still suffers the consequences of her actions, but she has a road to redemption.”Edinburgh festival 2025: 20 theatre shows to see this summerRead moreThe core message of the show revolves around the collective power of the team and the girls, rather than the individual power that Mac Beth craves. “We can take that message into the groups of women that surround us: we don’t need to be the biggest and the best. We just need to be supportive and supported.”Price has worked as a youth mentor, running camps for young girls’ mental health. “I was really passionate about the word ‘bossy’ which is never used to describe a man. So what is being bossy? What is being ambitious? Let’s put it on a stage and have everything go wrong but still at the end this girl deserves love, and to be part of the team.”Lady Macbeth Played Wing Defence is atAssembly George Square Studios, Edinburgh, 30 July to 25 August.

Amid the indefatigable rise of movies cynically re-spun for the stage, this musical adaptation of the 2010 film featuring Cher andChristina Aguileragoes its own eccentric way. With its monster sound, energy and blinding bling, it is no less than Burlesque 2.0.The original Burlesque brought together Cher’s stadium-sized voice and Aguilera’s “mutant lungs” (to quote a line from the film). Which duo can compare to that? This one, it turns out. You could generate electricity with the combined sound of Orfeh, as burlesque club owner Tess, and Jess Folley as Ali, a small-town singer with a big voice. Ali still blows the roof off this burlesque lounge but the musical is grittier and less sanitised.View image in fullscreenWow factor … Jess Folley in Burlesque.Photograph: Pamela RaithThe film revolved around Ali’s hunger for fame, with a subplot of financial ruin around the club akin to that in Moulin Rouge. Ali is now a too-loud gospel singer (“Beyoncé trapped in a Taylor Swift body”) who goes to New York not looking for fame but a long-lost mother. So many of the plotlines turn new, unexpected corners.With music composed by Aguilera, Sia, Todrick Hall, and Jess Folley, it keeps old songs such as the signature tune Show Me How You Burlesque and Something’s Got a Hold on Me and adds fabulous new numbers, big and fizzing and hugely witty, including the rap-infused Call Mama Daddy and the jazzy Ammo.The biggest surprise is that this reworking is done by Steven Antin, the film’s original writer and director. His musical underworld is not nearly as dark as Bob Fosse’s but not saccharine either, and far raunchier and more outre than the film. Antin’s script is so contemporary that it referencesBaby Reindeerand contains a show-stopping joke about theColdplay concert’s kiss-cam couple. The humour seems peculiarly British in spite of the American accents.Todrick Hall’s choreography is a sensation, with jaw-dropping athleticism, balletic moves and circus acrobatics, while Marco Marco’s “more is more” costumes deserve an award. Hall, also the show’s director, is an absolute blast as a performer. He doubles up as Ali’s old gospel teacher and Tess’s right-hand man at the lounge, blowing Stanley Tucci’s benign gay best friend of the film out of the water.Ali’s slow-burn romance with Jackson (Paul Jacob French) is cute when it could grate, with French providing a fantastically funny number in Natalie, in which he dumps his ever-absent ex-girlfriend by phone. The song seems coyly to poke fun at the earnestness of the film – an endearing send-up. The show as a whole bares it artifice every now and again, but without indulging in knowingness.View image in fullscreenFierce … Orfeh as Tess in Burlesque.Photograph: Pamela RaithAsha Parker-Wallace, as Ali’s rival Nikki, makes her professional debut with an almighty voice while Tess’s ex-husband Vince (George Maguire) is now a conniving Brit (less panto villain, more Hamilton’s King George III). And where Cher was a kindly fairy godmother type, Tess is a hard nut with fierce energy and a vague resemblance to Michelle Visage.The whole thing is very RuPaul. There is no lip-syncing, as in the film, but enough leather, feathers, sequins and disco ball lighting for a season of Drag Race. Plus harnesses, thongs and bared, bouncing flesh, too. Jake Dupree, as the gender fluid Trey/Chardonnay, is phenomenal, complete with nipple tassels in one striptease, while Alessia McDermott and Jess Qualter, as the kinky twins Summer and Spring, bring more of the burlesque spirit.It is over-adrenalised and messy in its plotting, but you forgive the blips. This is a production stuffed with personality, spectacle and wow factor. Come for the nostalgia, perhaps, but stay for the new kicks: bigger, naughtier and camp as hell.AtSavoy theatre, London, until 6 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsMusicalsTheatreChristina AguileraWest EndDancereviewsShareReuse this content"

Last bank holiday weekend, with a 13th birthday to celebrate and a row of suns on the weather app, we found a solution. Our family of four, plus two of my sons’ friends, would drive two hours west, to Devon. We’d stay by the sea, go cycling and swimming, play Perudo and sit around a campfire, eating birthday cake. And be home the next day. We’d be 24-hour party people. Only less rock’n’roll, more rock pools and bacon rolls.Brandy Head mapThe catalyst was discoveringBrandy Headon a Google Maps scroll. Like a mini youth hostel, sleeping six, with one double bed, two twin bunks, a shower room and an open-plan living, dining and kitchen area, this boxy little building sits on the clifftops between Sidmouth and Budleigh Salterton, accessible only on foot. Perched nearly 60m above sea level, its terrace is the big selling point, enjoying such gull’s-eye views of the sea that it feels like surfing a very tall wave every time you step on to it.Those views now bring a steady stream of guests to Brandy Head, but in the past they brought the RAF – the building was originally put up in 1940 as an observation post for the top secret Gunnery Research Unit based at RAF Exeter. Apparently, it was here that Prof Sir Bennett Melvill Jones perfected the revolutionary aircraft gunnery sight that helped give allied air forces superiority on D-day. Restored from dereliction five years ago by Nell and Sam Walker, tenants of neighbouring Stantyway Farm, in partnership with their landowner, Clinton Devon Estates, Brandy Head opened as a hikers’ hut in 2021.View image in fullscreenA bike trail in Haldon Forest Park, near Exeter.Photograph: Andrew Lloyd/AlamyNot only would a stay steeped in military history entertain the boys but it was also close to Haldon Forest Park for mountain-biking, and two beaches for swimming, paddleboarding and a dependable supply of ice-creams.We stopped atHaldon Forest Parkon the way – and the boys and my husband, Richard, collected their pre-booked bikes and sped off along the park’s trails to hurtle over jumps, bridges and boardwalks. I swerved pedals in favour of hiking boots and headed toCanonteign Falls, another find from map scrolling, just 15 minutes’ drive away.Snaking down lanes fizzing with cow parsley and red campion, and through thatched villages, it felt like driving into the 1950sHome to what the website describes as the highest waterfall in south-west England, Canonteign is a collection of lakes, woodland walks and gardens with a cafe and adventure playground. Its showpiece waterfall was created in the late 19th century, but the real magic lies beyond it, in the fern garden, planted in Victorian times. Largely forgotten, it has been restored by the current owners and the fern expert Julian Reed, and forms an atmospheric glade where children hunt for fairies.It was hard to leave this otherworldly spot, but there were boys to collect, and once reunited it was a half-hour drive to the sea, the back of the car a happy, flat-batteried fug of post-ride exhaustion. Snaking down lanes fizzing with cow parsley and red campion, and through thatched villages festooned with bunting, it felt less like we were driving to the coast and more like driving into the 1950s.View image in fullscreenBeach time … at Ladram Bay, Devon.Photograph: Ian Woolcock/AlamyNell had left instructions for collecting the keys near Stantyway Farm’s honesty cafe, a former Royal Navy warship container now stocked with tea, coffee, homemade flapjacks, squash and dog biscuits. It’s possible to leave cars here and walk in along a slightly longer route, but we carried on to the end of the lane, from where it’s a 10-minute walk up the fairly steep coastal path to Brandy Head.“This is awesome,” said Alex, one of my sons’ friends, spotting a display of bullets fixed under a plastic tabletop on the building’s terrace, evidence of the ammunition testing that was also carried out here during the second world war. “I’m in the top bunk,” said my newly teenage son Owen, racing to bag his spot. No sooner had we put our supplies in the kitchen and slumped on the sofa than a head popped round the open doorway. “Ooh, can we have a look inside?” As Nell had warned us, visiting walkers are almost as much a feature of a stay here as the terrace is. TheSouth West Coast Pathruns along the front of the building and, while a good proportion of its hikers make up Brandy Head’s bookings, others stop to fill up water bottles from the outdoor tap, or to rest on the benches. If you’re looking for seclusion this is probably not the place, but, as a quirky overnight stay, it added to the charm.“Beach time,” announced Lucas, another friend, when the walkers had left, sliders on, towel slung over his shoulders, chivvying the others out of the door. Turning east, it was a gentle 20-minute walk toLadram Bay, a holiday park with a handy grocery store, a chip shop and a perfect little arc of public beach where we hopped over pebbles to swim in the bracing, briny cool.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We walked to Budleigh Salterton, through theRiver Otter Estuary nature reserve, keeping an eye out for otters, beavers and sandpipers. We watched the boys whoop as they caught the chilly swoosh of more waves – and ate pasties from a kiosk on the beach before driving home.That evening by the firepit, though, Richard and I sat listening to waves breaking far below in the fading light. As hares leapt across the field in front of us, it was comforting to think that Stantyway Farm’s wildlife-friendly approach has meant that land once used to prepare for war was now nurturing habitats forcirl buntingsand peregrines.

Emailfeast@theguardian.comAnna BerrillTue 22 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhat batch cocktails are best for summer parties?Ella, by emailFirst things first: stand down that cocktail shaker. When you have more than a handful of people over, you need drinks that scale up easily. And apalomanever fails to hit the hot weather happy-hour spot, says Max Venning, director ofThree Sheets barsin London and co-author ofBatched and Bottled Cocktails. “It’s great for a garden party, because you just whack it all in a jug and into the fridge in the morning, then all you need are iced glasses and soda water.” Combine 350ml good-quality blanco tequila (“OchoorVolcanare my go-tos”), 250ml fresh pink grapefruit juice, 10ml tomato vinegar (“or white balsamic”) and two tablespoons of caster sugar, stir until the latter dissolves, then chill. “While you’re waiting for your guests, coat half the rim of your glasses with a mix of salt, a touch of ground black pepper and a sprinkle of ground cumin: wipe half the outside rim with grapefruit, put the salt mix on a small plate and gently press the wet part of the glass into the salt, so it sticks.” When you’re good to go, fill each glass with ice, fill halfway with the paloma mix, top with soda and stir gently: “Garnish with edible flowers or a grapefruit slice.”Another party starter, says Alex Lyonness, bar manager atLucain London, is anaked and famous, which, happily, is “quick to batch because it’s equal parts mezcal, Aperol and yellow chartreuse, and quick to build because it’s 60ml of that mixed with 20ml lime juice”. Sandia Chang, meanwhile, would lean more towards a “lighter” negroni: “We often pre-batch a cocktail that’s a cross between anamericanoand awhite negroni,which is equal partsLillet BlancandSuze,” says the co-founder ofBubbleshopandKitchen Table, who serves that mix of classic French aperitifs over ice and topped up with soda.If you’re looking to bung things together a little further in advance, try a cherry americano, Venning says: “Mix 300ml Campari, 300ml sweet vermouth and 100ml cherry cordial, and store in a clean, sealed wine bottle in the fridge.” To serve, pour 50ml of the mix over ice, top with soda water and garnish with an orange slice. Or, if you’re feeling fancy, pour 30ml into a flute, top with sparkling wine and garnish with an orange twist. If you’re heading out, though, perhaps to the park or beach, Venning’s batch drinking concept (to be consumed in moderation, naturally) would be a “British coastal negroni”: It’s lighter than the classic, and a perfect sundowner. Mix 200ml Campari (“or, for a brilliant British take on it,Forgotten’s ultrasonic bitter aperitivo”), 200ml red vermouth (“I useVault Aperitivo’s Forest”, staying on the British theme), 200ml gin (“Hepple, for preference”), 20ml blackcurrant cordial, 100ml water and two drops of optional orange flower water, then tip that into a Thermos with a handful of ice cubes.Of course, cocktails don’t necessarily mean booze: “When I was pregnant, Chang recalls, “I often made delicious, flavoured iced teas to take to the park, and a particular favourite washojichatea infused with slices of lime, mint and a little brown sugar.” She also recommends iced green tea with honey and apple marigold. Now that’s sure to keep everyone sweet.Got a culinary dilemma?

Here, I’ve used strained greek yoghurt instead, to add depth to these simple tomato toasts and for a creamy balance to the smoky salsa backdrop. It makes a simple and delicious starter for an alfresco dinner. To follow, a simple,spatchcockedchicken slathered in a smoky, brick-red chipotle paste that is mouthwateringly good.Spatchcocked chicken with smoky mojo (pictured above)Prep5 minMarinate2 hr+Cook1 hr 10 minServes4-61 large head of garlic2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves150ml olive oilSea salt80gachiote paste1 tsp brown sugar3-4 tbsp chipotles en adobo, to taste1 large chickenTo serveLimes, cut into wedgesSoured creamBash the garlic with a rolling pin, slip off the skins and finely chop the cloves with a sharp knife. Empty them into a small pan with the thyme and oil, season with half a teaspoon of sea salt, and heat gently, until the oil starts shimmering and the garlic begins to sizzle. Turn the heat to its lowest setting so that bubbles barely break the surface, and cook for 25 minutes, or until the garlic is soft. (Be careful to keep the heat low or the garlic will burn and become bitter).Add the achiote, the brown sugar and three tablespoons of the chipotle. Taste, season with salt and add more chipotle if you want more smoke and heat (remember it will be tempered by the chicken and in the cooking).Meanwhile, to spatchcock the chicken, use a pair of strong scissors to cut along each side of the back bone, then pull it out and discard or save for stock (or ask a butcher to do this for you, though it takes only a few minutes.) Flip over the chicken so it is breast-side up, and press down with your hands to press it down and flatten it. The chicken is now spatchcocked.Slather half the marinade all over the chicken, then cover and put in the fridge to marinate for a few hours, or overnight (keep the rest of the marinade in the fridge for another time, and for up to a month). An hour or two before you want to cook, take the chicken out of the fridge and leave it to come up to room temperature.If you’re cooking outside, light a chargrill or barbecue. Cook the chicken for 25-30 minutes, turning after 15 minutes, until the juices run clear when you insert a skewer into the thickest part of the thigh. If you’re cooking indoors, brown the chicken skin side down on a griddle or under a hot grill for 10 minutes, then finish it off in a moderate oven – 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 – for 20 minutes, until cooked through.Serve with lime wedges and soured cream, plus jacket potatoes, slaw, a nutty, herby quinoa salad or indeed anything else you like to eat in summer.Grilled tomato toasts with smoky sesame-harissa salsaView image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ grilled tomato toasts with smoky sesame-harissa salsa.Prep10 minDrain1 hr+Cook40 minServes2-4200ggreek yoghurt, or labneh2-3 large ripe tomatoesSea salt4 slices sourdough1 smallgarlic clove,peeled and cut in half1 small handful fresh oregano leaves, choppedFor the smoked chilli oil45g sesame seeds150ml olive oil, or rapeseed oil,plus extra for drizzling2 large garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced50g smoky harissa½tspcumin seeds15ml cider vinegarPut the yoghurt in a fine sieve and leave to drain; if you do this overnight, you will get a more cheese-like product, but you will still have a lovely thick spread after leaving it for an hour.
