Named after the mutterings of a particularly long-winded lecturer, it was the first of many TDK D60s – always the same brand! – from my mate Pat. We had met at our university’s registration day a few weeks earlier and would be friends for more than 20 years until his death in 2018. By then he’d not only beenon staff at the NME– teenage Pat’s dream job – but also written a book about its history.View image in fullscreen‘Bands we’d bonded over …’Photograph: courtesy of Chris WiegandSide A of the tape (entitled “Barry Manilow Live!”) has bands we’d bonded over, such as Kenickie and These Animal Men, two of our first London gigs together. Blur’sPopsceneis included because we were sweaty regulars at the club night of that name at LA2 in Charing Cross Road. The other one (“David Hasselhoff B-sides”) includes Gallon Drunk, the Byrds and Stereolab, all a bit more mature, all nudges into new directions. Everything on the inlay card is in caps and even Pat’s handwriting was cool. I hero-worshipped him well beyond our university years and he shaped my taste in films and fashion as much as music. When we were young he could be brutally, hilariously scathing about bands he despised; later, that energy would be spent more on championing than dissing. It’s years since I owned a cassette player but, looking at the tape now, I’d forgotten it ends with a “secret bonus track!” I’m guessing it’s a shared guilty pleasure (Carter USM?) and can’t wait to find out. It’ll be another joke from not just a cool and funny friend but an all-round unfaltering one.Chris Wiegand‘I still owe her a mix tape in return’Nobody had ever made me a mix tape (or a CD playlist as it would have more likely been, since I grew up in the 00s) until my 19th birthday, and even then it wasn’t a proper one. Having failed to track down a blank CD in Madrid, where we were both working as au pairs, a girl from Colorado I wasn’t exactly dating but who was definitely more than just a friend wrote me a list of songs on a page pulled out of a notepad. I remember reading it for the first time, with its loopy handwriting, doodles, and songs chosenjust for me,and thinking it was the most romantic thing in the world.View image in fullscreen‘I was confused and anxious about so many things’Photograph: courtesy of Lucy KnightLike most 19-year-olds, I was confused and anxious about so many things, but she brought so much kindness and fun into my life. We were the same age, and I can’t imagine that she had everything figured out herself, but she seemed to know more than me about most things, music included, and it was exciting to take a step into her world. I must have lost the scrap of paper at some point over the last decade, and now I can’t recall a single song that was on there. I wish I did, and I wish I had a way of contacting that girl from Colorado – I still owe her a “mix tape” in return.Lucy Knight‘This is the only version of those songs that remains’I find it easily in a bag in the attic – it has a sticker of a cat smoking a spliff, cut around the spools: a remnant of the 90s ska band Hepcat. The one mix tape I would never bin. Chris gave it to me in late 1999. He was 17 and playing gigs at venues like the Astoria. I was 16 and couldn’t go to most of the gigs at venues like the Astoria because it was a school night.It’s not what you’d call your classic heart-on-sleeve emo mix. It’s full of hardcore and punk anthems by bands such as Operation Ivy, Madball, Good Riddance and, randomly, multiple tracks by New Bomb Turks (he must have just bought their album at Tower Records in Piccadilly Circus, where he, then later we, would go on pilgrimages to find all the newest albums).View image in fullscreen‘He wanted me to hear his own band’Photograph: courtesy of Kate AbbottThere are also, seemingly, no songs on side B. I re-listen to the tape now on my grandpa’s old cassette deck, and have to endure almost 45 minutes of static to get back to the start – I simply cannot risk pressing fast forward in case the whole precious thing gets chewed up. Then, all of a sudden, the radio-recorded dolphin tones of Mariah Carey emerge from the static singing Heartbreaker, a track he knew I loved more than any punk, then cuts off before Jay-Z’s verse. Worth the 43 minutes of white noise, truly.But the start of side A, the pièce de résistance – and surely the real reason he wanted me to have the tape – was so I could hear his own band. Two tunes, recorded live with laughably terrible sound levels but faultless drumming by Chris. Two tunes my teenage self listened to over and over.Twenty-five years on, this is the only version of those songs that remains. I absolutely love that they are unShazamable, that they exist solely on this crinkly tape that is one listen away from ruination. I still love those tunes – just as I love his new band. Our two children do, too.Kate Abbott‘This one’s for you, Mum’We didn’t call them mix tapes back in the day. Well, I didn’t. Wasn’t cool enough. They were just tapes with songs on. The first life-changing one was sent to me by a friend Steve and it was just the most brilliant mix of all the punk songs I didn’t know – the Damned, the Buzzcocks, the Ramones, the Pistols, of course, and best of all the Vibrators with Baby Baby. It was – and is – amazing. Lush, romantic, as much full of yearning as feedback, and super loud. Imagine Phil Spector turned punk and you’ve got Baby Baby.It didn’t make me a punk (still too uncool), but it did make me want to dye my hair black (pointless, as it already was), spike it up with sugar, and stick a red arrow through my ear. Which I did a bit later.View image in fullscreenWannabe punk …Photograph: courtesy of Simon HattenstoneThe last mix tape I made, in December 2023, was very much a modern mix tape. Improvised on the night, and on YouTube. Mum was dying and I spent the night by her bedside with my laptop. I just played song after song that I loved for her, unsure whether she could hear. I introduced them, like a DJ. “And this is Tom Waits’s version of Somewhere for you Marje because it’s exceptionally beautiful and I love you.” “And here’s a little number from Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville Don’t Know Much,which makes me cry and think of you because I love you.” “And here’s Leonard Cohen at his most melodic singing Dance Me to the End of Love, and I’ve chosen this because, erm, I love you.” “Now for something a little different, Late for the Sky by Jackson Browne, which I’ve chosen for you because I love you, even if its meaning is a bit more complicated.” The songs kept coming through the night and I played them really loud. “And of course the night would be incomplete without Stevie Wonder’s As. This one’s for you Mum because yes, you’ve guessed it, I love you.”Each one was a love song and in their own way about immortality. I didn’t know it at the time. And I didn’t know what was coming next. I was just somehow reaching for the right songs, in a state almost as altered as Mum’s. I like to think she heard them. But even if she didn’t, she knew how much I loved her. She died early the next morning.Simon Hattenstone‘My sister created the world’s worst Idlewild remix tape’Back in the late 90s, whenever melodic noise-rockers Idlewild would tour, my sister and I would go. We had spent hours engaged in classic sibling bonding: listening to guitar squall while I prevented the mosh pit from stamping on my little sister’s head. Yes, her taste often tended more towards the likes of Steps, but for some reason we both loved this band’s scuzzy pop, and one day, she made me a tape of one of their live gigs.I was extremely excited. I saved it for a long bus journey, popped it into my Walkman, fired it up and sunk into angular, dissonance-strewn indie. It was absolute joy. There were new songs! Ferociously taut renditions of the classics! And … the random intrusion ofKiss Me by Sixpence None the Richer.View image in fullscreen‘It’s a testament to her glorious daftness’Photograph: courtesy of Alexi DugginsConfusion reigned as I suddenly found myself listening to a Christian rock troupe’s schmaltzy ode to smooching – until it abruptly segued back to the gig. And then back to Kiss Me. And then back to the gig. Five minutes later, a blisteringly distorted riff mutated into an advert for a local car dealership. At which point I realised something: my sister had decided to check out a poppier radio station halfway through recording – and inadvertently created the world’s worst Idlewild remix tape.My sister has since died. I’ll never be able to drag her out of a mosh pit again, or hear her attempt at a silly impression of the vocal tics of Idlewild frontman Roddy Woomble. But I’ll always have that tape. It might have been intended as a killer Idlewild live recording, but it’s ended up something much more precious: a testament to her glorious daftness. Best mix tape ever.Alexi Duggins‘We had our ups and downs, to put it mildly, but I’m glad I have this memento’I was given this mix tape in early 2004, at the outset of a relationship that lasted for almost a decade. It lives on a shelf in my living room with a few other cassettes, displayed for aesthetic reasons, since I no longer have a tape deck to play them on. Looking at it now, it seems like a vivid portrait of my ex and his then passions, from the picture of James Dean rolling his eyes on the handmade cover to the scratchy and abrasive music on the tape itself, from Her Jazz by Huggy Bear to Gutless by Hole, deep cuts like Other Animals are #1 by Erase Errata alongside classics like Patti Smith’s Redondo Beach.View image in fullscreen‘A memento of our early tenderness’Photograph: courtesy of Alex NeedhamMore than half the tracks are by female or female-fronted acts; my ex was brought up by his mum and most of his friends were women. He once told me that men had been responsible for all the negative experiences in his life (I suspect that our relationship has now been added to this list). Looking at the track listing I’m reminded of his great taste, noting the appearance of Maps by Yeah Yeah Yeahs, then pretty recent but now a romantic classic.We had our ups and downs, to put it mildly, but I’m glad I have this memento of our early tenderness and intimacy.Alex Needham‘That mix CD was how I discovered Finnish metal!’I am very slightly too young for the golden era of mix tapes – open my first Walkman and you would have only found storybooks on tape – but I amexactlythe right age to be part of the micro-generation of teens that burned CDs (or MiniDiscs) of stolen MP3s from LimeWire for our friends and crushes.There were two enormous problems with this method of sharing songs: one, the file compression made everything sound unlistenably terrible, and two, what youthoughtyou were illegally downloading from LimeWire was very oftennotwhat you were actually downloading from LimeWire. I discovered this when my best friend made me a mix of what she thought were songs by my favourite German metal band, Rammstein. In fact it was a CD full of entirely random European songs that someone on LimeWire had egregiously mislabeled, including a Dutch version of Aqua’s Barbie Girl, all with that spangly sound that was unique to low-quality MP3 mixes of the era.We laughed about this for years, but fun fact, that mix CD was how I discovered Finnish metal (and Megaherz, the most early-00s German metal band to exist).Keza MacDonald‘I could not handle feeling that way about someone’The Beatles’I Want to Hold Your Hand. Weezer’sHoliday. The Cribs’The Lights Went Out. These are some of the songs that my first boyfriend chose to burn on to a CD for me. It was summer 2006. I had found my true tribe outside of school, most nights (and early mornings) were spent in fields, my last year of sixth form was nigh and I had finally fallen in love. I fell hard. I could not believe – or handle! – feeling that way about somebody.Music was starting to properly soundtrack my life for the first time: club nights and indie gigs, soaking up the albums my new mates played and making plans for Leeds Festival. My ex opened my world to some great music I wouldn’t know without him. I thought that CD was so cool and romantic. (“He wants to holdmyhand!”)The short version of this tragic love story: the relationship soured and it ended by winter. It would take me at least a couple of years to get over it.At some point, I threw the CD in the bin along with everything else he had given me – too young, inexperienced and cried out to know I might quite want to see these items again one day. But every time I hear those songs play – and I do regularly seek them out – I’m comforted by a rose-tinted wave of nostalgia. They take me back to a time when life was just really starting – way more highs and heartbreak ahead. I’m glad I’ll always have the music to take with me.Hollie RichardsonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s clear what he gets out of it – not so much the British voterWed 16 Jul 2025 11.22 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 11.25 EDTShareApopular maxim on the American right is that politics is downstream from culture. In the UK, it increasingly feels like politics is simply downstream from the US. With Reform UK ascendant in the polls, Nigel Farage – officially MP for Clacton, unofficially Donald Trump’s emissary to the UK – is setting the terms of the national conversation, and he is importing them directly from across the pond.Over the past few months, Reform has sought tolaunch “Doge” initiatives(referencing Elon Musk’s department of government efficiency), waged war on DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) employment schemes, and called for the UK government to embrace crypto and create a bitcoin digital reserveat the Bank of England, following Trump’s lead. It seems the Brexiteers were right: Britain doesn’t make anything any more – not even its own bogeymen.Reform’s repeated attacks on DEI are particularly striking because DEI doesn’t technically exist in the UK. The equivalent framework is called EDI (equality, diversity and inclusion), and it is nowhere near as prominent as Reform seems to think. At the national level, Reform has claimed that cutting such equality and diversity schemes could save central government£7bn a year– according to 2022-23 figures, the real figure is £27m. Farage nonetheless insists that the British left “obsess about DEI and spend plenty of public money on it”. After Reform’s success at the local elections in May, he warned that all those working in diversity for Reform-controlled councils “better be seeking alternative careers very, very quickly”. But the sought-after image – woke council members walking out of county hall with their redundancy boxes while ordinary, hardworking Britons applaud the return to common sense – is unlikely to materialise. Arecent investigationby the Guardian found that in Reform’s 10 councils, the total number of jobs connected to equality and diversity amounts to fewer than five full-time positions and accounts for about 0.003% of their combined budget.Under Trump’s presidency, Doge has vastly overestimated the scale of its government savings – in one notable instance itmisfiledan $8m saving as an $8bn one – and DEI has been blamed for everything from a plane crash in Washington to wildfires in California to inflation. A sober assessment of the pros and cons of DEI initiatives – the benefits they can bring to companies, their approach to systemic inequalities that can be superficial box-ticking – has nothing to do with the rightwing backlash against them. Republicans aren’t looking for alternative solutions, because attacking DEI gives them everything they need: a way to foment resentment against state bureaucracy, the left, marginalised groups and minorities – appealing to xenophobia and serving capitalist interests at the same time.Why ape US ideas so transparently, especially in a country where even many on the right arerepulsed by Trump? One possible answer lies in semantics. Perhaps the hope is that DEI will sound like something new and scary to Britons who are no longer moved by mentions of previous bogeymen such as “political correctness”, “the bureaucrats in Brussels” and “the woke mob”, just as Doge will sound slicker and more exciting than “austerity” despite in practice meaning the same thing: stripping local councils down to their barest components – consistent with Westminster’s orders for the past 15 years. But shiny US branding will not make cuts any easier. An analysis of Reform’s 10 councils by PoliticsHome found that almost 80% of their combined spending is now taken up bysocial care and homelessness.Another explanation, however, is that Reform’s rhetoric is the symptom rather than the cause of a broader Americanisation of the British right. It is telling that Farage’s greatest asset in trying make DEI mean something has been GB News, itself a knockoff of Fox News, which has tirelessly warned of DEI’s evils – in the NHS, the army, the civil service and so on. (“It’s exasperating the number of hours I have wasted on various online ‘training packages’ on DEI topics,” an anonymous “senior soldier” revealed in a GB News exclusive, giving Britons a sense of what’s at stake.)GB News also recently announced plans to expand its coverage to the US with anightly show about American politicsfrom September. “We’ve seen time and again this year that a decision made on one day in Washington DC is felt the next day in Washington, Tyne and Wear,” GB News’s editorial director, Michael Booker, explained. Paul Marshall, the billionaire hedge fund manager who co-owns GB News, has deepened ties between the UK and US right through other ventures as well, such asUnHerd and the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship. Last year, afterbuying the Spectator, he also came close to purchasing the Telegraph with the help of Ken Griffin, an American billionaire who is one of the Republicans’ biggest donors.Marshall’s son Winston, a former banjoist for Mumford & Sons, is now a podcast host based in the US. At a recent press conference in Washington, he asked whether “the Trump administration would consider asylum” for citizens affected by the UK’s “free speech issues”. Trump’s press secretary said she would look into it.Big pay days and top of the polls: Nigel Farage’s first year as an MPRead moreThe special relationship forming between the UK and US right is tainted by the stark imbalances in wealth and power. Take away the vast wealth of its financial centre in London and the UK is poorer than each of America’s 50 states. The attempts by the British right to import panic about DEI and dynamism through Doge reflect a desire for inclusion and imagining that the UK and the US are in it together.It’s clear what Farage gets from this – the good graces of a US president who wants to be king and prizes sycophancy in his court above all – but the benefits to UK voters are naught. Farage has repeatedly declared his intention to give the British ruling classes a reality check through his success, implying that he alone knows what the UK wants. “I don’t think the Westminster politicians and journalists even get what’s going on out there,” he said in a recent TikTok video. But the references to DEI and Doge should remind us that he hasn’t a clue either.Samuel Earle is the author of Tory Nation: How One Party Took OverExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionNigel FarageDEI policiesDonald TrumpTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Open champion 1951”. Faulkner signed those words for a young fan who had offered up a golf ball en route to the first tee of the final round at Royal Portrush. He regretted it almost immediately. While he held a commanding six-shot lead before the 1951 Open’s last 18 holes, there now existed an embarrassing piece of evidence should he fail to deliver.Fortunately for Faulkner, despite an errant drive on the 1st hole, he went on to fulfil his prophecy by two strokes. It would take 18 years before another English golfer, Tony Jacklin, hoisted the Claret Jug.As the Open returns to Northern Ireland for the third time at Portrush, many will have fond memories ofShane Lowry’s emotional victory in 2019. Yet fewer will recall Faulkner’s improbable triumph during a vastly different era, one without rangefinders and swing analysis, when golfers had to rely on intuition and experience to conquer Portrush.“The Open is one tournament you can’t win suddenly from out of the blue: you have to get a taste for it,” wrote Faulkner,who died in 2005 aged 88. He was no stranger to Portrush, having come third in the Irish Open on his 21st birthday at the same venue. To tackle the super-quick greens, described by Faulkner as “the fastest he had ever seen for an Open Championship”, he pivoted to a pencil-slim putter weighing just 11 ounces (312g).Before the tournament, three-time Open champion Henry Cotton had snapped a picture of Faulkner, then 34, arms aloft, explaining to American amateur Frank Stranahan and England’s Ken Bousfield how he would win the tournament. They are laughing, for good reason. Two-time defending champion Bobby Locke, who would finish tied-sixth, was undoubtedly the favourite. Cotton and 1947 winner Fred Daly were also among the 98-strong field. Not to mention that Faulkner had admitted to playing “rubbish” golf prior to the event. There was a sense of conviction in his words though. “I’ll show them this time,” he told his wife, Joan.A fairly average opening round of 71 on Wednesday meant he started three shots adrift. But when his competitors faltered facing Thursday’s windy conditions, Faulkner stood firm and carded a respectable 70, earning him a two-shot lead. The razor-thin putter had brought results, needing just 27 and 24 putts, respectively.View image in fullscreenMax Faulkner plays out of the rough on his way to victory in the 1951 Open at Portrush.Photograph: Daily Mail/ShutterstockThe final 36 holes of the Open were played on the same day that year. He scored another 70 on Friday morning to increase his lead to six, over Argentinian Antonio Cerdá, thanks to a shot described by playing partner Stranahan as “the greatest shot I’ve ever seen”. After a wayward drive on Babington’s, then the par-four 16th (No 18 today), Faulkner found his ball next to a barbed-wire fence.“I thought there was just a chance if I lifted the club up steeply enough to miss the stile, deliberately sliced the shot and lifted the club up immediately after impact to avoid tearing my hands on the barbed wire,” he wrote. Faulkner executed it just like he had imagined, hitting a ridiculous slice with his four-wood which found the green, to save par.The afternoon began with a sense of foreboding after he signed the young boy’s ball and felt jitters from the 1st tee. Faulkner, whose lead had been significantly reduced by the time he reached the 18th, recalled: “My knees were a bit shaky as I bent down and I had some trouble getting the ball on the tee.”Still, he smoked his final drive down the fairway and a crowd had gathered around his ball. This was a time before tournaments began roping off holes, when besides dealing with the pressure of the moment, golfers had to be mindful not to lose a shoe amid the encroaching spectators.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After pulling out his trusty four-wood, an old friend, Jimmy Adams, hissed loudly at him, trying to tell him he was overclubbing by some distance. There was no hiding behind overzealous marshals, desperately waving ‘quiet please’ paddles back and forth over their heads as if their lives depended on it.He shanked his approach, which fortuitously stayed in play after ricocheting off a spectator’s chest, nestling in long grass on a slope. Miraculously, Faulkner found the green with a superb recovery shot and two-putted for bogey. He signed for a 74, but without giant scoreboards to indicate how his competitors were faring, he didn’t know if it was enough.It took another hour before a messenger rushed forward with good news. “Tony Cerdá’s taken six. It’s your Open.”Faulkner’s 285 total at Portrush, the sixth-worst winning score since 1946, will most certainly not be enough to win there in 2025. But his confidence and fearless approach, on one of the toughest links courses, remain relevant 74 years later.Explore more on these topicsThe OpenGolffeaturesShareReuse this content"

Scream was trying to reinvent the wheel while I Know What You Did Last Summer was just trying to keep it going.Eddington review - Ari Aster’s tedious Covid western masks drama and mutes his starsRead moreAs a franchise, it then quickly became the very thing Williamson was poking fun at in the first place with a rubbishy Bahamas-set sequel (I Still Know What You Did Last Summer!) and, at the time, an inevitable, tossed off, straight-to-video follow-up (I’ll Always Know What You Did Last Summer!). People quickly gave up caring what anyone had been up to during any summer on record and as the subgenre died, it wisely followed. But as Hollywood continues to fixate on millennial nostalgia, history is repeating itself as a revival of Scream (with two new films both hitting bigger than expected and a third on the way) is now being followed by a return for the fisherman, still thrashing away in the shadow of Ghostface, grunting dumbly while his predecessor delivers a self-satisfied lecture on the state of genre film-making (like Scream, there was alsoa limp TV resurrectionthat’s best ignored).Expectations lowered, there’s enough hokey fun to be had here, the familiar formula – kids do a bad thing, someone tortures them for it, with a standard 2020s uplift – new cast meets old cast. It means a return for 90s heartthrobs Jennifer Love Hewitt (who’s been cashing in with a role on TV’s absurd procedural 9-1-1) and Freddie Prinze Jr (who’s been appearing in films you definitely haven’t seen), bringing back one-note characters that were never more then chess pieces but doing it well (they share a solid one-on-one scene that’s more substantial than anything yet given to the returning Scream leads). Like Jamie Lee Curtis’s Laurie Strode who became an alcoholic headmistress in Halloween H20 (a far superior sequel than anything in David Gordon Green’s aggressively stupid trilogy), LoveHewitt’s Julie James is now working in education (a professor!) and she’s dragged back to her home town of Southport when a group of twentysomethings receive a familiar note, a year on from a preventable accident.The sharp young cast, led by Bodies Bodies Bodies standout Chase Sui Wonders, Glass Onion’s Madelyn Cline and Stereophonic’s Tony nominee Sarah Pidgeon, are all stronger than the characters they’ve been given, their dynamic made less effective without the tragedy of high school innocence ending and with an unwise attempt to reconfigure the opening accident. In trying to upend expectations, writer-director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson (who made one of Netflix’s sharpest and funniest teen comediesDo Revenge) messes with the beats a little too much and never really finds a way to smartly justify why the friends wouldn’t have fessed up in the beginning. But what Robinson does understand is that the original two films were both slickly made studio horrors underlined by a real sincerity and her redo is both ravishingly glossy (it looks like a real movie unlike 2022’s Scream which looked like a Netflix movie) and taken just about seriously enough without resorting to easy wink-wink smugness. When the script, co-written by journalist and author Sam Lansky,doestry to inject humour, it’s mostly of a limited LA brand, referencing guided meditations and astrology but not doing much with it (I was genuinely shocked that vaping wasn’t also used as a source of comedy). It’s not annoying enough to distract but it’s never quite as funny as it could be.While the first film did achieve some genuinely jolting set pieces (Sarah Michelle Gellar’s final chase scene remains a seat-edge highpoint), there’s a lack of equivalent suspense with an uptick in gore used instead. The death scenes are certainly gnarly but there’s a rhythm that’s slightly out of step and Robinson is far more comfortable with the soapy mystery of it all, keenly aware of the franchise’s origins in high school paperback storytelling (the first was based on a 70s young adult novel) and there’s a propulsive snap to the Scooby Doo plotting (a character even references the show at one point). So while the double-bluff finale might lack tension (both sequences taking place in the daylight is a real atmosphere-killer), the gleefully absurd reveals almost make up for it. There’s something charmingly deranged about this kind of hyper-specific fan service, appealing to a select few with the brash confidence that everyone knows exactly what you’re talking about. There’s not only a surprise dream sequence cameo but a mid-credits sequence that’s one of the battiest fanfic indulgences I have seen outside of a Marvel movie (am I, a 90s teen who grew up on these movies, being ruthlessly, and successfully, targeted?).Early buzz has suggested that a younger audience doesn’t really know what happened last summer and an older audience doesn’t really care and so it’s possible that this will live on mostly as a pop culture curio. But at a time of nostalgia overload (Clueless,Legally BlondeandUrban Legendare next), Robinson finds a way to make her attempt not exactly necessary but unpretentiously pleasurable enough for that not to really matter. There might not be a next summer but this makes for an entertaining last hurrah.I Know What You Did Last Summer is out in Australian cinemas on 17 July and in US and UK cinemas on 18 JulyExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a core part of the culture and heritage that Tamimi hopes will help broaden the world’s understanding of what it means to be Palestinian.“Our dishes are being claimed by some Israeli chefs and so many native ingredients – lentils and sesame and greens – that I remember foraging for with my family are starting to disappear as access to our land shrinks. But this is our food, this is our history, our culture. You can’t take my memories away from me. You can’t tell me that this is not my land,” said Tamimi.Tamimi was born and raised in the Old City of Jerusalem, and grew up foraging in the surrounding hills with his parents for herbs, berries and greens – ingredients his mother would then use to create honest, simple dishes that were mostly vegetarian.After a long stint as head chef at Lilith, a fine dining establishment in Tel Aviv, Tamimi moved to London in 1997 at the age of 29 to work at Baker & Spice, where Yotam Ottolenghi, then a young pastry chef who grew up in the Jewish part of the Old City, also landed. The pair went on to create a hugely successful culinary enterprise including several restaurants in central London and together co-wrote the bestselling cookbooks Ottolenghi (2008) and Jerusalem (2012).View image in fullscreenEach recipe speaks to how much Palestinians love to forage, cook, preserve and eat food.Photograph: Courtesy of Ten Speed PressIn 2020, Tamimi co-wrote Falastin (2020), a love letter to Palestine’s ancient, diverse culinary traditions – and the people who have preserved the food amid unbearable losses.He rediscovered a passion for foraging in Umbria, Italy, which has a similar climate to Palestine, and began re-creating dishes from his homeland to stave off homesickness during the Covid pandemic. This helped sow the seed for Boustany, which means “my garden” in Arabic, that is steeped in childhood memories of staying at his grandparents’ home in Hebron in the southern West Bank, where the garden they tended with love delivered a bounty of fruits and vegetables each season.“The majority of our cuisine is based on vegetables, grains and pulses, and for me the whole process of cooking vegetarian food connects me back to the environment, to the land, to simple dishes – that could be just a bit of chard with some mackerel and a bit of onion and garlic,” he said. “It’s simple, not gimmicky, but really flavorsome and colorful and brings comfort because it connects me back to my family, to my heritage and all those beautiful memories. It was going to be a vegan cookbook but I couldn’t give up on cheese and eggs – especially for making sweets.”The 70-year-plus Israeli occupation and expansion intoPalestinian territorieshas severely restricted access to land, and foraging some native plants is actually banned by the Israeli state for Palestinians, while it fills the market with cheap Israeli alternatives. Olive trees, central to Palestinian identity, are frequently burned and chopped down by Israeli settlers in the West Bank; irrigation systems and wells are contaminated and destroyed; and for years fishers in Gaza have been denied access to Palestinian waters – and targeted with violence.View image in fullscreenTomato, za’atar and sumac salad.Photograph: Ola O Smit/Reprinted with permission from Boustany: A Celebration of Vegetables from My Palestine by Sami TamimiPreservation is an arc of this book, a deliberate though unsaid theme at a time when Palestinian food, land and culture are under unprecedented assault. This includes a pantry, ormooneh, chapter, a unique concept to Middle Eastern cooking, especially Palestinian and Levantine cuisine. Mooneh involves preserving (pickling, freezing, fermenting and bottling) seasonal products such as nuts, herbs, fruits, pulses and vegetables so they can be enjoyed throughout the year.But the book also looks forward, with new twists to traditional recipes inspired by Tamimi’s travels and evolution as chef over the past four decades. “For me it’s more important to take the essence of a traditional dish and build on it, by adding the layers and the texture,” he said. “But you shouldn’t play with the dish too much to ruin it.”Tamimi was in the final stretch of writing Boustany when Israel launched its unprecedented and relentless military assault on Gaza – in retaliation for Hamas’s attack on 7 October 2023. Israel has since razed the tiny territory, targeting the farmland, forests, olive orchards and greenhouses to stop Gazans from producing their own food while blocking humanitarian supplies – which together has put 2 million Palestinianson the brink of starvation.Last month, a French historian who made it into the territory to document the horrors hidden from foreign journalists reported that he saw starving childrensharing bits of food with scrawny stray cats.“Palestinian people are full of life, they always want to make you welcome and will push food on your plate just to make sure that you are well fed, happy and comfortable,” Tamimi said. “It’s horrendous for people that always celebrated life and food and seasonality and feeding people to be stripped from all of that, and for it to be used as a weapon against them.”View image in fullscreenEggplant and fava beans with eggs.Photograph: Ola O Smit/Reprinted with permission from Boustany: A Celebration of Vegetables from My Palestine by Sami TamimiPalestinian recipes always have a local spin. For example, the cuisine inGazawas uniquely influenced by its proximity to Egypt, so dishes are spicier, and the falafel is often made with fava beans instead of just chickpeas. Gaza’s version ofknafeh– a popular dessert that combines crispy pastry, sweet cheese and fragrant syrup – includes walnuts and sometimes bulgar or couscous. The seafood enjoyed in Gaza before Israel’s total siege – such as crab and squid – are hard to find in other parts of Palestine, and the strawberries there are the sweetest, said Tamimi.“There is another side to Palestinians that I want to show in the book. They want to eat and enjoy life, they want to live life to the max. Through food and these dishes I can connect with people who want to know more about Palestine and Palestinian culture. If there is something positive, with all the horrible stuff happening now, it is that it has opened people’s eyes.”Boustany: A Celebration of Vegetables from My Palestine, is available in the US and UK through Penguin Random HouseExplore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesOur unequal earthGazaFoodIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now she’s vying to be the university’s first female chancellor – all while going through chemotherapy. She talks about the attack that destroyed her own student yearsWed 16 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 10.08 EDTShareMy first question for Gina Miller is the same one I put to all interviewees – what did you have for breakfast? Since she’s not a chef or a famous foodie, but the businesswoman and activist who fought Boris Johnson over his Brexit plans, and is now standing for chancellor of theUniversity of Cambridge, this is more a journalistic ritual designed to test whether the recording device is working. But her response is startling.“I rarely have time for breakfast,” says Miller, who turned 60 this year. “I’m only just able to drink coffee again after my chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer, which is amazing. As my dose has just been reduced, I was able to have the one cup I’m limited to today.”The only outward clue that she is undergoing the treatment is a new Jean Seberg-style crop. She exudes energy and a zest for life.“I was diagnosed in September last year,” she says, breezily. “Actually, I should say ‘self-diagnosed’. I knew something wasn’t right with one of my breasts. The GP kept sending me away but after my fourth visit they agreed to a biopsy. I am so glad I listened to my inner voice that all was not well. It turned out that I had an aggressive form of the disease and had to have a very high dosage of chemotherapy from October to February. In March, I had a double mastectomy. I will be on the lower-dose chemo until December.”Since the recurrence rates are so high, Miller has opted for further surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes in January. “I don’t want to keep looking over my shoulder to see if it’s going to come back,” she says. “I’m lucky; I’ve had my three kids so I don’t need my female organs. If I get rid of everything, the prognosis is good.”In February, in the midst of what must have been an exhausting and stressful period, Miller was approached by a group ofCambridgeprofessors who asked if she might be interested in standing for chancellor. She initially said no, believing it was open only to Cambridge alumni, then learned that this was not a requirement. Still she demurred, but not because of her illness.“I told them I wasn’t interested in taking on a ceremonial role. I only want to do something that has a real impact because I think our country, and the world in fact, is at a particularly traumatic time in history. Cambridge has the resources, and the great, brilliant minds and standing as an institution, to contribute to the world and to us finding a more resilient and sustainable future.”Researching what scope the chancellor actually has, she discovered that the role includes the power to ensure that university officers are performing as they should be, and to resolve disputes where solutions can’t be found otherwise. “I came to the conclusion that although it has previously been a figurehead role, that could change. The chancellor sits on the university council so could act as chair. I decided I would throw my hat in the ring.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m disillusioned with our political system’ … Miller after a supreme court hearing in 2019.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/ReutersHow did she find the energy to do that while undergoing chemotherapy? “It’s true, chemo is gruelling. It’s not only the treatment, it’s the emotional side of it. Your appearance changes. Losing your hair, your eyebrows, your eyelashes, it changes the way people treat you and judge you as a woman. But although I suffered terribly with nausea, I didn’t stay in bed all day. I still tried to work for two to three hours a day and rested a lot, too.”I tell her the new haircut looks elegant and she laughs. “You never normally see the shape of your head. I think I have a weird double crown. But thank you.”Miller made hername in 2016in a landmark challenge to the government’s right to trigger article 50, formalising the UK’s exit from the EU, without a parliamentary vote, and then in 2019,successfully blocking a no-deal Brexitby fighting Johnson’s attempt to prorogue parliament for five weeks. Although you may imagine that a freethinking, remainer-leaning academic hub such as Cambridge might welcome Miller with open arms, her appearance on the 10-strongcandidate listhas ruffled feathers.For one thing, there has never been a female chancellor in the university’s 800-year history. To give a sense of the type of individual the role attracts, the previous two incumbents were Prince Philip, who was succeeded in 2011 by Lord Sainsbury of Turville. Apart from Miller, the only other female candidate is the comedian Sandi Toksvig. Also in the running are the former BP head John Browne and the former Labour minister Chris Smith.In his campaign statement, another candidate,the astrophysics professor Wyn Evans, wrote: “If Cambridge needs a high-profile or celebrity chancellor to be noticed, we might as well give up and rebrand the university as a reality TV show: ‘Keeping Up With the Cantabrigians’.”View image in fullscreenMiller at a march to rejoin the EU in 2023 withEuropean parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt, centre, and former MEP Richard Corbett.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockMiller is unimpressed: “Weirdly, the candidate who made the Kardashians comment is actually someone who is saying that the university needs to address its bullying and harassment issues.”There have also beencries of foul play,with concerns over certain candidates spending money on PR and social media, bad-mouthing opponents and using the university insignia to promote themselves, which is against protocol.In the run-up to the elections, Miller has been speaking to past and present students, professors, researchers and academics at the university. “The word that keeps coming up is complacency. Cambridge really needs leadership. Its ranking has slipped [from fifth to sixth in the world], and it needs to resolve the issues it’s facing. Behind the scenes there is disquiet, be it in terms of discrimination, short-term contracts, intergenerational unfairness and the coming austerity measures.”She says that throughout her life, education has always been “the anchor that has helped me to survive”. Her biggest inspiration was her father, Doodnauth Singh, who rose from being a petrol pump attendant in Guyana, studying law at night school, to become the country’s attorney general. “Education is what brought me to the UK, to a small boarding school in Eastbourne aged 11. Guyana was going through a dictatorship at the time and so I was sent to the UK to be safe. My parents were deeply passionate believers in the power of education.”But beyond all these motivations, she has a more pressing reason to want to contribute to the university’s future: “It just so happens that the type of breast cancer I have is a very rare genetic mutation, PALB2, which affects only 1-2% of breast cancer patients. Some of the scientists who discovered it are based at Cambridge University and I’ve got to know them, talking about the astonishing work they are doing and the medical advancements going on there. So I do feel as if I have a debt to repay them.”That the university needs strategic leadership is not in doubt.According to its internal watchdog, the university ran up a deficit of £53m for 2023/24 “with no clear understanding of what has happened or why”. It is expected to report a £47m deficit for 2024/25 and cuts of 5% have been instigated across the institution.View image in fullscreen‘I only want to do something that has a real impact’ … the University of Cambridge’s Trinity College.Photograph: Eye35.pix/AlamyCambridge has also been ranked the worst university in the country for the support it offers its disabled students,according to a recent study. “That is not good, especially when you have so many neurodiverse individuals. We need to tap into that brilliance, but that has to come with care and support,” says Miller, whose eldest daughter, now 37, has severe special needs.One of the biggest issues she is keen to address is wellbeing and safety support for students and staff. “There is a lot of pressure on individuals to perform in a way that excels at every level. But not much focus on supporting people to get there.”She says that she would advocate for each college having a properly trained psychotherapist and wellbeing support teams. “This isn’t just for students, it’s for staff. I’ve spoken to lots of young female researchers, especially those from ethnic minority backgrounds, about microaggressions and misogyny that is going on. They need an independent person to talk to. All schools and corporate environments offer this. Why doesn’t Cambridge University? It’s a false economy to run away from this.”Miller has very good reason to get behind this cause. In 1987, two months before she was due to sit her final exams for a law degree at the North East London Polytechnic, Miller was attacked by a group of four Asian men on campus.Even 38 years on, she is still visibly upset recounting the events of that night. “It happened on campus. It was cricket season and India had just played Pakistan. The Asian student societies were all celebrating. I had been studying in the library and when I left, I was intending to go to Mile End tube station. Four men spotted me. They had wrongly identified me as an Indian woman and accused me of dressing and behaving too western. They had seen me with Adrian, my white boyfriend. They attacked me.” She pauses, distressed. “I was raped.”She did not report the crime, nor did she tell anybody. “Like many cultures, in my community there is a lot of shame associated with crimes like this.”She stopped attending lectures. “I was completely broken and dysfunctional for at least seven months, probably a year. In my mind, I was going to go back to study when I felt better. My dream had always been to follow in my father’s footsteps, to become the best goddamn criminal barrister there was. Or maybe I’d go into family law. But after the attack, my dreams were shattered. In the end, unsupported, I just couldn’t face going back.”Instead, she moved to Bristol to set up a photographic business with Adrian, who became her first husband and with whom she had a daughter when she was 23. Later, she went to study marketing at the University of North London. Ironically, 30 years after she left the North East London Polytechnic (which became the University of East London in 1992), it awarded her with an honorary doctorate of laws in 2017.Inher memoir, Rise, Miller describes feeling an acute sense of “identity limbo” when she started law school. I wonder if this might explain the drive behind her hyperactive CV. She has campaigned on domestic violence, modern-day slavery and online abuse, as well as launching numerous business ventures. In 2024, she stood as a parliamentary candidate for Epsom and Ewell, representing her own political party, True and Fair, but lost her deposit.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve had a very eventful life’ … Miller at a protest against the Elections bill in 2022.Photograph: Thomas Krych/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock“I’ve had a very eventful life,” she laughs. “Education has always supported me, but life has educated me, too.” Along the way, she escaped a difficult second marriage, taking her eldest daughter with her and later marrying her third husband, Alan, with whom she has a son who is studying medicine and a daughter who has just sat her A-levels.But since 2016, her life has been lived against a backdrop of horrendous abuse. At the height of theBrexitlegal proceedings, her family were under the protection of the anti-terrorism squad. To this day, she is still at the sharp end of public vitriol. Why would she put her head above the parapet again? “I’ve considered this role really carefully. I think I have the bandwidth to do it.” She does add, though, that she is done with politics. “I discovered that it’s not for me. I’m disillusioned with our political system.”Before we finish, I ask Miller if she ever switches off, and she mentions her love of cooking, sharing with me a foolproof recipe for crispy aubergine, as well as dancing and music. Unexpectedly, she turns out to be an Iggy Pop fan. Was she a punk? “No! But I did like Chrissie Hynde. As for Iggy, I just love Lust for Life. If you want to understand my take on life, that is the perfect song.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Maskell and Duncan-Jordan spearheaded opposition to the cut to the winter fuel allowance and welfare reforms. Hinchliff organised a rebellion over the government’s flagship planning bill, voicing concerns about its effect on nature.Three other Labour MPs who have rebelled against the party whip – Rosena Allin-Khan, Bell Ribeiro-Addy and Mohammad Yasin – had their trade envoy roles removed.The decision was met with dismay from Labour backbenchers, who said No 10 had “learned nothing” from the rebellion against its welfare bill, in which ultimately47 Labour MPs broke the whipdespite the major concessions made by ministers. Starmer was accused of being aloof and disconnected from his MPs’ concerns in the wake of the row.One MP on the Labour left said those suspended had been told they faced an inquiry lasting a few months and that the decision had come from Downing Street.The MP said the move was intended to create a “climate of fear” in the parliamentary party and made the government look “brittle”. “What those MPs did, what we all did, was to defend Labour values,” they said.Commons at pompous worst as Afghan data breach proves too much bother for Badenoch | John CraceRead more“The fact that the government was humiliated was all of [its] own making. There are elements around No 10 who now want to lash out vindictively rather than acknowledge the mistakes that were made. This is now frankly a punishment beating … They’ve learned nothing. There’s no sense of self-analysis or reflection about how they could have done better.”Another Labour MP said: “Labour MPs now return to their constituencies for the summer totally demoralised by these petty and vindictive actions. I’m afraid if we have more arguments when we return on special needs provision and the lifting of the two-child cap, then things will only get worse. It’s dreadful politics and risks jeopardising the opportunity that such a massive majority presents.”A third Labour MP said: “The trade envoy sackings are particularly weird … There are Tory and Lib Dem trade envoys who vote against the government all the time and that’s OK, but a Labour one gets sacked for one rebellion? Make it make sense.”All four suspended MPs issued statements saying they wanted to remain in the party in response to rumours that they were in talks to defect to rival groups, such as thebreakaway party being formedby Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana.MPs who lose the whip are no longer considered part of the parliamentary party, though they retain party membership unless that too is revoked. The suspension is usually for a set period, and then reviewed.Maskell, who was a shadow cabinet minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said she had been suspended for “standing up for my constituents” over the benefits plans and that she was “upset that we are in this place because I believe we are better than that as a party”.Of the other three suspended MPs, all of whom are from the 2024 intake, Leishman is a member of the leftwing Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPs, while Duncan-Jordan and Hinchliff were both elected with very slim majorities in seats that have never before returned Labour MPs.Hinchliff said he was “proud to have been elected as a Labour MP and I hope in time to return to the Labour benches. In the meantime I will continue to fight every day for the needs of my constituents and nothing will change in how I engage with and represent those I was elected to serve”.Leishman said he wanted to “remain a Labour MP and deliver the positive change many voters are craving”.“I have voted against the government on issues because I want to effectively represent and be the voice for communities across Alloa and Grangemouth. I firmly believe that it is not my duty as an MP to make people poorer, especially those that have suffered because of austerity and its dire consequences”.Duncan-Jordan said he had “consistently spoken up for my constituents on a range of issues, including most recently on cuts to disability benefits. I understood this could come at a cost, but I couldn’t support making disabled people poorer.”Some MPs were privately scathing after an email was sent round the parliamentary Labour party from Jessica Morden, its chair, wishing colleagues a “relaxing break” and congratulating them for a “phenomenal” output just hours after the suspensions.This is the second time Starmer has enforced severe discipline on MPs who vote against his government, after removing the whip from seven MPs who voted with the Scottish National party to remove the two-child benefit cap in the king’s speech last summer.Those suspended from the whip last July included John McDonnell, Richard Burgon, Ian Byrne, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Imran Hussain, Apsana Begum and Zarah Sultana.The whip has since been restored to most of those MPs, though several on the left have continued to vote against the government on a number of issues including welfare, the proscription of Palestine Action and on changes to planning.Several of the leftwingers suspended last summer attacked the move. Burgon, the Labour MP for Leeds East, said ministers needed to change their approach “to help stop a Reform government”. Byrne, the Labour MP for Liverpool West Derby, said he was “appalled” by the suspensions as they risked “damaging Labour’s support and risk rolling out the red carpet for Reform”.Steve Wright, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, called the move a “dangerous and authoritarian act”.Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

The fertility regulator granted the first licence in 2017 to a fertility clinic at Newcastle University where doctors pioneered the technique.The four boys and four girls, including one set of identical twins, were born to seven women and have no signs of the mitochondrial diseases they were at risk of inheriting. One further pregnancy is ongoing.Prof Doug Turnbull, who was part of the team that spent more than two decades developing the procedure, said the healthy births were reassuring for researchers and the families affected. “You are inevitably thinking it’s great for the patients and that is a relief,” he said.Prof Mary Herbert, another senior member of the team, said to have eight healthy babies from the procedure was “rewarding for all of us”.The vast majority of a human’s 20,000 genes are curled up in the nucleus of nearly every cell in the body. But the fluid surrounding the nucleus contains hundreds to thousands of mitochondria that carry their own set of 37 genes. Mutations in these genes can impair or completely disable mitochondria with catastrophic effects.People inherit all their mitochondria from their biological mother. Mutations in the tiny battery-like structures can affect all the children a woman has.The first symptoms of mitochondrial disease tend to appear in early childhood as energy-hungry organs such as the brain, heart and muscles start to fail. Many affected children have developmental delays, require wheelchairs and die young. About one in 5,000 newborns are affected.Mitochondrial donation treatment, or MDT, aims to prevent children from inheriting mutated mitochondria. The procedure involves fertilising the mother’s egg with the father’s sperm and then transferring the genetic material from the nucleus into a fertilised healthy donor egg that has had its own nucleus removed. This creates a fertilised egg with a full set of chromosomes from the parents, but healthy mitochondria from the donor. The egg is then implanted into the womb to establish a pregnancy.How mitochondrial donation therapy worksThe first eight babies born to the procedure are described intwopapersin the New England Journal of Medicine. All eight were healthy at birth. One child developed a urinary infection that was treated, and another developed muscle jerks that resolved on their own. A third child developed high blood fat and a disturbance in their heart rhythm, which was also treated. The condition is thought to be related to a medical issue the mother had in pregnancy.Genetic tests showed that the babies had no or low levels of mutant mitochondria, with some carried over from the mother during the procedure. While the levels are considered too low to cause disease, it suggests the procedure could still be improved.“All the children are well and they’re continuing to meet their developmental milestones,” said Bobby McFarland, director of the NHS Highly Specialised Service for Rare Mitochondrial Disorders at Newcastle hospitals NHS foundation trust. Five of the children are less than a year old, two are aged between one and two, andthe other child is older.The mother of one of the girls said: “As parents, all we ever wanted was to give our child a healthy start in life. After years of uncertainty this treatment gave us hope – and then it gave us our baby … we’re overwhelmed with gratitude. Science gave us a chance.”Some women who carry the genetic disorders produce eggs with varying levels of faulty mitochondria. For them, a technique called pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) can be used to select eggs for IVF that have a very low chance of passing on a disease. Other women do not have this choice because all their eggs have high levels of mutations.The Newcastle team said eight of 22 (36%) of women became pregnant after MDT and 16 of 39 (41%) of women became pregnant after PGT. It is unclear why the rates differed, but some mitochondrial mutations may have knock-on effects on fertility.Writing in anaccompanying editorial, Robin Lovell-Badge, a principal group leader at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said the long road to this point had “no doubt been frustrating to women at risk of having children with mtDNA disease”, but praised the scientists’ cautious approach.Explore more on these topicsScienceHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The chair of the defence committee has indicated that he intends to hold further inquiries. I welcome that and hope that those who were in office at the time will welcome that scrutiny.”What are superinjunctions and why was one imposed in Afghan case?Read moreKemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, did not mention the Afghan scheme at prime minister’s questions, instead focusing her questions on the economy.Speaking afterPMQs, Starmer’s press secretary said Badenoch had been offered a security briefing about the situation in March, but refused.Badenoch’s spokesperson said that as opposition leader she received “innumerable” offers of security briefings, and refused this one as it was not marked as urgent. In June the issue was listed as urgent, so she sought a briefing, and was informed about the scheme on Monday, he added.Badenoch’s spokesperson was unable to say precisely how many briefings were offered, or to confirm if another shadow minister went in the Tory leader’s place, and was then unable to brief her because of the superinjunction.Downing Street refused to say if Starmer accepted the need for secrecy, but said the bar for such injunctions should be set “exceptionally high”. The prime minister’s press secretary said: “It should never be used to hide inconvenient facts or save ministers from embarrassment.” The data leak had highlighted “the total incompetence at the top of government” under theConservatives, she added.Asked about calls for a full public inquiry into what happened, Starmer’s official spokesperson did not rule this out, but said it was “right that parliament is able to scrutinise this issue in the first instance”.News about the previously secretAfghanistanResponse Route (ARR) emerged after a high court judge said the superinjuction had the effect of concealing discussions about spending “the sort of money which makes a material difference to government spending plans and is normally the stuff of political debate”.The ARR was created in haste after it emerged that personal information about 18,700 Afghans who had applied to come to the UK had been leaked in error by a British defence official in early 2022, potentially putting them at risk of reprisals from the Taliban.Ministers and officials at theMinistry of Defencelearned of the breach in August 2023 after data was posted to a Facebook group, and applied to the high court for an injunction, the first sought by a British government – to prevent any further media disclosure.Setting out the details of the scheme to the Commons on Tuesday, John Healey, the defence secretary, said Labour would halt the ARR, which will cost a total of £850m and will help an estimated 6,900 people.The decision to end the scheme came after a review into the repercussions of the data leak, led by Paul Rimmer, a retired civil servant, said that the acquisition of the data by the Taliban was “unlikely to substantially change an individual’s existing exposure given the volume of data already available”. It was unlikely, Rimmer said, that “merely being on the dataset would be grounds for targeting”.Explore more on these topicsMinistry of DefenceAfghanistanSuperinjunctionsConservativesKeir StarmerDefence policyImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

UK officials say the new law, expected to be passed by the end of the year, will give police and prosecutors the tools to target warehouses and logistical hubs used to store small boats and engines linked to Channel crossings.Police will be able to raid warehouses, seize assets and arrest facilitators even where no migrants are present, a move the UK government says will significantly disrupt the supply chain behind dangerous Channel crossings.This is a relatively late first visit for a German chancellor to the UK. Merz took office in May but officials on both sides say the delay was deliberate.In his first week, Merz travelled to Kyiv with Starmer, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, in a show of European unity. London and Berlin agreed Merz’s visit should coincide with the signing of the treaty.It is expected to be focused on mutual security, including cyber and hybrid attacks, stating that “there is no strategic threat to one which would not be a strategic threat to the other”.A senior German official stressed the treaty is not intended to “replace” Nato guarantees or interfere with a future UK-EU security arrangement, but added that Brexit had left “gaps” in coordination that needed to be filled.The agreement will also reaffirm an earlier plan to co-develop long-range weapons systems – following the Trinity House agreement in December – and includes new measures to improve youth and academic mobility.A senior German official said: “We will enable visa-free school group travel between the UK andGermany, increasing opportunities for language, cultural and academic experiences. We will introduce the new programme by the end of 2025.”The official added that both governments would “convene a joint expert group” to explore broader mobility solutions for “educational and scientific institutions, cultural institutions and political organisations”. While the scheme could serve as a future model for EU-UK cooperation, the official confirmed it would apply only to Germany for now.While the war in Gaza is not on the formal agenda, officials said the fallout from Donald Trump’s latest remarks on Russia – delivered just hours before Merz’s departure – could surface in private discussions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the far-right AfD gaining traction, the visit provides an opportunity to portray competence and reinforce Germany’s industrial and security networks beyond the EU.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyEuropeKeir StarmerFriedrich MerzGermanyFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s time policy caught up with this reality,” she said.About two-thirds of unpaid carers experienced material deprivation – defined as the inability to afford essential items such as food and energy – while carer social security benefits were often inadequate to protect family incomes, Resolution said.Despite UK family members effectively providing £184bn a year of unpaid care to loved ones, the value of carer’s allowance has fallen in the last two decades from 32% of full-time earnings at the minimum wage to just 19%, it found.Bringing the relative value of carer’s allowance back up to 1999 levels of 32% would boost the benefit by £53.45 a week to £136.75, at a cost of £2.9bn a year, the Resolution report said. An alternative would be to raise carer’s allowance rates in England and Wales to £94.60 a week, in line with the enhanced rates in place in Scotland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, there is currently no legislation that restricts the age at which you can buy nicotine pouches.The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) said the pouches currently fall between “regulatory gaps as they are not regulated as a specific tobacco or nicotine product”.Nicotine pouches, which contain nicotine, flavouring and sweeteners, are placed in the upper lip, allowing nicotine to be absorbed through the gum. Trading standards officers found they were in plain sight at checkout areas of many stores, with packaging and flavours similar to sweets and so made appealing to children, the CTSI said.According to a survey by Action on Smoking andHealth(Ash) carried out by YouGov, in 2024 only 38% of 11- to 17-year-olds were aware of nicotine pouches, rising to 43% this year.Duncan Stephenson, the policy and external affairs director at the CTSI, said the prominence of nicotine pouches “very much feels like a game of whack-a-mole”, because “just as one product is dealt with, another emerges.”Stephenson added: “While Trading Standards is working to ensure that the ban on single disposable vapes is in place, we are coming across new and emerging threats.“The availability of potentially harmful products being promoted and sold to our children seems never-ending. Nicotine pouches are the latest example, with slick marketing, sweet flavours and colourful packaging that risk appealing to young people, whether intended or not.“Local Trading Standards teams on the ground are uncovering these risks every day, but we urgently need the powers set out in the tobacco and vapes bill to take urgent and effective action. Strong, proactive regulation is essential to protect children and stop these products from slipping through the cracks.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not the top-down approach of the state working alone. Not the transactional approach of markets left to their own devices. But a new way forward – where government and civil society work side by side to deliver real change.”The government has highlighted the covenant as a way of putting charities and social enterprises at the centre of plans to provide publicly funded grassroots services in areas such as domestic abuse, youth services and employment programmes.But the covenant is expected to addresses more fundamental principles of civil society independence and rights, and commits the government and charities to continue to engage respectfully even where they disagree on policy.A key passage in the covenant is expected to say the government respects the independence and legitimacy of civil society organisations to advocate and campaign, will protect their right to engage in peaceful protest, and hold the government to account.The commitment was welcomed by civil society leaders. Jane Ide, the chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, said: “This is an essential part of a healthy democracy and speaking truth to power is central to the role of civil society.”There is widespread optimism in the voluntary sector that the covenant, which was negotiated in recent months, signals a genuine attempt by the government to embrace civil society groups and draw on their expertise to drive social change.One senior voluntary sector figure said: “This is something everyone has wanted to see for some time. It is easy to be cynical about words on the page but it is a massive opportunity to do things in a different way.”There is broad relief the covenant appears to signal that the tide of aggressive criticism of charities from rightwing politicians in recent years, seen as an attempt to undermine charities’ legal rights and restrict their role in public debate, has receded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it reflects growing parental dilemmas over the best way to start their children’s digital lives.Researchhas shown children with problematic smartphone use are twice as likely to experience anxiety and almost three times as likely to experience depression compared with those whose use did not resemble addiction.The launch of the device has been timed to coincide with the enforcement of strict new UK rules requiring robust age verification to access online pornography, starting on Friday next week.Chris Kaspar, founder of Techless, the US company launching the phone, said the default settings on most smartphones, which allow widespread access to apps and the internet, were “dark”. “Right now they are selling cars without seatbelts,” he said. “We want the defaults to be safe and healthy.”The devices will include an app store that is curated by Sage Mobile and will only allow users access to apps for tasks like banking, public transport, schooling, calendars and weather.Experience with a similar device sold in the US showed children used it for between 15 minutes and an hour a day, instead of average screen time in the UK of almost three hours a day among eight to 14-year-olds. Kaspar said children lose interest in it because “it’s not as magical, it’s not as fun”, resulting in many reclaimed “life hours”.But due to the high price it looks set to be a product sold in the thousands rather than millions. The cost results from a contract that can be cancelled at any time and the removal of the full app store and browsers, which create lucrative revenue streams.“Until now, this is still a niche market and people, especially parents, are not ready to pay a significant premium for a dumb phone,” said Thomas Husson, principal analyst at Forrester, a market research company.The product hopes to find demand amongparents pushing back against pervasive smartphone useamong children. Primary schools in Hampshire became the latest to ban devices this week.Similar devices sold under the Pinwheel and Balance brands are also available.Ban smartphones for UK under-16s, urges Adolescence writerRead moreDaisy Greenwell, co-founder of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, said it was very hard to find an effective way of stripping a phone back to make it fully safe for teens who were ingenious at finding new ways of getting around blocks.“There is real demand for something like this from parents, especially of teens who don’t want to be lumbered with a phone that sticks out like a Nokia,” she said.“But the price will be prohibitive for most people. It’s children from low-income families who are most at risk from harm online and £99 a month is out of their range. That’s not this company’s fault, but is a function of today’s digital ecosystem.“The government must make stronger policies to protect all children and not just those whose parents have enough money to do it themselves.”Explore more on these topicsSmartphonesInternet safetyYoung peopleChildreniPhoneMobile phonesApplenewsShareReuse this content"

They will hold the tail fin for a test model for the UK’s next generation fighter jet, which is intended to fly for the first time in 2027. The jet, known as Tempest, will act as a symbol of Britain’s hopes to remain a top-tier military nation and keep alive more than a century of building military aircraft.Yet things are markedly different in another hangar at the Warton site, run by British arms manufacturerBAE Systems. There, production of the Typhoon jet, a mainstay of the Royal Air Force (RAF) for two decades, has – for now at least – ground to a halt.Unite, a union representing workers, has raised concerns that the UK risks losing skills, but the company, Britain’s dominant weapons maker, insists that it will find new orders that will sustain jobs on the production line. Richard Hamilton, a managing director in charge of the Typhoon programme, told reporters at the plant this week thathe was “really confident” of receiving orders– but not from the UK. Instead, the UK government is trying to persuade Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia to buy more, which would secure the future of the assembly lines at Warton for as long as a decade.The questions over the future of the assembly line are emblematic of a trilemma that often seems to affect military procurement: the UK wants the best weapons; wants to boost British manufacturing, and needs to keep a lid on costs. Achieving more than two of those three aims simultaneously may be tricky, if not impossible.Keir Starmer last monthcommitted to raise defence spendingto the equivalent of 3.5% of GDP in line with Nato allies, but even that increase – paid for by a cut in international aid that was deeply controversial among Labour MPs – has not assuaged concerns over the UK’s future capability to make fighters. That was heightened by the UK’s recent decision to go ahead with an order of US-made F-35s – long-range stealth fighter jets.View image in fullscreenRichard Hamilton, managing director in charge of the Typhoon programme, said he was ‘really confident’ of receiving orders for the Typhoon.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe UK last month said it will buy 12 US-made F-35A jets that arecapable of carrying nuclear weapons, significantly adding to the UK’s nuclear arsenal. It also ordered another 15 F-35Bs, capable of vertical takeoff and landing. The jets are made by Lockheed Martin, but BAE Systems contributes communications, navigation and radar systems. Each F-35B version can cost as much as $109m (£81m), although the cost of the F-35A is thought to be about $83m.The UK carries out about 15% of the work by value on each F-35. But costs are also much higher than planned: the MoD estimated whole-life costs of £57bn for the F-35 programme, but the National Audit Office put the actual price tag at £71bn.Typhoon illustrates the way that European governments tried to keep the ability to make fighter jets while lacking the US’s economic power: the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain agreed to team up on the Eurofighter back in the 1990s, which meant fewer politically popular jobs, but also shared costs between several nations. The left wing is made in Italy, the right in Spain. Germany makes the central fuselage, while the engine is based on a design from Britain’s Rolls-Royce and front fuselages are built in Samlesbury, half an hour east of Warton. Each jet is then assembled by a prime contractor in one of the four countries, with BAE Systems as the lead for the jets bought by the UK. A 2011public accounts committee reportput the cost of each Typhoon at £73m – or £126m if development costs were factored in.Export compromisesBut BAE Systems also builds the planes ordered by allies via the UK government. Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia could order as many as 100 new Typhoons between them, Hamilton suggested, with about 50 more potentially assembled elsewhere.Hamilton also said that the government should commit to supporting upgrades to existing Typhoon jets with the latest electronics, such as new radars, encrypted communications, and new displays for pilots. Those upgrades would clear the way for customers to make the orders, Hamilton suggested.A source close to the defence minister, John Healey, indicated the government is likely to support the upgrades, which were recommended in the recent strategic defence review. The government is also confident in gaining more orders, the person said.Export orders give an easy financial win for the government – even if the Eurofighter never quite lived up to export hopes – but they will also force compromises on the Labour government, which has had to curry favour with countries who have faced persistent criticism over human rights abuses. Turkey is a member of Nato, but presidentRecep Tayyip Erdoğanhas pursued increasingly authoritarian policies, and hismain political rival has been given a prison term. Qatar has its own record of human rights abuses,particularly around treatment of migrant workers, and its criminalisation of same-sex relationships.View image in fullscreenCampaigners from across Northern England protest outside BAE Systems against the supply of parts for the F35 fighter jets used by Israel in the war in Gaza.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverMost notably, oil-rich Saudi Arabia became – briefly – an international pariah after the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. US intelligence agencies came to the conclusion that Saudi crown prince,Mohammed bin Salman, approved the murder. Saudi Arabia was blocked from ordering more Typhoons for several years by Germany, but the Eurofighter partner changed its tune last year after Hamas’s attack on Israel.The UK government showed that exports appear to trump human rights concerns in a supreme court case last month. Activists argued ministers had broken the law by allowing the UK to continue supplying F-35 parts for planesused by Israel to bomb civilians in Gaza. Government lawyers successfully argued that preserving the UK’s place on the F-35 programmetook precedence over the need to comply with UK lawson arms export controls, or any UK obligation to prevent an alleged genocide in Israel.Activists have also protested at BAE’s headquarters. Asked whether weapons exports could undermine political support for the defence industry, BAE’s chief executive Charles Woodburn this month said that “the UK has one of the toughest export control regimes in the world for defence exports, and everything we do obviously has to be entirely compliant with UK export control policy for defence equipment”.Tempestuous timesExports will also form a crucial part of the Tempest programme, anotherjoint project this time between the UK, Italy and Japan. It will be one of a crop of sixth-generation jets with advanced technology still under development. (The Typhoon and F-35 are considered to be fourth- and fifth-generation jets respectively.)At Warton, a scale model of the Tempest jet, officially known as the global combat air programme (GCAP), shows an aircraft three or four metres longer than the Typhoon, with an expansive belly to hide weapons and reduce its visibility to radar, as well as carrying enough fuel for very long range missions.View image in fullscreenA scale model of the Tempest fighter jet also known as the GCAP (global combat air programme). A proposed sixth-generation jet.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe promise of exports of the Tempest will again play a key role in justifying the upfront costs. The UK has committed more than £2bn to Tempest since 2021 and has budgeted more than £12bn for the programme over the next decade, according to parliament’s defence committee. It wants the first jet to be completed in a decade’s time – very fast by fighter jet standards. Delays could lead to the kind of cost overruns that have dogged big weapons programmes. There are also questions over whether crewed fighter jets have a long-term future, given the huge increase in drone warfare during the war in Ukraine.Tempest could also be competing with a Franco-German-Spanish rival, the Future Combat Air System – although that jet programme has been dogged by infighting between France’s Dassault and the German arm of Airbus thatbroke out into the open at the Paris airshow. But even if there are two European sixth-generation jets, plus the US’s Boeing F-47 announced this year by Donald Trump (the 47th president), BAE executives are confident there will be enough demand.Herman Claesen, BAE’s managing director for future combat air systems, said countries from “every continent” had inquired about buying the GCAP aircraft. TheUK’s arms export favourite, Saudi Arabia, has already asked to join the programme.“There’s a bit of a queue forming of various nations who want to talk to the governments,” he said.AMinistry of Defencespokesperson said: “The Typhoon is a world-class aircraft that will remain the backbone of the UK’s air defence until at least the 2040s.“The UK is leading Typhoon export campaigns to other nations, and we will continue to work on upgrading the RAF’s existing Typhoons over at least the next 15 years, both of which will support thousands of skilled UK jobs.”Explore more on these topicsMinistry of DefenceBAE SystemsMilitaryDefence policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

All names have been changed.AzizullahI worked with UK and coalition forces as an interpreter in Helmand and Kandahar for more than a decade.When I read the email on the morning of 15 July, I froze. It felt like my blood had turned to ice. Finding that the UK government hadaccidentally leaked the names and detailsof people like me – Afghans who had worked with British forces, who had trusted them, and who are now living in fear because of that trust.The first thing that flashed through my mind wasn’t myself. It was my family. My mother, my brother, my sister, they’re in Turkey right now, waiting. We’ve been waiting for four years under the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP), sending email after email, holding on to the promise that the UK would not abandon us. And now this. This breach. This betrayal.I am the one handing their paperwork and the only one aware until now about this leak. I still haven’t told them. How can I? My family has already lived through enough trauma. If I tell them what’s happened, I’m terrified of what it will do to them, not just emotionally, but physically. They will break. I know it.And it’s not just them. My aunt and her children are still inAfghanistan. They’ve worked extensively with ISAF (International Security Assistance Force)earlier and later, the coalition forces – UK and US troops both. They are in hiding now. If they are found, they will die. There is no question. We are not talking about hypothetical risk. We are talking about people being hunted, arrested, tortured, killed. And it’s happening now.They are going to die in that hell unless someone acts. And let me be clear: it is only the UK government’s responsibility to save them. This is their mistake. They owe us our lives.NaserI worked alongside coalition forces in Afghanistan – not just as an interpreter but also on security projects. When the chaos erupted at Abbey Gate in August 2021, I held a laissez-passer, but still, I couldn’t get on any evacuation flights. Since then, I’ve applied again and again to the US, UK, and EU governments for help. I even risked travelling to Pakistan, waiting there for over a year with no income and constant fear. Others working with me were relocated to Germany from Pakistan. I waited and watched as one by one many of my colleagues left. But life there [Pakistan] was unbearable, and I chose to come back to Kabul, because nowhere else treated us well.I didn’t even know thatemailswere sent yesterday. My brother got one and told me. The emails we sent with our requests over the years, our files, contained our pictures taken alongside Nato troops, our home addresses, and details of the security projects we worked on. All the information that could help us relocate was sent out. I’m terrified. How can anyone be this careless with our lives? The Taliban has been actively hunting down those who worked with UK forces. I’m not angry! I am ashamed that I put my children’s lives at risk for a foreign power.My family and I have been detained multiple times over the years – my brothers, my cousins and me. Back then, at least, I hoped the Talibandidn’t know everything about our past. But now? How do we protect ourselves if they suddenly produce a list? What if we deny it and they show us the proof in front of our eyes?The last 24 hours have been unbearable. Some people have received invitations from the UK government since 2022, but not us. It feels like we’ve been forgotten. I’m begging the UK government: don’t only help those stuck in Pakistan and Iran; please help those of us you worked with who are trapped here in Afghanistan. My children, my elderly mother – they only have me. Most of my family members have already left for other countries. I am here. I’m scared and lost.They [UK authorities] told us not to reply to emails, but to use the portal instead. Four years of waiting, and still no help. What hope do we have now? We lost everything in Pakistan – our savings, our dignity. Now, with no money and no evacuation flights, neighbours pushing us out, I wonder: are we not human? Don’t we deserve help?SameemI was granted refugee status in the UK in 2013 and I have since worked as a freelance interpreter for the Ministry of Justice and theMinistry of Defence, which included training British soldiers. My wife joined me in the UK and I applied to relocate my family – my father, brother, sisters – through the Arap [Afghan relocations and assistance policy] scheme but I was told they were not eligible.But my family are at high risk in Afghanistan because of their jobs. My father was a prosecutor for the Afghan government for many years. The Taliban killed one of my brothers in 2011 and another was shot dead in front of his two children in 2021. My family has been living in hiding since the fall of Kabul.Yesterday [Tuesday], I received an email from the UK government stating that my data might have been leaked. They provided me with a link to a self-checker and it showed that it had. It’s really concerning and frustrating because it means the Taliban can easily target my family now.I replied to the email saying: “My family were at high risk back home in Afghanistan and you didn’t help to relocate them, but now you’ve shared their data. If anything happens to them, who will take responsibility for that?” They haven’t replied to my email.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve already lost two members of my family. I don’t want to lose more.ShahThe spreadsheet, the superinjunction and the relocation scheme: Afghan data leakRead moreI know my name is on the list that was leaked because I was notified by the UK government that my details were compromised in a Ministry of Defence data breach. My family and I, living in Afghanistan, now face an imminent threat to our lives because of this breach. I believe that when that data falls into the hands of the Taliban it will lead to my arrest, torture and death. After the Taliban took over, I went into hiding because I had an important role in the courts bringing Taliban terrorists captured by the British to justice.Family members have been interrogated by the Taliban to try to get them to give information about where I’m hiding, so it is now too dangerous for me to have any contact with them. I have moved into a safe house because of the danger I’m in.In the spring of 2023, the Taliban’s interest in me increased. I believe this may be linked to the data breach. They tracked down my family but I wasn’t at home because I was hiding somewhere else. Since then many members of my family have been interrogated about my whereabouts. Contrary to what the British government is saying, I don’t believe the Taliban has ever lost interest in me. The worst part of all this is not knowing until this week that my name was on a leaked database that the Taliban may have had access to.AhmadI was on my way to a doctor’s appointment to seek treatment for a stress-related illness when the email from the UK government appeared in my inbox. I felt awful. I was already under immense stress due to my family’s situation, but this made things worse.Between 2016 to August 2021 I worked with NDS-D011, a unit of Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security (NDS) that was supported by British intelligence. After the fall of Kabul and my evacuation to the UK in 2021, I submitted the personal details of my immediate family – including my parents, two sisters, and three brothers – to the Ministry of Defence as part of a family reunification application.Despite over three years passing, neither I, nor any of my approximately 120 colleagues who also relocated to the UK, have succeeded in bringing our families to safety. I am part of a group chat with these individuals, and yesterday [Tuesday], 65 others reported receiving the same email acknowledging the data breach.Last night, we all contacted our families and warned them to take extra safety precautions. None of our relatives can live freely or safely in Afghanistan. Two of my former colleagues who were unable to flee the country were arrested by the Taliban about eight months ago and remain imprisoned. The Taliban consider anyone who worked with foreign governments a traitor and punish them accordingly. Can these governments guarantee that the Taliban will stay on their promise not to target our families?Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaMinistry of DefenceSuperinjunctionsMilitaryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You don’t need a language for this. It’s accessible in many ways.“Sometimes it gets exhausting reading all of the texts of all the artworks that you find interesting. But in an immersive setting, you literally come and sit in some art.”George the Poet chose Reflections on the Thames by John Atkinson Grimshaw, the enduring image of the moonlit river that runs through the centre of London.Alongside the immersive artwork that will be projected on to the walls, ceiling and floor of the space, are spoken-word pieces about the paintings, which were developed during workshops.The poet, who has worked with offenders in prison, believes art can broaden horizons.He said: “A lot of the conflict that I saw growing up was exacerbated by the feeling of not being able to leave the community, not being able to see beyond our immediate environment. One way to combat that is to invite new experiences.”View image in fullscreenThe Great Wave by Hokusai reimaged for Art of Expression at Frameless, the UK’s largest immersive art experience.Photograph: David Parry/ShutterstockA new piece of research was commissioned as part of the project, which surveyed 2,000 young people, asking them about their views on art and accessibility.It found that almost two-thirds of young people want more access to art, while a quarter said that art galleries “can be intimidating”.Nearly half said that historical art is not relevant to their modern lives, and when asked if they considered a career in the arts, 40% stated they did “not know where to start”.Tafari Clarke, a member of the Young People’s Action Group at the violence reduction unit, said: “Being an artist isn’t really glamorised like being a lawyer or being a footballer.

However, on Tuesday sheunveiled measuresto encourage people to consider the stock market as an alternative to banks and building societies.Here’s what’s on the table and how those with spare cash may take advantage of the changes.What is the government proposing?Outside of pensions, households typically held 32% of their savings in stocks in 2023, down from 38% in 2010. The government wants to reverse this trend, arguing that people are choosing to hold money in cash savings as a default, not as an active choice.By the start of next year it wants to roll out “targeted support” that would involve savers being contacted and told if there are investment opportunities that may suit them.It says lengthy risk warnings are deterring people from investing, and that there should be a move to “informing, rather than warning”.There will also be an industry-wide advertising campaign to encourage people to consider stocks and shares instead of cash deposits.What’s better about the stock market?Over time, it typically offers much better returns on your money than cash – for the government this means people are wealthier, and better set-up for events such as retirement.Figures from the financial advice firm AJ Bell show that if you had put £10,000 in a typical cash Isa 10 years ago it would be worth £11,513 today, compared with £17,999 if instead you had invested in a FTSE All Share tracker fund – this holds shares from hundreds of companies listed in the UK. Some investments would have grown even more over the same period.What are the dangers?Of course it’s not all pros and no cons: there is a risk with investing in stocks and shares – values can go down and even what may look like the safest of bets can go wrong.Railtrackand HBOS both seemed pretty stable companies for a while, before crashing.Buying individual companies is the most risky thing to do. You can reduce the risk you take by buying funds – these spread your money across a large number of companies.Another way to reduce your risk is to invest regularly rather than paying in a lump sum. Paying in a small amount every month lets you benefit from “pound cost averaging” – when the stock market is doing badly you get more shares for your money than when it is doing well. When it bounces back you stand to make more gains on those shares than those bought at the top of the market.How much should I invest in stocks?You should only invest money that you do not need in the short-term and that, ultimately, you can manage without.Antonia Medlicott, the founder of the website Investing Insiders, says before you start buying stocks and shares you should pay off expensive short-term debt on credit cards or overdrafts.“It’s also essential to build up an emergency savings fund to cover any unexpected costs without needing to cash out your investments early. An emergency fund also provides a financial cushion if you lose some or all of your money while investing,” she says.As a general rule, you should have at least three to six months of living expenses saved in an easy-access account – that could be your cash Isa.“Think carefully about your investment goal and how long it will take to achieve it. This will help you work out a realistic timeline for investing and how much risk you can afford to take,” she adds.How do I do it?Both individual shares and funds are available via banks and building societies, traditional financial advisers and stockbrokers, and online trading platforms. A lot of the online platforms have apps through which you can manage your portfolio. (Guardian Money recently ran aguide to the best ones for beginners.)The more help and advice you want, the more you will typically pay. Most companies that sell funds offer template portfolios made up of several funds. You will typically need to answer a few questions to show how much risk you are willing to take and whether you want to get an income from your investment or concentrate on it growing in value.Should I use my Isa?Investing in funds or shares is best done in your Isa because your gains are all tax-free. You can use anything left from your £20,000 annual Isa allowance or transfer money you currently hold in a cash Isa – make sure you get the provider to do this rather than withdrawing the cash and paying it in yourself.If you do invest outside of an I, you can make up to £3,000 a year before you have to pay capital gains tax. However, the tax treatment of investment gains could change in future.Explore more on these topicsIsasInvestment IsasStock marketsSavingsBanks and building societiesInvestingInvestmentsexplainersShareReuse this content"

Our mutual friend is counting down the days, but it’s news to me.I arrange my face into an expression of polite interest, imagining that they will soon move on. But they keep going – about Clara’s preparations, the drinks she’s ordered, the DJ.It’s not that I expect an invitation – I don’t know her well – but their focused discussion is starting to feel pointed, especially in the small city we share. I can’t help feeling left out.Finally, they turn to a new topic, but the interaction leaves me feeling uneasy and insecure, like I’d just been dragged back to high school.Is it true that I ‘don’t get angry’? Or am I actually dangerously suppressing it?Read moreWere they really excluding me, or should I have angled for an invite?New researchhas shed light on the psychology of “self-invitation”, and why people hold back from asking to join others’ plans. Psychologists staged eight experiments, involving both hypothetical scenarios and participants’ real-life experiences, and found that anxieties associated with “self-inviting” were rooted in misunderstandings about the organiser’s mindset.Namely, the study found that when we learn friends have made plans without us, we tend to overestimate the possibility that they had decided against inviting us, rather than just being preoccupied with other things.We also overestimate how irritated they would be if we asked to join. In fact, researchers found that, more often than not, organisers would prefer we did, and that including us had probably “merely slipped their mind”.When we jump to the conclusion that we’ve been deliberately excluded, we’re usually projecting our anxieties and insecurities, says Daniel M Grossman, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Missouri-St Louis, who co-authored the paper. “We’re not very good at reading others’ minds and motivations – or even our own, sometimes.”For example, we generally assume that we’ve been actively considered and discounted when, in reality, organisers are likely to have been busy with logistics such as finding a time that suits everyone or booking tickets.“We have this natural, egocentric tendency to overestimate how much people are considering us or paying attention to us in general – not just with invitations but also the clothing we wear, our appearance and our behaviours,” Grossman says.Sometimes, people are left out on purpose, he allows: “I don’t want to say that never happens.” But his study suggests it’s more likely that our names just didn’t come up, or the organisers didn’t think we’d be interested.After all, Grossman points out, if friends had really meant to exclude us, they probably wouldn’t be so open about their plans. “Organisers really can’t think about including everyone, to everything they decide to do. I think that’s an exhausting expectation to put on anyone.”Likewise, we hold back from asking to join in because we believe that would be irritating to organisers when Grossman found that – not always, but often – they would rather we did.That said, Grossman says, it can be nerve-racking to put yourself out there, even with people you’re close to.His research didn’t explore individual differences, but he suspects that traits like high self-confidence, low sensitivity to rejection and strong social belonging might make people feel more comfortable asking to be included.Conversely, those high in social anxiety, or “especially concerned with impression management”, may be more hesitant.Prior experiences may also play a part. “If you had one experience growing up when you said ‘Hey, can I join?’ and someone said no – these rejections really stick with us, especially when they occur at a younger age,” Grossman says.Feeling left out is the core fear of the teenager – hence why my run-in with Clara felt so adolescent. But we don’t have to stick with those internal scripts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most were more than accommodating, introducing me to friends and new circles. On the occasions when they politely brushed me off, I tried not to take it personally – I’d benefited from taking the chance and flexing my social muscle.Grossman says people routinely overestimate the discomfort, awkwardness or pain of social rejection. Even asking to be included is likely not as difficult (or excruciating) as they may imagine.Across their eight experiments, Grossman and his team tested two approaches to “self-inviting”: asking “That sounds like a great time – can I come with you?” versus stating, “I’ll join you”. The latter is less common and “a lot more assertive”, Grossman says – even “a little bit presumptuous”.Yet the researchers found the outcome was no different “whether the self-inviter asked to join, or simply stated that they would”.Grossman nevertheless recommends asking nicely – with an emphasis on the word “ask”. (I tend to drop obvious hints, like “I’ve always wanted to do that –andI’m free that day!”)More from Why am I like this:I’m an adult. Why do I regress under my parents’ roof?I like my own company. But do I spend too much time alone?People say you’ll know – but will I regret not having children?Grossman’s findings don’t necessarily mean that “all self-invitations are going to be met with open arms”, he adds: context such as the nature of the plans, the closeness of the relationship and the personality of the self-inviter “all likely play a role in how the self-invitation is received”. Additionally, the study only looked at casual, everyday plans, like going to see a film or for a walk in the park, rather than formal events with curated guest lists, like weddings.Still, Grossman believes the results should encourage us to take more social risks. “Overall, our findings suggest that many people are missing opportunities for connection out of this fear that oftentimes we find is overestimated,” he says.Organisers can do their bit by making invitations explicit, instead of assuming that others will infer that they’re included or else feel comfortable asking to come. “Just a ‘You’re welcome to come’ dissipates all of that,” Grossman says.ZGaming in their golden years: why millions of seniors are playing video gamesRead moreAfter speaking with him, I stumble upon a template on Instagram that lists “Activities I like being invited to”; it has been shared over 136,000 times, personalised with each user’s preferences. Some people signal that they’re keen for camping and clubbing but not karaoke; others are open to going for a run, but not to a bar.I am reminded of the different ways there are to spend time together, and feel inspired to take initiative, as Grossman suggested. Connection isn’t a zero-sum game, split between organisers and guests. Instead of waiting to be invited, or asking to be invited, we can also create more opportunities for socialising.When my friend mentions she’s going to try a new pilates studio, I don’t hesitate to ask if I can tag along. I’d have survived a rejection, but she says yes – and when another friend asks me if she can come too, so do I.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyWhy am I like this?PsychologySocial etiquettefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Where the@&^% is Thanet?It’s a peninsula on the north-eastern tip of Kent, including the seaside towns of Margate, Ramsgate and Broadstairs.Why can’t you swear there?Because Thanet district council doesn’t want you to.I see. And how do they plan to@&^%ing stop me?With a public spaces protection order (PSPO).What’s that?In effect, it’s an Asbo with a geographic boundary, in this case allowing police to issue fines of £100 to anyone “using foul or abusive language in such a manner that is loud and can be heard by others and cause either alarm or distress” in a designated area.I prize my right to free expression highly, but a hundred quid is a lot of money.It’s only £60 if you pay within 14 days.When does this come in?It hasn’t yet but, if the council passes the measure, the PSPO could be in place for three years.Has anyone tried to ban swearing before?Many times over many centuries. The Profane Oaths Act of 1745 introduced fines for the “horrid, impious and execrable vices of profane cursing and swearing”.I meant more recently.Thanet district council tried it only last summer.What happened then?Itditched the ideaafter the Free Speech Union (FSU) threatened to make it the subject of a judicial review.And what’s happened since?A rise in antisocial behaviour on the seafront has prompted the council to try again.I thought swearing was supposed to be good for you.It’s true thatstudies have shownswearing can improve your mood, make you more impervious to pain and increase muscle performance during exercise.And yet Thanetwants to ban it.According to Ch Insp Ian Swallow of the Kent police, this PSPO is specifically designed to target abusive language that is threatening and escalates trouble. “This is not a reference to casual swearing,” he said.I shouldeffing hope not.Anyway, it’s just the latest in a long line of attempts to curb foul language since PSPOs were first introduced in 2014.Did any of them work?Hard to say. Salford outlawed swearing in 2016, but dropped the measure in 2019. In that same period, 15 other councils used PSPOs toban foul language. In some places, they received public support and, in others, people campaigned against it.Do say:“One really ought to be articulate enough to cause people distress without swearing.”Don’t say:“A hundred pounds?

To let the anger in. On Tuesday, the Commons had been at its most pompous, most clubbable worst. Drowning in self-righteousness as the defence secretary, John Healey, gave a statement on theleaked Afghan email, the superinjunction and the £850m bill to the taxpayer.It was deeply regrettable, MPs on all sides agreed, but in the end probably just one of those things. Best to move on and not rock the boat. Parliament at its best and all that.On Wednesday, we got to hear Keir Starmer’s view on the scandal in his opening remarks at prime minister’s questions. He seemed to have moved on from Healey’s acquiescent cover-up. Yes, Labour in opposition had shared the previous government’s commitment to protecting Afghans who had worked for the UK army, but he had consistently warned of the Tories’ handling of the crisis. The failings were manifold and former ministers had a great deal to answer for. The gloves were off. This was a party political issue.And that was the last we heard about the cover-up.Kemi Badenochhad nothing to say about it at all. Not even in passing. Maybe she didn’t think it was that important. After all she couldn’t be bothered to attend an urgent security briefing about it back in March. Yes, she is that lazy. She only got to find out on Monday. But then almost everything is too much bother for Kemi. God knows what would happen if she wound up in Downing Street. Luckily, no one is about to find out.Or maybe she didn’t want to land Ben Wallace and Grant Shapps in it. On their watch, there had been several data breaches. It was almost embedded as part of the system. She could even have had a go at Robert Jenrick, who as immigration minister had been responsible for running a secret scheme to admit Afghans into the country while at the same time building a career based on hostility towards foreigners. Then Tories seem able to live with that level of hypocrisy.0:56Starmer says Tory ex-ministers have 'serious questions' to answer over Afghan data breach – videoWhatever. Kemi kept silent. But what of the backbenchers? Surely one of them would have wanted to have their say on a cover-up that had not only been kept secret from parliament and the public but from the very people whose data had been leaked. I guess the thinking was it’s best not to know if a Taliban death squad is after you. No. Not one of them. Not even Tory Lincoln Jopp, who picked up a Military Cross on active service and commanded the Scots guards in Afghanistan in 2010. Afghans? Lincoln didn’t remember them. Not today.It makes you wonder why these people went into politics in the first place. Was it really to be lobby fodder for the whips? To do as they are told on the off-chance they get a promotion to minister or shadow minister? Is that the summit of their ambition? A gleaming red box and the occasional use of a shiny black limo?This was a huge, huge story. A government using a superinjunction for far longer than was necessary. Not to protect the men and women whose data had been leaked: that information had almost certainly ended up in the hands of the Taliban years ago. But to cover up the previous Tory government’s blushes. Not just the leak but their embarrassment of running asecret immigration schemeat the time they were encouraging everyone to hate foreigners. So if not this, what do backbenchers care about? What will wake them from their comatose state?The kindest thing that can be said about the rest of this week’s episode ofPMQswas that it was like a third-rate panto coming near to the end of its run with its two stars merely going through the motions. Affected anger, pre-cooked put-down and a general lack of interest. Summer recess can’t come soon enough for Keir and Kemi. They have both long since run out of ideas. Just counting down the days till the Commons packs up on Tuesday.Kemi basically reused the same questions she had used at the last three PMQs. She may be a climate sceptic but she thinks highly of recycling her own ideas. Ideal for someone who has made a virtue of never doing more than was strictly necessary. Why go the extra mile when you can stay in bed picking fights on X? It also says a lot about her ambition. It hasn’t been as if her last three outings at the dispatch box have been a great success. More like a scoreless draw.Another mediocre stalemate at PMQs as neither Kemi nor Keir bother to engage | John CraceRead moreBut we are where we are. Two leaders who would quite like to be anywhere but in the Commons on a Wednesday lunchtime. Kemi going on and on about how the economy had been in tiptop shape last summer and had been tanking steadily sinceLabourtook over. Keir going on and on about the dreadful legacy Labour had been left and how things were now basically looking up. You could take your pick. Maybe things had never been that great and still weren’t.Not for the first time, one of the more interesting contributions came fromEd Davey. He talked of war crimes in Gaza and suggested Benjamin Netanyahu should be hit with sanctions. Starmer was like a rabbit in the headlights. He keeps saying how appalled he is, but his appalledness never reaches a level where he is actually moved to do anything about it. You can imagine him standing by an aid truck doing nothing while the IDF take pot shots at children, tears in his eyes as he says how appalled he is.The rest is best forgotten. Graham Stuart trying to be funny by comparing the Labour manifesto to The Salt Path and asking Starmer to name his summer read. It would be nice to report that Starmer saidTaking the Lead by John Cracebut he couldn’t think that fast on his feet. Jopp also fancied himself as a comedian by suggesting Jofra Archer and the England Test win showed Labour needed more pace and less spin. A gag that died on its arse as it was spin bowler Shoaib Bashir who took the winning wicket. Recess can’t come a minute too soon.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchPMQsKemi BadenochKeir StarmerJohn HealeyLabourConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

We know how that endsLarry ElliottThe chancellor’s emollient speech to City bosses this week was alarming. There are better ways to revive Britain’s fortunesWed 16 Jul 2025 10.42 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 13.53 EDTShareRachel Reeves was in full Iron Lady mode when she delivered herMansion House speechto the City’s finest this week. Regulation was acting like “a boot on the neck” of business, choking off enterprise and innovation. Cutting red tape would have a “ripple effect” on the whole economy. Regulators should not give way to the temptation of “excessive caution” but instead boldly regulate for growth. It could have been any Tory chancellor since Nigel Lawson speaking.If Reeves seriously believes this stuff she is heading for a rude awakening. Chancellors don’t need a crystal ball to tell them where financial deregulation leads; they can read the many books detailing what happened last time this was tried. The global financial crisis of 2008 came about because policymakers bowed to the pressure from big finance to sweep away “burdensome” regulations, pledging that more funds could be channelled into productive investment as a consequence.Instead of providing backing for startup businesses, easy money led to ever more reckless speculation and a giant credit bubble. The inevitable crash led to a deep recession, the bailout of the banks and – in a textbook example of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted – a tightening of regulations.By that point it was clear the Thatcherite experiment had failed. Britain’s manufacturing sector struggled while finance became an end in itself, abandoning what should have been its prime function: providing long-term capital for businesses. In their haste to liberate the economy, Thatcher and her supporters had ignored the warning delivered by Keynes in the 1930s. “Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise,” Keynes said. “But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation.”It is possible that Reeves is softening up the City with some deregulation now before walloping its high rollers withhigher taxes on wealthin the autumn budget. If so, she could justifiably argue that the better-off were the main beneficiaries of rising share and house prices as a result of the £900bn pumped into the economy by the Bank of England through its money creation programme. The FTSE 100 roseabove 9,000 pointsfor the first time this week.But while it would be nice to think the Mansion House speech was part of a cunning plan to squeeze the rich, it doesn’t feel that way. A more likely explanation for her deregulatory zeal is that the chancellor fears the economy is becoming stuck in a doom loop and in those circumstances any growth is better than no growth.Reeves is right to be worried because the economy is not in a good place. Activity as measured by gross domestic productcontracted in both April and May, while inflation picked up to3.6% in June.The increase in employers’ national insurance contributions has made businesses reluctant to hire and the public finances are in a bad state. Borrowing is high andthe U-turnson the winter fuel allowance and welfare payments, coupled with weak growth, mean Reeves is on course to break her self-imposed fiscal rule.To avoid doing so will require tax increases – and over the next few months there will be endless speculation as to how much will be raised and who is going to pay it. This is a rerun of last year, when the prospect of higher taxes hit both business and consumer confidence, slowing the economy in the process. There is an obvious risk that higher taxes stall the economy, adding to pressure for further austerity measures. Hence the doom loop.Borrowing more so that tax increases can be avoided might sound attractive but is fraught with risk. The bond markets have been keeping a close eye on the UK ever since Liz Truss’s disastrous premiership three years ago, and if Reeves did decide to break her fiscal rules the government would almost certainly end up paying more – and possibly a lot more – in debt interest. Historically, Labour governments have been at their most vulnerable to a financial crisis in their second and third years.So, it’s not hard to see why stronger growth is a more attractive option for the chancellor and there are ways of getting it. For a start, the Bank of England needs to sharpen up its act. With the economy on the brink of recession, the Bank’s monetary policy committee should be cutting borrowing costs by more than 0.25 percentage points each quarter.Threadneedle Street is also making life more difficult for Reeves by gradually selling back the bonds it bought under its quantitative easing programme in the 2010s and early 2020s. This is leading to lower bond prices and higher government debt interest costs than would otherwise be the case. This process – known as quantitative tightening (QT) – should be halted.It is also absurd for the government to be proposing cuts in welfare while the commercial banks are being paid interest at 4.25% on their risk-free reserves being held at the Bank of England. In 2023, NatWest, Barclays, Lloyds and Santander receivedmore than £9bn between them– a rise of 135% on the previous year. There are far better uses for this money.Reeves could order the Bank to halt QT and she could stop the payouts to the commercial banks. Judging by her Mansion House speech she would rather rely on the financial sector to dig her out of a hole. Good luck with that, chancellor.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)OpinionRachel ReevesEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Can you please tell his majesty to keep an eye on the post because my four-year-old has written the king a letter cordially inviting him to pop over to Philadelphia for ice-cream and “a big hug”. I’m not banking on this request being fulfilled, but I’m trying this new thing where I put my hopes and dreams out there in the world and wait to see what happens. (One hopes a restraining order from Buckingham Palace is not what happens.)To be crystal clear: sharing ice-cream with aristocracy is not one of mypersonalhopes or dreams. I think the monarchy is ridiculous. However, I seem to have inadvertently raised a staunch royalist who has developed a fixation on King Charles. I blame Elsa of Arendelle from the film Frozen for this. Likemany little children, my daughter had an intense Frozen phase, which led to her falling victim to the broaderprincess industrial complex. I then made the mistake of mentioning the fact that Britain has a royal family and showing her a clip from the coronation. She was not impressed with Queen Camilla (her dress wasn’t frilly enough), but Charles and his fancy crown stole her heart.As a feminist andrepublican(not the American sort), I can’t say I’m thrilled by all this but I’m letting the king-and-princess phase run its course while dropping subtle hints that doctors and sanitation workers add far more to society than people whose ancestors seized a bunch of land. I’ve also tried to gently explain that we live in the United States, a country traditionally hostile to kings.I say “traditionally” because Donald Trump, who is off to visit Charles at Windsor Castle later this year, certainly seems tofancy himself a monarch. Melania is also keen on royalty; the first lady has said she ispen pals with Charles, and the pair have engaged in deep conversations. Perhaps the US will get a King Trump in my daughter’s lifetime. It’s certainly more likely than universal healthcare. Anyway, long live the (actual) king and all that.

The tale they now tell is not reassuringPolly ToynbeeYears of austerity have destroyed the web of services that tackled this complex problem. Compared to our European neighbours, we are failingWed 16 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 11.06 EDTShareIt takes the passing of time to fully grasp the scale of the previous government’s vandalism.Think where we would be now had the Tories not dismantled the social programmes they inherited from NewLabour, with so many showing rapid progress. Those watching the statistics had a jolt last week when figures from the Office for National Statistics for 2022 seemed to show the second annual rise in teenage pregnancies in England and Wales, after a decade of falling rates.This may turn out to be the result of pandemic distortions in the previous year, when numbers dropped due to teens not meeting. The next figures may return to the previous trajectory, but that’s still a sluggish rate of falling teenage conceptions and it throws into stark perspective how far Britain lags behind similar countries. The UK now has theseventh highestunder-18 live birth rate out of the 27 EU countries and us. Many of these countries’ rates are falling faster, while ours lags, largely due to our exceptionally high level of inequality. Had New Labour’s remarkable programmes around social exclusion been doing their work through these wasted Tory years, we may no longer be such a social laggard of the western world.It’s worth recounting what was lost. As soon as Labour came to power in 1997, it founded the social exclusion unit, with 18 taskforces pursuing the causes of deprivation. Truancy, bad housing, juvenile crime, debt, mental ill-health, addictions, rough sleeping, school expulsions, youth unemployment and teenage pregnancy each had a dedicated team seeking out social research. Their results were recorded each year in the index of multiple deprivation, an annual Domesday Book of the dispossessed.In 1997, halving teenage pregnancies was regarded as one of the hardest targets. That type of deeply complex social behaviour seemed beyond the reach of the state. To start with, Labour had to take on the bogus moralising among a particularly nasty cohort of Tories. The outgoing Conservative government had imposed the section 28 ban on schools discussing homosexuality and gave parents a legal right to remove children from sex education. In 1992, Peter Lilley, the minister for social security,sang a dittyabout “single mothers who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue”, while John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, castigated single mothers in Cardiff the following year as “one of the biggest social problems of our day” (“The assumptionis that the illegitimate child is a passport to a council flat,” he said). Moral blame was an excuse to cut lone parent benefits, a last-minute pre-election trap that Lilley bequeathed to the New Labour government, forcing Labour MPs to carry it out, pledged to stick to Tory spending plans.What worked was tackling all causes at once, from child poverty to school absence, alcohol use, poor sex education, a lack of access to contraception, mixed messages about sex, dismal future prospects and the impact of spending a childhood in care. Alison Hadley, who led New Labour’s teenage pregnancy taskforce, explains in her bookTeenage Pregnancy and Young Parenthoodwhy this matters: young mothers and their children tend to do badly, suffering from higher maternal depressionand higher infant mortality, with children left with a delayed verbal ability and a worse life outlook. What helped was raising the school leaving age, girls staying on until 18, going to college with an array of courses that raise aspirations and an education maintenance allowance paid to the poorest.Pastoral care at school improved, with school nurses dispensing the morning-after pill. So, too, did sex education. Alcohol use among young people fell. Youth services grew, with Connexions offering 13- to 19-year-olds everything from mental health support to careers advice. School absence rates fell as the curriculum became more flexible and fun, with a wider range of subjects and activities. Sexual health clinics for young people opened, with sessions suiting school hours. All of these were attacked by the moralisers as likely to cause an explosion of young sex. But instead, the opposite happened: the number of young people who said they had had sexual intercoursedecreased substantiallyamong boys and girls, and there were fewer conceptions.‘We’re told we won’t amount to anything’: is it possible to change the fortunes of young people living in England’s coastal towns?Read moreWhen a new government took power in 2010 and axed the programme, so many of these improving indicators went backwards.In the intervening years, teenage pregnancy rates had still been falling, though far more slowly than in comparable countries as so many key services have been lost. Brook’s special sexual health clinics for the younghave closedin places such as Wirral, Burnley, Southwark, Liverpool, Lambeth and Oldham. The Connexions youth service was abolished. Schools cut drama, sport, music, arts and technical subjects as Michael Gove’s curriculum reforms sidelined anything but his five-subject Ebaccs. In England, attendance fell and school expulsions rose, as did the off-rolling of pupils who were likely to reduce a school’s results, all reasons for Britain falling so far behind. The poorest places still have the highest rates of teenage pregnancy: there is still aseven-fold differencein rates between well-off and destitute areas.And those nasty attitudes still lurk on the Tory right among the likes of Danny Kruger, who has called for a return to “normative” family values. The former Tory MP Miriam Cates was forever attacking sex education with grotesque parodies of what was taught. She asked Rishi Sunak at prime minister’s questions if he knew about “graphic lessons on oral sex, how to choke your partner safely and 72 genders – this is what passes for relationships and sex education in British schools”, then demanded he launch an independent inquiry, whichhe duly did, a month before the last election. What did it take to address the problem? Everything.But the unit is a hopeful reminder that what was done before can be done again. Today, the education department issues bolder broader sex and relationships education guidance, a good sign, bringing schools closer toencouraging their studentsto think and talk about relationships, misogyny, pornography, bad influencers and internet threats.All of this has been recorded byMoira Wallace, a permanent secretary who became the head of the social exclusion unit from 1997 to 2002, who say she “watches like a hawk, not an ostrich” the progress or often backsliding of those programmes. Herrecent surveyon school absence shows the number of students persistently missing is rising sharply, linked to multiple bad outcomes, especially teenage pregnancy. Not everything in her social exclusion unit hit its goal, but many areas did, with action on teenage pregnancy exceeding its target, and youth employment, rough sleeping and early years metrics among other notable successes. The unit’s ambition propelled an optimism about what can be done. Lessons to be learned? Nail down improvements in the public mind, so no future government dares commit such social sabotage again.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 16 July 2025. An earlier version said that the UK had 22nd-lowest teenage pregnancy rate out of the 27 EU countries. In fact, this figure, which is the seventh highest in the EU, is for the number of live births to under-18s.Explore more on these topicsTeenage pregnancyOpinionYoung peopleLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Now shehas gone “by mutual agreement”.Crew’s first problem was that she followed a genuine corporate superstar in the form ofthe late Sir Ivan Menezes, whose strategy of “premiumisation” – encouraging punters to drink more expensive stuff – did wonders for profit margins year after year. Any successor would have found it hard to match his record.Tariffs are clearer at Diageo – not much else is | Nils PratleyRead moreSecond, she started with a thumping profits warning in November 2023 – a proper shock to investors – and explained it badly. The cause was overstocking in Latin America in the post-Covid period, but it was never entirely clear howDiageocould have been so badly informed about the mismatch between stocks held by local distributors and how much tequila and whisky was actually being consumed on the ground. As the former chief operating officer, Crew could hardly blame others.Third, she waited too long to ditch financial guidance, inherited from Menezes, that was plainly out of date. After Covid’s locked-up booze fest and the post-pandemic party period, the spirits market became harder to read when consumers turned more cautious. Clinging to “medium-term” sales growth of 5% to 7% while turning in numbers as low as 0.6% added to the sense of drift.Fourth, even when Diageo came up with a cost-cutting plan in May, pledging $500m (£370m) of savings, it was the new finance director, Nik Jhangiani, who got the credit in the eyes of City. While Crew talked about “largely macroeconomic” factors at work, the incomer sounded more attuned to the reality that Diageo was living in a harsher operating climate. Only the ever-reliable Guinness brand has proved immune.Fifth, a new chair, Sir John Manzoni, arrived in February, which was always going to be a moment of danger for a chief executive who had overseen a 40% fall in the share price. Thus Crew’s immediate exit lacks shock value. When you’re getting fixed pay of £1.7m out of total remuneration of £3m last year, you’re vulnerable. The removal process sometimes should be unsentimental, just as it was at Unilever,where the last boss lasted only 18 months.That is not to dispute that the macroeconomic forces are genuine. The spirits market has weakened and Pernod Ricard’s share price looks as horrible as Diageo’s. Complicating factors include Gen Z’s lower appetite for alcohol than their parents’ generation, slimming drugs’ possible effect on drinking habits and Donald Trump’s ever-changing tariffs.Yet it is still hard to shake the feeling that Diageo could do more to help itself. From an annual sales base of $20bn, is $500m of cost savings really all that can be found? A lot of corporate fat may have accumulated over 20-odd years of success – the definition of leanness may have to be sharpened. Should it take until 2028, as pitched in May, to get the debt ratios within the desired range? Disposals have been promised, but the timetable looks leisurely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And with that the question of the point of your life is answered. Nobody, I suggest, ever expresses doubt about the purpose of doctoring. Just like nobody asks a broadcaster and writer what the point of their work is. They should. We get too much credit for what we do.Not long after I started presenting television programmes, I was invited back to my old school’s speech day to give a talk. This was barely 10 years after I’d left the place, and so many of my teachers were still there. That evening remains one of the proudest days of my life.As I shook hands with the students collecting their prizes, I thought about what they’d go on to do with their lives. And then I thought about some of the wonderful things many of my own cohort were achieving. And then I thought about what I was doing here rather than any of them. Medics, engineers, aid workers, lawyers, builders and so on. Yet I was the one who’d got the nod. Don’t get me wrong, I was proud of where I’d got to in my life, yet even then it felt as if my line of work conferred upon me an elevated status it didn’t quite warrant. As I said, a bit too much credit.Here’s why I feel this way: I’m often recognised on the street, in a pub, at a football match or wherever, and asked about my work, in the most generous of tones.

Their response is as interesting as it is disappointing.View image in fullscreenHealthcare professionals – be proud of what you do!Photograph: Halfpoint Images/Getty ImagesFirst, they doubt my sincerity in asking the question. They think I’m just being polite, but they are quite wrong. I am always genuinely interested. Occasionally, by the way, there’s even a bit of mind-your-own-business in their response, which is a bit rich given they started the conversation.Anyway, on we go. I’m all ears. And when I do get my answer – and this is the disappointing bit – I would say that nine times out of 10 I get an apologetic shrug and a sentence that typically begins with something like, “Oh, I’m just a …” Accountants, bless them, are particularly apologetic about their work. But, whatever the person does, it’s as if it couldn’t possibly compare to what I do.Nothing, in my estimation anyway, could be further from the truth. I’ve had some extraordinarily high-status jobs shared with me in that dot-dot-dot slot. Doctor, barrister, airline pilot etc. This is daft.

From the moment that architectLeslie Greenunleashed his first station facades of gleaming oxblood-red terracotta tiles on to the streets of Edwardian London, the tube has offered a masterclass in the power of design to represent a truly public service.The famous roundel badge, designed by 1917 by Edward Johnston, who also created the network’s classic typeface, has become one of the most recognisable logos in history.The tube map, first drawn up by Harry Beck in 1933, is a stunning model of stripped-back clarity that has influenced transport maps the world over.The graphic moquette seat fabrics, introduced in the 1920s, are so adored that they now cover cushions, scarves and tote bags. To this day, the overall design of the Transport for London (TfL) network is an essay in legibility, consistency and coherence, enjoying a level of brand recognition that is the envy of corporations the world over. It is a visual identity that ties the entire city together, more than any urban branding exercise could ever hope to achieve.Now that cohesive design hangs in the balance. Last week, ina short LinkedIn post, TfL offered an opportunity for the “exclusive sponsorship” of the Waterloo & City line, in a deal that “goes far beyond a typical media opportunity”. The “full-line branding”, it continued, will extended “from moquette seat fabric and signage to maps and experiential spaces”, offering brands the unique chance to “own the journey” from Bank to Waterloo – a route plied daily by thousands ofthe Square Mile’shigh-net-worth decision-makers. “Ready to create standout, shareable moments on the underground?” the post asked, with a little red heart emoji.The cash-strapped tube operator is no stranger to branded takeovers. But this latest move represents by far the most complete submission to commercial sponsorship, opening the doors for private funds to creep ever further along the network, and to shrink-wrap every available surface of the commute in monetised messaging.Conservative mayor Boris Johnson was the first to begin the great sell-off, when his costly cable-car vanity project was rebranded asthe Emirates Air Linein 2012. The deal saw a private company’s name adorn the tube map for the first time, for the price of £3.6m a year. The value of this novelty soon wore off, once it became clear that few regular commuters took the ride. The current sponsor, IFS, pays just £420,000 per year for the naming rights to the mostly empty dangleway.More recently, TfL raised eyebrows last year when it plumbed the uncharted depths of immersive advertising by changing the actual names of two tube stations.The half-a-million-pound dealsaw Bond Street renamed Burberry Street, and Old Street rebranded Fold Street, to mark the launch of a Samsung phone, each for a few days. The publicity stunts were slammed at the time byTransport For All, an organisation representing passengers with disabilities, which said that “thoughtless PR stunts being used to plug holes in TfL funding cannot be at the expense of accessibility and safety for disabled passengers”.Last week’s announcement has raised similar concerns. The Greater London assembly’s Liberal Democrat leader, Hina Bokhari, described the decision as “a disgrace”. She said: “Rebranding stations may seem like a bit of harmless fun, but for neurodivergent Londoners and visitors, of whom there are many, it can cause genuine confusion and distress.”Alongside raising questions of accessibility, the latest move goes against the very essence of what makes the tube so beloved, and so successful – both as a brand, and as a shared public service in Londoners’ collective psyche. In our increasingly privatised capital, where streets are patrolled by the guards ofbusiness improvement districts, and outdoor space is often only publicly accessible at the invitation ofprivate landowners, the public transport network is one of the few lasting bastions of a civic commons. And its clear visual identity, free from wraparound vinyl decals, sponsored seat covers and “experiential” marketing installations, has been central to its success as a beloved public service.Much of the power of the tube’s identity can be credited toFrank Pick, who shaped the look of the tube network in the first half of the 20th century, and saw good design and visual clarity as a public duty. A solicitor turned publicity officer, Pick understood the power of total design, from the architecture of stations to the look of the signage, to the design of the posters promoting far-flung places that were now in reach, thanks to the miracle of the electric railways. He was the one who commissioned Johnston’s roundel and endorsed Beck’s map, as well as hiring architectCharles Holdento design a series of strikingly modern stations in the 1920s and 1930s, such asSouthgate’s art deco UFO. In Pick’s eyes, design was not just a matter of aesthetics, but an essential tool for elevating the everyday passenger experience and contributing to the overall quality of city life.“The test of the goodness of a thing,” said Pick, “is its fitness for use. If it fails on this first test, no amount of ornamentation or finish will make it any better; it will only make it more expensive, more foolish.”TfL’s attempt to flog the Waterloo & City line might plug the funding gap for a few months, but it is a foolish sticking plaster that could ultimately do more harm than good. Commuters can look forward to a future of riding the Nike Northern Line, with an air-cushioned spring in their step, or taking the Amazon Prime Piccadilly,making you take journeys you never knew you needed.Oliver Wainwright is the Guardian’s architecture and design criticExplore more on these topicsLondon UndergroundOpinionLondonDesignEnglandRail transportTransportcommentShareReuse this content"

After spooking markets with tears in the Commons, appearing with the Bank of England governor was damage control. The “Leeds reforms” were billed as bold, but the real message was a return to business as usual.Delivered to a City audience, thespeechconfirmed a deregulatory tilt that is striking not for its boldness but for its familiarity. Her “reform” of theringfencing regimefor banks is code for loosening constraints under pressure from the finance lobby.Streamliningthe regime brought in after the 2008 crash to hold bank leaders personally responsible for regulatory breaches will weaken post‑crisis accountability standards.One of the City’s regulators, the financial ombudsman, will be reined in after industry gripes that its consumer-friendly stance over complaints has exposed banks to compensation claims worthbillions of pounds. Mortgage borrowing caps are being eased, allowing lower-income buyers to stretch their finances further. And most revealingly, the Treasury will launch a nationalcampaignnext spring to promote stock market investing – because, in 2025, betting on stocks is public policy.It’s a curious prescription for an economy whose GDP per head has grown more slowly than any other major high-income country since 2008. A new government promising change might have offered a broader rethink. Instead, it has given us rightwing tropes about red tape being the “boot on the neck” of business. Today’s financial sector is less a source of productive capital than a machine for asset inflation, propertyspeculationandleveragedbuyouts. Encouraging households to put their savings into equities, or to take on larger mortgages, will not fix Britain’s broken growth model. It will simply shift more risk on to households already burdened by wage stagnation and unaffordable housing.Pushing stock ownership as financial inclusion shows just how Labour hasinternalisedthe logic of private enterprise. The state won’t raise living standards directly, so individuals are nudged to become their own portfolio managers. This will do little to address the technological and organisational drift of the economy. But it highlights Ms Reeves’s deeper misdiagnosis that Britain’s stagnation stems from overregulation, notunderinvestment; from hesitant consumers, not cautious governments. The real barriers to growth – weak demand, low public investment, regional imbalance – go unaddressed. So too does the self-imposed fiscal straitjacket that constrains state action.The Leeds reforms may boost asset prices, but undermine balanced regional growth. They will enrich the City, not the nation. Instead of building a resilient, innovation-led economy for all, they revive the ideology ofasset-led prosperityfor the few. They claim financial markets will backfill decades of underinvestment. History suggests they won’t.A world-class financial centre isn’t the problem – until its priorities outweigh the public’s. Reeves says that her reforms will “ripple” through the economy. But beneath the City-friendly gloss lies a misplaced faith in trickle-down economics – the very model that drove deindustrialisation,inequalityand financial crises. Real wages arerisingnow, lifted byfiscalstimulus, but that can’t undo 15 years of stagnation. The issue isn’t too much state action – it’s too little. Asking households to fix growth by becoming part‑time speculators isn’t a plan. It’s a cop-out.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The email containing a highly sensitive dataset was sent from a Ministry of Defence computer in February 2022. Ministers were not aware of the problem until August 2023.The fact that the MoD’s systems were lax enough for the error to have been made is worrying enough. The delayed response is more alarming still. And then there is the disturbing mechanism by which the whole scandal was kept from the public eye.There was an argument on safety grounds for keeping the existence of the leaked list secret. Applicants to the Afghan relocations and assistance policy (Arap), a scheme to expedite asylum for people who had worked with British forces in the country, would be natural targets for vengeful Taliban hit squads. A judge deemed the risk severe enough to grant the MoD’s request for an injunction on reporting the breach and upgraded it to a “superinjunction” – a prohibition on reporting the existence of reporting restrictions.This powerful suppressive tool is usually associated with cases of celebrities guarding their privacy, and even then it is controversial. There is no known precedent for its deployment to protect the government from scrutiny in a case of manifest public interest.Mr Justice Robin Knowlestook the view that the Arap applicants’ right to safety should take precedence over the freedom of the press to report the leak.That may have been a worthy argument in 2023 – but not in perpetuity. However, ministers regularly sought to renew the superinjunction, citing increasingly spurious premises. It was almost removed in May 2024, but restored on appeal. It was onlyliftedthis week after an internal government review, commissioned by the defence secretary, John Healey, found that being identified in the data breach should no longer be considered a matter of life and death. It would “simply be another factor in exacerbating a person’s existing vulnerability”.How, why and when the balance of risk shifted is unclear. It happened over many years under multiple defence secretaries, straddling a change of government. Over the same period, hundreds of millions of pounds were spent onan emergency resettlement schemefor people affected by the data breach – an expensive policy on a matter of great political sensitivity run entirely below the radar of parliamentary scrutiny or any other mechanism of accountability.Meanwhile, many of the legal arguments that led to renewal of the superinjunction were held in closed court. The grounds for keeping the blanket of secrecy in place were themselves wrapped in an extra layer of secrecy. Such a process goes against fundamental principles of open justice. In an era of depleted trust in politics, its deployment to keep a serious scandal from public view is also corrosive of democracy. A dangerous precedent has been set.Lifting the superinjunction doesn’t in itself bring transparency. But it does at least permit overdue questions about how the data breach happened, the timeliness and effectiveness of the MoD’s response, and why no one has been held to account. The current Labour government was not responsible for keeping the public in the dark for so long, but it will be judged on its willingness to let the light in now.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Two stagings inside a decade was always the plan as the R&A determined Northern Ireland could host an event of this stature. There will be a third, it just seems unlikely to land imminently. Muirfield is long overdue an Open return, so too is Royal Lytham & St Annes. When Dublin’s Portmarnock is added to the upcoming mix, Royal Portrush will be required to wait in line.There will be a determination on the Causeway Coast to make the most of the opportunity in this, the 153rd Open staging. The Dunluce Links is a world-class venue, one which will reward only the finest ball strikers as the jousting for the Claret Jug concludes on Sunday evening.R&A held talks with Donald Trump’s son over staging the Open at TurnberryRead moreThe Masters should always be the easiest major to call, such is the small field combined with a necessity for Augusta National specialism. The US Open revels in being attritional, occasionally –as at Oakmont last month– to the point of silliness. The US PGA Championship takes place on such a variety of courses that it has no distinct identity. At the Open, there is a routine element of unpredictability that makes it so fiendishly difficult to envision before a ball is whacked in anger.This can be as general as in the draw – where one half gains a meaningful weather advantage over the other – or as niche as a bounce. The randomness of links golf means half a yard can equal a menacing bunker lie, from which a round can unravel.Portrush, a site offering such natural and stunning beauty, grabs the attention from the outset. The opening tee shot is the trickiest on the Open rota. Out-of-bounds poles line up right and left. With crosswinds almost a constant and the stakes so high, this is the antithesis of a soft start. Any player trying to attack the front left of the green and landing short will watch their ball trickle back into a horrible, perfectly positioned sand trap.Six years ago, Rory McIlroy’s eight on day oneturned heads. The reality is that is not an altogether difficult thing to do.There is opportunity thereafter. The 2nd is a generous par five. The severe 4th is followed by a friendly 5th. The 8th, 10th and 12th are unlikely to faze the world’s best. AsShane Lowry demonstratedwhen placing daylight between himself and the field on Saturday in 2019, the closing stretch can be whacked into submission.View image in fullscreenJon Rahm has three top-10 finishes at the Open in the past four years and has won twice in Northern Ireland in regular tour events.Photograph: Pedro Salado/Getty ImagesOpen participants will be cheered by the fact that, while Thursday looks wet, wind forecasts are not particularly high over all four tournament days. This has scope to be a low-scoring Open. Portrush is no Carnoustie. With this comes an element of thrill.In the buildupMcIlroy has been cheered from tee to greenby giddy audiences. His following here is worthy of comparison with what surrounded Tiger Woods in his pomp. If McIlroy finds himself in the mix come Sunday, the spectacle will be extraordinary. His afternoon tee time on Thursday appears literally in the eye of a storm. While logic suggests this should be problem, could the local hero take to a benign course after an enforced delay? The Open is so much about the unknown.The world No 1 can, by comparison with McIlroy, go about his business in relative anonymity. Scottie Scheffler turned heads on Tuesday byopenly questioning the meaning of golf. This was deep stuff for a 29‑year‑old; what on earth will his mindset be at 40? It was difficult to square this contemplative Scheffler with the man gesticulating wildly towards his coach at the US Open or reduced to tears after heavy defeat in the last Ryder Cup. In short, it was hard to take seriously.Jon Rahm has won twice on links courses in Ireland, including at nearby Portstewart.Tyrrell Hatton’s strong US Open showingrenders the Englishman worthy of respect. Russell Henley feels the underdog with most to offer. Yet by the very nature of this major, Open predictions can be an utterly futile business.The Open has never held more appeal. About 1.2 million applications flooded in for 280,000 available tickets. The scale of this tournament has grown exponentially over the past decade. For all golf participation has leapt in the same period, the R&A’s true success has been in making the Open land so strongly in the minds of general sports fans. The demographic of Open attenders is visibly younger than ever before.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And England must not underestimate that feeling for the Swedes.It was a humiliating defeat for Peter Gerhardsson’s team but they are in a much better place now than three years ago. They have really impressed in this competition so far and they are on a 15-game unbeaten run that has lasted just over a year.Kelly backs England’s ‘positive clique’ of finishers to deliver against SwedenRead moreThere is a danger of England thinking: “Oh, we’ve beaten this lot in the last Euros.” As a coach I always worry about a wounded team and I think Sweden are that, and I can say this categorically: Swedish players are the most tactical players I’ve coached, the most studious players, the most team‑oriented players, and they leave their ego at the door. For those reasons, they’re a threat to every team, and they’re a big threat to England in this fantastic quarter-final in Zurich.When I look at my own analysis, and I look at individuals, if you take the top 150 players in the world, of the teams in this tournament, Sweden would rank as the seventh best, but they are much stronger as a sum of their parts, as a team. Before their last gameagainst Germany, they were ranked as fourth favourites to win the title, so this is a group that have “team” at the centre of everything they do. They’ll be highly tactical and organised out of possession.Their midfielder Kosovare Asllani has been exceptional and so has Filippa Angeldal. In Nathalie Björn they have a leader at the back who is competent in possession but also really good at running a defensive line. The midfielder Johanna Rytting Kaneryd has been playing well and was particularly impressive against Poland. So I think this is a tougher test for England than it would have been against Germany – not because I don’t rate Germany – I think they are wonderful going forward – but I think they’re so vulnerable defensively, whereas Sweden are stingy as hell in defence. Don’t think: “Oh, good, we’ve avoided Germany.” No, this is a game nobody would take lightly.View image in fullscreenHead coach Peter Gerhardsson (centre) will step down after this tournament but has Sweden well organised after eight years in charge.Photograph: Ludvig Thunman/Bildbryån/ShutterstockAs a coach, England are the better team and they are the favourites but they’re playing against a Sweden team with far greater organisation than England faced against Walesor the Netherlands, and the things that have hurt the holders, the physical pace and power of France, are threats that Sweden pose too in transitional moments.Since the last European Championship, Sweden have also brought through the right players and they’ve found another real player in Smilla Holmberg, the right-back. I think she’s got everything to go the whole way. It is Gerhardsson’s final tournament with the team but there’s a consistency in his setup. He’s worked with his strongest eight or nine players for a period of time so there’s a real understanding between them, he’s calm and consistent in his approach, and I think he will have learned a lot from those failures in 2022.Quick GuideEngland v Sweden: past three meetingsShowEngland 4-0 Sweden, 26 July 2022, Sheffield\"One of the best goals you will ever see,\" the former England defender Stephen Warnock said – and few disagreed. Alessia Russo’s audacious backheel nutmeg sealed England’s third in style, a goal of the tournament winner from the bench. The Euro 2022 semi-final against Sweden played out like a dream: Beth Mead opened the scoring, Lucy Bronze powered in a header, and Fran Kirby’s clever lob capped it off. Four goals, four statements. The Lionesses were ruthless. Sweden simply had no reply.England 1-1 Sweden, 5 April 2024, LondonSweden looked nothing like the side torn apart at Euro 2022. In a closely contested qualifier, they held firm against an England team dominant in possession but short on chances. Alessia Russo, once again in imperious form, broke through with a striker’s dream – a one-on-one calmly slotted home. Both sides grew bolder as the game wore on. A moment’s lapse from the Lionesses and Sweden’s rising star Rosa Kafaji Roflo punished them with an electric equaliser – well-earned.Sweden 0-0 England, 16 July 2024, GothenburgIt may have ended goalless but England got what they came for. A draw in Gothenburg sealed their place at Euro 2025. \"Keeping it to 0-0, qualifying from a very hard group – I'm very relieved,\" the head coach, Sarina Wiegman, said. The Lionesses impressed early but faded, relying on the goalkeeper Hannah Hampton to keep their clean sheet. Georgia Stanway came closest to scoring with a strike from distance. Sweden, backed by a lively home crowd, failed to capitalise on the buzz.Nasra AbdiWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.He’s not a big risk-taker. I could very much see Sweden set up in an organised block but it’ll be interesting to see how low they sit. Will they really just absorb pressure and allow England to have the ball? On Saturday, Sweden beat the Germany press and got up against a backline which wasn’t the quickest. It is similar with England. Sarina Wiegman’s side will be very aggressive with lots of players up high, very aggressive in the counterpress, and if Sweden solve this situation like France did, then I think you’re going to see similarly tough moments for England to defend.But it will be interesting to see what Sweden have learned because they play in a really compact 4-4-2 and if you don’t get those distances right England will pick you off in the pockets. Especially Lauren James. When she is in the mood she was inagainst Wales, and she’s in “that place”, she’s enjoying her football, we all know she’s one of the best players in the world. She’s been brilliant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She’s beenhugely impactful for the team. She is exploiting the spaces between the full-backs and the centre-backs, and those runs from deep are really helping England. I think she’s playing with the bit between her teeth. She’s got a bit of a chip in her performance, and I like that side of Ella Toone. She seems more mature, focused and like someone who obviously has a natural telepathy with Alessia Russo. You can see how much they care for each other as friends, but also how they know each other’s game inside out. That’s really helpful because maybe Russo is taking up so much attention from defenders and giving a bit more space for Ella.At the opposite end of the pitch, England have to be wary of Stina Blackstenius. She was a nightmare to play against. In fact, when I was the Chelsea manager, we were always grateful when she wasn’t in the starting lineup for Arsenal. She makes it that much harder for you as a team to be so high up the pitch, because of her channel runs. She’s also improved in the little movements, to stay onside.I always thought she was a player that drifted offside a lot but I think she’s brought a lot of what we call double movements into her game – ie, lots of running across a line onside – and she’s got better at holding those runs to stay onside. And she’s been clinical. I think she’s at her best level yet. I always rated her decisiveness and being clinical – she’s got everything in her locker. She’s good if you’ve got balls coming into the box, she’s good at running in behind and she now looks a more complete player.Whoever wins this quarter-final will be the favourites for their semi‑final and should be expected to make the final, but football isn’t that straightforward. What is important to say is that the quality of the quarter-finalists compared with Euro 2022 is so much higher. Italy’s performance against Spain in the group stage showed that finally years of work on their domestic league is bearing fruit. And France, phwoar, it’ll take a lot to beat France. I can’t wait to watch them against Germany and the other match-ups.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamSweden women's football teamWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

From the higher floors of the 385-metre PIF Tower, employees can plot their next deal while gazing down on a glass-curtained canopy of concrete, steel and polished marble.For Yasir al-Rumayyan, the governor of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) and the chair ofNewcastle United, the top of this striking, 80-storey crystalline structure is a place where metaphorical blue-sky thinking meets reality.Liverpool make approach to sign Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo EkitikeRead moreThe bad news for Eddie Howe is that the business case for selling Alexander Isak toLiverpoolthis summer is surely far too persuasive for Rumayyan and his colleagues to ignore.In an ideal world Newcastle’s manager would keep the Sweden centre-forward while acquiring the France Under-21 striker Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt before a Champions League campaign. Given that Liverpool, like Newcastle, have madecontact with Eintracht over Ekitikeand seem determined to acquire the Frenchman or Isak that scenario seems unlikely.The message from Newcastle – and it is said to originate “right from the very top” in Riyadh – has consistently been that Isak will not be sold this year. Indeed, the word is that Howe wants to deviate from his preferred, winger-heavy 4-3-3 and play Isak and Ekitike in attacking tandem.But, even before contemplating the reality that insisting something or someone is not for sale at any price is frequently a precursor to driving a hard bargain, that supposed stance begs quite a few questions.View image in fullscreenHugo Ekitike, who scored 22 goals last season for Eintracht Frankfurt, has already been a target twice for Eddie Howe at Newcastle.Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA-EFEFirst and foremost why, shortly after Howe and club officials met Isak’s agent, did Newcastle suddenly turn their attention from potential £30m replacements for Isak’s former understudy Callum Wilson to more expensive targets and end up offeringEintracht Frankfurtapproaching £70m for Ekitike? Was it really pure coincidence?And why has there not been any announcement of Isak entering long-mooted summer negotiations to extend a contract that runs until 2028? Even if a player who scored 23 goals in 34 Premier League appearances last season declined to sign, a deal could surely be discussed.Although Isak is extremely well paid at about £150,000 a week, talks regarding a planned pay increase last summer were postponed as Newcastle struggled to stay on the right side of Premier League spending rules. Much improved terms seem his for the taking now but maybe that moment has passed and Isak would rather move to pastures new.Newcastle have long suspected that he would decline an extension this summer, and their original plan was to keep him for one more season and sell high in 12 months. But Ekitike’s wages would almost certainly be slightly cheaper and, having just turned 23, he is almost three years younger than Isak. Throw in some stylistic similarities in the pair’s games – for a start both like to drift to the left and suit counterattacking tactics – and the fact that Ekitike is less injury prone and the case for doing a deal with Liverpool becomes ever more persuasive.Then there’s Howe’s relationship with Richard Hughes. Newcastle’s manager and Liverpool’s sporting director are good friends, stemming from their days together at Bournemouth. Although Liverpool deny making a formal approach for Isak, the fact that intermediaries have subtly made clear that Arne Slot’s board would be prepared to pay about £120m for Howe’s prize possession suggests they have received encouragement, however tacit, from someone, somewhere.View image in fullscreenEddie Howe (left) welcomes new signing Anthony Elanga to Newcastle, but how many other players will the club manage to sign this summer?Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty ImagesWithPaul Mitchell having stepped down as Newcastle’s sporting directorthis summer and Darren Eales, the chief executive, due to depart on health grounds, Andy Howe, the manager’s nephew, has a key role in recruitment.

Considering Howe needs a right-sided central defender and a goalkeeper – negotiations with Burnley are inching towards a £30m-plus deal for James Trafford – in addition to replacing the Leeds-bound Sean Longstaff in midfield, something is going to have to give.Accordingly if Newcastle can sell Isak for almost double the near-£65m they paid Real Sociedad for him it would reflect extremely well on their PSR balance sheet. The attendant financial wriggle room would help fund the purchase of a central striker as cover for Ekitike or whoever joins as the first choice, and maybe even a move for Coventry’s Jack Rudoni, an attacking midfielder much coveted by Howe.It all leaves the ball firmly in Eintracht’s court. The German club are noted as tough negotiators and hope for more than Ekitike’s £87m release clause. Bundesliga strikers have not always fared overly well in the Premier League but the Frenchman scored 22 goals last season, including 15 in the league to help Eintracht qualify for the Champions League. In 2022 he was Newcastle’s top attacking target, ahead of even Isak. Howe has twice tried, and failed, to buy him.Liverpool possess the pulling power and financial clout to tempt Ekitike to play for Slot rather than Howe but is Isak the striker Slot really wants?One thing is clear. If Newcastle cannot sign Ekitike the stack of cards collapses and it becomes impossible to imagine anyone in PIF Tower approving Isak’s sale.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedLiverpoolEintracht FrankfurtTransfer windowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, the team absolutely condemns any protests or actions of individuals that interfere with racing at the Tour de France or threaten the safety of the entire peloton.”The team have been surrounded by a significant armed police presence since the race started in Lille on 5 July. “The security measures afforded to the team during the Tour de France are the directive of [the race organiser] ASO and relevant French police departments,” the statement read. “The team cooperates fully with the security protocols outlined by the race and appreciates the significant efforts made by all parties to ensure team members’ safety at the race.”Pogacar’s crash came with 6km to race after he touched the rear wheel of Abrahamsen’s teammate Tobias Johannessen and crashed on his left side, before sliding into the kerb. “I’m a bit beaten up, but we’ve been through worse days,” Pogacar said after the finish.Of the circumstances surrounding his fall, he said: “I think everybody was a bità bloc. There were attacks from Matteo [Jorgenson] and Jonas Vingegaard, they really put everybody on the limit. Unfortunately one rider decided to follow from left to right side of the road. He didn’t see me and he just completely cut me off, my front wheel.View image in fullscreenTadej Pogacar (centre) competes on stage 11 of the Tour de France.Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty Images“Luckily, I just have a little bit of skin off. I was scared when I saw the sidewalk that I was going [to hit] my head directly to the sidewalk, but luckily my skin is tough and stopped me before the sidewalk.”The defending champion was quickly back on his feet but, after struggling to rethread his dropped chain, was in danger of losing time in the overall standings.However, the group of main favourites he had been riding with, including the race leader, Ben Healy, and key rivals Remco Evenepoel and Vingegaard, slowed their pace in the closing kilometres and waited for the Slovenian to rejoin.“Thanks to the peloton in front,” Pogacar said. “They actually waited. Obviously the race was more or less over back there, but still, they could take time – maybe not take too much time – but I would need to go really deep to come back like this. Really big respect to everybody in front.”Pogacar finished the stage with blood on his left arm, and scuffing on his hip and shoulder. He has already lost a key teammate, João Almeida, who was forced to abandon the Tour after crashing on the stage to Mûr-de-Bretagne.“Tomorrow is a big day,” the defending champion said of the first high-altitude finish at Hautacam in the Hautes-Pyrénées on Thursday. “We’ll see how I recover. Normally the day after a crash you’re never at the best, but I will give my best and we’ll see. I think we’re ready as a team for Hautacam.”Pogacar’s Emirates XRG team manager, Mauro Gianetti, who also described his rider as “angry”, said: “A crash makes you worry because you never know. It could be an easy crash, or a big crash. Fortunately that one, even though it was quite high speed, was not that damaging for Tadej himself.”There is little doubt, however, that Vingegaard’s Visma-Lease a bike team will be buoyed by the troubles befalling the champion. In the aftermath of the loss of Almeida, the last thing Pogacar needs is to be handicapped on a daunting climb on which his Danish rival sealed Tour victory over him in 2022.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarTour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

He is asked for his favourite Lions memory and his response is illuminating. “Ugo Monye scoring his tryin the third Test[against South Africa in 2009]. When you’re young and growing up, you look at players that look like you. And, by that, I don’t mean eyes, ears, nose, I mean who have the same skin colour, who you can identify with. Ugo is one I could identify with, as we’re both of Nigerian descent. To see him score that amazing try resonated with me.”On Saturday, when the Lions begin their series against Australia, Itoje will win his 100th Test cap. He is England captain, the first black captain of the Lions and the country’s most prominent rugby player. And you cannot help but wonder to what extent he himself has passed the torch. For there can be little doubt that the number of British-Nigerian players making a significant impact in the Premiership is at an all-time high. Gabriel Ibitoye finished the season as joint top try-scorer, Immanuel Feyi-Waboso began it as England’s next big thing. Andy Onyeama-Christie, Beno Obano, Nick Isiekwe, Max Ojomoh, Afo Fasogbon and Emeka Ilione all shone across the campaign.Andy Farrell knows what it takes to play for the Lions against AustraliaRead moreThe list goes on. Indeed it is five years since Itoje picked his Nigerian British XV on social media, with Monye as director of rugby and his aunt, Funke, as team manager. These things are subjective but by most metrics, today’s team would be considerably stronger and many of its contingent would have been inspired by Itoje’s totemic performance for theLions against New Zealand in 2017, just as he was by Monye’s try.“There’s only a small number of us who have contributed to the Premiership,” says Monye, who recalls being approached by Itoje’s father, Efe, to offer his gratitude at paving the way for his son. “We’re punching way above our weight, it’s totally disproportionate but of course you feel a greater sense of pride when it is one of your own and someone who has a similar heritage.”Itoje, 30, is passionately proud of his Nigerian heritage. He co-founded theAkoje Galleryto showcase African art and established his charity thePearl Fundwhich seeks to tackle poverty among children in Nigeria and other African countries. And after England’s2019 World Cup final defeat by South Africahe quoted a Nigerian proverb: “When a ram goes backwards, it is not retreating. It moves back to gather more strength.”View image in fullscreenMaro Itoje in typical action in the middle of a driving maul against Queensland Reds in Brisbane.Photograph: David Gibson/Fotosport/ShutterstockWithin the rugby-playing, British-Nigerian community he is idolised while the president of Rugby Africa, Herbert Mensah, sees parallels between Itoje and Siya Kolisi, the Springboks captain. “What does Maro mean to Africa? In many ways, in the same way that Siya Kolisi symbolises something with a similar kind of temperament, that he has now become a global brand,” says Mensah. “Maro has also risen to being that brand, in Africa he still represents that leader. He’s not confused as to his heritage and in many ways he is the typical, educated African son. He is someone that every parent craves for.”Stallions RFC is a sevens-playing London-based team made up predominantly of players with Nigerian heritage. It is a successor to London Nigerian and was founded in 2009, initially as Nigeria Exiles. Suvwe Obano – brother of Beno and cousin of Itoje – and Matt Ilube, son of the former Rugby Football Union chairman Tom, are among those who have turned out in recent years.View image in fullscreenMaro Itoje is flanked by his brother Jeremy, mother Florence, father Efe and sister Isabel at a fundraiser dinner for his charity foundation the Pearl Fund.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images for The Pearl Fund“Within those who are in British-Nigerian rugby, Maro is definitely a role model,” says Ade Ojigbo, who joined Stallions in 2022. “When [Maro] got announced as Lions captain someone on the group chat said: ‘Oh, does that mean he won’t be available for us next week?’ I look at the example of my mum and dad, they’re not the biggest rugby fans, I don’t know if they’d be able to name him. For those of us within rugby, within sport, it is that idea of you’ve got someone who is like you, similar to you. To the extent that goes wider? Obviously it will have an impact, the fact that a British-Nigerian is captain of a major sporting international team and now the Lions, it probably will have reach, but I think there is still a job to do.”View image in fullscreenImmanuel Feyi-Waboso dives over to score a try during the Autumn Nations Series match against the All Blacks at Twickenham last year.Photograph: Ian Walton/APThere is a well-established path from Stallions to the Nigeria XVs and sevens teams to the extent that they sent 11 players for the pre-Olympic qualifiers and the Olympic qualifiers. This year eight players represented Nigeria in the Africa Sevens. “We are very much a pathway for the Nigerian national team but it’s actually a bit bigger than that because there’s a cultural and community aspect to it as well,” adds Ojigbo“A lot of boys who are British-Nigerian, they love rugby, they love playing it but they can feel that as if rugby isn’t for them or there’s no space for them in rugby or they don’t feel seen, they still feel on the outside of that. It’s creating that space where rugby can be the sport that is open as people try and see and no matter who you are you can find a space where you can flourish in that.”To revert to Itoje’s Lions memories, it is telling that the 2005 tour of New Zealand did not register with him. Hardly surprising perhaps, given the disaster it was, but as he has pointed out, he did not start watching rugby until 2007 when he was 13 and a pupil at St George’s School in Harpenden at the same time as Owen Farrell, who was three years above him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Efe did not speak to him for three days. “I totally can relate to that and I think every lad who has Nigerian heritage and a similar upbringing would have a similar story to that,” adds Monye.“The number one reason why you see so many British-Nigerians play rugby is because of the education system. Education in Nigeria is number one so if you can find an opportunity to have your son or daughter attend private school you absolutely will. And just as a direct consequence of that, you’re likely to then pick up a rugby ball.“I think we’re a genetically gifted nation. I don’t think people are being sent to school to become these legendary rugby players, they are sent there to get great educations and actually if you asked most Nigerian mums and dads, it’s education first and that’s it.”View image in fullscreenMaro Itoje in Brisbane. He will lead out the Lions there in Saturday’s opening Test against AustraliaPhotograph: Brendan Moran/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesAccording to the most recent data, the Nigerian population in the UK is 270,000 but significantly bigger when factoring in those born here. But only somewhere between 6-7% of the population in the UK attends private school, so the scope for untapped potential becomes clearer. Monye illustrates the point perfectly when recalling his playing career.“When Steve Borthwick announces his side he says: ‘This is the best 23 players in England.’ I always think, is it? We don’t know. We have a pathway within the private school system, it is superb. What about the rest? Imagine if we could tap into that. When I played on the world sevens series, I was considered one of the quickest on the scene, one of the quickest in the Premiership, and in the international game. At my state school I wasn’t even the fastest in my class.“Of course, you need more than just pace or natural ability but genetics matter, in contact sport it bloody matters and I believe there are a lot of lads out there who have the core ingredients, who could be moulded into something special. But we would never know.”Explore more on these topicsLions tour 2025Maro ItojeBritish & Irish LionsRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I saw in the eyes of my teammates something I can’t explain in words. We knew it was difficult to reach the semi-final but we all knew we could do it.“It’s something magical. Tonight being among the four best teams is a great satisfaction. We are doing this for our glory but the meaning is much deeper and we want to bring this meaning to Italy. In Italy we can play football and also women and girls can play football.”For both teams this tie represented a priceless opportunity to reach a semi-final, after a relatively kind draw. They had both been eliminated at the group stage of the European Championship in 2017 and 2022. They had both given their supporters cause for optimism during their group matches and knew the heavyweight contenders were all in action later this week in the other last-eight fixtures. Perhaps, with that, came a few nerves.View image in fullscreenAda Hegerberg stares at the floor at full time after Norway’s defeat.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersNorway supporters were certainly in the minority as Italy fans flocked to Geneva and Norway also created the minority of the first-half chances, as the Italians showed the greater attacking endeavour in a cautious first 45 minutes. A tournament-record average of 3.7 goals per game had been scored in the group stages, as attacking football became the norm. But perhaps it was to be expected that the start of the knockout rounds would deliver a goalless first 45 minutes, an element of caginess creeping into both sides.Despite the slow tempo, Italy played some neat football, going close through Manuela Giugliano, Girelli’s attempted header and Lucia Di Guglielmo, while their energetic midfielder Emma Severini burst into the penalty area but saw her shot well saved by the Norway goalkeeper Cecilie Fiskerstrand.The Italians broke the deadlock when Sofia Cantore’s goalbound shot from the right side of the box was angled into the net with the gentlest of touches from Girelli. Italy had the momentum suddenly and Cantore thought she had doubled the lead moments later but her scrambled effort was disallowed for offside. Soon the game was seesawing as Norway were awarded a penalty when Hegerberg was bundled down by Elena Linari.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They also claimed the silver medal at the Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo Olympics. In Europe, their success is even more consistent and they stand one win from a 10th European semi-final when they meet England in Zurich on Thursday. Their men’s national side has not reached a world or European semi-final for more than 30 years.All Euro 2025 players under pressure to ‘explode’ women’s game, insists BronzeRead moreThis unrelenting strength in women’s football stems from way before even their triumph in the inaugural Women’s European Championship in 1984; it goes back to the 1960s, at a time when the women’s gamewas banned in England.Jonny Hjelm, a professor in the department of historical, philosophical and religious studies at Umeå university, has co-authored papers on women’s football including A Breakthrough: Women’s Football in Sweden, which assessed its development between 1965 and 1980. He says: “In 1968, the local football authorities in western Sweden accepted football for women and had pioneers who could start a league. This league developed icons.“Denmark was actually a couple of years ahead of Sweden in the development of serious women’s football in the 1960s – they had a league in the beginning of the 60s which we in Sweden did not have. But you’ll find the same pattern in Norway, Denmark and Sweden when you talk about women’s football. On a very general level, there is a correlation between women’s position in society and their performance in sports arena, and women’s rights were very different here compared to some other countries.“In [some countries] football was very strongly connected to masculinity. You’ll find that in the Nordic countries too, but not to the same degree. When Umeå won the European title [in 2004] with players like the Brazilian Marta, players could train two times a day, the Damallsvenskan had the best international players and the young girls in Umeå had idols just around the corner.”View image in fullscreenSweden’s Hanna Lundkvist practises her headers during training.Photograph: Ludvig Thunman/Bildbyrån/ShutterstockHjelm is not alone in thinking the country’s relatively liberal views have played a part. Linus Gunnarsson, a Fifa-licensed agent from Linus MGMT and a lawyer at the MAQS law firm, based in Sweden, has been working in the women’s game since 2019 and says: “It’s a country where I think the attitude towards gender equality has always been very progressive, so there’s always been a culture to promote women’s football. Also in Sweden, the youth development system is at the forefront, and then also the Swedish FA has been relatively good, historically, in promoting women’s football as well.”But how does that translate to consistently reaching the latter stages of tournaments? Mia Eriksson, the sporting director at the Damallsvenskan club Linköping, praises the league’s attitudes towards enforcing top-level coaching: “To coach in the Damallsvenskan, you need a Uefa Pro licence, the highest licence to coach, and that’s not the case in the WSL for example. That says a lot about the Swedish model. We have high demands.“You can’t just come and coach here, you have to meet high standards here. We are very tactical and our gameplans require a high level of tactical knowledge from the players. Now you see [at Euro 2025] the Swedish players are really good at winning the ball high up the pitch.“The ‘team’ is also key to team sports in Sweden. Other teams have great stars who can win a game on their own, but if they don’t perform, the whole team can collapse, whereas Sweden also has big stars but they can do everything as a team. That’s the culture in Sweden. We are raised that way: it’s all about the team machine. And our league has been one of the greatest leagues for many, many years, creating so many senior players across the Euros.”View image in fullscreenRolfö, Linda Sembrant and Kosovare Asllani lead the team in applauding the fans after the victory against Germany.Photograph: Ludvig Thunman/Bildbyrån/ShutterstockGunnarsson’s first clients in the women’s game were the Sweden forwards Anna Anvegård and Stina Blackstenius, the Arsenal striker who scored the winning goal inlast season’s Women’s Champions League final. “Women’s football gets a lot of media coverage here and [the public] is closely connected to women’s football,” he says. “And the [national team] is an insanely good group of world-class football players in every position, as well as a strong team. So we expect them to be up there.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But even though the national team are thriving, are the best players eventually going to abandon the Swedish domestic league?“The Damallsvenskan is still one of the best leagues,” Gunnarsson says. “Of course it’s not always going to be, with the big countries investing more and more, but this is how it should be. Sweden shouldn’t have the best league in the world – that wouldn’t make sense. But I still think it’s one of the best and right now, it’s probably stronger than ever, because we have clubs like Malmö, Häcken, Hammarby, huge clubs on the men’s side that are also making huge investments on the women’s side.Quick GuideEngland v Sweden: past three meetingsShowEngland 4-0 Sweden, 26 July 2022, Sheffield\"One of the best goals you will ever see,\" the former England defender Stephen Warnock said – and few disagreed. Alessia Russo’s audacious backheel nutmeg sealed England’s third in style, a goal of the tournament winner from the bench. The Euro 2022 semi-final against Sweden played out like a dream: Beth Mead opened the scoring, Lucy Bronze powered in a header, and Fran Kirby’s clever lob capped it off. Four goals, four statements. The Lionesses were ruthless. Sweden simply had no reply.England 1-1 Sweden, 5 April 2024, LondonSweden looked nothing like the side torn apart at Euro 2022. In a closely contested qualifier, they held firm against an England team dominant in possession but short on chances. Alessia Russo, once again in imperious form, broke through with a striker’s dream – a one-on-one calmly slotted home. Both sides grew bolder as the game wore on. A moment’s lapse from the Lionesses and Sweden’s rising star Rosa Kafaji Roflo punished them with an electric equaliser – well-earned.Sweden 0-0 England, 16 July 2024, GothenburgIt may have ended goalless but England got what they came for. A draw in Gothenburg sealed their place at Euro 2025. \"Keeping it to 0-0, qualifying from a very hard group – I'm very relieved,\" the head coach, Sarina Wiegman, said. The Lionesses impressed early but faded, relying on the goalkeeper Hannah Hampton to keep their clean sheet. Georgia Stanway came closest to scoring with a strike from distance. Sweden, backed by a lively home crowd, failed to capitalise on the buzz.Nasra AbdiWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Of course there is bigger money in other countries but, when it comes to how the clubs are being run, we are really far ahead, because a lot of the clubs here have a really good environment to play in.”The Swedish club model applies a 51% rule safeguarding fan control, which has meant Europe’s giants have stormed past Swedish clubs in the past 15 years financially. Eriksson, who has also worked in the media and in football analysis and scouting in Sweden, says she is not worried about the Damallsvenskan’s future, though: “We can’t sell clubs out to be owned by oil companies so, no, we won’t be able to keep up, but that doesn’t mean we can’t still be in a great place.“What I do think is that Swedish women’s football, from now on, needs very clear strategies on how we are going to work to bring in the money and get everything spinning still. But we will still be able to do what the Swedish women’s national team are showing right now, which is that we can be really good at what we are good at.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Sweden women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Every other team wants to replicate what England did in 2022, what the Netherlands did before us, and really boost women’s football and we know that success comes from that.Williamson ready to put Arsenal friendship aside for Blackstenius and Sweden testRead more“We know that we’re very fortunate in England that when we have success it really does explode the game and I think it’s what we want all over Europe and all over the world.”The meteoric growth of women’s football in England afterthe Lionesses’ success at Euro 2022is a bonus, though not their “why” as a team. “My main reason for winning the tournament is to lift the trophy,” Bronze said. “But a part and parcel of success is that it helps build the women’s game and that’s something that obviously I want to happen in England more and more.”Bronze is competing at her seventh major tournament with England. Kosovare Asllani, who joined Sweden’s coach, Peter Gerhardsson, in facing the media, is competing in her eighth. “It’s a bit like the fun starts now,” the midfielder said. “It’s always a tough game. England have a lot of talented players whereas our biggest strength lies in the way we play as a team.”Bronze said: “Someone mentioned that Asllani said it’s going to be fun. My interpretation of that is that this is two teams that are in this game to win it, no sitting back, both very talented, athletic, physical and everything that you think of in a football game could happen because both teams are at the top level.”The teamsare very familiar with each other. Many of Sweden’s squad play in the Women’s Super League and the countries met in the 2019 World Cup bronze medal match, with Sweden the victors, in the Euro 2022 quarter-finals, with England winning, and shared the spoils in the Nations League last season, with two draws.View image in fullscreenKosovare Asllani trains alongside her Sweden teammates ahead of the meeting with England.Photograph: Ludvig Thunman/Bildbyrån/Shutterstock“We respect England, the team they have and everything they have achieved so far,” Asllani said. “Do we fear them? No. We don’t have the word fear in our dictionary. We look up the word courage. Of course, you have to respect one of the best sides in the world and we have the perfect gameplan for this match. I feel a sense of longing to start the game. We want to go out and play our football intensely and physically. In our minds there is only one outcome and that is to win.”The key to success for England is focusing on themselves on and off the pitch. “Coming off the back of the France game and having a lot of talking points actually brought the team closer together,” Bronze said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re not focused too much on noises around other teams or ourselves. We’re only focused on what we do on the training pitch, what we do in games, how we recover, how we perform and how we lift each other up.”Bronze also went deeper on whatthe mantra of being “proper England”means. “We have a lot of younger players and new players who have very different experiences of playing for England compared to the likes of myself, who know that England used to have to dig deep all the time,” she said. “The 2015 World Cup was the first time we beat Germany – that’s insane to think about now – but England in the past had to dig out performances and was the underdog, not the favourite.“This England team has developed from there, football has changed. Obviously we’re a very talented team, with a lot of technical and tactical ability, but we don’t want to ever forget that we are England, we are ‘proper England’, and if push comes to shove we can win a game in any means possible.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Lucy BronzeEngland women's football teamSweden women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

He was 49.Grønvold won bronze at the 2010 Vancouver Games.“It is with great sadness that we have received the news of Audun Grønvold’s untimely passing,” the federation said. “The former national alpine skier and ski cross athlete was recently struck by lightning during a cabin trip.”The federation said Grønvold was “quickly taken to hospital and received treatment for the injuries he sustained in the lightning strike” but died on Tuesday night.Grønvold was a member of Norway’s alpine skiing team before he moved into freestyle and ski cross. He had one podium finish as a World Cup alpine skier, finishing third in a downhill in Sierra Nevada, Spain, in 1999.He also won a bronze medal in ski cross at the 2005 world championships, and the overall ski cross cup in 2007. After his career ended, he became a national-team coach and a TV commentator.“Norwegian skiing has lost a prominent figure, who has meant so much to both the Alpine and freestyle communities,” the federation president, Tove Moe Dyrhaug, said, adding that his death created “a huge void”.Grønvold his survived by his wife and three children. His wife, Kristin Tandberg Haugsjå, said in a Facebook post that her husband was “my great love and my best friend for 20 years”. She added the accident had happened while they were on their summer vacation.Explore more on these topicsSkiingWinter OlympicsNorwayEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The day she was announced as the new England head coach, she declared that the national side had “underperformed” in the one‑day format of late, and that she was making it her “first priority” before the World Cup in India in October.All eyes, then, on this three‑match ODI series against India, which began on Wednesday at Southampton with a narrow four-wicket win by the visitors.Ecclestone guides England to consolation win in final-ball thriller against IndiaRead moreAfter England’s sloppiness in the T20 series defeat, India returned the favour here, putting down catches off the two players – Sophia Dunkley and Alice Davidson-Richards – who crafted England’s recovery from 97 for four to 258 for six.India then did their level best to mess up what should have been a relatively straightforward run chase: the lowlight was a horrendously casual piece of running by Harleen Deol which led to her dismissal purely because she couldn’t be bothered to ground her bat.The opener Pratika Rawal struck a neat 36 but was bowled going back to Sophie Ecclestone’s arm ball and was visibly frustrated, shoulder-barging Ecclestone on the way off the pitch – evoking a whiff of the tensions which have beset the men’s teams of late.A 90-run partnership between Deepti Sharma and Jemimah Rodrigues initially looked like it would see India home, but Rodrigues ditched the sensible approach with 45 runs still needed, caught behind attempting a ramp to Lauren Filer.Still, Deepti said she felt no nerves in the chase. “I was confident that if I was there I would finish it,” she said, after an unbeaten 62. She also praised the back-to-back boundaries from Amanjot Kaur which eventually enabled India to win with 10 balls to spare. “We played as a team,” Deepti said.View image in fullscreenSophia Dunkley does her best to build a defendable score for England.Photograph: Dave Vokes/ShutterstockEarlier, England had wobbled perilously after choosing to bat first: Tammy Beaumont and Amy Jones – who shared consecutive double-century partnerships earlier in the summer against West Indies – fell within the opening four overs, and the usually solid Nat Sciver‑Brunt met with relative failure in her first innings back after a groin injury, falling to a sprawling catch by Rodrigues at short midwicket for 41.But England found a measure of salvation in the unlikely shape of Dunkley and Davidson-Richards, who shared a 106-run stand for the fifth wicket across 23 overs. Under Jon Lewis, Dunkley failed to find a settled role in the ODI side (batting anywhere from No 1 to No 5), while Davidson-Richards failed to find any role at all – this being her first ODI since September 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re trying to see the real value of having set batters in at the end, and taking those partnerships as deep as possible.”Acceleration came in the last nine overs: Davidson-Richards dashed down the track and was stumped; then Dunkley proceeded to score 33 more runs off 22 balls, bowled swinging off the final ball of the innings.Edwards watched from the same balcony, at the same ground, from where she commanded Southern Vipers to five domestic titles, assessing whether this is the XI who might win her similar glory on the international stage.

Brentford also privately indicated a medical was expected imminently.Ethan Nwaneri poised to sign new Arsenal deal amid Chelsea and Bundesliga interestRead moreThe change of stance has been met with resistance by Ratcliffe and Wilcox, who do not wish to be held to ransom and are determined to be patient. Brentford view their position as firm because although Mbeumo’s contract expires next summer the club hold a one-year option.If Ratcliffe, who oversees football operations at United, and Wilcox decide to raise their offer they may first want money from the sale or loan of one of Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.

A series of late approaches from Brentford are understood to have been firmed up with an offer shortly before the deadline, but that failed to meet the requirements.The bid was spread in instalments, with Ipswich instead requiring cash up front. The expiry of the clause gives Ipswich greater control of the 21-year-old’s destiny but their resolve could still be tested if Brentford return with a more palatable payment structure.Brentford are undergoing a summer revamp under Keith Andrews and are keen on signing Hutchinson, who shone for England in theirvictorious Uefa Under-21 Championship campaign.Elsewhere, Bournemouth have completed the £25m signing of the goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic from Chelsea on a five-year deal.

It was revealed last month thatForest had written to Uefa to raise concernsthat Palace could be in breach of regulations that bar clubs with the same owner from competing in the same competition if an individual or ownership group is considered to have a decisive influence over more than one of those teams.‘It’s not fair’: Crystal Palace fans march in protest at demotion from Europa LeagueRead moreUefa deemed that a move by Palace’s biggest shareholder, John Textor, whose company Eagle Football Holdings also owns Lyon – who have also qualified for the Europa League – tosell his stake to the New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson, had come too late despite completion of the deal now being imminent. The Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, who also owns the Greek champions Olympiakos, placed his shares into a blind trust to comply with the rules in the event that Forest qualified for the Champions League. Uefa rejected Textor’s attempts to do the same after he missed the 1 March deadline.Parish, asked by Gary Lineker on The Rest is Football podcast whether Forest had played a part in Palace being demoted, said: “Yes. We were told that and I think it’s been made public. These things seem to be played out in public. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of confidentiality that comes out of certain organisations. But we’re led to believe that that’s the issue – if there wasn’t somebody that wanted to get in as a consequence, then there wouldn’t be a problem.“People have got to look at themselves. Some people will say it’s fine, some people will say it’s not. I don’t really have control of that. I only have control of the arguments that we put forward toUefa.”Forest declined to comment. Parish said he was “very hopeful” of winning the appeal at Cas, which he expects to take place before the end of the month.View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace earned a place in next season’s Europa League by winning the FA Cup for the first time last season.Photograph: Nick Potts/PA“We get the written ruling from last week’s decision with all the details from Uefa and then, apparently, the appeal is 10 days,” he said.“I think [the Uefa president] Mr Ceferin could resolve this situation, and it would be a very good look if he did, because I think most people think it is right that we are in the competition. The draw for the Conference League is 4 August, so this needs to be wrapped up by the end of July.”Meanwhile, a group of Liberal Democrat MPs from south London has written to the culture secretary urging her to intervene over Palace’s demotion, as the club’s most influential supporters’ group plans to take its protest to Uefa’s headquarters in Switzerland. Hundreds of supportersmarched to Selhurst Parkon Tuesday night to voice anger at Uefa’s decision.A letter was sent to Lisa Nandy on Wednesday by seven Lib Dem MPs including Bobby Dean, whose Carshalton and Wallington constituency contains many Palace supporters, and the leader, Sir Ed Davey, expressing deep concern over Palace’s “disgraceful treatment”. It requested that the secretary of state for culture, media and sport ensure “the decision-making process is reviewed for transparency and fairness” and “the club is given a fair opportunity to appeal or respond to any allegations”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We hope you will take this matter seriously and act to uphold the principles of fairness, accountability, and integrity in sport.”Dean told the Guardian: “This is heartbreaking for fans. In what should be an unblemished year of celebration for the club, officials totally disconnected from the side’s success on the pitch have issued a highly unusual and severe punishment that raises serious questions about fairness in the governance of English football. We are urging the government to back our appeal to Uefa for a thorough review of this decision. Fans must be at the centre of the game, not treated as an afterthought.”Quick GuideGoalkeeper Hennessey retires at age of 38ShowWayne Hennessey, the most-capped goalkeeper in Wales history, has retired at the age of 38 after representing his country in 109 matches. Hennessey made more than 100 league appearances each for Wolves and Crystal Palace, reaching the FA Cup final in 2016 with the latter. He was at Nottingham Forest last season but did not make an appearance.The Bangor-born player was part of the Wales squad that reached the semi-finals of the Euros in 2016 and appeared at the 2022 World Cup. He last played for Wales in November 2023 in a friendly against Gibraltar. \"I have decided to bring my playing career to an end, I look back with gratitude and forward with optimism as I take the next steps on my footballing journey,\" Hennessey said.ReutersPhotograph: David Davies/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The march on Tuesday was led by the Holmesdale Fanatics, who took aim at Uefa with a banner that described it as “morally bankrupt”. The Fanatics have promised to organise another protest at Uefa’s headquarters in Nyon in the coming days.“We want to go there and put enough pressure on them and make it enough of a public issue that we can affect the decision,” said Fanatics member Mickey Grafton. “In short, the next step is to go to Switzerland.

That’s why we are taking action to close loopholes and strengthen donation rules, so the public can have confidence in the electoral process.”Under the plans, political parties will be required to assess companies they are receiving donations from against a series of tests, proving their connection to the UK or Ireland. Companies used for political donations will have to prove they are generating income in these countries.Currently, any UK company can make donations to a political party, regardless of when it was set up, where its money comes from and who its owners are.There will also be enhanced “know your donor” checks, meaning parties will have to consider the risk of any money coming from illegitimate sources. New guidance will be provided by theElectoral Commissionon conducting these risk assessments.The committee on standards in public life and the Electoral Commission have previously called for strengthened regulations and greater transparency in political donations.However, the new rules are expected to stop short of imposing caps on political donations.Some campaigners had called for more sweeping reforms after the US billionaire Elon Muskfloated the idea of giving $100m to Reform UK– an idea he now appears to have dropped after tensions with the party’s leader, Nigel Farage.He would not, as a foreign national, be able to donate and under the new rules and would have to prove any donation through a UK-based company had UK-generated revenue.The overhaul is also likely to stop short of a ban on donations in cryptocurrency, despite Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister and close ally of the prime minister, Keir Starmer, telling MPs on Monday he thought there was a case for doing so given how hard it was to trace their source.His comments come two months after Farage announced Reform would become the first party in British politics toaccept donations in bitcoin, mirroring a similar move by Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential election.The campaign group Spotlight on Corruption has warned the practicecould allow foreign countries to undermine British democracy, saying digital currencies “may play a role in future political interference schemes”.Government sources said on Tuesday the strengthening of general rules regarding foreign interference would also apply to digital currencies.A government source said: “Protecting our democracy from hostile foreign interference is a central responsibility of government and that’s why we are taking action to ensure it continues to thrive for generations to come.“We want as many people as possible to engage in our democracy with confidence in the electoral process and our forthcoming reforms will help us do that.”Alongside the political financing changes, the elections paper is also expected to back votes from the age of 16 and encourage more voter registration.Explore more on these topicsParty fundingElectoral CommissionElectoral reformnewsShareReuse this content"

It happened after GHF guards used teargas or pepper spray on hungry crowds arriving at the centre, Palestinian health authorities and witnesses said.Nineteen people were crushed and one stabbed in a “chaotic and dangerous surge” on Wednesday morning, GHF said in a statement. It did not respond to questions about the use of pepper spray or teargas by its staff at the site near Khan Younis.Fifteen people died from suffocation after teargas was fired at the crowd, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement.“All of the 15 arrived at the hospital already dead with obvious symptoms of lack of oxygen. You can see blue marks, vomit, blue lips, swelling faces – all symptoms of suffocation,” Dr Mohammed Zaqqout, the director of hospitals for Gaza, said. “We couldn’t save any of the 15 we received because they were already dead on arrival.”Abdel Ghani Rouqa’s 20-year-old nephew, Mohammad, was among the dead.“The tents are completely empty now, lacking any food or drink, so people, with no other options or alternatives, are forced to go to dangerous areas just to get a can of fava beans or hummus, or even a few kilograms of flour, anything to feed their hungry families,” Rouqa said.“Unfortunately, when Mohammad went there today, the place was extremely crowded. The Israeli army had narrowed the area and created some passages for people to walk through,” he added.“What happened today was that, with the army firing teargas canisters at the densely packed crowd in front of the aid distribution gates, panic broke out. People started pushing and rushing to flee the area.”“Mohammad fell to the ground and couldn’t get up or escape. As the panicked crowd fled, they stepped on him, some on his stomach or back, some on his head, and others on his legs until he lost his life,” his uncle said. “The main cause of the chaos and deaths of more than 20 people was the firing of gas bombs.”GHF rejected the accounts provided by relatives and the Gaza health authorities and instead blamed the incident on Hamas.Chapin Fay, a GHF spokesperson, said: “Make no mistake, this tragic incident was no accident. This was a calculated provocation, part of a pattern of targeted efforts by Hamas and its allies to dismantle our life-saving operations.“GHF personnel identified a large number of people within the crowd carrying pistols. One American GHF worker, a medical professional, was targeted by a suspected Hamas affiliate with a pistol.“The medic attempted to tackle him, but in the process, the Hamas affiliate fled the site, and the medic was stabbed by another Hamas affiliate with an ice pick-like weapon.”Fay said no teargas was deployed, but pepper spray was used, “only to protect against additional loss of life”.He added that warning shots were fired in the air to disperse the crowd when a GHF worker saw a child in danger of being crushed, and that the GHF worker was able to save the child.In an earlier statement, GHF said that the trampling deaths were “the result of a surge instigated by armed Hamas agitators who infiltrated the crowd”.Fay said 19 people had been trampled to death, and another died from stab wounds.“The 19 victims who were trampled likely died due to compressive asphyxia, otherwise known as suffocation, which is the leading cause of death in these types of incidents,” he said in an online briefing.The deaths marked a grim milestone for Palestinians in a war where Israeli attacks have already killed more than 58,000 people, the majority of them civilians. On Tuesday 13 members of the same family, including seven children, were reported killed when an Israeli airstrike hit their home in eastern Gaza City. Some of the victims were left to die under the rubble, as the Israeli military prevented rescuers from approaching the scene for roughly eight hours with the use of drone strikes, local rescue workers and family memberstold the Haaretz newspaper.Israeli forces have killed at least 800 Palestinians while they were trying to access food since the GHF began operations in late May. Many of them were trying to reach a GHF distribution site. The deaths on Wednesday were the first at a site controlled by the organisation’s armed security guards. Gaza health authorities also said they were the first “due to suffocation and severe stampedes”.GHF, a startup organisation with no experience of distributing food in complex conflict zones, says it bears no responsibility for deaths outside its perimeters. The Trump administration announced on Tuesday it would donate $30m (£22m) to the organisation, a move decried as “outrageous” by the Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen.Van Hollen referred to GHF as a “shadowy group at the centre of the scheme to replace humanitarian aid orgs in Gaza with mercenaries, leading to the killing of starving civilians trying to collect food”.“Taxpayers shouldn’t be paying for this outrage,” the senator said in asocial media post.GHF runs only four sites to feed 2 million people, in a territory where extreme hunger is widespread and food security experts have warned of looming famine. Food security experts say deaths are inevitable in a system with only four sites, which open for short, irregular periods, providing food for hundreds of thousands of desperately hungry people.Under the aid model run by the UN and major international humanitarian organisations, which fed Palestinians during nearly 20 months of war, there were more than 400 aid distribution points used to bring food into communities.Israeli authorities claimed they needed a new aid system because Hamas was diverting aid, but have not provided evidence to back up allegations that closely audited supply chains of UN and humanitarian agencies were compromised.William Christou in Beirut contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We know how that ends | Larry ElliottRead moreLord Turner, who took over as chair of theFinancial Services Authorityduring the 2008 crash and played a leading role in the post-crisis redesign of the banking system, also warned the chancellor to proceed with caution.He said: “The costs of getting it wrong far outweigh the gains from loosening the requirements and allowing riskier activity by banks.”Lord Tyrie, who chaired the post-crisis parliamentary commission on banking standards, said it would be “imprudent” to scrap ringfencing after banks had invested huge sums in separating retail banking from their riskier activities. Now a Conservative peer, he warned in 2012 that the ringfence needed “electrification” to discourage banks from lobbying future governments.He said: “As the banking commission, which I chaired, strongly argued, it needs to be kept under constant review and where necessary adapted. From the Mansion House speech we have very little information about what is intended so far. Succumbing to lobbying in the misplaced belief that watering it down would somehow release the economy to a higher growth path would be a serious misjudgment.”Reeves on Tuesday committed to “meaningful reform” of the safeguards, with the government saying it would review the rules in an effort to strike a balance between ensuring financial stability and supporting economic growth.However, Vickers said: “Nothing is perfect, I am sure that its [ringfencing] implementation is capable of improvement. But a radical rowing back on it would be a very bad idea.“It would remove a layer of protection, for the everyday banking that firms and households depend on, from global shocks. Look what happened last time. I am not saying ringfencing would have prevented 2008-09, which was a global event. But the damage to the UK, including to UK growth prospects, would have been much lower if we had such a regime in place.”As recently as last month the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, warned ministers against watering down the rules, arguing that it could lead major banks to funnel more cash to their global investment arms at the expense of British businesses and households.Earlier this year, the bosses of four of the UK’s biggest banks: HSBC, LloydsBankingGroup, NatWest and Santander UK, wrote to Reeves to lobby for the removal of the ringfencing rules, arguing that it was a drag on lending to the British economy.However, Baileywrote in a letter to the Commons Treasury committeethat ringfenced banks faced “no restrictions on lending” to UK firms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would increase risk for no benefit.”Turner said it was important to review City rules, but cautioned: “The fundamentals of the reforms we put in place – the ringfencing of retail activities and the capital requirements on systemically important banks – need to remain the bedrock of UK regulation.”The Treasury said it would work with the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority to consider if ringfenced banks could provide more products and services to UK businesses, if inefficiencies could be tackled, and if banks should be allowed to share resources and services more flexibly across the ringfence.Led by the Treasury minister, Emma Reynolds, the review would report by early 2026.It said: “The government is committed to upholding the ringfencing regime to protect financial stability and safeguard depositors. However, the government also intends to take forward meaningful reforms to the regime to support its growth agenda.”Explore more on these topicsBankingRachel ReevesLabourEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

She alleged the event supported an ideology that gender can be chosen.The ruling foundVanessa Jardine, the chief constable, was wrong to allow uniformed officers to take part, marching in uniform bearing Pride flags and painting a police van in colours supporting the event.The judgment listed slogans displayed during the march, which police did not dispute.These included: “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, “Toute le monde deteste la police”, “Northumbria police, off our Pride”, “Intifada don’t deny it, Stonewall was a fucking riot” and “Queers for free Palestine”.Nationally, police chiefs are rushing to understand the judgment and its potential scope. One police source spoke of hearing concerns that forces could not be officially represented at Remembrance parades, events in support of the armed services, or community and religious celebrations, if anyone could object.However, another said the ruling was “absolutely right”, adding: “If you are in uniform, you are on duty … to police without fear or favour.”In his judgment, Mr Justice Linden wrote: “The claimant describes herself as a lesbian who is ‘gender critical’. She believes that a person’s sex is an immutable characteristic and that ‘gender ideology’, which recognises a person’s gender identity, is ‘wrong and dangerous’.“Her evidence is that gender ideology has been embraced by the organisers of the event … and was supported by many of the participants in the event, who also strongly oppose gender-critical beliefs.“She objects to what she sees as the force and/or members of the force associating themselves with the views of supporters of gender ideology and transgender activists by actively participating in the event.”The judge made clear he was not ruling on the merits of the highly charged transgender debate, but whether a body could officially support a disputed cause without breaching a duty of impartiality it was legally bound to observe.The case was supported by a group called Fair Cop, which alleges policing is blighted by excessive political correctness and was founded by Harry Miller, a former officer.In his witness statement, Miller said the chief constable “marched in the immediate proximity of those carrying the flags and emblems clearly associated with the gender ideologists’ cause”.He added that banners saying “Trans women are women” and “Trans rights are human rights”, plus “the intersectional flag and the blue, pink and white transgender pride flag” signalled a political association “in a similar way to how someone shouting ‘build a wall’ or ‘make America great again’ signals an association with Donald Trump”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionReaching his decision, the judge said of the chief constable: “Her participation in the march was likely to be seen, and may well have been intended to be seen, as expressing the support of the head of the force for the views and the cause which the march sought to promote, and therefore as indicating the position or perspective of the force as an organisation.”The judge said all the force’s actions at the event gave “the impression that the force as a whole was associating itself with a particular viewpoint and, as far as gender-critical people were concerned, taking sides.”Linzi Smith said: “It is terrifying to live in a community where the police have abandoned their duty of impartiality and embraced a highly controversial political cause. I’ve experienced firsthand what happens when the police forget their duty of impartiality. I posted some gender-critical tweets, and Northumbria police launched an investigation into my conduct – but when I received appalling homophobic abuse as a lesbian, they did absolutely nothing.”Northumbria police said: “We recognise not all communities share the same level of confidence in policing for a variety of reasons. We want to ensure everyone knows that we are absolutely here for them when they need us.“Part of that is us being visible in those communities and playing an active part in our force area. Throughout the year, we will have an important role to play in a variety of events, including parades and festivals.“During these events, while our primary aim is to keep people safe, it also provides us with an opportunity to engage with people, including those who may have less confidence in policing.“It is vitally important they feel supported and we continue to build their trust in us.”Smith’s lawyer, Paul Conrathe,said the judgment may have repercussions for other bodies with a duty of impartiality, such as the BBC, “if they align themselves with a controversial cause”.Explore more on these topicsPolicePrideLGBTQ+ rightsNewcastleGenderNorth of EnglandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He added that stopping work on tackling the climate crisis would risk the loss of external funding. It ran the risk of less money to invest in social care, he said. “This is not an either-or.”During a sometimes fractious and bad-tempered debate on Wednesday, the Reform council leader, Andrew Husband, said the authority was now driven by data and common sense.“During the Roman-occupied era not far away from County Durham, around 45AD, there is evidence of Roman vineyards along Hadrian’s Wall. This is because the Roman period in Britain is known for having a relatively warm climate which would have been conducive to growing grapes. Mind, how the climate has changed,” he said.Kenny Hope, a Reform councillor, accused the Lib Dems of being in favour of adult and child slave labour. He said the mining of material for lithium batteries was “rife with child slavery” as was the production of solar panels in China.“I do not believe in child or adult slave labour and I believe the guys on this side of the house also do not believe in it. But I believe the guys on the other side must believe in adult or child slave labour because they have not took that into consideration,” he said.Darren Grimes, a former GB News presenter, prolific tweeter and now deputy leader of the council,proposed the motionand accused his opponents of wanting to make local residents “colder and poorer … shame. Shame. Shame.”He said Durham was done “with expensive virtue-signalling tripe” and said the 2019 declaration was “a feel-good” one chasing “net-zero rainbows while the likes of China belch out coal more than Sauron’s Mordor”.Afterwards, Jonathan Elmer, one of the council’s two Green members, described some of what he heard in the debate as “bonkers”.He said the vote represented “a very dark day” for the council. “Eighty per cent of the population do believe in the climate emergency and want to do something about it. Durham has an administration that doesn’t. They’ve got a head-in-the-sand, don’t-look-up approach,” Elmer said.Wilkes said he was concerned for his nine-year-old son. “I want to know he can grow up and live in a country and on a planet that is safe. There is a personal aspect to everything, isn’t there?”On Monday, the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, warned MPs about the climate crisis,saying he would explicitly call out politicianswho rejected net zero policies for betraying future generations.The duration of the Durham council debate was short because of rules limiting it to 30 minutes. A move by Wilkes to have a fuller debate was voted down by Reform.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The previous administration set no budget to fund net zero, and instead set undeliverable targets that, if attempted, would likely send the council bust.”Explore more on these topicsCounty DurhamClimate crisisReform UKGreenhouse gas emissionsLocal governmentNorth of EnglandNorthamptonshirenewsShareReuse this content"

The charities want a key section of the legislation, part 3, scrapped entirely because they say it is a“licence to kill nature”.Leading figures from the organisations were summoned by the government to a meeting last Friday where officials put forward nine amendments to the language of the bill, which they say offer greater environmental protections. In return for accepting these, ministers want the nature groups to stop their campaign, the Guardian has established from several sources.Angela Rayner, the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, has had a statement supporting the bill prepared for the charities to sign, which says: “These amendments will provide confidence that our reforms will truly deliver for nature and help us recover our most precious sites and species as we work to get Britain building.”Peers will debate scrapping part 3 when the bill goes before them on Thursday in the House of Lords.One participant in the meeting said their organisation “will take some persuading”.Another source from a charity said: “There is a lot of pressure. There is this deal trying to be struck by Angela Rayner’s department, essentially so that we go quiet, or even better that we back the bill. But at the moment what’s been offered in the meetings is not enough for us; we are not convinced.”The environmental charities summoned to the meetings – theRSPB, National Trust, Wildlife Trusts, and Wildlife and Countryside Link – have 8 million members between them.Some members are concerned at the nature of the proposed deal and the methods being used. One source said: “They cannot make deals in backrooms like this, [the NGOs] have to come to us with this. There is a great deal of unease around this. We are not going to stop campaigning against this bill.”As yet there has been no agreement from the NGOs to either sign the statement or stop their campaigns.Richard Benwell, the CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, confirmed that the groups were talking to the government. He said: “As it stands, the bill skews the scales much too far away from the crucial safeguards nature needs. We hope ministers make the significant and wide-ranging amendments needed to reset the balance for nature and ensure that the planning system gives strong protection to vulnerable habitats and species and contributes to nature recovery.”The bill has been deemed a“regression” of environmental lawby the chair of the government’s own watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection, and two independent legal opinions. It would allow developers to sidestep current environmental law and build without assessing the damage to protected wildlife and habitats, as long as they pay a levy into a central nature recovery fund.The Guardian has revealedthat more than 5,000 of England’s most precious protected sites are at high risk of being destroyed by development as a result, according to legal analysis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Rhetoric from Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves and Rayner has pitted nature as a blocker to development. But the government’sown impact assessmentstates there is almost no evidence for this claim.More than 100,000 people havesigned a petitionagainst the bill and thousands have contacted their MPs over the threat to nature.On Thursday, peers will begin line by line consideration of the legislation. Amendments being considered include one from Lord Roborough, Conservative shadow Defra minister in the Lords, to scrap part 3.Alexa Culver, an environmental lawyer with RSK Wilding, said major problems with the bill had not been addressed by the suggested changes. “Back-room bargains are being made about our natural environment and our economy, which are leading to the ‘worst of all worlds’ amendments,” she said.A government spokesperson said: “We’ve inherited a system that has blocked homes, infrastructure and economic growth while doing nothing for nature’s recovery, and we are determined to fix this. We have committed to only act in legislation where we can confirm to parliament that the steps we are taking will deliver positive environmental outcomes.“We note the support of the Office for Environmental Protection for the intentions behind our reforms and continue to carefully consider their advice. Our planning and infrastructure bill will mean a win-win for both nature and the economy, and we are always listening to views about how we make sure our reforms are as effective as possible so we can leave a lasting legacy of environmental improvement.”Explore more on these topicsPlanning policyEnvironmental activismRSPBThe National TrustnewsShareReuse this content"

The plants include 45 plant species on the verge of extinction, and while some can be dug up and placed in containers for relocation, others will be delicately propagated.The imposing Grade I-listed Victorian structure will have each of its 16,000 panes of glass replaced and recycled, while its soaring wrought-iron frame will be stripped, repaired and encased with a hi-tech waterproof paint in the exact shade of white used when the Palm House was first opened to the public in 1848.But perhaps the biggest change will be the replacing of the Palm House’s ancient gas-fired boiler system and leaky pipework with state-of-the-art air source and water source heat pumps.According to the gardens’ accounts and annual report, Kew generated £369m for the UK economy in 2023. The renovation of the Palm House and its little sister, the Waterlily House, which account for more than a fifth of Kew Gardens’ carbon emissions, is part of its plan to become climate positive by 2030. Other carbon reduction changes will reduce energy use by 49% across the 200-hectare (500-acre) site.Tom Pickering, the head of glasshouse collections at Kew, said: “At the heart of this project is the need to protect the extraordinary plant collections housed in the Palm House and Waterlily House. Besides being beautiful, many have cultural, scientific and conservation value, and replacing these collections is unimaginable. Achieving net zero in these historic buildings is an unprecedented task, it’s a complex challenge, which must consider the interplay of horticulture, climatic control, engineering, and architecture.”The redesigned interior of the Palm House will be more accessible and have more places for visitors to sit and wonder at the tropical rainforest collections. Planning permission for the project has been submitted, with funding coming from central government, the Julia Rausing Trust, the World Monuments Fund and other donors.The renovation is likely to start in 2027, with the exact date dependent on planning permission and funding.Explore more on these topicsKew GardensGreenhouse gas emissionsPlantsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Rivers thread through open moorland past towering rocky outcrops. Radioactive-coloured lichens cling to 300m-year-old boulders. Bronze age burial mounds and standing stones are reminders that humans have been drawn here for thousands of years. It is considered one of the UK’smost beautifuland precious landscapes.Much of this moorland is officially protected as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) because it is considered home to the country’s most valued wildlife. Its blanket bogs, heathlands and high altitude oak woodlands are treasure troves of nature.But the wildlife that once depended on these habitats is vanishing. Dartmoor is known for its diverse birdlife, but breedingpopulations ofgolden plover, red grouse and ring ouzel have disappeared, or are on the verge of local extinction.Conceived of75 years ago, there are 15 national parks across the UK, designed so every citizen could immerse themselves in nature and beautiful landscapes. But their beauty can be misleading – experts say many of the landscapes that are formally recognised for their rich natural heritage are actually deserts for biodiversity.View image in fullscreenAbout 850 farmers, or commoners as they are known, have the right to keep sheep, cattle and ponies on Dartmoor“We have become so used to these landscapes,” says author and campaigner Guy Shrubsole, who advocates for Right to Roam on Dartmoor. “Good geology hides a lot of problems. We’re admiring rocks and not what should be a living ecosystem.”We’re admiring rocks and not what should be a living ecosystemGuy Shrubsole, campaignerIn some cases, species and habitats arein a worse conditionwithin national parks than they are outside them. In May, Natural England released its latest assessment of Dartmoor’s three largest protected sites, which cover nearly a quarter of the national park. The results show just0.1% of themare in a favourable condition. The amount of land area in an unfavourable and declining condition has doubled since the last assessment in 2013.“Dartmoor is dying,” says Tony Whitehead, a Dartmoor nature campaigner, who crunched the Natural England data.View image in fullscreenThe conservation campaigner Tony Whitehead, left, with author Guy Shrubsole, walk on Hen TorNational parks should be at the heart of the government’s pledge to protect 30% of land by 2030, but estimates suggestless than 3%of land in England is actually being protected. “What should be the best is the worst,” says Whitehead. “They are absolutely failing.”‘We could lose the heather altogether’Hen Tor is a one hour walk up from Trowlesworthy car park. This landscape – which falls within South Dartmoor special interest area – used to be known for its carpets of purple heather at this time of year.But today, finding any heather at all is hard work. Getting down on our knees, we spot a handful of heather flowers hidden among the grasses. Tiny bits of bilberry – which once formed dense bushes – cling on around stones. Floral diversity has been replaced by a uniform expanse of grass, grazed close to the ground by sheep.View image in fullscreenA combination of overgrazing and moorland burning leaves these areas in poor ecological health.In winter, when this grass is sparse, sheep turn to the heather and bilberry. According toNatural England, this is leading to a “sharp decline in heather cover”. Monitoring data suggests heather cover has dropped from 25% to 1% in some areas of Dartmoor in recent years. “We could lose the heather altogether,” says Whitehead. “It’s almost all gone. What is happening here is replicated on other commons around the moor.”This is [now] your bog-standard rough grazing landTony WhiteheadAt the top of the hill, a mantle of deep peat sits on top of the moor like icing on a sticky bun. But due to historic extraction and repeated burning it is in a poor state. Degraded peat has encouraged the spread of vast stretches of purple moor grass. Monocultures of the species nowsmothermany upland areas, creating ecological dead zones. Deep scars – peat hags – have opened like wounds. Just1% of Dartmoor’s deep peatis considered to be healthy.View image in fullscreenThe nature campaigner Tony WhiteheadConsequences trickle down. These habitats should be a stronghold for nationally declining birds such as ring ouzel, curlew, tree pipit and whinchat, but they are increasingly rare to see.“If you ever had to describe a desert that is on a common, it is here,” says Whitehead. “It’s just desperate – the place is bleached, it’s a dead zone and I know how rich it could be. This is the exemplar of a bad site but it is not an anomaly.”If it were assessed again today, Whitehead says this landscape would not be designated an SSSI. None of the features that made it special are here any more. “This is [now] your bog-standard rough grazing land across uplands across the UK,” says WhiteheadA failing systemAt the root of the issue is land ownership. Most land within national parks is privately owned and, particularly in the uplands, used for grazing by farm animals. In Dartmoor, just7.5% of landis publicly owned, and conservation is seen as secondary to economic interests.Across UK upland national parks, overgrazing and moorland burning are driving these areas into poor ecological health, and a heating climate is heaping on the pressure.Conservationbodies and park authorities often have limited funding to monitor and restore ecosystems.In 2024the first full assessmentof how national parks are supporting nature recovery found that just 6% of park land in England and Wales is being managed effectively for nature.View image in fullscreenMost land within national parks is privately owned, and, particularly in the uplands, it is used for grazingMike Madgwick, from the National Trust – which owns Hen Tor – says Natural England’s latest assessments are consistent with the trust’s own monitoring, which he described as “deeply concerning”.Sheep are destroying precious British habitats – and we taxpayers are footing the bill | Chris PackhamRead more“These landscapes are nationally important for their wildlife, heritage, and beauty. The National Trust is committed to reversing this decline,” says Madgwick.He acknowledged that the current system was failing: “While the Trust has worked within the frameworks available, including government-funded schemes, we acknowledge that these have not delivered the ecological outcomes needed.”The 2024 assessment, by Campaign for National Parks, found a chronic lack of funding was preventing park authorities from improving the situation. The parks’ direct grant funding from government has been cut by 40% in real terms since 2010. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature,none of the UK national parksmeet the international definition of a protected area.View image in fullscreenDeep scars, known as peat hags, have opened in the landscapePressure is mounting to improve the situation. The campaign group Wild Justice has launcheda legal challengeto the Dartmoor Commoners’ Council (DCC) for failing to meet legal environmental duties. The hearing was held in the high court on 15 July.The land in the Dartmoor case is used by farmers – called commoners – with rights to graze livestock on the land.There are about 850 commoners, or owners of properties on the commons, who have rights permitting them to keep sheep, cattle and ponies.David Wolfe KC, for Wild Justice, said in written submissions that DCC has failed “to ensure that the commons are not overstocked” and has not issued any limitation notices “in the last 10 years”. He asked the court to order DCC to comply with its statutory duties and carry out an assessment of the number of animals that can graze, as well as order it to issue limitation notices.View image in fullscreenThe Dartmoor Commoners’ Council say that natural beauty ‘is a core consideration’ in their members’ farming practicesThe DCC says it has made assessments of overgrazing, and its legal representative said natural beauty “is a core consideration”.The case concludes on 16 July and a written judgment is expected at a later date.The DCC denies that it has breached those duties “either as alleged or at all, and has defended the proceedings accordingly”.Signs of life – in the car parkView image in fullscreenTiny heather plants found near Hen Tor. Monitoring data suggests heather cover has dropped from 25% to 1% in some areasWithin the crags of Hen Tor itself, tiny oases of life survive. Protected from grazing, a bilberry bush and mountain ash tree are thriving. Likewise, around the car park in the valley, a wealth of bracken and scrubby trees attract garden warblers, blackcaps and thrushes.Ironically, it is these edge landscapes – protected from the pressures of grazing – that hold the most biodiversity, and show what this land could still be. “Dartmoor still has some amazing places, but they are small,” says Whitehead.Common people: the New Forest women following ancient traditionRead moreDespite decades of overgrazing,small heather shootscan still be found – albeit in a fragile state – which means restoration would be possible, if done soon enough. “This land needs a rest, there should be no sheep here over winter”, says Whitehead, who says if sheep stocking densities were lower, the land would start to bloom again.If not, ecologists believe the wildlife that once lived here will become a relic of the past – the place where the wild things once were.The quiet crisis unfolding here is not isolated but repeated across UK national parks. Understanding what is happening means looking more closely – not just at the beautiful scenery, but all that is missing too.​This article was amended on 16 July 2025 to remove wording which suggested that all the land in the case brought by Wild Justice was owned by the National Trust.Explore more on these topicsNational parksThe age of extinctionBiodiversityConservationWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Peggie was accused of misconduct, failures of patient care and misgendering Upton.ButNHSFife confirmed on Wednesday that an internal hearing had concluded there was “insufficient evidence to support a finding of misconduct”.Peggie’s solicitor, Margaret Gribbon, described her client – who was suspended from work at Victoria hospital in January 2024 – as “relieved and delighted” at the outcome of the 18-month internal process.NHS Fife and Upton are defending their actions in an employment tribunal case against the trust that resumed on Wednesday after a five-month break.The tribunal hearing is being watched closely for how it may be influenced byApril’s landmark judgmentby the supreme court that the legal definition of a woman in the Equality Act 2010 does not include transgender women who hold gender recognition certificates. The ruling has since been publicly welcomed by Peggie and her supporters.In earlier evidence, Peggie said she had felt “embarrassed and intimidated” when Upton started to get changed alongside her, leading to a heated exchange, the details of which are disputed.The health board has previously described Peggie’s action as “unnecessary and vexatious”. Upton is also disputing it.NHS Fife’s equality lead, Isla Bumba, told NHS Fife’s counsel, Jane Russell KC, that in August 2023, her line manager, Esther Davidson, had asked for “very generic and informal” advice on how best to accommodate a new trans member of staff, “particularly around changing rooms”.The advice was based on the Equality and Human Rights Commissions’s statutory code of practice, which is currently being revised to reflect the supreme court’s ruling.Bumba told the hearing: “I said it could be deemed discriminatory to not allow a trans person access to facilities that aligned with their gender, but I recommended that it might be worthwhile having a conversation with the person directly if they had been open about their trans status to see where they would be most comfortable.”She confirmed to Russell that she was not aware of any other cases of staff objecting to trans employees using changing facilities that aligned with their lived gender to date, and that no other female staff had approached her to say they felt their safety, privacy or dignity were being compromised.Bumba was later questioned by Peggie’s lawyer, Naomi Cunningham, who asked whether the health board’s approach to allowing Upton to use the women’s facilities amounted to forcing female colleagues “to participate in a pretence” that Upton was a woman. “I disagree,” said Bumba firmly.She later denied that she wanted to “see Sandie Peggie punished” for her gender-critical views, telling Cunningham “that’s quite a leap”. Earlier she accepted that, while she believed that trans women were women, there were others who did not. “I believe gender is a spectrum and people’s views on gender will also be a spectrum”.As the tribunal continues, the first minister, John Swinney, insisted that NHS Fife – which has spent at least £220,000 defending its actions – “has my confidence and support”, while Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, Jackie Baillie, called on NHS Fife to settle the tribunal case “and brings this sorry saga to an end”.Explore more on these topicsTransgenderScotlandEquality Act 2010DoctorsNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

That is why they have called for a public inquiry.”As well as the Amess case, the report looks at how Prevent handled the case of the Southport murderer Axel Rudakubana, and finds a new potential missed opportunity.As first revealed in the Guardian, Prevent declined to take on the case three times, after teachers raised concerns about him from 2019 to 2021, three years before he committed the atrocity.His first referral was from his teachers after he admitted bringing a knife into school on 10 occasions to “stab someone”, researched massacres of children at US schools and made “graphic” comments about violence. He later said “the [2017] terrorist attack on the MEN [Manchester Arena] was a good thing”.While there was concern about his interest in violence, Prevent concluded there was no sign it was driven by a terrorist ideology.The report says one expert concluded Rudakubana’s case should be examined by Channel, but that did not happen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in neither case did it do so.”The report recommends a potential dramatic expansion of Prevent, to include “individuals who have no fixed ideology but a fascination with extreme violence or mass casualty attacks”.Anderson also says Prevent “could function better if formally connected to a broader safeguarding and violence protection system”.The report recommends: “A Cabinet Office task force should be established to lead exploratory work into the possibility of formally connecting Prevent to a broader safeguarding and violence prevention system.”​Anderson says: “I commend the teachers who were concerned that each of these youths was on a dangerous path, years before their crimes were committed. They did the right thing by referring them to Prevent. But in neither case did Prevent do what was needed to engage with them and protect the public.“Success is never guaranteed, but the process can work with the help of skilled and committed practitioners, and often does so.“When Prevent is offered a chance and fails to take it, it is vital that all possible lessons are learned.​”Anderson says Prevent reforms undertaken and planned should make such failings harder to recur and adds:“Prevent needs to up its game in the online world, where most radicalisation now takes place. It needs to get better at information sharing, and be more open with the public to gain the trust on which it depends.”Explore more on these topicsPrevent strategyUK security and counter-terrorismSouthport attacknewsShareReuse this content"

She called on the government to learn from past failings and consult former detainees, as well as the families of those currently detained.“While the government commitment to appoint a special envoy to lead on the issue is welcome, this risks being meaningless and only an extension of inconsistent policy which plays into the hands of regimes deploying a hostage diplomacy tactic, unless the individual appointed is of significant stature, with the experience, remit and resources to negotiate for British citizens’ release and support families,” said Kearns.As well as continued calls for the envoy appointment and on the government to prioritise cases, relatives and lawyers of some of those arbitrarily detained abroad have told the Guardian of the difficulties they have faced in getting help.Haydee Dijkstal, counsel forAhmed al-Doush, a British national convicted in Saudi Arabia and sentenced to 10 years in jail over social media posts – now reduced to eight – said the family continues to plead for the government to act with urgency.“It is critical that the UK government demand full clarity and transparency about the treatment and proceedings against a British national, and take a firm and clear position that Ahmed is being arbitrarily detained,” she said. Relatives and representatives involved with high-profile cases who met Middle East minister Hamish Falconer in recent weeks to discuss the special envoy appointment, described the meeting as “awful” as concerns were raised over promises made by the foreign secretary they feared would not be met.“I saw no evidence that any thought had been given to design,” said Chris Pagett, the brother-in-law of Ryan Cornelius and a former civil servant, who attended the meeting. “I have very little hope, unless a lot changes.”Kingsley Kanu, the brother of Nnamdi Kanu, a British national arrested in Kenya but who is being held inNigeriaafter falling victim to extraordinary rendition, has had no communication with the UK government, and said his brother, who is currently on trial, has not had a consular visit in two months.“I was thinking the government of Keir Starmer would have done better,” said Kanu. “All of them have ignored the issue of my brother.”In May, his brother, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob), a prominent separatist movement proscribed in Nigeria, wrote to the British high commissioner to Nigeria asking for his case to be publicly acknowledged as unlawful.The letter said: “Silence and procedure equivocation in the face of criminal acts carried out against a British citizen abroad do not represent diplomatic prudence; they represent dereliction of duty.”An FCDO Spokesperson said: “The government is committed to strengthening support for British nationals, including through the appointment of a new envoy.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsDubaiDavid LammynewsShareReuse this content"

Astronomers have been thinking about how planetary systems form for a long period of time,” Ciesla said. “There’s a rich opportunity here.”Nasa’s Webb Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory in Chile teamed up to reveal these early nuggets of planetary formation around the young star known as Hops-315. It’s a yellow dwarf in the making like the sun, yet much younger at 100,000 to 200,000 years old and about 1,370 light-years away. A single light-year is 6tn miles.In a cosmic first, McClure and her team stared deep into the gas disk around the baby star and detected solid specks condensing – signs of early planet formation. A gap in the outer part of the disk allowed them to gaze inside, thanks to the way the star tilts toward Earth.They detected silicon monoxide gas as well as crystalline silicate minerals, the ingredients for what is believed to be the first solid materials to form in our solar system more than 4.5bn years ago. The action is unfolding in a location comparable to the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter containing the leftover building blocks of our solar system’s planets.The condensing of hot minerals was never detected before around other young stars, “so we didn’t know if it was a universal feature of planet formation or a weird feature of our solar system”, McClure said in an email. “Our study shows that it could be a common process during the earliest stage of planet formation.”While other research has looked at younger gas disks and, more commonly, mature disks with potential planet wannabes, there has been no specific evidence for the start of planet formation until now, McClure said.In a stunning picture taken by the ESO’s Alma telescope network, the emerging planetary system resembles a lightning bug glowing against the black void.It’s impossible to know how many planets might form around Hops-315. With a gas disk as huge as the sun’s might have been, it could also wind up with eight planets a million or more years from now, according to McClure.Purdue University’s Merel van ’t Hoff, a co-author, is eager to find more budding planetary systems. By casting a wider net, astronomers can look for similarities and determine which processes might be crucial to forming Earth-like worlds.“Are there Earth-like planets out there or are we like so special that we might not expect it to occur very often?”Explore more on these topicsAstronomyThe sunSpacePlanetsNasaNetherlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m aiming to keep his incredible legacy alive at this year’s PromsNicholas McCarthyWed 16 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 12.26 EDTShareIlove talking to people about piano music written for the left hand. It’s a corner of the repertoire that’s often seen as a mysterious niche – yet it comprises a handful of hidden gems for solo piano and a few celebrated concertos too.With most people, the conversation quickly turns to Ravel’s legendary Piano Concerto for the Left Hand (1929-30). This masterwork, a favourite among pianists, has been performed by some of the world’s greatest keyboard titans and – as a pianist born without my right hand – holds a special place in my own output. But there are a great deal more pieces for the left hand out there.The story begins in the early 19th century when concert pianists were cultural superstars. Liszt, for instance, packed out European concert halls in the same way that a modern day icon such as Taylor Swift sells out stadiums in minutes. These virtuosos enthralled their audiences with their technical brilliance and dramatic showmanship. And they often added an encore designed to astonish – such as performing dazzling feats of pyrotechnics using only their left hand. Using the so-called “weaker” hand to deliver a bravura display was irresistible to concertgoers, and the spectacle would leave them in awe.The trick lay in the aural illusion: left-hand works often create the impression of two or even three hands playing simultaneously, deceiving even the savviest listeners. Though the left hand tends to be weaker, its physiology gives it an advantage. In standard two-handed piano repertoire the melody line is mostly projected in the right hand by the little finger, the weakest of the fingers. But in left-hand repertoire the melody line is projected by the thumb, the strongest digit, giving it greater clarity. This is why there are more than 3,000 works for left hand alone, yet only a few for the right hand. Another important element in the left-hand pianist’s toolkit is the sustain pedal. This allows bass notes to remain present in the texture creating a fuller sound, similar to that which two hands can achieve.View image in fullscreenPioneering … Paul Wittgenstein in New York in 1934 ahead of a concert tour of the US.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveThe development of serious left-hand repertoire beyond encore and novelty pieces, give or take a few real left-hand gems, did not occur until the 20th century, in the aftermath of the first world war. At the centre of this evolution was Paul Wittgenstein (1887-1961) whose story would for ever alter the course of left-hand-alone music.A member of the prominent Viennese Wittgenstein family, Paul was the son of a wealthy steel magnate and the brother of renowned philosopher Ludwig. The family was deeply embedded in European high society, with close connections to some of the greatest names in art, music and culture. Paul was a gifted pianist who made his concert debut in 1913. But the outbreak of war would soon change his life for ever.Having enlisted in the Austro-Hungarian army, Wittgenstein was seriously injured fighting the Russian army in the Battle of Galicia, losing his right arm. This was tragically a common wartime injury: right-handed soldiers often suffered damage to their dominant limb during combat. Taken prisoner after the battle, Wittgenstein was moved to a Siberian camp. Here he etched out the lines of a piano keyboard in charcoal on the base of an upturned wooden crate, spending several hours a day hammering the phantom keys with his remaining hand. A visiting dignitary, witnessing this poignant and unusual sight, arranged for him to be transferred to a camp where there was an upright piano. Wittgenstein set to work figuring out how to play the pieces he adored – but with his left hand alone.Repatriated to Vienna in 1915, Wittgenstein faced the monumental challenge of reinventing himself as a one-handed pianist. With steely determination (and his family’s immense wealth and elite connections), he set out to build a career. He commissioned some of the most celebrated composers of the era to write works for him. These included concertos by Prokofiev, Strauss, Britten, Korngold and Hindemith. Wittgenstein did not perform every piece he commissioned. He told Prokofiev that he did not understand his4th Piano Concerto: “The inner logic of the work is not clear to me, and, of course I can’t play it until it is.” He quarrelled with other composers over changes he demanded to their scores.Among the works he commissioned was Ravel’s aforementioned Piano Concerto for the Left Hand. Yet even that iconic work was not scandal-free: Wittgenstein made changes to the score for the premiere.Ravel was incensed, and the pair only reconciled after Wittgenstein agreed to perform it as originally written.The concerto is a triumph of ingenuity and artistry. Though it was composed at around the same time asRavel’s other Piano Concerto, for two hands, the works are poles apart – each a unique testament to the composer’s mastery of orchestration and piano writing. I vividly remember hearing it for the first time as a 15-year-old. Its opening captivated me immediately: an ominous visceral rumble from the orchestra that gradually unfolds into a majestic theme, rising through the low growl of the instruments. All the while the pianist sits in suspense waiting for their dramatic entrance. The attention is electric, and ice-cold nerves are required from the soloist as they prepare for their moment of brilliance.View image in fullscreen‘Specialising in this extraordinary repertoire is a privilege, a responsibility and, at times, a real challenge.’ Nicholas McCarthy.Photograph: Bernardo Arcos Mijailidis/Archivo: Arcos-AlcarazThroughout his life Ravel was inspired by the play of water. Jeux d’eau (Water Games, 1901), and Ondine (the water nymph) from Gaspard de la Nuit (1908) convey this beautifully. Yet, for me, his most water-like musical achievement comes in the left-hand concerto’s breathtaking extended cadenza, heard towards the end of the work. Here the piano becomes a shimmering cascade, rippling and flowing with crystalline beauty before building to a powerful conclusion.Specialising in this extraordinary repertoire is a privilege, a responsibility and, at times, a real challenge. If my forthcomingPromsperformance of the Ravel whets your appetite to hear more, I recommend the Britten Diversions for Piano Left Hand and Orchestra as well as Martinu’s Concertino (Divertimento), a lovely little gem of a work for chamber orchestra and piano left hand. And I confess I can’t agree with Wittgenstein about the work’s inner logic – I’ll be performing Prokofiev’s 4th Piano Concerto next year, and will also soon be adding Korngold’s glorious Piano Concerto for Left Hand to my repertoire.There are still preconceptions around disability and a career in music. As one of just a few classical soloists with a physical disability, I’ve had to be patient and resilient and to develop a thicker skin simply because I don’t fit into the correct box. But I hope I can inspire the next generation of pianists to explore this remarkable music. Just as Wittgenstein blazed a trail for me, I aspire to light the way for others, ensuring that the legacy of left-hand-alone music continues to thrive.Nicholas McCarthy performs Ravel’s Piano Concerto for the Left Hand at theProms on 20 July.

Though a cultural lightning rod when it aired from 2012 until 2017 – its whiteness, convincing narcissism, frank sexuality and frequent nudity all catnip for the cresting blogosphere and cyclical moral panic – Girls has rightfully settled into its status as one of the best television series of the 21st century, a foundational text for millennials as well as a biting satire of solipsistic, Obama-era striving. (Although viewers too young to remember it as anything other than canon now see the girls’ flailing – their freedom to wear terrible prints, listen to Vampire Weekend and be earnest – as something to be envied rather than derided, a core tenet of themillennial redemption arc.)Too Much review – Lena Dunham’s cliche-ridden new romcom is a total disappointmentRead moreThe show was always sharper than tendentious criticism acknowledged, a knowing send-up not to be taken too seriously, though it did seriously shape the TV that followed – the idea of an “unlikable” female protagonist was always ahistorical, but messy, compelling women on television proliferated in Hannah Horvath’s wake, from the girls of Broad City to Insecure’s Issa, Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag to Pamela Adlon’s Better Things. It is unfortunately still radical to see someone who looks like creator, writer and star Lena Dunham be naked on screen without judgment; though television has explored sex much more successfully than movies in the years since, no show has fully succeeded Girls’ unvarnished vision of sex as something both banal and essential. No wonder so many people arerewatching it.All of which is to say: expectations were high for Too Much, Dunham’s new TV series for Netflix. Though not her first project since Girls – she helmed HBO’s ill-fated series Camping, made two feature films (onemuch betterthanthe other) and directed the (excellent) pilot of Industry – Too Much is the first true follow-up to the show that made her a cultural flashpoint at the age of 26. From the jump, Jessica, played by the comedian Megan Stalter, appears as a natural successor to Dunham’s annoying but subtly endearing Horvath. Once again in Brooklyn, Jessica does something headstrong and inadvisable: she breaks into her ex-boyfriend Zev’s (Michael Zegen) apartment and screams him and his new girlfriend Wendy (longtime Dunham friend Emily Ratajkowski) awake, hysterically demanding that he declare leaving her to be the worst thing anyone has ever done.The amateur and ultimately futile home invasion is the first sign that Too Much will, like Girls before it, concern at least one prickly and off-putting character who is refreshingly and unashamedly not skinny. It is also the first sign that something is off. Whereas Hannah annoyed with a recognizable, skewering self-obsession, Jessica’s Too Much-ness – shocking volume, machine-gun delivery, inherent awkwardness – is a gag. Stalter comes from the world of front-facing camera internet comedy, where heightened bits and jarring phrases reign supreme (her best work – “hi, gay!” – will get stuck in your head for hours). The translation to television works in small parts, as in Hacks, but flounders as a lead, particularly one supposed to attract a handsome musician (Will Sharpe) at a pub and succeed as an advertising director while showing up to work in bunny ears.Dunham is now in her late 30s and married (her husband, the indie musician Luis Felber, co-created the show with her); no one will begrudge her avoiding a repeat of the Girls formula, which no show has been able to crack (Adultstried this spring, and failed). With Too Much, she steers far from any specific scene, instead focusing on the relationship between Jessica and Sharpe’s Felix, loosely based on her own. The 10-part romcom features the welcome presence of Dunham’s underrated acting, a buzzy lead in Stalter, a refreshingly grey vision of London, a murderers’ row of cameos – among them, Andrew Scott, Naomi Watts, Stephen Fry and Kit Harington – and sensitive scenes between two weirdo lovers. But without a scene or a trope to satirize – Dunham, through Jessica, is thoroughly enamored by English romcoms from Pride & Prejudice to Notting Hill – its comedy falters. Long on grating gags and short on zingers, Too Much is, and I say this begrudgingly, an overlong and underbaked disappointment.View image in fullscreenMeg Stalter and Lena Dunham.Photograph: PAIt is, however, very much of its era in television, when the downsides of the streaming boom have come into clearer focus. Episode lengths for Too Much vary from 31 minutes to a baggy 50+, less evidence of creative flexibility than a resistance to editing. Like Jessica’s favored nightgowns, the chapters are oversized and diaphanous, standard Netflix second-screen fare; some, such as the standout third episode depicting an accidental all-nighter punctuated by repeated, insistent sex as Jessica and Felix fall in love, believably advance their relationship with Dunham’s distinctive sense of erotic realism. Others, such as a Jessica meeting Felix’s friends and, true to form, doing too much ketamine, trap the characters in a cyclical loop of dysfunction. Dunham is, as the critic Lili Loofbourowput it, an excellent miniaturist – Too Much shines when the world falls away from Jessica and Felix, as they build the couple’s secret language of bits, vulnerabilities and callbacks. But as soon as the show meanders – to some egregiously overdrawn co-workers, to Jessica’s mother (Rita Wilson) on FaceTime across the pond, Dunham loses her grip. One scene, Jessica is getting a dressing-down from her boss (Richard E Grant) for her performance; the next, they’re bingeing coke at a work party at his house.Catherine Called Birdy review – Lena Dunham’s delightful medieval rompRead moreBut perhaps most disappointing to me, as a fan of Girls, is the show’s tenuous grip on the reality of the body. It is refreshing to see Stalter, a plus-size actor, play an unabashed character who generally gets what she wants, and whose romantic rivals are played by Ratajkowski, the epitome of conventional hot on Instagram, and the French movie star Adèle Exarchopoulos. It also feels a bit disingenuous to not acknowledge appearances at all, particularly when the culture isregressingback to the eating disorder-riddled “thin is in” of the 2000s. During one early sex scene, Felix lays a hand on Jessica’s bandaged stomach – always hapless, she burned herself – but does not grab her, as if he respects her curves, but does not crave her, as if they are beside the point of attraction.Such is the muted energy of Too Much, a show at once too broad and not enough. Dunham, once the tongue-in-cheek“voice of a generation”, has succeeded again – unfortunately this time, it’s in making Netflix background TV.Explore more on these topicsLena DunhamUS televisionNetflixTV comedyComedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its tales of bookseller-cum-semi-Sherlock are a TV joyLucy ManganWed 16 Jul 2025 16.10 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 19.11 EDTShareYou may feel that your cosy crime dance card is full. You’ve done all the Richard Osmans, polished off Ludwig and that new Timothy Spall one, Death Valley, not as bleak as it sounds, and of course there’s Father Brown to fall back on when you are ill and Agatha Raisin when you need cheering up. You’re good.But … as with a delicious box of chocolates, which is to say any box of chocolates, there’s always room for one more, isn’t there? And here it is, your next flavoursome nugget of absolute delight – Bookish. This six-part detective drama was created byMark Gatiss, written by Matthew Sweet and stars the former as Gabriel Book, a secondhand bookseller in postwar London. He carries a mysterious “letter from Churchill” as a result of his equally mysterious service in the war and this allows him to lend a hand with any passing police investigation that catches his eye. Think of him as a legitimised semi-Sherlock if you wish.In the opening double bill, Slightly Foxed – the perfect and inevitable pun under the circumstances – the eye-catching investigation involves a plague pit uncovered at a bombsite, the apparent suicide of a local chemist via prussic acid and a lavish strewing of clues (at least one of which Book finds almost too obvious, which makes it another kind of clue altogether) and complications (missing morphine, a bloodied head but no broken skin, on top of a poisoning? Rum, old boy, altogether rum). Possible suspects include the pharmacist’s semi-estranged daughter and her spiv boyfriend, the erstwhile ARP warden, Rosie Cavaliero’s char lady (called Mrs Dredge to give us some Dickensian undertones to enjoy) and there are red herrings (and jade figurines) and period detail along the way.Mix Tape review – nails the heart-stopping excitement of new loveRead moreThe latter ranges from the pleasingly traditional (whistleblowing bobbies, meat as a luxury item, the prevalence of powdered egg), through to the still more pleasingly niche (Georgette Heyer fandom and Book’s refusal to indulge it) and on to the more difficult aspects of life in 1946 England: orphaned children making the best of new circumstances, the sweeping away of old certainties as the shellshocked population waits to see if something better or worse will rise from the rubble, the pride and sorrow attached to war heroes and those who had to care for the injured ones when they came home. Bookish delivers a ripping yarn, yes, but grief and melancholy undercut it at many turns.Alongside the self-contained plot, we have the slower burn of what precisely is going on in Book’s life. He is married to Trottie (Polly Walker) and they clearly love each other dearly but sleep apart. They have recruited a young man to help in the shop while Gabriel sleuths. Jack (Connor Finch) is an orphan with no memories of his mother and only a single picture of his father, fresh out of a two-year stint in prison for his part as the getaway driver in a smash-and-grab raid in Mayfair. There are signs that the Books have taken him under their wing for motives other than altruism. There are also (God, Walker remains such a magnificent danger) signs that Mrs Book may have a taste for younger men which, if they come to fruition, will require a subcategory of cosy crime to be hastily instituted so we’ll need to keep an eye on that.I don’t think it counts as a spoiler to say that one gently unspooling thread of Bookish is an exploration of Book’s life as a necessarily closeted gay man. It adds to the sense of sorrow that infuses the series and gives it heft, and warms the edges of Book as a character and of Gatiss – customarily quite a closed and chilly actor – to a valuable degree.There are a few tricky moments – I’m not sure I buy an opportunistic theft by a man who just happens to be carrying around a jade chess set, or why he would leave a piece behind as an entirely unconvincing substitute for a stolen figurine. I feel, too, that we could do with finding some way other than battles about apostrophe placement to demonstrate a character’s intellectual superiority. But overall Bookish is a fine piece of entertainment – meticulously worked, beautifully paced and decidedly moreish. (It was commissioned for a second series before the first began.) It has enough spikiness to stop it being formulaic but enough love for the genre to keep it comforting.

But there is little to no music in this laborious slice of content, one of the many frustrating and disconcerting things about it. And for me, this film shows yet again that there is something about the Smurfs, those little Belgian creatures with blue skin and floppy-protuberant hats, which is basically kryptonite to comedy and entertainment.The script by Pam Brady (justly respected for her work on South Park andTeam America: World Police) follows the template of being pretty bland for the sweet Smurfs themselves, but is sharpened up with one or two properly funny lines for the all-too-brief scenes featuring the evil wizard characters Razamel and Gargamel (both voiced by JP Karliak) whom the Smurfs are up against.In the Smurfs’ home village, the one depressed Smurf is No Name Smurf (voiced by James Corden), who feels he has no real attribute or quality that marks him out. But then he discovers that he in fact has cosmic and magical powers, which are to come in vitally handy when the evil wizards kidnap Papa Smurf (John Goodman), intent on purloining a certain magic book secretly in his possession which would allow them, in concert with other wicked beings, to control the universe.This very uninteresting and uninspired story plods along for an hour and a half, though there are some almost-interesting surreal scenes when our heroes find themselves in weird alt-universe dimensions. There are also some decent gags featuring Sound Effect Smurf, who communicates in sound effects. But there seems to be a worrying assumption here that a film aimed at very little kids doesn’t need to have a very interesting or engaging story.Smurfs is out now in Australia, and on 18 July in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFamily filmsRihannaJames CordenJohn GoodmanreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is a shaggy dog tale of ineffable silliness, operating ostensibly on the realist lines of indie US cinema but sauntering sideways from its initial premise, getting further and further from what had appeared to be a real issue: how difficult it is for grown men to make new friends.In this case, a beta-male chump attempts to be mates with his supercool new neighbour and you might even suspect that the film’s progressive excursion into stoner unseriousness itself enacts men’s avoidant nature, their inability to find an emotionally intelligent connection with each other. The result is not unlike the darkly wacky entertainments ofJim HoskingorTodd Solondz; there’s also a tiny hint ofCharlie Kaufmanand the white-collar-workplace losers of Ricky Gervais and Steve Carell.‘A case study on psychosis’: men on why Tim Robinson’s Friendship feels a little too realRead moreIn a bland suburban close, Craig (Robinson) is a dull but well-meaning guy working in corporate PR consultancy, whose elegant wife Tami (Kate Mara) runs a flower delivery business from the house. She is in remission from cancer, and Craig has patently no clue how to deal with this. At a support group for people with cancer and their partners, Craig beamingly assures her in front of everyone present that there’s no way the cancer is coming back, in a wince-makingly misjudged attempt at emotional strength. Now Tami is openly reconnecting with an old flame, in the face of which Craig is as uncomprehending and unjudging as the family dog.It is at this moment that Craig runs into Austin (Paul Rudd), the stylish guy who lives next door; he is a minor celebrity, plays in a local band and is a weatherman on the regional TV news. (This is in slight contrast to his character in Anchorman, field reporter Brian Fantana; Steve Carell’s Brick was the weatherman.) Craig is stunned by Austin’s worldly sophistication and laid-back charm, and Austin is touched by Craig’s heartbreaking vulnerability; he welcomes Craig into his circle of male friends for a “hang”. Over-excited Craig embarrassingly goes too far and annoys Austin, but discovers a secret that means that Austin can never entirely break up with him as a friend.Until Craig’s terrible faux pas with Austin, which he (horrifyingly) attempts to style out by literally eating soap and goofily intoning “sorry”, it’s possible to read Friendship as a plausible, if far-detached character study, a cringe-comedy Single White Male heading for disaster. Then it swerves away, following its nose towards something weirder, with an amusing setpiece featuring Craig licking a toad in search of psychedelic thrills and experiencing only a minute-long hallucination of outrageous banality. For some, that will be tiresome; and it’s certainly the case that the female characters are under-imagined (Austin’s wife hardly exists at all). But male inadequacy is the point; the loopy absurdism grows on you.Friendship is in UK and Irish cinemas from 18 July, and Australian cinemas from 17 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter Bradshaw's film of the weekComedy filmsPaul RuddKate MaraMen (Society)Men (Life and style)ComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Transmitting those advances to a wider public, while reminding specialists whom they really work for, is a rare craft. For the past half century,Brian Fagan, who has died aged 88, did that through his writing and speaking, shaping public understanding of ancient human history.UnlikeCarl SaganorDavid Attenborough, who brought cosmology and nature into millions of homes, Brian never fronted a television series. But his well-researched output was prodigious: including revised editions, he wrote or edited the equivalent of two books for every year of his life.Nine textbooks covering world prehistory and the practice of archaeology have been through a total of 83 revisions, most in recent years co-authored with theBritish editor and archaeologist Nadia Durrani.Books for a wider readership range in subject from human origins and the early Americas to the search for Tutankhamun. His first, The Rape of the Nile: Tomb Robbers, Tourists, and Archaeologists in Egypt (1975), won aCaliforniabook award gold medal. The Great Warming: Climate Change and the Rise and Fall of Civilizations (2008) was his New York Times bestseller, and Climate Chaos: Lessons on Survival from Our Ancestors (2021, with Durrani) won Italy’s Cosmos award for popular science writing.It is an immense challenge to bring the ancient past to proper life, informed by no more than broken remains and highly technical science. Brian’s approach was to focus on the human and the global, throwing in contemporary references – notably in a number ofbooks that dealt with climate change and rising sea levels– and fictional vignettes.A millennia ago in California, “Flickering hearths and blazing firebrands highlight dark windows and doorways on the terrace of the great house that is Pueblo Bonito.” Describing two stoneworkers in 7000BC Belgium “camped in a sandy clearing”, he noted that one of them was left-handed, before explaining how that observation was obtained. His first rule of writing: “Always tell a story.”Like Sagan, Brian was a university professor with his own research experiences. Born in Birmingham, he was adopted at birth by Margaret (nee Moir) and Brian Fagan. His father was a president of the Publishers’ Association who worked in partnership with Edward Arnold, founder of Edward Arnold & Co, where he was responsible for school books and the university arts list. His grandfather, Patrick Fagan, was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic, Royal Astronomical and Royal Historical Societies. Brian was himself an honorary fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He was later to learn that his birth mother was a teacher.Like his father, he went to Rugby school. He did national service with the Royal Navy, before studying archaeology and anthropology at Pembroke College, Cambridge (1956–59).He then completed his Cambridge MA and PhD in Africa (1959-65), principally when keeper of prehistory at the Livingstone Museum, Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia), and conducting archaeological fieldwork in that country and Kenya. In 1960 he had a short stint lecturing at the University of Cape Town, South Africa (he returned there as a visiting professor in 1982).He decided early on that his forte lay in teaching and popular writing, not primary research; he left Africa, he said, exhausted by the logistics of excavation and survey, and as “a sound, but second-rate excavator”.He had thought of joining the family publishing business. When offered a visiting position at the University of Illinois, Urbana, however, he happened to lunch with Mortimer Wheeler, then a powerful archaeologist and media star. Wheeler advised him to write about archaeology for the public, saying, “We need a new voice.” Brian spent a year at Urbana before moving to the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB).Newly faced in 1967 with a class of 300 introductory anthropology students, and no books to support his teaching, he set about filling the gap. Within seven years he had published two introductory readers, and two textbooks: In the Beginning: An Introduction toArchaeology(of which a 15th edition was published this year), and Men of the Earth: An Introduction to World Prehistory (currently, as People of the Earth, in its 16th edition).Told he could teach “anything I liked”, it was nonetheless a difficult time. Two influential and charismatic archaeologists,Lewis Binfordand James Deetz, had left the department just as he arrived. That year,Ronald Reaganhad begun his first term as governor of California, on a mission to stamp out campus protest (UCSB was notorious for its anti-Vietnam war activity, and in 1969 a caretaker was killed by a bomb), cut university spending, and bend curriculums towards conservative thinking. The anthropology department, Brian said, was “reeling from the impact”.Nevertheless, unperturbed, and gifted with confidence, drive and vision, Brian stayed at UCSB, writing one book after another. He retired in 2003 as professor emeritus of anthropology.The Archaeological Institute of Americarecognised his books with a lifetime achievement award, and the Society for American Archaeology awarded him three times, for his public writing and media work, and his book Before California (2003).Beside books and teaching (in which he was an early adopter of new technologies, encouraging his students to think freely), Brian busied himself widely as university dean (various posts 1970–76), consultant (for the likes of the National Geographic Society, Time/Life, Microsoft and the BBC), magazine columnist and editorial adviser. He would have liked to have presented TV films, he once told me (though he claimed not to watch any), but that call never came. He was an impressive and charismatic speaker, however, in more recent years teasing his audiences with humour, and with the presence of an ageing Shakespearean actor who was fit enough to bicycle 100 miles a week into his 80s.Occasions ranged from Munro lecturer at the University of Edinburgh (1967), through to guest speaker at Flinders University Museum of Art (2014) – and many more. Other awards included recognition for his teaching, and the Cruising Association’s Hanson Cup (he once crossed the Atlantic in his own boat). As a keen sailor he enjoyed California’s coastal waters (and, naturally, published well-received cruising guides). He was working on new book editions, and a new title, when he died.His first marriage, to Judith Fontana, ended in divorce. He married Lesley Newhart in 1985, and she survives him, as do their daughter, Anastasia, and his daughter with Judith, Lindsay.Brian Murray Fagan, archaeologist and writer, born 1 August 1936; died 1 July 2025Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyScience (Education)CaliforniaHistory booksobituariesShareReuse this content"

Amid an already bumper year of literary wins for Black authors, with the Sudanese writerLeila Aboulela’s Pen Pinter prizeamong the most recent, there is no better time to beef up your summer reading list. In this week’s newsletter, I’ll talk you through some of my favourite page-turners – from a romcom about old flames to stories about queer life in Nigeria and a debut coming-of-age novel about class, affluence and grief.Your summer reading list starts hereView image in fullscreenThe ultimate six-pack … our top reads.Composite: Guardian PicturesSweet Heat by Bolu BabalolaBolu Babalola has become one of theforemost romcom writers– her short story collection Love in Colour was a bestseller and her debut novel, Honey & Spice, was picked for Reese Witherspoon’s book club. Honey & Spice charted the fake-to-real romance of university students Malakai and Kiki. Now, the much anticipated follow-up, Sweet Heat, picks up three years after their explosive breakup, as Kiki finds that her ex is to be the best man at a wedding at which she is the maid of honour. Babalola expertly captures the frustration and tension that emerges when we encounter old flames, and asks us to consider how love can be equally transformative and disruptive. It’s exactly the kind of book you need this summer.Sweet Heat is published by Headline Review (£18.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply.Great Black Hope by Rob FranklinThis debut novel centres on Smith, a young Black gay man who has been raised in a bourgeois family in Atlanta, and who is looking to escape his grief after discovering the body of his roommate, who had overdosed. Returning to Atlanta, the expectations of his family – a cabal of doctors and lawyers – only deepen his despair, and he soon finds himself again drawn once again to the tragic and glamorous New York underworld that claimed his friend’s life. This book is a timely examination of the limits to which class can insulate Black people, and an antidote to respectability politics. Franklin was the son of an HBCU president during the Obama era, and it appears that he has gone through a significant journey while grappling with the pitfalls of affluence and shedding the false promises of exceptionalism.Great Black Hope is published by Simon & Schuster (£16.99).Order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.Absence by Issa QuincyIn Quincy’s novel, the narrator is charmed by a poem first read to him as a child by his mother, which then follows him through his life. He’s stirred by memories and emotions as he is confronted by letters and photographs, phantoms and secrets, all of which make up a life that has been affected by generations of profound familial tragedy. Quincy’s prose is deftly lyrical and imaginative; I’ve had the pleasure of hearing him read from Absence at a literary salon in London and it was entrancing. He observes the fragility of memory, and what remains after our encounters, however fleeting, with people, say a schoolteacher or an estranged aunt; you might think of him as a counterpart to the novelists Rachel Cusk and Teju Cole.Absence is published by Granta Books (£14.99).Order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.View image in fullscreenFun in the sun … read yourself happy this summer.Photograph: Martin Lee/Rex FeaturesNecessary Fiction by Eloghosa OsundeI loved Osunde’s bookVagabonds!, so I am excited to get stuck into Necessary Fiction, which explores cross-generational queer life in Nigeria. The action is set in Lagos, a dynamic but chaotic 24-hour city, and against this buzzing backdrop Osunde’s characters balance their sexuality and the demands of their lives: negotiating relationships with their parents, building chosen families, embracing and risking romance, and considering desire, death and religion. Lagos is a repository of dreams and aspirations that are often beaten down by the difficulties of the city – yet art, music and creativity have helped define it beyond the mismanagement and corruption it has suffered. “Necessary fiction” is what Osunde’s Lagosians must carry with them for survival. I look forward to getting to know them – and their stories.Necessary Fiction is published by Harper Collins (£16.99) on 31 July.Order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.The Catch by Yrsa Daley-WardThis hotly anticipated novel by the eminent writer and poet has been described as “dark and lyrical” by the author Yomi Adegoke. You can certainly glean that from the synopsis. Twin sisters Clara and Dempsey became estranged after their mother vanished into the River Thames. But when, as adults, they notice a woman called Serene, who looks exactly like their mother at the time of her disappearance, their lives are thrown into confusion. Is Serene their mother? The originality of the plot is compelling, and so is Daley-Ward’s exploration of familial absence and estrangement.The Catch is published by Cornerstone (£16.99).

A romance develops during the summer when the unnamed narrator visits the Blake family in the south of France, but when they return to London, they are assailed by race and class tensions. Both men are haunted by past traumas, and the narrator also faces the sisyphean task of trying to fit into the Blake’s world. In Sunstruck, Notting Hill in London is depicted as a site of great privilege and wealth (the Blake family’s residence is there) and also a place where Caribbean culture is celebrated at the Notting Hill carnival.Sunstruck is published by Cornerstone (£16.99).Order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsBooksThe Long WaveFictionShort storiesAfricaCaribbeanRacenewslettersShareReuse this content"

It’s a place exposed to “the raw death of the endless future, which at night in the midwest in winter is sometimes bare inches above the roofs”. Just as frightening is Nicholas’s sense that “anything can come in”. One day in January, what comes into Nicholas is the god Pan – a possessing, deranging, life-threatening spirit. Or that, anyhow, is how Nicholas comes to interpret his increasingly disabling anxiety.Pan is remarkable for the honesty of its treatment of both mental illness and adolescence. It shows more successfully than any other book I’ve read how these can be experienced as black magic – indeed, it allows that they might be black magic. Nicholas successfully prophesies trivial events (the wind rising, someone saying the word “diabetes”) and is haunted by a dead mouse’s squeak. Another boy finds a means of divination in a schlock fantasy novel. Even the pop anthem More Than a Feeling is a path to the uncanny; it’s a song with “a door in the middle of it … like the door on a UFO”. Nicholas becomes convinced that he is perpetually at risk of leaving his body – specifically, that his “looking/thinking could pour or leap out” of his head – and his friends, also being 15 years old, are ready to believe it, too. They are easy prey for Ian, a college-age man who sets himself up as a small-time cult leader among these high-school kids. Ian particularly targets Nicholas, telling him that only they are capable of real thoughts; the others in the group are “Hollows” who have “Solid Mind”, a deterministic mentality with no animating self. “The sound of words from a Hollow mouth,” says Ian, “contains an abyss.” Soon the group is staging rituals incorporating sex, drugs and animal sacrifice.Anyone who has experienced mental illness – and many who have just been 15 years old – will find Pan uncannily familiarMeanwhile, Nicholas loses his ability to sleep and spirals toward psychosis. Clune is brilliant on the loss of control and exaggeration of terror that follows. Falling out of your face can be transcendence, but can also represent extinction. When Nicholas sees a black-and-white photograph of a group of long-dead priests, he reflects: “Now they’d all stepped out of their faces … The faces hung there like rows of empty sneakers in a shop window. The priests had stepped out.” At his hardware-store job, Nicholas sees the racks of garden tools and realises, “These are animals too … These are the husks, the waiting bodies, the body traps of animals.” He knows that if he stares at the hand spades and rotary tillers long enough, he can inhabit them; even household objects now have a door in the middle of them. Nicholas’s reality becomes fluid. Among his friends, he becomes the object of semi‑religious, semi-voyeuristic fascination. What is truly remarkable here is that the extravagance feels meticulously true to a certain state of altered consciousness. I doubt that anyone has had Nicholas’s exact experiences, or even ones that resemble them in obvious ways. Still, anyone who has experienced mental illness – and many who have just been 15 years old – will find even Clune’s most phantasmagoric pages uncannily familiar.There are trade-offs to fiction that strives to be honest. Here, one is that the other characters never fully become people. They’re external experiences that inform the way Nicholas relates to his own mind, and it’s often very credible that they are “Hollows” with no real consciousness. This may be a truthful depiction of the isolation characteristic of extreme mental states. It also means the story is unrelentingly solipsistic. The plot centres on inner epiphanies. While these present themselves as life-saving answers, they all turn out to be brief respites, some evanescing so quickly that they’re forgotten seconds later. It’s no surprise that Sisyphus appears as a reference here. This is certainly true both of coping with mental illness and surviving adolescence. It also risks making the reader feel as if we’re going nowhere.But this is not really to criticise the book: it’s just to say what it is and isn’t. A reader who approaches Pan expecting the usual rewards of a coming-of-age story will be sorely disappointed. It offers not answers but visions; not growth but lambent revelation; not closure but openings. “Good writing,” Nicholas tells us, is “the careful, painstaking replacement of each part of this world with a part that [looks] the same, but [is] deeper, more mysterious, richer.” This feels like a fair description of Clune’s own process, with the proviso that he is not replacing but supplementing; not substituting for reality, but adding to it. Nicholas ends his inner journey without arriving at the cure he has been pursuing. But when we close the book, we find ourselves in a larger world.Pan by Michael Clune is published by Fern Press (£16.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

As Nintendo’s first major single-player Switch 2 game, it will set the quality bar for the console in the way Breath of the Wild did when the original Switch was released. But as the latest game from the team responsible for the exceptional 3D Mario series, it is already begrudged by someNintendofans as a distraction: what could possibly be so exciting about a tie-wearing gorilla to justify making Bananza ahead of another Super Mario Odyssey?Donkey Kong demolishes those concerns. He demolishes a lot in Bananza. It may resemble a Mario 64-style 3D platformer on the surface, with its themed worlds festooned with giant bananas to sniff out and collect, but DK’s fists show total disregard for the playground as built. All terrain is destructible. Mash the buttons and his powerful arms thump tunnels through hills, pound pristine lawns into muddy craters and tear up wodges of stone to swing as sledgehammers for even speedier landscaping. He is less a platforming mascot than a potassium-powered level editor.View image in fullscreenRepeatable joy … Donkey Kong Bananza.Photograph: NintendoOn a primal level, that’s almost enough to hold your attention. There’s an easy, repeatable joy in throwing a punch this well programmed: the jolt of pause as knuckles collide with rock, the snarl of Joy-Con 2 rumble, the way surfaces splinter before another hit brings down the entire wall. I can see Bananza having a second life as an executive stress reliever; a virtual rage room where you heave exploding boulders at cliffs to reduce them to pockmarked swiss cheese. You can even invite a co-op pal along to shoot projectiles from DK’s back and accelerate the chaos (or act as a devilish tag along to a player trying to avoid any carnage).There is motivation behind the mayhem. The existing Kong clan (getting some choice cameos that channel the comic spirit of Rare’s Donkey Kong Country games) is expanded by villainous mining Kongs set on snagging a treasure at the planet’s core. En route they kidnap Pauline, the young singer whom Donkey Kong originally snatched in his arcade debut. But Kong and Pauline are on better terms here: she coaxes animal superpowers by belting out powerful earworms straight into his skull. If my plot recollection seems hazy, it’s only because it’s been supplanted in my mind by her Latin pop ditty about the joy of being a zebra.View image in fullscreenA  strange world … Donkey Kong Bananza.Photograph: NintendoThis is a strange world but an even stranger platforming proposition. How do you design obstacles for a hero who can tunnel under laser fences or jackhammer doorways through barriers that would have stopped Mario in his tracks? Truthfully, it takes a beat to find the answers. There is an initial mushiness to worlds that can be excavated from any angle. Sometimes you blindly mine into rewards intended for challenges you have not yet uncovered or parsed, and the haphazardness of these unearned prizes has you wondering, for a second, if the game’s freeform audacity rings as hollow as the caves you’re punching into existence.But no. Later, rolling plains and jaunty lagoons make way for more dangerous landscapes, where solid ground protects you from poison swamps, icy lakes and lava. Down here, land is life, so your treatment of it becomes more deliberate, your strikes more surgical. When metal caterpillars gobble a wooden life raft or a pogoing menace punches through a platform you tenderised into a thin sliver, you suddenly appreciate the method in Nintendo’s morphable madness. Boss fights make exceptional use of fragile terrain, keeping DK from walloping chunks from their giant bodies by rendering arenas more and more uneven as fights unfold.The only fumble in these later stages is the overpowered nature of the Bananzas themselves. These animal transformations imbue DK with speed, flight, strength and more, and when contained in the challenges or levels built for them they sing. You are reminded of Mario’s Odyssey possessions and how perfectly realised each of those physical sensations was. But taken out of that context – when returning to earlier stages to mop up collectibles, for example – they become instant win buttons, dulling the ingenuity of Nintendo’s platforming designs.I’m not sure Bananza has the same legs as Mario Odyssey. Where that game blossomed in a rich, post-credit endgame, DK lives more in the moment: moving ever forward, chewing through new ideas and never stopping to pulverise the roses. Come the game’s epic climax, he has smashed through concrete, rubber, watermelon, ostrich eggs, entire Donkey Kong Country homages, glitter balls – even the NPCs he’s trying to protect. If the weight of Switch 2 does lie on his shoulders, that’s just one more tool to bash a hole in the universe. His appetite for destruction is infectious.Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendoNintendo Switch 2Platform gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Reader, she has now put that phase behind her. I Am a Strange Gloop finds our host staggering shell-shocked from the soft play area to the stage, with battle-hardened tales to tell from motherhood’s frontline. Ruthlessly banished from the centre of her own life, she now endures an existence “that makes The Handmaid’s Tale look progressive”, cleaning up after infant sons, fielding their erratic poos, playing receptacle and canvas for vomit and passing toilet brushes.All that is amusing if familiar. So, too, her material on her manchild husband, which – coming from an act who once laid siege to gender essentialism – cleaves surprisingly to stereotype. Where our host gets sharper is in the philosophical dimension she gives this new chapter of life, conjuring with a sense of self so undermined by becoming a mum, and by shouldering adult responsibilities, that she’s not sure what’s left of prior-Pascoe – see one terrific joke about escaping, like her two kids did before her, from her own body.Sara Pascoe: ‘I still identify as an infertile, childless woman’Read moreThere are other ways to cheat biology, of course: the show’s second recurring subject is the transhumanist fantasy of remaining forever young. There’s also a counterintuitive section on AI porn, and a story about meetingRobbie Williamsthat brings middle-aged Sara into contact with the teenage Take That fan she used to be.This may not add up to as tight or conceptually rich a show as the 44-year-old has delivered in years gone by. Her closing set-piece, a new chapter she’s written to add to the Bible, is apropos of nothing that precedes it. But she delivers some fine material – about Sisyphus, revolting against capitalism, and an excellent running joke (in more ways than one) aboutPaula Radcliffe– even if doesn’t unite into a coherent whole. Forever young? That’s not happening. Forever interesting? Without a doubt.Touring until 29 MarchExplore more on these topicsComedySara PascoeParents and parentingPaula RadcliffeRobbie WilliamsreviewsShareReuse this content"

He’s super alive and in the moment. Everything about it is energising, masculine, powerful’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 16 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareI’m not a cowboy and I don’t ride horses, but I’ve been around them my whole life. My dad had a furniture store near the stockyards in south Omaha, and I would watch the cattle being moved between pens ready to go to auction. I sensed a freedom in the cowboys that I related to. I’ve always been an explorer, it’s my nature. I’m more comfortable and I feel most alive in situations I’m not familiar with. I am always drawn to this same type – I’ve photographed test pilots and astronauts – the strong, quiet, self-directed types who seem to be in control of their destiny.This shot of Mark, a friend of mine, was taken in 2014. All my images are productions, I don’t just happen to be there. I build a narrative and visit locations – it’s more like making a movie, it’s very intentional. I scout locations that connect to what I want to represent. This was a rugged area of northern Colorado. The shoot was really about speed and energy, and I wanted open spaces that could allow the cowboys to do what they wanted. I wanted harder surfaces and dramatic skies – although you never really know what you’re going to get. I take references from historical paintings and drawings of the American west, and ideas I carry on pieces of paper, so I go with a visual feel of what I want to do. I wanted to separate the colours of the landscape: the colour of the hat, the horse, its saddle blanket, were all selected deliberately. The image is all about power and grace – the gesture of the animal is so forceful, and the cowboy is so in control.I looked up Ansel Adams in the phone book and called him. And that was the start of me studying with Ansel AdamsWhen I look at this photograph I want to be that guy. He’s super alive and in the moment, there’s the feeling of an adrenaline rush – everything about it is energising, masculine, powerful – and it underlines the theme of freedom. It gives you a feeling of life. When I look back, a lot of my work is about the same thing. It’s not so much about cowboys, it’s about the freedom to express yourself. I hope it makes people feel good – it makes me feel empowered. The cowboy, like the Statue of Liberty or the Hollywood sign, is a symbol of America, it conveys some kind of hope, something aspirational.Giddy up! Photos from the wild frontier – in picturesRead moreWhen Richard Prince appropriated my work in 2007, it was a real catalyst to redefine myself. In the last 10 years, that’s given me the freedom to express what I think about the American west in new ways, such as in my paintings. I don’t have an agenda, I am always on the move physically and conceptually with my work. It was violating to have my image taken – but it did bring my work to light. It was afterthe New York Times articlethatJames Danzingerbegan to represent me.I used to watch my maternal grandfather paint every Saturday. He was an abstract expressionist and his use of colour was very unusual. After he had a stroke, Saturdays with him ended but he gave me my first camera and instructed me to use it. One day he told me he had been reading about someone he thought I should study with –Ansel Adams. I looked him up in the phone book and called – and that was the start of me studying and working with Adams in California.Nowadays, people don’t look that much at what’s around them. It’s a very angst-ridden environment, it’s hard to separate ourselves from the emotional rollercoaster. I don’t bury my head in the sand but my work is a way for me to escape. It’s the only way I can get away from all this shit that’s going on on a daily basis, and make something beautiful that inspires me. If you keep your eyes open, there’s just so much out there.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Jim KrantzJim Krantz’s CVBorn:Omaha, Nebraska, 1955Trained:“I am still in training, and plan to continue.”Influences:“The natural world and my maternal grandfather.”High point:“Mt Wilson, near Telluride at 13,800ft – photographing for the US army. The high points in a career often get the most attention, but it’s the low points that have taught me the most. Those are the moments when feelings run deepest, when you’re most aware, and when growth truly begins. It’s from those uncertain places that you rebuild – and that’s where the real expansion and improvement happen. But I don’t tend to emphasise either high or low too heavily, because a creative life is made of constant ebb and flow. That movement, that rhythm, is what keeps the work alive and evolving.”Low point:“Cancún, Mexico 34ft below sea level – diving. The title Frontier holds deep meaning for me. It speaks to the space between the known and the unknown – the edge where the familiar falls away and something new begins. That’s the place I’m drawn to most. When I’m a bit lost, a bit unsure … that’s where the real work begins. Some might call it a low point. For me, it’s where I feel most alive.”Top tip:“Free yourself from self judgment – just work.”Frontier by Jim Krantz is published byGOST BooksExplore more on these topicsArt and designMy best shotPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was raised on a diet of sketch shows (French and Saunders, Mitchell and Webb, Monty Python) and took any opportunity I could to be silly for an audience. I have a vivid memory of a very elaborate performance of We Three Kings for the Year 5 talent show (“sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, DYING!”) – I won. I’m drawn to big, playful characters – wigs, costumes, silly voices. At uni I started doing sketch comedy and never really stopped.How would you describe what you do?Gentle absurdity. It’s a silly good-natured sending up of recognisable things. In my last show, I brought to life a series of inanimate objects – including an annoying Californian paper straw, a pathetic electric scooter desperate to be unlocked, and an incredibly anxious, sensitive smoke alarm. My new hour merges this kind of absurd character comedy with drag. I’m pretending to be a middle-aged cycling man, complete with Lycra bulges, devastating divorce, outrageous income and zero emotional intelligence.Whatinspiredthe show?I used to cycle to work through central London, wearing jeans like a normal person, and I’d be overtaken by these guys all kitted out in the gear and I would just think to myself … surely,surelythey cannot be cycling much further than me. Where are they going? From their central London flat to their slightly more central London office? Why won’t they put their feet down at the traffic lights? Are they OK?Around a similar time, I became aware of drag kings as an art form (like drag queens, but performing heightened masculinity instead). I was so energised, inspired and amazed watching the iconic drag king collective Pecs and the Man Up! competition. It’s such an exciting, varied, DIY, punky art form and I started to wonder if I had a drag king character in me. The two ideas combined, and The Cycling Man was born …View image in fullscreen‘Try and fail!’ … Kathy Maniura.Photograph: Akta PhotographyWhat’s been one of your all-time favourite gigs?Sometimes the weird gigs are the most unexpectedly fun. Last summer I did a spot at a small festival. I was with some brilliant comedians (Rosalie Minnitt, Lorna Rose Treen and Emily Bampton). We turned up and the person on the stage before us was giving a very earnest presentation about his research into arctic foxes. Getting into drag in the cold backstage area of the tent listening to the lecture I thought, ah – they may not be in the mood for absurd character comedy after this. How wrong I was! The audience were wonderful, and all the more wonderful for defying our expectations. That’s a pro and con of the job – you never know quite what you’re going to get until you turn up for a show.Can you recall a gig so bad, it’s now funny?When I was doing a show with my comedy partner Derek Mitchell, we booked a spot at one of the stages on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. It’s the main flyering thoroughfare during the fringe and there’s an open-air stage for acts to perform a snippet of their show. Lovely, in theory. Except what does well on that stage is juggling and a cappella singing, not alternative sketch comedy. I performed a solo piece – a wordy parody song. It was raining. The small crowd quickly dispersed. Derek laughed his head off as the light left my eyes while I continued to perform. There were two other people watching under an umbrella – my parents.Any bugbears from the world of comedy?There’s still a lot of unpaid and poorly paid gigs, many of which you travel for and, while the Edinburgh fringe itself is still seen as a rite of passage, it’s becoming prohibitively expensive. Many working-class comedians can’t do it. A lot of comedy spaces are inaccessible in other ways – male dominated, all white, in basements or upstairs in old pubs. It puts comedians in marginalised groups at a huge disadvantage in an industry that’s already hard work.Worst advice you’ve ever been given?A prospective agent once said to me that if you have a day job you like, you’re a “hobbyist”. Actually, creative work doesn’t have to be torture, and I think the idea that creative brilliance is born of hardship and that you have to give up everything to pursue your dreams is actually pretty toxic. That person did not become my agent!What’s an important lesson you’ve learned from being a standup?To try and fail! The only way you get better at comedy is by saying a joke out loud, in front of people, and seeing what happens. Once you’ve bombed a decent number of times, you learn that dying doesn’t actually meandying.Kathy Maniura: The Cycling Man is atPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, 30 July-24 AugustExplore more on these topicsComedyComedy Q&AEdinburgh festivalEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreTV comedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They share their top tips, from ‘eating the frog’ to drawing up a ‘ta-da’ listSarah PhillipsWed 16 Jul 2025 06.10 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 06.12 EDTShareSome of us are utterly hopeless with admin, others so good they do it for a living. What are the best ways to get your working life under control? Administrators share their productivity tips and efficiency hacks.Plan your day …“First thing in the morning, I spend half an hour going through emails and making a plan for the day,” says Claudine Hopgood, an administrator for the heads of product planning and network sales at Volkswagen Group UK in Milton Keynes. “You can never schedule 100% of your day; I schedule 80%, and the other 20% is to allow for unforeseen interruptions.”View image in fullscreenStart the day with a plan.Photograph: Posed by model; Maria Korneeva/Getty Images… and your week“Have a good overview of your week,” says Suzanne Ekpenyong, the lead virtual assistant ofan agency of VAsthat she runs from Woodford, east London. “Check your availability and whether it works for you. Do you have enough desk time? Are you travelling too much? Does it work around your personal life? What is your energy going to be like that week? I think everybody should get into the habit of looking at their diary from an energy perspective and seeing if there is enough balance there.”Get the most difficult task out of the way first“I eat the frog first,” says Hopgood, referring to motivational speaker Brian Tracy’s theory that you should start the day with your most tedious task to get it out of the way. “Procrastination is king. If you continually put off the three tasks you have to get done, you know they’re not going to get done. So get them done first and get the dopamine hit afterward.”Maximise your calendar notifications“Make sure you have notifications set up on your diary system,” says Ekpenyong. “Google or Outlook might give a notification 15 minutes before something starts but, when you set up the meeting or appointment, it is useful to put in a notification three days before, two days before, and so on, so that you’re on top of your preparation. This helps you to not stress at the last minute.”Craig Bryson agrees. The executive assistant at a private equity company in Mayfair, who hosts apodcastfor administrators, says: “I use my mobile calendar to remember birthdays and anniversaries – I have 46 cousins, so I need to be on top of that. I always hear the comment, ‘Oh, you’re a man – are you able to multitask?’”Abide by the four Ds“This is great for culling your inbox,” says Ekpenyong. The Ds stand for do, defer, delegate and delete. “Dowhat you need to do in the moment;deferit until later, so it might go on your to-do list at that point;delegateit to someone else – that’s amazing because then they can crack on with it; and the most wonderful thing isdeletingthings that you don’t need, you’ve already done, that are no longer relevant – they can go straight in the bin.”Aspire to inbox zero – but don’t obsess“I’m motivated by the challenge and excitement of thinking, ‘Today’s the day I’ll reach inbox zero’,” says Bryson. “I never do, but I think it’s about the passion of trying.”“Inbox zero is just the best way of working,” says Jess Branch from St Albans, personal assistant to Simon Allford, architect and co-founder of Allford Hall Monaghan Morris. “Especially working with my jobshare, Georgia. We use it as a very clear gauge when we are trying to work out our workload. We categorise all our emails: red is an email that needs to be actioned, green is an email that is waiting on a reply. So it is basically using your inbox as a to-do list and just constantly trying to get it down so you feel ahead of the game.”Have a priority to-do list“I’m a big list-maker,” says Ekpenyong. “I use theAsanaapp, a project- and task-management system. But sometimes it is quicker just to grab a pen and pad and write down your three top priorities because sometimes, when you’re really busy, it’s really easy to think, ‘I can’t cope.’ That is why I swear by a ‘must-do’ list, which is different from my to-do list. These are the things you know are very critical and must absolutely happen that day. Anything else is a bonus.”She also recommends keeping a “ta-da list” of everything you have completed: “It gives you a great sense of achievement, which is often what you need to keep going with the rest of your to-do.”Always make notes“The Notes app on my phone is my saviour,” says Shanice Robertson, a virtual assistant based in Aberdeen. “I’ve tried a few apps but honestly, between my notebook and the Notes app on my phone, I think old-school is the best way.”Hopgood adds: “I have a 3am brain-dump notebook by the bed of just random things.” At work, she has a pen on her lanyard for “when you’re on the fly, you’re going to a meeting and somebody stops you. I’ve always got a small notebook with me that fits in my pocket so I can quickly scribble something down.”“Always write it down,” agrees Bryson. When the executive he works for calls him in, he grabs a pad, “because, by the time you get back to your desk, you’ve probably forgotten exactly what you got asked to do that is important. Your brain is more for ideas and not storage.”Find ways for AI to help you“I use AI to tell me to do stuff,” says Branch. “When I make my packed lunch for the next day, I will say, ‘Alexa, set an alarm for 7.20am for me to take my lunch out of the fridge.’ So while I’m running around, getting my girls out of the house, Alexa will say, ‘Don’t forget to take your lunch.’ Sometimes, I will go to [Microsoft’s AI assistant] Copilot, and say, ‘I need to write an email. It needs to include this, this and this. How should I do it?’ And I’ll just put the facts in, and then it will write an eloquent email that would have taken me 10 minutes.”“If you are feeling overwhelmed,” says Robertson, “you couldput into ChatGPT, ‘Tomorrow, I’ve got to do this; can you work out a plan for me? Break it down into 15-minute goals’, and then you’ll feel better about the next day.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can put a document in and, within seconds, you have a really accurate summary that would have taken you two hours. I joke to my boss, ‘You won’t need me any more.’ But we will still need people. It’s about using AI to your advantage.”Pick up the phone“Sometimes I’d rather stick pins in my eyes than fill out another Doodle poll [to agree a time for a meeting],” says Branch. “If I’m dealing with PAs in other companies, it is much easier to just pick up the phone.”Alternatively, send a voice note, says Robertson: “If I’m in the middle of a task and I remember I need to tell a client something, I’ll just quickly do a voice note – you can work away while it’s recording.”Children limiting own smartphone use to manage mental health, survey findsRead moreGive yourself five seconds to stop procrastinatingRobertson is a fan of the American author Mel Robbins’ five-second rule: “She was lying in bed and she’d seen a rocket on TV the night before, shooting into space, so thought, ‘I’m going to count down 54321 and then launch myself like a rocket.’“If I find I’m scrolling on my phone, or if I’m thinking about doing a task, I say to myself ‘54321’ and I just do it.”View image in fullscreenTry putting your phone away.Photograph: Posed by model; elenaleonova/Getty ImagesIf you need to get something done, hide“I love being distracted,” says Hopgood, “so I do this thing called ‘tactical hiding’ where, if I have something that needs to be done, I will leave my desk. I tell one person where I’m going. I go offline, and I put my phone away. There is a really good app calledForestand, if you have a job, you put in an hour and it grows [virtual] trees. If you pick up your phone and go on to Instagram or something, all your trees die. At the end of the week, you can see how many trees you’ve grown.”Own up to mistakesInevitably, even the most organised people sometimes forget things and the admin assistants all agree you have to have some perspective on this. “If you put the wrong link in an email, is somebody still going to be talking about that five years later? No,” says Branch. “Sometimes things do go wrong, and that’s fine, because I’m not perfect.”“Own up to mistakes,” says Hopgood. “Just put your hands up and say, ‘I messed up. I forgot to do that. This is what I’ve done to put it right.’ But just own your mistake. There’s no point trying to cover it up, because you will always be found out.”“There is no such thing as perfection,” says Bryson. “When we make mistakes, we have to think, ‘I will never do it again, because I remember the feeling from that mistake.’ We learn from them, which is a great thing.”Learn when to switch off“When I go on holiday, I delete Teams from my phone,” says Branch. “There is no reason for me to know anything. I care about my job very passionately, but it isn’t life or death.”During the working day, she says, “make sure you’re standing up and moving around, taking a trip to the photocopier or whatever, and taking breaks. Sometimes, if you have loads and loads to do, it feels like the thing you should do is sit at your desk until it’s done. But you need to have a lunch break, and you’ll be so much more productive when you come back.”“You just have to switch off,” says Bryson. “I’ve heard of people taking a month off work as a result of burnout, because they always reach for their mobile just to see whether there are any messages at 8pm. I have a family and a life I want to be able to focus on. You have to create boundaries to help protect your mental health.”Explore more on these topicsTime managementThe expertsHealth & wellbeingMental healthWork-life balancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is because, despite so many being marketed in my direction and so many requests for a column about the best of them, I am consistently grumpy about neck products on principle. I certainly don’t neglect my own neck in my routine, and encourage anyone engaged in their appearance to take good care of theirentireskin, scalp to toe. And I can obviously understand why people seek out a specialist neck treatment when they notice changes in firmness and texture on the throat. But skin doesn’t become different when it passes the jawline, it responds in the same way to TLC as the face, so I can see few good reasons for spending extra money.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The things we know can help produce collagen lost on the face and neck as we age, naturally or prematurely, are retinoids and, to a lesser degree, antioxidants like vitamin C. So I use these on my face and neck (usually at both ends of the day).No fancy product under the anti-ageing umbrella is worth a damn if you’re not applying sunscreen in sufficient quantitiesIf your neck is more sensitive, you could soften the blow by first applying a thin layer of bland moisturiser (like those from Simple, CeraVe or Cetaphil) underneath these punchier actives, or using something better tolerated all over, like Naturium’s well-pricedRetinaldehyde Cream Serum 0.10%(£35 for 50ml). Just apply before nighttime moisturiser and take down to your chest.No fancy product under the “anti-ageing” umbrella is worth a damn if you’re not applying sunscreen in sufficient quantities. You’re almost literally burning your cash. And so I’m saddened by how many people seek neck creams and yet stop applying SPF at their chin.An ultra-light, fluid sunscreen like La Roche Posay’s exceptional newAnthelios UVAir SPF50+(£25 for 40ml), sinks in instantly, so you can do up your shirt without delay or faff.

It can be difficult to recommend skincare such as lip balms because everyone’s skin and preferences are different. But after completing a cosmetic science course, I now know how to analyse cosmetic formulations and ingredient lists like a pro. This helps me tailor my recommendations to different skincare needs. Whether it’s spotting common irritants and allergens, or picking out skincare heroes, I’ve spent the time agonising over ingredient lists so you don’t have to.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I noted how sheer and even the coverage was of any tinted lip balms I tested.’Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianI tested 20 of the most popular lip balms, noting the initial feel and consistency of each one. Throughout the day, I monitored the hydration levels of my lips, recording any plumping or healing effects. I also noted how often each balm needed to be reapplied. Any pilling or uneven application, dryness or irritation were immediate red flags.If a balm was tinted, I noted how sheer and even the coverage was, as well as how easily buildable it was. I also recorded whether each balm was flavoured or scented – this adds to the experience of wearing a lip balm for some, but others may find scents overpowering.An equally important part of my testing involved finding out what consultant dermatologists consider the best ingredients and formulations for different circumstances. I looked for those recommended ingredients in all the balms I tested, picking the best products for each case. A few hours (and a tension headache) later, and I was left with the following selection.As a bonus, I asked the consultants how each lip balm type should be used. You can find their advice below the list of products that came out top in my tests. They also offered their own recommendations, which I included in my testing shortlist.The best lip balms in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianBest lip balm overall:Biossance Pro-Peptide Lip PerfectorView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£9 at Sephora£15 at Space NKPeptides have become more popular in skincare recently – they’re short chains of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) that help stimulate collagen production. In lip care, this helps to achieve smoother lips with fewer fine lines over time. This formula from Biossance is vegan, cruelty-free and perfect for maintaining healthy lips year-round.Why we love itThis lip balm made my lips feel instantly smooth and hydrated from the moment of application. It has quite a thick, non-greasy formula that’s easy to spread using the contoured applicator. Be warned that a little goes a long way: I squeezed out too much the first time and ended up with a smeary mess.Looking closer, its ingredient list is free from irritants and contains what the experts recommend for healthy lips. That includes hydrating humectants, such as glycerin and hyaluronic acid, which draw water deeper into the skin. Since the hyaluronic acid is “micro-encapsulated”, it helps moisture penetrate more effectively. Antioxidant vitamin E and protective occlusives – ingredients that form a barrier to prevent moisture loss – complete the formula. Put simply, it locks hydration in.In my tests, my lips continued to feel smooth and hydrated hours after application, only needing a top-up after meals. I liked that the balm is available in clear and tinted shades. Those hoping to get a wash of colour with their lip care can choose between the rosy Blush Quartz and the deep plum Supernova.It’s a shame that …there’s no SPF in the formula, andit’s lightly scented. I don’t mind the vanilla scent – it made tidying up the mess I made far tastier – but those with sensitive skin may want to choose something unfragranced.Finish:glossySize:15gPrice per g:from 60pVegan:yesCruelty-free:yesFragrance-free:noBest budget lip balm:Vaseline Lip Therapy OriginalView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£2.49 at Superdrug£2.50 at BootsSince Vaseline’s pocket-sized blue and white petroleum jelly tins were released in 1999(with a rainbow of colours launched since), they’ve become a lip-care staple. Three of the four consultant dermatologists I interviewed recommended Vaseline, because of its strong occlusive properties – the formula locks in moisture, helping to naturally and gently repair lips over time.Why we love itIt’s a simple, fragrance-free formula that does exactly what it says on the well-known blue and white tin. It’s affordable and widely available – I’d bet good money on you finding Vaseline at any local pharmacy. And, since it’s made from shelf-stable petroleum, it won’t go off as quickly as other lip balms. Buy one of these and it’ll last for two to three years in your bag.Thanks to its simple formula, it’s also unlikely to cause your lips any irritation. That means it’s perfect at protecting them from cold, dry winds in the winter or for overnight use to lock in hydration.It’s a shame that …they’re so difficult to open. I’m serious: I’ve had so many of these tins get stuck shut over the years, it’s almost insulting to my strength. Also, the balm isn’t hydrating – so if your lips are dry or chapped, opt for the hydrating Aquaphor below.Finish:glossySize:20gPrice perg:from 12pCruelty-free:noVegan:yesFragrance-free:yesBest lip balm for dry lips:Aquaphor Lip RepairView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£5.67 at iHerb£6.47 at AmazonDry, dehydrated lips can be a nightmare to live with, and some lip balms don’t seem to do anything to fix the problem. This hydrating, repairing lip balm from Aquaphor is the perfect solution: it works quickly to rehydrate your lips, ridding them of chapping without irritation. It was widely recommended by the dermatologists I interviewed.Why we love itIt’s packed with hydrating glycerin, wound-healing panthenol, soothing shea butter and bisabolol – a component of chamomile. You’ll also find protective occlusives, which lock in the moisture added by the humectants, in the formula. In essence, it will add moisture to your lips and keep it there, all while soothing inflammation from chapping.The formula feels hydrating and lightweight – perfect for dry, chapped lips, especially in winter. It’s free from endocrine-disrupting and irritating parabens (a type of preservative) and is fragrance-free, so it’s gentle enough to use on sores to nourish lips back to health.It’s a shame that …it’s not vegan, and Aquaphor doesn’t haveLeaping Bunnycruelty-free certification.Finish:glossySize:10mlPrice per ml:from 57pVegan:noCruelty-free:noFragrance-free:yesBest SPF lip balm:Blistex Ultra Lip Balm SPF50+View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£2.20 at Notino£2.75 at Express ChemistSPF lip balms – particularly those with SPF50 protection – tend to look chalky or leave a smeary white cast on the lips. That’s not a look anybody wants to rock. Thankfully, this no-frills lip balm from Blistex offers SPF50+ in a sheer formulation that’s easy to reapply on busy days.Why we love itThis lip balm’s colourless formula comes in a twist-up tube and glides on beautifully, leaving behind a layer of broad-spectrum SPF50+ protection.The balm also contains emollients such as petroleum to help soften the lips while giving the formula a buttery feel. That’s why it feels so nourishing while protecting lips from sun damage.As with any sun protection, reapplication is needed for full coverage. Thankfully, this lip balm has only a subtle vanilla fragrance, making it inoffensive – appealing, even – for everyday use. Since I finished testing, it’s become my daytime lip balm. I find it sits nicely over lip liner without pilling or separating, so it works just as well in a routine as it does as a stand-alone.It’s a shame that …the packaging is basic and plastic – as you’d expect with a lip balm this affordable. Don’t let this put you off buying it.Finish:matt/Size:4.25gPrice perg:from 52pVegan:noCruelty-free:noFragrance-free:noBest natural lip balm:UpCircle lip balmView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£11.99 at UpCircle£12 at AmazonNatural products that perform as well as their synthetic counterparts can be hard to find, but this lip-loving formula from UpCircle hits the spot. The balm is packed with antioxidants, natural oils and humectants to give your lips the TLC they deserve.Why we love itWhen I tested this formula, I was instantly struck by how melty and nourishing it felt. It softened my lips without irritating, and helped protect them from pollutants because it’s rich in antioxidants and natural oils. There’s good reason it’s one of the brand’s bestsellers.I loved using it overnight – there’s no need for SPF, and the formula gets to work without feeling greasy or uncomfortable, unlike other overnight balms. It’s been a staple on my nightstand ever since I tested it.UpCircle has arefill schemethat lets you return your empty glass jars to be refilled at 20% off the standard price. This means less packaging waste.It’s a shame that …there’s no SPF in the formula. And, while the refill scheme is a welcome change, other lip balms – such as the Wild balm below – can be refilled at home.Finish:mattSize:15mlPrice per ml:from 80pVegan:yesCruelty-free:yesFragrance-free:free from artificial fragrance, naturally scented with oilsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It’s available in six shades, ranging from rosy pink to a deep reddish brown – all properly pigmented and offering a glossy wash of colour without the precision needed for a lipstick.I found it easy to apply evenly because of its doughnut-shaped applicator. Over a day, the balm gave my lips lasting hydration and softness – probably due to the hyaluronic acid and ceramides in the formula. I’d suggest using it with a lip liner for a defined look, or on its own for a more relaxed finish.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s heavily fragranced, which makes it less suitable for those with sensitive skin. It also isn’t cruelty-free or vegan.Finish:glossy;size:12g;price perg:from £1.54;vegan:no;cruelty-free:no;fragrance-free:noSupergoop!

They’re as pigmented as a standard lipstick, glide on comfortably and only need reapplication after eating.I tested the shade Love You More, which is a deep berry red, but it’s also available in Lucky Me, a rosy pink shade, and High Five, a peachy red. As well as SPF30, the formula is packed with antioxidantsand soothing chamomile extract, adding a little extra TLC to a great-looking lippy.It didn’t make the final cut because …its high pigment levels and creamy formula made it slightly tricky to apply neatly. But if you regularly wear lipstick and want protected lips, it’s a great option – just use a lip liner before application.Finish:matt;size:3.5g;price perg:from £4.60;vegan:yes;cruelty-free:yes;fragrance-free:free from artificial fragrance, naturally scentedAugustinus Bader lip balm duoView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£65 at Space NK£65 at Augustinus BaderBest for:luxury skincare fansThere’s no getting past it – these lip balms are expensive, but if you’re a fan of luxe skincare, they’re a brilliant buy. They contain Augustinus Bader’s TFC8, a patented component designed to support the skin’s natural regeneration process, combating signs of ageing and skin damage. There’s also castor seed oil to reduce moisture loss and shea butter to soften the lips.On first application, the balm melts on to your lips and leaves them feeling immediately softer, while the tinted version gives a lovely satin finish with a wash of colour. The packaging is gorgeous, too: the two balms come in a gift box and each has a metal case that feels weighty and luxurious. With no nasties in this vegan formula, it’s perfect as a gift for even the fussiest of beauty fanatics.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s expensive compared with other balms. Its luxury formulation could be worth the money to some, though, especially if you’re looking for an indulgent gift.Finish:satin;size:8g;price perg:£8.10;vegan:yes;cruelty-free:yes;fragrance-free:yesWild refillable lip balmView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianFrom £7.20 for a case and a refill at Wild£16.99 for a case and three refills at AmazonBest for:arefillable lip balmWild is best known for making refillable, natural deodorants, and its line of refillable lip balms follows the same environmentally focused ethos. Simply buy a case bundled with a refill (from £7.20) and you’re ready to go. There are seven stylish cases to choose from anda wide range of lip balm flavours available, some of which contain SPF25. Wild releases new flavours often – a new one was introduced while this piece was being edited.I tested the Original SPF formula (a restock is due towards the end of August) and found the refills easy to insert and swap out. I love that the refills are plastic-free, and the luxurious metal cases are durable enough to throw in your bag and forget about. The formula has a solid, waxy, matt finish. On application, I found it gave a smooth coating with no weird films or pilling.It didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t feel as hydrating as other formulations – its waxy formula is more suited to mess-free use on the go. That means it’s not the best as an overnight treatment, but it’s great for daytime use.Finish:matt;size:4.5g;price perg:from 71p;vegan:yes;cruelty-free:yes;fragrance-free:noElf Glow Reviver Melting lip balmView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£9 at Elf Cosmetics£9 at SuperdrugBest for:an affordable tinted balmThis Elf lip balm was an immediate hit. It has an excellent colour range, and each shade has a distinctive smell and taste. I tested the shade Yummy Gummy, which transported me straight back to my childhood with its nostalgic, sweet fruit scent. The balm felt lovely and smooth on the lips, with a glossy finish. It’s packed with emollients and natural oils to soften and hydrate, while its curved applicator hugs the lips, making it easy to apply without a mirror.It didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t have quite the same nourishing power as the higher-end options on the page. But, for the price, it’s a great choice.Finish:glossy;size:15g;price perg:60p;vegan:yes;cruelty-free:yes;fragrance-free:noWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenLook for specific ingredients to combat your lip concerns.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianWhat are the different types of lip balm, and what is each best for?Most people know that lip balms come in various forms, but they may not be aware that experts suggest using different types for treating different concerns.Dr Rakesh Anand, who works atSkin Surgery Associates of London, says: “There are generally four main types [of lip balm]. Occlusive balms (eg petroleum-based) are best for sealing in moisture and protecting lips from environmental stress. Emollient balms (eg lanolin, shea butter) are ideal for smoothing and softening lips. Balms with humectants are good for lips that feel tight or dehydrated, especially overnight. Tinted or cosmetic balms are for daily use when you want some colour, but they may lack the full protective properties of a dedicated treatment balm.”Lip masks are another popular kind of treatment. Consultant dermatologistDr Magnus Lynchadvises these “can be beneficial overnight or during periods of extreme dryness, as [they] deliver intensive hydration and help repair the lip barrier”. But it seems the experts are divided on their value.Dr Jonathan Kentleyof Montrose London and the Lister hospital offers a different perspective: “I don’t see the need [for lip masks]; using a rich occlusive lip balm is enough for dry lips. However, some people do enjoy the ritual.”Instead, Kentley recommends looking for specific ingredients to combat your concerns. “Look out for natural oils such as shea butter and coconut butter, which are full of richly hydrating fatty acids,” he says. “These are deeply moisturising and delightful to apply. Other great natural ingredients include beeswax (produced by the humble honeybee) and lanolin, which is derived from sheep’s wool. These mimic the skin’s natural oils to act as a moisturiser. You may recognise hyaluronic from your serum or facial moisturiser, but it’s also great for hydrating and plumping the lips.”On the flipside, there are some ingredients, such as common irritants, you’ll want to avoid if you have sensitive skin.Dr Derrick Phillips, consultant dermatologist and spokesperson for the British Skin Foundation, advises: “There’s a small risk of developing an allergy to ingredients present in lip balms with repeated use. Common allergens include fragrances, gallates, lanolin, colophony and flavourings, such as vanilla. While these ingredients don’t necessarily need to be avoided, it is important to be aware of the risk.”Should I use a different lip balm in summer and winter?Yes. Lynch says: “In winter, use a thicker, more occlusive balm to protect against cold, dry air, while in summer, a lighter balm with SPF helps guard against sun damage and heat.”Don’t overlook the need for SPF, as Lynch says: “The lips are highly vulnerable to sun damage, which can lead to sunburn, premature ageing and even skin cancer. I recommend using SPF30 or higher on a daily basis.”That said, SPF lip balms can be chalkier than other formulations. Kentley says: “SPF lip balms are notoriously tricky to get right. It’s OK if you’re skiing and don’t mind a whitish smear on your lips, but for daily summer use, you tend to want something a little lighter. The good news is that SPF technology has come on leaps and bounds, and there are many more cosmetically acceptable products out there.” This makes sense, since some of the SPF lip balms I tested left an odd white film on the lips, which wasn’t the look I was going for.Which ingredients are best for extremely dry, chapped lips?Dry, chapped lips can be bothersome. Using the right ingredients can help solve the problem much faster. Anand suggests looking for balms “containing lanolin, petrolatum, ceramides and shea butter, all of which are excellent for restoring the skin barrier. Panthenol (vitamin B5) and bisabolol (from chamomile) can also help soothe inflammation and aid repair. If your lips are persistently cracked, it may be worth avoiding all fragrance and flavours.”If you find yourself needing to reapply your lip balm more frequently every time you use it, your lip balm isn’t the problem – acommon misconception explored by the Guardian recently. It could be down to several reasons, according to Phillips. “Many lip balms are flavoured or taste sweet, which can encourage people to lick their lips, often without realising. This can dry out the lips and result in a need for further application,” he says. So, while tasty lip balms may be more appealing to apply, try using a flavourless balm if you notice this problem.Additionally, Phillips says,“Allergies to ingredients in lip balms can also result in a sensation of dryness despite frequent applications.”Sarah Matthews is ajournalist and skincare enthusiast who can’t quite believe she gets to spend her days reviewing beauty products.

I looked through the fridge and raw compost bin, and found some squash, carrots, apples, cucumber ends, a knob of ginger and a woody stick of lemongrass; I even considered a red cabbage leaf, but decided that brassicas are best kept out of the baking tin. The compost bin is more than a place for leftovers, it’s a source of inspiration, as well as a way to reflect on what we waste; it can even guide us towards cooking more resourcefully and creatively.Compost cake with coconut icingThis is a fun riff on the classic carrot or courgette cake, designed to use up scraps of sweet fruit and veg. Be inventive but discerning with what you include, so think beetroot, squash, apple or citrus zest, and leave the garlic and red onion for another day. If you keep a raw-ingredient compost bin (we use a council-issued one), you can even pick through it for potential ingredients; if not, next time you cook, identify the scraps you could incorporate into this cake, so turning them into something delicious.I normally make this cake with extra-virgin olive oil or sunflower oil, but on this occasion I used leftover plant-based spreads from testing supermarket “butters” forthe food filter column. This recipe makes a large, moist cake that needs a good-sized pan and takes longer to cook than you might think.For the cake300g fruit and vegetable scraps(eg, beetroot peelings, apple cores, squash ends)300g oil, or plant-based spread3 eggs300g wholemealplain flour, fine milled ideally200g unrefined sugar3 tsp baking powderFor the coconut icing (optional)1 can full-fat coconut milk, chilled for at least 10 hours1 tsp vanilla extract65g icing sugar, siftedFinely grated zest of ½ orange, lemon or lime, plus a little extra to finish (optional)1–2 tbsp cornflour, or arrowroot powder (optional; this will make a firmer icing)Mixed seeds and chopped nuts, to top (optional)Rose petals, to top (optional)Start by making the icing. Open the can of chilled coconut milk and scoop just the solidified thick cream into a bowl, leaving the coconut water behind. Add the vanilla extract, icing sugar and, if using, the citrus zest and cornflour, whip until light and fluffy, then cover and put in the fridge.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put your chosen fruit and veg scraps in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add the oil, eggs, flour, sugar and baking powder, and blend again until just combined.Scrape the batter into a greased and lined cake tin, then bake for 55–65 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for five minutes, then turn out on to a rack. Once the cake is completely cool, spread the icing over the top, then scatter with seeds, chopped nuts, rose petals or/and extra grated citrus zest, if you like.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteVegetablesFruitCakeBakingDessertfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While I would never throw a classic out of bed, every now andd then I like to swerve the mayonnaise and do something a little more exuberant. Today’s potato salads are a riot of texture and flavour, and pack a serious punch. They are satisfying enough on their own, but serve them at your next barbecue and you are bound to please the potato pleasure-seekers in your life.Potato chaat salad with yoghurt (pictured top)You can find nylon sev in good Indian supermarkets or online, but if you can’t get hold of any, fistfuls of your favourite bombay mix will do just fine.Prep10 minCook30 minServes4For the date and tamarind chutney5 tbsp tamarind paste4 medjool dates, pitted1 heaped tbsp soft brown sugar½ tsp ground cinnamon½ tsp chilli powder, or to taste1 tsp cumin, toasted and coarsely ground1 tsp chaat masalaBlack salt(kala namak), to taste (optional)For the salad500g jersey royalsSea salt and black pepper400g tinchickpeas, drained and rinsed200g natural yoghurt1 handfulnylon sev, or good-quality bombay mix orsev mamra1 small red onion, peeled and cut into very thin rings1 handfulfinely chopped corianderSeeds from ½ pomegranateFirst make the quick chutney.

Stir in the sugar, cinnamon, chilli, cumin, chaat masala and kala namak, if using. The chutney should have a thick, pouring consistency a bit like ketchup, so add more water if required. Cover and refrigerate until needed.Chop the potatoes into bite-sized pieces, then boil in salted water until tender. Drain, leave to cool completely, then arrange the potatoes on a platter. Scatter over the drained chickpeas, season with sea salt and pepper, and mix. Drizzle over the date and tamarind chutney, dollop on the yoghurt here and there and top with the sev, onion rings, coriander and pomegranate seeds. Serve at once.Spicy peanut butter potato saladView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s spicy peanut butter potato salad.The spicy peanut sauce is very adaptable.

They will then give you a crime reference number. This can be important if your licence is used for fraudulent activity later on. If you’ve misplaced it, this isn’t a necessary step, but can be a good idea if you think there’s a chance it might have been stolen.Apply for a replacement licence through the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) website if you are in England, Scotland and Wales (or theDVAin Northern Ireland), or by phone and post. If you are applying by post, you will need to complete and send the D1 application for a driving licence form, which is available from most post offices. You can also apply by phone, but only if you have a photocard driving licence and none of your details have changed. A new licence costs £20.Keep an eye on your bank accounts for any suspicious activity, just in case your licence is being used for identity theft. It is a good idea to notify your bank, too, so they can flag any suspicious activity.Consider getting identity theft protection if you are worried about fraud. These services monitor your credit for any unusual activity. You can apply for protective registration with Cifas, the UK’s fraud prevention service – this costs £30 for two years. Experian’s Identity Plus offers a similar service – it’s free for 30 days and £10.99 a month after.In the UK you are allowed to drive while you wait for a new licence to arrive.View image in fullscreenIn the UK you are allowed to drive while you wait for a new licence to arrive.Photograph: Peter Titmuss/AlamyAnd when you get a new one …Once you have reported the theft or loss, and completed an application for a replacement licence, you should receive a new one within a week. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself in future:Make a record of your new driving licence number – it’s the unique 16-character code that can be found underneath the licence’s expiry date.Keep it in a secure place, to avoid losing it, or having it stolen again. If the police pull you over while driving, you’re allowed up to a week to take your licence into your local police station, so you don’t need to carry it on you at all times.Set up alerts for your bank accounts to stay ahead of any large or unusual transactions, and be extra cautious with your personal details in the future.If you find your old licence after you’ve applied for, or received, a new one, you need to return it to the DVLA with a note explaining what has happened. You can find the address on theGov.uk website.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsLost or stolenMotoringDVLAIdentity fraudScamsexplainersShareReuse this content"

But Helsinki’s gastronomic offerings are a lot wilder, featuring reindeer, moose, pike perch, salmon soup, herring, seaweed – and even bear meat. And from summer into autumn, Finns’ deep affinity with nature blossoms, fusing local organic produce with foraged berries and mushrooms. This inspires menus to feature whimsical fusions of textures and flavours, all straight from the land.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Garlanded with superlatives, from “friendliest” and “happiest” to “world’s most sustainable city”, this breezy Nordic capital is fast catching up on its foodie neighbours. Enriched by immigrant chefs, the youthful, turbocharged culinary scene now abounds in excellent mid-range restaurants with affordable tasting menus – although wine prices are steep (from €10/£8.60 for a 120ml glass). Vegan and vegetarian alternatives are omnipresent, as are non-alcoholic drinks, many berry based. Tips are unnecessary, aesthetics pared down, locals unostentatious and dining starts early, at 5pm. And, this being Finland, you can digest your meal in a sauna, whether at an island restaurant (Lonna) or high in the sky on the Ferris wheel (SkySauna).Eat, sweat, swim – go Finn!NollaView image in fullscreenNolla has a Michelin green star.Photograph: Nikola TomevskiTop of the table in zero-waste cred is pioneering Nolla (meaning “zero”), which even boasts a designer composter in one corner. It serves regularly changing taster menus (four courses €59, six courses €69) in an old townhouse with a relaxed, hip vibe. Led by Catalan chef and co-owner Albert Franch Sunyer, the 70-seater espouses localism and upcycling: staff uniforms are made from old curtains and sheets, while the base of a wine bottle becomes a butter dish. Nothing goes to waste, whether leftover bread or used coffee grounds (an ingredient in a roasted hay ice-cream). Goose is a recent innovation, roasted deliciously with honey turnips, parsnip puree and hazelnut crumble, while Finncattle carpaccio with a radish and tomato harissa dressing brings an exotic hit. With aMichelin green star, Nolla’s easygoing atmosphere and strict environmental policies make it a winner.restaurantnolla.comMuruNot far from Nolla, in the popular central area, is long-standing Muru, one of the first French-style bistros in Helsinki. Masterminded by award-winning sommelier Samuil Angelov, it’s intimate, with a slightly worn, rustic edge and eccentricities that stretch to a wine store at the top of a vertiginous ladder. The changing menus (four courses €59, two courses €39) are chalked on a blackboard in Finnish, which any waiter will translate – English is virtually a second language in Helsinki. Depending on the season, you might indulge in a starter of lavaret (freshwater fish) with pickled cucumber, radishes and dill flower, a nettle risotto with rhubarb and parmesan (risottos are Muru’s speciality) and end with a luscious pannacotta and strawberry dessert.murudining.fiThe RoomView image in fullscreenA gilded turnip at The Room, where ‘gold rules’.Photograph: Fiona DunlopThis is where the Middle East comes to Finland – dramatically. Cloistered in a curtained room, 14 diners sit around a kitchen bar to watch Kurdish chef Kozeen Shiwan enact his gastronomic life story. This is represented by 14 meticulously conjured courses – from a single richly decorated olive (“Made in Suleymaniah) to a spicy quail’s leg buried in flowers (“Flora’s Quail”). Each dish is introduced by the chef’s witty patter. Gold rules, too, whether in Kozeen’s teeth, his necklace, or encasing a platter of glittering potatoes baked with amba sauce and roe before they sink into a mayo, saffron and olive oil sauce. It’s a memorable dining performance (€159), but make sure Kozeen is present on the night you book, and choose wine by the glass rather than the €119 wine pairing.kozeenshiwan.comFinlandia HallView image in fullscreenAlvar Aalto’s monumental Finlandia Hall.Photograph: Fiona DunlopNobody can visit Helsinki without paying homage toAlvar Aalto(1898-1976), the groundbreaking architect and designer who brought functionalism to Finland. After three years of renovation, his monumentalFinlandia Hall, an events centre which opened in 1971, now includes a sleekly designed bistro and a cafe. Everything in the building is by Aalto, from lighting to furniture and brass fittings, explained in an illuminating permanent exhibition. On the food front, the bistro (open for dinner Thursday to Saturday) offers typically creative Nordic cuisine with Mediterranean accents (four courses €59, six courses €69, plus à la carte) in a moody interior. For more luminosity, or for lunch, head for Finlandia Café&Wine (open all week), with terrace views over the bay. Self-service snacks and drinks are backed up by a daily lunch special (€14.70) or a copious breakfast (€19.90) – porridge included, of course.finlandiatalo.fiNokkaView image in fullscreenWarehouse spaciousness … Nokka.Photograph: Fiona DunlopDown on the south harbour, beside a stretch of other eateries, Nokka’s spacious warehouse is full of nautical artefacts and enlarged sketches of wild animals. The philosophy of chef-founder Ari Ruoho, a keen hunter and fisher, is to bring Finland’s peerless “wild nature” on to the plate, nose to tail. Apart from the wild meat, there is a huge emphasis on organic vegetables. There are three menus (four courses €89, vegetarian €74, eight courses from €129) and à la carte options. The smoked bream mousse starter with pickled cucumber, cucumber sorbet and a crispbread combining fish skin with dried roe and pumpkin seeds (€24) is a revelation, as is tender roasted reindeer, seasonal vegetables and roast potatoes with grated elk heart. This is ambitious, perfectly honed food that easily justifies its Michelin green star.nokkahelsinki.fiLonnaView image in fullscreenLonna restaurant.Photograph: Fiona DunlopSeveral thousand islands speckle the Gulf of Finland, so there’s no excuse not to hop on a ferry for a 10-minute ride to Lonna island. Here, recycling comes with a twist, as ageing military structures now house an eponymous restaurant with bar and terrace overlooking the Baltic. Add to that a beach, a sleekly designed sauna and views to Helsinki and you have a bucolic escape. The 60-seater Lonna restaurant is low key, with bare brick walls and gorgeous Finnish tableware, and is open May to September. Excellent-value menus (three courses €39) change monthly, offering local organic produce and plentiful vegetarian options, such as oyster mushrooms with barley and smoked tomato, or a meaty option such as organic pork with bok choi and trout roe.lonna.fiBona FideView image in fullscreenA tomato salad at Bona Fide.Photograph: Fiona DunlopIn an elegant residential neighbourhood, this quirky little restaurant offers a four-course menu (€48) tweaked every few weeks. “We do what’s in season, using French technique and good ingredients from abroad, and only wild game or fish,” says Ilpo Vainonen, one of the two young chefs who are co-owners with sommelier and manager Johan Borgar. Like many of their peers, they make their own bread, which comes with a black olive dip. Every dish is presented superbly: try a starter combining fresh and semi-dried tomatoes framed by hazelnuts, cream cheese and tiny cherries, or an ice-cream in a puddle of olive oil served with a pan of stone fruits poached in rum syrup. Suddenly, a spoonful of raspberry sorbet coated in pink peppercorn appears.

One woman’s quest raises questionsInspired by Indigenous practices, Mikaela de la Myco has collected stories of mothers who say psilocybin helped them during pregnancy. US scientists are skepticalCecilia NowellWed 16 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 15.47 EDTShareWhen Mikaela found out she was pregnant six years ago, she knew she needed to stop drinking. What she wasn’t sure about was how she would manage the cravings.As a teenager, she had discovered that alcohol and opiates could dull traumatic memories, including recurrent sexual assaults that played in her mind nonstop and led to suicidal thoughts. But as she entered her 20s, eager to address her mental health, she realized what helped most was psilocybin.Mikaela had found her way to psilocybin, the psychedelic compound active in “magic” mushrooms, with close friends at the age of 19. A few large doses a year, with smaller microdoses in between, helped her achieve a sense of calm, like the bad trip that had been her whole life before mushrooms had ended.She also noticed they lessened her cravings for alcohol. Instead of picking up a beer when she would crave one, she tried microdosing. Indeed, recentresearchhas shown that psilocybin may be a promising treatment for alcohol use disorder: in a 2022 study, psilocybin combined with therapy helped trial participants significantly reduce their drinking for the eight months researchers conducted follow-ups.Ethical constraints have limited clinical studies on psilocybin use among individuals in childbearing yearsMikaela de la MycoShe scoured the internet for information, unsure those mushrooms were safe for her pregnancy. At the same time, she knew she needed to stop drinking. Under no circumstances did she want her child to grow up with an alcoholic parent – like she had.As her Google searches brought up dead end after dead end, Mikaela, who has Indigenous Mexican ancestry, reached out to an Indigenous woman-led group that conducted ceremonies using plant medicines such as tobacco and peyote. The group was coordinating a psilocybin ceremony, where participants were planning to ingest mushrooms under the guidance of an elder, a few hours north of her inCaliforniain a few weeks’ time. Mikaela asked if the woman who was leading it, a grandmother from Jalisco, Mexico, had any insight into whether participating would be harmful to her pregnancy. The woman told Mikaela that in her tradition, mothers continued consuming plant medicines such as psilocybin throughout their pregnancies and into motherhood. Mikaela packed up her car and drove out to the gathering.Under the canopy of a redwood grove, Mikaela accepted the fresh mushrooms the grandmother had prepared for her. As the sun began to set, Mikaela’s gaze wandered from the campfire before her to the stars above, and she fell into an hours-long meditation.View image in fullscreenAfter giving birth to a healthy baby boy, Mikaela wondered if Indigenous knowledge about plant medicines could be transmitted to other mothers battling mental health challenges during pregnancy.Photograph: DJA/The GuardianSitting around a campfire the next day, the grandmother placed her hands on Mikaela’s visibly pregnant belly and shared a message with her and the other participants.“She talked very openly about the meaningfulness of carrying children and our responsibility as parents and mothers, and what it means to choose to be a mom at this time,” said Mikaela, now 31.Mikaela went on to use psilocybin, in both microdoses and full doses, throughout her pregnancy and since. She credits it with helping her develop “a repulsion to the alcohol”, she said, and to the social spaces where it was consumed.Soon after she gave birth to a healthy baby boy, she set out to find the answers she had been looking for. She knew researchers did not usually look like her or ask questions like hers, but she wondered if Indigenous knowledge about plant medicines could be transmitted to other mothers battling mental health challenges during pregnancy – and were struggling to find answers.“Ethical constraints have limited clinical studies on psilocybin use among individuals in childbearing years, particularly during pregnancy and breastfeeding,” she wrote ina “community research paper”surveying 411 people who used psilocybin before, during or after their pregnancies published earlier this year. “This gap in research, compounded by the lingering stigma surrounding psychedelics, has left mothers to navigate their choices in isolation.”In the paper, Mikaela uses the pseudonym “de la Myco”, or “of the mushroom”, in place of her last name, citing the stigma and legal concerns associated with psychedelic use. (Psilocybin is still classified as a schedule one drug under federal law, though it has been decriminalized by several states.) She also uses the pseudonym on social media, where she has upwards of 200,000 followers and has built a brand discussing psychedelics, selling herbal birth control remedies and sharing her parenting experience. Alongside posts describing how to use a Queen Anne’s Lace tincture and other herbs, she describes her preparations for ingesting mushrooms and how they have deepened her spirituality.She also shares videos showing her playing, cooking and talking about feelings with her son, in response to comments that she “better pray that doing that has no long-term effects on your child”.Mikaela’s work seeks to inject the concerns and knowledge of communities – particularly women andIndigenous peoples– that have often been excluded from scientific research, but are central to the history of psychedelic use. At the same time, it comes alongside a growing movement that is mistrustful of modern medicine – and more likely to seek advice from accessible social media platforms than unaffordable or distant doctors’ offices. And it makes some medical professionals nervous.Over the past two decades, psychedelics havereturned to the public eyeas a growing body of research shows their potential benefits in treating mental health conditions such as PTSD, treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, alcoholism and other disorders. In the United States,hundreds of clinical trialshave investigated the medical benefits of psilocybin.Some researchers remain skeptical of the drugs’ potential, citing the biases ofresearchersandpoor study designs. In August last year the Food and Drug Administration rejected an application to approve the use of another psychedelic, MDMA, in the treatment of PTSD. (In December, the VA announced that it will still fund new research into MDMA-assisted therapy for the treatment of PTSD and alcoholism.)If we don’t have information, as scientists and as medical people, we would say it’s not safe until we know that it isAnita ClaytonGiven the setback, it’s possible that psilocybin-assisted therapywill gain FDA approvalahead of MDMA. Three states have already legalized the use of psilocybin at licensed therapeutic centers – Oregon first in 2020, followed by Colorado in 2022 and New Mexico this year – while dozens of other cities have decriminalized it.While ongoingclinical trialsindicatethat psychedelics, including psilocybin, may have important applications to the treatment of postpartum depression, very little is known about their safety during pregnancy. Emerging research into the health benefits of psychedelics has omitted pregnant people – as has most research on medication safety.Regarding psilocybin, “If we don’t have information, as scientists and as medical people, we would say it’s not safe until we know that it is,” said Anita Clayton, a professor of psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences at the University of Virginia school of medicine who is currently studying the use of a drug with a similar chemical structure to psilocybin in the treatment of postpartum depression. “Because the facts we have are limited, people fill the gaps with what they want to be true,” Clayton added. “Women also need to know about potential treatment options” for mental health conditions.View image in fullscreenIn 2023, Mikaela and a UK-based doula, Naomi Tolson, publicized a survey collecting the stories of women who had used any amount of mushrooms during pregnancy.The project represents one of the largest collections of experiences on psilocybin and pregnancy to date. But not everyone has embraced it.Photograph: DJA/The GuardianDrug researchers have long taken a protectionist approach to studying medication safety during pregnancy. Their caution can be traced to the thalidomide crisis of the 1950s and early 1960s, when more than 10,000 babies were born with severe birth defects after their mothers took a widely prescribed tranquilizer for nausea while pregnant. In the aftermath, rather than studying the impacts of medications on pregnancy, researchers broadly excluded pregnant people from clinical trials.Less than 10% of medicationsapproved by the Food and Drug Administration since 1980 have enough data to determine whether they cause birth defects.In the absence of data from clinical trials, researchers have found other ways to monitor medication safety during pregnancy. One of those methods is the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System and other large data registries. When medications are taken widely during pregnancy – whether a painkiller such as Tylenol or an antidepressant such as Prozac – researchers assess safety through observational data.Because of that, scientists know that many antidepressants, including most SSRIs, “do not appear to cause significant problems in babies exposed to them”, said Clayton. “Certainly not as much as untreated depression in pregnancy.”Researchers have a sense of the hazards of certain more commonly used illicit drugs – such ascannabis(studies suggest that frequent use may be connected with an increased chance of adverse outcomes) andfentanyl(which can cause withdrawal symptoms in newborns). But the existing research into the effects of using psilocybin during pregnancy is extremely limited.Studies have not been done to see if taking magic mushrooms can increase the chance of pregnancy-related problems or birth defects, notes a fact sheet fromMotherToBaby, a network of university and hospital researchers who track information on medication use during pregnancy. One animal study did show that psilocybin crossed the placental barrier and accumulated in fetal tissue in rats, but research hasn’t been done to assess whether that’s true in humans and if it could result in developmental issues. Because psilocybin interacts with serotonin receptors in the brain, somehavealsotheorizedthat if it crosses the placental barrier it could affect fetal brain development.When Oregon legalized the use of psilocybin in licensed centers in 2020, it bumped up against this gap in knowledge. Rather than prohibiting pregnant people from ingesting psilocybin, it decided to require centers to completean informed consent protocolwith patients, which alerts them that “the risks of consuming psilocybin while pregnant or feeding with breast milk are unknown”.After she gave birth to her son, Mikaela began collecting the limited information she could find about psychedelics and parenting, and sharing that information on social media, including Instagram and TikTok. Eventually,the Microdosing Institute, a psychedelics education network focused on the practice of taking a dose of psychedelics much smaller than one might ingest recreationally – to enhance creativity or relieve pain, for example – reached out to hear more about her work.There, she met James Fadiman, a psychologist and writer, often called the “father of microdosing”. Since 2010, Fadiman has interviewed thousands of people who have microdosed psilocybin in an effort to develop a protocol for using mushrooms to treat common psychological and physical complaints. He published what he found inThe Psychedelic Explorer’s Guidein 2011.Neither Fadiman nor Mikaela have psychiatric training – Fadiman holds a PhD in psychology and Mikaela a bachelor’s in English literature – but his strategy would inform her own research. In 2023, she and a UK-based doula publicized a survey across their networks and social media platforms. The aim was to collect the stories of people who had used any amount of psilocybin while pregnant or parenting. In recognition of the ethical complexity of conducting research during pregnancy, they were clear that they were notencouragingthem to ingest mushrooms, but simplydocumentingtheir experience if they already had.“They already made the choice,” said Wendy Shoef, a California-based life coach who later joined the team. “You’re not a part of the process. You just want to get the information from them after the fact.”Earlier this year, the women releaseda collectionof the stories they received so far. The survey includes the experiences of 178 people who used psilocybin during pregnancy and 237 who used it while breastfeeding. After a round of initial responses, Mikaela and her colleagues began asking mothers to report their birth outcomes, but ultimately were only able to gather data from 14. (All reported healthy, full-term births, but the small number of responses, along with the methodology of the survey, mean the results should not be extrapolated more broadly.)Still, the project represents one of the largest collections of experiences on psilocybin and pregnancy to date. But not everyone has embraced it.View image in fullscreen‘You have to be careful not to try to quantify results in a qualitative study because you can’t be sure’ whether the survey participants are truly representative, said physician Charles Schauberger.Photograph: DJA/The Guardian“I’m sure you’re doing a great job of collecting as much data as possible and when you have published this data in a scientific journal we might be interested in having you share these results with the public,” a representative of the Atlanta Mushroom Festival wrote back when Mikaela applied to speak at the annual gathering in 2024. “Claiming that it’s OK to consume any psychedelics during pregnancy is a very sensitive claim and is not something we want to promote without better scientific backing.”Clayton, the University of Virginia professor, worries “the type of data that they’re trying to collect may not be informative” because it’s not coming from “a general population” but a network of regular psychedelic users with links to Mikaela and her colleagues, which could skew any conclusions. Nor does the survey control for other health-related behaviors on the part of the participants. She also notes that it’s difficult to estimate how much psilocybin a person is consuming when those mushrooms are purchased outside of a legal setting.Instead, she said, scientists need to conduct rigorous animal studies first – and that those might reveal whether psilocybin has any impact on metrics like birth weight or developmental milestones.Mikaela’s own biases are clear: she is a vocal proponent of psilocybin’s benefits, as are many of the women she surveyed, so it’s not surprising that the survey’s results would be positive, and she knows they cannot be extrapolated more broadly. She calls her work “an anthropological inquiry” focused less on western standards of science and more on storytelling as a way to understand people’s experiences.Charles Schauberger, a Wisconsin-based physician board certified in obstetrics and gynecology and addiction medicine, echoes the idea. He thinks that with a willingness to follow certain guidelines, the group could produce an important qualitative study – focused on subjective experiences rather than statistical outcomes or objective markers of infant health.I had a very troubled pregnancy emotionally […] I felt the calling to microdose to help me regulate my nervous systemA response to Mikaela’s survey“You have to be careful not to try to quantify results in a qualitative study because you can’t be sure” whether the survey participants are truly representative, he said. Instead, he said, researchers might ask: “Did you feel like your depression was better? Who did you consult to feel comfortable that it was safe to use psilocybin in your pregnancy? Did you use it just once? Did you use it multiple times? What are your feelings now that your baby’s born and you’re no longer pregnant?”The answers to those questions might help researchers design future quantitative studies, giving them insight on where to focus their inquiries. And in a field with a severe shortage of information, that addition to the literature could be helpful, he said.As Mikaela and her collaborators began distributing their survey, they noticed that a focus on mental health was a central thread through the responses they received.“I mainly consumed mushrooms during my pregnancy with my second daughter because I was trying to escape an extremely toxic environment,” one woman wrote in her reply.“I had a very troubled pregnancy emotionally. My relationship was decaying and I didn’t have the support system I needed at the time,” another woman who ingested mushrooms while pregnant shared. “I felt the calling to microdose to help me regulate my nervous system.”Many of the women reported that they preferred psychedelics to pharmaceuticals as a more natural alternative.“I felt severe depression symptoms for months on end and decided I needed to microdose or take an antipsychotic,” another mother who used psilocybin during her pregnancy shared. “The microdose felt safer to me.”In their report, Mikaela and her co-authors cite breastfeeding mothers who “described feeling more emotionally connected to their babies and more capable of navigating the challenges of early parenthood with calm and clarity”.“I was able to be present and appreciative of my life without stressing about all I ‘should’ or ‘could’ be getting done,” one mother wrote.Many parents also voiced fears that consuming mushrooms during pregnancy or while breastfeeding their children could land them in a police precinct. As one woman wrote, she felt great “anxiety around getting my baby taken away if anyone found out”.The legal advocacy groupPregnancyJustice has documented thousands of cases where pregnant people were criminalized over allegations of substance use between 1973 and 2022, though very few were related to psychedelics.View image in fullscreen‘I am not advocating for western women to do this,’ said Stacy Schaefer, professor emerita in anthropology at California State University, Chico.But Indigenous communities have been using psychedelics during pregnancy ‘for generations, perhaps centuries’.Photograph: DJA/The GuardianNaomi Tolson, the UK-based doula who helped launch the study, said that fear of criminalization and stigma probably limited the responses they received. “Even though the survey is anonymous, people still worry,” she said.Some scientists, such as Clayton and Anthony Scialli, a specialist in developmental and reproductive toxicology and director of the Reproductive Toxicology Center, worry about such DIY efforts playing into the Trump administration’s full-frontal assault on the United States’ scientific institutions. Scialli notes a growing wave of skepticism of pharmaceuticals – skepticism that has been championed by the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr.“If there is research out there” about psilocybin and pregnancy, “I haven’t seen it,” he said, but, “on most of the antidepressants there are many studies and very good studies”. Yet, he points to a growing conservative backlash against science: “I understand it’s fashionable for people not to believe scientific studies. After all, we have a whole bunch of people in the administration who don’t believe in scientific studies.”For her part, Mikaela calls Kennedy “a complete quack”, but voices tentative appreciation that he has been “open-minded to psychedelics”.At the same time, some psychedelic advocates and scholars argue that there is information out there on the safety of psychedelics during pregnancy – it’s just not been formalized in the western canon. While completing her doctoral research in the 1980s, Stacy Schaefer, professor emerita in the department of anthropology at California State University, Chico, joined an Indigenous Mexican community, called the Wixárika, on their annual pilgrimage to the lands where they have long foraged peyote. “I couldn’t help but notice that there were several women in the group, at various stages of their pregnancy. And, some of them were nursing their babies,” said Schaefer.She learned that the women credited peyote with inducing lactation and easing labor pains. And the use of psychedelics during pregnancy was not limited to the Wixárika. She would later find that Brazilian women in the Santo Daime and União do Vegetal churches regularly consume ayahuasca during pregnancy.“I am not advocating for western women to do this,” Schaefer said, emphasizing that, as psychedelics gain popularity, it’s vital that practitioners conserve rare plants and avoid profiting off of Indigenous practices. But Indigenous communities have been using psychedelics during pregnancy “for generations, perhaps centuries”.Schaefer believes that the scientific community has much to learn on women’s health from Indigenous people, who possess expertise with various plant-based medicines and “knowledge of the body that may not be in the same vocabulary and terms and concepts that we in western medicine have, but they’re just as valid”.The end-of-life patients finding solace in magic mushrooms: ‘What life after life could be like’Read moreTwo years into collecting survey responses, Mikaela and her colleagues know their work is nowhere near over. But she feels like they have reached an inflection point as they begin collaborating with a doctoral student to redo the survey structure and submit proposals to publish the work in a peer-reviewed research journal.The team aims to collect stories from twice as many mothers. Mikaela is also eager to continue following the families they have already connected with, to better understand their long-term experiences.Mikaela doesn’t know whether the scientific community will come to embrace “community research” on women’s health that integrates Indigenous knowledge. At a moment where each of those subjects is tied up in complex political narratives and disinformation campaigns, the path ahead might be thorny. But she’s pressing on all the same.Reporting for this story was supported by a Feriss-UC Berkeley Psychedelic Journalism FellowshipThis article was amended on 16 July 2025 to clarify the nature of Mikaela de la Myco’s social media presence.Explore more on these topicsDrugsHealthPregnancyIndigenous peoplesWomen's healthMental healthParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The distance from the nearest towns – Alice Springs, in one direction, to Tennant Creek in the other – is more than 560km, the equivalent of a journey from London to Düsseldorf.The search for Peter FalconioKate Vanderlaan, the retired former acting commissioner of the NT Police Force, was the head of the Alice Springs crime division in 2001 and recalls the days and weeks immediately after Falconio went missing.Lees told police she managed to escape and hide in the bush for hours while Murdoch searched for her, with the help of his dog, until she flagged down a truck driver and called for help.View image in fullscreenLees (centre) reads a statement with Falconio’s brother, Paul (right).Photograph: Steve Holland/AP“My most significant memory was that it was a very difficult investigation in the early days,” Vanderlaan said.“It wasn’t clear cut [at the outset] as to who did it, [and] there was significant media interest.“I’d never dealt with such media scrutiny before. We had a description of the vehicle and the recollection [of Lees], but at the end of the day, it was starting from scratch because you don’t know the motive … other than it was such a random thing.“We got so much information, sometimes that was quite overwhelming – how to deal with it.”View image in fullscreenPolice recreate the scene near Barrow Creek where the British backpackers were ambushed, using two vehicles, a VW Kombi and a white ute, similar to those used by the tourists and the killer.Photograph: Brian Cassey/APVanderlaan recalls searching for Falconio’s body in the first few weeks after he disappeared.“The initial search was concentrated along the road or within a kilometre of the road. But it’s vast, and the burial evidence would probably dissipate pretty quickly. They were pretty thorough in their searches, but it’s like a needle in a haystack,” she said.“We’ve had so many different suggestions and thoughts since, and they’ve all been followed up. It was always the case that if we had some leads, it was always followed up. We had the psychics and those people thinking they knew where the body was.”Responsibility denied until endMurdoch was convicted by a jury in December 2005 and sentenced to life in prison, with a non-parole period of 28 years.In the time since, he has steadfastly maintained his innocence, including several unsuccessful attempts to appeal against his conviction.His family released a statement on Wednesday, acknowledging his death.View image in fullscreenAustralian police released an image of an unidentified man wanted for the murder of Peter Falconio,taken from security footage at Barrow Creek in 2001.Photograph: REUTERS“To many, Bradley Murdoch is known only for the events that led to his conviction in 2005 for the murder of British backpacker Peter Falconio, a crime for which he has always denied responsibility from his arrest until his death,” the statement said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was known to have a racist tattoo, depicting an Aboriginal man.Within the prison system, he was reported to havedeveloped significant influence.A secret taken to the graveThe search for Falconio’s remains has fascinated police, journalists and amateur sleuths for years.In 2014, Australian current affairs program Today Tonight claimed to have discovered a possible location for Falconio’s body in a well at Neutral Junction, about a kilometre from the crime scene at Barrow Creek.View image in fullscreenThe VW Kombi camper van belonging to Lees and Falconio was impounded as evidence at the Northern Territory supreme court for Murdoch’s murder trial.Photograph: Ian Waldie/EPAIt later emerged thesegment had been filmed three years earlier.After decades of fruitless searches, the best hope remained the possibility, however remote, that Murdoch might confess and reveal where Falconio was buried.Sources familiar with the Northern Territory’s dealings with Murdoch say they tried “all manner of things” to elicit a confession.In 2016, the NT introduced “no body, no parole” laws. There was only one prisoner in the Territory’s jails who was affected. But Murdoch remained silent.

An hour’s drive west of Istanbul, it was famed for its lavender, its yoghurt, and its summer houses dotted along the Marmara Sea. But to most in Turkey now, Silivri means something different: not the town, but the mega-complex a little further down the coast. This is the prison that since March has held the Istanbul mayor – and rival to president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan – Ekrem İmamoğlu, as he awaits trial for corruption – and now,the place where he has been given a twenty month sentence, in another of the litany of charges against him, for insulting and ‘threatening’ a public official.Erdoğan rival given prison term for threatening Istanbul prosecutorRead moreIt started taking in prisoners in 2008. Turkish coverage at the time marvelled at the size. Here was a complex – a “campus”, in the new lingo – made of nine separate prisons, spread across almost 1m sq metres, and with a stated capacity of 11,000 people. For the on-site staff alone, there were 500 apartments, a mosque, a market and restaurant, and a primary school for their children. As one prisoner would later write, he would hear them from his cell singing the Turkish national anthem in the playground.Silivri was meant to replace the dilapidated old inner-city jails. It had, it was breathlessly reported, TV and radios in every cell, more than 2,000 security cameras, and eye retina scans for staff coming in and out. Prisoners had access to an indoor sports centre and two open-air football pitches.The mega-prison was swept into a broader narrative of the early Erdoğan years – of a country that was modernising fast. And soon events at Silivri would speak to something deeper too, and hopes that Erdoğan was breathing new life into Turkish democracy itself.View image in fullscreenTurkish army soldiers stand guard outside a court in Silivri.Photograph: Emrah Gürel/APFor before Silivri was even completed, it began to host a series of groundbreaking trials. Prosecutors had claimed to have unearthed a series of plots among Turkey’s old, secular establishment – generals and police chiefs, journalist and lawyers – aimed at overthrowing its elected Islamist government. Hundreds of them were tried at a time in Silivri, not in its courtrooms but in one of its gym halls repurposed for the task, as scores of gendarmes guarded the prison’s perimeter. It seemed, for many onlookers, that Silivri was the scene of a historic reckoning with Turkey’s past – of the humbling of a secular military elite who had overshadowed democracy for so long.But by the time the guilty verdicts came in 2012, many in Turkey were having doubts. The indictments, it turned out, were full of inaccuracies, typos and doctored documents. In fact, there was scant evidence that the plots had existed at all. In hindsight, the Silivri trials hinted at what was to come: the use of police and prosecutors, courts and police to go after the government’s opponents.It was all accelerated in Erdoğan’s second decade in power, a period marked by not only a failed coup but a state of emergency and a new constitution. A political crackdown brought the arrests of activists, journalists, lawyers, politicians and tens of thousands of ordinary citizens besides. Meanwhile, a moral panic about urban crime led to a huge increase in prison time for petty offences. Turkey’s prison population began to soar.In 2002, when Erdoğan’s party came to power, Turkey had about 60,000 prisoners; now it probably has over 350,000. In the Council of Europe’s latest report, Turkey was said to have about as many imprisoned as the other 45 countries put together. Silivri, built to a capacity of 11,000, was most recently reported to be housing 22,000 people. It is one of the largest prisons in the world.The conditions have always been austere. As the author Ahmet Altan described – during his own imprisonment after the failed coup – occasionally in the spring, passing birds would drop flowers for their nests into his small and sunless courtyard. Once he took one and put it in a plastic bottle to decorate his cell. The next day, the officers took the flower away.Lawyers, wardens, former inmates and their families all speak of a system overstretched: of units for 21 housing nearly 50; of meals shrinking, or of mattresses having to be shared out in shifts; or, during weekly exercise sessions on Silivri’s much-vaunted sports pitches, inmates trying to organise a game of football with 40 players at a time.There have always been accusations – denied by the prison authorities – of frequent beatings by guards and deliberate acts of humiliation. In a case three years ago, after an inmate died in Silivri, the prison insisted the cause was a heart attack. His family did not believe it and said his body had been beaten black and blue.The detention of inmates such as İmamoğlu tends to be different. Kept in isolation, in a unit specifically reserved for its high-profile political prisoners, few report any physical mistreatment.Instead, the punishment is the Turkish court process itself: pre-trial detentions that can last years; judges and prosecutors under intense political pressure; and even – as İmamoğlu has found out – the possibility that an inmate’s lawyer might be detained too.Today, Silivri has become a symbol of how far Erdoğan is willing to go to stay in power. So much so that the prison’s infamous name has found itself part of a Turkish phrase.Silivri soğuk –meaning Silivri’s cold – is said to friends, half in jest, half in warning, when they say or do something political deemed to go over the line.Explore more on these topicsTurkeyRecep Tayyip ErdoğanHuman rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We need net zero, but at what cost?, 14 July), there might be good reasons for opposing a windfarm on the Yorkshire moors, but Emily Brontë isn’t one of them. Nor is the “turbulent romance” of Wuthering Heights an appropriate filter through which to view the Pennines. The Brontës’ local landscape would have changed considerably in their lifetime. They would have seen the rapid industrialisation of nearby towns such as Bradford and Halifax, and the mills that sprang up along the river in Haworth.They would have recognised the benefits of the expansion of the railways despite the impact on the countryside (their brother, Branwell, worked as a railway clerk). The “historic Brontë village of Haworth” where they grew up was not a rural idyll, but a breeding ground for cholera and typhoid. The Brontë sisters must have applauded the campaign by their father, Patrick, for improved sanitation there, leading to the creation of a local reservoir that doubtless affected the countryside but also saved lives.We cannot afford to cordon off parts of the UK as a nostalgic theme park (“Brontë country”). Nor should we romanticise the lives of a family who grew up in an unimaginably unhealthy environment and died young as a result. The clean energy produced by windfarms is vastly preferable to the polluted environment thatEmily Brontëendured, and it is likely that she of all people would have understood why a clean environment should be our first priority.Jane MiddletonBathSome of what Simon Jenkins writes about windfarms in beauty spots, on the necessity to protect the scientific importance of such areas, is unlikely to ruffle many feathers, but much of it sounds more like the Miliband neighbours he references. Only a day tripper wanting to see the moors and dropped off for 20 minutes on a pleasant spring day “strolls” on the Pennine Way.If you haven’t walked to Top Withens on a raw winter day, with sleet biting your cheeks, the wind wuthering, and water being blown uphill instead of flowing down, you cannot understand why the Pennines is such a great place for a windfarm. My great-grandchildren will still be able to walk the Pennine Way, with or without turbines.Heather BoddenWakefield, West YorkshireSimon Jenkins misunderstands what net zero is when he labels it “a political ambition rather than a plausible target”. TheUN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changesays clearly: “From a physical science perspective, limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative CO2emissions, reaching at least net zero CO2emissions”. And both the IPCC and the UK’s Climate Change Committee are clear that it is not just plausible but achievable, with the latter’s recentseventh carbon budgetproviding “an ambitious, deliverable pathway for the UK to reach net zero by 2050”.So net zero is a scientific concept that is required to stop climate change. Indeed, net zero not only can but must be met if we are to avoid ever more dangerous impacts long into the future.Gareth Redmond-KingEnergy and Climate Intelligence UnitSimon Jenkins asks what landscapes we will lose in the bid to achieve net zero. He ought, rather, to ponder what will be left of them if we don’t achieve this goal.Jane CaplanOxfordHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

In my reply, I citedGalileo, who said, “And yet it moves”, when the religious authorities of his day insisted that the sun goes round the Earth and forced him to recant his view that the Earth goes round the sun.For the record, I do not support Palestine Action because, like Galileo, I have been forced to recant the truth.

Plus,Alan Crawsays England should follow Wales in considering a land value taxWed 16 Jul 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 13.07 EDTShareThe reasons that Andy Beckett adduces for Labour foregrounding the redistribution of wealth are all valid and appropriate (Why is Labour so afraid to admit that we must tax the rich? 11 July). But there is one that is even more compelling and even more central to government priorities.Far from wealth redistribution being inimical to economic growth, there is overwhelming evidence – not least from international organisations like the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – that redistribution to ensure a fairer distribution of income and wealth is extremely positive for economic growth, the main reason being that the less well off spend a higher proportion of their more limited incomes, whereas the better off tend to save or invest in their assets; there is no or very little “trickling down”. In fact, as a result of increased economic inequality, and even though interest rates remain historically low, the major anglophone economies continue to suffer a classic case of what Keynes called “underconsumption” due to the inability of the poorer members of society to keep up previous levels of demand for goods and services.Roger BrownAuthor of TheInequalityCrisisThe concept of “wealth taxation” takes up much space in the Guardian. Too little mention is made of how it might operate. Governments need to look much harder at the concept of land value taxation (LVT) to overcome the prejudice and fear of what might be considered as “wealth” to be taxed.LVT is being seriously considered by the Welsh government and should be debated in England too. It would produce a long-term revenue stream for any future government. For example, land values along the Elizabeth line in London rose hugely when it was being built. Why was that not taxed? Likewise with HS2: land values rose near its proposed stations and are still rising near Euston in anticipation of completion. Tax that value at 2% annually and HS2 is paid for.Alan CrawChesterfield, DerbyshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

You may say that support for colleges is implicit – but it’s exactly the invisibility of the college sector in the public mind that explains the lack of material investment in them.Arguably, universities have sucked out many of the young people from coastal towns – not deliberately, of course, and they should not be blamed for this. But it’s a consequence of the general low level of appreciation of the value of the college sector.A further related gripe: in the recent spending review, there was some increase in funding levels for young students, but none for adults. Colleges such as the Working Men’s College in Camden, north London, whichrecently celebrated its 170th birthdayand which specialises in learning opportunities for adults of all ages, is really suffering. Wouldn’t it be good for coastal towns (and elsewhere) if there were more chances for all adults from 18 upwards to learn together?Tom SchullerLondonExplore more on these topicsFurther educationYoung peoplelettersShareReuse this content"

As a minor he cannot be named under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.The OPP’s Bill Dickson said officers at first believed the girl was attacked by an animal due to the nature of her injuries, but that he could not comment on them in detail.“While we proceeded looking at this as a suspected animal attack, the investigation also continued to look at other aspects,” Dickson said. “You can’t go into an investigation like this with tunnel vision.” He added that police could not comment on what led them to arrest the teenager, as the case is before the courts.The allegations have rocked the one-intersection community, whose close-knit nature is illustrated by the fact that the victim’s family and the suspect’s family know each other, Dickson said.After the attack, police held a town hall on 12 July to address swirling questions, including why it took them until 9pm on the day the girl went missing to begin searching. “It does take time to get some of the specialized services here,” Derek Needham, acting chief superintendent with the OPP, told residents, according to the CBC, though a resident responded: “As a parent, that’s not good enough … you guys should be there when the call is put out.”The local Pentecostal church has led a fundraiser for the family, with the pastor, Joseph Fiorentino, stating that the girl “is showing signs of improvement”, adding: “Her recovery is hopeful, but the road will be long.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

I will consider further steps carefully in light of the findings.”Hodge, 80, wasnamed the UK’s anti-corruption champion in December last yearin recognition of her record in combating illicit finance and advocating for transparency in Britain’s offshore financial havens in particular. Hodge, who hasheld six ministerial posts, was the Labour MP for Barking in east London from 1994 until she stood down before the general election last year.David Lammy, the foreign secretary, has vowed to lift the veil of corporate secrecy that allows people to disguise their business dealings in jurisdictions such as the BVIs.Successive governmentshave been pushing overseas territories, and a separate group of crown dependencies, such as Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, to introduce fully publicly accessible registers of beneficial ownership (Parbos).At a meeting in London last November, five overseas territories, including the BVIs, promised to introduce legitimate interest access registers of beneficial interests (Liarbos) as a prelude to further steps.A spokesperson for the BVIs’ government said: “We continue to collaborate closely with international partners, including the UK government, working together to uphold high standards and protect our financial system.“This week’s productive talks in London between premier Natalio Wheatley and minister Stephen Doughty reflect our shared commitment to strengthening governance and democracy in the Virgin Islands. We look forward to building on this cooperation in a spirit of mutual respect.”The Guardian has approached Hodge for comment.Explore more on these topicsBritish Virgin IslandsTax havensTax avoidanceForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But the 51-year-old teacher wasn’t there to marvel over fog-filled London landscapes at Masp’s new Monet retrospective. She had come to join a protest heaping scorn onDonald Trump.Beneath the museum’s brutalist hulk, Marques spotted a cardboard effigy of the US president and took a picture with her phone before the Trump dummy was set on fire. “Laranjão safado,” which translates as big orange dirtbag, she wrote under her photo on Instagram. Nearby, demonstrators hoisted a red banner into the air which read: “Nice try Trump. But we’re not afraid.”The rally was a response to Trump’s decision last week to launch a politically motivated trade war against South America’s biggest economy in an attempt to help his rightwing ally, the former Brazilian presidentJair Bolsonaro, avoid jail.Bolsonaro could face up to 43 years in prison if found guilty of masterminding a botched coup attempt after losing the 2022 presidential election. He is expected to be convicted and sentenced by the supreme court in the coming weeks.On 9 July, Trump wrote to Brazil’s leftwing president,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, to demand that the charges against Bolsonaro be dropped and announce he would impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports until they were. “[This] is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!” thundered Trump, long Bolsonaro’s most important international backer.The US president apparently expected his intervention to improve the outlook for Bolsonaro, 70, who is already banned from running in next year’s election. Bolsonaro’s senator son, Flávio, urged Lula’s administration to immediately cave in to Trump’s ultimatum by offering his father an amnesty from prosecution. Flávio Bolsonaro likened Brazil’s predicament to Japan’s at the end of the second world war when the US’s B-29 bombers blasted it into submission. “It’s up to us to show the responsibility to avoid two atomic bombs landing onBrazil,” he said.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro in March 2020.Photograph: Alan Santos/Brazilian presidency/EPABut a week after Trump’s tariff announcement, the ploy seems to be backfiring badly. The move has reinvigorated Bolsonaro’s leftwing rivals, given Lula a bounce in the polls and prompted a wave of public anger, largely focused on the Bolsonaro clan who have spent years portraying themselves as flag-loving nationalists.“Jair Bolsonaro couldn’t care less about Brazil. He’s a phoney patriot,” the conservative Estado de São Paulo newspaper fumedon Tuesday, excoriating the ex-president’s apparent willingness to throw his country to the wolves if it meant saving his own skin.The newspaper’s editorial board instructed conservatives to pick their side: “Brazil’s or Bolsonaro’s. The two paths are diametrically opposed.”Eliane Cantanhêde, a columnist for the Estado de São Paulo, saw three motives behind Trump’s “indecent proposal”. He hoped to boost far-right fellow travellers in South America; retaliate against Chinese involvement in the region after the recent Brics summit in Rio; and do a personal favour to Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo, who has spent recent months lobbying officials in Washington after going into self-imposed exile in the US.But Cantanhêde believed Trump’s “megalomaniac” move had boomeranged, handing Lula a golden opportunity to recover slumping public support by posing as a nationalist defender of Brazilian coffee producers, orange growers,cattle ranchers and plane manufacturers in the face of Bolsonaro’s anti-patriotic and self-serving sellout to Trump.“Lula was on the ropes,” Cantanhêde said, highlighting the leftist’s falling ratings and growing doubts over his ability to win a fourth term next year. “Now he’s all smiles.”She said Beijing – Brazil’s biggest trade partner – would also be celebrating as Washington further damaged its standing in the region. “Trump is pushing the whole world into China’s lap,” Cantanhêde said.Nicolás Saldías, a Latin America analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, agreed Trump’s pro-Bolsonaro intercession was a boon for Lula, who has taken to wearing a blue cap bearing the slogan “Brazil belongs to the Brazilians”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He suspected Trump’s trade war on Brazil would have a similar “rally around the flag” impact for Lula – in the short-term, at least.“For Lula this is going to be helpful,” Saldías said, noting how his ratings had already risen and looked likely to rise further. “This changes the game because now he’s going to be seen as the defender of Brazilian nationalism, a kind of progressive nationalism.”Having spent months dreaming that Trump may help save their leader from prison, the Bolsonaros appear to recognise they have scored an own goal. One source close to the ex-president’s family told Reuters: “The thrill of catching Trump’s attention soon curdled as the Bolsonaros realised the crushing weight of the tariffs tied to their cause.”On Tuesday, Bolsonaroinsistedhe opposed the tariffs, which he blamed on Lula’s “provocation” of the US, and claimed he could fix at least part of the problem if given “the freedom to talk to Trump”.Silvana Marques, the protesting teacher, was adamant the Brazilian authorities should not yield to “crazy” Trump’s demands and let Bolsonaro off the hook. “We cannot allow this to happen,” she said, remembering the dire consequences of failing to prosecute the military leaders behind Brazil’s 1964-85 dictatorship.Like many Brazilians, Marques took a dim view of how – as she saw it – the Bolsonaros had encouraged Trump to wage economic war against their own country.“They’re a family of traitors,” she said. “And the Americans must be thinking: are we really going to have to pay 50% more for the things we import from Brazil just to defend this worn-out old horse?”Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaTrump administrationDonald TrumpAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

China’s envoy in Canberra even took the extraordinary step of issuinga list of 14 grievanceswith Australia.Xi says Australia and China should ‘unswervingly’ work together despite global instabilityRead moreLabor’s efforts in its first term to calm tensions and foster cooperation are clearly paying dividends.Speaking at the start of his talks with Albanese in the Great Hall of the People, Xi praised an ongoing common understanding, even as the US president, Donald Trump, wreaks havoc with the international trade system and senior Pentagon figurespush Australia to explainhow we would respond to a conflict between China and Taiwan.“No matter how the international landscape may evolve, we should uphold this overall direction unswervingly,” Xi told Albanese, who responded that close ties had already produced “very positive benefits” for both sides.Local state-controlled media buzzed about the visit, praising the “turnaround” and suggesting China-Australia relations were on track to “cruise steadilyin the ‘stratosphere’”. Greater numbers of Chinese tourists are expected and the chair of the National People’s Congress will lead a delegation to Australia soon.Albanese managed to walk a tightrope of expectations in the meeting at the Great Hall of the People, raising the case of detainedChinese Australian academic Yang Hengjun, while avoiding frustrations about Australia’s foreign investment controls and the government’s determination to bring the Port of Darwin back into Australian control.We learned on Wednesday that these more difficult issues were raised after Albanese met Xi, during his lengthy talks with China’s premier, Li Qiang.Li complained Chinese businesses were facing unfair scrutiny under Labor’s changes to Foreign Investment Review Board approval rules, and that there was no reason for Chinese-owned infrastructure operator Landbridge to be stripped ofits 99-year lease to control the Darwin port.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The academy describes FSR as “the only English quarterly journal in the field of forensic science inChinathat focuses on forensic medicine”. It has been published by OUP since 2023.Several papers published in FSR have attracted criticism because they study genetic data fromUyghursand other heavily surveilled ethnic minorities in China. Critics say subjects in the studies may not have freely consented to their DNA samples being used in the research and that the studies could help to enhance the mass surveillance of those populations.Onestudy, published in 2020, analysed blood samples from 264 Uyghurs in Ürümqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region in north-west China. The paper states that the people giving the samples consented to the research and that their data was anonymised.The lead author on the study is affiliated with China’s state security apparatus via the Xinjiang Police College, which provided a research grant.In 2024, OUP published an “expression of concern” about the article, responding to questions about whether or notUyghursin Xinjiang could freely refuse to participate in a study conducted by representatives of China’s state security. The paper has not been retracted.Two other papers published in FSR based on DNA samples from Chinese populations have been retracted by OUP since 2023 because of ethical concerns. In both cases, several of the researchers came from Chinese police authorities.Forensic science research is often carried out under the auspices of police authorities, but in China, where there the state security apparatus is not subject to checks and balances, there is concern this kind of research may not meet international ethical standards.Uyghurs in Xinjiang are subject to intense surveillance by state authorities and between 2016 and 2018 about a million of them are estimated to have been detained in what China calls “vocational training centres”. The UN said China’s policies in Xinjiang could constitute crimes against humanity. There are also reports of Xinjiang authorities collecting DNA samples from millions of Uyghurs under the guise of health checks, but which Uyghurs and human rights groups have said are compulsory and designed to enhance surveillance.Yves Moreau, a professor of engineering at the University of Leuven in Belgium who focuses on DNA analysis, first raised concerns about OUP’s relationship with FSR and about several studies. He said he was grateful for OUP’s decision but that the brief public statement on the matter “fails to address the important issues at stake”.A statement published on FSR’s website, which is hosted by OUP, said: “Forensic Sciences Research will no longer be published by Oxford University Press (OUP) after the 2025 volume. The last issue published by OUP will be Volume 10, Issue 4.”OUP acquired the journal in 2023. Under the terms of the publishing agreement between OUP and the Academy of Forensic Sciences, a copy of which was seen by the Guardian, the deal gave OUP the right to solicit paid advertisers in the pages of the journal. The agreement also gives OUP the right to collect any revenues received by the Academy of Forensic Sciences related to the journal.OUP declined to elaborate on why it was ending the relationship with FSR.In recent years there has been increasing scrutiny about the ethical standards of genetic research papers from China. Last year, a genetics journal from a leading scientific publisherretracted 18 papersfrom China due to concerns about human rights.The concerns centre on whether or not vulnerable populations in China can freely refuse to participate, especially when researchers come from organisations, such as the police, affiliated with state security. There are also concerns that this kind of forensic DNA sampling could produce research that enhances the mass surveillance of those populations.Moreau said: “Forensic genetics is an area where specific caution is needed because this is the research that powers police DNA identification and databases. While DNA identification is a valuable technique to help solve crimes, it can raise privacy and ethical issues.” He added that the mass surveillance of minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet made China a particularly challenging country to enforce international norms about ethical research and human rights.FSR’s launch in 2016 was accompanied by an editorial that stated it is sponsored by an affiliate of China’s Ministry of Justice. Duarte Nuno Vieira, the co-editor-in-chief of FSR, has previously denied financial support from China’s Ministry of Justice had any impact on the journal’s editorial policies.Nuno Vieira did not respond to a request for comment. But in an article published on Tuesday, the FSR editors wrote that the journal was at “a moment of transformation, firmly rooted in its past successes, and yet reaching with confident hands towards an even more luminous future”. The publication of the journal will be taken over by KeAi, a China-based joint venture run by the Dutch scientific publisher Elsevier and a Chinese partner.China’s Ministry of Justice and the Academy of Forensic Sciences did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsScienceChinaAsia PacificAcademicsUniversity of OxfordHigher educationForensic sciencenewsShareReuse this content"

A rifle believed to belong to the missing man was found on the side of a mountain road, and bloodstains were discovered nearby. A large brown bear was seen near the road on Saturday.Runaway bear in runway ‘stalemate’ with Japanese airport officialsRead moreAlso on Saturday, a newspaper delivery man was fatally mauled in the town of Fukushima, about 120km away.Kenju Sato, 52, was repeatedly bitten by a bear and dragged about 100 metres into bushes, where his body was found a few hours later. Neighbours who heard his cries attempted unsuccessfully to scare the creature off.Local authorities declared a month-long brown bear emergency for the town, the first of its kind to be issued, with police, fire fighters and hunters running patrols 24 hours a day. The bear in Fukushima was reported to be about 1.5 metres in length, smaller than the one spotted around Mt. Esan.Multiple bear attacks have also been reported in Japan’s main island of Honshu this month.An 81-year-old woman was killed on 4 July by a black bear in Iwate prefecture in northeast Japan while two elderly women were attacked in separate incidents on Tuesday morning, one in the northern Aomori prefecture and the other near the ancient capital of Nara, hundreds of kilometres to the south.Experts have attributed therise in attacksin recent years to ascarcity of acorns and other staples of the ursine diet– a problem some experts have attributed to the climate crisis. They have also been encouraged to travel further afield by depopulation in rural communities and the resulting increase in abandoned farmland.After a record 219 injuries and fatalities in the previous fiscal year, serious incidents fell sharply in the year to March 2025, possibly due to food being more plentiful than in previous years.However, a recent report by Tohoku’s regional forest office, which covers five northern prefectures, has predicted an extremely poor harvest of beechnuts, a staple bear food, this autumn, raising fears that hunger will drive more of the animals into residential areas in search of nourishment.Authorities are urging residents in the region not to dispose of food waste outside their homes to avoid attracting the creatures.Hokkaido’s Ussuri brown bears can grow up to 3 metres and exceed 500kg. The Asiatic black bears found elsewhere in Japan are rarely larger than 1.5 metres and 150kg but can still kill humans.In response to the increasing numbers of bear encounters in residential areas, the government in Aprilrelaxed its strict hunting lawsto allow bears to be shot in urban areas, allowing municipalities to authorise “emergency shootings” if there is a threat to human life.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Malaysia “should not be treated as a dumping ground for ideological firebrands and partisan influencers,” Zaid said, adding that Adams’ nomination “would not be a gesture of goodwill-it would be an insult.”Transport minister Anthony Loke, who is the secretary-general of DAP, a member of the national unity government, will also oppose Adams’ appointment, according to local media, which reported his party planned to issue a statement on the matter.Adams, 40, who was born in Australia but obtained US citizenship in 2021, will need to be confirmed by the US Senate before he can assume the role. He said on social media last week it was “nothing short of a lifetime’s honour to take the president’s goodwill and spread it to the great people of Malaysia”.He looked forward to strengthening ties between the two countries, he said, telling Malaysians he could not wait “to experience your noble culture and learn much from you”.Adams’ comments about Israel have provoked particular concern in Malaysia, a staunch supporter of Palestine, which does not have diplomatic relations with Israel.In a post shared on X in 2024,Adams stated: “If you don’t stand with Israel, you stand with terrorists!”Another comment allegedly written by Adams on X in 2024, in which he claimed to have ensured a waitress was fired for wearing a “Free Palestine” pin, has been widely cited by pro-Palestine groups and youth leaders opposing his appointment. The post cannot be found on X.A youth leader with the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), Sukri Omar, said the Malaysian government should “send a clear message that Malaysia will not be a stage for normalising Zionist tyranny …”Adams, and the US embassy in Kuala Lumpur, did not respond to a request for comment regarding the cited post, or criticism over his appointment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is significantly below the 32% level the president earlier threatened.“As part of the Agreement, Indonesia has committed to purchasing $15 Billion Dollars in US Energy, $4.5 Billion Dollars in American Agricultural Products, and 50 Boeing Jets, many of them 777’s,” Trump wrote.Boeing shares closed down 0.2% after the announcement.Japan walks line between recession and submission as it seeks to overcome Trump tariffsRead more“They are going to pay 19% and we are going to pay nothing … we will have full access into Indonesia, and we have a couple of those deals that are going to be announced,” Trump said outside the Oval Office earlier.Indonesia’s total trade with the US – totalling just under $40bn in 2024 – does not rank in the top 15, but it has been growing. US exports to Indonesia rose 3.7% last year, while imports from there were up 4.8%, leaving the US with a goods trade deficit of nearly $18bn.The Trump administration has beenunder pressure to wrap up trade pactsafter promising a flurry of deals recently, as countries sought talks with Washington to avoid the US president’s tariff plans.But Trump has so far only unveiled otherdeals with BritainandVietnam, alongside an agreement to temporarily lower tit-for-tat levies with China.Last week, Trump renewed his threat of a 32% levy on Indonesian goods, saying in a letter to the country’s leadership that this would take effect 1 August.It remains unclear when the lower tariff level announced on Tuesday will take effect for Indonesia. The period over which its various purchases will take place was also not specified.Trump said on social media that under the deal, which was finalised after he spoke with Indonesian president Prabowo Subianto, goods that have been transshipped to avoid higher duties would face steeper levies.He separately told reporters that other deals were in the works, including with India, whiletalks with the European Unionare continuing.Indonesia’s former vice minister for foreign affairs, Dino Patti Djalal, told a Foreign Policy event Tuesday that government insiders had indicated they were happy with the new deal.Trump inApril imposed a 10% tariffon almost all trading partners, while announcing plans to eventually hike this level for dozens of economies, including the EU and Indonesia.But days before the steeper duties, customised to each economy, were due to take effect, he pushed the deadline back from 9 July to 1 August. This marked his second postponement of the elevated levies.Instead, since early last week, Trumphas been sending letters to partners, setting out the tariff levels they would face come August. So far, he has sent more than 20 such letters including to the EU, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia.Trump has unveiled blanket tariffs on trading partners in part to address what his administration deems as unfair practices that hurt US businesses.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsIndonesiaTariffsAsia PacificTrump administrationInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

I note concerns have been raised about the human rights implications of her recommendations. The Commission has requested a briefing from the Special Envoy to further discuss her proposed reforms and these implications.“The Commission will engage with Ms Segal as well as the Australian Government to provide expert advice on the human rights implications of Ms Segal’s proposals to ensure any measures under consideration don’t restrict fundamental rights and freedoms, such as freedom of expression and the independence of important institutions.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailSivaraman noted that some of Segal’s priorities aligned with the commission’s national anti-racism framework, including recommendations for reforms across Australia’s education, media and social media sectors.The framework, launched in November, stated “current approaches to anti-racism are ad-hoc, disjointed, and often ineffective”. Its overarching recommendations focused heavily on racism towards First Nations people.The framework recommended changing the Racial Discrimination Act so that employers and service providers needed to take active steps to prevent racial discrimination from happening in the first place.“This would be a significant reform that would address many concerns raised in the Envoy’s report,” he said.The day after the report was launched, Sivaraman said he would be “carefully considering” its contents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

UK officials say the new law, expected to be passed by the end of the year, will give police and prosecutors the tools to target warehouses and logistical hubs used to store small boats and engines linked to Channel crossings.Police will be able to raid warehouses, seize assets and arrest facilitators even where no migrants are present, a move the UK government says will significantly disrupt the supply chain behind dangerous Channel crossings.This is a relatively late first visit for a German chancellor to the UK. Merz took office in May but officials on both sides say the delay was deliberate.In his first week, Merz travelled to Kyiv with Starmer, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, in a show of European unity. London and Berlin agreed Merz’s visit should coincide with the signing of the treaty.It is expected to be focused on mutual security, including cyber and hybrid attacks, stating that “there is no strategic threat to one which would not be a strategic threat to the other”.A senior German official stressed the treaty is not intended to “replace” Nato guarantees or interfere with a future UK-EU security arrangement, but added that Brexit had left “gaps” in coordination that needed to be filled.The agreement will also reaffirm an earlier plan to co-develop long-range weapons systems – following the Trinity House agreement in December – and includes new measures to improve youth and academic mobility.A senior German official said: “We will enable visa-free school group travel between the UK andGermany, increasing opportunities for language, cultural and academic experiences. We will introduce the new programme by the end of 2025.”The official added that both governments would “convene a joint expert group” to explore broader mobility solutions for “educational and scientific institutions, cultural institutions and political organisations”. While the scheme could serve as a future model for EU-UK cooperation, the official confirmed it would apply only to Germany for now.While the war in Gaza is not on the formal agenda, officials said the fallout from Donald Trump’s latest remarks on Russia – delivered just hours before Merz’s departure – could surface in private discussions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the far-right AfD gaining traction, the visit provides an opportunity to portray competence and reinforce Germany’s industrial and security networks beyond the EU.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyEuropeKeir StarmerFriedrich MerzGermanyFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

They said several aggravating factors were at play during the attack, such as her feeling her cubs were threatened, protecting a nearby animal carcass, and the presence of a dog the victim had with him.“The bear in this case was behaving like a bear,” the campaigners argued in court.The environment agency said it had fulfilled all the legal requirements to order a cull and did not need to prove that the animal was more likely than other bears to attack humans. “With its behaviour, the bear has already shown that it poses a risk to human life and health,” it said.Hunter missing in Japan as spate of bear attacks triggers emergency to be declared in northern townRead moreThe court ruled in favour of the agency and agreed with the portrayal of the bear as not being timid. It noted that the attack took place about 300 metres away from the victim’s home, in an area with hiking trails.The agency said on Wednesday that the bear had not been seen on wildlife cameras in the area in the past week.Hilde Singsaas, the agency’s director, said: “The risk of new encounters between humans and the female in question is now significantly lower than when we decided to cull on 26 June. We will therefore not decide on any new cull now.”Europe’s appetite for killing big carnivores has increased in recent years aswolves eating farmers’ sheepand severalbear attacks on humanshave fuelled fury at rules to protect wildlife. Far-right parties across the continent have campaigned to weaken green rules in the face of threats from wild animals.In the Norwegian case, campaigners said environmental authorities painted a misleading picture of the bear. The bite had been widely reported as an unprovoked attack on a hiker, but a police report to the environment agency, reproduced in the court’s ruling on Tuesday, showed the victim had two hunting dogs when he first encountered the animal. He took one of the dogs home and returned with the other to follow the tracks he had spotted.Martinsen said: “The man who was injured was following the bear’s tracks on his own initiative with a hunting dog. That is exactly what you should not do with a bear and her cubs when they’re small.”She said the environment agency had failed to properly inform the public of the nature of the attack. The agency declined to comment on its characterisation of the attack.According to the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, bears in Scandinavia injure one person a year on average, and the “vast majority” of attacks happen while hunting.Campaigners welcomed the environment agency’s latest decision but criticised it for leaving the door open to kill the bear if it returns.Alette Sandvik, of Our Predators Association, said: “The suggestion that a new felling permit can be issued just because she is seen in the area is contrary to the terms of the law. This area is part of the natural habitat of the female, and it is not the case that females should be able to be shot just because you see them.”Explore more on these topicsNorwayWildlifeAnimalsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

So it’s very important to pay attention from the very beginning … [and] to mobilize.”Hungary, a European Union and Nato member, is often cited as an example of a formerly liberal democracy devolving into a competitive autocracy. Orbán – who has trumpeted his belief in “illiberal democracy” – has cemented his power over the courts, the media and universities during 15 years in office and four consecutive election victories.Addressing a webinar organized by the Center for American Progress, a Washington-based thinktank, Cseh warned US voters against believing their country was immune to such developments.“I do believe that many Americans think this is something that also only happens to others, and I think that mindset has to be fought,” she said.“Start preparing for the midterms like yesterday. Go to every protest, go to every march, stand right beside everybody who is being attacked, no matter if it is a group you belong to, or something that you do not share personally. You have to stand side by side [with] each other and help and support those who might feel isolated and alone.”She urgedDemocratsand activists to form a widely inclusive “movement” and find “candidates for the midterms or any election that is coming your way who can get people excited – not necessarily the same old faces they have been seeing all the time that they don’t really trust that much, but visionary leaders … who are part of a community, who are being persecuted.”Leaders such as Trump and Orbán could only be effectively opposed, she said, by ditching a “legalistic, technical, technocratic approach” in favor of “something for the electorate to be excited about”.“Autocrats are not always good in governing. So cost of living, crisis of healthcare, education – if the focus is shifted to these areas, and not only technical descriptions of what’s going on in the courts, this is something that people can relate to more.”The parallels with Hungary came as opinion polls show Orbán on course to lose next year’s general election to the opposition Tisza party, led by Péter Magyar, a former member of the prime minister’s party.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Previous such events have been attended by a few thousand LGBTQ+ activists.Szabolcs Panyi, a journalist with the Hungarian website Direkt36, said Trump’s approach to the media drew on a playbook used by Orbán, who deployed a range of measures to curtail journalists’ independence.These included banishing established outlets from briefings in favor of friendly journalists and “propagandists”, an approach emulated by the White House, which has excluded journalists from the Associated Press and invited representatives from rightwing organizations and social media influencers.“What particularly rings out is how certain large media outlets or owners or large conglomerates try to appeaseDonald Trumpby settling lawsuits or by firing journalists [or] editors,” he said. “It really resembles what happened in Hungary in the 2010s.”Paramount Global, the owners of CBS,reached a $16m settlementwith Trump this month after he lodged a $10bn suit over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, his 2024 Democratic presidential opponent. ABCagreed to payTrump $15m last December after he sued over an inaccurate characterization of his conviction over sexual assault allegations brought by the writer E Jean Carroll.Panyi said Trump’s attempts to slash funding for public broadcasters such as PBS and Voice of America were also inspired by Orbán.“[Orbán] went after public radio, public TV, and in a matter of a couple of months, it was already transformed into propaganda,” he said. “It’s scary to see similar things happening in the United States. Solidarity is especially important, so whenever there are similar things happening, there should be protests. Journalists should support their colleagues and tell readers that if it happens to one outlet, it can happen to others as well.”Ceylan Akçe, a member of Turkey’s pro-Kurdish People’s Equality and Democracy party, said more than two decades of rule under the country’s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had demonstrated that political opponents should not “wait for the storm to pass”.“It’s going to continue to rain,” she said. “If you wait for it to stop, it won’t, and while you’re in the eye of the storm, you have to continue to mobilize and never be discouraged.”Tamara Tripic, an opposition parliamentarian in Serbia, whereAleksandar Vučić, the president, is accused of instituting an autocracy that has provoked waves of opposition protests, warned that modern authoritarians camouflaged their actions behind a cloak of legality.“We have to be aware that they are using [tools that] are usually legal but misused, institutional but hollowed out, democratic in appearance but authoritarian in essence,” she said. “It doesn’t look like dictatorship, but it’s functioning like one. Our problem, especially if you are progressive, is that … usually people are afraid of the freedom we are offering. They are willing to trade some … freedom for the illusion of order, identity and security.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationViktor OrbánDonald TrumpHungaryDemocratsUS politicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Almost all of the homes in the village have since been sold to the state, and most of the residents have left.Volcanoes on the Reykjanes peninsula had not erupted for eight centuries when a period of heightened seismic activity began in March 2021.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The strikes killed one person and injured 18, Syrian officials said.It was the first time Israel had targeted Damascus since May and the third day in a row it had conducted airstrikes against the Syrian military.A spokesperson for the Israeli military said the strike on the defence ministry had been a message to the Syrian president, Ahmed al-Sharaa “regarding the events in Sweida”. The Israeli military struck Syrian tanks on Monday and has continued to conduct dozens of drone strikes on troops, killing some soldiers.Israel has said it will not allow the Syrian army to deploy in the south of the country, and that it would protect the Druze community from the Damascus government. Many in the Druze community have rebuffed Israel’s claim of patronage for fear of being viewed as a foreign proxy.The Israeli bombing added another complication to an already escalating conflict between Syrian government forces, Bedouin Arab tribes and Druze fighters. More than 250people have been killed in four days of clashes, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).On Wednesday, the Syrian government and one of the three spiritual leaders of the Syrian Druze community announced a ceasefire. It was unclear if the truce would hold, however, as another spiritual leader, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, vowed to keep fighting, calling the government a collection of “armed gangs”.A ceasefire announced on Tuesday broke down in similar circumstances.On Wednesday night, Reuters reported that the UN security council would meet on Thursday to discuss the situation.The clashes pitting mostly Sunni government forces against Druze fighters have prompted fears of a wider sectarian conflict. An attack in March by remnants of the ousted regime of Bashar al-Assad on security forces led to violence in which more than 1,500 people were killed, most of them from the minority Alawite community.The violence is the most serious challenge to Damascus’s rule since the coastal massacres and has threatened to further push away everyday Druze from the state.The Druze, a religious minority in Syria and the wider Middle East, make up the majority of the population of Sweida province in the south of the country. They have been negotiating with the Islamist-led authorities in Damascus since the fall of Assad, in an attempt to achieve some form of autonomy. They have yet to reach an agreement that defines their relationship with the new Syrian state.View image in fullscreenSyrian security forces deploy during clashes in Sweida city on Wednesday.Photograph: Sam Hariri/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Syrian army entered Sweida on Sunday in an attempt to restore calm between Druze fighters and Arab Bedouin tribes.Fighting broke out after Bedouin tribe members robbed a Druze man on the main road south of Damascus, kicking off a cycle of retaliatory violence between the two groups. Intermittent violence between members of the Druze and Bedouin communities has been common in the area in recent years.Some Druze militias have vowed to prevent Syrian government forces entering Sweida and have attacked them, leading to escalating clashes.As government forces entered Sweida, accounts of human rights abuses began to emerge.On Tuesday around noon, armed gunmen entered a reception hall belonging to the Radwan family in Sweida and killed 15 unarmed men and one woman, three members of the family told the Guardian. The SOHR also reported the killings, though put the number of dead at 12.“I just lost nine close friends and relatives. It just makes me feel so sad. There are no weapons allowed in the [hall], it’s not like it’s a military base,” said Maan Radwan, a 46-year-old London resident whose relatives were killed in the shooting.Video of the aftermath of the shooting showed unarmed men strewn across a room lying in pools of blood. Family members said men in army fatigues prevented ambulances from reaching the reception hall, which they thought was meant to ensure the wounded died from blood loss.“We don’t know who is with general security, who are jihadists, who are Bedouin tribespeople. It’s impossible to tell who is killing us,” a 52-year old teacher and relative of the Radwan family in Sweida told the Guardian by phone.A surgeon at the Sweida national hospital said that the bodies of those killed in the Radwan house bore close-range gunshot wounds, adding that they knew many of those who were killed in the shootings personally.Sharaa issued a statement on Wednesday condemning the human rights violations.“These criminal and illegal actions cannot be accepted under any circumstances and completely contradict the principles that the Syrian state is built on,” the statement said, adding that perpetrators would be held accountable.The US special envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack, posted on X saying: “Actions must follow to end violence, ensure accountability and protect all Syrians.”It was unclear who was committing the abuses against civilians, and witnesses said they could not distinguish between state security forces and militia fighters.On their private social media, two members of the government forces posted sectarian hate speech against Druze.One member of the government forces posted a video of him and two other soldiers driving through Sweida laughing as he said: “We are on our way to distribute aid,” while brandishing a machete to the camera. He filmed himself inside a house in Sweida ripping a picture of Druze spiritual leaders off a wall and trampling it with his boots.“If God grants you victory, none can defeat you. We are coming for you with sectarianism,” he continued.The Syrian defence ministry said it was “adhering to rules of engagement to protect residents”.Several civilians in Sweida city described being locked inside their home as fighting continued outside, while electricity and other basic supplies have been cut off.One 52-year-old English teacher said they had watched as their neighbour was shot dead by a hidden sniper, and that no one could collect the body for fear of being shot.A 31-year-old resident of Sweida said he watched as armed men burned the shop below his house, calling the Druze “swine” as they ransacked the neighbouring building.The Syrian interior ministry said the continued fighting could only be solved by integrating the Druze-majority province into the state and said it came “in the absence of relevant official institutions”.The killings in Sweida provoked anger among the wider Druze community in the Middle East. Some Israeli Druze in the occupied Golan Heights managed to cross the fence into Syria before being retrieved by the Israeli army. The Israeli military also said that it had reinforced its presence along the Syria-Israel border.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Israeli Druze community gather at the border fence separating the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights and Syria.Photograph: Léo Corrêa/APThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, issued a statement urging people not to try to cross the border into Syria.“Do not cross the border. You are risking your lives; you could be murdered, you could be taken hostage, and you are impeding the efforts of the IDF,” he said.Relations between Israel and Syria had begun to thaw before this week, with Israeli and Syrian officials engaging in security discussions and military coordination. Syria’s leadership has hinted it could eventually normalise relations with its southern neighbour.After the fall of Assad, the Israeli military launched hundreds of airstrikes against military assets in Syria and invaded the country’s south, where it continues to occupy large swathes of territory.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It happened after GHF guards used teargas or pepper spray on hungry crowds arriving at the centre, Palestinian health authorities and witnesses said.Nineteen people were crushed and one stabbed in a “chaotic and dangerous surge” on Wednesday morning, GHF said in a statement. It did not respond to questions about the use of pepper spray or teargas by its staff at the site near Khan Younis.Fifteen people died from suffocation after teargas was fired at the crowd, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement.“All of the 15 arrived at the hospital already dead with obvious symptoms of lack of oxygen. You can see blue marks, vomit, blue lips, swelling faces – all symptoms of suffocation,” Dr Mohammed Zaqqout, the director of hospitals for Gaza, said. “We couldn’t save any of the 15 we received because they were already dead on arrival.”Abdel Ghani Rouqa’s 20-year-old nephew, Mohammad, was among the dead.“The tents are completely empty now, lacking any food or drink, so people, with no other options or alternatives, are forced to go to dangerous areas just to get a can of fava beans or hummus, or even a few kilograms of flour, anything to feed their hungry families,” Rouqa said.“Unfortunately, when Mohammad went there today, the place was extremely crowded. The Israeli army had narrowed the area and created some passages for people to walk through,” he added.“What happened today was that, with the army firing teargas canisters at the densely packed crowd in front of the aid distribution gates, panic broke out. People started pushing and rushing to flee the area.”“Mohammad fell to the ground and couldn’t get up or escape. As the panicked crowd fled, they stepped on him, some on his stomach or back, some on his head, and others on his legs until he lost his life,” his uncle said. “The main cause of the chaos and deaths of more than 20 people was the firing of gas bombs.”GHF rejected the accounts provided by relatives and the Gaza health authorities and instead blamed the incident on Hamas.Chapin Fay, a GHF spokesperson, said: “Make no mistake, this tragic incident was no accident. This was a calculated provocation, part of a pattern of targeted efforts by Hamas and its allies to dismantle our life-saving operations.“GHF personnel identified a large number of people within the crowd carrying pistols. One American GHF worker, a medical professional, was targeted by a suspected Hamas affiliate with a pistol.“The medic attempted to tackle him, but in the process, the Hamas affiliate fled the site, and the medic was stabbed by another Hamas affiliate with an ice pick-like weapon.”Fay said no teargas was deployed, but pepper spray was used, “only to protect against additional loss of life”.He added that warning shots were fired in the air to disperse the crowd when a GHF worker saw a child in danger of being crushed, and that the GHF worker was able to save the child.In an earlier statement, GHF said that the trampling deaths were “the result of a surge instigated by armed Hamas agitators who infiltrated the crowd”.Fay said 19 people had been trampled to death, and another died from stab wounds.“The 19 victims who were trampled likely died due to compressive asphyxia, otherwise known as suffocation, which is the leading cause of death in these types of incidents,” he said in an online briefing.The deaths marked a grim milestone for Palestinians in a war where Israeli attacks have already killed more than 58,000 people, the majority of them civilians. On Tuesday 13 members of the same family, including seven children, were reported killed when an Israeli airstrike hit their home in eastern Gaza City. Some of the victims were left to die under the rubble, as the Israeli military prevented rescuers from approaching the scene for roughly eight hours with the use of drone strikes, local rescue workers and family memberstold the Haaretz newspaper.Israeli forces have killed at least 800 Palestinians while they were trying to access food since the GHF began operations in late May. Many of them were trying to reach a GHF distribution site. The deaths on Wednesday were the first at a site controlled by the organisation’s armed security guards. Gaza health authorities also said they were the first “due to suffocation and severe stampedes”.GHF, a startup organisation with no experience of distributing food in complex conflict zones, says it bears no responsibility for deaths outside its perimeters. The Trump administration announced on Tuesday it would donate $30m (£22m) to the organisation, a move decried as “outrageous” by the Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen.Van Hollen referred to GHF as a “shadowy group at the centre of the scheme to replace humanitarian aid orgs in Gaza with mercenaries, leading to the killing of starving civilians trying to collect food”.“Taxpayers shouldn’t be paying for this outrage,” the senator said in asocial media post.GHF runs only four sites to feed 2 million people, in a territory where extreme hunger is widespread and food security experts have warned of looming famine. Food security experts say deaths are inevitable in a system with only four sites, which open for short, irregular periods, providing food for hundreds of thousands of desperately hungry people.Under the aid model run by the UN and major international humanitarian organisations, which fed Palestinians during nearly 20 months of war, there were more than 400 aid distribution points used to bring food into communities.Israeli authorities claimed they needed a new aid system because Hamas was diverting aid, but have not provided evidence to back up allegations that closely audited supply chains of UN and humanitarian agencies were compromised.William Christou in Beirut contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

According to several diplomatic sources she did not endorse any one of10 sanctions optionsdrawn up by her team, after an earlier EU review found“indications” Israel was in breach of human rights commitments.Kallas said Israel needed to “take more concrete steps to improve the humanitarian situation on the ground”, which earlier in the day she had described as catastrophic. She was meeting EU foreign affairs ministers days after announcing a potentially significant agreement with Israel to increase the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza, where2.1 million people face famineand drought caused by the collapse of water systems.At least 20 killed in crush at Gaza aid point – Middle East crisis liveRead moreEU sources say the flow of aid into the territory has increased to about 80 trucks a day, but distribution remains problematic. With no clear signs that new aid inflows were reaching people over the weekend, Palestinians havecontinued to risk their lives queueing for food and waterat sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-backed logistics group. Officials iin Gazareported that in one 24-hour period over the weekend, 139 people were killed, including women and children queueing for food. The UN said about 850 Palestinians in the enclave had been killed while waiting to receive aid since May, both at GHF distribution points and elsewhere.Ministers were not expected to endorse any of the 10 sanctions options, which include full suspension of the EU-Israel association agreement, a trade and cooperation deal. Suspending this deal is widely seen as a non-starter as it requires unanimous support of member states.Israel’s closest EU allies – Germany, Hungary and the Czech Republic – oppose sanctions, especially now Israel has struck the humanitarian deal with the EU. Hungary also continues to veto EU sanctions on violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank.Even countries strongly supportive of the Palestinian cause, such as Ireland, have not called for any specific measures, but await proposals from Kallas. Only Spain has come out clearly for a suspension of the association agreement.Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said refusal to suspend the agreement with Israel “is a cruel and unlawful betrayal of the European project and vision, predicated on upholding international law and fighting authoritarian practices, of the European Union’s own rules and of the human rights of Palestinians”.She added: “This will be remembered as one of the most disgraceful moments in the EU’s history.”Claudio Francavilla, the acting EU director of Human Rights Watch in Brussels, said: “Once again, EU ministers have failed. Not enough support for any measure to hold Israel to account, traded away for the illusory promise of a few more trucks.”Earlier in the day, Kallas said there were positive signs on border crossings, arrival of humanitarian aid trucks, reconstruction of electricity lines and water, but “of course we need to see more in order to see real improvement for the people on the ground”. She said the EU would keep a “close watch” on how the agreement was implemented, with updates to European diplomats once a fortnight.According to the EU, the agreement with Israel means “the substantial increase of daily trucks for food and non-food items to enter Gaza” among other measures, including the repair of power supplies to Gaza’s critical water desalination facility.Kallas said member states had a discussion on the options paper, but she did not take ownership of any proposal. “These are the choices that member states have to make,” she told reporters. “We will keep these options on the table and stand ready to act if Israel does not live up to its pledges. The aim is not to punish Israel. The aim is to improve the situation in Gaza.”Speaking on Monday, Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, expressed confidence the EU would not take any action, saying: “There’s no justification whatsoever.”Hadja Lahbib, the EU commissioner for humanitarian aid, struck a more urgent tone, saying it was clear the agreement was not yet fully implemented: “My message to the Israeli authorities is very clear. Put this agreement into action now. Stop killing the people. We need humanitarian aid: food, water, fuel to reach the people in need.”Lahbib, who briefed ministers about the aid deal, added that “it was important to know what we can do if the agreement is not fully implemented” and that the situation would need to have improved before the next formal gathering of foreign ministers in October. “Every minute lost is a life lost,” she said.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warEuropean UnionEuropeGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Many of the arms dealers sold what appeared to be US-produced weapons, some emblazoned with “Property of US Govt”, as well as other western military weapons that were stamped with “Nato”.The report does not specify the arms dealers’ customers but given the high price of the weapons, with some rifles being sold for as much as $10,000 (£7,500), it is likely buyers could be other militants.X andMetaprohibit arms dealing on their platforms. Many of the arms dealers were subscribers to X Premium and users of WhatsApp Business – services that are supposed to be moderated.View image in fullscreenAn arms dealer using a WhatsApp Business account to sell a golden Glock handgun wrapped in a skin showing an American colonial soldier and the words ‘Preserve, Protect, Defend’.Photograph: Tech Transparency ProjectKatie Paul, the director of TTP, said: “X and WhatsApp both have policies against weapons sales but they are allowing arms traders linked to a US-designated terrorist group to traffic weapons on their platforms. In some cases these companies may be profiting off violations of their own policies that create risks for US national security.”More than half of the X accounts listed their location as Sana’a, the Houthi-controlled capital of Yemen, and many regularly shared pro-Houthi content. Others sold weapons in containers marked with the Houthi logo, which states “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse be upon the Jews, victory to Islam”.Several accounts identified by TTP were subscribed to X Premium, which allowed them to post extended videos. One account featured an “unboxing” video of an American M249 SAW, a light machine gun used by the US military. Other accounts used the tip feature, which allows X users to directly send donations to them.X prohibits the use of its platforms by individuals who “promote [terrorist organisations’] illicit activities”, and says it does not allow terrorist groups to use its premium services.View image in fullscreenAn arms dealer on X advertises a weapon in a gun case which bears the logo of the Houthis.Photograph: Tech Transparency ProjectAdverts appeared in the comments of posts selling weapons, suggesting X could be making money off the posts. In one instance, X placed an ad for a company selling Tesla accessories under a post where an arms dealer offered an “all-American” Glock 17 handgun.After Elon Musk bought X in 2022, he laid off about 80% of the company’s trust and safety team, which was dedicated to content moderation. A previous report by TTP found that more than 200 accounts affiliated with terrorist and other sanctioned groups had blue ticks and were subscribed to X Premium.A few of the Houthi-linked arms dealers interacted with Musk himself on X. When Musk posted a video of himself firing a Barret .50-caliber sniper rifle in September 2023, three arms dealers replied to him advertising their own guns, which included two AR-15s.X declined to comment on the findings of TTP’s investigation when approached by the Guardian.Many of the arms dealers also used WhatsApp business accounts with the “catalogue” feature, which allows a slideshow of products to be displayed, to showcase a catalogue of weapons.One such account offered dozens of guns, including a Glock pistol wrapped in a custom skin showing images of the Lincoln Memorial, the White House and an American colonial-era soldier with the words “Preserve, Protect, Defend” written on it.WhatsApp says it reviews business account profiles and checks images before they are added to catalogues. It is unclear why the review process missed the images and accounts, many of which clearly identify themselves as arms dealers and link to Yemeni bricks-and-mortar gun shops in their biographies.A spokesperson for WhatsApp said: “If we identify or are made aware of US-designated terrorist organisations attempting to use our service, we will take appropriate action – including banning accounts – to comply with our legal obligations.”WhatsApp then banned two accounts sent by the Guardian. It clarified that it did not make profit from the type of accounts in question, but it did not otherwise reply to questions as to how the company’s review processes initially missed the arms dealers’ accounts.Meta has laid off thousands of employees in the last two years, many dedicated to safety. In January, Metavowedto roll back content moderation, in what seemed to be an acknowledgment of Donald Trump’s complaints of censorship on social media platforms.TTP found that the vast majority of the Houthi-affiliated arms dealers’ accounts on X and WhatsApp were created after the layoffs at both companies.Paul said: “Both Meta and X have the capital, the tools and the human resources to address this problem, but they’re not doing so.”Besides content moderation issues, TTP’s findings also raised questions about global arms smuggling.Taimur Khan, the head of Gulf regional operations at Conflict Armament Research, said tracing exactly how US-made weapons got to Houthi-held territory was difficult and there were several possible explanations.Some of the weapons, particularly the American M4 rifles, were possibly from stocks supplied to Yemeni government forces before 2014 that were seized by the Houthis when they launched their insurgency.Khan said other US weapons being sold by the accounts appeared “to have been diverted more recently” and were made for civilian customers rather than soldiers. Those weapons could have been trafficked from the US to Yemen through the Gulf and elsewhere in the regionor by other means, he added.Non-American weapons are also smuggled into Yemen along other regional trafficking routes. They are also supplied directly to the Houthis via their allies, such as Iran.Earlier this year, the US imposedsanctionson a Houthi arms smuggling network that was accused of procuring “tens of millions of dollars’” worth of Russian weapons with the assistance of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.“The arms that are being advertised in Houthi-controlled areas by weapon dealers, who are at some level linked to the Houthis, reflect all the different vectors of supply in Yemen,” Khan said.Explore more on these topicsHouthisYemenWhatsAppMetaXMiddle East and north AfricaInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s time policy caught up with this reality,” she said.About two-thirds of unpaid carers experienced material deprivation – defined as the inability to afford essential items such as food and energy – while carer social security benefits were often inadequate to protect family incomes, Resolution said.Despite UK family members effectively providing £184bn a year of unpaid care to loved ones, the value of carer’s allowance has fallen in the last two decades from 32% of full-time earnings at the minimum wage to just 19%, it found.Bringing the relative value of carer’s allowance back up to 1999 levels of 32% would boost the benefit by £53.45 a week to £136.75, at a cost of £2.9bn a year, the Resolution report said. An alternative would be to raise carer’s allowance rates in England and Wales to £94.60 a week, in line with the enhanced rates in place in Scotland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Employers should improve their retention of disabled staff and carers, and the government should raise the value of unpaid care in the benefits system and extend carers’ leave.”Emily Holzhausen, the director of policy and public affairs atCarersUK, said: “The evidence from the Resolution Foundation’s report adds even more impetus for change to improve carers’ benefits, especially after the scandal of overpayments of carer’s allowance and potential cuts to welfare benefits.”A government spokesperson said: “We understand the huge difference carers make, as well as the struggles so many face.“That’s why we have raised the carer’s allowance earnings threshold by £45 a week to £196, benefiting more than 60,000 carers by 2029-30.

However, there is currently no legislation that restricts the age at which you can buy nicotine pouches.The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) said the pouches currently fall between “regulatory gaps as they are not regulated as a specific tobacco or nicotine product”.Nicotine pouches, which contain nicotine, flavouring and sweeteners, are placed in the upper lip, allowing nicotine to be absorbed through the gum. Trading standards officers found they were in plain sight at checkout areas of many stores, with packaging and flavours similar to sweets and so made appealing to children, the CTSI said.According to a survey by Action on Smoking andHealth(Ash) carried out by YouGov, in 2024 only 38% of 11- to 17-year-olds were aware of nicotine pouches, rising to 43% this year.Duncan Stephenson, the policy and external affairs director at the CTSI, said the prominence of nicotine pouches “very much feels like a game of whack-a-mole”, because “just as one product is dealt with, another emerges.”Stephenson added: “While Trading Standards is working to ensure that the ban on single disposable vapes is in place, we are coming across new and emerging threats.“The availability of potentially harmful products being promoted and sold to our children seems never-ending. Nicotine pouches are the latest example, with slick marketing, sweet flavours and colourful packaging that risk appealing to young people, whether intended or not.“Local Trading Standards teams on the ground are uncovering these risks every day, but we urgently need the powers set out in the tobacco and vapes bill to take urgent and effective action. Strong, proactive regulation is essential to protect children and stop these products from slipping through the cracks.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s why we are taking action to close loopholes and strengthen donation rules, so the public can have confidence in the electoral process.”Under the plans, political parties will be required to assess companies they are receiving donations from against a series of tests, proving their connection to the UK or Ireland. Companies used for political donations will have to prove they are generating income in these countries.Currently, any UK company can make donations to a political party, regardless of when it was set up, where its money comes from and who its owners are.There will also be enhanced “know your donor” checks, meaning parties will have to consider the risk of any money coming from illegitimate sources. New guidance will be provided by theElectoral Commissionon conducting these risk assessments.The committee on standards in public life and the Electoral Commission have previously called for strengthened regulations and greater transparency in political donations.However, the new rules are expected to stop short of imposing caps on political donations.Some campaigners had called for more sweeping reforms after the US billionaire Elon Muskfloated the idea of giving $100m to Reform UK– an idea he now appears to have dropped after tensions with the party’s leader, Nigel Farage.He would not, as a foreign national, be able to donate and under the new rules and would have to prove any donation through a UK-based company had UK-generated revenue.The overhaul is also likely to stop short of a ban on donations in cryptocurrency, despite Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister and close ally of the prime minister, Keir Starmer, telling MPs on Monday he thought there was a case for doing so given how hard it was to trace their source.His comments come two months after Farage announced Reform would become the first party in British politics toaccept donations in bitcoin, mirroring a similar move by Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential election.The campaign group Spotlight on Corruption has warned the practicecould allow foreign countries to undermine British democracy, saying digital currencies “may play a role in future political interference schemes”.Government sources said on Tuesday the strengthening of general rules regarding foreign interference would also apply to digital currencies.A government source said: “Protecting our democracy from hostile foreign interference is a central responsibility of government and that’s why we are taking action to ensure it continues to thrive for generations to come.“We want as many people as possible to engage in our democracy with confidence in the electoral process and our forthcoming reforms will help us do that.”Alongside the political financing changes, the elections paper is also expected to back votes from the age of 16 and encourage more voter registration.Explore more on these topicsParty fundingElectoral CommissionElectoral reformnewsShareReuse this content"

Not the top-down approach of the state working alone. Not the transactional approach of markets left to their own devices. But a new way forward – where government and civil society work side by side to deliver real change.”The government has highlighted the covenant as a way of putting charities and social enterprises at the centre of plans to provide publicly funded grassroots services in areas such as domestic abuse, youth services and employment programmes.But the covenant is expected to addresses more fundamental principles of civil society independence and rights, and commits the government and charities to continue to engage respectfully even where they disagree on policy.A key passage in the covenant is expected to say the government respects the independence and legitimacy of civil society organisations to advocate and campaign, will protect their right to engage in peaceful protest, and hold the government to account.The commitment was welcomed by civil society leaders. Jane Ide, the chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, said: “This is an essential part of a healthy democracy and speaking truth to power is central to the role of civil society.”There is widespread optimism in the voluntary sector that the covenant, which was negotiated in recent months, signals a genuine attempt by the government to embrace civil society groups and draw on their expertise to drive social change.One senior voluntary sector figure said: “This is something everyone has wanted to see for some time. It is easy to be cynical about words on the page but it is a massive opportunity to do things in a different way.”There is broad relief the covenant appears to signal that the tide of aggressive criticism of charities from rightwing politicians in recent years, seen as an attempt to undermine charities’ legal rights and restrict their role in public debate, has receded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After the quake, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a tsunami warning, which it later downgraded to an advisory.The US Tsunami Center said the advisory was in effect from about 40 miles (64.4km) south-west of Homer to Unimak Pass, a distance of about 700 miles (1,126.5km). The area is sparsely populated – among the larger communities in the area is Kodiak, which is home to 5,200 people.Meanwhile, officials in the Pacific north-west were evaluating whether there was any threat to coastlines there.The first waves were projected to hit the village of Sand Point, a community of about 580 people on Popof Island, in the Aleutian chain. The first waves were projected to land there, but the state’s emergency management division said an hour after the quake that it had received no reports of damage.“We have seen other earthquakes in the area that have not generated significant tsunami waves, but we’re treating it seriously and going through our procedures, making sure communities are notified so they can activate their evacuation procedures,” spokesperson Jeremy Zidek said.In Unalaska, a fishing community of about 4,100 people, officials also urged people to move at least 50ft above sea level, one mile (1.6km) inland. In King Cove, which has about 870 residents on the south side of the Alaska Peninsula, officials sent an alert calling on those in the coastal area to move to higher ground.In a social media post, the Kodiak police department urged residents to utilize emergency shelters in the local elementary and high school “if you need to evacuate from the inundation zone”,the Anchorage Daily Newsreported.In a social media post, Washington Emergency Management wrote that “there is NO DANGER for Washington state from this earthquake in Alaska” after analyzing data from Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting ofTsunamis(Dart) buoys. Oahu Emergency Management added in a similar post that their is no threat to Hawaii either.Although Anchorage residents may have received an emergency alert, there is no threat to Alaska’s largest city, Anchorage Emergency Management wrote on social media.Explore more on these topicsAlaskaUS weatherExtreme weatherTsunamisEarthquakesnewsShareReuse this content"

Unless he has to leave for fraud,” said Trump. The president has recently criticized Powell for a$2.5bn renovationof the Fed’s buildings. “I mean it’s possible there’s fraud involved,” said Trump.Powell has reportedly asked the central bank’s inspector general toreviewthe renovation.Trump has repeatedly and publicly demanded the Fed cut interest rates to spur economic growth. Powell has so far declined, noting that Trump’s controversial rollout of tariffs has clouded the outlook for inflation.Trump takes on the Fed – but he has little power over central bank, economists sayRead moreIn an interview with the Real America’s Voice network aired on Wednesday, Trump said he would love for Powell to resign but acknowledged that many have said it would disrupt the markets if the president were to remove him, Reuters reported.People present at the meeting with Trump expressed approval for Powell’s firing, CBS Newsreported. The president indicated he would “likely” do so soon, an unnamed White House officialtoldthe CNBC financial news network.Trump has drafted a letter dismissing the Fed chair,accordingto the New York Times, which reported that he had shown this to congressional Republicans.At a White House press event, however, Trump poured cold water on speculation that he would try to fire Powell imminently. “We’re not planning on doing it,” he said.The benchmark S&P 500 fell sharply into the red after the initial reports, before recovering after Trump’s comments.Price growthrose in the US last month, as the impact of Trump’s trade policy appeared to boost inflation. The president responded by again calling on the Fed to cut rates, despite policymakers so far holding off primarily due to the threat of a resurgence in inflation.While the president has urged Powell to resign, and attacked him regularly on social media, he does not have the power to fire him over monetary policy. The supreme courtsignaledin May that it viewed the Fed as legally protected.Trump initially nominated Powell to serve as Fed chair during his first term. Joe Biden then tapped him to stay on for another four years, until May 2026. Powell has repeatedly stated that he plans to do so.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveJerome PowellDonald TrumpUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

Both deals are aimed at mitigating supply chain risks after China limited the outgoing supply of rare earths earlier this year in response toDonald Trump’s sweeping tariffs.The deal, announced on Tuesday, guarantees Apple a steady flow of rare earth magnets free fromChina– by far the world’s largest producer. For Apple, the cost to support US magnet production pales in comparison to the long-term risk that it could lose access entirely to the critical components, analysts said.Nvidia becomes first company to reach $4tn in market valueRead more“We’re in an era where executives are willing to pay a significant premium for a reliable supply chain. They don’t want stoppage,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Rare earths are a group of 17 metals used to make magnets that turn power into motion, including the devices that make cellphones vibrate. They are also used in weapons, electric vehicles and many other electronics.China placed export restrictions on rare earths in April in response to Trump’s tariffs. Though the US and China reached a deal in June that has resolved much of the rare earths dispute, broader trade tensions continue to underscore demand for a non-Chinese supply.As part of the agreement,Applewill prepay MP $200m for a supply of magnets slated to begin in 2027. The companies did not disclose the length of the deal nor the volumes of magnets to be provided.The agreement calls for magnets produced from recycled material, in keeping with Apple’s longstanding goal of ending its reliance on the mining industry. They will be produced at MP’s Fort Worth, Texas, facility using magnets recycled at MP’s Mountain Pass, California, mining complex.“Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States,” Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, said in a statement.Las Vegas-based MP Materials’ stock price has nearly doubled since the government deal was announced. It has had remarkable turnaround since last year, when it contemplated merging with an Australian rival as profits plunged in what its CEO, Jim Litinsky, called a “very frustrating” pricing environment for rare earths.Bob O’Donnell, president at market research firm TECHnalysis Research, said Tuesday’s move “makes complete sense” given that Apple requires significant amounts of rare earth magnets for its devices.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But many analysts have said making theiPhonein the US is not possible, given labor costs and the existing smartphone supply chain.Apple did not disclose which devices in which it will use the magnets. MP said the deal will supply magnets for hundreds of millions of devices, which would constitute a significant share of any of Apple’s product lines.MP produces mined and processed rare earths and has said it expects to start commercial magnet production in its Texas facility by the end of this year.Explore more on these topicsAppleMiningiPhoneTrump tariffsTariffsSmartphonesMobile phonesnewsShareReuse this content"

Jeffrey Zients, White House chief of staff under Joe Biden and a Meta director for two years starting in May 2018, is expected to take the stand later on Wednesday in the non-jury trial before Kathaleen McCormick, chief judge of theDelawarechancery court.The case will feature testimony from Zuckerberg and other billionaire defendants including the former chief operating officerSheryl Sandberg, venture capitalist and board member Marc Andreessen, and former board members Peter Thiel, Palantir Technologies co-founder, and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix. A lawyer for the defendants, who have denied the allegations, declined to comment.Zuckerberg says Meta will build data center the size of Manhattan in latest AI pushRead moreMcCormick, the judge whorescinded Elon Musk’s $56bnTesla pay package last year, is expected to rule on liability and damages months after the trial concludes. The case began in 2018, following revelations that data from millions of Facebook users was accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a now defunct political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump’s successful US presidential campaign in 2016.The FTC fined Facebook $5bn in the wake of theCambridge Analyticascandal, saying the company had violated a 2012 agreement to protect user data.Shareholders want the defendants to reimburseMetafor the FTC fine and other legal costs, which the plaintiffs estimate total more than $8bn.In court filings, the defendants described the allegations as “extreme” and said the evidence at trial will show Facebook hired an outside consulting firm to ensure compliance with the FTC agreement and that Facebook was a victim of Cambridge Analytica’s deceit.Meta, which is not a defendant, declined to comment. On its website, the company has said it has invested billions of dollars into protecting user privacy since 2019. The lawsuit is considered the first of its kind to go to trial that alleges that board members consciously failed to oversee their company.Known as a Caremark claim, such lawsuits are often described as the hardest to prove in Delaware corporate law. However, in recent years, Delaware courts have allowed a growing number of these claims to proceed. Boeing’s current and former board members settled a case with similar claims in 2021 for $237.5m, the largest ever in an alleged breach of oversight lawsuit.The Boeing directors did not admit to wrongdoing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bill, which did not address Caremark claims, was drafted after the state’s governor met with representatives of Meta.Most publicly traded companies are incorporated in the state, generating more than a quarter of the state’s budget revenue. Meta, which was reportedly considering leaving Delaware earlier this year, is still incorporated in the state.Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital fund co-founded by Andreessen, said earlier this month that it was reincorporating in Nevada from Delaware and encouraged other companies to do the same. The company cited the uncertainty of the state’s courts and referenced the Musk pay ruling. Andreessen is expected to testify on Thursday.In addition to privacy claims at the heart of the Meta case, plaintiffs allege that Zuckerberg anticipated that the Cambridge Analytica scandal would send the company’s stock lower and sold his Facebook shares as a result, pocketing at least $1bn.Defendants said evidence will show that Zuckerberg did not trade on inside information and that he used a stock-trading plan that removes his control over sales and is designed to guard against insider trading.Explore more on these topicsMetaMark ZuckerbergFacebookCambridge AnalyticaPeter ThielReed HastingsSheryl SandbergnewsShareReuse this content"

He also threatened a 50% tariff on imported copper in an effort to increase US production of the metal.The Trump administrationbegan investigations in Aprilinto imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors into the US under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as part of an attempt to impose tariffs on both sectors on national security grounds.Any levies imposed on pharmaceuticals are expected to hit drugmakers including Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Merck, which haveoverseas production sites, while such a move risks increasing prices for US consumers. Any tariffs on semiconductors are predicted to affect chipmakers and the companies such as Apple and Samsung whose smartphones and computers require chips.Trump’s latest pledge to escalate the global trade war comes as the US’s trading partners are waiting for a temporary pause on the “reciprocal” tariffs announced on 2 April to expire on 1 August, after the deadline was extended from 9 July.It also coincided with the White House launching an investigation into Brazil’s trading practices, which it called unfair. Investigators will look into Brazilian government policies “related to digital trade and electronic payment services; unfair, preferential tariffs; anti-corruption interference; intellectual property protection; ethanol market access; and illegal deforestation”, according to astatement from the trade representative, Jamieson Greer, and whether these restrict US trade.He cited “Brazil’s attacks on American social media companies as well as other unfair trading practices that harm American companies, workers, farmers, and technology innovators”.Trump last week announced 50% tariff on Brazil, despite the fact it has a trade deficit with the US, citing a “witch-hunt” against the country’s former presidentJair Bolsonaro.Trump said on Tuesday he hadstruck a trade pact with Indonesiato reduce the tariff rate levied on the country’s goods, after negotiations.The south-east Asian country made multibillion-dollar commitments to buy US energy, agricultural products and 50 Boeing jets, Trump said in a social media post. As a result, Indonesian goods entering the US would face a 19% tariff, significantly below the 32% level previously threatened.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What are the best ways to get your working life under control? Administrators share their productivity tips and efficiency hacks.Plan your day …“First thing in the morning, I spend half an hour going through emails and making a plan for the day,” says Claudine Hopgood, an administrator for the heads of product planning and network sales at Volkswagen Group UK in Milton Keynes. “You can never schedule 100% of your day; I schedule 80%, and the other 20% is to allow for unforeseen interruptions.”View image in fullscreenStart the day with a plan.Photograph: Posed by model; Maria Korneeva/Getty Images… and your week“Have a good overview of your week,” says Suzanne Ekpenyong, the lead virtual assistant ofan agency of VAsthat she runs from Woodford, east London. “Check your availability and whether it works for you. Do you have enough desk time? Are you travelling too much? Does it work around your personal life? What is your energy going to be like that week? I think everybody should get into the habit of looking at their diary from an energy perspective and seeing if there is enough balance there.”Get the most difficult task out of the way first“I eat the frog first,” says Hopgood, referring to motivational speaker Brian Tracy’s theory that you should start the day with your most tedious task to get it out of the way. “Procrastination is king. If you continually put off the three tasks you have to get done, you know they’re not going to get done. So get them done first and get the dopamine hit afterward.”Maximise your calendar notifications“Make sure you have notifications set up on your diary system,” says Ekpenyong. “Google or Outlook might give a notification 15 minutes before something starts but, when you set up the meeting or appointment, it is useful to put in a notification three days before, two days before, and so on, so that you’re on top of your preparation. This helps you to not stress at the last minute.”Craig Bryson agrees. The executive assistant at a private equity company in Mayfair, who hosts apodcastfor administrators, says: “I use my mobile calendar to remember birthdays and anniversaries – I have 46 cousins, so I need to be on top of that. I always hear the comment, ‘Oh, you’re a man – are you able to multitask?’”Abide by the four Ds“This is great for culling your inbox,” says Ekpenyong. The Ds stand for do, defer, delegate and delete. “Dowhat you need to do in the moment;deferit until later, so it might go on your to-do list at that point;delegateit to someone else – that’s amazing because then they can crack on with it; and the most wonderful thing isdeletingthings that you don’t need, you’ve already done, that are no longer relevant – they can go straight in the bin.”Aspire to inbox zero – but don’t obsess“I’m motivated by the challenge and excitement of thinking, ‘Today’s the day I’ll reach inbox zero’,” says Bryson. “I never do, but I think it’s about the passion of trying.”“Inbox zero is just the best way of working,” says Jess Branch from St Albans, personal assistant to Simon Allford, architect and co-founder of Allford Hall Monaghan Morris. “Especially working with my jobshare, Georgia. We use it as a very clear gauge when we are trying to work out our workload. We categorise all our emails: red is an email that needs to be actioned, green is an email that is waiting on a reply. So it is basically using your inbox as a to-do list and just constantly trying to get it down so you feel ahead of the game.”Have a priority to-do list“I’m a big list-maker,” says Ekpenyong. “I use theAsanaapp, a project- and task-management system. But sometimes it is quicker just to grab a pen and pad and write down your three top priorities because sometimes, when you’re really busy, it’s really easy to think, ‘I can’t cope.’ That is why I swear by a ‘must-do’ list, which is different from my to-do list. These are the things you know are very critical and must absolutely happen that day. Anything else is a bonus.”She also recommends keeping a “ta-da list” of everything you have completed: “It gives you a great sense of achievement, which is often what you need to keep going with the rest of your to-do.”Always make notes“The Notes app on my phone is my saviour,” says Shanice Robertson, a virtual assistant based in Aberdeen. “I’ve tried a few apps but honestly, between my notebook and the Notes app on my phone, I think old-school is the best way.”Hopgood adds: “I have a 3am brain-dump notebook by the bed of just random things.” At work, she has a pen on her lanyard for “when you’re on the fly, you’re going to a meeting and somebody stops you. I’ve always got a small notebook with me that fits in my pocket so I can quickly scribble something down.”“Always write it down,” agrees Bryson. When the executive he works for calls him in, he grabs a pad, “because, by the time you get back to your desk, you’ve probably forgotten exactly what you got asked to do that is important. Your brain is more for ideas and not storage.”Find ways for AI to help you“I use AI to tell me to do stuff,” says Branch. “When I make my packed lunch for the next day, I will say, ‘Alexa, set an alarm for 7.20am for me to take my lunch out of the fridge.’ So while I’m running around, getting my girls out of the house, Alexa will say, ‘Don’t forget to take your lunch.’ Sometimes, I will go to [Microsoft’s AI assistant] Copilot, and say, ‘I need to write an email. It needs to include this, this and this. How should I do it?’ And I’ll just put the facts in, and then it will write an eloquent email that would have taken me 10 minutes.”“If you are feeling overwhelmed,” says Robertson, “you couldput into ChatGPT, ‘Tomorrow, I’ve got to do this; can you work out a plan for me? Break it down into 15-minute goals’, and then you’ll feel better about the next day.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can put a document in and, within seconds, you have a really accurate summary that would have taken you two hours. I joke to my boss, ‘You won’t need me any more.’ But we will still need people. It’s about using AI to your advantage.”Pick up the phone“Sometimes I’d rather stick pins in my eyes than fill out another Doodle poll [to agree a time for a meeting],” says Branch. “If I’m dealing with PAs in other companies, it is much easier to just pick up the phone.”Alternatively, send a voice note, says Robertson: “If I’m in the middle of a task and I remember I need to tell a client something, I’ll just quickly do a voice note – you can work away while it’s recording.”Children limiting own smartphone use to manage mental health, survey findsRead moreGive yourself five seconds to stop procrastinatingRobertson is a fan of the American author Mel Robbins’ five-second rule: “She was lying in bed and she’d seen a rocket on TV the night before, shooting into space, so thought, ‘I’m going to count down 54321 and then launch myself like a rocket.’“If I find I’m scrolling on my phone, or if I’m thinking about doing a task, I say to myself ‘54321’ and I just do it.”View image in fullscreenTry putting your phone away.Photograph: Posed by model; elenaleonova/Getty ImagesIf you need to get something done, hide“I love being distracted,” says Hopgood, “so I do this thing called ‘tactical hiding’ where, if I have something that needs to be done, I will leave my desk. I tell one person where I’m going. I go offline, and I put my phone away. There is a really good app calledForestand, if you have a job, you put in an hour and it grows [virtual] trees. If you pick up your phone and go on to Instagram or something, all your trees die. At the end of the week, you can see how many trees you’ve grown.”Own up to mistakesInevitably, even the most organised people sometimes forget things and the admin assistants all agree you have to have some perspective on this. “If you put the wrong link in an email, is somebody still going to be talking about that five years later? No,” says Branch. “Sometimes things do go wrong, and that’s fine, because I’m not perfect.”“Own up to mistakes,” says Hopgood. “Just put your hands up and say, ‘I messed up. I forgot to do that. This is what I’ve done to put it right.’ But just own your mistake. There’s no point trying to cover it up, because you will always be found out.”“There is no such thing as perfection,” says Bryson. “When we make mistakes, we have to think, ‘I will never do it again, because I remember the feeling from that mistake.’ We learn from them, which is a great thing.”Learn when to switch off“When I go on holiday, I delete Teams from my phone,” says Branch. “There is no reason for me to know anything. I care about my job very passionately, but it isn’t life or death.”During the working day, she says, “make sure you’re standing up and moving around, taking a trip to the photocopier or whatever, and taking breaks. Sometimes, if you have loads and loads to do, it feels like the thing you should do is sit at your desk until it’s done. But you need to have a lunch break, and you’ll be so much more productive when you come back.”“You just have to switch off,” says Bryson. “I’ve heard of people taking a month off work as a result of burnout, because they always reach for their mobile just to see whether there are any messages at 8pm. I have a family and a life I want to be able to focus on. You have to create boundaries to help protect your mental health.”Explore more on these topicsTime managementThe expertsHealth & wellbeingMental healthWork-life balancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The slump also appeared to have surprised Diageo’s management.Diageo had continued to pile supply into Latin America, even as drinkers reined in spending, leaving the region massively overstocked.In the run-up to last Christmas, Diageo appeared to have misjudged its supply chain again, with UK pubscomplaining that their flow of Guinness had been rationedjust as festive demand increased.In February, the group scrapped its longstanding target of shooting for “medium-term” organic sales growth of 5% to 7%, blaming factors including a potential $200m (£149m) impact from Donald Trump’s tariffs. Instead, it opted for less ambitious plans to find $500m of cost savings and achieve $3bn of free cashflow every year from 2026.Mounting pressure on Crew led at one point to fevered speculation that Diageo could try to sell Guinness for £8bn, or off-load its 34% stake in champagne and cognac brand Moët Hennessy, although thecompany denied this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many of Trump’s threats to impose levies in goods imported from other countries have since been delayed or watered down.However, investor sentiment towards Diageo did not improve dramatically. Its share price has fallen to below £20, less than half the £40 in early 2022, disappointing the market, which had anticipated an extended global post-pandemic booze-fuelled rebound.The drinks company’s chair, John Manzoni, said: “On behalf of Diageo and the board, I would like to thank Debra for her contributions to Diageo, including steering the company through the challenging aftermath of the global pandemic and the ensuing geopolitical and macroeconomic volatility.“On behalf of all Diageo colleagues, I wish her every success in the future. The board’s focus is on securing the best candidate to lead Diageo and take the company forward. We strongly believe Diageo is well placed to deliver long-term, sustainable value creation.”Analysts at the investment bank Jefferies said they did not expect Diageo’s next boss to adopt a “kitchen sink” approach by making wholesale strategic changes.However, they said they did “not rule out a stronger mandate for quicker, faster, and deeper change under new management”.Explore more on these topicsDiageoFood & drink industryCorporate governancenewsShareReuse this content"

Many of the arms dealers sold what appeared to be US-produced weapons, some emblazoned with “Property of US Govt”, as well as other western military weapons that were stamped with “Nato”.The report does not specify the arms dealers’ customers but given the high price of the weapons, with some rifles being sold for as much as $10,000 (£7,500), it is likely buyers could be other militants.X andMetaprohibit arms dealing on their platforms. Many of the arms dealers were subscribers to X Premium and users of WhatsApp Business – services that are supposed to be moderated.View image in fullscreenAn arms dealer using a WhatsApp Business account to sell a golden Glock handgun wrapped in a skin showing an American colonial soldier and the words ‘Preserve, Protect, Defend’.Photograph: Tech Transparency ProjectKatie Paul, the director of TTP, said: “X and WhatsApp both have policies against weapons sales but they are allowing arms traders linked to a US-designated terrorist group to traffic weapons on their platforms. In some cases these companies may be profiting off violations of their own policies that create risks for US national security.”More than half of the X accounts listed their location as Sana’a, the Houthi-controlled capital of Yemen, and many regularly shared pro-Houthi content. Others sold weapons in containers marked with the Houthi logo, which states “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse be upon the Jews, victory to Islam”.Several accounts identified by TTP were subscribed to X Premium, which allowed them to post extended videos. One account featured an “unboxing” video of an American M249 SAW, a light machine gun used by the US military. Other accounts used the tip feature, which allows X users to directly send donations to them.X prohibits the use of its platforms by individuals who “promote [terrorist organisations’] illicit activities”, and says it does not allow terrorist groups to use its premium services.View image in fullscreenAn arms dealer on X advertises a weapon in a gun case which bears the logo of the Houthis.Photograph: Tech Transparency ProjectAdverts appeared in the comments of posts selling weapons, suggesting X could be making money off the posts. In one instance, X placed an ad for a company selling Tesla accessories under a post where an arms dealer offered an “all-American” Glock 17 handgun.After Elon Musk bought X in 2022, he laid off about 80% of the company’s trust and safety team, which was dedicated to content moderation. A previous report by TTP found that more than 200 accounts affiliated with terrorist and other sanctioned groups had blue ticks and were subscribed to X Premium.A few of the Houthi-linked arms dealers interacted with Musk himself on X. When Musk posted a video of himself firing a Barret .50-caliber sniper rifle in September 2023, three arms dealers replied to him advertising their own guns, which included two AR-15s.X declined to comment on the findings of TTP’s investigation when approached by the Guardian.Many of the arms dealers also used WhatsApp business accounts with the “catalogue” feature, which allows a slideshow of products to be displayed, to showcase a catalogue of weapons.One such account offered dozens of guns, including a Glock pistol wrapped in a custom skin showing images of the Lincoln Memorial, the White House and an American colonial-era soldier with the words “Preserve, Protect, Defend” written on it.WhatsApp says it reviews business account profiles and checks images before they are added to catalogues. It is unclear why the review process missed the images and accounts, many of which clearly identify themselves as arms dealers and link to Yemeni bricks-and-mortar gun shops in their biographies.A spokesperson for WhatsApp said: “If we identify or are made aware of US-designated terrorist organisations attempting to use our service, we will take appropriate action – including banning accounts – to comply with our legal obligations.”WhatsApp then banned two accounts sent by the Guardian. It clarified that it did not make profit from the type of accounts in question, but it did not otherwise reply to questions as to how the company’s review processes initially missed the arms dealers’ accounts.Meta has laid off thousands of employees in the last two years, many dedicated to safety. In January, Metavowedto roll back content moderation, in what seemed to be an acknowledgment of Donald Trump’s complaints of censorship on social media platforms.TTP found that the vast majority of the Houthi-affiliated arms dealers’ accounts on X and WhatsApp were created after the layoffs at both companies.Paul said: “Both Meta and X have the capital, the tools and the human resources to address this problem, but they’re not doing so.”Besides content moderation issues, TTP’s findings also raised questions about global arms smuggling.Taimur Khan, the head of Gulf regional operations at Conflict Armament Research, said tracing exactly how US-made weapons got to Houthi-held territory was difficult and there were several possible explanations.Some of the weapons, particularly the American M4 rifles, were possibly from stocks supplied to Yemeni government forces before 2014 that were seized by the Houthis when they launched their insurgency.Khan said other US weapons being sold by the accounts appeared “to have been diverted more recently” and were made for civilian customers rather than soldiers. Those weapons could have been trafficked from the US to Yemen through the Gulf and elsewhere in the regionor by other means, he added.Non-American weapons are also smuggled into Yemen along other regional trafficking routes. They are also supplied directly to the Houthis via their allies, such as Iran.Earlier this year, the US imposedsanctionson a Houthi arms smuggling network that was accused of procuring “tens of millions of dollars’” worth of Russian weapons with the assistance of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.“The arms that are being advertised in Houthi-controlled areas by weapon dealers, who are at some level linked to the Houthis, reflect all the different vectors of supply in Yemen,” Khan said.Explore more on these topicsHouthisYemenWhatsAppMetaXMiddle East and north AfricaInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the team absolutely condemns any protests or actions of individuals that interfere with racing at the Tour de France or threaten the safety of the entire peloton.”The team have been surrounded by a significant armed police presence since the race started in Lille on 5 July. “The security measures afforded to the team during the Tour de France are the directive of [the race organiser] ASO and relevant French police departments,” the statement read. “The team cooperates fully with the security protocols outlined by the race and appreciates the significant efforts made by all parties to ensure team members’ safety at the race.”Pogacar’s crash came with 6km to race after he touched the rear wheel of Abrahamsen’s teammate Tobias Johannessen and crashed on his left side, before sliding into the kerb. “I’m a bit beaten up, but we’ve been through worse days,” Pogacar said after the finish.Of the circumstances surrounding his fall, he said: “I think everybody was a bità bloc. There were attacks from Matteo [Jorgenson] and Jonas Vingegaard, they really put everybody on the limit. Unfortunately one rider decided to follow from left to right side of the road. He didn’t see me and he just completely cut me off, my front wheel.View image in fullscreenTadej Pogacar (centre) competes on stage 11 of the Tour de France.Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty Images“Luckily, I just have a little bit of skin off. I was scared when I saw the sidewalk that I was going [to hit] my head directly to the sidewalk, but luckily my skin is tough and stopped me before the sidewalk.”The defending champion was quickly back on his feet but, after struggling to rethread his dropped chain, was in danger of losing time in the overall standings.However, the group of main favourites he had been riding with, including the race leader, Ben Healy, and key rivals Remco Evenepoel and Vingegaard, slowed their pace in the closing kilometres and waited for the Slovenian to rejoin.“Thanks to the peloton in front,” Pogacar said. “They actually waited. Obviously the race was more or less over back there, but still, they could take time – maybe not take too much time – but I would need to go really deep to come back like this. Really big respect to everybody in front.”Pogacar finished the stage with blood on his left arm, and scuffing on his hip and shoulder. He has already lost a key teammate, João Almeida, who was forced to abandon the Tour after crashing on the stage to Mûr-de-Bretagne.“Tomorrow is a big day,” the defending champion said of the first high-altitude finish at Hautacam in the Hautes-Pyrénées on Thursday. “We’ll see how I recover. Normally the day after a crash you’re never at the best, but I will give my best and we’ll see. I think we’re ready as a team for Hautacam.”Pogacar’s Emirates XRG team manager, Mauro Gianetti, who also described his rider as “angry”, said: “A crash makes you worry because you never know. It could be an easy crash, or a big crash. Fortunately that one, even though it was quite high speed, was not that damaging for Tadej himself.”There is little doubt, however, that Vingegaard’s Visma-Lease a bike team will be buoyed by the troubles befalling the champion. In the aftermath of the loss of Almeida, the last thing Pogacar needs is to be handicapped on a daunting climb on which his Danish rival sealed Tour victory over him in 2022.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarTour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

He was 49.Grønvold won bronze at the 2010 Vancouver Games.“It is with great sadness that we have received the news of Audun Grønvold’s untimely passing,” the federation said. “The former national alpine skier and ski cross athlete was recently struck by lightning during a cabin trip.”The federation said Grønvold was “quickly taken to hospital and received treatment for the injuries he sustained in the lightning strike” but died on Tuesday night.Grønvold was a member of Norway’s alpine skiing team before he moved into freestyle and ski cross. He had one podium finish as a World Cup alpine skier, finishing third in a downhill in Sierra Nevada, Spain, in 1999.He also won a bronze medal in ski cross at the 2005 world championships, and the overall ski cross cup in 2007. After his career ended, he became a national-team coach and a TV commentator.“Norwegian skiing has lost a prominent figure, who has meant so much to both the Alpine and freestyle communities,” the federation president, Tove Moe Dyrhaug, said, adding that his death created “a huge void”.Grønvold his survived by his wife and three children. His wife, Kristin Tandberg Haugsjå, said in a Facebook post that her husband was “my great love and my best friend for 20 years”.

So, how did it go? Here’s a handful of storylines to chew on as we prepare for the second-half stretch run.What hasn’t happenedRemember the torpedo bats that were a destroyer of worlds in the season’s opening days? Some geniuses even said they were the latest example of how “over-innovation can ruin baseball”(no idea who wrote that zinger). Well, so far that’s looking likethekneejerk reaction of the season, or maybe several seasons. The Yankees, who are the chief adapters of the redesigned bats that boast customized sweet spots, hit 15 home runs in three games against Milwaukee at the start of the season. Then they calmed down and struck 1.46 home runs per game from then on. Yes, they still lead the league in homers, and yes, they’re averaging more dingers per game than they did last year when Juan Soto was in their lineup. But the tech hasnotin fact made a complete farce of the game. Has Cal Raleigh,the Mariners’ torpedo bat swinging MVP candidate, been aided by the innovation? Well, he has 38 homers this season, four more than his career-high already, while Triple Crown candidate Aaron Judge, who doesn’t use a torpedo bat, has 35. This time, let’s go with a more conservative take on the bats: the jury’s still out.View image in fullscreenCal Raleigh’s wild, breakout season continued with a win at the Home Run Derby in Atlanta on Monday.Photograph: Mike Stewart/APOh, the bullpens …What drives fans the most crazy? The way their manager handles his bullpen. Don’t believe me? Try searching “bullpen management” on X and see what comes up; it’s not pretty. But here’s the thing: when your starting pitchers average well under six innings a game, and you have to figure out how to get an additional nine, 12, 15 outs or more, where’s the roadmap for that? There isn’t one – managers make it up on the fly most nights. With a bevy of starters recovering from elbow injuries, while upper management continues to nurse the long men, desperate brass are forced to shuttle relievers between the minors and the majors looking for fresh arms. It’s pretty ugly. Is anyone getting it “right?” Well, few outside LA are going to sympathize with the super-rich Dodgers, but their skipper Dave Roberts is getting just4.5 innings a gamefrom his beleaguered, injury riddled starters, the worst number in all of baseball (the MLB average is 5.2). Apparently there’s more than a few teams that’ll be looking for bullpen help at the 31 July trade deadline. Yeah, you think?Stand up for DetroitRemember last July when the Tigers were dealing away players, and then somehow made the playoffs and came within a single victory of the American League Championship Series? Well, as it turns out, that run was no fluke. The Tigers have an 11.5 game lead in the AL Central at the break, the largest such lead they’ve had since the All-Star Game began in 1933. For context, the historic 1984 Tigers that began 35-5 had an eight-game lead at the break. Detroit own the best record in all of baseball, even after losing their last four games.View image in fullscreenWhen it comes to time for Tarik Skubal to pitch, just wind him up and let him go.Photograph: Jose Juarez/APSo what’s gone right? Tarik Skubal has stiff competition from Boston’s Garrett Crochet in his bid to win a second successive Cy Young, but the Tigers hurler has walked just 16 batters in 121 innings – an astonishingly low number. Meanwhile, Detroit’s lineup is full of redemption songs, with three players in the top five favored for the AL Comeback Player of the Year award (Rangers ace Jacob deGrom leads that group). Former No 1 overall pick Spencer Torkelson has recovered from an abysmal 2024 to power up a Tigers offense driven by Gleyber Torres, Riley Greene and Zach McKinstry, allowing the bats to overshadow a middle-of-the road pitching staff, Skubal aside. But perhaps the story of the season is Javier Baez. The once big-dollar-bust is an All-Star this season, and has upped his OPS by more than 230 points from last season and is Detroit’s face of mojo as they head to the second half of the season.The Lost BoysThe Colorado Rockies weren’t daunted by the 2024 White Sox’modern MLB recordfor losses in a season. With a team of misfits, horrific ownership and tough NL West neighbors, the Rockies went to work on besting (or worsting) the ChiSox right out of the gate. And away they went, losing 36 of 46 games at Coors Field, a modern home record.View image in fullscreenOops!Photograph: Jay LaPrete/APElsewhere, pitching phenom Paul Skenes is one of the only bright lights at the Pirates, who continue to sag, having failed to finish higher than fourth in the NL Central since 2017. Their lack of competitive play is even enough to get Commissioner Rob Manfredsomewhat “concerned” about the Buccos, not to mention teams such as the Marlins, who lead a system of meandering franchises whose ownership appear uninterested in winning. Clearly a salary cap, which every other major North American sports league has in some form or other, could help with such imbalance. But with a divide between rich and richer owners and a players’ union that’s fought against a cap for its entire existence, that will always be a tough sell, and so the issue will be a source of labor strife after the 2026 season.And speaking of a tough sell,MLBhas been trying to unload a short-term package of games since ESPN opted out of the final three years of their rights deal worth roughly $1.5bn. Manfred, who admitted that having to find another suitor to replace those lost dollars is not all that fun, says there’s been “progress” in that search and says he should have some news in the coming weeks.Odds and endsThanks to breakout star Pete-Crowe Armstrong, Kyle Tucker, Nico Hoerner and virtually everyone else in the Cubbies lineup, Chicago are having their biggestOPS+year since, well, 1884. They lead the Brewers in the NL Central by a single game. In the NL East, the Phillies have power issues, but it’s Zach Wheeler and their starting pitching that’s given them a short lead over the Mets, who started fast and fell faster, losing 17 of 27 games heading into the break. In the AL East, the Yankees slumped themselves out of first place, while the surprising Blue Jays overtook the Bombers despite an inferior run difference. The once hotter than hot Rays traded places with the Red Sox who rode a 10-game winning streak into third place at the break, all after controversially trading away Rafael Devers and losing Alex Bregman to injury. The Houston Astros of the AL West dealt away their best player, Tucker, in the offseason, but look better without him: hurlers Framber Valdez, Hunter Brown and a white hot pen have the ‘Stros in a commanding first place position after an un-Astro-like 2024. In the NL West, the “Best Team Ever” are yet to play like it, but then again, LA have been missing most of their rotation for most of the season.View image in fullscreenWhat doesn’t Shohei Ohtani do?Photograph: Godofredo A Vásquez/APThe Dodgers are likely to get stronger when it matters though.Shohei Ohtaniis pitching again and has an ERA just over one as he stretches out for the postseason, Tyler Glasnow just returned, with Blake Snell and Roki Sasaki to follow.

But he had never walked up to the plate in an All-Star Game swing-off. No one had.“That’s kind of like the baseball version of a shootout,” he said after homering on all three of his swings, going down to his left knee on the final one, to overcome a two-homer deficit. That held up when Jonathan Aranda fell short on the American League’s final three swings, giving the National League a 4-3 swing-off win after a 6-6 tie on Tuesday night in which the team had wasted a six-run, seventh-inning lead.Concerned about running out of pitchers in an era where no All-Star throws more than one inning, Major League Baseball and the players’ association made the change in 2022. In baseball’s equivalent of soccer’s penalty-shootout, the game was decided by having three batters from each league take three swings each off coaches.“It will be interesting to see where [the swing-off rule] goes,” said AL manager Aaron Boone of the New York Yankees. “There’s probably a world where you could see that in the future, where maybe it’s in some regular season mix. I wouldn’t be surprised if people start talking about it like that.”Boone picked Brent Rooker, Randy Arozarena and Aranda on Monday, and Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts picked Eugenio Suárez, Schwarber and Pete Alonso for the NL. Because Suárez was hit on the left hand by a fastball in the eighth inning, the NL turned to the team’s alternate, Kyle Stowers.MLB storylines at the All-Star break: bullpen woes, dazzling Detroit and torpedo bats reconsideredRead morePlayers from both teams stood outside their dugouts, some already in street clothes, jumping and shouting after each long ball from their side. Yankees coach Travis Chapman threw to the AL batters and Dodgers coach Dino Ebel to the NL hitters.Rooker put the AL ahead by homering on his last two swings, and Stowers hit one. Randy Arozarena boosted the AL lead to 3-1. Ebel had thrown BP to Schwarber two years ago at the WBC.“He asked me right before, he was like, where do you want it?” Schwarber recalled “I’m like, just middle. And he’s like, ‘I gotcha.’”He took two pitches and deposited the third just over the center-field fence. Schwarber took another, then hit a 461ft drive over the right-center bullpen. After letting two more go by, he dropped to a knee while pulling the third, craned his neck and held his bat it the air as the ball landed in the fourth row of the Chop House seats.“I didn’t hit it, obviously, my best, but I was thinking I got enough of it,” Schwarber said. “And I was just kind of down there, hoping, saying: go, go, go. And it went. And it was awesome.”Aranda followed with a fly well short of the center-field warning track, drove a pitch about a foot shy of the top of the right-field wall and hit an opposite-field pop that dropped in medium left.Alonso, a two-time Home Run Derby champion, didn’t have to bat and patted Schwarber on the head as fireworks went off at Truist Field.“I felt like a closer like a closer going into a game,” Alonso said, “and then it’s like, wait, the guy in the field got a double play to end the inning. You’re not going in.”MLB, after consulting with the Elias Sports Bureau, said in 2022 that All-Star Games ending in a swing-off would be listed as tied, with a notation of the game being decided in a swing-off. MLB’s official postgame notes listed Tuesday’s outcome as a 7-6 NL victory.Earlier in the game, Ketel Marte’s two-run double in the first had put the NL ahead, and Alonso’s three-run homer off Kris Bubic and Corbin Carroll’s solo shot against Casey Mize opened a 6-0 lead in the sixth.The AL comeback began when Rooker hit a three-run pinch homer against Randy Rodríguez in a four-run seventh that included Bobby Witt Jr’s RBI groundout. Robert Suarez allowed consecutive doubles to Byron Buxton and Witt with one out in ninth, and Steven Kwan’s infield hit on a three-hopper to third off Edwin Díaz drove in the tying run.Schwarber earned the MVP award, going 0 for 2 with a walk as the NL won for the second time in their last 12 tries. He became the first non-pitcher MVP without a hit.Explore more on these topicsMLBPhiladelphia PhilliesBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

I saw in the eyes of my teammates something I can’t explain in words. We knew it was difficult to reach the semi-final but we all knew we could do it.“It’s something magical. Tonight being among the four best teams is a great satisfaction. We are doing this for our glory but the meaning is much deeper and we want to bring this meaning to Italy. In Italy we can play football and also women and girls can play football.”For both teams this tie represented a priceless opportunity to reach a semi-final, after a relatively kind draw. They had both been eliminated at the group stage of the European Championship in 2017 and 2022. They had both given their supporters cause for optimism during their group matches and knew the heavyweight contenders were all in action later this week in the other last-eight fixtures. Perhaps, with that, came a few nerves.View image in fullscreenAda Hegerberg stares at the floor at full time after Norway’s defeat.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersNorway supporters were certainly in the minority as Italy fans flocked to Geneva and Norway also created the minority of the first-half chances, as the Italians showed the greater attacking endeavour in a cautious first 45 minutes. A tournament-record average of 3.7 goals per game had been scored in the group stages, as attacking football became the norm. But perhaps it was to be expected that the start of the knockout rounds would deliver a goalless first 45 minutes, an element of caginess creeping into both sides.Despite the slow tempo, Italy played some neat football, going close through Manuela Giugliano, Girelli’s attempted header and Lucia Di Guglielmo, while their energetic midfielder Emma Severini burst into the penalty area but saw her shot well saved by the Norway goalkeeper Cecilie Fiskerstrand.The Italians broke the deadlock when Sofia Cantore’s goalbound shot from the right side of the box was angled into the net with the gentlest of touches from Girelli. Italy had the momentum suddenly and Cantore thought she had doubled the lead moments later but her scrambled effort was disallowed for offside. Soon the game was seesawing as Norway were awarded a penalty when Hegerberg was bundled down by Elena Linari.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hegerberg redeemed herself by running on to Maren Mjelde’s long ball and tucking past Laura Giuliani, who had been too hesitant to come off her line.

And England must not underestimate that feeling for the Swedes.It was a humiliating defeat for Peter Gerhardsson’s team but they are in a much better place now than three years ago. They have really impressed in this competition so far and they are on a 15-game unbeaten run that has lasted just over a year.Kelly backs England’s ‘positive clique’ of finishers to deliver against SwedenRead moreThere is a danger of England thinking: “Oh, we’ve beaten this lot in the last Euros.” As a coach I always worry about a wounded team and I think Sweden are that, and I can say this categorically: Swedish players are the most tactical players I’ve coached, the most studious players, the most team‑oriented players, and they leave their ego at the door. For those reasons, they’re a threat to every team, and they’re a big threat to England in this fantastic quarter-final in Zurich.When I look at my own analysis, and I look at individuals, if you take the top 150 players in the world, of the teams in this tournament, Sweden would rank as the seventh best, but they are much stronger as a sum of their parts, as a team. Before their last gameagainst Germany, they were ranked as fourth favourites to win the title, so this is a group that have “team” at the centre of everything they do. They’ll be highly tactical and organised out of possession.Their midfielder Kosovare Asllani has been exceptional and so has Filippa Angeldal. In Nathalie Björn they have a leader at the back who is competent in possession but also really good at running a defensive line. The midfielder Johanna Rytting Kaneryd has been playing well and was particularly impressive against Poland. So I think this is a tougher test for England than it would have been against Germany – not because I don’t rate Germany – I think they are wonderful going forward – but I think they’re so vulnerable defensively, whereas Sweden are stingy as hell in defence. Don’t think: “Oh, good, we’ve avoided Germany.” No, this is a game nobody would take lightly.View image in fullscreenHead coach Peter Gerhardsson (centre) will step down after this tournament but has Sweden well organised after eight years in charge.Photograph: Ludvig Thunman/Bildbryån/ShutterstockAs a coach, England are the better team and they are the favourites but they’re playing against a Sweden team with far greater organisation than England faced against Walesor the Netherlands, and the things that have hurt the holders, the physical pace and power of France, are threats that Sweden pose too in transitional moments.Since the last European Championship, Sweden have also brought through the right players and they’ve found another real player in Smilla Holmberg, the right-back. I think she’s got everything to go the whole way. It is Gerhardsson’s final tournament with the team but there’s a consistency in his setup. He’s worked with his strongest eight or nine players for a period of time so there’s a real understanding between them, he’s calm and consistent in his approach, and I think he will have learned a lot from those failures in 2022.Quick GuideEngland v Sweden: past three meetingsShowEngland 4-0 Sweden, 26 July 2022, Sheffield\"One of the best goals you will ever see,\" the former England defender Stephen Warnock said – and few disagreed. Alessia Russo’s audacious backheel nutmeg sealed England’s third in style, a goal of the tournament winner from the bench. The Euro 2022 semi-final against Sweden played out like a dream: Beth Mead opened the scoring, Lucy Bronze powered in a header, and Fran Kirby’s clever lob capped it off. Four goals, four statements. The Lionesses were ruthless. Sweden simply had no reply.England 1-1 Sweden, 5 April 2024, LondonSweden looked nothing like the side torn apart at Euro 2022. In a closely contested qualifier, they held firm against an England team dominant in possession but short on chances. Alessia Russo, once again in imperious form, broke through with a striker’s dream – a one-on-one calmly slotted home. Both sides grew bolder as the game wore on. A moment’s lapse from the Lionesses and Sweden’s rising star Rosa Kafaji Roflo punished them with an electric equaliser – well-earned.Sweden 0-0 England, 16 July 2024, GothenburgIt may have ended goalless but England got what they came for. A draw in Gothenburg sealed their place at Euro 2025. \"Keeping it to 0-0, qualifying from a very hard group – I'm very relieved,\" the head coach, Sarina Wiegman, said. The Lionesses impressed early but faded, relying on the goalkeeper Hannah Hampton to keep their clean sheet. Georgia Stanway came closest to scoring with a strike from distance. Sweden, backed by a lively home crowd, failed to capitalise on the buzz.Nasra AbdiWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.He’s not a big risk-taker. I could very much see Sweden set up in an organised block but it’ll be interesting to see how low they sit. Will they really just absorb pressure and allow England to have the ball? On Saturday, Sweden beat the Germany press and got up against a backline which wasn’t the quickest. It is similar with England. Sarina Wiegman’s side will be very aggressive with lots of players up high, very aggressive in the counterpress, and if Sweden solve this situation like France did, then I think you’re going to see similarly tough moments for England to defend.But it will be interesting to see what Sweden have learned because they play in a really compact 4-4-2 and if you don’t get those distances right England will pick you off in the pockets. Especially Lauren James. When she is in the mood she was inagainst Wales, and she’s in “that place”, she’s enjoying her football, we all know she’s one of the best players in the world. She’s been brilliant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAlso, this is the best place I’ve ever seen Ella Toone in, for England. She’s beenhugely impactful for the team. She is exploiting the spaces between the full-backs and the centre-backs, and those runs from deep are really helping England. I think she’s playing with the bit between her teeth. She’s got a bit of a chip in her performance, and I like that side of Ella Toone. She seems more mature, focused and like someone who obviously has a natural telepathy with Alessia Russo. You can see how much they care for each other as friends, but also how they know each other’s game inside out. That’s really helpful because maybe Russo is taking up so much attention from defenders and giving a bit more space for Ella.At the opposite end of the pitch, England have to be wary of Stina Blackstenius. She was a nightmare to play against. In fact, when I was the Chelsea manager, we were always grateful when she wasn’t in the starting lineup for Arsenal. She makes it that much harder for you as a team to be so high up the pitch, because of her channel runs. She’s also improved in the little movements, to stay onside.I always thought she was a player that drifted offside a lot but I think she’s brought a lot of what we call double movements into her game – ie, lots of running across a line onside – and she’s got better at holding those runs to stay onside. And she’s been clinical. I think she’s at her best level yet. I always rated her decisiveness and being clinical – she’s got everything in her locker. She’s good if you’ve got balls coming into the box, she’s good at running in behind and she now looks a more complete player.Whoever wins this quarter-final will be the favourites for their semi‑final and should be expected to make the final, but football isn’t that straightforward. What is important to say is that the quality of the quarter-finalists compared with Euro 2022 is so much higher. Italy’s performance against Spain in the group stage showed that finally years of work on their domestic league is bearing fruit. And France, phwoar, it’ll take a lot to beat France. I can’t wait to watch them against Germany and the other match-ups.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamSweden women's football teamWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

From the higher floors of the 385-metre PIF Tower, employees can plot their next deal while gazing down on a glass-curtained canopy of concrete, steel and polished marble.For Yasir al-Rumayyan, the governor of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) and the chair ofNewcastle United, the top of this striking, 80-storey crystalline structure is a place where metaphorical blue-sky thinking meets reality.Liverpool make approach to sign Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo EkitikeRead moreThe bad news for Eddie Howe is that the business case for selling Alexander Isak toLiverpoolthis summer is surely far too persuasive for Rumayyan and his colleagues to ignore.In an ideal world Newcastle’s manager would keep the Sweden centre-forward while acquiring the France Under-21 striker Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt before a Champions League campaign. Given that Liverpool, like Newcastle, have madecontact with Eintracht over Ekitikeand seem determined to acquire the Frenchman or Isak that scenario seems unlikely.The message from Newcastle – and it is said to originate “right from the very top” in Riyadh – has consistently been that Isak will not be sold this year. Indeed, the word is that Howe wants to deviate from his preferred, winger-heavy 4-3-3 and play Isak and Ekitike in attacking tandem.But, even before contemplating the reality that insisting something or someone is not for sale at any price is frequently a precursor to driving a hard bargain, that supposed stance begs quite a few questions.View image in fullscreenHugo Ekitike, who scored 22 goals last season for Eintracht Frankfurt, has already been a target twice for Eddie Howe at Newcastle.Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA-EFEFirst and foremost why, shortly after Howe and club officials met Isak’s agent, did Newcastle suddenly turn their attention from potential £30m replacements for Isak’s former understudy Callum Wilson to more expensive targets and end up offeringEintracht Frankfurtapproaching £70m for Ekitike? Was it really pure coincidence?And why has there not been any announcement of Isak entering long-mooted summer negotiations to extend a contract that runs until 2028? Even if a player who scored 23 goals in 34 Premier League appearances last season declined to sign, a deal could surely be discussed.Although Isak is extremely well paid at about £150,000 a week, talks regarding a planned pay increase last summer were postponed as Newcastle struggled to stay on the right side of Premier League spending rules. Much improved terms seem his for the taking now but maybe that moment has passed and Isak would rather move to pastures new.Newcastle have long suspected that he would decline an extension this summer, and their original plan was to keep him for one more season and sell high in 12 months. But Ekitike’s wages would almost certainly be slightly cheaper and, having just turned 23, he is almost three years younger than Isak. Throw in some stylistic similarities in the pair’s games – for a start both like to drift to the left and suit counterattacking tactics – and the fact that Ekitike is less injury prone and the case for doing a deal with Liverpool becomes ever more persuasive.Then there’s Howe’s relationship with Richard Hughes. Newcastle’s manager and Liverpool’s sporting director are good friends, stemming from their days together at Bournemouth. Although Liverpool deny making a formal approach for Isak, the fact that intermediaries have subtly made clear that Arne Slot’s board would be prepared to pay about £120m for Howe’s prize possession suggests they have received encouragement, however tacit, from someone, somewhere.View image in fullscreenEddie Howe (left) welcomes new signing Anthony Elanga to Newcastle, but how many other players will the club manage to sign this summer?Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty ImagesWithPaul Mitchell having stepped down as Newcastle’s sporting directorthis summer and Darren Eales, the chief executive, due to depart on health grounds, Andy Howe, the manager’s nephew, has a key role in recruitment.

Considering Howe needs a right-sided central defender and a goalkeeper – negotiations with Burnley are inching towards a £30m-plus deal for James Trafford – in addition to replacing the Leeds-bound Sean Longstaff in midfield, something is going to have to give.Accordingly if Newcastle can sell Isak for almost double the near-£65m they paid Real Sociedad for him it would reflect extremely well on their PSR balance sheet. The attendant financial wriggle room would help fund the purchase of a central striker as cover for Ekitike or whoever joins as the first choice, and maybe even a move for Coventry’s Jack Rudoni, an attacking midfielder much coveted by Howe.It all leaves the ball firmly in Eintracht’s court. The German club are noted as tough negotiators and hope for more than Ekitike’s £87m release clause. Bundesliga strikers have not always fared overly well in the Premier League but the Frenchman scored 22 goals last season, including 15 in the league to help Eintracht qualify for the Champions League. In 2022 he was Newcastle’s top attacking target, ahead of even Isak. Howe has twice tried, and failed, to buy him.Liverpool possess the pulling power and financial clout to tempt Ekitike to play for Slot rather than Howe but is Isak the striker Slot really wants?One thing is clear. If Newcastle cannot sign Ekitike the stack of cards collapses and it becomes impossible to imagine anyone in PIF Tower approving Isak’s sale.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedLiverpoolEintracht FrankfurtTransfer windowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Brentford also privately indicated a medical was expected imminently.Ethan Nwaneri poised to sign new Arsenal deal amid Chelsea and Bundesliga interestRead moreThe change of stance has been met with resistance by Ratcliffe and Wilcox, who do not wish to be held to ransom and are determined to be patient. Brentford view their position as firm because although Mbeumo’s contract expires next summer the club hold a one-year option.If Ratcliffe, who oversees football operations at United, and Wilcox decide to raise their offer they may first want money from the sale or loan of one of Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.

A series of late approaches from Brentford are understood to have been firmed up with an offer shortly before the deadline, but that failed to meet the requirements.The bid was spread in instalments, with Ipswich instead requiring cash up front. The expiry of the clause gives Ipswich greater control of the 21-year-old’s destiny but their resolve could still be tested if Brentford return with a more palatable payment structure.Brentford are undergoing a summer revamp under Keith Andrews and are keen on signing Hutchinson, who shone for England in theirvictorious Uefa Under-21 Championship campaign.Elsewhere, Bournemouth have completed the £25m signing of the goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic from Chelsea on a five-year deal.

It was revealed last month thatForest had written to Uefa to raise concernsthat Palace could be in breach of regulations that bar clubs with the same owner from competing in the same competition if an individual or ownership group is considered to have a decisive influence over more than one of those teams.‘It’s not fair’: Crystal Palace fans march in protest at demotion from Europa LeagueRead moreUefa deemed that a move by Palace’s biggest shareholder, John Textor, whose company Eagle Football Holdings also owns Lyon – who have also qualified for the Europa League – tosell his stake to the New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson, had come too late despite completion of the deal now being imminent. The Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, who also owns the Greek champions Olympiakos, placed his shares into a blind trust to comply with the rules in the event that Forest qualified for the Champions League. Uefa rejected Textor’s attempts to do the same after he missed the 1 March deadline.Parish, asked by Gary Lineker on The Rest is Football podcast whether Forest had played a part in Palace being demoted, said: “Yes. We were told that and I think it’s been made public. These things seem to be played out in public. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of confidentiality that comes out of certain organisations. But we’re led to believe that that’s the issue – if there wasn’t somebody that wanted to get in as a consequence, then there wouldn’t be a problem.“People have got to look at themselves. Some people will say it’s fine, some people will say it’s not. I don’t really have control of that. I only have control of the arguments that we put forward toUefa.”Forest declined to comment. Parish said he was “very hopeful” of winning the appeal at Cas, which he expects to take place before the end of the month.View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace earned a place in next season’s Europa League by winning the FA Cup for the first time last season.Photograph: Nick Potts/PA“We get the written ruling from last week’s decision with all the details from Uefa and then, apparently, the appeal is 10 days,” he said.“I think [the Uefa president] Mr Ceferin could resolve this situation, and it would be a very good look if he did, because I think most people think it is right that we are in the competition. The draw for the Conference League is 4 August, so this needs to be wrapped up by the end of July.”Meanwhile, a group of Liberal Democrat MPs from south London has written to the culture secretary urging her to intervene over Palace’s demotion, as the club’s most influential supporters’ group plans to take its protest to Uefa’s headquarters in Switzerland. Hundreds of supportersmarched to Selhurst Parkon Tuesday night to voice anger at Uefa’s decision.A letter was sent to Lisa Nandy on Wednesday by seven Lib Dem MPs including Bobby Dean, whose Carshalton and Wallington constituency contains many Palace supporters, and the leader, Sir Ed Davey, expressing deep concern over Palace’s “disgraceful treatment”. It requested that the secretary of state for culture, media and sport ensure “the decision-making process is reviewed for transparency and fairness” and “the club is given a fair opportunity to appeal or respond to any allegations”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many believe that this process has been opaque and disproportionately punitive. We hope you will take this matter seriously and act to uphold the principles of fairness, accountability, and integrity in sport.”Dean told the Guardian: “This is heartbreaking for fans. In what should be an unblemished year of celebration for the club, officials totally disconnected from the side’s success on the pitch have issued a highly unusual and severe punishment that raises serious questions about fairness in the governance of English football.

It is understood candidates were asked before their test to download software, which was then checked by an online invigilator. But issues with the software meant they were often left with insufficient time to answer the questions or found some answers had not been recorded.“I attempted several times to fix the issue by disconnecting and reconnecting, but it took over 25 minutes before the connection was restored,” wrote one candidate from Niger in a letter to Fifa seen by the Guardian. “Once I was allowed to resume, there were only about 10 minutes remaining on the exam. On July 3, 2025, I received my results and was surprised to see that I had failed with a score of 11 out of 20. However, among the nine questions marked as incorrect, seven were shown as blank, even though I clearly remember answering them before submission, one displayed a choice that I am certain I never selected, and it does not match the answer I intended to choose.”Another candidate from the UK said he had been told by his invigilator that “the issue was not related to my device or internet connection, but rather to the platform itself. After several unsuccessful attempts, the invigilator advised me to disconnect and assured me that she would submit a detailed report to Fifa, explicitly stating that I had been unable to participate due to aforce majeuresituation, as defined in article 12 of the Fifa football agent exam rules (March 2025 edition).

The arrival of Andrew Cavenagh and the San Francisco 49ers asRangers’ new ownershas the potential to shake up a Scottish top division that has been won by Rangers’ fierce rivals, Celtic, in 13 of the last 14 seasons.It’s not just at the top, however, where American money is reshaping Scottish soccer. Six of the Scottish Premiership’s 12 clubs are now American-owned. The 49ers’ purchase of Rangers wasn’t even the only US takeover of a Scottish club this summer: Calvin Ford, the great-great-grandson of Henry Ford, completed a deal to buy Livingston. Scotland’s top division is now just one club away from having a majority of American owners.The trend started in 2013 when Tim Keyes and John Nelms turned up at Dundee. Five years later, Mark Ogren bought Dundee United. More recently, Bournemouth owner Bill Foley invested in Hibernian, who have been owned by the Gordon family since 2019, while St Johnstone were bought by Adam Webb. All Americans and all bullish on the untapped potential of Scottish soccer.‘It’s not fair’: Crystal Palace fans march in protest at demotion from Europa LeagueRead moreOf course, American investment in soccer is not unique to Scotland. Half of the Premier League’s 20 clubs now under US ownership following Dan Friedkin’s takeover of Everton in September, adding the film producer’s name to a list that includes Foley, Fenway Sports Group, the Glazers, Stan Kroenke, Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, Wes Edens, John Textor and Shahid Khan. Nine EFL clubs, including Birmingham City and Wrexham, are also American-owned, offering a lower on-ramp for those without the funds to go toe-to-toe with a sovereign wealth fund.The on-ramp to get into Scottish soccer is even lower, partially explaining why so many American millionaires have looked north of the England/Scotland border to invest. While the 49ers were able to snag a majority ownership stake inRangersfor £150m ($200m), New York Jets owner Woody Johnson has agreed to pay more than that (£190m/$254m) for a smaller share (44.9%) in Crystal Palace, a club that finished 12th in the Premier League last season. Friedkin had to pay over £400m ($535m) for Everton who have spent the last few seasons flirting with relegation.Rangers can only look enviously over Hadrian’s Wall at the self-proclaimed Best League In The World and its associated riches, but they do have access to European soccer. Indeed, the Govan club made a run to the Europa League final three seasons ago and played in the Champions League two seasons ago, earning tens of millions in the process.Today there are more Scottish teams in Europe than ever before, largely due to the creation of the Conference League. The likes of Aberdeen, Dundee United, Hearts, Hibernian, Kilmarnock, Motherwell and St Mirren were previously locked out of continental competition on account ofCelticand Rangers’ strength, all have qualified for the Conference League in recent seasons, giving them a path to continental football and associated financial rewards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hibernian are part of Foley’s Black Knight network that includes Bournemouth, Auckland FC and FC Lorient. Brighton owner Tony Bloom recently acquired a stake in Hearts that puts the Edinburgh club under the same umbrella as the Premier League club and Belgian champions Union Saint-Gilloise. Aberdeen have a partnership with Atlanta United.And now, with the 49ers purchase, Rangers have a connection with Leeds United. But which club sits higher in the hierarchy? Scottish fans are insecure about their position in the food chain and the growth of multi-club ownership has only exacerbated that anxiety.Not every new American owner has been welcomed with open arms. Motherwell supporters last year voted against a takeover by US-based Erik and Courtney Barmack, a former Netflix vice-president and a Snap Inc executive. Foley, too, has faced questions. Should Hibernian really be a feeder club to Bournemouth, a team with an average attendance of just over 11,000 last season that had until fairly recently played most of its history in the lower leagues? Perhaps not, but this is the reality of the modern game.It’s also an indication of how Scottish soccer needs help. It’s been 40 years since a team not called Celtic or Rangers won the title. A study commissioned by the Scottish FA last year said the sport is “significantly underachieving” in youth potential compared to other countries of a similar size. Just 12% of all minutes in the Scottish Premiership last season were given to players age 21 or under.And while more Scottish teams are involved in Europe, none made it past the group stage of the most recent Conference League, a fact made starker by Irish side Shamrock Rovers’ run to the knockout phase last season. The hope was that the new third-tier competition would give Scottish clubs a platform to reach new heights. Instead, it has exposed just how far off the required standard they are.There’s no guarantee American money will change any of this. Nelms has been in charge at Dundee for over a decade, but has yet to turn the club into the talent factory he originally planned. St Johnstone suffered relegation for the first time in 16 years last season not long after the arrival of new owners. Their fans expected more.The history of Scottish soccer and the passion of its fans is part of what makes it so attractive to outsider investors. So too is the sense that the Scottish game, with some new ideas and renewed ambition, could be something more. The American dream has taken on a tartan tinge.This article was amended on 16 July 2025. An earlier version said Auckland City were part of Bill Foley’s Black Knight network; in fact, it is Auckland FC that are part of this group.Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipUS sportsRangersCelticfeaturesShareReuse this content"

WHAT BREAK?Bigger Cup is up and running, baby, as we officially wave goodbye to“last season”and welcome “this season”. The question of when we enter a new campaign is eternally asked; it’s like the quandary of where the north of England starts (anything aboveBristolStoke, if you were wondering), and Football Daily is happy to provide the definitive answer of … roundabout now. Tuesday’s first qualifying round second legs brought the drama Uefa desperately needs to make the competition entertaining before the drudge of matches from September to January. Unfortunately for the suits in Switzerland, almost certainly none of the teams currently playing in the qualifying rounds will reach the league stage but we should let Hamrun Spartans, Lincoln Red Imps and Drita dream … for a bit. At the same time, the prospect of facing Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Liverpool and FC Basel is over for another year for the likes of The New Saints, Differdange 03 and Virtus, who will have to wipe away the tears, pull their socks up and go again in Tin Pot.Permanent Welsh champions TNS went down to a 116th-minute own goal against Macedonia’s Shkendija to lose 2-1 on the night and on aggregate. Football Daily might even have watched it on S4C due to our commitment to the underdog and love of Welsh commentary. “There is one thing everyone can be proud of through the club, it’s that everyone gave everything that they had,” chirped manager Craig Harrison. “No one could give anything more and sometimes that’s all you can ask.” There was greater cruelty for Lithuania’s Zalgaris, who last won a two-legged Big Cup tie in 2000, as they were sent packing by Malta’s mighty Hamrun Spartans 11-10 on penalties after 28 spot-kicks. It is the first time a Maltese side have made it beyond this round, becoming part of football history in the process.Even in defeat there can be triumph. Andorra’s national team are ranked 173rd in the world, therefore when their best and brightest, Inter Club d’Escaldes, drew Romanian giants FCSB, who won the competition back in the 1986 by beating Barcelona, when they were known as Steaua, no one gave them a chance. Inter Club d’Escaldes obviously lost over two legs because FCSB possess the former Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches and ex-Port Vale man Dennis Politic. Respectfully beaten 3-1 in the Romanian capital, a lesser team would have given up and gone through the motions. But Inter Club could not let down the 509 fans inside the Nou Estadi Encamp and ran out 2-1 winners, exiting by a single-goal margin. The names of Sascha Andreu and Alexandre Llovet will be sung on the streets of Escaldes–Engordany for years to come.Dynamo Kyiv, Slovan Bratislava and CrvenaZvezda enter in the next round, readying themselves to bring their lesser-known rivals back down to earth and restore the natural order at the top of the second qualifying round tree. Come May, the ending will doubtless be the same given that the biggest clubs win the biggest prizes, but the summer months provide a reminder that football is more than just millionaires battling for trinkets and there is still glory to be had for those other professionals who can say they are Bigger Cup players. The evolution of the football season is well and truly under way.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Sarah Rendell from 8pm BST for Euro 2025 quarter-final MBM coverage of Norway 2-1 Italy.QUOTE OF THE DAY“As you may be aware, other clubs seem to go through much more protracted disputes with less severe outcomes.

Every other team wants to replicate what England did in 2022, what the Netherlands did before us, and really boost women’s football and we know that success comes from that.Williamson ready to put Arsenal friendship aside for Blackstenius and Sweden testRead more“We know that we’re very fortunate in England that when we have success it really does explode the game and I think it’s what we want all over Europe and all over the world.”The meteoric growth of women’s football in England afterthe Lionesses’ success at Euro 2022is a bonus, though not their “why” as a team. “My main reason for winning the tournament is to lift the trophy,” Bronze said. “But a part and parcel of success is that it helps build the women’s game and that’s something that obviously I want to happen in England more and more.”Bronze is competing at her seventh major tournament with England. Kosovare Asllani, who joined Sweden’s coach, Peter Gerhardsson, in facing the media, is competing in her eighth. “It’s a bit like the fun starts now,” the midfielder said. “It’s always a tough game. England have a lot of talented players whereas our biggest strength lies in the way we play as a team.”Bronze said: “Someone mentioned that Asllani said it’s going to be fun. My interpretation of that is that this is two teams that are in this game to win it, no sitting back, both very talented, athletic, physical and everything that you think of in a football game could happen because both teams are at the top level.”The teamsare very familiar with each other. Many of Sweden’s squad play in the Women’s Super League and the countries met in the 2019 World Cup bronze medal match, with Sweden the victors, in the Euro 2022 quarter-finals, with England winning, and shared the spoils in the Nations League last season, with two draws.View image in fullscreenKosovare Asllani trains alongside her Sweden teammates ahead of the meeting with England.Photograph: Ludvig Thunman/Bildbyrån/Shutterstock“We respect England, the team they have and everything they have achieved so far,” Asllani said. “Do we fear them? No. We don’t have the word fear in our dictionary. We look up the word courage. Of course, you have to respect one of the best sides in the world and we have the perfect gameplan for this match. I feel a sense of longing to start the game. We want to go out and play our football intensely and physically. In our minds there is only one outcome and that is to win.”The key to success for England is focusing on themselves on and off the pitch. “Coming off the back of the France game and having a lot of talking points actually brought the team closer together,” Bronze said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re not focused too much on noises around other teams or ourselves. We’re only focused on what we do on the training pitch, what we do in games, how we recover, how we perform and how we lift each other up.”Bronze also went deeper on whatthe mantra of being “proper England”means. “We have a lot of younger players and new players who have very different experiences of playing for England compared to the likes of myself, who know that England used to have to dig deep all the time,” she said. “The 2015 World Cup was the first time we beat Germany – that’s insane to think about now – but England in the past had to dig out performances and was the underdog, not the favourite.“This England team has developed from there, football has changed. Obviously we’re a very talented team, with a lot of technical and tactical ability, but we don’t want to ever forget that we are England, we are ‘proper England’, and if push comes to shove we can win a game in any means possible.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Lucy BronzeEngland women's football teamSweden women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

I think they understand clearly where we’re coming from. We talked through some of the challenges that we have so we’ve got a good dialogue with them.”Max Faulkner and ‘the greatest shot’: the story of Portrush’s first Open championRead moreAbout 120,000 spectators watched the Open when it was last held in Turnberry. However, the event has grown to such an extent that 280,000 fans will be in Portrush.Darbon, who is overseeing his first Open, said there had been 1.2 million applications for tickets for this week’s event and the R&A was “keen to service that demand where we can”. However, he left open the door to a return to Turnberry by promising to work collaboratively with national and local government to improve transport links and accommodation levels at the South Ayrshire course.That was a notable shift in tone compared with his predecessor, Martin Slumbers, who had suggested that bringing the Open to Trump’s course would be too toxic and take the focus away from the golf.“I think we’ve been extremely clear on our position in respect of Turnberry,” Darbon said. “We love the golf course but we’ve got some big logistical challenges there. You see the scale of their setup here and we’ve got some work to do on the road, rail and accommodation infrastructure.”View image in fullscreenAbout 120,000 spectators watched the Open when it was last held in Turnberry in 2009.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianIn February, it was reported that White House officials had asked about Turnberry returning as an Open venue during the prime minister’s visit to Washington. King Charles also referenced the course in a letter inviting the president to a second state visit to the UK in September.However, Darbon said the government had not put any pressure on them to accelerate a return to the Scottish course that Trump bought for £39m in 2014.“We’ve spoken to them specifically about Turnberry and I think they’ve made it clear that the decision around where we take our championship rests with us,” he said. “We’ve explicitly not taken it out of our pool of venues but we’d need to address those logistical challenges should we return.”The R&A expects to announce the venue for the 2028 Open before the middle of next year – a timescale that would come too soon for Turnberry. However, Portmarnock in the Republic of Ireland is being considered as a venue in what would be a historic move with the Open being held outside the United Kingdom for the first time.Elsewhere, Darbon alsoconfirmed the Guardian story last weekthat the R&A would be moving the tee times forward on Saturday to avoid a clash with a loyalist march by the Portrush Sons of Ulster.More than 60 bands and 2,000 participants are expected to begin their march through the town streets shortly after thousands of spectators will be leaving the sold-out Royal Portrush, and Darbon said the tweak was needed to ensure “both events can run as seamlessly as possible”.He said: “We’re making a slight tweak to tee times to try and finish – it’s not dramatic. It’ll be 15 minutes or so earlier. At the same time, this is an outdoor sport. The weather can play a big role. It’s very difficult to be precise on finishing times. But we’re looking at some marginal adjustments.”Darbon refused to deny reports that the R&A had offered the group £20,000 to stage their march on a different day. “We’re actually contributing some incremental costs to support what I just said, the seamless operation of both events. We try to be good citizens in the communities in which we operate when we come to town.”Explore more on these topicsThe OpenDonald TrumpEuropean TourPGA TourGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

The move is as sensational as it is unprecedented towards a player of Clark’s standing. The 31-year-old represented the US in the last Ryder Cup.Max Faulkner and ‘the greatest shot’: the story of Portrush’s first Open championRead morePhotographs emerged of damage inflicted to lockers by Clark during the US Open last month. Clark had attracted attention at the US PGA Championship in May for throwing his driver at a sign during another temper tantrum.When asked about the US Open incident, Clark said: “I’ve had a lot of highs and lows in my career, especially this year some lows. I made a mistake that I deeply regret. I’m very sorry for what happened. But I’d also like to move on, not only for myself but for Oakmont, for the USGA [United StatesGolfAssociation] and kind of focus on the rest of this year and things that come up.”Oakmont is clearly unwilling to draw a line under the incident. In a letter to members this week, first obtained by Golf Digest, club president John Lynch outlined Clark’s punishment. “Following multiple discussions with the USGA and the OCC board, a decision has been made that Mr. Clark will no longer be permitted on OCC property,” Lynch said.“Reinstatement would be contingent upon Mr Clark fulfilling a number of specific conditions, including full repayment for damages, a meaningful contribution to a charity of the board’s choosing, and the successful completion of counselling and/or anger management sessions.”Clark held off Rory McIlroyto win the US Open at Los Angeles Country Club in 2023. His best major finish so far this year is a tie for 46th at the Masters. The US Open will return to Oakmont in 2033. Clark will begin his latest quest for the Open at 10.20am on Thursday in the company of Corey Conners and Tom Hoge.Explore more on these topicsGolfPGA TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The galleries grew and grew. The venue for the Open this week was the site of a starstruck McIlroy meeting Clarke on his 10th birthday in 1999. Clarke’s foundation played a key role in the early development of McIlroy. McKibbin, as a 13-year-old playing at McIlroy’s home club in Holywood, was invited by him to play in the Irish Open’s pro-am in 2016. The connections are as uplifting as they are strong.Clarke’s description of seeing McIlroy win the Masters in April, completing his set of majors, is therefore understandable. “I watched every shot,” Clarke says. “I couldn’t take my eyes off it. Rory winning there was almost like watching my two boys, Tyrone and Conor, win. I was that emotional.McIlroy vows ‘the story isn’t over’ as he revels in Royal Portrush support at the OpenRead more“I have known Rory for so long, I know his talent and his journey. To get over the line and do it, in true Rory fashion keeping us on the edge of our seats until the very end … It was destiny for Rory to join that exalted company. I was very proud just watching it. If I gave a 0.0001% help in his journey then brilliant but it was more pride, knowing him as I do. It isn’t often you will watch something and feel like you are watching your own two boys play.”Clarke has never claimed any credit for McIlroy’s achievements. That will not change. McKibbin and Shane Lowry also had involvement with Clarke’s foundation. “I was just trying to help,” he says. “I don’t seek publicity for it because that isn’t why I do it. Half of my foundation is to support breast cancer research [his first wife, Heather, died of the disease in 2006], half is to help the development of junior golf in Ireland, so that is all close to my heart.”The 56-year-old recalls not only that 1999 meeting but the early buzz around McIlroy. “I am not saying this to be all ‘I told you so’ but you could see back then how good he was, how much potential he had,” Clarke says. “Now, potential and turning into the player that he has become are two different things but the talent he showed even from that age was just incredible. He was gifted, totally gifted.”All evidence suggests McIlroy has rediscovered his mojo after a brief post-Masters lull. Clarke knows the scenario; his life was hugely altered by lifting the Claret Jug in 2011. “I’m not in any shape or form comparing what I did with Rory but when you search and go for so long trying to achieve your goals, sometimes it is hard to have a reset afterwards,” Clarke says. “He has achieved what only five other people in the history of our game have, so it’s no wonder there is a reset for him. The reception he will get at Portrush will be unbelievable.”View image in fullscreenDarren Clarke holds the Claret Jug after winning the 2011 Open at Royal St George’s in Sandwich, Kent.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianClarke’s own situation is fascinating on two fronts. He was on course to make the cut in 2019 before a nightmarish triple-bogey seven on his 36th hole. Clarke returns to the Dunluce Links, where the 9th hole has been named after him, knowing this could be his final Open. Motivation stems in part from events of six years ago.“I was fuming,” he admits. “All my years of experience and to do that on the last hole … I had played so nicely. It wasn’t steam coming out of my ears, it was lava. The ‘new me’ as I get older? Bollocks to that! That irritated me a lot. It hurt me. I have never played tournaments just to make that cut but I was comfortably inside the line and to do that was beyond frustrating.”Bombs and shootings became part and parcel of life. You were always waryClarke is undecided on whether this Open will mean goodbye. He remains not only hugely competitive on the Champions Tour in the US but a prodigious worker. “I had gone through a spell of missing the Open cut too many times in a row but last year I actually played OK without having a great weekend. This year I have been playing really nicely without putting well. So I will see, I don’t know. I really haven’t made my mind up. If it gets to the stage where I think I have no chance of having a semi decent week, of making the cut, then I definitely won’t play.“I love Portrush, that goes without saying. It is just a very special place for me. If this is to be my last one, there isn’t a better place. I am determined to really enjoy this one. Sometimes, I have tried so hard that I haven’t been able to enjoy where I am.”Clarke was a staunch advocate of the Open’s return to Portrush after a 68-year hiatus. Peter Dawson, the former chief executive of the R&A, took on the case.“I kept chirping at Peter’s ear,” Clarke says. “I think he ended up trying to avoid me at all costs. It was a bold move on his behalf to commit to bringing the Open to Portrush. It was great the last time; this one will be even better. They could easily just have come back for one but they didn’t, they committed.”View image in fullscreenDarren Clarke tees off at the 1st to start day one of 2019 Open at Royal Portrush. His participation ended with a triple-bogey seven on his 36th hole.Photograph: David Davies/PAClarke encountered the Troubles. He comprehends what it means for Northern Ireland to showcase itself now on a global sporting stage. “Bombs and shootings became part and parcel of life,” Clarke says. “You were always wary. I think playing golf and playing in tournaments all over Ireland from a young age got me thinking there was more going on, about what was happening back home not making any sense. We have come an awful long way from that.“That’s not at all to say other places in the world haven’t had bad times but you grew up in a tough time. I was fortunate my parents gave me everything to allow me to play golf, which in turn let me see what opportunity was possible back in those days.”The final words, and intriguing ones, are for McKibbin. “I have spent a lot of time with Tom, we have the same coach,” Clarke says. “He is the real deal. He just flushes the ball. He is eager, he wants to learn so much.” It feels sensible to take note.Explore more on these topicsThe OpenDarren ClarkeRory McIlroyEuropean TourPGA TourGolfUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump announced $70bn in AI and energy investments there.“This collaboration with Brookfield is a significant step forward, ensuring clean energy supply in the PJM region where we operate,” Amanda Peterson Corio, Google’s head of datacenter energy, said in a statement.Over roughly the last year, Google has struck several first-of-a-kind power purchase agreements, including for carbon-free geothermal energy and advanced nuclear. The company is also working with the country’s largest electricity grid operator, PJM Interconnection, to use AI to speed up the process of hooking up new power supplies to the grid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Phone 3 is London-based Nothing’s latest attempt to get people to ditch Samsung or Apple phones for something a bit different, a little quirky and more fun.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As the firm’s first high-endAndroidin several years, it has most of what you’d expect a flagship phone to have. But where it tries to set itself apart is with slick, dot-matrix-inspired software and a design on the back that includes a small, unique LED screen.Costing from £799 (€799/$799/A$1,509) the Phone 3 is double the price of the company’sgreat mid-range efforts, making it a direct challenger to the SamsungGalaxy S25,Google’s Pixel 9and theiPhone 16.View image in fullscreenThe back screen shows icons, the battery or volume level, or notifications such as WhatsApp messages.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianNothing first introduced its semi-transparent designwith earbudsand then followed up with thePhone 1 in 2022, which added “glyph” LEDs on the back that flashed in fancy patterns for notifications. For the Phone 3 those glyph lights have morphed into a small round matrix of LEDs in the top right of its back displaying icons, animations and patterns.It is used for more than simple notifications and can now display various gimmicky “toys” such as amagic eight ball, a stopwatch or, cringingly, aspin the bottlegame that can be triggered by a touch-sensitive button the back. More useful is the ability to show the time, the volume, charge status or a persistent icon for a notification or app of your choice.View image in fullscreenFrom the front, the Phone 3 looks like a regular handset.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe rest of the back of the device divides opinion with a quirky arrangement of shapes and elements. Those who crave symmetry will hate it.The front screen is, at least, a regular 6.7in OLED display with slim bezels and a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. It is crisp, colourful and bright, though a little subject to glare on very sunny days.SpecificationsScreen:6.7in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (460ppi)Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 4RAM:12 or 16GBStorage:256 or 512GBOperating system:Nothing OS 3.5 (Android 15)Camera:50MP main, 50MP 3x tele and 50MP ultrawide, 50MP selfieConnectivity:5G, eSIM, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6 and GNSSWater resistance:IP68Dimensions:160.6 x 75.6 x 9mmWeight:218gSnappy but hotView image in fullscreenTaking selfies using the glyph matrix screen as a viewfinder still requires quite a lot of guesswork to line up a proper shot.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Phone 3 has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 chip, which is a step down from the latest top Snapdragon 8 Elite processor used in most flagship Android competitors. Its slightly weaker performance isn’t noticeable in day-to-day usage and it simply flies along. It can even handle games pretty well, though those seeking the absolute best performance should look elsewhere as the phone got uncomfortably hot with demanding graphics tests.The battery life is a solid, though not class-leading, 40 hours between charges with plenty of 5G usage. Most people will need to charge it every other day, or less if used more sparingly. That matches thetwo-year-old Phone 2and is a little behind similar rivals.The battery fully charges in about 55 minutes using a 65W or greater USB-C power adaptor (not included), hitting 50% in just 19 minutes. The phone also has 15W wireless charging.Nothing OS 3.5View image in fullscreenNothing OS has a fun pop-colour and monochrome style with little dot-matrix icons, animations and sounds.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe phone ships with Nothing’s take on last year’s Android 15, which is highly stylised with a dot-matrix look and is easily customisable. A more regular Android style is available for those who need colour to identify their apps.Otherwise the software is slick and clutter-free, with all the usual services from Google available, plus a few Nothing apps such as the weather or voice recorder. The Essential Space app, first launched with thePhone 3a Pro, now includes the ability to voice-record while face down with an animation on the glyph screen and transcription using a cloud service. Essential Search is an AI-powered search of content across your phone and data, plus the ability to answer simple queries.View image in fullscreenEssential Space collects screens, notes and recordings, and uses AI to try to understand and summarise them, with varying degrees of success.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianNothing is promising an upgrade to Android 16 in the third quarter of 2025 and will provide five years of Android version updates and a total of seven years of security updates. That’s a couple of years short of the best from Google and Samsung. Also note that media apps such as Netflix currently do not support HDR content playback on the Phone 3 due to certification restricting it to SDR video.CameraView image in fullscreenThe Nothing camera app is fairly simple, but includes most of the tools you need to get the shot.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Nothing has three 50-megapixel cameras on the back and a 50MP selfie camera on the front. The main camera is the best of the bunch, shooting detailed and solid images, while the 3x optical zoom camera is almost as good, maintaining great detail and sharpness in bright scenes. The in-sensor zoom to 6x is OK, as is the digital zoom to 10x in good light, but the image degrades as you magnify further. The ultrawide camera is the weakest of the three, producing photos that look great in full view but lack detail when zoomed in and with obvious warping around the edges of the frame.Outdoors in bright light they capture great photos, but switching between the three cameras can result in different colour balances and tones, which isn’t ideal. They can also be oddly grey when shooting indoors, with inconsistent tone, sometimes shooting great photos but at other times coming out dull with repeated shots.The selfie camera is pretty good and captures a lot of detail. The 3x telephoto camera has a macro mode for closeup shots from about 10cm away, which is always fun.Overall, the Phone 3’s camera can be good but inconsistency keeps it from being as great as rivals at this price.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe optical fingerprint reader under the screen is fast and pretty accurate, but positioned quite low on the display.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery will maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for at least 1,400 full charge cycles. The phone isgenerally repairablein the UK.The device is made of recycled aluminium, copper, plastic, steel, tin and other materials accounting for 17.6% of the weight. It has a carbon footprint of 53.2kg CO2 equivalent. The company publishessustainability reports.PriceThe Nothing Phone 3 costs from£799(€799/$799/A$1,509) with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.For comparison, thePhone 3a Procosts£394, theGoogle Pixel 9 Procosts£999, the Samsung Galaxy S25+ costs£999, theSamsung S25 Edgecosts£1,099and theOnePlus 13costs£899.VerdictThe Phone 3 is a good but not great Android from Nothing. It is more interesting than rivals, but you have to actively want something different for it to make sense as you can easily get better-performing and longer-lasting handsets at about this price.Nothing’s software is a strong point. It’s slick, customisable and well optimised. Seven years of security updates is good, even if isn’t launching on the latest Android version and you only get five years of upgrades. The glyph screen on the back is certainly novel, and the back’s semi-transparent design is eye-catching, even if it divides opinion. It is well made if a little on the heavy side, while the phone’s performance and battery life are solid if unremarkable.The inconsistent camera shows there’s still work to be done from Nothing, while its Essential Space AI tools show some merit, even if they’re a little basic at the moment.If you want a something a bit quirky-looking then the Nothing Phone 3 is it.Pros:great software, eye-catching back design with dot-matrix screen, solid performance, 3x telephoto camera, good screen, solid fingerprint scanner, fast charging, sub-£1,000, seven years of security updates.Cons:camera is inconsistent and can’t match the best, battery life could be better, AI features still a work in progress, not the latest version of Android and only five years of upgrades, lack of symmetry not to everyone’s taste.View image in fullscreenThe glyph matrix screen is a great idea with lots of fun little elements to customise for various apps, contacts and events.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesAndroidMobile phonesGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Both deals are aimed at mitigating supply chain risks after China limited the outgoing supply of rare earths earlier this year in response toDonald Trump’s sweeping tariffs.The deal, announced on Tuesday, guarantees Apple a steady flow of rare earth magnets free fromChina– by far the world’s largest producer. For Apple, the cost to support US magnet production pales in comparison to the long-term risk that it could lose access entirely to the critical components, analysts said.Nvidia becomes first company to reach $4tn in market valueRead more“We’re in an era where executives are willing to pay a significant premium for a reliable supply chain. They don’t want stoppage,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Rare earths are a group of 17 metals used to make magnets that turn power into motion, including the devices that make cellphones vibrate. They are also used in weapons, electric vehicles and many other electronics.China placed export restrictions on rare earths in April in response to Trump’s tariffs. Though the US and China reached a deal in June that has resolved much of the rare earths dispute, broader trade tensions continue to underscore demand for a non-Chinese supply.As part of the agreement,Applewill prepay MP $200m for a supply of magnets slated to begin in 2027. The companies did not disclose the length of the deal nor the volumes of magnets to be provided.The agreement calls for magnets produced from recycled material, in keeping with Apple’s longstanding goal of ending its reliance on the mining industry. They will be produced at MP’s Fort Worth, Texas, facility using magnets recycled at MP’s Mountain Pass, California, mining complex.“Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States,” Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, said in a statement.Las Vegas-based MP Materials’ stock price has nearly doubled since the government deal was announced. It has had remarkable turnaround since last year, when it contemplated merging with an Australian rival as profits plunged in what its CEO, Jim Litinsky, called a “very frustrating” pricing environment for rare earths.Bob O’Donnell, president at market research firm TECHnalysis Research, said Tuesday’s move “makes complete sense” given that Apple requires significant amounts of rare earth magnets for its devices.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The team behind his return reveal allTom ReganWed 16 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 10.01 EDTShareWhen you think ofNintendo, it’s almost impossible not to picture Donkey Kong. The ape that started it all, Donkey Kong’s tie-donning, barrel-launching arcade antics introduced Mario to the world and almost bankrupted Nintendo in the process, after a near-miss legal battle over alleged King Kong copyright infringement. Yet despite Donkers’ undeniable place in gaming history – and obligatory appearances in Smash Bros and Mario Kart – for the last few console generations, Donkey Kong platformers have been MIA. Enter DK’s first standalone adventure in 11 years, Donkey Kong Bananza.While Mario’s recent adventures saw him exploring the reaches of outer space or deftly possessing enemies with an anthropomorphic hat, DK’s grand return is all about primal rage. Employing a similar voxel-based technology to Minecraft, DK’s Switch 2 adventure swaps the former’s thoughtful Lego-esque world-building for gleeful destruction, letting players shatter every colourful level into smithereens.As you smash and punch your way through walls, floors and ceilings, you can burrow all the way to the ground below, forging new paths and unearthing hidden treasures. It’s a novel and enjoyably chaotic twist on the usually neatly ordered Nintendo platformer.“Bananza started when my superior, Koizumi-san, came to our team and asked us if we could create a 3D Donkey Kong game,” recalls Donkey Kong Bananza producer and Super Mario Odyssey director, Kenta Motokura. It was a full-circle moment, he tells me, with the plastic bongo-controlled Donkey Kong Jungle Beat starting off his career at Nintendo 25 years earlier. “The first time I ever played Donkey Kong was on Game and Watch, but as Donkey Kong became 3D, I started working on 3D games myself,” he says. “In Donkey Kong Jungle Beat Koizumi-san was director and I learned a lot from him in terms of taking on new challenges and figuring out the characteristics of Donkey Kong.”The question was, with Donkey Kong’s last foray into 3D being on the Nintendo 64, where would Nintendo take its monkey mascot next? Seeking wisdom from Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Motokura’s old boss, it wasn’t long until the team were drawn to DK’s gigantic, furry hands. “Speaking with Miyamoto-san, who had worked on the original and on developing the DK games with Rare, he said that he had focused on the power and the actions of Donkey Kong, such as the hand claps,” Motokura says. “We were testing voxel technology – we were actually using it in Super Mario Odyssey – and we thought that by bringing together and combining the power of Donkey Kong and the voxel technology, it would fit together with the theme of destruction.”View image in fullscreenKing Kong … DK is back on top.Photograph: NintendoMotokura and the Super Mario Odyssey team had their fair share of 3D platformer experience. But Bananza’s game director Kazuya Takahashi, who joined the project midway through development, had only worked on open world RPGs.“It wasn’t too intimidating,” Takahashi says about the pressure of reviving Donkey Kong, “because the team had worked on Odyssey as well, there were a lot of people on the team who had skills related to 3D platform action games.”Yet even with the team’s platforming pedigree, the voxel-based destruction presented a unique challenge for Nintendo’s Tokyo team. “For this sort of game, where you can destroy anything, there was no precedent,” Takahashi says. “So in that sense, we did struggle with various things. Developing the levels was quite challenging. For each stage, we wanted to make sure that the level would be fun even without that destruction element.”Luckily, the team wasn’t going in blind – they had help from an all-star playtester.“We had Miyamoto-san check the game occasionally,” says Motokura. “But instead of progressing through the game, he just stuck to one point, smashing and digging around a lot. It was a good thing to see him playing that way … it proved that there are a lot of things that players could potentially be curious about in the game.”To many Nintendo fans, there is no Mario or Donkey Kong without Nintendo veterans like Miyamoto or Takashi Tezuka, but the next generation of developers tell me they’re more than ready to carry on their mentors’ legacy. “Longtime developers like Miyamoto-san and Teztuka-san also allow us younger developers to discuss things on the same level, so in that sense, I think a lot of ideas are going to be shared among the developers,” Motokura says. “Newer, younger developers are also going to carry on the legacy of the developing that we do at Nintendo.”“Although I joined this team partway through, I really enjoyed the work that I was able to do on this team, and that Nintendo was very open to being able to explore these kinds of new and challenging concepts,” Takahashi reflects. “Having the freedom to find your own shortcuts in Bananza … In that sense, there’s an expanded level of freedom compared with Odyssey and we were really able to provide a completely new kind of gaming experience.”What to playView image in fullscreenOn deck … Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4.Photograph: Iron GalaxyLike most millenials, I’ve been reliving my mispent youth via the ultimate piece of playable noughties nostalgia:Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4. While there are some disappointing soundtrack omissions (and a bizarrely stripped-down take on 4’s original sandbox campaign), grinding and kickflipping your way across Rio, London, Canada and Alcatraz is still as compulsive as it was in the early 2000s. While players of the originals might grimace at the lack of Alien Ant Farm, Papa Roach and Less Than Jake, the addition of Denzel Curry, Turnstile, Fontaines DC, Drain, Vince Staples and Mastodon – whisper it – almost makes up for it. Almost.This time around, I’ve opted to flail and face-plant on Nintendo’s shiny new Switch 2. One of the first third-party releases on the platform, it’s a surprisingly solid port, allowing me to take my trick-tastic escapades with me wherever I go. Here’s hoping future Switch 2 ports fare as well. Ultimately, while this isn’t quite as lovingly made as Vicarious Vision’s 2020 1+2 remakes, when you’re in the zone and have that six-figure high score going, Pro Skater is still an arcade-like thrill that satisfies like little else.Available on:Switch 2, PS5, Xbox, PCEstimated playtime:20-2,000 hours, depending on how gnarly you areskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As Nintendo’s first major single-player Switch 2 game, it will set the quality bar for the console in the way Breath of the Wild did when the original Switch was released. But as the latest game from the team responsible for the exceptional 3D Mario series, it is already begrudged by someNintendofans as a distraction: what could possibly be so exciting about a tie-wearing gorilla to justify making Bananza ahead of another Super Mario Odyssey?Donkey Kong demolishes those concerns. He demolishes a lot in Bananza. It may resemble a Mario 64-style 3D platformer on the surface, with its themed worlds festooned with giant bananas to sniff out and collect, but DK’s fists show total disregard for the playground as built. All terrain is destructible. Mash the buttons and his powerful arms thump tunnels through hills, pound pristine lawns into muddy craters and tear up wodges of stone to swing as sledgehammers for even speedier landscaping. He is less a platforming mascot than a potassium-powered level editor.View image in fullscreenRepeatable joy … Donkey Kong Bananza.Photograph: NintendoOn a primal level, that’s almost enough to hold your attention. There’s an easy, repeatable joy in throwing a punch this well programmed: the jolt of pause as knuckles collide with rock, the snarl of Joy-Con 2 rumble, the way surfaces splinter before another hit brings down the entire wall. I can see Bananza having a second life as an executive stress reliever; a virtual rage room where you heave exploding boulders at cliffs to reduce them to pockmarked swiss cheese. You can even invite a co-op pal along to shoot projectiles from DK’s back and accelerate the chaos (or act as a devilish tag along to a player trying to avoid any carnage).There is motivation behind the mayhem. The existing Kong clan (getting some choice cameos that channel the comic spirit of Rare’s Donkey Kong Country games) is expanded by villainous mining Kongs set on snagging a treasure at the planet’s core. En route they kidnap Pauline, the young singer whom Donkey Kong originally snatched in his arcade debut. But Kong and Pauline are on better terms here: she coaxes animal superpowers by belting out powerful earworms straight into his skull. If my plot recollection seems hazy, it’s only because it’s been supplanted in my mind by her Latin pop ditty about the joy of being a zebra.View image in fullscreenA  strange world … Donkey Kong Bananza.Photograph: NintendoThis is a strange world but an even stranger platforming proposition. How do you design obstacles for a hero who can tunnel under laser fences or jackhammer doorways through barriers that would have stopped Mario in his tracks? Truthfully, it takes a beat to find the answers. There is an initial mushiness to worlds that can be excavated from any angle. Sometimes you blindly mine into rewards intended for challenges you have not yet uncovered or parsed, and the haphazardness of these unearned prizes has you wondering, for a second, if the game’s freeform audacity rings as hollow as the caves you’re punching into existence.But no. Later, rolling plains and jaunty lagoons make way for more dangerous landscapes, where solid ground protects you from poison swamps, icy lakes and lava. Down here, land is life, so your treatment of it becomes more deliberate, your strikes more surgical. When metal caterpillars gobble a wooden life raft or a pogoing menace punches through a platform you tenderised into a thin sliver, you suddenly appreciate the method in Nintendo’s morphable madness. Boss fights make exceptional use of fragile terrain, keeping DK from walloping chunks from their giant bodies by rendering arenas more and more uneven as fights unfold.The only fumble in these later stages is the overpowered nature of the Bananzas themselves. These animal transformations imbue DK with speed, flight, strength and more, and when contained in the challenges or levels built for them they sing. You are reminded of Mario’s Odyssey possessions and how perfectly realised each of those physical sensations was. But taken out of that context – when returning to earlier stages to mop up collectibles, for example – they become instant win buttons, dulling the ingenuity of Nintendo’s platforming designs.I’m not sure Bananza has the same legs as Mario Odyssey. Where that game blossomed in a rich, post-credit endgame, DK lives more in the moment: moving ever forward, chewing through new ideas and never stopping to pulverise the roses. Come the game’s epic climax, he has smashed through concrete, rubber, watermelon, ostrich eggs, entire Donkey Kong Country homages, glitter balls – even the NPCs he’s trying to protect. If the weight of Switch 2 does lie on his shoulders, that’s just one more tool to bash a hole in the universe. His appetite for destruction is infectious.Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendoNintendo Switch 2Platform gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

I use myiPhonenon-stop: four hours each day during school terms; eight during holidays. Snapchat matters most, but I’m often following friends on TikTok and Instagram.The prospect of not having access to any apps or the internet was just “ugh”. Part of me wanted to scream at the thought of being cut off by thisSagephone. Would it make me want to divorce my parents?I knew I was going to miss out. The Sage phone came loaded only with Google Maps, Spotify, Monzo, Uber, a calendar and the TfL Go transport app. None of that gave me much to do. There was messaging, but no one really uses messages and I can’t remember the last time I made a phone call to a friend.Let’s start with the positives. Because the phone was so boring, I didn’t want to use it, [I] put it down and chatted more with my family. I spent less time in my room and was more productive – I even wrote this piece!The people at Sage said it could take a month to get used to the limitations, but I don’t have that long to test it. I can already tell you that if you are a teenager you are going to feel disconnected from all of your friends and the rest of the world and that feels unfair. Having TikTok and Instagram is the way the world is wired now. If you take them away then it’s quite hard to stay in the loop.If I stayed with this phone I would also end up feeling left out when speaking in real life to my friends as this is where so many of our sayings and jokes come from.Social media is the way we know what everyone is up to and without it I felt I would be left out of the goings-on. We know social media is distracting, but it’s important to our social world now. During GCSEs some of my friends deleted apps, but they all ended up redownloading them within two days.I’m not as worried about the harms as many adults are. I made some of my closest friends through playing Roblox during the Covid lockdown and that’s not allowed on this phone. I wasn’t addicted to it. It was just fun. I have lots of friends from other schools who I might not text or talk to for weeks at a time, but through Snap I can stay in contact with them, see what they are up to and exchange things like videos that keep our relationships going in a way that wouldn’t happen with just phones. It has become a social glue and without it our networks might fall apart.It’s true that there are people who are negatively affected by exposure to TikTok accounts promoting a particular image of beauty. So this limited phone could prevent that and reduce the risk of people struggling with body image.And if your parents insist on you having a “dumb” phone, I think this could be an effective way to eliminate the shame of having a “brick” phone. If you were out with your friends and people were checking their phones it would be really weird to pull out a Nokia or not get a phone out.Overall, I understand the intentions and the appeal to parents, but unless everyone switched to Sage, I would miss out on too much.Explore more on these topicsSmartphonesInternet safetyYoung peopleSageiPhoneMobile phonesApplereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s clear what he gets out of it – not so much the British voterWed 16 Jul 2025 11.22 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 11.25 EDTShareApopular maxim on the American right is that politics is downstream from culture. In the UK, it increasingly feels like politics is simply downstream from the US. With Reform UK ascendant in the polls, Nigel Farage – officially MP for Clacton, unofficially Donald Trump’s emissary to the UK – is setting the terms of the national conversation, and he is importing them directly from across the pond.Over the past few months, Reform has sought tolaunch “Doge” initiatives(referencing Elon Musk’s department of government efficiency), waged war on DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) employment schemes, and called for the UK government to embrace crypto and create a bitcoin digital reserveat the Bank of England, following Trump’s lead. It seems the Brexiteers were right: Britain doesn’t make anything any more – not even its own bogeymen.Reform’s repeated attacks on DEI are particularly striking because DEI doesn’t technically exist in the UK. The equivalent framework is called EDI (equality, diversity and inclusion), and it is nowhere near as prominent as Reform seems to think. At the national level, Reform has claimed that cutting such equality and diversity schemes could save central government£7bn a year– according to 2022-23 figures, the real figure is £27m. Farage nonetheless insists that the British left “obsess about DEI and spend plenty of public money on it”. After Reform’s success at the local elections in May, he warned that all those working in diversity for Reform-controlled councils “better be seeking alternative careers very, very quickly”. But the sought-after image – woke council members walking out of county hall with their redundancy boxes while ordinary, hardworking Britons applaud the return to common sense – is unlikely to materialise. Arecent investigationby the Guardian found that in Reform’s 10 councils, the total number of jobs connected to equality and diversity amounts to fewer than five full-time positions and accounts for about 0.003% of their combined budget.Under Trump’s presidency, Doge has vastly overestimated the scale of its government savings – in one notable instance itmisfiledan $8m saving as an $8bn one – and DEI has been blamed for everything from a plane crash in Washington to wildfires in California to inflation. A sober assessment of the pros and cons of DEI initiatives – the benefits they can bring to companies, their approach to systemic inequalities that can be superficial box-ticking – has nothing to do with the rightwing backlash against them. Republicans aren’t looking for alternative solutions, because attacking DEI gives them everything they need: a way to foment resentment against state bureaucracy, the left, marginalised groups and minorities – appealing to xenophobia and serving capitalist interests at the same time.Why ape US ideas so transparently, especially in a country where even many on the right arerepulsed by Trump? One possible answer lies in semantics. Perhaps the hope is that DEI will sound like something new and scary to Britons who are no longer moved by mentions of previous bogeymen such as “political correctness”, “the bureaucrats in Brussels” and “the woke mob”, just as Doge will sound slicker and more exciting than “austerity” despite in practice meaning the same thing: stripping local councils down to their barest components – consistent with Westminster’s orders for the past 15 years. But shiny US branding will not make cuts any easier. An analysis of Reform’s 10 councils by PoliticsHome found that almost 80% of their combined spending is now taken up bysocial care and homelessness.Another explanation, however, is that Reform’s rhetoric is the symptom rather than the cause of a broader Americanisation of the British right. It is telling that Farage’s greatest asset in trying make DEI mean something has been GB News, itself a knockoff of Fox News, which has tirelessly warned of DEI’s evils – in the NHS, the army, the civil service and so on. (“It’s exasperating the number of hours I have wasted on various online ‘training packages’ on DEI topics,” an anonymous “senior soldier” revealed in a GB News exclusive, giving Britons a sense of what’s at stake.)GB News also recently announced plans to expand its coverage to the US with anightly show about American politicsfrom September. “We’ve seen time and again this year that a decision made on one day in Washington DC is felt the next day in Washington, Tyne and Wear,” GB News’s editorial director, Michael Booker, explained. Paul Marshall, the billionaire hedge fund manager who co-owns GB News, has deepened ties between the UK and US right through other ventures as well, such asUnHerd and the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship. Last year, afterbuying the Spectator, he also came close to purchasing the Telegraph with the help of Ken Griffin, an American billionaire who is one of the Republicans’ biggest donors.Marshall’s son Winston, a former banjoist for Mumford & Sons, is now a podcast host based in the US. At a recent press conference in Washington, he asked whether “the Trump administration would consider asylum” for citizens affected by the UK’s “free speech issues”. Trump’s press secretary said she would look into it.Big pay days and top of the polls: Nigel Farage’s first year as an MPRead moreThe special relationship forming between the UK and US right is tainted by the stark imbalances in wealth and power. Take away the vast wealth of its financial centre in London and the UK is poorer than each of America’s 50 states. The attempts by the British right to import panic about DEI and dynamism through Doge reflect a desire for inclusion and imagining that the UK and the US are in it together.It’s clear what Farage gets from this – the good graces of a US president who wants to be king and prizes sycophancy in his court above all – but the benefits to UK voters are naught. Farage has repeatedly declared his intention to give the British ruling classes a reality check through his success, implying that he alone knows what the UK wants. “I don’t think the Westminster politicians and journalists even get what’s going on out there,” he said in a recent TikTok video. But the references to DEI and Doge should remind us that he hasn’t a clue either.Samuel Earle is the author of Tory Nation: How One Party Took OverExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionNigel FarageDEI policiesDonald TrumpTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

We showed up because our communities want to live and thrive alongside our neighbors in an affordable city where no one is left behind, and because we want a mayor who believes in Palestinian human rights.The organization I work for, Jewish Voice for Peace Action, endorsed Zohran the same day he launched his candidacy. Our volunteers knocked on more than 80,000 doors, made hundreds of thousands of calls, and raised tens of thousands in grassroots dollars.While Zohran ran a unifying campaign, Andrew Cuomo used Islamophobic fearmongering, false accusations of antisemitism and unwavering support for Israel’s crimes in an attempt to divide our communities. It failed spectacularly.The Jewish community’s opinion about Israel and US policy is diverse and shifting rapidly. A poll from last November showed61%of Jews supported halting US weapons to Israel. Hundreds of thousands of Jews in the US are clear: the Israeli government is committinggenocideandapartheid, and our government must stop funding it. Many Jewish New Yorkers alongside our neighbors are desperate for elected representatives brave enough to say the truth, and it is refreshing to see a politician like Zohran with consistent values, whose progressive politics do not stop at our city’s borders.During a primary debate, every candidate was asked where they would first travel as mayor. Zohran replied that he would stay put inNew York. When moderators bafflingly began interrogating him on visiting Israel, he replied that he need not travel abroad to understand Jewish New Yorkers. He would meet us in synagogues, on the subways and wherever else we are in the city.For many Jews watching, we felt seen in our lives, in our diversity, and in our concerns right where we live. And we felt relief to hear a candidate refuse to position New York Jews as a proxy for a government committing genocide.The Zohran campaign represents a broad coalition committed to justice and dignity. Progressive Jews are proudly part of this coalition and will fight alongside our neighbors for a New York for all.Beth Miller is the political director of Jewish Voice for Peace Action‘Israel is more than a foreign policy issue’Elections are about choices. I didn’t support Zohran Mamdani in the NYC democratic primary; I voted for Brad Lander for mayor. But now that Mamdani won, I am supporting him, despite some of his positions, particularly on Israel. I hope that he will understand that concerns like mine are real.Israel is more than a foreign policy issue for many New Yorkers. Mamdani refuses to say that the chant “globalize the intifada” is dangerous, though he doesn’t use it. But it instills fear in many of us. He also is a staunch supporter of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), a movement that insists on cutting off Israeli institutions, which are considered “complicit”, even institutions or individuals who work with Arab citizens of Israel and those who oppose the occupation, as many artists and academics do.Mamdani has an opportunity to detoxify the Israel/Palestine debate among the left and within the Democratic party. He should acknowledge that there are two national struggles – Jewish and Palestinian – in one sliver of land, both deserving lives in dignity and freedom. He can be true to democratic socialist values along with other parties in the world: French, Germans, Scandinavians, all have put political might and money behind ending the occupation and investing in civil society inside Israel and a future Palestine.Of course, freedom of speech must be defended, but language that makes many of us feel unsafe – and has in fact led to violence and even deaths on US soil of innocent Jews, who were murdered simply because they were Jews, must not be excused.I was a founder of the Democratic Socialists of America,resigning decades ago. I know that the democratic socialist movement can be one of liberation for all, and for certain, it can be one that promotes equity and fairness to all New Yorkers. I hope that Mamdani governs as his own person, inspired by the values for equality that propelled him to the mayoralty.The Democratic party is a big tent, but to keep our tent inclusive we must seek dialogue and reconciliation, not incitement, to ensure that Mamdani achieves an extraordinary accomplishment at a time when our democratic underpinnings as a nation are at risk. This is an opportunity to forge a new path forward.Jo-Ann Mort is co-author of Our Hearts Invented a Place: Can Kibbutzim Survive in Today’s Israel?

TheUS supreme courtallowing the president effectively to abolish the Department of Education only reinforces this sense; Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissent, explicitly wrote that “the threat to our Constitution’s separation of powers is grave” – but she did not explain how to counter the threat.The picture is complicated by the fact thatwhat critics call“the stranglehold the checks and balances narrative on the American political imagination” has prevented positive democratic change. Hence it is crucial to understand where the separation of powers itself needs to be kept in check and where it can play a democracy-reinforcing role. Most important, we need counterstrategies against the Trumpists’ usurpation of what should remain separate powers.While pious talk of the founders’ genius in establishing “checks and balances” is part of US civil religion and constitutional folklore, the system in factnever functioned quite as intended. The framers had assumed that individuals would jealously guard the rights of the branches they occupied. Instead, the very thing that the founders dreaded as dangerous “factions” – what we call political parties – emerged already by the end of the 18th century; and thereby also arose the possibility of unified party government.We’re becoming inured to Trump’s outbursts – but when he goes quiet, we need to be worried | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreThe other unexpected development was the increasing power of the presidency; the founders had always seen the legislature as the potential source of tyranny; instead, the second half of the 20th century saw the consolidation of an “imperial presidency”, whose powers have steadily increased as a result of various real (and often imagined) emergencies. Some jurists evenblessed this development, going back toHamilton’s callfor an energetic executive, and trusting that public opinion, rather than Congress or the courts, would prove an effective check on an otherwise “unbound executive”.The dangers posed by unified party control and a strong presidency were long mitigated by the relative heterogeneity of parties in the US; internal dissent meant that Congress would often thwart an executive’s agenda. Less obviously, Congress’s creation of largely independent agencies, acting on the basis of expertise, as well as inspectors general within the executive itself established an internal system of checks. It also remains true, though, that, compared with democracies such as Germany and the UK, an opposition party in the US doesnot have many rights(such as chairing committees) or ways of holding a chief executive accountable (just imagine if Trump had to face a weekly prime minister’s question time, rather than sycophantic Fox hosts).Most important, though, the executive itself tended to respect the powers of other branches. But Trump: not so much. In line with his governance model, of doing something plainly illegal and then seeing what happens, Trump is usurping powers reserved for the legislature. He uses money as he sees fit, not as Congress intended; he, not Congress, decides which departments are necessary. The tariff madness could be over if Congress called the bluff on a supposed “emergency” which justifies Trump’s capricious conduct of slapping countries with apparently random levies. The most egregious example is his recent threat vis-à-vis Brazil which has nothing to with trade deficits, but is meant to help his ideological ally, former president Jair Bolsonaro, escape a criminal trial for a coup attempt.Trump is also destroying the internal checks within the executive. Inspectors general have been fired; independent agencies are made subservient to the president – in line with the theory of a “unified executive” long promoted by conservative jurists. The US supreme court, occupied to 67% by Maga has been blessing every power grab. As the legal scholarSteve Vladeck noted, the court has granted Trump relief in every single emergency application since early April, with seven decisions – like this week’s on the Department of Education – coming with no explanation at all. If this were happening in other countries, one would plainly speak ofa captured court, that is to say: one subordinated to the governing party. Ascommentatorshave pointed out, it is inconceivable that this court would simply rubber-stamp a decision by a President Mamdani to fire almost everyone at the Department of Homeland Security.The supreme court is cracking down on judges – and letting Trump run wild | Steven GreenhouseRead moreStill, the main culprit is the Republican party in Congress. There is simply no credible version of “conservatism” that justifies Trump’s total concentration of power; and anyone with an ounce of understanding of the constitution would recognize the daily violations. This case can be made without buying into the separation of powers narrative criticized by the left (though what they aim at is less the existence of checks as such, but the empowerment of rural minorities in the Senate and the proliferation of veto points in the political system, such that powerful private interests can stop popular legislation).Paradoxically,Democratsshould probably make Congress even more dysfunctional than it already is: use every procedural means to grind business to a halt and explain to the public that – completely contrary to the founders’ anxieties – the emasculation of the legislature is causing democracy’s demise (it never hurts to slip in such gendered language to provoke the Republican masculinists).Of course, one might question what role public opinion can really play as a check, and whether there’s still such a thing at all given our fragmented media world: it never constrained the George W Bush administration’s “global war on terror” in the way that Hamilton’s self-declared disciples had hoped. But it’s still the best bet. After all, there is a reason why some jurists see “we the people” asthe fourth branchthat ultimately makes the difference.Jan-Werner Müller is a Guardian US columnist and a professor of politics at Princeton UniversityExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionUS supreme courtSonia SotomayorUS CongressDonald TrumpRepublicansDemocratscommentShareReuse this content"

But AI has turbocharged themEdna BonhommeWhen AI is (badly) informing health policy and enabling bad actors, it’s time to regulate the tech companiesWed 16 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 14.15 EDTShareNearly a year into parenting, I’ve relied on advice and tricks to keep my baby alive and entertained. For the most part, he’s been agile and vivacious, and I’m beginning to see an inquisitive character develop from the lump of coal that would suckle from my breast. Now he’s started nursery (or what Germans refer to as Kita), other parents in Berlin, where we live, have warned me that an avalanche of illnesses will come flooding in. So during this particular stage of uncertainty, I did what many parents do: I consulted the internet.This time, I turned to ChatGPT, a source I had vowed never to use. I asked a straightforward but fundamental question: “How do I keep my baby healthy?”The answers were practical: avoid added sugar, monitor for signs of fever and talk to your baby often. But the part that left me wary was the last request: “If you tell me your baby’s age, I can tailor this more precisely.” Of course, I should be informed about my child’s health, but given my growing scepticism towards AI, I decided to log off.Earlier this year, an episode in the US echoed my little experiment. With a burgeoningmeasles outbreak, children’s health has become a significant political battleground, and the Department of Health and Human Services, under the leadership of Robert F Kennedy, has initiated a campaign titled theMake America Healthy Again commission,aimed at combating childhood chronic disease. The corresponding report claimed to address the principal threats to children’s health: pesticides, prescription drugs and vaccines. Yet the most striking aspect of the report was the pattern of citation errors and unsubstantiated conclusions. External researchers and journalists believed that these pointed to theuse of ChatGPT in compiling the report.What made this more alarming was that the Maha report allegedly includedstudies that did not exist. This coincides with what we already know about AI, which has been found not only to include false citations but also to “hallucinate”, that is, to invent nonexistent material. The epidemiologist Katherine Keyes, who was listed in the Maha report as the first author of a study on anxiety and adolescents,said:“The paper cited is not a real paper that I or my colleagues were involved with.”The threat of AI may feel new, but its role in spreading medical myths fits into an old mould: that of the charlatan peddling false cures. During the 17th and 18th centuries, there was no shortage of quacks selling reagents intended to counteract intestinal ruptures and eye pustules. Although not medically trained, some, such asBuonafede VitaliandGiovanni Greci, were able to obtain a licence to sell their serums. Having a public platform as grand as the square meant they could gather in public and entertain bystanders, encouraging them to purchase their products, which includedbalsamo simpatico(sympathetic balm) to treat venereal diseases.RFK Jr’s ‘Maha’ report found to contain citations to nonexistent studiesRead moreRFK Jr believes that he is an arbiter of science, even if the Maha report appears to havecited false information. What complicates charlatanry today is that we’re in an era of far more expansive tools, such as AI, which ultimately have more power than the swindlers of the past. This disinformation may appear on platforms that we believe to be reliable, such as search engines, or masquerade as scientific papers, which we’re used to seeing as the most reliable sources of all.Ironically,Kennedyhas claimedthat leading peer-reviewed scientific journals such as the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine are corrupt. His stance is especially troubling, given the influence he wields in shaping public health discourse, funding and officialpanels. Moreover, his efforts to implement his Maha programme undermine the very concept of a health programme. Unlike science, which strives to uncover the truth, AI has no interest in whether something is true or false.AI is very convenient, and people often turn to it for medical advice; however, there are significant concerns with its use. It is injurious enough to refer to it as an individual, but when a government significantly relies on AI for medical reports, this can lead to misleading conclusions about public health. A world filled with AI platforms creates an environment where fact and fiction meld into each other, leaving minimal foundation for scientific objectivity.The technology journalistKaren Hao astutely reflected in the Atlantic:“How do we govern artificial intelligence? With AI on track to rewire a great many other crucial functions in society, that question is really asking: how do we ensure that we’ll make our future better, not worse?” We need to address this by establishing a way to govern its use, rather than adopting a heedless approach to AI by the government.Individual solutions can be helpful in assuaging our fears, but we require robust and adaptable policies to hold big tech and governments accountable regarding AI misuse. Otherwise, we risk creating an environment where charlatanism becomes the norm.Edna Bonhomme is a historian of scienceExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionHealthUS politicsRobert F Kennedy JrcommentShareReuse this content"

Naturally, he thought he could fix the Ukraine war with a real-estate deal. In exchange for a ceasefire,Vladimir Putinwould get to keep territory he had already seized.But before Putin was a politician he was a KGB agent who mourned the collapse of the Soviet Union. His idea of a fair solution begins with Ukraine’s total submission to an imperial Russian motherland.There is no evidence that Trump was ever appalled by that ambition or by atrocities committed in pursuit of it. But he does now declare himself “very unhappy” with the Russian president for intensifying hostilities in defiance of White House efforts to end the fighting. It isn’t the killing that upsets the US president, but the ingratitude. Trump was offering Putin a hefty slice of Ukraine (not that the land was his to give away) and all he wanted in return was grounds to boast of his credentials as a peacemaker. Russian refusal to trade on those terms makes the White House look impotent, which is a good way to rile a prickly potentate.The manifestation of that pique is an agreement to supply Ukraine with vital anti-missile defence systems and a threat to impose“severe” tariffson Moscow if a ceasefire isn’t forthcoming within 50 days.That is long enough for Trump to revert to his old habit of indulging the Kremlin. Also, his deadlines are famously elastic. It would be premature to celebrate the US president’s recognition that Putin has been “bullshitting” him as a symptom of strategic enlightenment, still less an affirmation of solidarity with Ukraine. The president who this week spoke of Kyiv’s right to self-defence is the same one who only five months ago scorned Volodymyr Zelenskyy as theauthor of his nation’s misfortuneand a trickster who beguiled Joe Biden into handing over precious US resources to a lost military cause. Favour denied and then bestowed can be withdrawn again. Such is the Trump way.The current position may be temporary. That doesn’t mean it lacks substance. The crucial change is that Zelenskyy and his European allies have convinced Trump that they are footing the bill for the war; that Ukrainian independence isn’t a rip-off.The first stage of that persuasion was the creation of aco-owned investment fundfor the exploitation of minerals, oil and gas in postwar Ukraine. Washington’s 50% notional share of those resources was presented as “repayment” for military aid.Then came the commitment by Nato members to raise their annual defence budgets to 5% of national income within a decade. The alliance’s annual summit last month was choreographed almost exclusively to frame that pledge as a personal tribute to Trump. It wasn’t an edifying spectacle. Mark Rutte, the Nato secretary general, didn’t dignify his office bycalling the US president “daddy”. But the show seems to have impressed its target audience. At his post-summit press conference, Trump spoke of European resolve with unusual warmth.That fondness was on display again this week in a broadcast from the White House, where Trump, with Rutte at his side, declared that “having a strong Europe is a very good thing”. He referred back to the “very successful”Natosummit, the 5% pledge and a new arrangement whereby missile defences badly needed by Ukraine – the uniquely effective Patriot system – will be bought on Kyiv’s behalf by its continental allies. Trump’s point was not that the cause is just but that the price is paid by someone else. (The shift in posture reflects a judgment that Europe is a better client than the Kremlin.) Nato dollars beat Putin’s bullshit. For now.That is a relief for Ukraine, but not much more. Patriots help provide cover for cities that have come under ferocious Russian bombardment, but they won’t much alter the balance of power on the wider battlefield. The Kremlin continues to eke out territorial gains at huge cost in casualties. Ukrainian forces continue to mount a heroic defence and sometimes pull off bravura feats of counterattack, but panache cannot resist sheer weight of population indefinitely.Putin’s plan is more arithmetic than strategy. He intends to keep feeding soldiers into the “meat-grinder”, as Russians call the front, until there aren’t enough Ukrainians left with the strength or weapons to fight back. That is why the economic front – especially sanctions that target Moscow’s ability to raise revenue from oil and gas exports – is so vital, and why Trump’s readiness to reinforce that effort, if sincere, would be truly significant.Putin might reasonably assume it is a bluff, or a passing whim. But the Russian president may also have overplayed his hand. He has less control over events than his biggest fans and most anxious detractors imagine. Kremlin propaganda cultivates the myth of the great and visionary leader bestriding history. That image is refracted through foreign lenses as the shadow of an omnipotent puppeteer, tugging at strings that pull down western democracies.The truth is still sinister but more banal. Putin is the boss of bosses in a gangster kleptocracy where the security services are the paramount clan. Ultranationalist ideology and a personality cult around the president are embedded in all public discourse as tests of loyalty. Who really believes what is hard to know when the penalties for saying the wrong thing are severe. The economy is geared for total war from top to bottom, from industries that churn out munitions to the signing-on fees for volunteers and compensation payments to bereaved families that sustain remote regions where soldiering is the only work.Putin has repeatedly told Russians they are engaged in an existential struggle with the west,equivalent to resistance against Nazi invasion in 1941. If he now stopped the war in exchange for a percentage of eastern Ukraine, it wouldn’t be the victory he has promised. He has mobilised patriotic fervour to silence doubt about the wisdom of the struggle and the implicit payback is national glory. If the fighting ends on more desultory terms, he will face angry mothers whose sons died in vain. He will have to find civilian jobs for disillusioned veterans. Those are problems he would rather defer. It is easier to keep riding the conveyor of death than step off it for a deal like the one Trump has in mind – a deal, it must be emphasised, that is still grotesquely generous in rewarding unprovoked aggression.Putin’s reluctance to take that option is not the choice of a strategic mastermind, but nor was thefull-scale invasion in February 2022. Plan A was to overrun Ukraine within days. The Russian president badly underestimated his adversary then. Plan B is slow butchery and patience, hoping the other side runs out of ammunition and will. Stringing Trump along may prove to have been another grave error of judgment. Ukraine and its more dependable allies must hope so, and press the advantage hard while it lasts.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionRussiaDonald TrumpVladimir PutinNatoEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

It is the fact that this massive corporation purports to set our future agenda at allWed 16 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 18.56 EDTShareAs we race headlong into our glorious AI-powered future,a long-forgotten flickfrom the noughties is gaining cult status by posing a simple question: are we on the road to Idiocracy?In the tradition of Bill and Ted, Idiocracy, a 2006 American sci-fi comedy, depicts an average guy transported 500 years into the future to find he is the smartest man on earth. A wrestler is president, people worship “the profit” and the world’s biggest corporation is a sports drink company whose market strategy has taken humanity to the brink of collapse.Idiocracy is not a flawless film; it’s jarring class eugenics and casual sexism seem more dated than its 20 years would suggest. But what it does brilliantly is challenge the assumption that the human race is on an uncontested journey to higher consciousness.This is a timely counterpoint to the zeitgeist about the self-evident benefits of machine learning built by large tech companies under the conceit of “artificial intelligence”.Australian government not suspending ads or posts on X amid antisemitic Grok chatbot incidentRead moreAlready we are seeing academic studies suggesting that Large Language Models are linked to cognitive decline, with a recent MIT study finding lower brain engagement among studentsusing GPTs in writing essays.We’ve also seen AI chatbots accused ofinducing vulnerable people to suicideand cheery predictions about the hollowing out ofentry-level knowledge economy jobswhich loom as our next intergenerational betrayal.The question is whether these dumb outcomes are features or bugs of our emerging information ecosystem. Evidence is mounting it is the former.Exhibit A is OpenAI’sEconomic Blueprint for Australia, an embarrassing document seeking rapid government adaptation, investment and minimalist regulation for “the most significant economic and strategic opportunity of our time”.You could drive a truck through the holes in OpenAI’s analysis: $115bn in predicted productivity improvements based on crude calculations of hours saved at work, with no trade-off for the costs of the jobs already being destroyed.To realise this promised dividend OpenAI says the government would need to lean intoresource-sucking datacentres, socialising the costs of energy and water, steamrolling communities and putting new pressures on the grid and fast-tracking development at the cost of the energy transition.As our creativity is being stolen and repurposed, trading off our collective empathy for automated culture, OpenAI wants us to “streamline and update copyright law”, with industry groups already pushing hard for ageneral right to mine our data.But these self-serving policy asks are not the worst of the OpenAI blueprint; it is the very fact that this massive corporation purports to set our future agenda at all, defining rather than responding to our collective needs. This design principle could represent the inflection point between a smart future and an impending Idiocracy.It is true this technology carries amazing power to synthesise information and challenge higher-order thinking in new and profound ways. OpenAI is right to describe the technology as “like electricity”, something that can illuminate the night sky. But would you get a power company to set the rules for electrical safety?The truth is OpenAI is nether open or intelligent: it’s a play to dominate a new technology on commercial terms for its material benefit, using their copious venture capital as a shield against competitors and a sword against government to create a policy environment to suit them. We are witnessing the next phase of their corporate history.ChatGPT is a compelling shopfront, but what if it is intellectual crack? It tricks us to feel smarter, more seen and even loved, while actually providing the opposite by convincing us to commoditise our collective intelligence.Short of returning to a genuine not-for-profit mission, OpenAI can never be a good-faith partner. Theirs is an operating model to be resisted but that relies on us having the time, the understanding and, yes, the leadership to do this intelligently.In the latest episode of my podcastBurning Platforms, one of the godfathers of artificial intelligence, Prof Toby Walsh, differentiates between the richness of distributed intelligence and the homogeneity of the concentrated intelligence that chatbots serve up.High-quality data is earned not stolen property; it is used mindfully to address problems humans identify, not commoditised to fill some market niche.While the tech broligarchs battle for world domination, maybe the smart money should be on the design and value of small data models, designed for purpose, not for producing mainstream slop and brain rot that chew up less energy and eradicate fewer jobs.Because of the power of the tech sector, all of whom have well-paid and well-positioned Canberra lobbyists, we also need to resist.

We know how that endsLarry ElliottThe chancellor’s emollient speech to City bosses this week was alarming. There are better ways to revive Britain’s fortunesWed 16 Jul 2025 10.42 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 13.53 EDTShareRachel Reeves was in full Iron Lady mode when she delivered herMansion House speechto the City’s finest this week. Regulation was acting like “a boot on the neck” of business, choking off enterprise and innovation. Cutting red tape would have a “ripple effect” on the whole economy. Regulators should not give way to the temptation of “excessive caution” but instead boldly regulate for growth. It could have been any Tory chancellor since Nigel Lawson speaking.If Reeves seriously believes this stuff she is heading for a rude awakening. Chancellors don’t need a crystal ball to tell them where financial deregulation leads; they can read the many books detailing what happened last time this was tried. The global financial crisis of 2008 came about because policymakers bowed to the pressure from big finance to sweep away “burdensome” regulations, pledging that more funds could be channelled into productive investment as a consequence.Instead of providing backing for startup businesses, easy money led to ever more reckless speculation and a giant credit bubble. The inevitable crash led to a deep recession, the bailout of the banks and – in a textbook example of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted – a tightening of regulations.By that point it was clear the Thatcherite experiment had failed. Britain’s manufacturing sector struggled while finance became an end in itself, abandoning what should have been its prime function: providing long-term capital for businesses. In their haste to liberate the economy, Thatcher and her supporters had ignored the warning delivered by Keynes in the 1930s. “Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise,” Keynes said. “But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation.”It is possible that Reeves is softening up the City with some deregulation now before walloping its high rollers withhigher taxes on wealthin the autumn budget. If so, she could justifiably argue that the better-off were the main beneficiaries of rising share and house prices as a result of the £900bn pumped into the economy by the Bank of England through its money creation programme. The FTSE 100 roseabove 9,000 pointsfor the first time this week.But while it would be nice to think the Mansion House speech was part of a cunning plan to squeeze the rich, it doesn’t feel that way. A more likely explanation for her deregulatory zeal is that the chancellor fears the economy is becoming stuck in a doom loop and in those circumstances any growth is better than no growth.Reeves is right to be worried because the economy is not in a good place. Activity as measured by gross domestic productcontracted in both April and May, while inflation picked up to3.6% in June.The increase in employers’ national insurance contributions has made businesses reluctant to hire and the public finances are in a bad state. Borrowing is high andthe U-turnson the winter fuel allowance and welfare payments, coupled with weak growth, mean Reeves is on course to break her self-imposed fiscal rule.To avoid doing so will require tax increases – and over the next few months there will be endless speculation as to how much will be raised and who is going to pay it. This is a rerun of last year, when the prospect of higher taxes hit both business and consumer confidence, slowing the economy in the process. There is an obvious risk that higher taxes stall the economy, adding to pressure for further austerity measures. Hence the doom loop.Borrowing more so that tax increases can be avoided might sound attractive but is fraught with risk. The bond markets have been keeping a close eye on the UK ever since Liz Truss’s disastrous premiership three years ago, and if Reeves did decide to break her fiscal rules the government would almost certainly end up paying more – and possibly a lot more – in debt interest. Historically, Labour governments have been at their most vulnerable to a financial crisis in their second and third years.So, it’s not hard to see why stronger growth is a more attractive option for the chancellor and there are ways of getting it. For a start, the Bank of England needs to sharpen up its act. With the economy on the brink of recession, the Bank’s monetary policy committee should be cutting borrowing costs by more than 0.25 percentage points each quarter.Threadneedle Street is also making life more difficult for Reeves by gradually selling back the bonds it bought under its quantitative easing programme in the 2010s and early 2020s. This is leading to lower bond prices and higher government debt interest costs than would otherwise be the case. This process – known as quantitative tightening (QT) – should be halted.It is also absurd for the government to be proposing cuts in welfare while the commercial banks are being paid interest at 4.25% on their risk-free reserves being held at the Bank of England. In 2023, NatWest, Barclays, Lloyds and Santander receivedmore than £9bn between them– a rise of 135% on the previous year. There are far better uses for this money.Reeves could order the Bank to halt QT and she could stop the payouts to the commercial banks. Judging by her Mansion House speech she would rather rely on the financial sector to dig her out of a hole. Good luck with that, chancellor.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)OpinionRachel ReevesEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Why corporate takeovers of London’s tube are a terrible ideaOliver WainwrightTransport for London’s call for sponsorship of the Waterloo & City line throws out the network’s founding principles of public service and good designWed 16 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 07.21 EDTShareFew public brands have ever garnered as much unbridled popular affection as the London underground. From the moment that architectLeslie Greenunleashed his first station facades of gleaming oxblood-red terracotta tiles on to the streets of Edwardian London, the tube has offered a masterclass in the power of design to represent a truly public service.The famous roundel badge, designed by 1917 by Edward Johnston, who also created the network’s classic typeface, has become one of the most recognisable logos in history.The tube map, first drawn up by Harry Beck in 1933, is a stunning model of stripped-back clarity that has influenced transport maps the world over.The graphic moquette seat fabrics, introduced in the 1920s, are so adored that they now cover cushions, scarves and tote bags. To this day, the overall design of the Transport for London (TfL) network is an essay in legibility, consistency and coherence, enjoying a level of brand recognition that is the envy of corporations the world over. It is a visual identity that ties the entire city together, more than any urban branding exercise could ever hope to achieve.Now that cohesive design hangs in the balance. Last week, ina short LinkedIn post, TfL offered an opportunity for the “exclusive sponsorship” of the Waterloo & City line, in a deal that “goes far beyond a typical media opportunity”. The “full-line branding”, it continued, will extended “from moquette seat fabric and signage to maps and experiential spaces”, offering brands the unique chance to “own the journey” from Bank to Waterloo – a route plied daily by thousands ofthe Square Mile’shigh-net-worth decision-makers. “Ready to create standout, shareable moments on the underground?” the post asked, with a little red heart emoji.The cash-strapped tube operator is no stranger to branded takeovers. But this latest move represents by far the most complete submission to commercial sponsorship, opening the doors for private funds to creep ever further along the network, and to shrink-wrap every available surface of the commute in monetised messaging.Conservative mayor Boris Johnson was the first to begin the great sell-off, when his costly cable-car vanity project was rebranded asthe Emirates Air Linein 2012. The deal saw a private company’s name adorn the tube map for the first time, for the price of £3.6m a year. The value of this novelty soon wore off, once it became clear that few regular commuters took the ride. The current sponsor, IFS, pays just £420,000 per year for the naming rights to the mostly empty dangleway.More recently, TfL raised eyebrows last year when it plumbed the uncharted depths of immersive advertising by changing the actual names of two tube stations.The half-a-million-pound dealsaw Bond Street renamed Burberry Street, and Old Street rebranded Fold Street, to mark the launch of a Samsung phone, each for a few days. The publicity stunts were slammed at the time byTransport For All, an organisation representing passengers with disabilities, which said that “thoughtless PR stunts being used to plug holes in TfL funding cannot be at the expense of accessibility and safety for disabled passengers”.Last week’s announcement has raised similar concerns. The Greater London assembly’s Liberal Democrat leader, Hina Bokhari, described the decision as “a disgrace”. She said: “Rebranding stations may seem like a bit of harmless fun, but for neurodivergent Londoners and visitors, of whom there are many, it can cause genuine confusion and distress.”Alongside raising questions of accessibility, the latest move goes against the very essence of what makes the tube so beloved, and so successful – both as a brand, and as a shared public service in Londoners’ collective psyche. In our increasingly privatised capital, where streets are patrolled by the guards ofbusiness improvement districts, and outdoor space is often only publicly accessible at the invitation ofprivate landowners, the public transport network is one of the few lasting bastions of a civic commons. And its clear visual identity, free from wraparound vinyl decals, sponsored seat covers and “experiential” marketing installations, has been central to its success as a beloved public service.Much of the power of the tube’s identity can be credited toFrank Pick, who shaped the look of the tube network in the first half of the 20th century, and saw good design and visual clarity as a public duty. A solicitor turned publicity officer, Pick understood the power of total design, from the architecture of stations to the look of the signage, to the design of the posters promoting far-flung places that were now in reach, thanks to the miracle of the electric railways. He was the one who commissioned Johnston’s roundel and endorsed Beck’s map, as well as hiring architectCharles Holdento design a series of strikingly modern stations in the 1920s and 1930s, such asSouthgate’s art deco UFO. In Pick’s eyes, design was not just a matter of aesthetics, but an essential tool for elevating the everyday passenger experience and contributing to the overall quality of city life.“The test of the goodness of a thing,” said Pick, “is its fitness for use. If it fails on this first test, no amount of ornamentation or finish will make it any better; it will only make it more expensive, more foolish.”TfL’s attempt to flog the Waterloo & City line might plug the funding gap for a few months, but it is a foolish sticking plaster that could ultimately do more harm than good. Commuters can look forward to a future of riding the Nike Northern Line, with an air-cushioned spring in their step, or taking the Amazon Prime Piccadilly,making you take journeys you never knew you needed.Oliver Wainwright is the Guardian’s architecture and design criticExplore more on these topicsLondon UndergroundOpinionLondonDesignEnglandRail transportTransportcommentShareReuse this content"

The tale they now tell is not reassuringPolly ToynbeeYears of austerity have destroyed the web of services that tackled this complex problem. Compared to our European neighbours, we are failingWed 16 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 11.06 EDTShareIt takes the passing of time to fully grasp the scale of the previous government’s vandalism.Think where we would be now had the Tories not dismantled the social programmes they inherited from NewLabour, with so many showing rapid progress. Those watching the statistics had a jolt last week when figures from the Office for National Statistics for 2022 seemed to show the second annual rise in teenage pregnancies in England and Wales, after a decade of falling rates.This may turn out to be the result of pandemic distortions in the previous year, when numbers dropped due to teens not meeting. The next figures may return to the previous trajectory, but that’s still a sluggish rate of falling teenage conceptions and it throws into stark perspective how far Britain lags behind similar countries. The UK now has theseventh highestunder-18 live birth rate out of the 27 EU countries and us. Many of these countries’ rates are falling faster, while ours lags, largely due to our exceptionally high level of inequality. Had New Labour’s remarkable programmes around social exclusion been doing their work through these wasted Tory years, we may no longer be such a social laggard of the western world.It’s worth recounting what was lost. As soon as Labour came to power in 1997, it founded the social exclusion unit, with 18 taskforces pursuing the causes of deprivation. Truancy, bad housing, juvenile crime, debt, mental ill-health, addictions, rough sleeping, school expulsions, youth unemployment and teenage pregnancy each had a dedicated team seeking out social research. Their results were recorded each year in the index of multiple deprivation, an annual Domesday Book of the dispossessed.In 1997, halving teenage pregnancies was regarded as one of the hardest targets. That type of deeply complex social behaviour seemed beyond the reach of the state. To start with, Labour had to take on the bogus moralising among a particularly nasty cohort of Tories. The outgoing Conservative government had imposed the section 28 ban on schools discussing homosexuality and gave parents a legal right to remove children from sex education. In 1992, Peter Lilley, the minister for social security,sang a dittyabout “single mothers who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue”, while John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, castigated single mothers in Cardiff the following year as “one of the biggest social problems of our day” (“The assumptionis that the illegitimate child is a passport to a council flat,” he said). Moral blame was an excuse to cut lone parent benefits, a last-minute pre-election trap that Lilley bequeathed to the New Labour government, forcing Labour MPs to carry it out, pledged to stick to Tory spending plans.What worked was tackling all causes at once, from child poverty to school absence, alcohol use, poor sex education, a lack of access to contraception, mixed messages about sex, dismal future prospects and the impact of spending a childhood in care. Alison Hadley, who led New Labour’s teenage pregnancy taskforce, explains in her bookTeenage Pregnancy and Young Parenthoodwhy this matters: young mothers and their children tend to do badly, suffering from higher maternal depressionand higher infant mortality, with children left with a delayed verbal ability and a worse life outlook. What helped was raising the school leaving age, girls staying on until 18, going to college with an array of courses that raise aspirations and an education maintenance allowance paid to the poorest.Pastoral care at school improved, with school nurses dispensing the morning-after pill. So, too, did sex education. Alcohol use among young people fell. Youth services grew, with Connexions offering 13- to 19-year-olds everything from mental health support to careers advice. School absence rates fell as the curriculum became more flexible and fun, with a wider range of subjects and activities. Sexual health clinics for young people opened, with sessions suiting school hours. All of these were attacked by the moralisers as likely to cause an explosion of young sex. But instead, the opposite happened: the number of young people who said they had had sexual intercoursedecreased substantiallyamong boys and girls, and there were fewer conceptions.‘We’re told we won’t amount to anything’: is it possible to change the fortunes of young people living in England’s coastal towns?Read moreWhen a new government took power in 2010 and axed the programme, so many of these improving indicators went backwards.In the intervening years, teenage pregnancy rates had still been falling, though far more slowly than in comparable countries as so many key services have been lost. Brook’s special sexual health clinics for the younghave closedin places such as Wirral, Burnley, Southwark, Liverpool, Lambeth and Oldham. The Connexions youth service was abolished. Schools cut drama, sport, music, arts and technical subjects as Michael Gove’s curriculum reforms sidelined anything but his five-subject Ebaccs. In England, attendance fell and school expulsions rose, as did the off-rolling of pupils who were likely to reduce a school’s results, all reasons for Britain falling so far behind. The poorest places still have the highest rates of teenage pregnancy: there is still aseven-fold differencein rates between well-off and destitute areas.And those nasty attitudes still lurk on the Tory right among the likes of Danny Kruger, who has called for a return to “normative” family values. The former Tory MP Miriam Cates was forever attacking sex education with grotesque parodies of what was taught. She asked Rishi Sunak at prime minister’s questions if he knew about “graphic lessons on oral sex, how to choke your partner safely and 72 genders – this is what passes for relationships and sex education in British schools”, then demanded he launch an independent inquiry, whichhe duly did, a month before the last election. What did it take to address the problem? Everything.But the unit is a hopeful reminder that what was done before can be done again. Today, the education department issues bolder broader sex and relationships education guidance, a good sign, bringing schools closer toencouraging their studentsto think and talk about relationships, misogyny, pornography, bad influencers and internet threats.All of this has been recorded byMoira Wallace, a permanent secretary who became the head of the social exclusion unit from 1997 to 2002, who say she “watches like a hawk, not an ostrich” the progress or often backsliding of those programmes. Herrecent surveyon school absence shows the number of students persistently missing is rising sharply, linked to multiple bad outcomes, especially teenage pregnancy. Not everything in her social exclusion unit hit its goal, but many areas did, with action on teenage pregnancy exceeding its target, and youth employment, rough sleeping and early years metrics among other notable successes. The unit’s ambition propelled an optimism about what can be done. Lessons to be learned? Nail down improvements in the public mind, so no future government dares commit such social sabotage again.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 16 July 2025. An earlier version said that the UK had 22nd-lowest teenage pregnancy rate out of the 27 EU countries. In fact, this figure, which is the seventh highest in the EU, is for the number of live births to under-18s.Explore more on these topicsTeenage pregnancyOpinionYoung peopleLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

But success will require meaningful competition, transparency and vigilanceTue 15 Jul 2025 20.04 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 02.38 EDTShareThat extra 10c on your morning coffee. That $2 surcharge on your taxi ride. The sneaky 1.5% fee when you pay by card at your local restaurant. These could all soon be history.The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)has proposed a sweeping reform:abolishing card payment surcharges.The central bank says it’s in the public interest to scrap the system and estimates consumers could collectively save $1.2bn annually.But like all major financial reforms, the devil is in the detail.The 20-year experiment is overSurcharging was introduced more than two decades ago to expose the true cost of different payment methods. In the early 2000s, card fees were high, cash was king and surcharges helped nudge consumers towards lower-cost options.Card payment surcharges should be banned for debit and credit payments, RBA saysRead moreBut fast-forward to 2025, and the payments ecosystem has changed dramatically. Cash now accounts forjust 13%of in-person transactions, and the shift to contactless payments, accelerated by the pandemic, has made cards the default for most Australians.When there’s no real alternative, a surcharge becomes less a useful price signal and more a penalty for convenience.After an eight-month review, the bank’s Payments System Board has concluded the surcharge model no longer works in a predominantly cashless economy. The proposal now on the table is to phase out surcharges and instead push for simplified, all-inclusive pricing.Who saves – and who pays?At first glance, removing surcharges looks like a win for consumers. Every household could save about $60 per year, based on the RBA’s estimates. But payment costs don’t vanish – they shift.This is where the Reserve Bank’s proposal is more sophisticated than it may appear. Alongside banning surcharges, it plans to lower interchange fees (the fees merchants pay to card networks such as Visa and Mastercard) and introduce caps on international card transactions.These changes aim to reduce the burden on merchants, which in turn limits the pressure to raise prices.Could prices still rise?Some worry that without surcharges, businesses will simply embed the costs into product prices. That’s possible. However, the bank estimates this would result in only a 0.1 percentage point increase in consumer prices overall.There are three reasons for that:Most merchants already don’t surcharge, especially small businesses. Of them, 90% may have included card costs in their pricing.Competition keeps pricing in check. Retailers in competitive markets can’t raise prices without risking customers.Transparency is coming. The reforms will require payment providers to disclose fees more clearly, allowing merchants to compare and switch – fostering more competition and lower costs.That said, the effects won’t be felt evenly. Merchants in sectors that do currently surcharge, including hospitality, transport and tourism, will need to rethink their pricing strategies. Some may absorb costs; others may pass them on.The winnersConsumers stand to benefit most. They’ll avoid surprise fees at checkout, won’t need to switch payment methods to dodge surcharges and won’t have to report excessive fees to the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission. Combined with lower interchange fees, this means consumers should face less friction and more predictable pricing.About 90% of small businesses don’t currently surcharge and would gain around $185m in net benefits. These businesses often pay higher interchange fees, so the reform will reduce their costs. New transparency requirements will also make it easier to find better deals from payment service providers (PSPs).Large businesses already receive lower domestic interchange rates, but they’ll benefit from new caps on foreign-issued card transactions, which is a win for those in e-commerce and tourism.The losersBanks that issue cards stand to lose about $900m in interchange revenue under the preferred reform package. Some may respond by raising cardholder fees or cutting rewards, especially on premium credit cards. But they may also gain from increased credit card use as surcharges disappear.The 10% of small and 12% of large merchants who currently surcharge will have to adjust. They may face retraining costs and need to revise their pricing strategies. Most will be able to adapt, but the transition won’t be cost-free.Payment service providers will face about $25m in compliance costs to remove surcharges and provide clearer fee breakdowns. For some, this may involve significant system changes, though one-off in nature.‘Opaque and complicated’ card surcharges are costing Australians billions. Is an overhaul needed?Read moreWill it work?The Reserve Bank’s proposal tackles real problems: an outdated surcharge model, opaque pricing by payment service providers, and bundling of unrelated services into payment fees. Its success depends on how well these reforms are implemented and whether they deliver real price transparency and lower costs.Removing visible price signals may create cross-subsidisation, where users of low-cost debit cards subsidise those who use high-cost rewards credit cards. Some economists argue this could reduce overall efficiency in the system.International experience offers mixed lessons. While theEuropean UnionandUnited Kingdombanned most surcharges years ago, outcomes have varied depending on market conditions. Efficiency gains haven’t always followed, and small business concerns persist.The road aheadThe Reserve Bank is seeking feedback until26 August, with a final decision due by year-end. If adopted, the reform will be phased in, allowing time for businesses to adapt.For consumers, this may mark the end of hidden payment fees. But for the broader system, success will depend on more than just eliminating surcharges. It will require meaningful competition, transparency and vigilance during the transition.While not a major omission,mobile wallets(such as Apple Pay) and Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services represent a missing component in the broader payments ecosystem that the current reforms do not yet address.These platforms operate outside the traditional regulatory framework, often imposing higher merchant fees and lacking the transparency applied to card networks.Theirgrowing popularity, especially among younger consumers, means they increasingly shape payment behaviour and merchant cost structures. To build a truly future-ready and equitable payments system, these emerging models may need to be brought into the regulatory fold.Angel Zhong is a professor of finance at RMIT UniversityThis article was originallypublished in the ConversationExplore more on these topicsBusinessOpinionBankingConsumer affairsReserve Bank of AustraliaAustralian economycommentShareReuse this content"

Here, writers dig out their most treasured tapes and CDs full of meaning, mishaps and mega-tunesChris Wiegand,Lucy Knight,Kate Abbott,Simon Hattenstone,Alexi Duggins,Alex Needham,Keza MacDonaldandHollie RichardsonWed 16 Jul 2025 10.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 18.24 EDTShare‘I’d forgotten it ends with a secret bonus track!’At 18 my go-to albums were Dog Man Star, His ’n’ Hers and a mix tape called Really, Basically, In a Sort of a Way, Volume 1. Named after the mutterings of a particularly long-winded lecturer, it was the first of many TDK D60s – always the same brand! – from my mate Pat. We had met at our university’s registration day a few weeks earlier and would be friends for more than 20 years until his death in 2018. By then he’d not only beenon staff at the NME– teenage Pat’s dream job – but also written a book about its history.View image in fullscreen‘Bands we’d bonded over …’Photograph: courtesy of Chris WiegandSide A of the tape (entitled “Barry Manilow Live!”) has bands we’d bonded over, such as Kenickie and These Animal Men, two of our first London gigs together. Blur’sPopsceneis included because we were sweaty regulars at the club night of that name at LA2 in Charing Cross Road. The other one (“David Hasselhoff B-sides”) includes Gallon Drunk, the Byrds and Stereolab, all a bit more mature, all nudges into new directions. Everything on the inlay card is in caps and even Pat’s handwriting was cool. I hero-worshipped him well beyond our university years and he shaped my taste in films and fashion as much as music. When we were young he could be brutally, hilariously scathing about bands he despised; later, that energy would be spent more on championing than dissing. It’s years since I owned a cassette player but, looking at the tape now, I’d forgotten it ends with a “secret bonus track!” I’m guessing it’s a shared guilty pleasure (Carter USM?) and can’t wait to find out. It’ll be another joke from not just a cool and funny friend but an all-round unfaltering one.Chris Wiegand‘I still owe her a mix tape in return’Nobody had ever made me a mix tape (or a CD playlist as it would have more likely been, since I grew up in the 00s) until my 19th birthday, and even then it wasn’t a proper one. Having failed to track down a blank CD in Madrid, where we were both working as au pairs, a girl from Colorado I wasn’t exactly dating but who was definitely more than just a friend wrote me a list of songs on a page pulled out of a notepad. I remember reading it for the first time, with its loopy handwriting, doodles, and songs chosenjust for me,and thinking it was the most romantic thing in the world.View image in fullscreen‘I was confused and anxious about so many things’Photograph: courtesy of Lucy KnightLike most 19-year-olds, I was confused and anxious about so many things, but she brought so much kindness and fun into my life. We were the same age, and I can’t imagine that she had everything figured out herself, but she seemed to know more than me about most things, music included, and it was exciting to take a step into her world. I must have lost the scrap of paper at some point over the last decade, and now I can’t recall a single song that was on there. I wish I did, and I wish I had a way of contacting that girl from Colorado – I still owe her a “mix tape” in return.Lucy Knight‘This is the only version of those songs that remains’I find it easily in a bag in the attic – it has a sticker of a cat smoking a spliff, cut around the spools: a remnant of the 90s ska band Hepcat. The one mix tape I would never bin. Chris gave it to me in late 1999. He was 17 and playing gigs at venues like the Astoria. I was 16 and couldn’t go to most of the gigs at venues like the Astoria because it was a school night.It’s not what you’d call your classic heart-on-sleeve emo mix. It’s full of hardcore and punk anthems by bands such as Operation Ivy, Madball, Good Riddance and, randomly, multiple tracks by New Bomb Turks (he must have just bought their album at Tower Records in Piccadilly Circus, where he, then later we, would go on pilgrimages to find all the newest albums).View image in fullscreen‘He wanted me to hear his own band’Photograph: courtesy of Kate AbbottThere are also, seemingly, no songs on side B. I re-listen to the tape now on my grandpa’s old cassette deck, and have to endure almost 45 minutes of static to get back to the start – I simply cannot risk pressing fast forward in case the whole precious thing gets chewed up. Then, all of a sudden, the radio-recorded dolphin tones of Mariah Carey emerge from the static singing Heartbreaker, a track he knew I loved more than any punk, then cuts off before Jay-Z’s verse. Worth the 43 minutes of white noise, truly.But the start of side A, the pièce de résistance – and surely the real reason he wanted me to have the tape – was so I could hear his own band. Two tunes, recorded live with laughably terrible sound levels but faultless drumming by Chris. Two tunes my teenage self listened to over and over.Twenty-five years on, this is the only version of those songs that remains. I absolutely love that they are unShazamable, that they exist solely on this crinkly tape that is one listen away from ruination. I still love those tunes – just as I love his new band. Our two children do, too.Kate Abbott‘This one’s for you, Mum’We didn’t call them mix tapes back in the day. Well, I didn’t. Wasn’t cool enough. They were just tapes with songs on. The first life-changing one was sent to me by a friend Steve and it was just the most brilliant mix of all the punk songs I didn’t know – the Damned, the Buzzcocks, the Ramones, the Pistols, of course, and best of all the Vibrators with Baby Baby. It was – and is – amazing. Lush, romantic, as much full of yearning as feedback, and super loud. Imagine Phil Spector turned punk and you’ve got Baby Baby.It didn’t make me a punk (still too uncool), but it did make me want to dye my hair black (pointless, as it already was), spike it up with sugar, and stick a red arrow through my ear. Which I did a bit later.View image in fullscreenWannabe punk …Photograph: courtesy of Simon HattenstoneThe last mix tape I made, in December 2023, was very much a modern mix tape. Improvised on the night, and on YouTube. Mum was dying and I spent the night by her bedside with my laptop. I just played song after song that I loved for her, unsure whether she could hear. I introduced them, like a DJ. “And this is Tom Waits’s version of Somewhere for you Marje because it’s exceptionally beautiful and I love you.” “And here’s a little number from Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville Don’t Know Much,which makes me cry and think of you because I love you.” “And here’s Leonard Cohen at his most melodic singing Dance Me to the End of Love, and I’ve chosen this because, erm, I love you.” “Now for something a little different, Late for the Sky by Jackson Browne, which I’ve chosen for you because I love you, even if its meaning is a bit more complicated.” The songs kept coming through the night and I played them really loud. “And of course the night would be incomplete without Stevie Wonder’s As. This one’s for you Mum because yes, you’ve guessed it, I love you.”Each one was a love song and in their own way about immortality. I didn’t know it at the time. And I didn’t know what was coming next. I was just somehow reaching for the right songs, in a state almost as altered as Mum’s. I like to think she heard them. But even if she didn’t, she knew how much I loved her. She died early the next morning.Simon Hattenstone‘My sister created the world’s worst Idlewild remix tape’Back in the late 90s, whenever melodic noise-rockers Idlewild would tour, my sister and I would go. We had spent hours engaged in classic sibling bonding: listening to guitar squall while I prevented the mosh pit from stamping on my little sister’s head. Yes, her taste often tended more towards the likes of Steps, but for some reason we both loved this band’s scuzzy pop, and one day, she made me a tape of one of their live gigs.I was extremely excited. I saved it for a long bus journey, popped it into my Walkman, fired it up and sunk into angular, dissonance-strewn indie. It was absolute joy. There were new songs! Ferociously taut renditions of the classics! And … the random intrusion ofKiss Me by Sixpence None the Richer.View image in fullscreen‘It’s a testament to her glorious daftness’Photograph: courtesy of Alexi DugginsConfusion reigned as I suddenly found myself listening to a Christian rock troupe’s schmaltzy ode to smooching – until it abruptly segued back to the gig. And then back to Kiss Me. And then back to the gig. Five minutes later, a blisteringly distorted riff mutated into an advert for a local car dealership. At which point I realised something: my sister had decided to check out a poppier radio station halfway through recording – and inadvertently created the world’s worst Idlewild remix tape.My sister has since died. I’ll never be able to drag her out of a mosh pit again, or hear her attempt at a silly impression of the vocal tics of Idlewild frontman Roddy Woomble. But I’ll always have that tape. It might have been intended as a killer Idlewild live recording, but it’s ended up something much more precious: a testament to her glorious daftness. Best mix tape ever.Alexi Duggins‘We had our ups and downs, to put it mildly, but I’m glad I have this memento’I was given this mix tape in early 2004, at the outset of a relationship that lasted for almost a decade. It lives on a shelf in my living room with a few other cassettes, displayed for aesthetic reasons, since I no longer have a tape deck to play them on. Looking at it now, it seems like a vivid portrait of my ex and his then passions, from the picture of James Dean rolling his eyes on the handmade cover to the scratchy and abrasive music on the tape itself, from Her Jazz by Huggy Bear to Gutless by Hole, deep cuts like Other Animals are #1 by Erase Errata alongside classics like Patti Smith’s Redondo Beach.View image in fullscreen‘A memento of our early tenderness’Photograph: courtesy of Alex NeedhamMore than half the tracks are by female or female-fronted acts; my ex was brought up by his mum and most of his friends were women. He once told me that men had been responsible for all the negative experiences in his life (I suspect that our relationship has now been added to this list). Looking at the track listing I’m reminded of his great taste, noting the appearance of Maps by Yeah Yeah Yeahs, then pretty recent but now a romantic classic.We had our ups and downs, to put it mildly, but I’m glad I have this memento of our early tenderness and intimacy.Alex Needham‘That mix CD was how I discovered Finnish metal!’I am very slightly too young for the golden era of mix tapes – open my first Walkman and you would have only found storybooks on tape – but I amexactlythe right age to be part of the micro-generation of teens that burned CDs (or MiniDiscs) of stolen MP3s from LimeWire for our friends and crushes.There were two enormous problems with this method of sharing songs: one, the file compression made everything sound unlistenably terrible, and two, what youthoughtyou were illegally downloading from LimeWire was very oftennotwhat you were actually downloading from LimeWire. I discovered this when my best friend made me a mix of what she thought were songs by my favourite German metal band, Rammstein. In fact it was a CD full of entirely random European songs that someone on LimeWire had egregiously mislabeled, including a Dutch version of Aqua’s Barbie Girl, all with that spangly sound that was unique to low-quality MP3 mixes of the era.We laughed about this for years, but fun fact, that mix CD was how I discovered Finnish metal (and Megaherz, the most early-00s German metal band to exist).Keza MacDonald‘I could not handle feeling that way about someone’The Beatles’I Want to Hold Your Hand. Weezer’sHoliday. The Cribs’The Lights Went Out. These are some of the songs that my first boyfriend chose to burn on to a CD for me. It was summer 2006. I had found my true tribe outside of school, most nights (and early mornings) were spent in fields, my last year of sixth form was nigh and I had finally fallen in love. I fell hard. I could not believe – or handle! – feeling that way about somebody.Music was starting to properly soundtrack my life for the first time: club nights and indie gigs, soaking up the albums my new mates played and making plans for Leeds Festival. My ex opened my world to some great music I wouldn’t know without him. I thought that CD was so cool and romantic. (“He wants to holdmyhand!”)The short version of this tragic love story: the relationship soured and it ended by winter. It would take me at least a couple of years to get over it.At some point, I threw the CD in the bin along with everything else he had given me – too young, inexperienced and cried out to know I might quite want to see these items again one day. But every time I hear those songs play – and I do regularly seek them out – I’m comforted by a rose-tinted wave of nostalgia. They take me back to a time when life was just really starting – way more highs and heartbreak ahead. I’m glad I’ll always have the music to take with me.Hollie RichardsonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Everything about it is energising, masculine, powerful’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 16 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareI’m not a cowboy and I don’t ride horses, but I’ve been around them my whole life. My dad had a furniture store near the stockyards in south Omaha, and I would watch the cattle being moved between pens ready to go to auction. I sensed a freedom in the cowboys that I related to. I’ve always been an explorer, it’s my nature. I’m more comfortable and I feel most alive in situations I’m not familiar with. I am always drawn to this same type – I’ve photographed test pilots and astronauts – the strong, quiet, self-directed types who seem to be in control of their destiny.This shot of Mark, a friend of mine, was taken in 2014. All my images are productions, I don’t just happen to be there. I build a narrative and visit locations – it’s more like making a movie, it’s very intentional. I scout locations that connect to what I want to represent. This was a rugged area of northern Colorado. The shoot was really about speed and energy, and I wanted open spaces that could allow the cowboys to do what they wanted. I wanted harder surfaces and dramatic skies – although you never really know what you’re going to get. I take references from historical paintings and drawings of the American west, and ideas I carry on pieces of paper, so I go with a visual feel of what I want to do. I wanted to separate the colours of the landscape: the colour of the hat, the horse, its saddle blanket, were all selected deliberately. The image is all about power and grace – the gesture of the animal is so forceful, and the cowboy is so in control.I looked up Ansel Adams in the phone book and called him. And that was the start of me studying with Ansel AdamsWhen I look at this photograph I want to be that guy. He’s super alive and in the moment, there’s the feeling of an adrenaline rush – everything about it is energising, masculine, powerful – and it underlines the theme of freedom. It gives you a feeling of life. When I look back, a lot of my work is about the same thing. It’s not so much about cowboys, it’s about the freedom to express yourself. I hope it makes people feel good – it makes me feel empowered. The cowboy, like the Statue of Liberty or the Hollywood sign, is a symbol of America, it conveys some kind of hope, something aspirational.Giddy up! Photos from the wild frontier – in picturesRead moreWhen Richard Prince appropriated my work in 2007, it was a real catalyst to redefine myself. In the last 10 years, that’s given me the freedom to express what I think about the American west in new ways, such as in my paintings. I don’t have an agenda, I am always on the move physically and conceptually with my work. It was violating to have my image taken – but it did bring my work to light. It was afterthe New York Times articlethatJames Danzingerbegan to represent me.I used to watch my maternal grandfather paint every Saturday. He was an abstract expressionist and his use of colour was very unusual. After he had a stroke, Saturdays with him ended but he gave me my first camera and instructed me to use it. One day he told me he had been reading about someone he thought I should study with –Ansel Adams. I looked him up in the phone book and called – and that was the start of me studying and working with Adams in California.Nowadays, people don’t look that much at what’s around them. It’s a very angst-ridden environment, it’s hard to separate ourselves from the emotional rollercoaster. I don’t bury my head in the sand but my work is a way for me to escape. It’s the only way I can get away from all this shit that’s going on on a daily basis, and make something beautiful that inspires me. If you keep your eyes open, there’s just so much out there.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Jim KrantzJim Krantz’s CVBorn:Omaha, Nebraska, 1955Trained:“I am still in training, and plan to continue.”Influences:“The natural world and my maternal grandfather.”High point:“Mt Wilson, near Telluride at 13,800ft – photographing for the US army. The high points in a career often get the most attention, but it’s the low points that have taught me the most.

It’s from those uncertain places that you rebuild – and that’s where the real expansion and improvement happen.

Its tales of bookseller-cum-semi-Sherlock are a TV joyLucy ManganWed 16 Jul 2025 16.10 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 19.11 EDTShareYou may feel that your cosy crime dance card is full. You’ve done all the Richard Osmans, polished off Ludwig and that new Timothy Spall one, Death Valley, not as bleak as it sounds, and of course there’s Father Brown to fall back on when you are ill and Agatha Raisin when you need cheering up. You’re good.But … as with a delicious box of chocolates, which is to say any box of chocolates, there’s always room for one more, isn’t there? And here it is, your next flavoursome nugget of absolute delight – Bookish. This six-part detective drama was created byMark Gatiss, written by Matthew Sweet and stars the former as Gabriel Book, a secondhand bookseller in postwar London. He carries a mysterious “letter from Churchill” as a result of his equally mysterious service in the war and this allows him to lend a hand with any passing police investigation that catches his eye. Think of him as a legitimised semi-Sherlock if you wish.In the opening double bill, Slightly Foxed – the perfect and inevitable pun under the circumstances – the eye-catching investigation involves a plague pit uncovered at a bombsite, the apparent suicide of a local chemist via prussic acid and a lavish strewing of clues (at least one of which Book finds almost too obvious, which makes it another kind of clue altogether) and complications (missing morphine, a bloodied head but no broken skin, on top of a poisoning? Rum, old boy, altogether rum). Possible suspects include the pharmacist’s semi-estranged daughter and her spiv boyfriend, the erstwhile ARP warden, Rosie Cavaliero’s char lady (called Mrs Dredge to give us some Dickensian undertones to enjoy) and there are red herrings (and jade figurines) and period detail along the way.Mix Tape review – nails the heart-stopping excitement of new loveRead moreThe latter ranges from the pleasingly traditional (whistleblowing bobbies, meat as a luxury item, the prevalence of powdered egg), through to the still more pleasingly niche (Georgette Heyer fandom and Book’s refusal to indulge it) and on to the more difficult aspects of life in 1946 England: orphaned children making the best of new circumstances, the sweeping away of old certainties as the shellshocked population waits to see if something better or worse will rise from the rubble, the pride and sorrow attached to war heroes and those who had to care for the injured ones when they came home. Bookish delivers a ripping yarn, yes, but grief and melancholy undercut it at many turns.Alongside the self-contained plot, we have the slower burn of what precisely is going on in Book’s life. He is married to Trottie (Polly Walker) and they clearly love each other dearly but sleep apart. They have recruited a young man to help in the shop while Gabriel sleuths. Jack (Connor Finch) is an orphan with no memories of his mother and only a single picture of his father, fresh out of a two-year stint in prison for his part as the getaway driver in a smash-and-grab raid in Mayfair. There are signs that the Books have taken him under their wing for motives other than altruism. There are also (God, Walker remains such a magnificent danger) signs that Mrs Book may have a taste for younger men which, if they come to fruition, will require a subcategory of cosy crime to be hastily instituted so we’ll need to keep an eye on that.I don’t think it counts as a spoiler to say that one gently unspooling thread of Bookish is an exploration of Book’s life as a necessarily closeted gay man. It adds to the sense of sorrow that infuses the series and gives it heft, and warms the edges of Book as a character and of Gatiss – customarily quite a closed and chilly actor – to a valuable degree.There are a few tricky moments – I’m not sure I buy an opportunistic theft by a man who just happens to be carrying around a jade chess set, or why he would leave a piece behind as an entirely unconvincing substitute for a stolen figurine. I feel, too, that we could do with finding some way other than battles about apostrophe placement to demonstrate a character’s intellectual superiority. But overall Bookish is a fine piece of entertainment – meticulously worked, beautifully paced and decidedly moreish. (It was commissioned for a second series before the first began.) It has enough spikiness to stop it being formulaic but enough love for the genre to keep it comforting.

There will be children, some of whom will be dead, others merely telekinetic and/or screaming in pyjamas. There will be blood. And flannel shirts.And dialogue so awful you will want to bludgeon it with a spade and inter it in an ancient burial ground, despite the suspicion that it will rise from the dead and continue to torment you.Like the generally superior film versions of the author’s works, some of these TV adaptations will, in fact, be very enjoyable. Others will not. And then there is The Institute (MGM+), a new adaptation ofa middling 2019 thrillerthat manages to capture the endearingly wonky essence of King’s genius by being both extremely well crafted and, at times, astonishingly silly. But how does it measure up to its predecessors?Let us clamber into a flannel shirt and, screaming pre-emptively, explore the best and worst of small-screenStephen King.The worstThe Shining (1997)View image in fullscreenBad fashion, bad acting … Steven Weber in King’s own small-screen adaptation of The Shining.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyEnraged byStanley Kubrick’s magnificent interpretation of his 1977 novel (too little substance, apparently),King respondedwith a “definitive”adaptation of his own. Cue this two-part abomination, in which writer Jack Torrance (Steven Weber) terrorises his family with his definitive denim blouson and definitive inability to act. Further definitives: CGI topiary, a young Danny Torrance seemingly incapable of speaking without snuffling (sinusitis?) and a final showdown consisting of a mallet-wielding Jack chasing his nasal son past the same endlessly looped stretch of hotel corridor.Under the Dome (2013-2015)View image in fullscreenAliens above … living Under the Dome.Photograph: Brownie Harris/CBSA thunderously bovine fusion of small-town soap and big-budget sci-fi that includes plucky teens, military machinations, a soundtrack packed with SUDDEN and UNNECESSARY NOISES and a bit where a pensioner in dungarees shouts, “OHHHH SHIIIIIIT” at half a sliced-in-two CGI cow. Stuffed from the word go, frankly, due to a premise so risible (alien egg makes indestructible transparent dome descend on town) you wouldn’t be surprised if the remaining half of the sliced-in-two CGI cow turned to camera and begged to be put out of its misery.Storm of the Century (1999)View image in fullscreenTedious terrible weather watching … the 1999 show of Storm of the Century.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyA tiny Maine island is besieged by exposition when a stranger in a small hat arrives during a blizzard. The upshot? Tedium. Plus? Levitating guns, CGI snow and hundreds of minor characters, one of whom will, every half hour or so, extend their neck out of the gloom to announce a terrible new subplot before telescoping it back in again while everyone else nods and says, “yuh”.

In this instance, the threat is twofold. Namely 1) a viral apocalypse and 2) a script that takes King’s outstanding 1978 fantasy by its ankles and shakes it until its brain falls out. Makes even the 1994 adaptation (Gary Sinise shouting “Noooo” at a field for six hours) look tolerable by dint of bewildering flashbacks, zero tension, general confusion, Whoopi Goldberg and wolves.The Langoliers (1995)View image in fullscreenVolcanically dull … The Langoliers.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamySome people disappear from a plane, some other people argue about it, one of these people gets eaten by angry space meatballs, the end. A terrible reminder that the worst King has always been sci-fi King, this three-hour duffer has more in common with the appalling “shouting ensemble” disaster films of the 70s than anything “one” might wish to watch with one’s “TV dinner”. The result? A miniseries so volcanically dull you had to prick your telly with a fork, like a baked potato, to let the yawns out.The bestThe Institute (2025)View image in fullscreenSaving the world? … Joe Freeman in The Institute.Photograph: Chris Reardon/MGM+A tyrannical bootcamp for telekinetic children, you say? With a small-town backdrop, federal bastardry and eccentrics in plaid prophesying on porches? Why, ’tis season four of Stranger Things! Except it isn’t. Welcome, instead, to a very solemn eight-part thriller, in which awful things happen slowly to good actors (not leastJoe Freeman, son of Martin Freeman and Amanda Abbington) and YA friendships bloom despite the presence of lines of the “you are about to participate in saving the world!” variety.

And so it proved with this confounding oddity, a sci-fi potboiler that cartwheels into the “actually hugely watchable” category by virtue of everything from acting to special effects being coated in an almost certainly accidental layer of camp.

Further proof that when it comes to miniseries, it pays to employ a proper director (Tobe “Poltergeist” Hooper, in this instance) as opposed to, say, an upturned bucket in a turtleneck.It (1990)View image in fullscreenClowning around … It.Photograph: Warner Bros Television/AlamyKing’s 1,100-page masterpiece becomes a wildly memorable miniseries, with the obligatory horrible bits (bloodied plugholes, whispering plugholes, murderous transdimensional entities bursting out of plugholes, etc) accompanied by a smart pace and rare emotional investment in the fate of its trembling young protagonists. And then there is, of course, Tim Curry as Pennywise the Clown; a performance of such grotesque enormousness it threatens to explode out of the screen.The Outsider (2020)View image in fullscreenWho’s the killer? … The Outsider.Photograph: HBO/SkyHBO steeples its fingers over King’s 2018 midweight mystery and proceeds to say, “Hmm” slowly … across 10 episodes … of glacially paced … child murder and …Detective Ben Mendelsohn’s … investigative … jeans. And yet. The direction is excellent, the themes (buried grief! The nature of faith!) are explored thoughtfully rather than pounded feverishly with hammers and everything is marinated in that woozy greige lighting that indicates we are in the presence of Proper Acting and are thus unlikely to encounter, say, a pensioner in dungarees shouting, “OHHHH SHIIIIIIT” at half a sliced-in-two CGI cow.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionStephen KingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is a shaggy dog tale of ineffable silliness, operating ostensibly on the realist lines of indie US cinema but sauntering sideways from its initial premise, getting further and further from what had appeared to be a real issue: how difficult it is for grown men to make new friends.In this case, a beta-male chump attempts to be mates with his supercool new neighbour and you might even suspect that the film’s progressive excursion into stoner unseriousness itself enacts men’s avoidant nature, their inability to find an emotionally intelligent connection with each other. The result is not unlike the darkly wacky entertainments ofJim HoskingorTodd Solondz; there’s also a tiny hint ofCharlie Kaufmanand the white-collar-workplace losers of Ricky Gervais and Steve Carell.‘A case study on psychosis’: men on why Tim Robinson’s Friendship feels a little too realRead moreIn a bland suburban close, Craig (Robinson) is a dull but well-meaning guy working in corporate PR consultancy, whose elegant wife Tami (Kate Mara) runs a flower delivery business from the house. She is in remission from cancer, and Craig has patently no clue how to deal with this. At a support group for people with cancer and their partners, Craig beamingly assures her in front of everyone present that there’s no way the cancer is coming back, in a wince-makingly misjudged attempt at emotional strength. Now Tami is openly reconnecting with an old flame, in the face of which Craig is as uncomprehending and unjudging as the family dog.It is at this moment that Craig runs into Austin (Paul Rudd), the stylish guy who lives next door; he is a minor celebrity, plays in a local band and is a weatherman on the regional TV news. (This is in slight contrast to his character in Anchorman, field reporter Brian Fantana; Steve Carell’s Brick was the weatherman.) Craig is stunned by Austin’s worldly sophistication and laid-back charm, and Austin is touched by Craig’s heartbreaking vulnerability; he welcomes Craig into his circle of male friends for a “hang”. Over-excited Craig embarrassingly goes too far and annoys Austin, but discovers a secret that means that Austin can never entirely break up with him as a friend.Until Craig’s terrible faux pas with Austin, which he (horrifyingly) attempts to style out by literally eating soap and goofily intoning “sorry”, it’s possible to read Friendship as a plausible, if far-detached character study, a cringe-comedy Single White Male heading for disaster. Then it swerves away, following its nose towards something weirder, with an amusing setpiece featuring Craig licking a toad in search of psychedelic thrills and experiencing only a minute-long hallucination of outrageous banality. For some, that will be tiresome; and it’s certainly the case that the female characters are under-imagined (Austin’s wife hardly exists at all). But male inadequacy is the point; the loopy absurdism grows on you.Friendship is in UK and Irish cinemas from 18 July, and Australian cinemas from 17 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter Bradshaw's film of the weekComedy filmsPaul RuddKate MaraMen (Society)Men (Life and style)ComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Reader, she has now put that phase behind her. I Am a Strange Gloop finds our host staggering shell-shocked from the soft play area to the stage, with battle-hardened tales to tell from motherhood’s frontline. Ruthlessly banished from the centre of her own life, she now endures an existence “that makes The Handmaid’s Tale look progressive”, cleaning up after infant sons, fielding their erratic poos, playing receptacle and canvas for vomit and passing toilet brushes.All that is amusing if familiar. So, too, her material on her manchild husband, which – coming from an act who once laid siege to gender essentialism – cleaves surprisingly to stereotype. Where our host gets sharper is in the philosophical dimension she gives this new chapter of life, conjuring with a sense of self so undermined by becoming a mum, and by shouldering adult responsibilities, that she’s not sure what’s left of prior-Pascoe – see one terrific joke about escaping, like her two kids did before her, from her own body.Sara Pascoe: ‘I still identify as an infertile, childless woman’Read moreThere are other ways to cheat biology, of course: the show’s second recurring subject is the transhumanist fantasy of remaining forever young. There’s also a counterintuitive section on AI porn, and a story about meetingRobbie Williamsthat brings middle-aged Sara into contact with the teenage Take That fan she used to be.This may not add up to as tight or conceptually rich a show as the 44-year-old has delivered in years gone by. Her closing set-piece, a new chapter she’s written to add to the Bible, is apropos of nothing that precedes it. But she delivers some fine material – about Sisyphus, revolting against capitalism, and an excellent running joke (in more ways than one) aboutPaula Radcliffe– even if doesn’t unite into a coherent whole. Forever young? That’s not happening. Forever interesting?

As Nintendo’s first major single-player Switch 2 game, it will set the quality bar for the console in the way Breath of the Wild did when the original Switch was released. But as the latest game from the team responsible for the exceptional 3D Mario series, it is already begrudged by someNintendofans as a distraction: what could possibly be so exciting about a tie-wearing gorilla to justify making Bananza ahead of another Super Mario Odyssey?Donkey Kong demolishes those concerns. He demolishes a lot in Bananza. It may resemble a Mario 64-style 3D platformer on the surface, with its themed worlds festooned with giant bananas to sniff out and collect, but DK’s fists show total disregard for the playground as built. All terrain is destructible. Mash the buttons and his powerful arms thump tunnels through hills, pound pristine lawns into muddy craters and tear up wodges of stone to swing as sledgehammers for even speedier landscaping. He is less a platforming mascot than a potassium-powered level editor.View image in fullscreenRepeatable joy … Donkey Kong Bananza.Photograph: NintendoOn a primal level, that’s almost enough to hold your attention. There’s an easy, repeatable joy in throwing a punch this well programmed: the jolt of pause as knuckles collide with rock, the snarl of Joy-Con 2 rumble, the way surfaces splinter before another hit brings down the entire wall. I can see Bananza having a second life as an executive stress reliever; a virtual rage room where you heave exploding boulders at cliffs to reduce them to pockmarked swiss cheese. You can even invite a co-op pal along to shoot projectiles from DK’s back and accelerate the chaos (or act as a devilish tag along to a player trying to avoid any carnage).There is motivation behind the mayhem. The existing Kong clan (getting some choice cameos that channel the comic spirit of Rare’s Donkey Kong Country games) is expanded by villainous mining Kongs set on snagging a treasure at the planet’s core. En route they kidnap Pauline, the young singer whom Donkey Kong originally snatched in his arcade debut. But Kong and Pauline are on better terms here: she coaxes animal superpowers by belting out powerful earworms straight into his skull. If my plot recollection seems hazy, it’s only because it’s been supplanted in my mind by her Latin pop ditty about the joy of being a zebra.View image in fullscreenA  strange world … Donkey Kong Bananza.Photograph: NintendoThis is a strange world but an even stranger platforming proposition. How do you design obstacles for a hero who can tunnel under laser fences or jackhammer doorways through barriers that would have stopped Mario in his tracks? Truthfully, it takes a beat to find the answers. There is an initial mushiness to worlds that can be excavated from any angle. Sometimes you blindly mine into rewards intended for challenges you have not yet uncovered or parsed, and the haphazardness of these unearned prizes has you wondering, for a second, if the game’s freeform audacity rings as hollow as the caves you’re punching into existence.But no. Later, rolling plains and jaunty lagoons make way for more dangerous landscapes, where solid ground protects you from poison swamps, icy lakes and lava. Down here, land is life, so your treatment of it becomes more deliberate, your strikes more surgical. When metal caterpillars gobble a wooden life raft or a pogoing menace punches through a platform you tenderised into a thin sliver, you suddenly appreciate the method in Nintendo’s morphable madness. Boss fights make exceptional use of fragile terrain, keeping DK from walloping chunks from their giant bodies by rendering arenas more and more uneven as fights unfold.The only fumble in these later stages is the overpowered nature of the Bananzas themselves. These animal transformations imbue DK with speed, flight, strength and more, and when contained in the challenges or levels built for them they sing. You are reminded of Mario’s Odyssey possessions and how perfectly realised each of those physical sensations was. But taken out of that context – when returning to earlier stages to mop up collectibles, for example – they become instant win buttons, dulling the ingenuity of Nintendo’s platforming designs.I’m not sure Bananza has the same legs as Mario Odyssey. Where that game blossomed in a rich, post-credit endgame, DK lives more in the moment: moving ever forward, chewing through new ideas and never stopping to pulverise the roses. Come the game’s epic climax, he has smashed through concrete, rubber, watermelon, ostrich eggs, entire Donkey Kong Country homages, glitter balls – even the NPCs he’s trying to protect. If the weight of Switch 2 does lie on his shoulders, that’s just one more tool to bash a hole in the universe. His appetite for destruction is infectious.Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendoNintendo Switch 2Platform gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’m aiming to keep his incredible legacy alive at this year’s PromsNicholas McCarthyWed 16 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Jul 2025 12.26 EDTShareIlove talking to people about piano music written for the left hand. It’s a corner of the repertoire that’s often seen as a mysterious niche – yet it comprises a handful of hidden gems for solo piano and a few celebrated concertos too.With most people, the conversation quickly turns to Ravel’s legendary Piano Concerto for the Left Hand (1929-30). This masterwork, a favourite among pianists, has been performed by some of the world’s greatest keyboard titans and – as a pianist born without my right hand – holds a special place in my own output. But there are a great deal more pieces for the left hand out there.The story begins in the early 19th century when concert pianists were cultural superstars. Liszt, for instance, packed out European concert halls in the same way that a modern day icon such as Taylor Swift sells out stadiums in minutes. These virtuosos enthralled their audiences with their technical brilliance and dramatic showmanship. And they often added an encore designed to astonish – such as performing dazzling feats of pyrotechnics using only their left hand. Using the so-called “weaker” hand to deliver a bravura display was irresistible to concertgoers, and the spectacle would leave them in awe.The trick lay in the aural illusion: left-hand works often create the impression of two or even three hands playing simultaneously, deceiving even the savviest listeners. Though the left hand tends to be weaker, its physiology gives it an advantage. In standard two-handed piano repertoire the melody line is mostly projected in the right hand by the little finger, the weakest of the fingers. But in left-hand repertoire the melody line is projected by the thumb, the strongest digit, giving it greater clarity. This is why there are more than 3,000 works for left hand alone, yet only a few for the right hand. Another important element in the left-hand pianist’s toolkit is the sustain pedal. This allows bass notes to remain present in the texture creating a fuller sound, similar to that which two hands can achieve.View image in fullscreenPioneering … Paul Wittgenstein in New York in 1934 ahead of a concert tour of the US.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveThe development of serious left-hand repertoire beyond encore and novelty pieces, give or take a few real left-hand gems, did not occur until the 20th century, in the aftermath of the first world war. At the centre of this evolution was Paul Wittgenstein (1887-1961) whose story would for ever alter the course of left-hand-alone music.A member of the prominent Viennese Wittgenstein family, Paul was the son of a wealthy steel magnate and the brother of renowned philosopher Ludwig. The family was deeply embedded in European high society, with close connections to some of the greatest names in art, music and culture. Paul was a gifted pianist who made his concert debut in 1913. But the outbreak of war would soon change his life for ever.Having enlisted in the Austro-Hungarian army, Wittgenstein was seriously injured fighting the Russian army in the Battle of Galicia, losing his right arm. This was tragically a common wartime injury: right-handed soldiers often suffered damage to their dominant limb during combat. Taken prisoner after the battle, Wittgenstein was moved to a Siberian camp. Here he etched out the lines of a piano keyboard in charcoal on the base of an upturned wooden crate, spending several hours a day hammering the phantom keys with his remaining hand. A visiting dignitary, witnessing this poignant and unusual sight, arranged for him to be transferred to a camp where there was an upright piano. Wittgenstein set to work figuring out how to play the pieces he adored – but with his left hand alone.Repatriated to Vienna in 1915, Wittgenstein faced the monumental challenge of reinventing himself as a one-handed pianist. With steely determination (and his family’s immense wealth and elite connections), he set out to build a career. He commissioned some of the most celebrated composers of the era to write works for him. These included concertos by Prokofiev, Strauss, Britten, Korngold and Hindemith. Wittgenstein did not perform every piece he commissioned. He told Prokofiev that he did not understand his4th Piano Concerto: “The inner logic of the work is not clear to me, and, of course I can’t play it until it is.” He quarrelled with other composers over changes he demanded to their scores.Among the works he commissioned was Ravel’s aforementioned Piano Concerto for the Left Hand. Yet even that iconic work was not scandal-free: Wittgenstein made changes to the score for the premiere.Ravel was incensed, and the pair only reconciled after Wittgenstein agreed to perform it as originally written.The concerto is a triumph of ingenuity and artistry. Though it was composed at around the same time asRavel’s other Piano Concerto, for two hands, the works are poles apart – each a unique testament to the composer’s mastery of orchestration and piano writing. I vividly remember hearing it for the first time as a 15-year-old. Its opening captivated me immediately: an ominous visceral rumble from the orchestra that gradually unfolds into a majestic theme, rising through the low growl of the instruments. All the while the pianist sits in suspense waiting for their dramatic entrance. The attention is electric, and ice-cold nerves are required from the soloist as they prepare for their moment of brilliance.View image in fullscreen‘Specialising in this extraordinary repertoire is a privilege, a responsibility and, at times, a real challenge.’ Nicholas McCarthy.Photograph: Bernardo Arcos Mijailidis/Archivo: Arcos-AlcarazThroughout his life Ravel was inspired by the play of water. Jeux d’eau (Water Games, 1901), and Ondine (the water nymph) from Gaspard de la Nuit (1908) convey this beautifully. Yet, for me, his most water-like musical achievement comes in the left-hand concerto’s breathtaking extended cadenza, heard towards the end of the work. Here the piano becomes a shimmering cascade, rippling and flowing with crystalline beauty before building to a powerful conclusion.Specialising in this extraordinary repertoire is a privilege, a responsibility and, at times, a real challenge. If my forthcomingPromsperformance of the Ravel whets your appetite to hear more, I recommend the Britten Diversions for Piano Left Hand and Orchestra as well as Martinu’s Concertino (Divertimento), a lovely little gem of a work for chamber orchestra and piano left hand. And I confess I can’t agree with Wittgenstein about the work’s inner logic – I’ll be performing Prokofiev’s 4th Piano Concerto next year, and will also soon be adding Korngold’s glorious Piano Concerto for Left Hand to my repertoire.There are still preconceptions around disability and a career in music. As one of just a few classical soloists with a physical disability, I’ve had to be patient and resilient and to develop a thicker skin simply because I don’t fit into the correct box. But I hope I can inspire the next generation of pianists to explore this remarkable music. Just as Wittgenstein blazed a trail for me, I aspire to light the way for others, ensuring that the legacy of left-hand-alone music continues to thrive.Nicholas McCarthy performs Ravel’s Piano Concerto for the Left Hand at theProms on 20 July.

You don’t need a language for this. It’s accessible in many ways.“Sometimes it gets exhausting reading all of the texts of all the artworks that you find interesting. But in an immersive setting, you literally come and sit in some art.”George the Poet chose Reflections on the Thames by John Atkinson Grimshaw, the enduring image of the moonlit river that runs through the centre of London.Alongside the immersive artwork that will be projected on to the walls, ceiling and floor of the space, are spoken-word pieces about the paintings, which were developed during workshops.The poet, who has worked with offenders in prison, believes art can broaden horizons.He said: “A lot of the conflict that I saw growing up was exacerbated by the feeling of not being able to leave the community, not being able to see beyond our immediate environment. One way to combat that is to invite new experiences.”View image in fullscreenThe Great Wave by Hokusai reimaged for Art of Expression at Frameless, the UK’s largest immersive art experience.Photograph: David Parry/ShutterstockA new piece of research was commissioned as part of the project, which surveyed 2,000 young people, asking them about their views on art and accessibility.It found that almost two-thirds of young people want more access to art, while a quarter said that art galleries “can be intimidating”.Nearly half said that historical art is not relevant to their modern lives, and when asked if they considered a career in the arts, 40% stated they did “not know where to start”.Tafari Clarke, a member of the Young People’s Action Group at the violence reduction unit, said: “Being an artist isn’t really glamorised like being a lawyer or being a footballer.

The future is our young people.

It’s a place exposed to “the raw death of the endless future, which at night in the midwest in winter is sometimes bare inches above the roofs”. Just as frightening is Nicholas’s sense that “anything can come in”. One day in January, what comes into Nicholas is the god Pan – a possessing, deranging, life-threatening spirit. Or that, anyhow, is how Nicholas comes to interpret his increasingly disabling anxiety.Pan is remarkable for the honesty of its treatment of both mental illness and adolescence. It shows more successfully than any other book I’ve read how these can be experienced as black magic – indeed, it allows that they might be black magic. Nicholas successfully prophesies trivial events (the wind rising, someone saying the word “diabetes”) and is haunted by a dead mouse’s squeak. Another boy finds a means of divination in a schlock fantasy novel. Even the pop anthem More Than a Feeling is a path to the uncanny; it’s a song with “a door in the middle of it … like the door on a UFO”. Nicholas becomes convinced that he is perpetually at risk of leaving his body – specifically, that his “looking/thinking could pour or leap out” of his head – and his friends, also being 15 years old, are ready to believe it, too. They are easy prey for Ian, a college-age man who sets himself up as a small-time cult leader among these high-school kids. Ian particularly targets Nicholas, telling him that only they are capable of real thoughts; the others in the group are “Hollows” who have “Solid Mind”, a deterministic mentality with no animating self. “The sound of words from a Hollow mouth,” says Ian, “contains an abyss.” Soon the group is staging rituals incorporating sex, drugs and animal sacrifice.Anyone who has experienced mental illness – and many who have just been 15 years old – will find Pan uncannily familiarMeanwhile, Nicholas loses his ability to sleep and spirals toward psychosis. Clune is brilliant on the loss of control and exaggeration of terror that follows. Falling out of your face can be transcendence, but can also represent extinction. When Nicholas sees a black-and-white photograph of a group of long-dead priests, he reflects: “Now they’d all stepped out of their faces … The faces hung there like rows of empty sneakers in a shop window. The priests had stepped out.” At his hardware-store job, Nicholas sees the racks of garden tools and realises, “These are animals too … These are the husks, the waiting bodies, the body traps of animals.” He knows that if he stares at the hand spades and rotary tillers long enough, he can inhabit them; even household objects now have a door in the middle of them. Nicholas’s reality becomes fluid. Among his friends, he becomes the object of semi‑religious, semi-voyeuristic fascination. What is truly remarkable here is that the extravagance feels meticulously true to a certain state of altered consciousness. I doubt that anyone has had Nicholas’s exact experiences, or even ones that resemble them in obvious ways. Still, anyone who has experienced mental illness – and many who have just been 15 years old – will find even Clune’s most phantasmagoric pages uncannily familiar.There are trade-offs to fiction that strives to be honest. Here, one is that the other characters never fully become people. They’re external experiences that inform the way Nicholas relates to his own mind, and it’s often very credible that they are “Hollows” with no real consciousness. This may be a truthful depiction of the isolation characteristic of extreme mental states. It also means the story is unrelentingly solipsistic. The plot centres on inner epiphanies. While these present themselves as life-saving answers, they all turn out to be brief respites, some evanescing so quickly that they’re forgotten seconds later. It’s no surprise that Sisyphus appears as a reference here. This is certainly true both of coping with mental illness and surviving adolescence. It also risks making the reader feel as if we’re going nowhere.But this is not really to criticise the book: it’s just to say what it is and isn’t. A reader who approaches Pan expecting the usual rewards of a coming-of-age story will be sorely disappointed. It offers not answers but visions; not growth but lambent revelation; not closure but openings. “Good writing,” Nicholas tells us, is “the careful, painstaking replacement of each part of this world with a part that [looks] the same, but [is] deeper, more mysterious, richer.” This feels like a fair description of Clune’s own process, with the proviso that he is not replacing but supplementing; not substituting for reality, but adding to it. Nicholas ends his inner journey without arriving at the cure he has been pursuing. But when we close the book, we find ourselves in a larger world.Pan by Michael Clune is published by Fern Press (£16.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

But there is little to no music in this laborious slice of content, one of the many frustrating and disconcerting things about it. And for me, this film shows yet again that there is something about the Smurfs, those little Belgian creatures with blue skin and floppy-protuberant hats, which is basically kryptonite to comedy and entertainment.The script by Pam Brady (justly respected for her work on South Park andTeam America: World Police) follows the template of being pretty bland for the sweet Smurfs themselves, but is sharpened up with one or two properly funny lines for the all-too-brief scenes featuring the evil wizard characters Razamel and Gargamel (both voiced by JP Karliak) whom the Smurfs are up against.In the Smurfs’ home village, the one depressed Smurf is No Name Smurf (voiced by James Corden), who feels he has no real attribute or quality that marks him out. But then he discovers that he in fact has cosmic and magical powers, which are to come in vitally handy when the evil wizards kidnap Papa Smurf (John Goodman), intent on purloining a certain magic book secretly in his possession which would allow them, in concert with other wicked beings, to control the universe.This very uninteresting and uninspired story plods along for an hour and a half, though there are some almost-interesting surreal scenes when our heroes find themselves in weird alt-universe dimensions. There are also some decent gags featuring Sound Effect Smurf, who communicates in sound effects. But there seems to be a worrying assumption here that a film aimed at very little kids doesn’t need to have a very interesting or engaging story.Smurfs is out now in Australia, and on 18 July in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFamily filmsRihannaJames CordenJohn GoodmanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not only does it represent a new reimagining of an 87-year-old character, but it also has to tell everyone who David Corenswet is. The new Superman is a complete unknown to many of us, and you suspect that a hefty slice of the film’s promotional budget has been given over to selling the guy to the world.In the old days, this would have been achieved with wall-to-wall press interviews. Big, hefty cover stories in key publications in every territory, where interviewers would attempt to plumb the depths of his psyche to see if he can pass muster. But that hasn’t really happened. Instead, there is a very big chance that – if you’re the right age – you will have learned everything you need to know about David Corenswet from a couple of TikToks.Superman review – is it a bust? Is it a pain? James Gunn’s dim reboot is bothRead moreThe ones going viral at the moment show Corenswet’s undying, encyclopedic love of the Star Wars prequels. One of them, the one that has gained the real traction, sees him passionately argue that Anakin Skywalker would have had a profoundly different fate had he been trained by Qui-Gon Jinn and not Obi-Wan Kenobi.His argument is calm and fluid and eloquent. Most importantly, it shows a deep understanding of the worst films of an overcooked franchise. In other words, it’s the perfect demonstration of why he should be Superman.This isn’t an isolated incident, either. Much of the press for Jurassic World: Rebirth has revolved around the odd platonic showmance between Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey. In fact, watch any social clip of them gazing into each other’s eyes and giggling and it’s clear that they’re taking the lead from Wicked’s promotional cycle, which was fuelled by the social-driven narrative of Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivovariously crying, clinging to each other or talking in weird little baby voices.View image in fullscreenLove in … Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey at the Jurassic World: Rebirth film premiere press conference in Seoul.Photograph: Jeon Heon-Kyun/EPAIndeed, every new blockbuster released this year will follow a similar formula. The stars will make short clips that distill the correct facets of their personality into neat little nuggets, and a worldwide audience hungry for a parasocial relationship will do the rest of the work.Jurassic World Rebirth review – Scarlett Johansson runs show as near-extinct franchise roars back to lifeRead moreIt might sound depressing, but really it’s nothing new. Before this, movie studios attempted to achieve the same sort of thing with junket days; tightly controlled, daylong sessions where stars submitted themselves to dozens of four-minute press interviews a day. In theory these were great, because an actor could demonstrate charisma without having enough time to say anything inflammatory. But in reality they were dreadful.Junkets were exhausting and stressful for everyone involved, and the only facet of a personality that an actor ends up revealing is “person who is tired of repeating the same three answers 13 times an hour”. Fun fact: the only interesting thing that ever happened to me at a junket was when I was due to meet Reese Witherspoon on the day Osama bin Laden was killed, because right before it happened a furious publicist crashed into the waiting area and screamed: “Can everyone PLEASE STOP asking Reese Witherspoon about Osama bin Laden?” at the top of their voice.View image in fullscreenEmotional … Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande at the Wicked New York premiere.Photograph: Bruce Glikas/WireImageThe thing that grates about every iteration of this, old and new, is that this condensed presentation prioritises personality over the work. There are some of us, still, who want to hear about the actual films, rather than what a good boyfriend the actor would be for the internet. Regardless of the form, it’s a deliberate dumbing down.But still, as frustrating as this can be, at least there are holdouts. Serious film-makers – the men and women tasked with maintaining the high standards of the cinematic tradition – have yet to lower themselves to this model. But it might be coming. After all, anyone who saw the jarring video of Christopher Nolan playing along withWired’s Most Searched Questionsparlour game knows that it can only be a matter of time before he’s forced to promote The Odyssey by getting stomach cramps and going cross-eyed onHot Ones.And actually, now I come to mention it, there’s a very strong chance that your children primarily know who Martin Scorsese is because he acts like acutely bewildered old man on his daughter’s TikTok. You know what? It’ll all be so much less painful if we just submit to this. This is simply how movies are promoted.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Garlanded with superlatives, from “friendliest” and “happiest” to “world’s most sustainable city”, this breezy Nordic capital is fast catching up on its foodie neighbours. Enriched by immigrant chefs, the youthful, turbocharged culinary scene now abounds in excellent mid-range restaurants with affordable tasting menus – although wine prices are steep (from €10/£8.60 for a 120ml glass). Vegan and vegetarian alternatives are omnipresent, as are non-alcoholic drinks, many berry based. Tips are unnecessary, aesthetics pared down, locals unostentatious and dining starts early, at 5pm. And, this being Finland, you can digest your meal in a sauna, whether at an island restaurant (Lonna) or high in the sky on the Ferris wheel (SkySauna).Eat, sweat, swim – go Finn!NollaView image in fullscreenNolla has a Michelin green star.Photograph: Nikola TomevskiTop of the table in zero-waste cred is pioneering Nolla (meaning “zero”), which even boasts a designer composter in one corner. It serves regularly changing taster menus (four courses €59, six courses €69) in an old townhouse with a relaxed, hip vibe. Led by Catalan chef and co-owner Albert Franch Sunyer, the 70-seater espouses localism and upcycling: staff uniforms are made from old curtains and sheets, while the base of a wine bottle becomes a butter dish. Nothing goes to waste, whether leftover bread or used coffee grounds (an ingredient in a roasted hay ice-cream). Goose is a recent innovation, roasted deliciously with honey turnips, parsnip puree and hazelnut crumble, while Finncattle carpaccio with a radish and tomato harissa dressing brings an exotic hit. With aMichelin green star, Nolla’s easygoing atmosphere and strict environmental policies make it a winner.restaurantnolla.comMuruNot far from Nolla, in the popular central area, is long-standing Muru, one of the first French-style bistros in Helsinki. Masterminded by award-winning sommelier Samuil Angelov, it’s intimate, with a slightly worn, rustic edge and eccentricities that stretch to a wine store at the top of a vertiginous ladder. The changing menus (four courses €59, two courses €39) are chalked on a blackboard in Finnish, which any waiter will translate – English is virtually a second language in Helsinki. Depending on the season, you might indulge in a starter of lavaret (freshwater fish) with pickled cucumber, radishes and dill flower, a nettle risotto with rhubarb and parmesan (risottos are Muru’s speciality) and end with a luscious pannacotta and strawberry dessert.murudining.fiThe RoomView image in fullscreenA gilded turnip at The Room, where ‘gold rules’.Photograph: Fiona DunlopThis is where the Middle East comes to Finland – dramatically. Cloistered in a curtained room, 14 diners sit around a kitchen bar to watch Kurdish chef Kozeen Shiwan enact his gastronomic life story. This is represented by 14 meticulously conjured courses – from a single richly decorated olive (“Made in Suleymaniah) to a spicy quail’s leg buried in flowers (“Flora’s Quail”). Each dish is introduced by the chef’s witty patter. Gold rules, too, whether in Kozeen’s teeth, his necklace, or encasing a platter of glittering potatoes baked with amba sauce and roe before they sink into a mayo, saffron and olive oil sauce. It’s a memorable dining performance (€159), but make sure Kozeen is present on the night you book, and choose wine by the glass rather than the €119 wine pairing.kozeenshiwan.comFinlandia HallView image in fullscreenAlvar Aalto’s monumental Finlandia Hall.Photograph: Fiona DunlopNobody can visit Helsinki without paying homage toAlvar Aalto(1898-1976), the groundbreaking architect and designer who brought functionalism to Finland. After three years of renovation, his monumentalFinlandia Hall, an events centre which opened in 1971, now includes a sleekly designed bistro and a cafe. Everything in the building is by Aalto, from lighting to furniture and brass fittings, explained in an illuminating permanent exhibition. On the food front, the bistro (open for dinner Thursday to Saturday) offers typically creative Nordic cuisine with Mediterranean accents (four courses €59, six courses €69, plus à la carte) in a moody interior. For more luminosity, or for lunch, head for Finlandia Café&Wine (open all week), with terrace views over the bay. Self-service snacks and drinks are backed up by a daily lunch special (€14.70) or a copious breakfast (€19.90) – porridge included, of course.finlandiatalo.fiNokkaView image in fullscreenWarehouse spaciousness … Nokka.Photograph: Fiona DunlopDown on the south harbour, beside a stretch of other eateries, Nokka’s spacious warehouse is full of nautical artefacts and enlarged sketches of wild animals. The philosophy of chef-founder Ari Ruoho, a keen hunter and fisher, is to bring Finland’s peerless “wild nature” on to the plate, nose to tail. Apart from the wild meat, there is a huge emphasis on organic vegetables. There are three menus (four courses €89, vegetarian €74, eight courses from €129) and à la carte options. The smoked bream mousse starter with pickled cucumber, cucumber sorbet and a crispbread combining fish skin with dried roe and pumpkin seeds (€24) is a revelation, as is tender roasted reindeer, seasonal vegetables and roast potatoes with grated elk heart. This is ambitious, perfectly honed food that easily justifies its Michelin green star.nokkahelsinki.fiLonnaView image in fullscreenLonna restaurant.Photograph: Fiona DunlopSeveral thousand islands speckle the Gulf of Finland, so there’s no excuse not to hop on a ferry for a 10-minute ride to Lonna island. Here, recycling comes with a twist, as ageing military structures now house an eponymous restaurant with bar and terrace overlooking the Baltic. Add to that a beach, a sleekly designed sauna and views to Helsinki and you have a bucolic escape. The 60-seater Lonna restaurant is low key, with bare brick walls and gorgeous Finnish tableware, and is open May to September. Excellent-value menus (three courses €39) change monthly, offering local organic produce and plentiful vegetarian options, such as oyster mushrooms with barley and smoked tomato, or a meaty option such as organic pork with bok choi and trout roe.lonna.fiBona FideView image in fullscreenA tomato salad at Bona Fide.Photograph: Fiona DunlopIn an elegant residential neighbourhood, this quirky little restaurant offers a four-course menu (€48) tweaked every few weeks. “We do what’s in season, using French technique and good ingredients from abroad, and only wild game or fish,” says Ilpo Vainonen, one of the two young chefs who are co-owners with sommelier and manager Johan Borgar. Like many of their peers, they make their own bread, which comes with a black olive dip. Every dish is presented superbly: try a starter combining fresh and semi-dried tomatoes framed by hazelnuts, cream cheese and tiny cherries, or an ice-cream in a puddle of olive oil served with a pan of stone fruits poached in rum syrup. Suddenly, a spoonful of raspberry sorbet coated in pink peppercorn appears.

I looked through the fridge and raw compost bin, and found some squash, carrots, apples, cucumber ends, a knob of ginger and a woody stick of lemongrass; I even considered a red cabbage leaf, but decided that brassicas are best kept out of the baking tin. The compost bin is more than a place for leftovers, it’s a source of inspiration, as well as a way to reflect on what we waste; it can even guide us towards cooking more resourcefully and creatively.Compost cake with coconut icingThis is a fun riff on the classic carrot or courgette cake, designed to use up scraps of sweet fruit and veg. Be inventive but discerning with what you include, so think beetroot, squash, apple or citrus zest, and leave the garlic and red onion for another day. If you keep a raw-ingredient compost bin (we use a council-issued one), you can even pick through it for potential ingredients; if not, next time you cook, identify the scraps you could incorporate into this cake, so turning them into something delicious.I normally make this cake with extra-virgin olive oil or sunflower oil, but on this occasion I used leftover plant-based spreads from testing supermarket “butters” forthe food filter column. This recipe makes a large, moist cake that needs a good-sized pan and takes longer to cook than you might think.For the cake300g fruit and vegetable scraps(eg, beetroot peelings, apple cores, squash ends)300g oil, or plant-based spread3 eggs300g wholemealplain flour, fine milled ideally200g unrefined sugar3 tsp baking powderFor the coconut icing (optional)1 can full-fat coconut milk, chilled for at least 10 hours1 tsp vanilla extract65g icing sugar, siftedFinely grated zest of ½ orange, lemon or lime, plus a little extra to finish (optional)1–2 tbsp cornflour, or arrowroot powder (optional; this will make a firmer icing)Mixed seeds and chopped nuts, to top (optional)Rose petals, to top (optional)Start by making the icing. Open the can of chilled coconut milk and scoop just the solidified thick cream into a bowl, leaving the coconut water behind. Add the vanilla extract, icing sugar and, if using, the citrus zest and cornflour, whip until light and fluffy, then cover and put in the fridge.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put your chosen fruit and veg scraps in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add the oil, eggs, flour, sugar and baking powder, and blend again until just combined.Scrape the batter into a greased and lined cake tin, then bake for 55–65 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for five minutes, then turn out on to a rack. Once the cake is completely cool, spread the icing over the top, then scatter with seeds, chopped nuts, rose petals or/and extra grated citrus zest, if you like.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteVegetablesFruitCakeBakingDessertfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While I would never throw a classic out of bed, every now andd then I like to swerve the mayonnaise and do something a little more exuberant. Today’s potato salads are a riot of texture and flavour, and pack a serious punch. They are satisfying enough on their own, but serve them at your next barbecue and you are bound to please the potato pleasure-seekers in your life.Potato chaat salad with yoghurt (pictured top)You can find nylon sev in good Indian supermarkets or online, but if you can’t get hold of any, fistfuls of your favourite bombay mix will do just fine.Prep10 minCook30 minServes4For the date and tamarind chutney5 tbsp tamarind paste4 medjool dates, pitted1 heaped tbsp soft brown sugar½ tsp ground cinnamon½ tsp chilli powder, or to taste1 tsp cumin, toasted and coarsely ground1 tsp chaat masalaBlack salt(kala namak), to taste (optional)For the salad500g jersey royalsSea salt and black pepper400g tinchickpeas, drained and rinsed200g natural yoghurt1 handfulnylon sev, or good-quality bombay mix orsev mamra1 small red onion, peeled and cut into very thin rings1 handfulfinely chopped corianderSeeds from ½ pomegranateFirst make the quick chutney. Put the tamarind paste, dates and 300ml water in a saucepan, bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook until the dates are tender. Take off the heat, leave to cool, then puree. Stir in the sugar, cinnamon, chilli, cumin, chaat masala and kala namak, if using. The chutney should have a thick, pouring consistency a bit like ketchup, so add more water if required. Cover and refrigerate until needed.Chop the potatoes into bite-sized pieces, then boil in salted water until tender. Drain, leave to cool completely, then arrange the potatoes on a platter. Scatter over the drained chickpeas, season with sea salt and pepper, and mix. Drizzle over the date and tamarind chutney, dollop on the yoghurt here and there and top with the sev, onion rings, coriander and pomegranate seeds. Serve at once.Spicy peanut butter potato saladView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s spicy peanut butter potato salad.The spicy peanut sauce is very adaptable.
