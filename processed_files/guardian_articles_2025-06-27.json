The home Euros had swung the nation behind the team and women’s football has not looked back. What did the day of the final look like? Ahead of the Lionesses beginning their title defence, this is the inside story of English women’s football’s greatest day.Waking up on the morning of the final, there was an eerie air of calm and confidence in the England camp.Lucy Bronze, right-back:We stayed at The Lodge, at Tottenham’s training ground. It was the only night we moved hotels. The blinds were automatic and they opened on the hour, every hour, from one o’clock in the morning. So everyone came to breakfast with bags under their eyes and we were like: “Oh my God.” It wasn’t a great start. Fran Kirby was furious. She was so tired because she hadn’t had a good night’s sleep. I distinctly remember that.View image in fullscreenSport: Oral history of Euro 2022Composite: undefined/Guardian Design; Tom Jenkins/The Guardian; Lisi Niesner/Reuters; Daniela Porcelli/ShutterstockLeah Williamson, captain and defender:The blinds broke, opening and closing all night, and I’m thinking: “If we lose today it’s going to be because of the blinds.” And we were at Spurs, The Lodge, I had some feelings about that.Jorge Bronze, Lucy’s brother:We drove down the night before and stayed in Twickenham. I have a big soccer-mom-style van, so it was me, my wife, our at the time three-year-old and one-year-old, and my mum and dad. My one-year-old, Alzira, took her first steps. That was quite an exciting start. You’re already nervous but then you’ve had this fairly big child milestone in amongst it.Alex Greenwood, defender:If you’d have come into our camp in the morning, you’d have thought it was a day off. It was so relaxed, so chilled, you would not think we were about to play a Euro final. I’ve never felt a more confident team. I’ve never been around that before. It was quite special. Even when I went down to breakfast and I looked around the room, I was thinking: “We’re going to win today.” I could feel it. Not in an arrogant way at all, just in a really confident way.View image in fullscreenFans head along Olympic Way, between Wembley Park tube station and the stadium.Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty ImagesRobyn Cowen,BBC commentator:Waking up, I didn’t feel nervous, I felt really calm actually. I’d done a lot of work, so I felt prepared, which is not always the case, especially after becoming a parent, trying to find that time to do all the prep, but I felt calm and confident.Chloe Kelly, forward:I sent my family a message that said: “Let’s enjoy this special day, we don’t know how many of these moments we’ll get to spend together,” and I really remember messaging them saying: “Imagine we have anotherBobby Zamora moment, but it’s me.”Olympic Way was flooded with fans arriving at a sold-out Wembley,a record crowd for a European Championship final of87,192.Williamson:I was very, very emotional, I got a text from [former Arsenal and England player] Kelly Smith, we were driving to Wembley and the helicopter was following us. It was all very exciting. I’d been very excited for every game but I was nervous for the final. When Kelly sent me, that was what set me off.Deborah Dilworth,head of women’s football at the Football Supporters’ Association:It was the most magical day. Getting to the Wembley steps and feeling the atmosphere, wow. Not that anybody worried that there’d be the same situation as the year before [when fans without ticketsforced their way into the men’s Euros final] but it was so starkly different to feel the atmosphere, a beautiful buzz, as you went up to the stadium. There was just so much vibrancy and colour. It was like a bubbling excitement, not tension.View image in fullscreenFans inside Wembley stadium await kick-off.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianCowen:Around 1pm I arrived. I was in a Winnebago with our team, [BBC presenter] Gabby Logan, mystic Fara Williams [who had correctly predictedEngland’s semi-finalscoreline], Alex Scott, Ian Wright, Kelly Somers and then Rachel Brown-Finnis and a lot of the people who were looking after us, and it was weirdly calm. Rachel was your typical footballer – very superstitious. One of her superstitions was we would always have a pizza before the game, she had one before theSpain quarter-final, so she wanted one again.Lucy Bronze:I don’t remember much until the warm-up. I can’t even remember travelling to the game. I think, when we sat on the bus, we were just kind ofwitheach other.Jorge Bronze:We took the family and friends bus that was put on for us, an old-school doubledecker, and it was a ridiculously hot day. It had no air-con and we were stuck in traffic for hours on the way in. There was the option of going to a little pre-party but my stomach can’t take the nerves on a day like that so we were in the stadium while it was empty, before 4pm, right behind the dugouts. We’re all in with all the other friends and family. You always know who’s friends and families because they’re wearing shirts that are too tight, because they’re wearing one of their daughter’s actual worn shirts and we’re not as fit as the players.View image in fullscreenEngland warm up before the Euro 2022 final.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAkua Opong, a volunteerwith the Team London Ambassadorsprogramme:I spent much of the Euros at either King’s Cross or Piccadilly, helping fans with information to make their way across London to matches, but had an event clash as I was also volunteering at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. After finishing the shift I raced to find a television. I watched the final with a friend and it was chaotic. Everywhere was packed. We went from place to place looking for somewhere to watch it. We eventually ended up watching it in aWeatherspoon’s.Sophie Downey,writer and co-founder of Girls on the Ball:It was 10 years to the day that we’d been at Wembley for Team GB against Brazil, whereSteph Houghton scored to beat Brazilin front of 75,000 people at the Olympics. That was one of the real first catalysts for the growth of the game, the moment England woke up to the sport a little bit, and the game that triggeredGirls on the Ball, so to be there 10 years later was incredible. The difference was stark. There was such a buzz around the place.Just before the 5pm kick-off, news thatthe Germany forward Alex Popp had injured herself during the warm-up only furthered belief.Lucy Bronze:Sat in the changing room, the big talking point was thatPopp wasn’t playing. [Head coach] Sarina [Wiegman] came in and said: “Popp’s not even in the starting XI.” A huge part of our gameplan was how to stop her, but we were a bit like: “OK, it doesn’t really change much, we still have to play against good players.” That gave us a boost, though, knowing that one of the best players in the tournament wasn’t playing.Downey:It was England v Germany and anything could happen, but when we got the news that Popp was injured I had a feeling that maybe, maybe this might be England’s time.Dilworth:As the players came out for the anthem, I just thought, whatever happens, this is an iconic moment in women’s football and I hope the players enjoy it, but equally, the fans were massive in that tournament and deserve that moment just as much as the players. I thought: “This is it, this is ours, we’re going to win.”The hope and tension at kick-off were palpable.View image in fullscreenA packed and expectant Wembley stadium.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianCowen:Usually at Wembley, television commentators get a great view. For some reason, because it was a tournament, the broadcasters were shuffled around a bit and we were in a radio seat with a really bad view. That was my first “oh no” moment. This was a bit too low. We were also right in front of [BBC Radio] 5 Live, and because I’m very small, I have to stand up for 98% of games, but if I stood up here 5 Live couldn’t see. So I spent most of the match in a sort of half-squat position.In the first half, Germany were aggrieved that they were not awarded a penalty for handball in 25th minute when the ball appeared to strike Williamson’s raised arm.Williamson:I remember Rachel Daly shouting at me: “What’s the VAR check for?” I knew that it was going to be a close call. I still stand by the rules, it hit me on the top part of my arm, above my sleeve. Genuinely, after that, there’s only a couple of thoughts I remember, mainly that my c ousin was pregnant and I really hoped we wouldn’t go to penalties as I didn’t know if she was going to make it through that.Lina Magull’s79th‑minuteequaliser cancelled out Ella Toone’ssecond-half chip over Merle Frohmsand forcedthe final intoextra time.View image in fullscreenElla Toone chips Germany’s Merle Frohms to put England ahead.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Uefa/Getty ImagesJorge Bronze:I didn’t even feel nervous, because we were still on the right trajectory. We were pretty in control throughout I felt, like there was going to be a moment and it was coming. I had no fear of penalties coming. I was calm, which as a family member is not usually my experience. Normally I am sort of close to a mild heart attack watching Lucy play. But not at that final.Rachel O’Sullivan, co-founder of Girls on the Ball and a photographer at Wembley:I was sitting next to a German photographer. I don’t speak German, she didn’t speak English, but we were both living the opposite emotions. Every time Germany came forward, I was super stressed, and she was super excited, and vice versa. Even without really speaking, we knew what each of us were going through.Cowen:When it went to extra time, I was thinking: “OK, I know what’s going to happen here.” I started to draw out a penalty shootout grid. I’ve kept that page as a memento. I did feel that penalties was where it was headed; it was Germany, it would have been so “England” and there had not been a shootout in the tournament.In the 110th minute, England won a cornerand Chloe Kellyurged the crowd to makemore noise.Kelly:Using the home crowd for our advantage, I always do that if I can; gee up the fans a bit, and I tried in that moment to really get the crowd up and going.With penalties looming, Kelly pounced, turning in from close range and pandemonium ensued.View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly pokes in the winning goal for England.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianKhiara Keating,watching with her family from the stands,nowa member of the Euro 2025 squad:I could have cried. I was speechless. I looked at my mum and was like: “Has that actually just happened?” Then the whole stadium erupted and I thought: “Wow, we’re actually going to do it!”Kelly:My job is to be there for the drop-downs and to help get the keeper to stay in her goal, and as it dropped to me, I just thought: “Get this in!” Then I was just absolutely buzzing.Jorge Bronze:Lucy would claim an assist for Chloe’s goal. I think there was at least enough nudging around the box that Lucy’s presence caused some havoc for Chloe to then stick it in. We all basically started crying at that point.Dilworth:I hugged my dad and I was close to tears. I was just tingly at the fact we were moments away, it was a stunned feeling, of thinking about what this moment was in history for women. The greater meaning was bigger than the game.O’Sullivan:For these games, as a photographer, you never know which end to sit in is going to be the best end to be at to get the key goal. I was at the wrong end for the Chloe Kelly goal, but it didn’t matter. I was able to get much more of the crowd and much more the reaction. It was one of those games where it felt like things worked out the way they were supposed to work out.View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly rips her shirt off as she runs to celebrate the winner.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/APCowen:After Chloe Kelly scored, I was certain Germany weren’t coming back. It was just a masterclass by England to keep the ball in the corner. Players like Jill Scott in particular were absolutely brilliant and she had that iconic swearing moment [Her outburst went viral.Greenwood:I love how we kept the ball in the corner, I loved those bits of the game the most. After the goal, we were so good.Lucy Bronze:I was like: “Yeah, we’re England. We can see this game out. No problem at all.” I’ve not watched the game back, [but] I remember Chloe shouted at me at one point because she got a yellow card for taking her shirt off. Bear in mind, I played the whole game and she hadn’t, and she was like: “You’re going to have to waste time on the throw-in and get a yellow card because I can’t.” I was like: “You got a yellow card because you scored and I’m going to be the idiot getting a yellow card for wasting time?” I didn’t in the end, but I remember her saying: “You need to waste time for the team. I can’t do it.”The final whistle and trophy lift prompted an outpouring of emotionas well as reflectionhow far women’s football had come.View image in fullscreenAlessia Russo races away at the final whistle.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianWilliamson:Seeing everybody’s faces, I felt like I was on that pitch for ever. I’ve watched the game back every year but it’s an out-of-body experience. All we kept saying to each other was: “We did it.” That was the emotion. It was a thing to be done, and we did it.Jorge Bronze:The tournament felt like the first time in my experience where support for the women felt much more sincere, rather than: “Oh, aren’t the girls doing well?” There was a clear narrative shift, where actually winning the tournament became really important toeverybody. That felt like a moment in history. Meanwhile, my son, Freddie, sat with his iPad, headphones on, totally uninterested. He’d done well, it was a hot day, and my poor wife, Charis, had Alzira in a sling, roasting – not ideal. I remember then the prospect of being back on that sodding bus for another hour, but moods were elevated at that point.View image in fullscreenThe England captain Leah Williamson lifts the trophy at the presentation ceremony.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianCowen:I’m really proud that it’s my voice on the commentary of it but, because I was so focused on getting it right, I did slightly miss out on the “going berserk”, because it was more of a relief that I hadn’t said anything mad. At the end, I turned to throw to Rachel [Brown-Finnis] for some words and she was just crying. It was a lovely moment, because she, like all the ex-Lionesses, is so supportive and I’m in awe of them; how none of them are bitter that they didn’t have these advantages, the pay players get nowadays, in their time. Instead they’re just so humble and just so proud to have played for England, so I was so pleased for her, in particular.View image in fullscreenRevelling in the moment: (from left) Lauren Hemp, Lucy Bronze, Nikita Parris and Demi Stokes.Photograph: Lynne Cameron/The FA/Getty ImagesDowney:I was just a wreck. I was sitting next to a journalist from the men’s game who I think had come in thinking it was just an average day at the office but by the end, as I was sobbing into my hands next to him, he went: “Enjoy this moment, they don’t happen very often,” and he really understood the gravity of it and how much it meant to those of us who have been plugging away in the game for a very long time. Then you have to then go and work, which I found really hard and odd. I had to put the game face on again to do thequotes piece for the Guardian. So I went and sat in Sarina’s press conference and that was absolutely crazy because the players came in, Mary Earps got up on the desk and danced and the players were all singing. Very, very special memories.View image in fullscreenLucy Bronze (left) and Mary Earps dance on the press conference table.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Uefa/Getty ImagesGreenwood:The moment the final whistle went, it was like an out-of-body experience. When I recall that game, I think about nothing but the final whistle and that pure relief. I don’t know whether I ran forwards, backwards, maybe I went to Leah first. I have no idea. All I know is it was one of the best moments of my entire life. The stadium sounded incredible.Celebrations on the nightspilled into Trafalgar Square the following day.Kelly:It was nice to spend time with every family, it was such a special night. The girls created special memories. To do it on home soil was incredible, having all my family in the stands. All my brothers, my sister, my little nephews, my nan, my mum and dad, my now husband Scott, were all there.Cowen:Back in the Winnebago, it was total euphoria. Fara Williams had somehow managed to procure a bottle of prosecco from somewhere, and she popped the cork inside a very small Winnebago, which probably wasn’t the safest thing. We put on music and danced around for a little bit, before going for some food and a bit to drink, but I had a child at home. In hindsight, I shouldn’t have gone home so early, but even in the moment, I thought: “I want to go home to see my family.” And then, for my sins, I do love a KFC, I only treat myself to one when it’s a really good game and I thought: “Robyn, you deserve it,” so I had chicken and chips around midnight.View image in fullscreenThe victorious England team take to the stage at Trafalgar Square.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianJorge Bronze:We went into the hotel and waited for the players to arrive and there were crowds of people at the hotel. We stayed there until about 1am. Georgia Stanway got some Maccies [McDonald’s] in, because you’re not allowed to eat shit during the tournament, so the first thing was like: “get some Maccies”. So, I’ve got some great photos of Luce sat with a trophy and Freddie stealing some chips, wearing the medal. I put them [his children Freddie and Alzira] in their car seats to go back to the hotel and they both fell asleep instantly.View image in fullscreenLucy Bronze with her niece and nephew eating McDonald’s with the Euro 2022 trophy and medals.Photograph: Jorge BronzeOpong:When you get to experience certain moments in life, take it. If you can go, go. They’re once-in-a-lifetime experiences, so I just had to beat the parade in Trafalgar Square. I can’t put it into words. I remember leaving the parade thinking: “I don’t even know what I’ve just witnessed.” Every single one of those women who won the Euros have given so much back to communities. They showed what you can achieve with teamwork and cohesion. They’re such a special unit.England start their defence of the European Championship against France on Saturday5 July."

Just in case you’re not familiar with who she is, her set opens with a helpful explanatory video emphasising her cultural impact with testimonials from Kelly Clarkson, Halsey and (actual Glastonbury headliner) Olivia Rodrigo, as well as clips from interviews giving a brief overview on her views (anti-war; “naturearchy” over patriarchy).This brazen American narration letting you know that you’re about to see a seven-time Grammy award-winner and a Very Influential Artist strikes a slightly odd note (or maybe just an un-English one). The spirit of Glastonbury, after all, is one where even the biggest star in the world must profess earnest and heartfelt gratitude for having been permitted to so much as cross the threshold of this holy ground; Morissette’s video intro, emphasising her importance – under-acknowledged as it may be – risks setting expectations unattainably high.View image in fullscreenMorissette on the Pyramid stage.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAHowever, when Morissette takes the stage, she is very quick to show that she deserves them. After a little trill on her harmonica, she introduces One Hand in My Pocket, one of her best-known songs. It’s a smart move, not only inviting the audience to join in with its built-in choreography (one hand making a peace sign, one hand holding a cigarette – good luck hailing that taxi cab!) but also signalling that she’s setting out to play a crowd-pleasing set, and not planning to hold back on the hits.For anyone who has cared to see beyond her reputation as the Canadian singer of Ironic and/or an angry man-hating feminist – as she was persistently dismissed, even at her career peak – Morissette has always been defined by her voice. It’s both incredibly powerful, capable of the octave-jumping acrobatics that define pop’s most lauded singers, but also – more unusually – idiosyncratic: you don’t have to be very familiar with her back catalogue to be able to do a quickly guessable impression.Thirty years on from her album Jagged Little Pill, no one would fault Morissette if she wasn’t able to summon the raw power that made that album so enduring. It’s defined of course by You Oughta Know, a song that makes every other song subsequently described as having been “inspired by female rage” (and there have been many!) sound as if they were written by ChatGPT. But if there were any doubts about her voice among the crowd, Morissette dispels them instantly, really putting some welly into her trademark warble, even for One Hand in My Pocket – one of her lower-intensity hit songs.“Got some pipes on her, eh,” my sister messages me from elsewhere in the field and I can only agree. The focus of this set is on Morissette as a singer, as much as a songwriter, and it’s refreshing – after a decade now ofwhisperpop, and even the angriest young feminists in pop seemingly struggling to actually raise their voices – to hear what a well-trained diaphragm is capable of.Perhaps relatedly, Morissette keeps the chat between songs to a minimum, thanking the crowd with an ear-to-ear smile then launching into Right Through You. On the screen behind her, a series of stats scroll through highlighting the multi-faceted grim reality for women today, still – from higher rates of depression and anxiety than men, to a tiny share of the world’s total wealth, to dismal stats of partner violence. It makes explicit the sexism and disrespect that has dogged Morissette through her career and brings it into the anniversary set, concluding the song with the question: “Why are we afraid of the divine feminine?”View image in fullscreenLetting the songs speak for themselves … Alanis Morissette.Photograph: Anna BarclayMorissette lets the question hang, or lets her songs speak for her. She introduces her band one member at the time, saving the crowd from the typically long list of names, but otherwise keeps focused on the set. When she launches into Hands Clean, another belter, you may be starting to realise she’s got more great songs than you remember.The sheer proliferation of hits, many from Jagged Little Pill alone, keeps the set pacy. Head Over Feet, featuring a harmonica solo, lifts the energy after the earlier sobering messaging. Her charm as a songwriter lies in this duality of perspective, with Morissette being equally capable of razor-sharp clarity and also the feminine right to set it every aside once in a while.A rhythm emerges to the set where, along with the member-by-member introduction to her band, Morissette showcases her vocal skills before launching into the song itself. The life-affirming energy of You Learn is lost to Smiling, a dirge-y ballad most reminiscent of Evanescence, which only Morissette seems to enjoy, twirling around on the stage as though entirely alone.But Ironic is triumphant, a big singalong that gets everyone up and on their feet, even at the very crest of the hill – and You Oughta Know is ironclad, as powerful and shockingly direct as on your-ever listen. When Morissette concludes her set with Thank You – after of course thanking us, the audience, for the “bucket list” show – she seems to mean it and the feeling is mutual.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Alanis MorissetteGlastonbury festivalPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

He had been safely tucked up in bed when he got the message from No 10 that the government was doing the mother of all U-turns on the welfare bill. The third U-turn in a month or so and by far the biggest yet.It wasKinnock’s bad luckthat he had been booked to do the government’s morning media round. He had been told it would be a doddle. A chance to talk about better provision for people with poor mental health. The sort of good news slot a minister dreams about.Now he could forget it. No journalist would be interested in anything but the latest crisis. He would be the one left to carry the can. Even though it was really nothing to do with him. It was the price of being halfway up the food chain. Little power, but all the responsibility for the coming hours. This had better not become habit-forming. He didn’t want the No 10 communications team to get ideas. He wasn’t about to become Labour’sMel Stride.On Radio 4’s Today programme, Nick Robinson could barely contain his excitement. Nick lives for these days when everything a government tries to do comes crashing down around it. This was his idea of fun. The highlight of his Glastonbury weekend. Like headlining the Pyramid stage. He glanced into Stephen’s eyes and saw only an abyss of human misery. Better and better.No 10 climbs down over welfare bill in move to win over Labour rebelsRead more“So,” said Nick, not bothering with any niceties. Like, would you like some Valium? Or intravenous morphine? This late-night U-turn was a complete shitshow, wasn’t it? The sign of a government in complete disarray.Stephen took a deep breath and mouthed the platitudes he had been coached to say by No 10. The U-turn wasn’t a U-turn. Rather it was a sign of a positive and constructive debate. Even as the words escaped his lips, he could feel something inside him die a little. He felt grubby. Compromised. But he couldn’t stop now. He was committed. His career depended on it. His ambition and self-worth on a fatal collision course.Here was the moment of weakness. Nick loved the smell of bullshit in the morning. Made it worth the 3am start. Time to go in hard. So let’s think this one through, he continued. For months, No 10 had ignored the Labour backbenchers. Then it had panicked when it realised that126could kill off the welfare bill at second reading. First calling the backbenchers “noises off”. Then caving in. How much worse could things get?There was a pause. Stephen was about to say “hold my beer”. Instead, he stared balefully at the miserable script he had been given and carried on. The chaos was a sign of order, he insisted. This was how grownup governments operated. Normally, all the arguments took place at the committee stage. By having them now, they were streamlining the process. Efficiency savings in action. A government delivering on its promises. Would that do?It wouldn’t. Nick started to sound a little bored. This was all too easy. He had been hoping for more resistance. But Kinnock had all but caved in immediately. Still, there was more time on the clock so he might as well fill it. This wasn’t about reform, it was about cost-saving. The changes in personal independence payments had been inserted by the chancellor to balance the budget.“This is about dignity and respect,” sobbed Stephen. Only, just not for him. He had lost both at about the time the interview had started. So this was a pure Freudian slip. As if realising the hole he had dug for himself, he chose to throw Rachel Reeves into it as well. If he was going down then she could go down with him. However much he was being paid to make himself look a halfwit, it wasn’t nearly enough. Over to you, Rachel. You can explain where you’re going to fund the £3bn that the changes are going to cost. Nothing to do with me.By now, the script that Kinnock had been given was drifting in and out of focus as his heart rate and blood pressure rocketed. Nothing to do but continue. The reforms would now be staggered. Another Freudian slip. He was losing control. The person doing the staggering was him. By now only semi-conscious. Stephen Timms would be doing a review so why not ask him what he thought in a year’s time.Nick went for the kill. This was the third U-turn after the winter fuel allowance and grooming gangs.

Especially when he had visions of doing unspeakable things to Nick. No hard feelings? Only a few …Earlier on Today, Meg Hillier had had her own mini-embarrassment as she tried to explain how she was now delighted with the changes the government had made. Meg is not one of parliament’s natural troublemakers and had always been desperate for the government to meet her halfway. She had never wanted to cause a scene unless absolutely necessary and was thrilled that a compromise had been found.Only, halfway had turned out to be somewhat arbitrary. One rule for those already receiving benefits, another for those who may need them in a year or so. It all made sense to Meg. If no one else. In Megworld, the people with current disabilities are all that count. They should get the dosh. But it was quite right that future stroke victims should be made to suffer. The threat of less money would make them try that bit harder to dress themselves. Create aspiration in a demoralised nation.It all smacked a bit of desperation. The work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, sent a letter to all MPs, the subtext of which was: “Help! I don’t know what I’m doing.” Meanwhile, No 10 declared it was a listening government. Everything was going entirely to plan. So that’s all right then.Explore more on these topicsWelfareThe politics sketchStephen KinnockLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Nutritionists recommend the smartest ways to indulge (including a healthy kebab!)Kate WillsFri 27 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTShareWe all know we should be snacking on blueberries and eating more leafy greens. But what should you do when you’re stuck at a motorway service station with a choice between crisps and more crisps? If you can’t resist a glass (or two) of wine, what’s the healthiest option? And is it possible to hit the kebab shop at 1am without being struck down by the spectre of Gwyneth Paltrow?Not all junk food is created equal. Top nutritionists suggest the treats, booze and ultra-processed foods that pose the smallest risk to our health – and the ones even they eat from time to time.The least processed crispsAlthough nobody would count crisps as one of their five a day (a shame, because theyaremade from potatoes), if you swerve the flavoured options, some packets aren’t too bad as far as snacks go. “Look for an ingredients list that contains just potatoes and ideally extra-virgin olive oil and maybe sea salt,” says Dr Federica Amati, the author of Everybody Should Know This and the head nutritionist at the health science company Zoe. “You want them to be lightly salted, not very salted.”Contrary to what you may think, those chickpea and lentil crisp alternatives might not be better for you, Amati says: “Read the back of the packet carefully as they might contain lots of additives, flavour enhancers and emulsifiers to make them taste good. You’re often better off having a simple, traditional crisp and not eating too many. Think Kettle Lightly Salted, or even Walkers Ready Salted, rather than Doritos Flamin’ Hot.”Low-sugar sweetsLots of gummies now claim to be “sugar-free” or “natural” and come in healthy-looking packaging, but is a saintly sweet an oxymoron? “Traditional gummy sweets and chewy candies are textbook UPFs and normally loaded with glucose syrup, artificial colours, flavourings and gelatine,” says nutritionist Rob Hobson, author of Unprocess Your Life. “Plain liquorice is a better option, but check the label as the proper stuff should only contain minimal ingredients such as molasses, flour and aniseed extract.”For Amati, “a sweet is always a sweet, but opt for brands that don’t contain palm oil, which has a high saturated fat content. Candy Kittens and Biona are good examples. If you consume sweets in moderation and practise good dental health afterwards, they’re not too bad.”Chocolate that’s good for you“Dark chocolate typically contains less sugar than milk or white,” says the nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert, author of The Unprocessed Plate. “Opting for varieties with 75% cocoa or higher not only reduces the sugar content, it can also support a more diverse and flourishing gut microbiome. Dark chocolate is rich in polyphenols and antioxidants that may support heart health by improving blood flow and reducing inflammation.”For bonus points, choose a dark chocolate with nuts in it. “Almonds or hazelnuts provide healthy fats, fibre and micronutrients such as magnesium and vitamin E,” says Lambert. But what if you’re not a fan of dark chocolate? “Choosing a milk chocolate bar that includes whole nuts can still be a more balanced option.”Amati says you should still check the label on your dark and milk chocolate: “Look for cocoa butter or cocoa mass on the ingredients list, as some brands replace it with cheaper, more saturated fats. And avoid any additives, emulsifiers and sweeteners.” Vegetable or palm fats, lecithin, monoglycerides, and diglycerides of fatty acids are all red flags.Gut-friendly drinksWe all know that fizzy drinks are full of sugar, artificial sweeteners and other additives, but sometimes nothing hits the spot like a cold can of pop. “There are now lots of probiotic soft drinks on the market,” says Amati. “The jury’s still out on how effective they are for gut health, but many of them are low in sugar and have no artificial sweeteners or added sugar, making them a good option.”Hobson says swapping standard fizzy drinks forkombucha(fermented tea) is a smart move: “Opt for varieties with live cultures, that are unpasteurised and with no added sugars.” He favours Momo Kombucha (“It’s raw unfiltered and brewed in small batches with organic ingredients”), and Remedy Kombucha (“It’s fermented to the point where sugar is virtually eliminated”). Other kombucha brands with low sugar content include No 1 Living, Holos and Jarr.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Tal Silverman/The GuardianThe least calorific lagerThey don’t call it the “beer belly” for nothing, but is it possible to sip a pint without derailing a diet? “Lagers that have ‘light’ in their name, or low-alcohol beers, are generally your best bet,” says Lambert. “That’s because the majority of calories in beer come from its alcohol content – the higher the alcohol by volume (ABV), the more calories it tends to contain. For example, a standard lager contains about 150–200 calories per pint, while a low-alcohol or light lager can come in closer to 80–100 calories.Go for ‘light’ lagers – the majority of calories in beer come from its alcohol contentThese options still offer the refreshing lager taste, just with fewer calories and often less impact on hydration, and sleep too. If you’re watching your intake, always check the ABV and aim for beers that are around 3% or lower.” Small Beermakes a lagerthat’s 2.1% and only 73 calories a can.The wine least likely to give you a hangoverIt was bad news for the “everything in moderation” brigade when a 2022 study found that even a small amount of alcohol has negative health outcomes. But if you are going to have a glass of wine, is there a grape that’s less grim than the others? “Hangovers are usually the result of a toxin called acetaldehyde (the byproduct of alcohol breakdown), dehydration and compounds called congeners, which are more prevalent in darker and cheaper wines,” says Hobson. “It’s for this reason that white wine gives you less of a hangover than red. Sulphites often get the blame, but unless you’re genuinely sulphite-sensitive, they’re unlikely to be the problem.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionHowever, organic or biodynamic wine does tend to have fewer additives overall, and often lower levels of sulphites and residual sugar, so they can be a better choice. Wines from cooler-climate regions such as the Loire valley or parts of Germany are usually lower in alcohol (11-12%), and you can now buy specially made low-alcohol wines that can make a difference to your hangover. It’s also a good idea to go for dry wines rather than sweet ones, as less sugar can mean less of a headache the next day.”But, ultimately, it’s about pacing yourself, not drinking on an empty stomach and drinking water alongside alcohol. “Even the cleanest, most ‘natural’ wine won’t save you from a hangover if you drink too much,” says Hobson.The fizzy wine with the least sugarBeware the bubbles – fizz has been proved to cause worse hangovers than any other kind of wine. But if you want to raise a toast, which is the best for you? “The fizzy wines labelled Brut Nature or Extra Brut contain the lowest levels of residual sugar – typically under 6g per litre,” says Lambert. “Whether it’s prosecco, champagne or cava, choosing one of these dry varieties is your best bet. Avoid styles such as demi-sec or doux, which have a much higher sugar content.”The best of the breakfast cerealsBreakfast cereals get a bad rep on the UPF front, but some are much healthier than others. “Yes, Weetabix is technically a processed food, but it’s low in fat, high in fibre, affordable and delicious,” says Amati. “About 90% of adults in the UK are fibre-deficient and breakfast cereal is an easy way to up your intake.” Amati also favours Dorset Cereals and jumbo steel-cut porridge oats. “Making it in the microwave is fine,” she says. “Just avoid quick-cook oats (as these have been more processed and so make your blood sugar spike) or flavours or sweeteners.”Beware of that healthy-looking granola – it may not be as good for you as you thinkAnd beware of that healthy-looking granola – it may not be as good for you as you think. “Many are heavily processed and contain high levels of added sugar, emulsifiers and refined grains,” says Lambert. “Opt for ones with a low sugar content – ideally less than 5g of free sugars per 100g – and made from whole ingredients such as oats, nuts, seeds, maple syrup or honey, and dried fruit.”Bio&Me Granola has just 4.2g of sugar per 100g, compared with 15g in the same amount of Jordans Simply Granola.The most virtuous takeawayNot all takeaways have to come with a side order of guilt. “In general, avoid deep-fried food,” says Amati. “Some places cook in saturated fats and keep reusing the same oil.” Instead, head towards your local Thai, Vietnamese or Indian restaurant. “Choose the veggie option, such as a chickpea, paneer or spinach curry. These are all fibre-rich, whole foods.” And don’t order the rice. “It’s much better – and cheaper – to make rice at home using packets of parboiled rice you can buy in the supermarket. When you reheat cooked rice the starch is more resistant, which is better for blood sugar control and improved gut health.”Hobson favours a Turkish takeaway. “I would go for a grilled chicken shawarma wrap with salad, hummus and a wholemeal flatbread,” he says. “This option is balanced with lean protein, fibre and healthy fats. These kind of places often offer fresh vegetable and grain-based salads such as tabbouleh, bulgur salads or ezme, which are rich in fibre and other key nutrients.”The best pre-packaged sandwichThose chilly, limp pre-made sandwiches are never the most satisfying, but if you have to grab one, which is the lesser of the UPF evils? “Look for those made with wholegrain or seeded bread, as they provide more fibre and keep you fuller for longer than white bread,” says Lambert. “For the filling, lean protein such as falafel, hummus, chicken, egg or tuna are all good options, especially when paired with salad or crunchy vegetables. Creamy sauces, excessive mayonnaise or cheese-heavy fillings can push up the saturated fat and salt content up quite significantly, so it’s worth being selective.”If in doubt, focus on fibre. “The nutrient most of us are probably deficient in is fibre, so if you’re checking the nutrition label, check the fibre content, and try to pick one that gets you as close as possible to 3g of fibre per 100g. It’s a helpful benchmark for knowing you’re getting a more satisfying, gut-friendly choice.”Explore more on these topicsDiets and dietingNutritionHealth & wellbeingUltra-processed foodsFast foodFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is a look in Alexia Putellas’s eye, a light. “You know that feeling, that sense of security when it’s like you’re capable of anything?” the double Ballon d’Or winner says, leaning forward on a sofa at Spain’s Las Rozas HQ.“At that moment, I felt it. And now I’ve got that feeling once again. I’m happy; the desire for these Euros is huge. I can’t wait to start, to go and give my everything.” And Alexia Putellas’s everything iseverything.These are her third Euros – she scored a 94th-minute winner against England on competitive debut in 2013, aged 19, although she does not remember ifshe was given the goal– an indicator of how far she has come. Not only since 2013 but since the last time too. Switzerland stands as a kind of redemption, a reclaiming of her place after an English summer, and so much more, was taken from herby a torn cruciatesuffered at Bisham Abbey a day before Euro 22 began.It was, she says, anhostia, the worst of blows. “I had felt really good, and then … I knew the moment it happened. I heard a sound like a branch breaking. ‘No, not now.’ You never expect it, but at that moment. It’s the day before.”Putellas had arrived asthe world’s bestplayer, thetournament’s greatest icon, but when theselecciónkicked off in Milton Keynes she sat by the touchline in a baseball cap and Virginia Torrecilla’s shirt,crutches at her side. Two hundred and ninety-nine days would pass until she played again. Two years passed, two more operations – a World Cup, two league titles and a Champions League, attention and affection turned elsewhere – before Putellas was Putellas again, not just physically but emotionally. “People don’t know that with injuries you train more than when you’re healthy but you don’t get the reward of playing,” she says.“I’m competitive and you set yourself challenges: ‘When can I start walking?’ ‘A month.’ ‘OK, in three weeks, I’ll be there.’ But at first there’s nothing. Just pain. And I felt a lotof pain. I couldn’t sleep. I didn’t have any appetite. It was a vicious circle. To even move, you have to …”View image in fullscreenBarcelona’s Alexia Putellas lifts the Women’s Champions League trophy. ‘There’s a moment I feel liberated and that’s Bilbao.’Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersPutellas hauls her leg on to the sofa, a demonstration of the dead weight. “Post-op I had a very bad time,” she says, and it is not as if what followed was much easier either. “You go from playing at a stratospheric level to not being able to walk, not knowing how, learning aged 27, 28.“You get to the gym, which is at least your habitat. Then the pitch, where you think you’re progressing but frustration comes because your last memory playing was like that and now you can’t play a pass, can’t turn, can’t control. There are times you wonder [if you ever will].”“They warn you that the day you get the medical all-clear, play again, it’s still not done: you need time, adaptation, competition. Don’t think you’ll be the same; that’s just not real. You still have three, six months. You have to try to give yourself that margin, control your emotions. And right in the middle of that period is a World Cup.”Putellas returned in late April 2023, after 10 months out. But given the final minute of the Champions League final, reward after her rehabilitation, she arrived at the World Cup having made six appearances, all as a substitute, and those warnings are not always easy to hear. “You don’t go thinking: ‘I’m in that three-to-six month period’; you go thinking: ‘I’ll give my best.’“Two years later, I see it: my level is completely different, even if at the time you don’t realise. You’re not the same physically as before. There are things going on, too. I arrived feeling confident; then came[defeat to] Japanand I was the head cut.”Did she feel singled out? “No, not singled out. I understand that if things aren’t working the coach has to change someone and it was me, and that’s that.”That wasn’t that, however. Putellas played an hour in the semi-final and a minute in the final.Spain’s historic win, secured by a squad including only three of 15 players who had pulled outdemanding improvements, was overshadowed by the Spain federation’s president LuisRubiales’s unsolicited kissof Jenni Hermoso.Again,Putellas took the lead, which was not to say it was welcome, rather that responsibility demanded it. “I wish it hadn’t happened,” she says. “You try to tell yourself: ‘It’s great, we’ve just won the World Cup,’ but you see the press, people, everything, and the focus isn’t there. It was a shit situation, unpleasant, a burden.”View image in fullscreenAlexia Putellas holds the Women’s World Cup trophy alongside Jennifer Hermoso and Irene Paredes.Photograph: Pablo GarcíaIn November Putellas underwent another operation, this time on hermeniscus, a common consequence of cruciate tears. She missed 21 matches through to March, the doubts increasing, people saying her moment had passed, that she wouldn’t ever be the same.“I’m not going to lie: it gets to you,” she says. “There are those close to you going through it, suffering, thinking you won’t make it. I understand because the reality is there are cases where players don’t get back, and it’s not personal. [But] people don’t know.”In part that goes with being Putellas: the world’s best player, a footballer of huge symbolic significance, subjected to an exposure unimaginable before. A leader in the fight for professionalisation. A Ballon d’Or winner too, The Queen. “It’s been hard for me to come to understand that,” she says. “I see football collectively, everybody equal. At first, it was difficult to manage the attention. I was very introverted. And when the individual awards started arriving it was like: ‘I don’t understand this’. With time, I came to feel: ‘Well, they’ve put you there, fate wanted you there: use it.’ A lot of what I did wasn’t for me, but to make the game grow.“Take the Prime documentary: I didn’t want to do it. I said no four times. I watch a lot of sports documentaries and one day I was looking for one about a sportswoman. I only found Carolina Marín, the badminton player. That was the click. And I said: ‘Do it’.”Did you like it? Putellas smiles. “They might kill me for this, but I haven’t seen it. I mean, I saw it, but before it was finished. I know how I am. I don’t have the ego to watch myself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Starting with the management of this injury, the management of expectation, the management of the pressure and everything. But for better or worse, I’m Alexia.“Now I handle that better. I don’t focus on the [eulogies] or those who want to kill me. A friend said: ‘I don’t know how you do it but they either love you or hate you.’ I try not to focus on either.”Well, most of the time, motivation found in those who doubted she would return. “To tell the truth, that was also fuel, petrol. A challenge,” Putellas says. “Like: ‘You’ll see.’” Oh, they see.View image in fullscreenAlexia Putellas expects a ‘hard, hard’ Euros for Spain.Photograph undefined: Pablo GarcíaPutellas arrives at the Euros as one of the continent’s outstanding players, scorer of 22 goals last season and provider of 17 assists, directly involved in a goal (score, assist) every 44 minutes for Barcelona. Voted player of the season in Liga F, she has created more chances than anyone in Europe’s top five leagues. AS summed it up: “The best Alexia is back, or maybe even better.”When she returned to a struggling Spain side in February, six months later, she led a hammering of Portugal, a glorious roulette drawing a standing ovation from Vigo’s Balaídos stadium. Defeat to Arsenalin the Champions League finalhurt – it still does – but en routeshe had scored or assisted against every European opponent. It has been coming a year since the previous season’s final, a refound consistency positioning her as a Ballon d’Or candidate again at 31. “There’s a moment I feel liberated and that’s Bilbao,” she says.With five minutes remaining in the 2024 Champions League final against Lyon, she was sent on to protect a one-goal lead; instead she scored the goalthat secured the title. Barcelona were European champions again and she was bowing before fans, 697 days after her cruciate tore.“Physically you can be good, but if mentally you’re not there, you’re tense, you can’t control yourself as you did. It’s not that I came off the pitch that day thinking: ‘I can do it,’ so much as: ‘That’s it,’ ‘time’s come.’ The cruciate, the meniscus, the whole injury: you’ve closed that cycle. Done. I felt free. And from there, I’ve felt super good.”So here she is, 12 years on from her first Euros, three from what should have been her last, a legacy already left and more to leave. She gestures towards the end of the corridor, to the dressing room. Their dressing room now, their own place. Small details, she says, but ones that matter.“I remember the first time [in 2013] perfectly. There’s a goal that hit my pony tail and we won 3-2,” Putellas recalls. “I picture myself as a girl, I hardly knew where I was. Everything has grown. I’ve developed as a woman too. That day, I would never have imagined how things are now, for me or women’s football.“That was a moment of transition, and I lived both eras. However much I wanted to be a footballer, if everything isn’t [in place], you won’t be; you couldn’t plan this career. I like this sport so much I’m enjoying it being professional. It’s nothing like then. It’s a joy now here; I hadn’t lived this, ever.”“I think these Euros will be unique. It’s the trophy we’re missing, and we feel it could be now, but we’re facing very good teams and we know it’s a hard, hard journey,” Putellas says.“The cruciate was one day before it started last time, which was very tough to take. And on top of that just when I had felt really good, too. It’s been a long time, and people really have no idea what you go through but this year I have that feeling again. The challenge for me now is to keep going or even get better in these Euros. I just want to play football.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Euro 2025Spain women's football teamWomen's footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Top takeout? Anna’s revolution is over. She lost. Not personally, of course – she accrued significant riches herself, and her name is literallyhewn into stoneover a chunk of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Just don’t call her Ozymannadias! But the things she represented are over, and nothing illustrates it in quite such withering fashion as the gathering on the Grand Canal of Instagram’s apex predators.Don’t worry – this isn’t going to be another article over-egging the fact that someone has unfurled some protest banner or something on a Venetian church. Very little needs refreshing quite as desperately as the eat-the-rich genre, which has started to feel even smugger than the super-rich themselves. I think we can all live without people who positively adored it when George and Amal Clooney took over Venice fortheir 2014 weddingnow wetting their pants when the Bezos-Sánchezes do it.Besides, these days the super-rich behave more like revolutionaries than those supposedly committed to overthrowing them. Listen, I don’t love the result – but you can’t deny they’ve got on a lot better with ripping everything up than their opposition.Anyway: the revolutionary style. British Vogue recently declared that “chic is dead” – a comment that would probably have had to have been approved up the food chain in New York by the famously controlling Wintour. And certainly, someone as – how to put this? –aesthetically sensitiveas Anna might have found it difficult this week to watch aseries of Kardashianstramp down a series ofVenetian jettiesin a series of$10,000 bras. And yet, in her twilight professional years – and make no mistake, we have been living through them – Wintour ended up courting all these figures. Kim Kardashian was eventually admitted to Wintour’s Met Gala in tacit recognition of her then-unparalleled ability to create moments on the internet, a medium that had completely eaten magazines. Sánchez was“helped” by Wintourwith her outfit choice for her own Met debut, as well as given a Vogue photospread.All of that read like Wintour reluctantly having to attach herself to a type she’d spent such ferociously studious decades keeping out. They were the way the wind was blowing, and it was better to be borne along by it than blown into irrelevance. But that in itself was the writing on the wall: Wintour was no longer making the weather. It is said she “advised” Sánchez in some capacity on her clothes for the current wedding celebrations. Maybe the only thing worse than helping Lauren with her outfits is not helping Lauren with her outfits.And yet, if the second Mrs Bezos wants the clothes, she just buys them. Quick word on the Sánchez aesthetic: you might have heard of trends such as stealth wealth, quiet luxury, whatever. Forget about those. Lauren wants to look really rich and really sexy and like she’s having a really good time, all of the time. In Venice,in space, at the presidential inauguration. And if you’re even remotely tempted to comment that, actually, you don’t find that type of look sexy, then you’ve missed the absolutely key thing about Lauren Sánchez, and what makes her hilariously, invigoratingly iconoclastic in contrast with the billionaires’ wives of yore. She literallydoes not carewhat anyone else thinks. Like, not at all. Sorry!Congrats to Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez on the wedding – and to Venice for running them out of town | Emma BrockesRead moreHer entire look says, “I am wearing this and I don’t care what you think”, whereas Wintour presided over a world where rich women’s looks said, “I am wearing this and I do care what you think.” Back in the day, someone passing from mere riches to mega-riches had a minefield to navigate, and knew it. The mines were mostly laid by women who’d got there about 10 minutes before them. Every single parvenue society queen felt this, and some even wrote it down. Barbara Amiel’smemoir describesthe milieu she moved into with her marriage to Conrad Black in excruciatingly absurd detail. Here she is, a billionaire’s wife, yet gripped by constant social anxiety, forever agonising that she’d worn her best rocks to an event that actually called for “patio jewellery” (necklaces $1m or under). She is constantly finding herself looking too much or too little. “You don’t wear white,” a caring society assassin tells her about the colour of her shoes. “It’s for sales girls.” As Amiel reflected: “I was consumed by fear of not doing it right.”In order for there to be people worried about getting it wrong, there had to be people decreeing what was right. And for a very long time indeed, the empress of those people was Wintour. She was a rarefied being who knew better than you, who had the power to help or hinder your passage even further up society’s Mount Olympus, and who acted as a trusted and feared gatekeeper to a world in which you were, in some ways, still the rube you started out as.Even figures as recent in the timeline as Kim Kardashian kept the old ways and bent the knee to Wintour, but maybe Kim was the last.Things go out of style – perhaps including style itself. Certainly capital-S style, as decreed by Wintour herself. If there’s afin-de-sièclevibe hanging over the Bezos wedding, it’s Anna’ssiècleit’s thefinof. The happy couple and their tribe have the distinct air of having only just got started.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsAnna WintourOpinionJeff BezosWeddingsVenicecommentShareReuse this content"

Many MPs are still undecided about how they will vote and are pressing for more assurances that it is ethical and legal to set up a division between current and future claimants.Disability charities have said the bill remains “fatally flawed” and will lead to an “unequal future” for different groups of disabled people, making life harder for hundreds of thousands of future claimants.The government confirmed on Friday night that people who have to make new claims for Pip after November 2026 will be assessed under the new criteria. This means those reapplying after losing their Pip or who have fluctuating health conditions will not have the level of their previous awards protected.Starmer defended the bill on Friday, saying it struck the right balance. The changes will protect 370,000 existing recipients who were expected to lose out after reassessment.The prime minister said: “We talked to colleagues, who’ve made powerful representations, as a result of which we’ve got a package which I think will work, we can get it right.”Reeves expected to freeze income tax thresholds to raise funds after welfare U-turnRead moreAsked how the government would pay for the £3bn of concessions, which experts believe will have to be funded by tax rises or extra borrowing, Starmer replied: “The funding will be set out in the budget in the usual way, as you’d expect, later in the year.”There would need to be at least 80 rebels to defeat the bill, and government sources were quietly confident they had given enough ground after Meg Hillier, the chair of the Treasury committee, said she would back the legislation following changes.Others were unconvinced. One leading rebel said “everyone but a handful of people is unhappy”, even if they do end up reluctantly backing the changed legislation. Another expressed frustration that No 10 and the whips were “trying to bounce people into agreeing before we’ve seen enough details”.Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, a leading opponent of the bill, said: “They are going to have to go back to the negotiating table … deaf and disabled people’s organisations are rejecting these changes as it fails to address future need and gives no security for people with fluctuating conditions, for instance where people are in remission.”View image in fullscreenThere have been widespread protests against the bill since it was announced.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyOther critics who plan to vote against the bill include the MP for Crawley, Peter Lamb, who said: “Despite many improvements to the system set out in the bill, at its core the bill remains a cost-cutting exercise. No matter the level of involvement of disability groups in co-producing a scheme for new applicants, to save money the new scheme has to result in people with high levels of need losing the support necessary to wash themselves, dress themselves and feed themselves.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionSimon Opher, the MP for Stroud, said he still opposed the bill. “The changes do not tackle the eligibility issues that are at the heart of many of the problems with Pip [personal independence payments]. The bill should be scrapped and we should start again and put the needs of disabled people at the centre of the process.”Diane Abbott, a leading figure from the left of Labour, said the rebellion was “far from over”, while another Labour MP said: “The bill starts from the premise of cuts, not reform. It’s also arse about face in terms of impact assessments and co-production. It’s simply a negotiated dog’s dinner. In that sense, nothing has really changed except the fact they’ve negotiated more [people to] misguidedly to sign up to it.”One thing Labour MPs are pushing for is more clarity on the review of the Pip system, due to be done before autumn by Stephen Timms, a work and pensions minister. Many expect that process to change the points system from the current proposals. Some in the party also want Starmer to reinstate Vicky Foxcroft, who quit as a whip to vote against the bill before the U-turn was made.Stella Creasy, a leading Labour MP who had initially signed the amendment to delay the bill, said she wanted to see more details. “We need to understand why we would treat one group of claimants differently from another,” she said.A Labour MP from the 2024 intake said: “I’m waiting to look at the details before making any decisions. Many are in the same place as me and need to get something more than a midnight email on an issue of this much importance to hundreds of thousands of people.”The Labour MPs opposed to the changes are citing a fundamental rejection of the idea that a Labour government will be making disabled people worse off. At the same time, many of them have also been alienated by what they say is a No 10 operation that is out of touch with the parliamentary party, and has tried to strongarm MPs into backing the legislation with threats and promises of preferment.“Good will has been lost and there is still huge suspicion about whether they will try and pull a stunt at the last minute,” said one Labour MP.The majority of disability charities and campaign groups still opposed the cuts. Ellen Clifford, from Disabled People Against Cuts, said: “Many people who rely on Pip to survive have fluctuating conditions which means our support needs can go up and down. By penalising existing claimants if we go out of and then go back to the benefits system depending on our health, more people will be denied the support they need.“This is exactly why no disabled people’s organisation across the whole of the UK has welcomed these concessions because we know the complexities of the social security system and bitter experience from years of cuts that there are many ways in which grand sweeping statements about protections translate to very little in practice when you go into the detail of it.”The disability equality charity Scope said that despite the concessions, an estimated 430,000 future disabled claimants would be affected by 2029-30.Welfare bill: what compromises have been made and how will claimants be affected?Read moreIts strategy director, James Taylor, said: “It is encouraging that the government is starting to listen to disabled people and MPs who have been campaigning for change for months. But these plans will still rip billions from the welfare system.“The proposed concessions will create a two-tier benefits system and an unequal future for disabled people. Life costs more if you are disabled. And these cuts will have a devastating effect on disabled people’s health, ability to live independently or work.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareKeir StarmerEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This trip was particularly hazardous, it’s understood, because the officers travelled to the country without the knowledge of its government, and would have been illegal under international law.The investigation is believed to have lasted in one form or another for up to 20 years, but MI5 could not establish whether British intelligence had a mole – raising the possibility that an agent may have got away with spying for Russia.“We thought we had another Philby on our hands,” said a source, referring toKim Philby, the infamous MI6 double agentwho was part of a group of Britons recruited by the Soviet Union, known as the Cambridge spy ring.View image in fullscreenKim Philby, who was the ‘third man’ in the Cambridge Five spy ring.Photograph: PA MediaMI6, the Secret Intelligence Service, is the UK spy agency responsible for overseas intelligence collection and agent handling; MI5, the Security Service, is the domestic intelligence agency that assesses threats to Britain’s national security.The MI5 investigation began in the 1990s and is understood to have continued until at least 2015. By then, the officer being targeted by the Wedlock team had left MI6, which employed a staff of 2,500 at the time.The tipoff about the alleged spy came from the CIA in the US, which was convinced a British intelligence official who was working in London had been relaying secrets to Russia.During part of the investigation, Russia’s secret intelligence service, the FSB, was being run by Vladimir Putin.A source with close knowledge of the operation said: “[We were told] the target was a Russian spy … The US believed he was leaking information to the Russians. He was suspect 1A. The job was taken more seriously than any other [MI5] was involved in. Wedlock eclipsed them all.”The operation began in the mid-to-late 1990s after the CIA told its counterparts in British intelligence about its concerns.A recently published book, The Spy in the Archive: How One Man Tried to Kill the KGB, by the former BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera, references the episode. The book says the CIA was concerned that an MI6 officer had been “turned by Moscow”, but that it was unclear who it was.The Guardian has discovered that the UK identified the alleged spy and a team of MI5 specialists was tasked with following him. The team did not operate from MI5 headquarters at Thames House in Westminster.Such was the sensitivity, the officer who led the surveillance was briefed about the operation in a church, according to a source. Some of those selected to be involved in the operation were initially told they were going on a training exercise, and were only given the terms of reference when they were outside Thames House.The Wedlock surveillance team was based in a building in Wandsworth, south London – close to MI6’s riverside building in Vauxhall. The officers operated there under the name of a fake security business.At the time, the team was told the target had a senior role at MI6 with access to a wide range of highly sensitive material. MI5’s technical operations team, known then as A1, covertly broke into the MI6 officer’s home and planted listening and video devices.

The extensive surveillance highlighted some conduct that raised cause for concern, but this was unrelated to spying, the Guardian has been told.During the course of the operation, surveillance teams tracked his movements abroad, following him to cities acrossEurope, Asia and the Middle East, a very high-risk move as the team was operating outside MI5’s jurisdiction.The Guardian has been told the team was sent into a country with real passports under false names, with the agents warned that if they were detained for any reason, they were “on their own … we can’t help you”.Such was the concern about the alleged mole, intelligence chiefs considered they had no choice.The man being surveilled was not thought to be working alone, a source said. Two other people, also based in London, were thought to be helping him. The source said Wedlock was a “highly unusual operation … the longest in recent memory and probably the most expensive”.To have one UK intelligence agency in effect spying on another was extraordinary, the source said. “MI5 never got the conclusive proof it was looking for,” they added. They said that if it was not him, then potentially MI6 “still has a mole to find”.One concern among those who worked on the operation was that the target, a specialist himself, might have become aware he was being watched.A Whitehall source declined to comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But it didn’t stop it being so amazing to see her. She was brilliant, the new songs were great.”Setting the tone for the day, it was the sort of magical start that has become synonymous with the Glastonbury experience: unexpected, emotional, energetic, enigmatic.View image in fullscreenLorde during her not-so-secret set.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Hogan Media/ShutterstockThrough sunny intervals and 25C temperatures, festivalgoers meandered through the fields of Pilton dressed in outfits ranging from practical Patagonia to tutus and superhero and pirate costumes.Early arrivers on Wednesday were treated to a circus performance on the Pyramid stage – a quiet affair, given that Glastonbury’s licence does not allow for loud music until Thursday – in which spectators hummed and sang along to large samba drums.Supergrass opened the festivities on the Pyramid stage, the indie rockers’ 1995 hit Alright – with its tribute to the rebellious spirit of youth – a fitting anthem for the occasion.Charli xcx and Neil Young to Juan Atkins and the Asian underground: what to see at GlastonburyRead moreMusic fans were looking ahead to another 90s veteran, Alanis Morissette, making her Glastonbury debut in the 30th anniversary year of the release of her record-breaking album Jagged Little Pill, and another rumoured “secret” set from Lewis Capaldi, who has only recently returned to performing after taking a two-year hiatus to focus on his mental health.Chase Bartlett, 28, from Bristol, started his day queueing for an hour with friends for warm showers near the Acoustic stage. “Everyone’s very happy, having a good time,” he said. Queueing with him, Danielle Vincent, 29, from Bristol, added: “It’s like a different planet. You can’t describe what it’s like here to somebody that’s not been.”“You see all sorts,” Bartlett said. “I saw a man on the phone to a potato and then he gave it to another man who started playing it: it was a harmonica.”Bartlett saw that Robbie Williams had posted an image on Instagram from the festival and was convinced the former Take That member was playing one of the many secret gigs. “And we’re going to see Loyle Carner tonight and can’t wait,” he added.Carner headlines the Other stage on Friday after an appearance from the hip-hop legend Busta Rhymes.The customary flag-waving crowd were in full force, with Palestinian flags particularly prominent in a year of increasing geopolitical unrest, although nauseating puns were abundant too, along with apparent in-jokes and surreal tributes to dead pets.View image in fullscreenFlag-wavers were in full force.Photograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APKneecap’s appearance on Saturday was being hotly discussed among the crowd, interest piqued by the controversy the Irish-language rappers have courted in recent months. One of the group, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, has been charged under terrorism laws and is on bail. Senior politicans, including Keir Starmer, have said the band’s inclusion on the bill was inappropriate.Sarah Hall, 34, from Ipswich, said she had been to Glastonbury three times and always thought of it as a political festival. “The festival supports great causes and charities, and I would expect nothing else from it this year. Things feel a bit heavy out there so I would expect Glastonbury to sort of deal with that.”Michael Eavis: people who disagree with Glastonbury’s politics can go elsewhereRead moreBut alongside the serious issues of politics, war, climate emergency and equality, there are countless moments of escapism and joy. From the circus performers to the hippies in the healing fields, Glastonbury is a place where people come together to celebrate life.The Greenpeace stage hosted a Letters Live event, in which a variety of letters spanning centuries were read by some surprise celebrities, including Benedict Cumberbatch, Bella Ramsay, Andrew Scott, Paapa Essiedu, James Norton and Simon Pegg.Highlights included a deeply poignant letter from a soldier in 1944 to his lover, a fellow soldier who had died the previous year, read by Scott, and a funny proposal letter written in 1866 by a Middlesbrough farmer to a woman he wanted to marry, in which he said he “had my eye on you for a long time”.To big laughs from the crowd, Norton, in his rarely used Yorkshire accent, read: “I shall marry you on May Day or if my mother dies afore, I will marry you afore.”And Glastonbury is no stranger to weddings.

The soldiers said they had concerns about using unnecessary lethal force against people who appeared to pose no threat.Haaretz also quoted unnamed sources as saying that the army unit established to review incidents that may involve breaches of international law had been tasked with examining soldiers’ actions near distribution locations over the past month.In a statement reported by Israeli media,the IDF rejected the accusations, saying that no forces had been ordered “to deliberately shoot at civilians, including those approaching the distribution centers”.“To be clear, IDF directives prohibit deliberate attacks on civilians,” the IDF said.In a joint statement issued late on Friday, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and Israel Katz, the defence minister, accused Haaretz of “malicious falsehoods designed to defame the IDF, the most moral military in the world”.View image in fullscreenPalestinians carry humanitarian aid packages near the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation distribution centre on Thursday.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APFood has become extremely scarce in Gaza since a tight blockade on all supplies was imposed by Israel throughout March and April,threatening many of the 2.3 million peoplewho live there with famine.Since the blockade was partly lifted last month, the UN has tried to bring in aid but has faced major obstacles, including rubble-choked roads, Israeli military restrictions, continuing airstrikes and growing anarchy. Hundreds of trucks have been looted by armed gangs and by crowds of desperate Palestinians.On Thursday, 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike targeting Palestinian police distributing flour in a market in the centralGazacity of Deir al-Balah, medical officials said.The strike appears to have targeted members of a security force set up by the Hamas-led interior ministry to target looters and merchants who sell stolen aid at high prices.The unit, known asSahm, or Arrow, confiscates stolen aid which it then distributes. Witnesses said many of the casualties were ordinary civilians who had gathered to receive sacks of flour from a warehouse near the Baraka crossroads in the northern part of Deir al-Balah.The dead included a child and at least seven Sahm members, according to the nearby al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital, where casualties were taken. There was no immediate comment on the attack from the Israeli military.Razeq Abu Mandil, a paramedic from the al-Maghazi refugee camp, said: “Among the injured were men, women, and children. In my ambulance, there was a woman and her daughter – both wounded.“When we arrived, there were people torn to pieces – severely wounded and dead … We started transporting the injured and the dead to the hospital, then returned again to load the ambulances. I repeated this three or four times. The situation in the hospital was catastrophic.”Friday briefing: How ​years of ​siege, ​war and ​blockade ​led to ​the ​unravelling of Gaza’s ​economyRead moreAhmed Abu Zubeida, 36, from nearby al-Bureij, was among the wounded.“I was far from the point of impact but some shrapnel injured my leg. I looked around and saw people lying on the ground – torn bodies, wounded individuals, blood and its smell filling the air, cries and screams,” he said.The strike came shortly after Israel closed crossings into northernGaza, cutting the most direct route for aid to the parts of the territory where the humanitarian crisis is most acute.View image in fullscreenA mourner during the funeral of Palestinians who, according to the Gaza health ministry, were killed in the strike in Deir al-Balah on Thursday.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersFor most of the war, aid in Gaza was distributed mainly by the UN and other international humanitarian organisations, but Israel said Hamas diverted and sold supplies to finance its military and other operations.The UN and other aid groups deny the charge and say their monitoring of their distribution networks is robust.Israel has backed an American private contractor, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which started distributing food boxes in Gaza last month from four hubs.To reach the GHF sites, which open intermittently and unpredictably and often at night, Palestinians must cross rubble-strewn roads and Israeli military zones where witnesses say troops oftenfire on themwith mortars, tanks and machine guns.A senior aid official in Gaza said many of the shootings occurred in darkness when civilians gathered near Israeli troops to wait for distribution sites to open or to receive aid looted from trucks.“The soldiers fire to keep them away, or because they don’t know who is there, or because they don’t care, or all three,” the official said.Medical records from independent NGOs working in Gaza, seen by the Guardian, confirm hundreds of lethal injuries from bullets and some from shelling.The IDF insists its internal processesare robustbutcriticssay few investigations are thoroughly pursued and only a tiny fraction result in any sanction.Israel has continued to allow a smaller number of aid trucks into Gaza for distribution by the UN and other organisations, with about 70 entering the territory each day on Monday and Tuesday. On Thursday, Israel shut entry points used to access directly the north of the territory, where the need for aid is greatest.António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said on Friday that the US-backed aid operation in Gaza is “inherently unsafe”, giving a blunt assessment: “It is killing people.”“People are being killed simply trying to feed themselves and their families. The search for food must never be a death sentence,” Guterres told reporters.The war was triggered by a Hamas attack on southern Israel in which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage.The overall death toll in Gaza in the 20-month conflicthas reached 56,331fatalities, mostly civilians, according to local health authorities.Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGazaWar crimesIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Homophobic comments and an “unhappy working environment” were also reported.A separatereport from a cathedral “visitation” teamrecommended the appointment of “strong leadership” to “steady the ship”, improved scrutiny of governance and finances, and discouraging unkind and inappropriate private communications.According to Tim Wyatt, who writesThe Critical Friend, a newsletter on the Anglican church, and who has closely followed events at Bangor, the reports “pretty much confirmed there was a lot of drinking, sleeping around, backbiting, bullying – basically a whole culture that was completely out of kilter with what a place of Christian worship is supposed to be about”.View image in fullscreenBangor cathedral. Andy John, who is also the bishop of Bangor, said he was announcing his ‘immediate retirement’.Photograph: UK City Images/AlamyIn addition, six “serious incident reports” have been sent to the Charity Commission in the past 18 months, four relating to safeguarding and two relating to financial matters.Financial irregularities reportedly includemore than £400,000 being spent on new furnishings for the cathedral with inadequate consultation, and £20,000 spent on trips to Rome and Dublin for senior staff.A spokesperson for the Charity Commission said: “We have opened a regulatory compliance case to assess a number of concerns that have been raised related to Bangor cathedral and diocese, including matters reported directly to us by the charities. We are actively examining these matters with the charities’ trustees to determine our next steps.“As regulator, if we find evidence of wrongdoing, we take robust action using the powers available to us.”Many of the concerns about the cathedral centre on a period when Siôn Rhys Evans was its acting dean – in effect chief executive – while continuing in post as secretary of the Bangor diocese. Both posts are senior full-time jobs, and it is unprecedented for one person to manage both sets of responsibilities and workloads.In another highly unusual move, Rhys Evans – who was seen as a protege of John – was made acting dean only a few years after being ordained as a priest. To be elevated so quickly to a high-profile job was an “astounding over-promotion”, according to Wyatt.In February 2024, Rhys Evans stood back from both roles without explanation. He was absent from work for 10 months, after which he quietly left to take up a new post as dean of a Westminster theological college in Cambridge.On Friday, Westminster college confirmed that Rhys Evans’ probationary period was “unsuccessful” and he had left his job in mid-May. The Guardian has been unable to contact him.Last month, two members of the cathedral’s college of priests, Rev Dr John Prysor-Jones and the Very Rev Prof Gordon McPhate, called for an independent inquiry into events in Bangor. “The reputational damage to the cathedral, the diocese, and the Church in Wales is considerable,” they said in aletter to the Church Times.Ruth Jones, the Labour MP for Newport West and Islwyn, said the church must give a full explanation to members and the public. “We want openness and transparency in all our church settings and it’s really, really important that the archbishop makes clear what has gone on,” she toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast.Explore more on these topicsAnglicanismWalesChristianityReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

No final decision has been made.Workers at the factory, in a former second world war bomber facility, have not been informed of the plans. Lotus declined to comment on “rumours and speculation”.If the company goes ahead with the plan it is likely to be heavily criticised in the UK, as it comes only eight years after Geely took majority control of the British company in 2017. A previous leader at the company said in 2023 that making cars in the UK was “part of our DNA”.The Norfolk factory has not built any cars since mid-May. The company said in a statement that it had paused production to manage inventories and supply chain issues caused by the US’s extra 25% tariffs on car imports. UK car production fell to its lowest level since 1949 in May in response to the tariffs.The factory could close as soon as next year, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the development.Lotus was founded in 1948 by the car engineer Colin Chapman and gained a reputation for lightweight British sportscars. Geely, which is owned by the billionaire Li Shufu, has stakes in a wide range of car companies, from the UK’s Aston Martin to Germany’s Mercedes-Benz and Sweden’s Volvo. InChina, Geely makes vehicles under its own name, as well as under the Lynk & Co and Zeeker brands.Geely also owns the London Electric Vehicle Company, themaker of London black cabs.Since taking over Lotus, Geely has shifted its focus to China, where it makes its electric SUV, the Eletre. In 2023,Geely listed the electric carmaking arm of the business, Lotus Technology, on the New York stock exchange.Geely had planned to increase annual production to 150,000 by 2028, with the bulk of those cars made in Wuhan, China. However, the New York listing left the original Lotus business in the UK standing alone without access to the same significant investment as the Chinese operations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The report said the hacker also “used Mexico City’s camera system to follow the [FBI official] through the city and identify people the [official] met with”.The report said “the cartel used that information to intimidate and, in some instances, kill potential sources or cooperating witnesses”.The report did not identify the alleged hacker, attaché or victims.The US embassy in Mexico referred questions to the state and justice departments, who did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The FBI and a lawyer for Guzmán did not immediately return messages seeking comment.The collection of granular location data from people’s phones by a wide variety of commercial and official actors, combined with ever-growing coverage of surveillance cameras, has posed a thorny problem for intelligence and law enforcement officials, many of whom rely on confidential informants.The report said that recent technological advances “have made it easier than ever for less-sophisticated nations and criminal enterprises to identify and exploit vulnerabilities” in the global surveillance economy.It said the FBI had a strategic plan in the works for mitigating those vulnerabilities and made several recommendations, including more training for bureau personnel.Explore more on these topicsMexicoDrugs tradeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The album, Never Stop, credits King Combs, 27, as the lyricist, and Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, as a producer.Prosecutors have accused Sean Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Records, of running a criminal enterprise that engaged in sex trafficking, drug distribution, kidnapping, forced labor, arson and bribery, and coercing women, including his former partner singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, into participating in drug-fueled sex marathons.Combs’s legal troubles kicked off in late 2023 when Venturafiled a lawsuitaccusing him of rape and severe physical abuse over the course of a decade, and said he used his power and status to keep her trapped in the relationship. The lawsuit wassettledthe following day for $20m, but Combs soon faced dozens of lawsuits from others accusing him of sexual and physical abuse.This week’s lawsuit claims that in 2017 Justin Combs, 31, lured the alleged victim, an “accomplished, degreed professional”, to Los Angeles with the possibility of a job, promising to use his father’s connections. She was, the suit alleges, flown to Los Angeles and taken to a high-end Beverly Hills property where she was eventually drugged and repeatedly raped by Justin Combs and his father and two “unknown, masked” men over the course of a weekend.Justin Combs allegedly held the potential job “over [the] plaintiff’s head” as well as “risque” photos she had sent him.The suit accuses Sean Combs of a “pervasive history of sexual assault and violence”.“The conduct described herein is strikingly similar to how [the] defendant Sean Combs and his entourage conducted themselves for many years, and it appears that Combs’s penchant for sexual violence is shared by his son,” the suit states.The woman is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for the assault, which, according to the suit, left her with “severe emotional distress, emotional anguish, fear, anxiety, humiliation, embarrassment, physical injury, emotional injury and trauma”.In a statement to media, Combs’s legal team denied the allegations, stating that “anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason”.The statement said: “No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won’t change the fact that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone – man or woman, adult or minor.”Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Byron on the prowl. Rising water levels. Cruise ships the size of city blocks.Venicemay have endured many tumultuous events and sinister challenges over the centuries but rarely in its long history has it had to contend with an issue quite as odd and quite as divisive as the sort-of nuptials of the world’s fourth-richest person.Friday morning found the lagoon city doing what it does best: looking gorgeous and slightly unreal as it played host to thousands of tourists who posed in silver-prowed gondolas, chugged mid-morning spritzes or simply wilted in the muggy heat.But across the water from St Mark’s Square,Jeff Bezosand Lauren Sánchez’s big day was getting under way. The precise choreography of events may not have been clear, but an elaborately planned and stealthily executed operation was unfolding on the tiny island of San Giorgio Maggiore, where the couple would later pledge eternal love and fidelity before a crowd of 200 mainly famous guests.View image in fullscreenJeff Bezos leaving the Aman hotel on Friday afternoon.Photograph: Yara Nardi/ReutersA handful of camera crews mooched around the entrance to the Giorgio Cini foundation, where a pair of tight-lipped but polite individuals sat before monitors under a gazebo and politely fended off requests for information.And no, they really didn’t know when the ceremony would begin. According to reports, the couple had already tied the knot in the US, making Friday’s event as symbolic as it was expensive.The long Venetian afternoon stirred from its torpor at 5pm when Sánchez emerged from the Aman hotel, wearing a cream suit, sunglasses and a headscarf. The bride then boarded a water taxi that ferried her past the legions of photographers and over to the island. The groom, dressed in black tie, followed an hour later.Bezos wedding annotated satellite imageDespite the heavy media presence and the epic scale of the festivities, however, not everyone on San Giorgio Maggiore was fizzing with excitement.Hosing down the deck of his boat in the island’s harbour, 100 metres away from the venue, one local man had offered a laconic and not untypical take on what has become known, a little tediously, as “the wedding of the century”.What did he make of all the fuss? “I’m not thinking about it at all,” he said. “I don’t care.”View image in fullscreenSánchez waves from a boat on her way to San Giorgio Maggiore.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APThe wedding celebrations – which began in earnest on Thursday night and are due to culminate in a reception held at the Arsenale historic shipyard complex on Saturday – have split the city into three groups. There are those, such as the yachtsman, who simply don’t care; there are those furious that Venice is prostrating itself before a man with an estimated net worth of $212bn (£154bn), and then those who, like the city’s mayor, see the £40m extravaganza as a welcome money-spinner and a wonderful showcase for the area’s attractions.Bezos and Sánchez’s famous friends do not appear to have been put off by the controversy, and there have been imaginative protests over the past few days – including rumours of a reserve armada ofcanal-blocking inflatable crocodiles.View image in fullscreenOprah Winfrey and Orlando Bloom leave the Gritti Palace hotel, on the second day of the wedding festivities of Bezos and Sánchez.Photograph: Manuel Silvestri/ReutersThursday night’s welcome party in the cloisters of the Madonna dell’Orto, a 14th-century church in the Cannaregio area, was attended by celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady and Orlando Bloom.But it was followed by yet another resourceful display of disapproval. A little before 11pm, a green laser was used to spell out the slogan, “No Kings, No Bezos”, on the belltower in St Mark’s Square. Similar guerrilla actions over recent days have included the unfurling of a banner reading: “If you can rent Venice for your wedding you can pay more tax.”Those behind the protests – a coalition of groups angered by the selling-out of the city, housing activists and anti-cruise ship campaigners – say their punning“No Space for Bezos”alliance has already paid off. They claim their sustained pressure, not least the threat to deploy the blow-up crocodile fleet, had prompted the couple to switch the location of the reception from the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, a majestic 16th-century building in the city centre, to the more private Arsenale.Others have a different take on the superyachts and the 90 private jets that have descended on Venice this week. The city’s mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, has dismissed the protesters as “shameful” and said the Bezos-Sánchez union will fill Venetian coffers.View image in fullscreenThe ‘No Kings No Bezos’ protest sign in St Mark’s Square.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APThat view is shared by Italy’s tourism minister, Daniela Santanchè. “There will be photos everywhere, social media will go wild over the bride’s dress, over the ceremony,” she told Associated Press.“All of this translates into a massive free publicity campaign. In fact, because they will spend a lot of money, they will enrich Venice – our shopkeepers, artisans, restaurateurs, hotels. So it’s a great opportunity both for spending and for promoting Italy in the world.”View image in fullscreenThe Bezos lookalike Cagdas Halicilar.Photograph: Sam Jones/The GuardianOne man, however, had his very own reasons for wishing the Amazon founder all the best.Cagdas Halicilar, a 47-year-old German who runs a delivery truck company, has a sideline as a pretty convincing Bezos lookalike.He had travelled to Venice to greet and confound the crowds and was also hoping for a quick encounter with Bezos so that he could give him the €3,000 (£2,600) bottle of whiskey he had bought him as a wedding present.“I realised the resemblance three years ago,” he said. “My life has changed a lot since then. Wherever I go, people are like, ‘Jeff! Jeff!’”He had come tantalisingly close to his doppelganger on Thursday night when a beautiful burgundy boat cruised past him. “He saw me and I waved and he gave me a thumbs-up,” said Halicilar. “I was so happy. I cried.”If the German delivery boss does finally get to meet Bezos, he has a simple message. “I will just tell him that I’m proud to look like him. That’s all. He’s not arrogant and he has a big heart. He makes people smile and I’m a huge fan.”(He also hopes that if Bezos is reading this piece, his people can arrange a meeting to hand over the whiskey.)View image in fullscreenLeonardo DiCaprio keeping a low profile while boarding a boat.Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersAs the day wore on, the secret preparations continued and the vicious June sun beat down on tourists, guests and journalists, one visitor making her way around San Giorgio Maggiore shook her head. This was all proof, if further proof were needed, of the awesome power of the 21st-century super-rich.“It’s grotesque,” said the woman, who was from northern Spain. “Two hundred and fifty guests and a bill of €50m?

It seems to have worked.After Trump landed to Washington from this week’s Nato summit in The Hague, the White Houseposted a videothat made clear how his team felt the trip had gone.The summit had concluded on Wednesday with a joint press conference in which Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, after showering the US president with compliments over his actions on Iran, bizarrelyreferred to him as “daddy”.Rutte was now being widely derided for the summit’s“orchestrated grovel”andattempting to row backon his choice of language. In Washington, however, Team Trump were enjoying themselves.“Daddy’s home!” trilled the video, which mixed clips of Trump’s handshakes with world leaders with footage of crowds awaiting his motorcade, soundtracked by a 2010 song by Usher: “And I know you’ve been waiting for this loving all day …”The tone of Rutte’s public bootlicking had been muted compared withthe text messageshe had sent to “dear Donald” before the summit – “Congratulations and thank you for your decisive action in Iran, it was truly extraordinary … you will achieve something NO president in decades could get done” – and which the president had immediately leaked. “I think he likes me,”smirked Trump later, while his cabinet giggled behind him.Ass-kissing, arse-licking, brown-nosing, sucking up – there is a reason metaphors for obsequiousness so often involve body fluids and the backside, because the act of sycophancy demeans both the arselicker and the arselickee.What is more cringeworthy, after all – the clips of Trump’s cabinet members taking turns to parrot praise of his leadership and vision, or the fact thathis fragile egodemands lavish compliments before he can get down to work?No doubtall the president’s yes-menbelieve that lavishing him with praise can lead to lavish rewards.Take the former South Dakota governor Kristi Noem, who in 2020presentedhim with a “bookshelf-sized” bronze model of Mount Rushmore, portraying Trump’s face next to those of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt. Noem isnow the secretary of homeland security. Stephen Miller,who called Trump“the most stylish president in our lifetime”, is the White House deputy chief of staff for policy.To some observers, this is just how Trump works, at home and abroad, and world leaders like Rutte who engage in flattery and “strategic self-emasculation” are just being smart. “A useful way to think about President Trump and his team is not in terms of a conventional American administration, but rather as a court,” saysSam Edwards, a reader in modern political history at Loughborough University. Understood in those terms, he argues, performative upsucking is all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I guess that’s the strategic calculation that Rutte has made. I might come in for criticism, but further down the line, do I get what I want? Yes.”That view is not universal, however. “Mr Rutte, he’s trying to embarrass you, sir,” Trump’s former director of communications Anthony Scaramuccisaid earlier this week. “He’s literally sitting on Air Force One laughing at you.”David H Dunn, a professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham, agrees that licking Trump’s boots doesn’t earn his favour but his disdain. His flattering cabinet were selected not because the president admires them, says Dunn, but because their obsequiousness shows their weakness.He thinks Rutte, too, has miscalculated. “There is a lot of evidence from the first term that Trump doesn’t necessarily respond to flattery,” Dunn says. “It sends a signal that this is not an alliance of equals. This is not the America of old, whereby there was a coming together of countries of shared values and shared interests.

Billionaires have also looked to useNew Zealand as a “bolthole”far away from the threat of societal turmoil.Most recently, the relaxing of rules for New Zealand’s so-called “golden visas” to attract wealthy investors has seena surge in applications from the US, including plenty – according to immigration consultants – driven by a desire to escape president Donald Trump’s administration.So what advice would recent US migrants offer to their compatriots? Some themes emerged: relish the free healthcare, embrace the work culture and natural beauty but brace for high living costs and feelings of isolation.View image in fullscreenNurse and life coach Sarah Parlow moved from Los Angeles to New Zealand in January to escape Trump’s America.Photograph: Sarah ParlowSarah Parlow did not arrive on a “golden visa” but deliberately moved to New Zealand a week before Trump’s inauguration in January.“When I saw the Republican party captured the House, the Senate and the presidency on election night, I just knew it would be disastrous for women’s rights, LGBT rights, and the American people in general,” Parlow says. “I just really wanted to be somewhere else for a while.”The Auckland-based nurse and life coach says it has been an easy landing. “It’s been a place where I feel I can recalibrate”.Stats NZ estimates 1,388 Americans migrated to New Zealand in the three months to the end of February, a jump of 1,127 on the same period a year earlier – 537 arrived in February alone, which is believed to be one of the highest monthly totals from the US on record.However, Amy Armstrong, who moved to New Zealand with her husband, Miles Nolte, and son Beck in 2022, has a warning. “You should feel pulled to be here,” she said, “not just pushed to get away from [the US].”View image in fullscreenAmericans Amy Armstrong, Miles Nolte and their son Beck moved to New Zealand in 2022, mostly driven by a thirst for adventure and love of the outdoors.Photograph: Amy Armstrong“I think it’s really easy coming from a place of feeling desperate in the United States right now, to assume that if you can get to New Zealand, it’s this golden parachute,” Nolte says, cautioning that not everything in New Zealand comes easy.The couple arrived in New Zealand after Armstrong was awarded an Edmund Hillary Fellowship and they have just gained residency. Their move was partly motivated by the US’s political climate but mostly driven by a thirst for adventure and love of the outdoors.In this respect, the country has been generous – the wild spaces are beautiful and accessible and there is a real sense of “community-mindedness”, Armstrong says.But there have been shocks. The housing can be cold and getting a job is often about who you know, as much as what you know.“The reality is, most people get jobs [here] based on knowing somebody,” says Nolte – an experienced writer, producer, hunter and fisher. “I have been a little shocked at how cloistered the market … and the connections have been.”For Wellington-based video editor Sam, who wished to use only his first name, the workplace culture was a surprising discovery – one he relishes for the lengthy holiday periods and better work-life balance but which also required steep learning curves.“In New Zealand, the relationships come first … if you’re in a position of leadership, you have to develop that relationship or it won’t work out,” says Sam.‘Hollowing out’: New Zealand grapples with an uncertain future as record numbers leaveRead moreSam and his wife moved to New Zealand in 2016 after falling in love with its natural beauty three years earlier. He is particularly struck by how access to free healthcare “gives you more freedom and latitude to try new things”.“That made me realise, as an American, how much of your life and the decisions you make are tied to your ability to get healthcare,” Sam said.Some Americans warned would-be migrants that the cost of living is high in New Zealand compared with the US, and said they had sometimes struggled to form friendships with locals. Meanwhile, the distance between New Zealand and the US can lead to loneliness.“Sometimes it can feel very isolating [if] you’re just here on your own and your family’s 3,000 miles away,” says Monique, who wished to give only her first name, and who moved to New Zealand in 2006.Yet, not one regretted their choice to move, nor had any pressing desire to return to the US.“I have a life here that I wouldn’t be able to have in California – I can afford to keep myself healthy [and] don’t have to pay for my prescriptions,” says Debbie, a retiree who has called New Zealand home since 2005. “New Zealand is a beautiful country and I am proud to be part of it.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The DJ, musician, model, podcaster, author and activist (to name just a few of their other job titles) is taking to the stage for the first of three Guardian Live Q&As this weekend, interviewed by journalist Zoe Williams. And don’t worry, all your important style conundrums are being answered: “Crocs, yes or no?”“Yeah!” Bimini enthuses. “They’re comfortable footwear at a festival.” It’s unclear whether they’ve packed any for later on, as they kick their heel into the air, revealing 16-in PVC stilettos. The 2025 festival style trend? “Skimpy,” they say, without missing a beat (they’re wearing a union jack corset and teensy leather hot pants).With the all-important fashion business out of the way, the conversation – dotted with questions from Guardian readers – covers anxiety, allyship and why policing body autonomy is “horrible”.Talk inevitably turns to the recenttrans bathroom ban. “Trans people just want to live their lives,” Bimini says, though they are hoping for more unity: “What needs to happen is more conversations where we come together and find a solution.” That includes “honest conversations with trans people, actually allowing trans people to speak about their existence,” they continue. “They’re mocked or ridiculed and I don’t think it’s a fair representation.”Right now, Bimini tells the crowd, we’re in a “hostile” place, “and we need to either get really angry and start a revolution or take acid and love each other”.“That’s what’s so beautiful about coming to Glastonbury. It feels like utopia, right? Although you probably couldn’t live here for ever because you’d be knackered.”They have memories of performing here in 2017, as part of the NYC Downlow’s drag coterie; it felt like a simpler time. “There was still a lot of hope and acceptance. Homophobia and transphobia wasn’t as high as it is now.” Even so, they add, Brexit was a catalyst for echo chambers. It “leads to ideas of, oh, there are other people that think like me, and then that slowly starts to build up, and we get to the place where we’re the most divided we’ve been in a long time”.View image in fullscreen‘I felt a lot of pressure’ … Bimini and Zoe Williams at Glastonbury.Photograph: Jonny WeeksBut back to Glastonbury. On a brighter note, they say, “I think this year is just about having fun, being radical with it, and standing up for what you believe.” And besides, adds Bimini, “I’ve always got something to say”.As Thomas George Graeme Hibbitts, growing up in Norfolk, they always had the acerbic, surreal sense of humour that they’re known for. “Bimini is just a bit more fun to look at.” They studied journalism, as well as international relations, at university, “so I was always quite into current affairs,” they explain. But drag allowed them to bring that on to the stage and “I was able to explore politicsandperform”.In response to a reader’s question about a recent social media post, in which they wrote about a time when they’d fallen out of love with performing, Bimini opened up about their mental health struggles in the aftermath of starring on season two of RuPaul’s Drag Race. “I felt a lot of pressure. There were a lot of different people around me telling me what I should do and how I should be.” They were thrust into “a different world that wouldn’t normally have accepted me. I got caught up and I became a bit depressed.”They’re also feeling weary about the politics side of things. “I’ve never understood how human rights is a discourse in itself,” they say. “Surely if there’s a war going on and people are trying to flee, we try to help them as much as we can.” Instead, they say, the UK government is doing the opposite: “It’s disgusting.” Bimini refuses to stop being outspoken about what they believe in. For a recent show, they were told to remove the line “Free Palestine” from one of their songs. In response, Bimini refused to let their song be used: “I’m not doing it.”Making and playing music, however, has revitalised them. “I’ve been making an electro-punk album,” they say, as well as officially remixing Anastacia’s 2000 smash I’m Outta Love and getting back into DJing (they’re playing two sets across Glasto weekend). Plus, we’ve nearly at the end of another Pride month. “This year is so important because we need to come together for the trans community. We need to come together for the migrants, disabled people, anyone that is a minority that doesn’t feel like they are being looked after.”As well as inclusivity, they urge collective action: “We need to fight.” They attended the recent lobby outside parliament to protest against the UK government’s bathroom ban. “What’s worrying is the policing of bathrooms. How do you police who’s going to the toilet? Is someone checking your genitals? I just think everyone needs to piss in peace.”Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalMusic festivalsTransgenderinterviewsShareReuse this content"

When the Guardian interviewed festival-goers queueing as the gates opened on Wednesday, several listed him as the artist they were most looking forward to seeing this year. The crowd he draws is vast: both a reminder of how successful his first two albums were – his debut was the bestselling UK album of 2019and2020 – and of the emotional charge that his appearance carries. He last played Glastonbury in 2023: it was supposed to be a return to live performances after he had to cancel a series of gigs amid struggles with his mental health and Tourette syndrome. Instead, his voice gave out, and Capaldi subsequently retreated from public view.He says he’s “easing into this” but, it has to be said, he looks noticeably less anxious two years on. There are no signs of the physical tics that beset him during the promotion of his second album, Broken By Desire to Be Heavenly Sent, and his voice is as roaring as it ever was. There’s definitely less of what Capaldi used to call “the blather” – the reliably hilarious and foul-mouthed between-song chat that frequently used to last longer than the actual songs – partly because of time constraints, and partly, he says, because he’s worried that he’s going to cry. When he does try to talk he’s frequently drowned out by the sound of the crowd singing his name to the tune of the White Stripes’ Seven Nation Army.View image in fullscreenDrowned out by the crowd … Capaldi at the Pyramid stage.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAFrom the opening notes of Before You Go, the crowd sing along to every song he plays, only ceasing when he performs a new song, Survive, that’s very clearly inspired by the events of the last two years: “I’m going to get up again, I’m going to get up and try if it’s the last thing I do.” It’s slow-paced, soaring-chorused business as usual, but whatever other advances have taken place in pop since Capaldi absented himself, the success of Alex Warren, Benson Boone et al. proves there’s still a substantial space for earnest, melancholy young men with acoustic guitars.He ends, inevitably, with Someone You Loved, which provokes a crowd sing-along that makes all the previous sing-alongs seem like rehearsals: as he predicted, Capaldi’s eyes start to brim. “Second time’s the charm, eh?” he nods: it would require a very hard heart indeed not to be moved yourself.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Lewis CapaldiFestivalsGlastonbury festivalMusic festivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s an intriguing beginning to the kind of Glastonbury set that captures an artist at what seems to be a tipping point of their career, that carries with it the distinct sense that they may be on the verge of becoming absolutely huge. The crowd she draws is vast and they respond to the handful of tracks already released from her forthcoming third album Euro-Country as if they’re her greatest hits. The celebrity-endorsed TikTok dance craze spawned by recent single Take a Sexy Picture of Me has clearly had some role to play in boosting her popularity – its arrival mid-set prompts a spontaneous crowd sing along; someone in the audience is so excited they let a smoke flare off midway through; the big screens reveal that even a security guard standing by the loos at the side of the stage is pumping his fist – but it can’t account for the rapturous reaction afforded her entire set.View image in fullscreenNext year’s headliner? … CMAT and her band.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAWhat does is that CMAT is a fantastic pop star. It’s not merely that she’ssmart, funny, gobbily outspoken, and looks fantastic – today she’s clad in huge earrings in the shape of the euro symboland blue plastic dress that she removes to reveal a matching blue leotard, while mocking the fat-shaming comments posted about her on social media. It’s not just that she is blessed with both a potent, octave-leaping voice and a surfeit of superb, hook-laden songs that split the difference between country mid-70s Fleetwood Mac and come equipped with sharp, witty lyrics. It’s that she’s a quite spectacularly brilliant live performer. She alternates between stage moves that very much hail from the Dance Like No One’s Watching school of abandon, and choreographed routines with her band members: at the climax of one, she rips off her male band members’ skirts in a manner reminiscent of Bucks Fizz’s famous Eurovision moment. She announces herself as possessed of “middle child syndrome, an amazing arse and the best Irish country rock’n’roll band in the world” and beckons for applause whenever she mentions her own name – when the crowd start chanting her name of their own accord, she responds by bending over and wiggling her bum at them. When she successfully encourages the audience to engage in synchronised dance moves to I Wanna Be a Cowboy, Baby!, she looks quite startled at what a crowd this size enthusiastically dancing in unison looks like.It’s all incredibly engaging and preposterously good fun, and it reaches a climax with Stay for Something She runs to the barrier at the front stage, climbs on top of it, hugs a fan, strikes a series of coquettish poses, then – to the visible horror of the security guard accompanying her – motions for the crowd to part, runs into their centre and delivers the final chorus in the middle of the audience. Back on stage, she leads a chant of “free Palestine” and she’s gone – it really doesn’t seem inconceivable that she could be headlining the next time she returns.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury festivalGlastonbury 2025FestivalsMusic festivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The radial-cut sail allows greater distribution of tension, which makes it strong, durable and wind resistant.What you need to knowHow to choose the best parasol or shade for your gardenThe right sunshade or parasol will depend on your space, budget and how you plan to use the area. It’s worth noting that many designs, especially more traditional-style umbrellas, don’t come with a base as standard, so you may need to buy one separately.Cantilever parasolsoffer excellent versatility and are ideal for larger spaces, such as patios, poolside areas or outdoor dining spots, where you want unobstructed room beneath the canopy. They can swivel, tilt and rotate, allowing for flexible shade coverage as the sun moves throughout the day. However, they’re more expensive and require a heavy base, which can make them bulky and less portable.Tilting parasolscan be more affordable and work well in medium-sized spaces, such as patios, seating areas and on decks. It’s useful to be able to adjust the angles to block the sun from different directions, although the central pole can sometimes limit space directly beneath. They’re also less stable in strong winds.Upright parasolsare the most basic and cost-effective option, best suited for small patios, balconies and portable setups such as picnics. They’re easy to store and set up, but lack the flexibility of a tilt or rotation function, offering limited directional shade. They also tend to be less stable in windy conditions, unless well anchored.Sail shadesprovide a sleek, architectural look and can cover large areas such as decks, playgrounds and patios without obstructing the space below. They’re often more wind-resistant, but they need mounting points and are fixed in place, which means they don’t adjust with the sun’s movement, so correct placement is important.How to clean your parasol or sailIf you want your parasol or shade to last, proper cleaning and maintenance are essential. Cantilever, tilting and upright parasols should all be cleaned by removing loose debris with a soft brush, then wiping the canopy with a mixture of mild soap and water. Rinse thoroughly and allow to air dry. Check any moving parts and joints regularly, tighten any loose screws and lubricate, if necessary, withan all-purpose product such as WD40to keep mechanisms smooth.Always close and cover a parasol or umbrella, especially during windy or rainy weather, and store indoors – or use a cover when not in use for any length of time. To deep clean a sail shade, lay it flat and use a mild detergent with a soft brush to remove any dirt. Rinse well and let dry completely before reinstalling. Check attachment points and tension regularly, tightening as needed to prevent sagging.Claudia Baillie is a journalist specialising in design and interiors.

One paper has likened smartphones to a“parasite” on our brains, while another study suggestsmoderate use of social media does not have a harmful effecton young people. In the US more than 100,000 parents havejoined an online pledgeto delay giving children smartphones until at least the eighth grade and in Australia a ban on under-16s using social media will come into effect in December. Despite all this, OECD figuresreleased in Mayshow 70% of 10-year-olds and 98% of 15-year-olds have internet-connected smartphones.So is giving teenagers smartphones that big a deal?To find out, we asked four twentysomethings who got a smartphone at some point in their teen or preteen years – and one who didn’t.‘I would have not let myself ever get TikTok’Sienna Seychell, 21,MelbourneI was about 11 when I got my first smartphone. But when I was six I got an iPod Touch so I had already been communicating with people that way. My brother installed Kik, the infamous app for predators, on the iPod – a bit concerning to think about now! But I just used it to text my friends from school. I know a fair few of my friends went down a rabbit hole contacting people that they definitely shouldn’t have at that age.I’m an expert on adolescence: here’s why a smartphone ban isn’t the answer, and what we should do insteadRead moreI got social media in year 5 or 6. I convinced my mum to let me get Snapchat for the filters and I got Instagram shortly after. It definitely brought my friendships closer because I had a readily accessible means of communication outside school hours. I was cyberbullied in year 6, so that was a negative. But I feel like I put that aside to be able to talk with friends. I had a good experience of social media overall but it has contributed to friends’ severe eating disorders.View image in fullscreen“[Social media] definitely brought my friendships closer because I had a readily accessible means of communication outside school hours,” says Sienna Seychell.Photograph: Sean DaveyI think I would have been more outdoorsy had I not had a phone. I would have connected with nature more and hung out in the real world, instead of online all the time. I think it would have made a great impact on my mental health. I suffer from pretty bad anxiety and OCD and sometimes I feel that a big trigger is using my phone and being able to focus on things online that are outside my control. I would have hated a social media ban – but I would have gotten over it!If I could go back I would have not let myself ever get TikTok. I think my attention span is so poor because of it and I really struggle to sit down and study or just do what I love doing without getting distracted. I can barely watch a movie for an hour without checking my phone a few times. I’m always on my phone.‘I felt like everybody was judging each other’Ella Jackson, 21,regional New South WalesI was 12 when Mum took me to get an iPhone 5, so I had Instagram from a really young age. I grew up in a place called Penrose, which is in the NSW southern highlands. I liked emo music so I would spend a lot of time on my phone looking into that world. I found a sense of belonging on the internet, because there weren’t a lot of people around who liked the same things as me.The bad side of it was Instagram models, obviously. Twelve-year-old girls shouldn’t be comparing themselves to 30-year-old women. I think I also became conscious of the fact that it seemed like a big deal to live a life that was “worth” posting on Instagram, especially in the later part of high school. It made me conscious of how people perceive others. I felt like everybody was judging each other all the time.Studying I found so tricky, because the phone was always there and it was so easy to be distracted by it. I ended up having to film myself studying so I couldn’t go on my phone. And because my mum’s house was in a regional part of the highlands, there was no way out unless she was going to drive me 40 minutes into town. So I was just stuck at home all weekend and would just sit there streaming, which is crazy. It’s this huge amount of time that was not well spent.When I got my driver’s licence, all of this changed. I could go places and see my friends. More interesting things came along and my brain was like, OK, you don’t need to be doing this any more.‘It trained me to expect immediate contact’Zach Karpinellison, 29, SydneyI had a dumb phone until I was probably 15, then I pivoted to a cheap Android. On my dumb phone I had limited data and credit. So the clear difference was that, all of a sudden, you’re constantly messaging other people. I was in an era where schools had no sense of whether phones needed to be regulated, so you had your phone on you all the time. It was a real opportunity to have quite deep conversations with people, which would do a lot of the work of forming a friendship with them. It was also an opportunity to connect to a wider pool of people outside school. That was good – I liked that part of it.But it trained me to expect immediate contact with everybody. I would feel a real panic and stress over not hearing back from people if they didn’t immediately write back. I carry that with me to this day – being stressed about someone not responding to me. As a teenager, you’re already full of anxiety and trying to figure out the world. Then you’re messaging someone at 2am and they drop off, and you spiral out into “something terrible has happened!” I don’t think my brain should have gone through that at that stage.I had Facebook and Messenger, then Instagram towards the end of high school. Because I went through those different iterations of the internet, I am savvy about how to use these things but also have an ability to step away from it. I recognise when I’m being sold things in a way that people who are gen Z don’t necessarily.But we were posting ourselves online and comparing the like counts [of Instagram posts]. That was, like, absolutely brain melting. It was not good.‘I didn’t get a proper phone until I was 20’Pearl Cardis, 24,SydneyI had a Nokia brick phone in school. It was the equivalent of a party trick because I could toss it across the playground, or break in three pieces for the drama, and then put it back together – people’s eyes got so wide. But beyond that it was pretty rough.I’m a very different person to what the mould looks like for the people I grew up withPearl CardisWe were quite low-income. Mum had all of us on Vodafone so that we could do free Vodafone-to-Vodafone calls but we weren’t able to text anyone. So I could only really use my phone to call family. All around me it was Apple city – everyone else had an iPhone. I was not overly concerned with fitting in but I also didn’t have great friendships. I doubt being different in that way helps when you’re already kind of an oddball.For me the dominant experience was one of stress and isolation because I had less independence and less ability to connect with people around me. It was difficult to travel anywhere or meet anyone because I couldn’t use maps or text friends. I remember getting off the bus one time and just being so panicked, in the middle of nowhere, with no way to contact anyone except an actual pay phone on the side of the road. I tried to call someone but they didn’t pick up.View image in fullscreenPearl Cardis, 24, sends a friend a selfie. Her first phone didn’t have a camera.Photograph: Remi Chauvin/The GuardianI know that a lot of people had huge body image issues going through high school or were very concerned with trends and appearance – whereas I was just not conscious of that. I still had low self-esteem, which I think any young person will, but it was more through comparison to my peers than anyone online.Let’s teach teenagers how to use smartphones responsibly | LettersRead moreI didn’t get a proper phone until I was 20. I think I’m a very different person to what the mould looks like for the people I grew up with. I am able to go without my phone for an extremely long time without worrying about it. I feel less habituated to needing to check notifications all the time, and I hate [the pressure to] respond to people regularly.But when TikTok came out there were periods where I would be trapped for five hours at a time scrolling. I just get so sucked in because I have no guardrails. It’s like a kid who doesn’t have sugar who gets access to sugar. Maybe these are things that it’s better to be trained to adapt to as you grow up, as opposed to the floodgates opening all in one go.View image in fullscreenPearl Cardisuses her smart phone sparingly, and is often not even quite sure where it is.Photograph: Remi Chauvin/The Guardian‘I would wake up and get straight on my phone’Reinhard Holl, 24, AdelaideI got an iPhone in year 7. I came to social media a little bit later, maybe midway through high school – it didn’t spark my interest that much at first. Later it became more of a fixation. I would say social media became a little bit of a negative thing in the way that I felt a lot of pressure to be perceived a certain way, put things online and keep up with the way that everybody else was using it in high school. But it also became a good way to interact with people.The phone definitely affected my sleep. I would wake up and get straight on my phone and mentally reinforce having that immediate stimulus as a normal thing. I think it affected my attention span, too – it was this thing that I was focused on constantly.If I could go back I wouldn’t have allowed myself to sleep with it in my room. But really, I feel like I got thrown in the deep end and learned how to have a phone that way. I now have a good dynamic with it – I know how to use it in a way that works well for me.Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleChildrenSmartphonesSocial mediaMobile phonesParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The uberviolentSouth Korean juggernaut– still Netflix’s most popular show ever – reaches the end point … and Player 456 is still in the game. What will happen after the armed rebellion? Will he figure out he’s playing alongside Frontman? And will he make it out alive? The show’s creator Hwang Dong-hyuk opened up about the denouement this week, telling fans it’s bleaker than ever. Apparently after watching, we’ll be left shaking and asking ourselves: “How much humanity do I have left in me?” One thing’s for sure: there’ll be no let-up. Expect gore galore.Out now, NetflixToo MuchView image in fullscreenEver-excellent … Meg Stalter in Too Much.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/NetflixThe oneLena Dunhamfans have been waitin​g for. ​E​ight years after the end ofGirls, she makes a welcome return to television. The ever-excellent Megan ​Stalter – AKA the hilariously ditzy agent Kayla inHacks– plays Jess, an American ad executive ​who is obsessed with classic British love stories. When her deadbeat boyfriend leaves her for an influencer who makes lipgloss​ – “no one is fucking an influencer in the works of Jane Austen!” – she decides to take her broken heart to London in “the Kingdom of ​United” and start over. ​When she arrives, she’s devastated to discover that her ​new “estate” isn’t ​quite the verdant paradise she dreamed it would be. ​Promptly​, of course​, Jess meets her ​very own Mr Darcy – indie rocker Felix.10 July, NetflixThe InstituteView image in fullscreenGifted … Joe Freeman as Luke Ellis in The Institute.Photograph: Chris Reardon/MGM+A teenager is panicked to find himself waking up in a mysterious institution full of youngsters who possess special abilities, and he has every reason to be scared – he’s in a Stephen King adaptation. Given that the author was one of the inspirations for Stranger Things, and this tale of a totalitarian bootcamp for telekinetic children feels as though it’s drawing on Eleven’s backstory, it has the sense of the author coming full circle. But if this stays true to his 2019 novel, we are in for plenty of creeping dread and commentary on Trump’s America.13 July, Prime VideoMix TapeView image in fullscreenGorgeous … Florence Hunt and Rory Walton-Smith in Mix Tape.Photograph: Cait FahyA gorgeous will-they-won’t-they romance that spans decades. Daniel is a music journo who has harboured a secret lifelong devotion to his first love Alison, who mysteriously disappeared from their home town Sheffield when they were teens. Decades later, they find each other online and, though they’re both married, start sending each other tunes from their youth. The stars – Jim Sturgess and Rory Walton-Smith as older and younger Daniel, and Teresa Palmer and Florence Hunt as older and younger Alison – are wonderful across the board, and the soundtrack is stuffed with 80s bangers from New Order to the Cure. It’s a yearning look at what it’s like to marry the wrong person – and why first love might be right all along.15 July, BBC TwoBookishView image in fullscreenCrime-solving has never been more fun … (from left) Buket Komur as Nora, Mark Gatiss as Gabriel Book and Connor Finch as Jack in Bookish.Photograph: Nicolas Velter/UKTVSuch is the prevalence of cosy crime – and the star wattage of ​Mark ​Gatiss – that this ​postwar comedy-drama has been recommissioned before the first season has even started. ​G​atiss stars as ​Gabriel Book, owner of Book’s books​hop​, a kooky gent with a passion for puzzles –​ what else! – who helps the police solve ​murder cases​.​ But the plot thickens when he gives mysterious ex-con Jack a job in the shop and lets him move into their attic (“He’s like Mrs Rochester – only slightly more butch!”).

Should be lots of tense, action-packed fun.July, Prime VideoDestination XBereft fans who are desperately missing Race Across the World and those who are giddy with anticipation forThe Celebrity Traitorsin autumn – ie, all of us – should look no further than Destination X. This wild adventure gameshow overseen byRob Brydontakes contestants, lumps them in a “blacked-out” bus and drives them to a mystery location somewhere in Europe.

If its claim that it will provide a totally new perspective on what makes us human is to be believed, this will be a gamechanger.July, BBC OneUnforgivableFrom Cracker to Time, a Jimmy McGovern show is always a must-watch – even one as harrowing as this. Anna Friel stars as Anna, whose brother Joe (a truly devastating Bobby Schofield) sexually assaulted his young nephew Tom a few years ago. As we meet Joe, he is leaving prison a shell of a man and goes to stay at a halfway house run by Sister Katherine, played by Anna Maxwell Martin, for therapy and horrifying realisations about the abuse he himself has faced. A brutal look at a family torn asunder.July, BBC OnePlatonicView image in fullscreenIncredible chemistry … Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen in Platonic.Photograph: Paul Sarkis/APThis super funbuddy-comedystarring Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne and their incredible chemistry has flown under the radar but it’s well worth catching up ahead of its second outing.

When a space ship crash lands, the contents turn out to not exactly delight people who like to go through life without an alien clasped to their face.

We also see him as an older surgeon (played by Ciarán Hinds) still haunted by the hell of his capture and the love of Amy.

There has beendebateabout whether this is true; nevertheless, Google searches for the term soared.“Let’s be honest – if someone looks incredible for their age, they’ve likely had a facelift,” says Dr Anand Sanan, a double board-certified facial plastic surgeon. “The truth is, there’s no green juice, workout regimen or amount of Botox and filler that can replicate the results of deep plane surgery,” Sanan says.Here’s what to know about the deep plane facelift.What is a facelift?The goal of any facelift – also known as a rhytidectomy – is to “lift and reposition the skin, soft tissue, fat pads and muscle layers that naturally descend over time due to gravity and ageing”, says Sanan.Specifically, it targets signs of ageing in the mid-face, jawline and neck, explains Dr Patrick J Byrne, facial plastic surgeon, president of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (AAFPRS) and chair of the Cleveland Clinic’s Head & Neck Institute.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Facelifts are one of the mostpopularcosmeticproceduresin the US. According to a 2024 memberssurveyfrom the AAFPRS, the procedure is one of the three most common top facial surgery procedures, and nearly 90% of the group’s members perform them each year. The survey also noted that facelift patients are “trending younger” – roughly 32% of facelifts are performed on those ages 33-55, up from 26%.Facelifts are also becoming more common in the UK. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeonsreportedan 8% increase in the number of face and neck lifts performed in 2024, partly due to a 26% increase in the number of the procedures performed on men.How is a deep plane facelift different from a traditional one?A deep plane facelift works with deeper layers of tissue than a typical facelift, also known as a superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) facelift. The SMAS is a thin, fibrous layer that divides the face’s deep and superficial layers of adipose tissue (or fat cells).“With a traditional SMAS facelift, the skin is lifted away from the underlying SMAS layer and tightened separately from it,” explainsDr Justin Cohen, a double board-certified facial plastic surgeon. This technique is “relatively easy to perform, and remains one of the most commonly used by surgeons today”, he says.By contrast, a deep plane facelift works beneath the SMAS layer, says Sanan. During a deep plane facelift, a surgeon releases the facial ligaments that “tether the face and neck down”. Releasing these ligaments allows the surgeon to “lift the entire facial soft tissue layer as a single unit,” he says.“The technique avoids the overly tight or ‘pulled’ look sometimes seen with more traditional techniques,” says Cohen.Because they work with a deeper layer of tissue, deep plane facelifts tend to last longer.“The face will continue to age following surgery,” says Cohen, and the longevity of the results depends on a number of factors including the patient’s genetics, lifestyle and skincare regimen. Generally, though, results can be seen for 10-15 years following surgery, as opposed toup to 10 yearsfor regular facelifts.As it is a more complex procedure, the deep plane facelift often costs more than an SMAS facelift, says Cohen. TheAmerican Society of Plastic Surgeonsputs the average cost of a facelift in the US at about $11,395. A deep plane facelift, meanwhile, can set you back between $30,000 and $100,000, says Cohen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These include hematomas (a collection of blood inside a closed wound), infection, nerve injury, a prolonged healing process, and facial asymmetries or irregularities.“In experienced hands, these risks are low but should be part of an informed discussion,” says Byrne.For people interested in a facelift, experts repeatedly emphasized how important it is to choose a skilled surgeon, especially when it comes to an advanced procedure like the deep plane facelift.My father had plastic surgery. Now he wants me and my mother to get work doneRead more“Unfortunately, with the growing popularity of the term ‘deep plane’ as a marketing buzzword, there are surgeons advertising deep plane procedures” when that’s not what they’re doing, says Cohen.Experts recommend working specifically with a facial plastic surgeon – “someone who has dedicated their entire career to mastering facial anatomy, harmony and ageing”, says Sanan.Additionally, just because a deep plane facelift is the buzzy proceduredu jourdoesn’t mean you need one. Even if you are interested in cosmetic surgery, it might not be the procedure for you.“No single technique is right for everyone,” says Cohen.And if it’s not for you, just think of all the other things you could spend that money on – like arare Beanie Baby, or several diamond crystalbathtubs for your dogs.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyPlastic surgeryBeautyWomen (Life and style)MenWomen (Society)featuresShareReuse this content"

What makes directing a job for life?Fri 27 Jun 2025 10.17 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 10.34 EDTShareIf life behaved in the same way as movies, thenThe Fabelmanswould have been Steven Spielberg’s last film. He spent the previous five decades writing the rulebook of modern cinema, and then The Fabelmans was the rare work of art that wrapped everything up with a neat little bow. Part autobiography and part tutorial, it was like the work of a man looking back on his life with a sense of satisfied completion.But real life doesn’t behave like that, and Spielberg has just announced that he is never going to retire. In fact, he announced it twice. In a speech he gave during a star-studded event unveiling a newSteven SpielbergTheater on the Universal lot last night, the 78-year-old said: “I’m making a lot of movies and I have no plans … ever … to retire.” And then, talking to the Hollywood Reporter afterwards, he added that he has “an appetite for a western which I will someday hopefully do. It’s something that’s eluded me for all of these decades.”If you have been keeping track of Spielberg’s movements, this will not come as a surprise. Next year should see the release of an as yet untitled sci-fi film starring Emily Blunt and Josh O’Connor, which means The Fabelmans will not even be close to being his final work. And that is undoubtedly a good thing, since if a talent like Spielberg still has the passion and ability to keep making films, the world will be richer for it.And he isn’t alone in his desire never to stop working. Last month,Tom Cruise declared his intentionto still be making films when he’s 100. Again, this is great – maybe he and Spielberg will even team up and do a Minority Report sequel a decade from now – but it is slightly unusual for them to say it out loud.View image in fullscreenMaybe we’ll get a Minority Report 2? Tom Cruise and Spielberg at the Oscars in 2023.Photograph: Dana Pleasant/Newspix InternationalBecause the expectation is that film-makers won’t retire. Martin Scorsese is 82 and shows no signs of stopping. So is Werner Herzog, and his next improbably titled film, Bucking Fastard, is in post-production. Francis Ford Coppola istouring Megalopolisat the age of 86. And Ridley Scott, 87, has four films in various stages of production including a sci-fi, a western and a Bee Gees biopic. When David Lynch died this year, aged 78, he wasstill tryingto get his Netflix series Unrecorded Night off the ground. If you make films for a living, then everyone wants you to do it until you drop.This is for a couple of reasons. With age comes wisdom and confidence and perspective, which makes for richer storytelling. Scorsese claims that his film Silence took 30 years to make, for instance, because he was waiting to amass the right amount of experience to give it the proper respect. And The Fabelmans would have been wildly different if Spielberg had made it in his 50s, 40s or 30s.Furthermore, making a film is a battle. The time between concept and completion is measured in years. The process is such a slog that, when a film-maker dies, the likelihood is that several unrealised movies die with them. Wouldn’t you keep going to the bitter end if you were in their shoes?View image in fullscreenHow many more? … Quentin Tarantino.Photograph: Valéry Hache/AFP/Getty ImagesIn fact, the expectation to continue no matter what is so ingrained that people struggle with the thought of a film-maker retiring. In every interviewQuentin Tarantinohas given for the last decade, he has been asked about his decision to walk away after his next film. And Tarantino is 62. By the time what he says will be his final film comes out, he’ll be pushing 70. In any other industry, that would be prime retirement age. He’d release it, give his last interview, then spend the rest of his life watching daytime TV in his favourite slippers. Yet, because he makes films, people are baffled by the idea of him stopping.Such is the life of a director. Unless you are a Tarantino-style outlier, retirement isn’t an option. You are destined to keep going, until either you die or the entire film industry dies around you. And really, at this point, it’s a coin toss.Explore more on these topicsFilmSteven SpielbergMartin ScorseseFrancis Ford  CoppolaWerner HerzogQuentin TarantinocommentShareReuse this content"

Sinner held three championship points for what would be one of the most monumental victories of his career.Just one of those three would have earned him a first grand slam title away from hard courts and redefined the terms of engagement with Alcaraz, the only player to beat him for 10 months. Sinner would then have drawn level with the Spaniard on four grand slam titles.What to watch out for at Wimbledon 2025: no line judges and more expensive strawberriesRead moreThe margins that determine success have always been precarious but few occasions exemplified this like Paris. Instead of Sinner reinforcing his status as the world’s best, Alcaraz produced another legendary moment in his young career withone of the greatest comebacks of all time. Although the Italian remains No 1 and the best player in the world based on his performances over the past year, on the eve of Wimbledon Alcaraz is the player to beat.Since Roland Garros, the momentum and good vibes surrounding the champion have only increased. He followed his three-day interlude in Ibiza bywinning at Queen’s Clubfor a second time. While he still considers clay his favourite surface, the 22-year-old’s grass record is astounding. He has amassed 29 wins and three defeats, winning 25 of his past 26 matches on the surface. He has more grass-court titles – four – than losses. He heads into Wimbledon as the clear favourite and will attempt to become the fifth man in the Open erato win the singles titlethree times in a row.It will take time for Sinner, who is nine months older, to come to terms with the French Open defeat, which was still playing on his mind when he lost in the second round of the Halle Open last week to Alexander Bublik. But another grand slam tournament also provides him with an opportunity to forge ahead with fresh motivation. Alcaraz and Sinner haveshared the past six grand slam titles, shutting out the rest of the field and until there is a significant shift, it is difficult to choose the rest of the field over these two players.Novak Djokovic, however, continues to relish the challenge of trying to disrupt the youngsters. At the age of 38 he has clearly been third-best player at the grand slams this year, reaching two semi-finals, with victories over Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev. On grass, where the seven-timeWimbledonchampion’s understanding of the surface is second to none and the faster conditions are more helpful to his ageing body, Wimbledon has always represented his biggest opportunity of becoming the oldest slam champion in the Open era.It is clear that Jack Draper will command the most attention at the beginning. The Briton’s past year has been remarkable, with the 23-year-old rising from No 40 to No 4,winning his first Masters 1000 titleat Indian Wells and reaching his first slam semi-final at the US Open. Draper has everything he could possibly want to make a deep run on the grass – a well-rounded, increasingly complete game and his destructive lefty serve and forehand are well-suited to the fast surface.View image in fullscreenJack Draper will command the majority of attention at the beginning of the tournament.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersWhile most British players have some sort of early breakthrough at Wimbledon, Draper, at 23, has never passed the second round and his success has come on foreign shores. He has never experienced the pressure and attention that comes with being a top home player and genuine contender on Centre Court. In the long run, Draper has the character and single-minded focus to handle these situations and produce his best tennis but the coming week will be a fascinating test of his character and current readiness for these moments.The women’s draw is shrouded in even more uncertainty. Aryna Sabalenka has clearly established herself as the top player but, like Sinner, she arrives at Wimbledon with her ego bruised after her dramaticthree-set defeat to Coco Gauffin the French Open final.Her tactless comments after the defeat, and the backlash they generated, only made things even more difficult for her. The Belarusian remains the favourite to win a first Wimbledon title, where the grass aids her ultra-offensive shotmaking.‘It helped me be free’: Madison Keys on therapy, Donald Trump and her husband as coachRead moreBeyond Sabalenka, there is even less clarity. Gauff has solidified herself as a true championship player by winning her second slam in Paris. However, despite her breakthrough run coming at Wimbledon, when she reached the fourth round from qualifying on her slam debut as a 15-year-old, the American, now 21, has struggled to find her best on grass.Iga Swiatek’s difficulties on grass are similarly well established but, with every year, the former world No 1 does appear to grow more comfortable. After an extremely difficult period on court this year, she did leave Roland Garros with her head held high despite her dominance in Paris coming to an end after her semi-final loss to Sabalenka.As is often the case, contenders could come from anywhere. Five months on from her stunning triumph at the Australian Open, Madison Keys remains effective both on grass and at slams. Mirra Andreeva’s improved serve should make her even more dangerous this year.In a sport where the margins are so tight, and there are so many players capable of performing at a high level on their day, this Wimbledon may well be decided by whoever truly rises to the occasion when they most need to.Explore more on these topicsWimbledonCarlos AlcarazJannik SinnerAryna SabalenkaIga SwiatekTennisWimbledon 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

I’ve got a lot of belief with this team. They’re so exciting to watch. They play without any inhibitions.

Whether that can translate to England’s senior side remains the big question after his six-match spell as interim manager. The Football Association has signed him up to take charge of the next under-21s tournament, in Albania and Serbia in 2027.Most of this squad will not be eligible, but Carsley knows that another European title would do his prospects no harm, havingmade clear his ambitionto one day take the senior job again. Thomas Tuchel, the incumbent, and his Germany counterpart and compatriot, Julian Nagelsmann, who is interrupting his holiday in Mallorca to attend, will be part of a sold-out crowd in Bratislava for Saturday’s final.An awkward moment was skilfully manoeuvred by Carsley when a Slovakian journalist asked which team Tuchel would be supporting. “Well, I imagine he will support England with him being the England head coach,” he responded.England’s captain, James McAtee, who is expected to leave Manchester City this summer, acknowledged it will be big chance for the players to shine. “I think it will be extra motivation for the lads to win,” said McAtee, who was gushing when asked about Carsley’s influence. “I think the biggest thing about working with Lee is the belief and the trust that he puts in you. On the pitch he just fills you with confidence. You know that you can go and play with freedom.”England’s players have been allowed to explore the Slovakian capital during their free time this week and Carsley will hope they have recovered sufficiently from five games in the past fortnight. It will be the third time England have faced German opposition in the final of theEuropean Under-21 Championship, having beaten West Germany to win their first title in 1982 under Dave Sexton, who won it again two years later, then been thumped 4-0 in 2009 under Stuart Pearce by a team featuring Manuel Neuer, Mats Hummels, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is currently third.Wolff was openin his previous pursuit of Verstappenuntil the middle of last season when the Dutch driver committed to staying at Red Bull and Mercedes signed Kimi Antonelli on a multiyear deal. In Austria, Wolff insisted he did not want to hide any negotiations from his drivers.“What we are trying to do in the team is be transparent,” he said. “You can choose to hold things under wraps, or do what we’ve done in the last 20 years I’ve been here is putting it out there and saying this is the situation. These drivers are clever people and they talk to each other.“I’m saying it how it is and there’s no such thing as saying we are going to sign Max, because it’s so far away that it’s not realistic at that stage. So with George, we talk about everything.”Verstappen did not deny talks were taking place when asked. “I don’t think we need to talk about that,” he said. “I don’t know, do you want me to repeat what I said last year? I don’t know. It’s the same answer.”Last year when faced with the same questions at this race, Verstappen emphatically confirmed he would remain at Red Bull.His team have brought upgrades to the Red Bull Ring, hopeful they might improve his fortunes, but it was Russell who was quickest in first practice in Spielberg, while McLaren’sLando Norris, also boasting upgrades, topped the time sheets in the second session in what is something of a big weekend for the British driver.View image in fullscreenLando Norris topped the time sheets in the second session.Photograph: Gintare Karpaviciute/ReutersIntensely self-critical, Norris will have subjected himselfto no little soul-searchingin the two weeks since he climbed disconsolately from his stricken car at the Canadian Grand Prix after hitting his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He held his hands up immediately, his contrition clear even, asMcLarenhad already all but acknowledged it was a matter of when not if the two finally came together, given the team’s stance on allowing their drivers to race one another. Yet for McLaren there has been no panic and certainly no sudden imposition of restrictions curtailing their drivers’ freedom to compete. Having dealt with it, it is business as usual.For Norris, however, it represents a bruising reminder of quite what is at stake and the intensifying pressure on him to deliver if he is to retain his world championship ambitions.With 10 races gone he trails Piastri by 22 points and while it is far from an insurmountable gap with 14 meetings to go, of more concern is that the form is overwhelmingly with the Australian. Norris had begun as favourite and had taken victoryin the season openerin Australia, where Piastri made his only major mistake thus far, spinning off in sudden, treacherous rain in Melbourne. Since when and until Canada, the Australian enjoyed a run of eight consecutive top-three finishes including five wins.Norris’s performances in contrast have been peppered with minor errors and some more costly, including Canada and crashing out of qualifying in Saudi Arabia.“Lando himself will have to show his character to overcome this kind of episode,” said the team principal, Andrea Stella, and Austria is a chance for Norris to reset and reassert at a key moment for the 25-year-old.Explore more on these topicsMercedes GPMax VerstappenFormula OneMotor sportMcLarenLando NorrisRed BullnewsShareReuse this content"

It is not difficult to draw a line under it. The tour starts when boots are on the ground in Australia and listening to the noises coming out of the camp, I’d be amazed if Andy Farrell is voicing the same frustrations after Saturday’s match against Western Force.The handling errorsagainst the Pumasstood out. I don’t mind so much those that were committed in aerial contests – though there were a lot in open play as well – but I think what really frustrated Farrell is that Argentina appeared to be playing with more urgency at the breakdown and when it came to feeding off the loose scraps.The first match is always difficult. There is so much goodwill, so much energy behind the first Lions game of a tour that it can be hard not to force things, not to get carried away with a determination to impress. Bear in mind that Argentina are ranked fifth in the world and the Lions will not face another challenge like the Pumas until we get into the Test series.View image in fullscreenThe Lions need to demonstrate better decision-making and accuracy than they showed in defeat against Argentina.Photograph: David Gibson/Fotosport/ShutterstockClearly there was a desire to move the ball and keep it alive – and I always say that what we see on the pitch is a reflection of what has been worked on in training – but some of the decision-making let the Lions down. Whether it be a two-on-one on the edge that Marcus Smith ought to have spotted, or Duhan van der Merwe’s failure to pass inside to Alex Mitchell. The expectation on Saturday is that the Lions demonstrate better decision-making and better accuracy, all underpinned by improvements according to Farrell’s frustrations – namely hunger, desire and energy.I’m encouraged bythe team that Farrell has selectedand while I don’t think it will be the Test team, I would have no problem with this XV lining up against the Wallabies. I like the blend of the backline, with pace, creativity and power and the fact that there is plenty of familiarity given the number of Leinster and Ireland players selected can only be a good thing.View image in fullscreenHenry Pollock has a big opportunity to make an impact against Western Force.Photograph: Dan Sheridan/Inpho/ShutterstockLast week there were certain similarities in what the Lions were trying to achieve in attack with how Farrell’s Ireland go about things and that makes obvious sense. I would say that Ireland have the best attacking framework and structure of the four home nations so it stands to reason. When I talk about structure it can sound like a negative thing, like it can be constraining, but that doesn’t have to be the case.Excuse the analogy but when I was doing Strictly Come Dancing, I thought that ballroom dancing would be really quite boring because it was all about “the frame”. What I soon realised is once you’ve got the frame built and set, it effectively just becomes a pillar in the foundation. What you do within that frame – shoulders back, traps down, elbows high, fingers pointing, neck long, chin to 45 degrees – once you’ve got those principles in place, you can do whatever you want. So when it comes to the Lions’ attacking structure, it looked similar to that of Ireland but that doesn’t mean there is no room for players to act on instinct. A good example was Mitchell’s pass out the back when recovering near his own line and I’d have liked to see a bit more of it. I was a bit surprised there was no attempt to tap and go, to up the tempo that little bit more.At this stage it is too early to read too much into combinations and what implications they might have for the Test team. It will only become apparent by the third match of the tour in Australia. Maro Itoje isn’t playing Saturday but that’s likely because Farrell wants to see him lining up alongside another second row and the time is not yet right for that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are the worst-ranked Australian team in Super Rugby whereas the Lions are now fully stacked, barring the odd injury niggle and Farrell will want them to go out and deliver a statement. The noise has already started coming from one or two former Australia players, claiming even that the Wallabies will whitewash the Lions.I love it when the noise starts but that is quite simply an incredible claim. I don’t mean to get all Chris Whitty, but we have to follow the evidence and it simply doesn’t exist to suggest the Lions will be whitewashed. Bold statements like that do, however, signal that the tour is up and running.Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsLions tour 2025Australia sportRugby unioncommentShareReuse this content"

After two days of wobbles, a portion of Australia’s batting got its act together, with the lower-middle-order trio of Travis Head, Beau Webster, and Alex Carey making half centuries to lift Australia’s second innings to 310. That left West Indies needing 301 to win the first Test in Barbados, always unlikely on a Kensington Oval pitch that already had balls keeping low. Josh Hazlewood made sure of it with a withering burst of 4-4 in 16 balls, later upping that to 5-23, as West Indies crashed humiliatingly to 141 all out, losing by 159 runs.Hazlewood has been the subject of some public attention of late, given his injury absences and how well Scott Boland has performed during each one. But the first-choice option has 288 Test wickets, took 35 of them at 13 last calendar year, and has nine at 18 in the two matches he has managed in 2025. His career against West Indies is worth 43 at 15, and over two tours to this part of the world he has 19 wickets at nine.Usman Khawaja refuses SEN interview after radio station’s sacking of journalistRead moreHis match-defining spell was built around his ability to keep putting the ball on exactly the right spot. After an unusually expensive first three overs went for 18, Hazlewood had a brief break and returned for the 11th. West Indies were going brightly at 47-1. Former captain Kraigg Brathwaite had flicked a catch from Mitchell Starc to square leg, but John Campbell and Keacy Carty were scoring freely. Facing a line around the wicket, the left-handed Campbell gave up a gift, a kneeling lap shot that lobbed to Carey behind the stumps.The very next ball, Hazlewood’s suffocating line got an inside edge onto pad from Brandon King, lobbing to slip, a golden duck to complete a grim debut for the man who dropped three catches in the first innings. The hat-trick didn’t follow, captain Roston Chase able to leave just outside off, but Hazlewood got him next over, more seam movement and another inside edge to short leg. Then even more jag an over later, and a touch of low bounce, as he knocked Carty’s stumps awry. He had four wickets for 23, West Indies were 65-6, and the match was all but done.Pat Cummins followed Hazlewood’s spell with another lawnmower delivery into Shai Hope’s stumps, but hope had already gone. Alzarri Joseph got a promotion after his late tonk in the first innings, but ran himself out with a slow response to a call from Justin Greaves, Marnus Labuschagne as a sub fielder hitting the stumps direct. Hazlewood returned from a brief break for his fifth thanks to Jomel Warrican, who survived an lbw thanks to umpire’s call then nicked the next, making it 86-8 as extra time began.View image in fullscreenTravis Head hits out during this innings of 61.Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesIt was a subsidence, but one in the expected direction after Australia’s score. In a match dominated by pace, Head and Webster were able to use it to their advantage, scoring almost entirely square of the wicket on the off side, left-hander and right-hander alternating cover drives and back-foot punches to opposite sides of the ground. West Indies frustration mounted as the partnership reached 102, and it took a devilish moment from the pitch to cut off Head for 61, lbw to a ball that almost went underground to hit his pad from around the wicket.That was the first of seven overs from Shamar Joseph either side of lunch, with the other end of his spell getting Webster nicking down the leg side on review for 63. Carey immediately hit the nitro, smacking Jayden Seales straight for four and six before pulling another four in the same over. A second six followed from Greaves, as the Australian keeper raised 50 in 40 balls.With Cummins having skied a catch, Joseph returned to bowl Starc off the inside edge. Fatigue was telling, with a rash of no-balls including a wide beamer, as the tail smacked a few runs. His next break lasted all of four overs, until Chase got Carey out smartly with a wide slow off break lashed to long off. With Joseph on four wickets as he had been in the first innings, he had one last chance to take five, and as at the Gabba 18 months ago, he finished an Australian innings by castling Hazlewood, this time off a flailed bottom edge. The bowler sank to his knees, pounding the pitch with one hand. In three Tests against Australia he has 22 wickets at 16.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not that Shamar Joseph would have expected to follow his five-for by having to go out and bat before the end of the day, with the umpires extending beyond the extra half hour because the required overs hadn’t been bowled.He let out some frustration, lashing 44 from 22 balls, and while aiming for a half-century in one blow, edged Nathan Lyon to slip. That left three balls in the day, and Lyon only needed one. In gathering Friday dusk, it was an hour and 13 minutes after the scheduled close when Seales was caught by Sam Konstas at bat-pad – a chastening end for West Indies, and a dramatic turnaround for Australia. West Indies authorities were desperate for this match to reach the weekend to get some crowds into the party stand. Instead, everyone will hit the beach.Explore more on these topicsAustralia cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

But coming after a four-year absence from first-class cricket, and just 18 overs with a red ball for Sussex this past week, the selection also raised eyebrows.England should be ‘careful’ and save Archer for third India Test, urges FarbraceRead moreAmong them were those of the Sussex head coach, Paul Farbrace, who fanciesEngland should stick with the XIthatsecured a 1-0 lead at Headingley. Key has hinted at this being a possibility, with Archer potentially lined up for the third Test at Lord’s. Either way, England’s managing director has stressed his schedule – a diet of Twenty20 and one-day international cricket these past 18 months – has been a conservative one.“I think we’ve gone slower than we could have done,” Key said on Friday, speaking at an event for the series sponsor, Rothesay. “Jofra has been in a long period where he’s been building up and building up [in white-ball cricket]. The temptation could have been to rush him back sooner. But actually we’ve gone down this road to make sure that we’re in this position now where we’re thinking about playing him.“He could be one of the best bowlers we have had. And you only do that by doing it in Test cricket. Hopefully for the next few years we’ll be fortunate enough to see Jofra have the chance to stake that claim.”Archer’s past injury problems relate to stress fractures in the lower back and elbow, with England ­getting too giddy when he first burst on to the scene in the World Cup and Ashes summer of 2019. The 42 overs he sent down on anabsurdly flat pitch in Mount Maunganuiagainst New Zealand the following winter was a prime example of this, with Key expecting Stokes to avoid the mistake made by his predecessor Joe Root.View image in fullscreenBen Stokes (right) knows how to handle an impact bowler like Jofra Archer, according to England managing director Rob Key.Photograph: ReutersKey said: “These are impact players. You don’t want them doing other roles. That’s where you need complementary skills, so you can share a bit more of the work. The temptation at times with Jofra is that he can do a bit of everything. But you’ve got to use him when he can impact the game and Ben is one of the best at that. You have got to be smart with how you use them so they can help you win a game.”A second round of midsummer County Championship matches starts this Sunday, three days before the second Test, and it may be that one or two seamers who are unlikely to feature at Edgbaston – Jamie Overton and Sam Cook missed out last week – are released to play on the third and fourth days of it, as per the regulations.If held back for Lord’s, Archer could in theory return to play the second half of the match between Sussex and Warwickshire at Hove. As the spare batter in the squad, Jacob Bethell will not be released for it, however, and will remain with England until the toss on Wednesday to provide cover for any late injuries or illness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The fifth Test at the end of July remains a possibility and, just as with hiseffective entrancemidway through the 2023 Ashes, he may not need to prove his fitness with a four-day game.“Wood is someone who could turn up after bowling a bit in the nets, like he did [in 2023], and it’s 96mph, swinging the ball and hitting a length,” said Key. “We’re very fortunate he has the ability to hit his straps pretty much from the start.“Jofra is close to the Mark Wood end of the scale: a pretty pure talent, not a lot of moving parts to his action. He knows exactly what he is doing and what he is about.”Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamJofra ArcherEngland v India 2025CricketnewsShareReuse this content"

How they did that here, and in some style on another impressive evening for Leeds.Super League could expand to 14 teams in 2026 but crucial vote awaitsRead moreThe ultra-demanding Arthur will likely be frustrated with the amount of points his side conceded but credit must go to Leigh, who are in the top four alongside Leeds on merit. But when the Rhinos attacked, they were utterly sensational and were worthy winners to climb above the Leopards and move up to third.There were occasions when Leigh caused Leeds problems, both in-play and on the scoreboard. But the Rhinos rode those moments out, scoring some impressive tries and underlining why, for the first time in a long time, they are being discussed as title contenders.“It was an enjoyable game,” Arthur said. “We showed up to have a response from last week. That’s all I’m worried about and we’ve jumped a spot in the league.” And with Shaun Wane set to name his latest England performance squad on Monday, this was an opportune night for several Rhinos to shine.Few did so more than Jake Connor. The half-back is divisive to say the least but his form since joining Leeds this year has been sensational. Wane is understood to have left Connor out of his latest squad, but this performance, with a plethora of assists and a flawless display from the tee, should have piqued the England coach’s attention.View image in fullscreenLeeds' Kallum Watkins celebrates scoring a try against Leigh.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA“He’s done enough to get a mention,” Arthur said of Connor. It was his kick that led to Kallum Watkins’ opening try and after further scores from Lachlan Miller, Cameron Smith and Harry Newman, Leeds led 24-10 at half-time and entirely on merit. Leigh’s tries in that first half came through Isaac Liu and Keanan Brand, but they were below-par here.That was perhaps due to playing in Perpignan last weekend against Catalans in searing heat, and the Leopards never looked fully themselves. “It was a weird game,” their coach, Adrian Lam, said. “We looked lethargic from last week in that heat.”Their cause wasn’t helped by the loss of star full-back David Armstrong but in truth, this night belonged to Connor. He was involved in Newman’s second before claiming a try of his own to put Leeds 36-14 ahead, and while Leigh would continue to score points of their own late on, with Brand continuing his hat-trick, they were never in the game.That is because the Rhinos continued to post points at will. Tom Holroyd and Mikolaj Oledzki both crossed in the final quarter, with Connor influential in both, to put the seal on another win that suggests come October, we may be discussing Leeds’ fortunes in the big games once again.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueRugby leagueLeeds RhinosLeigh Leopardsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

She also predicted that new technology was coming that would also help Britain’s Keely Hodgkinson break the women’s 800m world record of 1min 53.28sec, which has stood since 1983.“Absolutely there will be a woman running a mile in under four minutes,” she said. “And I think it will take less than 10 years. And if it doesn’t come my way, it will be someone else doing it.”Asked why she was so confident, given the gap was still more than six seconds, she replied: “Going forward, the technology will be even higher than what I was using yesterday. So I think one day, one time, it will happen.”Kipyegon admitted that she had struggled in the final 200m, having heard the bell in 3:01. But she insisted she would not have changed anything about her attempt.“Birds sometimes fall but they fly again,” she said. “I believe I will still lower the world record of 4.07. I want to get it very close to the four minutes mark. And I believe I can still run under 4.05 in a race with female pacemakers.”Kipyegon’s next race will be over 1500m at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon, next week, and she insists she is in shape to challenge her world record of 3:49.04. However she said there are no plans yet to have another crack at the four-minute mile barrier.In Paris she spoke to Hodgkinson, who told her she is hungry to go faster once she has recovered from a hamstring injury. “I talked with Keely yesterday about everything,” said Kipyegon. “And my run was a huge inspiration for her. She’s hungry to go under 1.54 in the 800m. And I think Keely Hodgkinson one day, one time, will run under 1.53.

The case effectively ends the ability of federal judges on lower courts to issue nationwide stays of executive actions that violate the constitution, federal law, and the rights of citizens. And so what the court has actually done is dramatically expand the rights of the president – this president – to nullify constitutional provisions at will.The ruling curtails nationwide injunctions against Trump’s order ending birthright citizenship – meaning that while lawsuits against the order proceed, the court has unleashed a chaotic patchwork of rights enforceability. The Trump administration’s ban on birthright citizenship will not be able to go into effect in jurisdictions where there is no ongoing lawsuit, or where judges have not issued regional stays. And so the supreme court creates, for the foreseeable future, a jurisprudence of citizenship in which babies born in some parts of the country will be presumptive citizens, while those born elsewhere will not.More broadly the decision means that going forward, the enforceable rights and entitlements of Americans will now be dependent on the state they reside in and the status of ongoing litigation in that district at any given time. Donald Trump, personally, will now have the presumptive power to persecute you, and nullify your rights in defiance of the constitution, at his discretion. You can’t stop him unless and until you can get a lawyer, a hearing, and a narrow order from a sympathetic judge.“No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates,” writes Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissent joined by the court’s other two liberals. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, writing separately, adds that the decision is “profoundly dangerous, since it gives the Executive the go-ahead to sometimes wield the kind of unchecked, arbitrary power the Founders crafted our Constitution to eradicate”. She also calls the ruling an “existential threat to the rule of law”.The case concerns anexecutive orderby the Trump administration, issued the day that Trump returned to office, purporting to end birthright citizenship – in defiance of the 14th amendment. When immigrant rights groups, representing American newborns and their migrant parents, sued the Trump administration to enforce their clients’ constitutional rights, a nationwide injunction was issued which paused the Trump administration’s plainly illegal order from going into effect while the lawsuit proceeded. These injunctions are a standard tool in the arsenal of federal judges, and an essential check on executive power: when the president does something wildly illegal, as Trump did, the courts can use injunctions to prevent those illegal actions from causing harm to Americans while litigation is ongoing.Nationwide injunctions have become more common in the Trump era, if only because Trump himself routinely does plainly illegal things that have the potential to hurt people and strip them of their rights nationwide. But they are not used exclusively against Republican presidents, or in order to obstruct rightwing policy efforts.Throughout the Obama and Biden administrations, Republican appointed judges routinely stymied their policy agendas with national injunctions; the Roberts court blessed these efforts. But once Donald Trump returned to power, the court adopted a newer, narrower vision of judges’ prerogatives – or at least, of the prerogatives of judges who are not them. They have, with this ruling, given Donald Trump the sweeping and unprecedented authority to claim presumptive legality of even the most fundamental of American rights: the right of American-born persons to call themselves American at all.Part of why the supreme court’s behavior creates dilemmas for pundits is that the court is acting in with a shameless and exceptional degree of bad faith, such that describing their own accounts of their actions would mean participating in a condescending deception of the reader.In her opinion for the conservative majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett says that the court is merely deferring to the rights of the executive, and ensuring that the president has the freedom to do what the voters elected him to do. Putting aside the ouroboros-like nature of the majority’s conception of electoral legitimacy –that having received a majority of Americans’ votes would somehow entitle Donald Trump to strip them of the rights that made those votes free, meaningful, and informed in the first place – the assertion is also one of bad faith. Because the truth is that this court’s understanding of the scope of executive power is not principled; it is not even grounded in the bad history that Barrett trots out to illustrate her point about the sweeping power of other executives in the historical tradition – like the king of England.Rather, the court expands and contracts its vision of what the president is allowed to do based on the political affiliation of the president that is currently in office. When a Democrat is the president, their vision of executive power contracts. When a Republican is in office, it dramatically expands. That is because these people’s loyalty is not to the constitution, or to a principled reading of the law. It is to their political priors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In this decision, the court did not, technically, reach the merits of Trump’s absurd and insulting claim that the constitution somehow does not create a birthright entitlement to citizenship. But in the meantime, many children – the American-born infants of immigrant parents – will be denied the right that the 14th amendment plainly guarantees them.The rightwing legal movement, and the Trumpist judges who have advanced it, have long believed that really, this is a white man’s country – and that the 14th amendment, with its guarantees of equal protection and its vision of a pluralist nation of equals, living together in dignity across difference – was an error. Those babies, fully American despite their differences and their parents’ histories, are squirming, cooing testaments to that better, more just future. They, and the hope that they represent, are more American than Trump and his crony judges will ever be.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

I still won’t be voting for itPeter LambThe government’s concessions would still leave thousands in distress. I can see a better way – and I urge No 10 to finally listenPeter Lamb is the Labour MP for CrawleyFri 27 Jun 2025 12.57 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 13.13 EDTShareReading the news you could be forgiven for thinking a week of drama in Westminster had finallyconcluded on Friday morning, with a deal between the government and some of the Labour MPs who signed the proposed reasoned amendment to the universal credit and personal independence payment (Pip) bill.No doubt the changes will be sufficient for some colleagues, but having considered the concessions offered, I’m afraid that as things stand I – and a large number of other signatories – cannot support what is being proposed when voting takes place on Tuesday.This isn’t something I do easily. TheLabourparty is my home. I was born into a family of Labour activists and joined as soon as I was able. I was a student activist, a councillor and then an MP for Crawley. I have campaigned in every election from Neil Kinnock to Keir Starmer and I didn’t spend 14 years fighting to return Labour to government just so I could cause trouble.However, 14 years in local government taught me a few things, not least the utter devastation to households and neighbourhoods directly caused by the Tories’ cuts to social security. I am loyal to my country, my constituency and my party – that is precisely why, on this bill, I cannot be loyal to the government.I accept that theconcessions are an improvement. By making it clear that those already in receipt of Pip will continue to receive it, there is a hope we can avoid the tragicloss of life that followedthe last set of disability cuts. Yet at its core, the bill remains a cost-cutting exercise. No matter the level of involvement of disability groups in co-producing a scheme for new applicants, to save money the proposed changes will inevitably result in people with high levels of need losing the support necessary to wash themselves, dress themselves and feed themselves.From the start, I have tried to use the routes available to MPs to improve what was on offer, beginning with the No 10 engagement meetings immediately prior to the publication of the green paper and ending last week with visits to very senior figures and the whips’ office. I made it clear to them that they did not have the numbers and that pushing the vote would only damage the government – and I proposed an alternative path.So, what is the alternative?The government estimatesPip for working age people will cost by 2030. According to the latest statistics, 40% of recipients have psychiatric disorders, which include mental health issues such as mixed anxiety and depression. Waiting lists to diagnose and treat these conditions are huge. Research by the charity Rethink Mental Illness shows that people areeight times more likelyto wait more than 18 months for mental health treatment than for physical conditions. The solution is obvious: a short-term boost in funding to clear the backlog. This would mean more social workers, psychologists, specialist pharmacists, psychiatrists, therapists and counsellors to treat people and in turn support them into work.Of course, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) presents a challenge, having previously discounted the potential impact of various medical or employment support interventions in getting economically inactive people into the workforce. It explains that this is because the Treasury fails to provide it with the evidence necessary to justify savings conclusions, including for the£1bn of work incentivesset out in the bill. In practice, this means that cuts rather than support are favoured in government policy.Another tragic fact about this disastrous welfare bill: it proves Labour hasn’t learned and doesn’t truly listen | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThe Treasury has to do better if public service reform is to succeed, working with the OBR to develop the evidence base that interventions will deliver outcomes, and factoring this into its economic predictions. To that end, they should make use of the Integrated Data Service, which includes information on what medical interventions are helping to support people back into work.Throughout my many conversations with decision-makers, I have repeatedly set out the case for alternatives and had them ignored. As a Labour MP, if I am going to remove the support disabled people need to undertake the basic activities of life, I need the government to demonstrate why that is the best option available. So far, that case has still not been made.Peter Lamb is the Labour MP for CrawleyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s the sort of statement that might have once shocked people but is now just another news bulletin.Following Israel’s ‘pre-emptive strike’ on Iran earlier this month, which happened just as more people started speaking up about the genocide, attention has been averted from Gaza. But Israel’s assault on Gaza (and the West Bank), is continuing apace.With the pressure off, the fear is that some of the most extreme voices in Israel will get exactly what they want in Gaza. Which, as retired Maj Gen Giora Eiland wrote in an Israeli paper on12 October 2023, is to turn into “a place where no human being can exist”.To remind you of what some of these voices have planned forGaza, below is a collection of some of the more outrageous statements by Israeli lawmakers or influencers since 7 October 2023.I’ve limited the collection to 20, but there are databases online with hundreds of statements which show a blurring of Hamas and the population of Gaza (including children) and a desire to inflict collective punishment. The end goal of all this is not the removal of Hamas from Gaza, but the removal of all Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank.“All of Gaza’s infrastructures must be destroyed to its foundation and their electricity cut off immediately. The war is not against Hamas but against the state of Gaza,” said May Golan, minister for social equality and the advancement of the status of women of Israel on7 October 2023.“Flatten everything [in Gaza] just like it is today in Auschwitz,” David Azoulay, council leader for the northern Israeli town of Metula, said in aninterviewwith an Israeliradio station, December 2023.“[I]t’s an entire nation out there that is responsible. it’s not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware not involved, it’s absolutely not true …” Isaac Herzog, Israel’s president, said at a press conference on 13 October(in English).“Now we all have one common goal – erasing the Gaza Strip from the face of the Earth” Nissim Vaturi, deputy speaker of the Israeli parliament, wrote on X7 October 2023. Vaturi also wrote: “The war will never end if we don’t expel everyone.” (2 November 2023) and “To wipe out Gaza. Nothing else will satisfy us … Don’t leave a single child there, expel all the remaining ones in the end, so they have no chance of recovery.” (9 October 2023)“The children and women must be separated and the adults in Gaza must be eliminated. We are being too considerate,” Vaturi said during an interview withKol BaRama radioin February 2025, when he alsocalled Palestinians“subhumans” and said the West Bank would be turned into Gaza next.“The Gaza Strip should be flattened, and for all of them there is but one sentence, and that is death,” Yitzhak Kroizer, a member of national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir’s far-right Otzma Yehudit party, said in a radio interview. This did not get much international coverage but was cited in the lettersent to the attorney generalat the end of 2023 accusing the country’s judicial authorities of ignoring incitement to genocide.“Gaza won’t return to what it was before. We will eliminate everything,” Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant, saidOctober 2023. (Gallant was in this position at the time of the statement but is no longer in government)“I’m not sure you’re speaking for us when you say we want to treat every child and every woman. I hope you don’t stand behind that statement either. When fighting a group like this, the distinctions that exist in a normal world don’t exist,” said Likud parliament member Amit Halevi in the Knessest, in response to a statement from an Israeli doctor saying suffering children should get painkillers,May 2025.“The children in Gaza have brought this upon themselves,” said Meirav Ben-Ari from Yair Lapid’sopposition party Yesh Atidin response to a Palestinian lawmaker bemoaning the loss of civilian life on16 October 2023.“There should be 2 goals for this victory: 1. There is no more Muslim land in the Land of Israel ... After we make it the land of IL, Gaza should be left as a monument, like Sodom …” said Likud member of the Knesset Amit Halevi on16 October 2023.“They [the children] are our enemies,” said Simcha Rothman, a member of the Knesset for the National Religious party, part of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition. Rothman was responding to a question from aChannel 4 (UK) interviewer asking “the children are your enemies?”The following statements were all made on Channel 14: a far-right TV station that used to be a niche outlet but has morphed into one of the most watched news sources in Israel. Three civil rights organization have asked for an investigation into Channel 14 for its normalization of genocidal statements.“This is clearly not a matter of a few isolated voices saying outrageous things in the heat of the moment,” Ran Cohen, the director of the Israeli Democratic bloc said in a statement to the Guardian. “The pattern of incitement emerging from Channel 14 is systematic, sustained, and orchestrated – not incidental. We have documented hundreds of statements, many delivered by regular hosts and guests, broadcast daily into Israeli homes and directly watched by soldiers. The line between media and war propaganda has been erased.”“If the goal of this operation is not destruction, occupation, expulsion, and settlement, then we have accomplished nothing,” said former member of the Israeli Knesset, Moshe Feiglin, on12 October 2023.“Erase Gaza completely, don’t leave a single person there” said singer Eyal Golan, on 15 October 2023. Since making a number of statements like this, Golan has gone on to perform concerts in Europe.“We are coming. We are coming. We are coming to Gaza. We are coming to Lebanon. We will come to Iran. We will come to every place [...] We will annihilate the enemy. We will return the Middle East to a situation where Arabs are terrified of Jews [...] we will come to annihilate you [emphasizes]. To a-n-n-i-h-i-l-a- t-e. Annihilate. Pass this on, share this video so all your friends can see what we are about to do to you,” said the anchor of Channel 14’s morning show, Shai Golden, 17 October 2023.“The enemy is not Hamas, but Gaza. The enemy is not Fatah, but the Arabs of the West Bank. And they are not willing to accept this because the approach to dealing with this enemy, called ‘Gaza,’ needs to be completely different [...] Similar to Chechnya, where the Russians flattened it to the extent that the Chechens realized: it’s not worth thinking with them [...] There are no innocents. When you say ‘population’, there is no population. There are two and a half million terrorists [...] When there are no innocents in Gaza, there’s no point in ‘roof knocking’. Because everyone is a terrorist,” said Eliahu Yusian, who presents himself as an expert and commentator on Arab affairs. He is a frequent guest on Channel 14, was a guest on the show The Patriots and said all the above without interruption on29 October 2023.“I keep looking beyond the military objectives, which is nice, but in the end, there’s something beyond the military objectives, and that’s the strategy. It’s about breaking the spirit of the Gazan public, and things are happening there,” Shimon Riklin said on 21 February 2024.“… every day we’re killing 100 terrorists? There are two and a half million terrorists there!” panelist Eliahu Yusian said on 24 February 2024.“Regarding what Boaz mentioned, in the first day or two, we should have killed 100,000 Gazans [...] Only a few are possibly human there. Only a few are possibly human there. Over 90% are terrorists and are involved! Not uninvolved, there’s no such thing as uninvolved,” political commentator Danny Neuman said on journalist Boaz Golan’s show on 6 May 2024.“The destruction in Gaza gives me a good feeling. Gaza is in a state of annihilation. Many buildings no longer exist in the landscape. The destruction machine must keep working so it’s clear they have nowhere to return to. Despair as a work plan,” Yinon Magal said on the show The Patriots reading a tweet by a reservist soldier named Dvir Luger on 3 August 2024.“Gaza deserves death. The 2.6 million terrorists in Gaza deserve death! … Men, women, and children – in every way possible, we must simply carry out a Holocaust on them – yes, read that again – H-O-L-O-C-A-U-S-T! For me, gas chambers. Train cars. And other cruel forms of death for these Nazis. Without fear, without hesitation – simply crush, eradicate, slaughter, flatten, dismantle, smash, shatter …. Gaza deserves death. Let there be a Holocaust in Gaza,” said Elad Barashi, a TV producer affiliated with Channel 14, on 27 February 2025. in apost on Xwhich was later deleted.It’s clear now that nothing will shame the West into stopping Israel from carrying out its “total victory” in Gaza. But I’ve written this to serve as yet another reminder that we all knew what was coming. Nobody can feign ignorance. Nobody can pretend they didn’t know.Arwa Mahdwai is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriescommentShareReuse this content"

The Teddy Bears’ Picnic (what a big surprise in the woods it must have been, especially to whoever was responsible for keeping the enclosure secure!), Winnie-the-Pooh, a suggestion of Paddington in the eminent reasonableness of it all, plus European brown bears being by far the cutest and most childhood-teddy-like of all. This is the good news story we need. Enjoy it. The year is shaping up … badly.TuesdayMish and Lucy were originally rescued from an Albanian snow drift. I am on my way to Devon to ask them for directions back there. Summer, the vilest of all seasons, is properly here. Once again I appear to have neglected to get my air-conditioned bunker built in time and so I am stuck on this boiling isle, whose architecture, culture, working and retail hours are designed to cope only with temperatures of “brisk” and below.I was born in a cardigan. That is how I need to live. Not least because when I am forced to expose skin to sun it not only burns but makes me an instant smorgasbord of haemo-delights for any and every passing bug. I say passing – I’m pretty sure some of them fly in specially, a date on their little bug calendars saying: “Mangan meat feast begins”. Bastards. Venomous little bastards.From now until the end of August, I am an ambulant mass of swellings, slippery with hydrocortisone cream and stuporous with anti-histamine meds. “Does not cause drowsiness,” they say. They do if you take them by the boxful, fools.

People of Britain, you are upsetting the brave asset management companies of this country. News breaks that we are saving too much. In cash, of all things! Instead of investing in stocks and shares – thereby helping the economy, and asset management companies – we are insisting on having ready access to a certain and definable store of our money so that we can ride out personal and professional crises as well as the boring, ongoing one apparently without end known as “the cost of living”.Will no one think of the global funds and their traders (I hope I’m using these words correctly – could a rich person check)? If we all just keep hold of our cash and use it to pay for basic goods and services, where’s the excitement? Where are the ecstatic highs and perilous lows of playing the markets? Is the economy just supposed to manage without our contributions? We’re there to serve it, remember, not the other way round!I love the world of finance, in which everything is turned upside down and everyone looks at you as if pound coins are sentient and that this is exactly the way things are supposed to be. It enables me to look at the nugatory balance in my determinedly current account paying no interest and feel that at least I am by my simple absence from the FTSE 100 sticking it to The Man.Thursday“What do you want for your tea when you come on Friday?” Mum asks me on the WhatsApp family chat, because my sister and I taught her how to use the app after Dad died, heedless of the consequences because we weren’t thinking straight.“Chicken and mushroom, please.”“No.”“But you said you’d made some last week?”“That was for the freezer.”Sensing the need for back up approaching, my sister joins.“Are you saying – that it can’t come out of the freezer? Does it have to stay in the freezer for ever? I remind you that we have power of attorney come the day we have proof your mental faculties have deteriorated to dangerous levels.”“Not for ever. But it hasn’t been in there long.”“So – like not being able to sit on the sofa for two hours after you’ve plumped the cushions, we can’t eat food from the freezer until it’s been in there long enough for you to revel in the results of your labour?”“Also, I’ve only done portions for three. There’ll only be two of us.”“…” says my sister.“…” say I.We’re having a Co-op fish pie.FridayBreak out the bubbly and throw on your glad rags – the wedding is about to begin! Jeff Bezos and his money have arrived in Venice to join with his fiancee, Lauren Sánchez, in holy matrimony at an estimated cost of between £34m and £41m, or about two hours and 40 minutes of the Amazon founder’s earnings.It has everything a wedding should have. The Kardashians, a newly-single Orlando Bloom, and widespread protests at the multi-billionaire essentially renting the entire city for the three-day nuptial event.You have to hope, though, that at its heart it is the same as every other wedding. And I do believe that money cannot buy certain things. It cannot buy, I suspect, guests who truly want to take three days out of their busy lives and in uncomfortable shoes to watch two people say some vows in a church, however garlanded, and then be forced to celebrate their bliss for hours and hours thereafter, no matter how free-flowing or top quality the booze. Money can’t buy an absence of boring relatives or freedom from the fear of being seated beside one. Above all, of course, money can’t buy love. Though I am sure this precious state of grace is absolutely at the core of this extravaganza. The rest is noise. Especially from the Kardashian table, I suspect.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekcommentShareReuse this content"

You can only antagonize your base for so longFri 27 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 08.31 EDTShareWe’re told that the Democratic party is at a crossroads, that leaders have lost their identity and their way. We’re told that they must spend millions discovering their own “Joe Rogan”, or espouse deregulation, or surrender the fight for the rights of targeted minorities. TheDemocrats, we’re told, are in a moment of soul searching, of trying to find out how they lost young men and the white working class. They’re still thinking, half a decade on, of how to undo the supposed damage of the 2020 summer, when protesters opposed to the extrajudicial killings of Black civilians shouted: “Defund the police.” The subtext of this handwringing, which has been incessant in the media and among party insiders since the November election, is that the party must move, yet again, to the right. It is presumed that they can’t attract voters otherwise.The apparent victory (still unofficial because the counting won’t technically be complete until July) of a 33-year-old socialist in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary this week suggests otherwise.Zohran Mamdani, a state assemblymember from Queens, was a little-known leftwing activist whose campaign against the former governor and New York household name Andrew Cuomo was polling in the single digits. But with immense personal charisma and a talent for retail politicking, airtight message discipline centered on making life affordable, and a small army of motivated young volunteers, Mamdani defeated a political dynasty, defied conventional wisdom, and is expected to win the American left its biggest electoral victory since Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s primary coup in 2018.In the process, his campaign presented a new vision of the party: one that has energized voters with its authenticity and moral vision even as major donors and the party establishment have balked. The leaders of the Democratic establishment have long believed that the party’s left flank was its greatest liability. Mamdani has proven that it can be an asset.Mamdani stood firm in his support of Gaza. The Democratic party could learn from him | Yousef MunayyerRead moreAny responsible commentator will tell you that Mamdani’s success in theNew Yorkmayoral primary will be difficult for other progressive candidates to replicate. The city’s public campaign-funds matching program allowed the candidate to spend his time in highly visible public engagement with the people of New York – rather than on fundraising efforts among the rich. The ranked-choice voting system – still relatively new – incentivized him and the crowded other field of candidates to form a united front against Cuomo, and allowed Mamdani to capture the crucial endorsement of his fellow candidate Brad Lander, the beloved New York City comptroller.Mamdani, too, seems to have the kind of personal talent that is rare in any politician: a relaxed and personable demeanor, an uncommon gift for oratory, and a rhetoric of morality and dignity that appears not just plausibly authentic but genuinely inspiring, and is already drawing comparisons to liberal political giants like AOC and the young Barack Obama. Crucially, too, Mamdani is uncommonly disciplined: he avoided attacking the progressive liberals, like Lander and state senator Zellnor Myrie, who were slightly to his right, preferring to unite with them and recruit them into his movement, a gesture of pragmatic generosity that kept the field from turning into a circular firing squad. And he has a gravitas that most of us could not rise to, enduring cynical and often racist smears from Cuomo supporters, whocalled him antisemiticfor his support of human rights for Palestinians with a calm dignity that emphasized his loyalty to all New Yorkers, Jewish or otherwise. All of this – his incentives, his talents – contributed to his victory. None will be easy to recreate in another race.And yet Mamdani’s victory is a signal of a subterranean shift happening in the base of the Democratic party – the younger, more motivated, more active voters who the party leadership relies on but does not quite trust. The Democratic party’s leaders – like Nancy Pelosi of California, but prominently including Mamdani’s fellow New Yorkers Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries – havelargely rolled overin the second Trump administration, failing to use either their procedural power or their public platforms to create leverage against the Maga agenda or advance an alternative vision for the country.Their passivity and risk aversion has stood in contrast to the mounting energy of their voters, whose anger at Trump’s authoritarian ambitions, racist immigration policies and broader rollback of rights has sparked a growing protest movement. Energized liberal voters find that the Democratic politicians they elected to represent them are passive and complacent, even in the face of what they themselves correctly described, in 2024, as the ascent of a fascist movement. The party’s rhetoric is not being matched by its actions, and its actions are not matching its voters’ passions. Indeed, the party appears most energetic when it is crushing the ambitions of its charismatic younger members, as when it denied powerful committee positions toAOCand Texas’sJasmine Crockett.Establishment Democrats seem, if anything, as if they want to disappear, to be absolved of their responsibility to advance a political agenda of their own. This might be why they have fled, repeatedly, rightward, away from their own professed principles. This might be why they lined up, during the mayoral primary,behind Cuomo, the disgraced former governor whom many of them had called on to resign just four years ago his candidacy was a promise that their own structures of power and patronage would remain intact, that nothing much would change. Mamdani represented a threat to their own vision of a do-nothing political party. For that, theytried to crush him.You can only antagonize your own base for so long before they begin to notice. In a new poll conducted just days before Mamdani’s upset victory, fully 62% of Democratic voters said that their party needs new leadership. Mamdani – youthful, energetic, and actually interested in governance – offers both a rebuke to the Democratic establishment and a vision of the party’s renewal. It may be coming whether the Democratic National Committee likes it or not. Fed up with their useless, antagonist leadership and unwilling to give up on the prospect of progressive change, many members of the Democrats’ hated base are certain to follow Mamdani’s example, taking risks to challenge unpopular or ineffectual incumbents and entrenched local party machines. Since Bill Clinton’s victory in 1992, the Democrats have been trying to reinvent themselves as a more conservative party, assuming that their future lay rightward. They were looking in the wrong direction.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionDemocratsNew YorkcommentShareReuse this content"

That’s not the way civilised countries do democracyFri 27 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 09.04 EDTShareLook at the coverage of any general election opinion polling recently and what you are likely to see is a map of Britain divided into its constituencies and covered in Reform’s light blue. They are utterly dominant when it comes to the projected seats. Take the latestYouGov MRP poll, published with great fanfare this week. MRP (multilevel regression and poststratification) is a particularly detailed kind of poll that creates projections for each constituency – and this one predicted that Nigel Farage’s party would win a whopping 42% of the seats inside the House of Commons if a general election were held now. Even this was fairly low compared with some other recent data that actually projecteda majority of 30 seats.But while Farage and some parts of the media really want you to focus on the number of seats Reform might win, what you should be looking at is what the data is actually telling us. Stay with me on this. Because, while the latest YouGov poll may show Reform achieving 42% of UK seats, the proportion of people in the UK who actually support them, according to that same poll, is only 26%. What we really should be taking from the latest data is the headline “three-quarters of UK votersdon’twant Nigel Farage and Reform”. Only one in four people want them in government.When you think about it like this, the ridiculousness of the current system is laid bare. This party is unpopular with most of the voters, yet the question on Westminster watchers’ lips is: “Can they win a majority?” This warps the discourse around our entire political system and creates the impression that most of the public want something that they self-evidently don’t.If you need more convincing as to how the UK’s first-past-the-post system is spinning politics to the extremes, take a look at the part of the UK where Reform are polling even better – Wales. Recent polls in Wales have shown Reform and Plaid Cymru vying for first place ahead of the Senedd (Welsh parliament) elections next year.The latest pollputs Reform in first place with 29%.But in Wales there is no genuine conversation (outside the Reform party itself) about Reform really being able to form a government next year. And why is this? It is because in Cymru we have a system that is far more proportional. There is simply no way that any party can come close to a majority with less than a third of the vote. Call me crazy, but in a democracy, doesn’t that make sense?Let me give you an example. Ina poll at the start of Maylooking at voting intentions in Wales, Plaid Cymru got 30% and Reform UK 25%. When it came to seat projections inside the Senedd (which has 96 seats), Plaid was projected about 35 and Reform 30. This is broadly reflective of the numbers of people who would have voted for them. So Reform could easily be the largest party in Wales next year. I think it will be. But there is still very little chance of it forming a government for the plain and simple reason that its politics are miles away from the views of most people in Wales.Inside the Senedd there are six parties who can realistically win seats: Plaid,Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, the Conservatives and Reform. All those first four parties have categorically ruled out working with Farage. The only party that would do so is the Tories, but all the evidence suggests that most of Reform’s gains are coming at their expense. So the better Reform does, the smaller is its only prospective coalition partner likely to be. This is the benefit of proportional democracy in action: it stops extremes guiding the agenda.Imagine you and 12 mates are going out. Three of you want to go have a cappuccino, three want lattes and three want flat whites. You all want coffee but can’t quite agree on which specific one, but broadly you are in agreement on what you want to do. But imagine that the remaining four want to go out to get battered on Special Brew and smash up a bar. Under first-past-the-post, because there are more people wanting Special Brew than cappuccino, lattes or flat whites respectively, you are all condemned to go out on the piss.Under the Welsh setup, and frankly those of most healthy democratic systems (like those in New Zealand, Finland and Norway), the direction of the nation is as close as possible to the view of most of its people, not simply the largest minority. Whereas the UK as a whole is going to be forced to go out on the lash by Reform even though they really want a nice cup of coffee.If Keir Starmer really wants to counter Reform, he needs to change an electoral process that punishes parties for having broad appeal. It’s the single biggest change he can make as prime minister that will stop the hard right seizing power. Will he have the courage to do away with a system that gave his own party63% of the seats on just 34% of the vote? I doubt it. But if he is serious about putting country over party, he must.Will Hayward is a Guardian columnist.

Its allies are complicit in the horror; they must instead help to build a future for PalestiniansFri 27 Jun 2025 14.15 EDTFirst published on Fri 27 Jun 2025 13.18 EDTShare“We cannot be asking civilians to go into a combat zone so that then they can be killed with the justification that they are in a combat zone.” It defies belief that the Unicef spokesperson, James Elder, should have needed to spell that out this week. And yet each day Palestinians continue to be killed while attempting to collect aid for their families from food hubs in Gaza, forced to make a lethal choice between risking being shot and letting their families slowly starve. More than 500 have died around the centres since the system was introduced – yet, with attention fixed on Israel’s attacks on Iran, there has been little to spare for recent deaths.The Israeli military has given shifting accounts of events. But soldiers told the newspaper Haaretz that commandersordered troops to shoot at crowdsthat posed no threat. The Israeli prime minister and defence minister attacked the allegations as “blood libels”. Médecins Sans Frontières has accurately described the system as “slaughter masquerading as humanitarian aid”. Meanwhile, Israel hasclosed crossings into the north.Overall, Gaza’s health ministry says that 56,331 people have died in Israeli attacks since war began. Researchers who assess war casualties suggested this week that, far from being exaggerated, this undercounts the toll. Theyestimatedthat violent deaths had reached 75,000 by this January, with another 8,500 excess deaths due to the war. The toll of hunger has yet to be reckoned.The ceasefire with Iran has prompted talk that Benjamin Netanyahu may be contemplating an early election, hoping to ride to victory on the glory. That would be tough without the release of hostages and at least the impression of an end to the war in Gaza. Yet it remains unclear whether there isactual movementtowards a deal with Hamas. Donald Trump’s hazy vision of a grand deal for the Middle East is built upon a fantasy ofArab state acquiescencewithout any concrete offer for Palestinians.Without a proper agreement, the threat of strikes resuming would loom large, there would be no promise that proper aid would follow, and recovery would be impossible. The far-right coalition partners upon whom Mr Netanyahu depends want the “day after” to bring not a resurgence of life but the disappearance of Palestinians from Gaza – and beyond. Thesurging violenceand mass displacements in the occupied West Bank, which have seen 943 Palestinians killed by settlers or security forces since 7 October 2023, have been described as“Gazafication”. Meanwhile, Israelentrenches its controlpolitically.As Israel’s allies stand by – or, like Mr Trump, spur on horrorssuch as the food scheme– the necessary destination of a two-state solution is becoming a mirage. Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, hassuggestedopenly that the US no longer sees an independent Palestinian state as a goal. European nations, including the UK, which had edged towards recognising one, have backed off since Israel attacked Iran.A review by the diplomatic service of the EU – Israel’s biggest trading partner – found that the country wasprobably breaching human rights dutiesunder their trade deal, yet the bloc has not acted accordingly. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, rightly urged the EU to suspend the accord. While the arms and trade still flow, Israel’s allies are complicit in the destruction of lives in Gaza. They must instead make themselves central to building a future for Palestinians in a state of their own.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Sir Keir Starmer has now stagedthree conspicuous retreats: over winter fuel payments, over grooming gangs and now – most perilously – over sweeping changes to disability benefits. Two of these reversals followed backbench unrest. This week’s about-face on the government’s flagshipwelfare billlooks less like a full U-turn than a partial climbdown designed to avert open rebellion.While Sir Keir has taken astep backover benefit changes, which affect the most vulnerable in society, the result resembles textbook damage control. The concessions, presented as a response to principled pressure, feel more like fallback options held in reserve for moments of internal disquiet.The first is that existing personal independence payment (Pip) claimants will be spared new, tighter assessments – at least for now. But about430,000new Pip claimants who would qualify under current rules still face being excluded when tougher criteria arrive in November 2026. The second is that the health element of universal credit will no longer be frozen for current recipients. But new claimants – many toounwellto work – will be placed on a reduced rate unless they meet a higher threshold. All Pip awards are periodically reassessed, implying that all recipients could eventually face the new scheme.The upshot is that existing claimants would be protected, but future ones face tougher rules. Two people with identical conditions could receive support, according to theInstitute for Fiscal Studies, that differs by up to £6,560 a year – purely due to timing. This, we’re told, is compassion. The savings – halved to £2.5bn a year – come by offloading the cost on to future claimants. MPs rightly fear this locks in a two-tier system that is deliberately harsher on disabled people.Older Labour MPs will remember denouncing this very playbook. A decade ago,Iain Duncan Smithpioneered a slow, procedural tightening of welfare – hitting new claimants first, then reassessing the rest – precisely to defuse resistance. Labour opposed it then. Today, it is governing by the same method. It feels out of step with a post-pandemic Britain grappling with a cost of living crisis.ManyLabour MPsbelieve these are still the wrong reforms and will vote against the bill when it comes back to the House of Commons next week. Clearly, tightened eligibility and a two-tier system may exclude many who need support. If the government wants to raise money, it might ask a little more of those with the broadest shoulders – not those with mobility aids, care plans and the audacity to ask for a fair deal. If ministers truly believe they are acting decently, they should publish theimpact assessmentand be honest about the consequences.Perhaps the most telling lesson is not about policy detail, but about political temperament. Modern governments are always under pressure to appear fiscally restrained. Yet whether – or how – they choose to meet that pressure reveals what they value, and who they believe can be asked to bear the costs. The welfare state has always relied on consent, and on a basic sense offairness. If a Labour government cannot convincingly defend that principle, it risks more than backbench unrest; it risks eroding the trust that makes reform, essential in any changing society, possible in the first place.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In a major escalation this year, the M23 rebel group made a rapid territorial advance against the Congolese military and its allies in eastern DRC in fighting thatkilled thousandsand displaced hundreds of thousands.“They were going at it for many years, and with machetes – it is one of the worst, one of the worst wars that anyone has ever seen,” Trump said before the signing ceremony.He went on to say: “We’re getting, for the United States, a lot of the mineral rights from the Congo as part of it. They’re so honoured to be here. They never thought they’d be coming.”Congo’s foreign minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner highlighted the agreement’s promises of a respect for sovereignty.“By signing this agreement, we reaffirm a simple truth. Peace is a choice, but also a responsibility to respect international law, to uphold human rights and to protect sovereignty of states,” she said.M23 is among more than 100 armed groups fighting against Congolese forces in the mineral-rich eastern DRC. The group, which is led by Tutsis, says it exists to protect the interests of minorities such as the Tutsis, including protecting them from Hutu rebel groups who escaped to the DRC after taking part in the 1994 genocide that targeted the Tutsis.The DRC, the UN, the US and other countries say the militia is supported byRwanda. UN experts say Rwanda uses the group to extract and export valuable minerals – a claim Rwanda denies.Rwanda has also denied directly supporting the rebels and has demanded an end to another armed group, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which was established by ethnic Hutus linked to the massacres of Tutsis in the genocide.The agreement signed on Friday calls for the “neutralisation” of the FDLR.Map of M23 areas of operations in DRCIn a joint statement before the signing, the three countries said the agreement would include “respect for territorial integrity and a prohibition of hostilities” and the disarmament of all “non-state armed groups”.The statement also spoke of a “regional economic integration framework” and of a future summit in Washington bringing together Trump, the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, and the DRC president, Félix Tshisekedi.The deal has come under scrutiny for its vagueness, including on the economic component, with the Trump administration eager to profit from abundant mineral wealth in eastern DRC.The agreement aims to attract western investment to the two countries’ mining sectors, which contain deposits of tantalum, gold, cobalt, copper and lithium, while giving the US access to critical minerals.Rwandan talks with US over deported migrants are chance to expand its influenceRead moreDenis Mukwege, a gynaecologist who shared the 2018 Nobel peace prize for his work to end the DRC’s epidemic of sexual violence in war, last week said the mediation process was “opaque”, failed to talk about justice and reparations and avoided “recognition of Rwanda’s aggression against the DRC”.Calling for justice and reparations, he saidon social media: “In its current state, the emerging agreement would amount to granting a reward for aggression, legitimising the plundering of Congolese natural resources, and forcing the victim to alienate their national heritage by sacrificing justice in order to ensure a precarious and fragile peace.”Reuters andAgence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaAfricaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpMiningnewsShareReuse this content"

The killings and subsequent manhunt unsettled the state.On Friday, Minnesotans lined up by the hundreds outside and inside the state capitol to pay their respects. One by one, they moved toward the rotunda. Many wiped away tears. Others did the sign of the cross. Some put their hands on their hearts. The mourners included former president Joe Biden.‘True model of humility’: hundreds pay tribute to victims of Minnesota killingsRead moreSome brought their children, waiting in line patiently to say goodbye. Many carried flowers – daffodils, daisies, zinnias, roses. Golden retrievers sat outside the doors of the capitol, waiting people to pet them and to comfort those who came to grieve.A second line waited to drop off flowers and other items of remembrance at a memorial upstairs near the House chambers. There, thousands of flowers decorated a hallway of tables. Interspersed were dog treats, stuffed animals and hundreds of notes from people who told the Hortmans what they meant to Minnesota.One photo left at the memorial shows Hortman behind a lectern with the presidential seal, noting that she was one of a group of state lawmakers invited to Washington by then-president Barack Obama. “I can’t comprehend her being gone, but I’m realizing how much I loved her,” wrote the person who left the photo.“Remembering your strong leadership for low-income Minnesotans and your dedication to policies so that all people have a home,” one sign said.“Melissa is our hero,” wrote another.Melissa is the first woman in Minnesota history to lie in state at the Capitol. She joins a long list of Minnesota governing greats – a list her colleagues say she deserves to be on for her accomplishments. Tim Walz, the governor, has called her the “most consequential House speaker in state history”.One man got to the capitol at 6.30am to wait for the doors to open at noon, hetold Minnesota Public Radio. Mike Starr said he once was hosted by the Hortmans at their home and wanted to pay his respects and show thanks for everything Melissa had done for the state.“She stood up for the people and that she didn’t spin the story, she didn’t mislead people,” Starr said. “She let you know who she was. And you know, when she said something, she meant it.”Some came from out of state to say goodbye. Debra Lehrmann, Texas supreme court justice and a friend of the Hortmans, came to the capitol,according to the Star Tribune. “Melissa is the kind of person you’re drawn to,” she told the paper.In the days since her death, her friends and colleagues – and those who didn’t personally know her, but felt her impact –have sharedwhat she meant to them. They cited an ability to bring people together and find common ground alongside a whip-smart intellect and a witty sense of humor.Above all, she cared about Minnesota – and Minnesota cared back.Explore more on these topicsMinnesotanewsShareReuse this content"

On Wednesday, days before his trial was set to begin, he pleaded guilty to four federal counts, related to accusations that he helped lead a drug-trafficking group within the Venezuelan government.“Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios was once one of the most powerful men inVenezuela. For years, he and other officials … used cocaine as a weapon – flooding New York and other American cities with poison,” said US attorney Jay Clayton.Venezuela’s ex-spy chief extradited from Spain to US to face drug chargesRead moreCarvajal turned against Maduro in 2019 and supported a failed coup that year led by the opposition leader Juan Guaidó. Maduro stayed in power but the Trump administration at the time recognized Guaidó as the legitimate leader of the country.Despite his opposition to Maduro, Carvajal was already under investigation by the US government: in 2020, the justice department released an indictment against him and other top Venezuelan leaders – including Maduro himself – accusing them of narco-terrorism crimes and of running the Cartel of the Suns. He waseventually extraditedto the US from Spain in 2023.The USindictmentalleges that from 1999 through 2020, Maduro, Carvajal and top government officials “participated in a corrupt and violent narco-terrorism conspiracy” between the Cartel of the Suns and the former Colombian rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), to traffic cocaine to the US. The Farc was previously classified as a terrorist organization by the US government before most of its memberslaid down their weaponsin a historic 2016 peace process.Although the US government claims the Cartel of the Suns is a structured and government-run drug-trafficking group,analysts claimthat it is more of a “network of networks” of various drug-trafficking groups protected by elements within the Venezuelan state.The Miami Herald, citing unnamed sources,reportedthat Carvajal was potentially collaborating with the US government to provide information about Maduro’s drug-trafficking activities, theTren de Araguagang and Venezuela’s ties to Iran.Details of his potential collaboration may be revealed during his sentencing hearing in October. He is facing life in prison for each count.Co-defendants in the Cartel of the Suns case include Maduro, the Venezuelan interior minister and two former Farc leaders –including one who was killed in amysterious operationby the Colombian military.As one of the last Latin America-related acts of the Biden administration this January, the US governmentraised its bounty for Maduroand hisinterior ministerto $25m, related to the narco-terrorism case.‘His head wasn’t in the world of reality’: how the plot to invade Venezuela fell apartRead moreOne of Carvajal’s co-defendants was sentenced last year to more than 21 years in prison. Cliver Alcalá , a former Venezuelan general who opposed Maduro, pleaded guilty in 2023 for providing support to the Farc.This case has the potential to uncover details of US operations in Venezuela, including information about alleged US-backed attempts to oust Maduro.In a letter to the New York court, Alcalá’s attorneys have claimed that the Central Intelligence Agency, Drug Enforcement Administration, and national security council were aware of afumbled 2020 plotto overthrow Maduro.That failed plot, deemed the Bay of Piglets, was foiled by Venezuelan security forces.

No meetings have taken place and Amazon has yet to confirm anything.The report emerges days after the Dune and Arrival directorDenis Villeneuvewas announced as the first director of Bond’s new era under the Amazon-MGM banner. The French-Canadian film-maker, now working on the third Dune movie, reportedly beat out Conclave’s Edward Berger, Westworld’s Jonathan Nolan, Paddington’s Paul King and Shaun of the Dead’s Edgar Wright for the role.Gun for hire: what does Denis Villeneuve joining as director tell us about the new James Bond?Read more“I intend to honour the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come,” Villeneuve said in a statement. “This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honour.”Early rumours had suggested the Gravity director Alfonso Cuarón would step up, having worked with Bond’s new producer David Heyman before, but he removed himself from the race. Cuarón is set to work on the darkly funny dramaJanewith Charlize Theron instead.Holland, best known for playing Spider-Man, has also starred in the video game hit Uncharted and Apple series The Crowded Room. He’ll next be seen in Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey before returning for the fourth Spider-Man movie.The 29-year-old actor once tried to pitch a 007 spin-off to Sony. “I had a meeting after or during Spider-Man 2 with Sony to pitch this idea of a young Bond film that I’d come up with,”he said in 2022. “It was the origin story of James Bond. It didn’t really make sense. It didn’t work. It was the dream of a young kid, and I don’t think the Bond estate were particularly interested.”Dickinson, known for Triangle of Sadness and Babygirl, recently received rave reviews for his directorial debutUrchinat the Cannes film festival. “I mean, listen, man, you’d be a fool to not entertain that role,”he said when asked about playing Bond in 2023. “I’m loving seeing the development of James Bond and seeing how it changes over the years. I think Daniel Craig was such a good Bond that I’d almost be quite frightened to try … Who knows what they’re doing with Bond? I’m intrigued.”Elordi is the only Australian of the bunch, but could follow in the footsteps of George Lazenby who played Bond in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. The actor, best known for his role in TV drama Euphoria and Sofia Coppola’s Priscilla, will soon be seen in Emerald Fennell’s unconventional adaptation of Wuthering Heights with Margot Robbie.In 2023, Elordicalledrumours that he was being linked to the role “beautiful” and added: “I just like that people maybe want to put me in their movies. That makes me really glad.”The release date for the next film is yet to be announced, but Variety is claiming that anything sooner than 2028 would be impossible.The 26th Bond film will follow Daniel Craig’s final outing No Time to Die which made over $774m at the global box office. Earlier this year, ina reported $1bn deal, Amazon MGM bought the rights to gain “creative control” of the franchise.In March, producers Amy Pascal and David Heymanwere hiredto take charge of the new film.Explore more on these topicsJames BondDenis VilleneuveAmazonJacob ElordiTom HollandnewsShareReuse this content"

The government has placed them in expedited removal proceedings.Lawyers for the family say they were detained as part of the administration’s “nationwide campaign to summarily arrest law-abiding non-citizens when they attend their immigration court hearings”. Such arrests that are occurring at “rates never before seen in the United States”, according to the lawsuit filed this week. The lawsuit alleges the family is being detained in violation of their constitutional rights.The family applied to come to the US last year after fleeting their home country, where they faced “imminent, menacing death threats”. They followed the “lawful process”, were paroled and went to live with the woman’s mother, according to court documents provided by the Texas Civil Rights Project.The boy had been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the age of three and underwent two years of successful treatment. While no more leukemia cells were found in his blood, his mother knew he would need regular monitoring and medical care and took him to multiple appointments once they settled in the US, according to the suit.After attending a court hearing in Los Angeles last month, where their case was suddenly dismissed, federal agents dressed as civilians arrested the family “without any prior notice or warning” as they left the courtroom.They were not permitted to leave or make calls, the suit stated. The six-year-old, after seeing an agents gun, urinated on himself in fear and was left in the wet clothing for hours, according to the suit.Trump is jailing immigrant families again. A mother, father and teen tell of ‘anguish on a daily basis’Read moreThe family has been held ata detention center in Dilley, Texas, since their arrest. The six-year-old missed a medical appointment related to his diagnosis earlier this month because of the family’s incarceration.Detention has highly detrimental effects on the physical and mental health of children, potentially causing “serious psychological trauma”, and research has found that children at the Dilley facility suffer from “inadequate medical care”, according to the suit.The six-year-old has “lost his appetite, experienced easy bruising and occasional bone pain, and looks pale, all of which are recognized as symptoms of leukemia,” the suit states, and his mother fears he is not receiving necessary medical care. Both children cry every night.DHS official Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to the Guardian that the boy has received regular treatment while in custody.“First of all, at no time during detention is a detained individual denied emergency care,” said McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary. “Fortunately, the minor child in question has not undergone chemotherapy in over a year, and has been seen regularly by medical personnel since arriving at the Dilley facility.”“The implication that Ice would deny a child the medical care they need is flatly FALSE, and it is an insult to the men and women of federal law enforcement. Ice ALWAYS prioritizes the health, safety, and wellbeing of all detainees in its care.”Lawyers are requesting the family’s immediate release for medical treatment, and say that they are not a flight risk and have “done everything the government asked of them”.“The government is not detaining petitioners to serve its legitimate interests in protecting against danger or flight risk,” the court filing states. “Instead, the government is detaining this family, along with countless others swept up in its courthouse arrests, for the illegitimate reason that they were easy to locate because they were where DHS told them to be to pursue humanitarian relief.”The family is suing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the Department of Justice (DoJ) as well as the warden of the detention center, Ice’s acting director, the homeland security secretary, and the attorney general, among others.McLaughlin said the family “had chosen to appeal their case – which had already been thrown out by an immigration judge – and will remain in Ice custody until it is resolved”.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationCaliforniaLos AngelesWest CoastTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

The International Energy Agency estimates that datacentres’ total electricity consumption coulddouble from 2022 levelsto 1,000TWh (terawatt hours) in 2026, approximately Japan’s level of electricity demand. AI will result in datacentres using4.5% of global energy generationby 2030, according to calculations by the research firm SemiAnalysis.New UK AI datacentre could cause five times emissions of Birmingham airportRead moreThe report also raises concerns that the rapid evolution of AI may drive “non-linear growth in energy demand”, making future energy needs and emissions trajectories more difficult to predict.Another issueGooglehighlighted is lack of progress on new forms of low-carbon electricity generation. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), miniature nuclear plants that are supposed to be quick and easy to build and get on the grid, have been hailed as a way to decarbonise datacentres. There were hopes that areas with many datacentres could have one or more SMR and that would reduce the huge carbon footprint from the electricity used by these datacentres, which are more in demand due to AI use.Power grab: the hidden costs of Ireland’s datacentre boomRead moreView image in fullscreenA Google datacentre at Grange Castle, near Dublin.

While we continue to invest in promising technologies like advanced geothermal and SMRs, their widespread adoption hasn’t yet been achieved because they’re early-stage, relatively costly, and poorly incentivised by current regulatory structures.”It added that scope 3 remained a “challenge”, as Google’s total ambition-based emissions were 11.5m tons of CO₂-equivalent gases, representing an 11% year-over-year increase and a 51% increase compared with the 2019 base year. This was “primarily driven by increases in supply chain emissions” and scope 3 emissions increased by 22% in 2024.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

On both occasions, he returned to urban areas within weeks.Before his swim, he was spotted breaking into fishing boats at marinas to access bait and once stalked two walkers on a trail.“The people escaped by entering and remaining in the water for half an hour while the bear remained on shore circling back and forth,” the conservation service said.Despite his somewhat checkered past provincial officials said in a statement that there was a no “kill order” on Tex. But, they added, “if further behaviour by the grizzly bear occurs that threatens public safety, Conservation Officers will respond to those situations … It is our hope that it will not come to this, and the bear will move on independently.”Nicholas Scapillati, head of the Grizzly Bear Foundation said that such behaviour was to be expected for a young male bear.View image in fullscreenTexada Island in Canada is home to 1,200 residents and the one grizzly bear, who was last spotted just after sunset on 23 June.Photograph: Erich Schultz/Getty Images/500px“He’s on the move. He’s curious. He’s a young male out of hibernation who was likely pushed off out of his home range by his mom and is now looking for mates in a different genetic pool,” Scapillati said. “Now he’s just exploring.”But Tex’s presence on the island has sharply divided residents, unaccustomed to apex predators on their bucolic island.“They should euthanize him if they aren’t going to relocate him – he can’t stay here, someone is going to get injured/killed,” wrote one resident on a local Facebook message board. “It’s only a matter of time before something horrible happens. It’s shocking that some people think this isn’t a serious public safety issue.”But others argue the young bruin hasn’t harmed humans or livestock. Katrin Glenn-Bittner, a longtime resident of the island who has spotted the bear twice on her farm, has offered to help fund any relocation of the bear to a remote part of the province’s west coast. “There’s no future here for him on Texada Island, because he’s targeted, and if he makes a mistake – which may very well happen – he will be instantly destroyed,” she told the Globe and Mail.A First Nations community has offered to rehome the bear, but the request was rejected by the province’s conservation service, which said Tex’s “high level of conflict history” meant he was “not a candidate for relocation”.The Mamalilikulla First Nation says its Gwaxdlala/Nalaxdlala Indigenous Protected and Conserved Area (IPCA) in Knight Inlet, 100 miles north of Texada Island, would be the ideal home for the young bear.The IPCA was established in 2022 “based on the ancient concept of ‘Aweenak’ola’, which translates as ‘we are one with the land, sea and sky and supernatural Ones and have a responsibility to care for all the beings’”. And bringing the grizzly to the territory also aligns with the nation’s broader aim of restoring populations of a species they view as sacred.“Right now this grizzly bear is a ticking timebomb,” John Powell, elected chief of Mamalilikulla First Nation, told the Times Colonist. “I think inevitably the bear is going to run into a human or animal and it’s going to have a negative engagement. Texada is not a big place … It’s going to die there.”In 2019, British Columbia enacted legislation meant to harmonize its laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and it has signed a string of treaties or reconciliation agreements with nations in the province. The case of Tex represents a test of that new relationship, says Scapillati, whose foundation has worked with both First Nations and the province.In 2020, a male grizzly named Gatu appeared on the northern tip of Vancouver Island, and became too comfortable around humans. First Nations pleaded with conservation officers to come up with a proactive approach. Their request was ignored andthe bear was shot and killed. Months later, when another bear was spotted in the region, Mamalilikulla First Nationstepped in and requested it be moved. The young grizzly was successfully translocated to an area on the mainland. At the time, the province’s then minister of environment praised the result, saying the “desire for reconciliation” withIndigenous peopleshelped guide the process.“If First Nations want to look at how to handle these issues differently then the province has an obligation to talk to them and come up with a solution,” said Scapillati. “This request to translocate Tex is going to open up a whole discussion over how to balance the wildlife policies of various First Nations with the province’s wildlife policies,” he said. “It’s unique, it’s exciting – and it could be a gamechanger for wildlife stewardship in the province.”Biologists remain convinced the bear can be moved safely.“Having done field surveys of grizzly bear habitat surveys in the IPCA for the Mamalilikulla I can attest to the fact that the estuary is prime habitat for such a translocation at this time,” biologist Wayne McCrorywrote in a letter to the province. “Even given the possibility that the bear may not remain in the area if translocated again, I fully support … [the Mamalilikulla First Nation’’s] wishes to have the bear taken there.”McCrory said that while translocation doesn’t always work, the further a bear is moved from where it was captured, the better the odds of success.“I feel [not moving the bear] is a bad mistake that will only lead to the bear’s eventual demise, either [at the hands of conservation officers] or some local residents.”And while it has shaken residents, the bear’s arrival on the island also reflects a slow-moving success of conservation. In recent decades, populations of grizzly bears have rebounded dramatically thanks to a hunting ban and investment in stewardship.“Texada needs to get prepared. When you live in nature, bears are part of that. This is going to be a wake-up call for the community and all the other islands on the coast,” said Scapillati. “After years of work to recover populations, bears are on the move. And people need to get prepared to coexist with them.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentSeascape: the state of our oceansCanadaAnimalsAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How worried should we be about heat – and how can we stay safe as the climate changes?How many people die from heat?Hot weather kills an estimatedhalf a million peopleeach year. The average annual death toll is greater than that from wars or terrorism, but smaller than that from cars or air pollution.Despite this, heat is rarely listed as the cause of death. That’s because extreme temperatures are largely indirect killers. Most heat victims die early from illnesses – such as heart, lung and kidney disease – that are made worse in warm weather.How do heatwaves hurt your health?High heat stresses the human body. When days are too hot to function and nights are not cool enough to recover, the heart and kidneys go into overdrive working to keep the body cool.There are also secondary health effects from high heat. Heatwaves lead to more accidents, dirtier air, bigger wildfires and more frequent blackouts, all of which can increase the burden on health systems.Who is most at risk from extreme heat?People who are forced to be outdoors in scorching weather – builders, farmers, rough sleepers – are most likely to suffer from heat exhaustion and the heatstroke that can follow.But older people, and particularly those with underlying illnesses, make up the bulk of heat-related deaths. Women are more likely to die from heat-related causes than men. Poorer people – who are less likely to have air conditioning, well-insulated homes, or access to green spaces – are also at greater risk.Why does humidity make it feel hotter?Sweat is the body’s best defence against heat, lowering internal temperatures as it evaporates. But when humidity is high and the air hot and sticky, the body struggles to cool down because sweat clings to the skin. The effect this has on perceived temperatures can be several degrees Celsius, enough to spell the difference between life and death.Why are heatwaves getting hotter?More than a century’s worth of fossil fuel pollution has clogged the atmosphere, trapping sunlight and heating the whole planet. Average global temperatures have risen by about 1.3C since preindustrial times – and land temperatures by even more – which has pushed the baseline higher and made punishing extremes far more common.There is also some evidence that climate change is making heatwaves worse by weakening the jet stream. Scientists think this is increasing the occurrence of heat domes, areas of high pressure and heat that get stuck over a region for days or even weeks.Won’t climate change mean fewer people die from cold?Cold weather kills far more people than hot weather today, even in warm regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. But as temperatures rise, the number of deaths from heat is projected to grow much faster than the number of lives saved from milder cold. When scientists modelled this in 854 European cities, they found anet increasein temperature-related deaths under all emissions scenarios, even accounting for how people adapt.GraphHow can we adapt to heatwaves?Cutting fossil fuel pollution is the biggest step that can be taken to stop heatwaves from getting even hotter, along with protecting forests and wetlands that suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.Urban planners have also called for redesigning cities so they have less concrete and fewer cars, and more parks and water. This can negate the urban heat island effect, which makes cities hotter than their rural surroundings.Buildings with air conditioning or passive cooling can also bring down death tolls, as can strong healthcare systems and swift emergency warnings.How can I stay safe in a heatwave?The simplest advice is to stay out of the heat: avoid going outside during the hottest parts of the day, and stay in the shade if you have to. To keep your home cool, close windows during the day and open them after dark, when outdoor temperatures fall below inside temperatures. Cover windows with blinds or curtains to block out direct sunlight.Doctors also recommend drinking water frequently, wearing loose clothing and checking on vulnerable people in your community.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisUK weatherexplainersShareReuse this content"

She uses ice cores to reconstruct past conditions and predict future changes. She now leads several international Earth modelling projects.Why are theArcticand Antarctic regions important for the rest of the world?They are one of the pillars of global climate stability, a giant store of frozen water, an essential “biotic pump” that helps to store carbon, and an albedo shield that reflects much of the sun’s light and heat back out to space.View image in fullscreenLouise Sime says the idea of crossing an Antarctic tipping point is ‘beyond worrying’.Photograph: Tom Pilston/The GuardianWhen and why did scientists become concerned about tipping points inAntarctica?It has become a major talking point in the past five to 10 years, though the possibility has been known for much longer. Up until 2016, the sea ice in Antarctica seemed relatively stable. Then everything started to change. At first, the decline was mostly in line with climate models. But suddenly, in 2023, there was an enormous drop. About 2.5 million sq km of Antarctic sea ice went missing relative to the average before 2023. The anomaly was of such a magnitude that it’s quite hard for scientists to know what to make of it. It has been described as a five sigma event.What is a fivesigma event?Something that may only happen once in 10,000 years, or higher, possibly once in several million years. It was so far outside of expectations that the statistics became really hard to handle. It was very startling.What was the cause?It’s still not absolutely clear but it is probably associated with global warming and circulation changes in the oceans. In that year, there was an enormous atmospheric river event over East Antarctica, which was also a five sigma event. This coincided with the biggest heatwave on record, where we had a temperature anomaly in excess of 40C.What effect did this have on the region?When that much sea ice is lost, there are substantial knock-on impacts. While the ocean is covered by ice, the temperature above the surface can easily be -20C, -30C. But as soon as the water is exposed, then the surface temperature cannot go below -2C. And once the surface is opened to the atmosphere, then you start to get evaporation of water vapour. That means a sudden and substantial change of weather around Antarctica.What are the potential tipping points in the polar regions?Tipping points are broadly defined as abrupt changes that are irreversible, at least on human timescales. We know they are possible in polar ecosystems based on ice-core records going back 800,000 years. We are less sure where those tipping points are. That is because these regions are shaped by complex interactions. It also depends what scale we are talking about. Small, local tipping points may have already been passed on particular ice sheets or coastal ice shelves or possibly even sea ice. But it is less certain that the entire region is near a tipping point.View image in fullscreenThe collapse of ice shelves can remove the buttress on much bigger ice sheets, which can then slide into the ocean much faster, says Sime.Photograph: British Antarctic Survey/AFP/Getty ImagesWhat are ice sheets and why do they matter?Ice must cover at least 50,000 sq km of land to qualify as an ice sheet, also known as a continental glacier. They grow when there is more snow than melt-off, and shrink when there is more melt-off than snow or if they slide into the sea. We know this is a risk in Antarctica, because it’s got a backward sloping bedrock. If the ice there is thinned, then at some point it starts floating in deep basins and begins melting from below. Then you would have a sort of catastrophic collapse.How do they differ from iceshelves?Ice shelves are floating tongues of ice that flow out from land glaciers over a cold coastal ocean. They range in thickness from 50 to 600 metres, and help to buttress land ice. We’ve seen examples where they catastrophically collapse because melt water accumulates over the surface and forces cracks into the shelves. An ice shelf that may have been there for hundreds or thousands of years can collapse within months, possibly even weeks. By themselves, the collapse of ice shelves doesn’t add much to global sea-level rise, but it can remove the buttress on much bigger ice sheets, which can then slide faster into the ocean.West Antarctica appears to be the area of greatest concern. Why?This is the location of two huge and vulnerable glaciers: Pine Island and Thwaites. We know that their buttressing gate glaciers on the shore are thinning and retreating. That allows more of the ice sheet to flow into the ocean. Satellite images show this has been going on for some time and has accelerated at least since the year 2000.All of those glaciers are connected together so if they slipped into the ocean that would add about four metres to global ocean levels. But the key question is how long this will take. Looking at past records of change in Antarctica, it’s likely to take hundreds of years. But a very large acceleration would be felt almost immediately and it would result in the global sea level going up much, much faster in the near future.How does this comparewith the situation in the Arctic?The potential for Antarctica to increase global sea levels is scarier than for Greenland. Right now, they’re both contributing similar amounts to sea-level rise, but in future, it could be Greenland goes up a bit and then Antarctica goes up catastrophically.Greenland has the potential to raise sea levels by five or six metres, but we don’t expect this will come in the form of an absolutely catastrophic, abrupt loss. Most of the ice in Greenland is not below sea level so we can see what is happening and we expect it will melt in a linear fashion.By contrast, Antarctica has 80 metres of potential sea-level rise. We don’t expect all of that, but it is harder to know exactly what is happening. Much of Antarctica is below sea level and affected by the ocean, which means it is less stable and harder to observe. We also know there are parts of Antarctica where warm water is encroaching on to unstable shelves and we know that ice could retreat in some of the sloping basins – for example in East Antarctica and Wilkes Land. We don’t know where that tipping point is, but if we hit it, there will be an irreversible retreat of the West Antarctic sheet.Glacier viewed from above in 2001 and in 2019The amount of ice flowing from Antarctica’s Thwaites glacier – and contributing to sea level rise – has doubled in the span of three decades. Scientists think the glacier could undergo even more dramatic changes in the near future. These images demonstrates the changes since the start of this century. The first shows the glacier’s floating ice tongue on 2 December 2001 shortly before it calved Iceberg B-22. The second shows the glacier on 28 December 2019. Both images show the glacier where it exits the land in West Antarctica and stretches over the Amundsen Sea as thick floating ice.How longmay that take?It’s safer to assume that parts of it could happen rapidly. We know that ice shelves can collapse in a matter of weeks or months.On a bigger scale, evidence from the past suggests West Antarctica is unlikely to catastrophically lose all its ice in tens of years. It could unfold over hundreds or even thousands of years, but once you cross the tipping point and initiate that process, it is possible that we’d immediately see a substantial acceleration and jumps in sea level. We need more study.Is it possible that this is already under way?Yes. Some studies have suggested we may have passed tipping points, so the loss of the West Antarctic ice sheet may now be inevitable because of the warming of the oceans.However, this is far from clear. Tipping points definitely exist and we may already have passed some of the minor ones, but there’s also a good chance, in my view, that we haven’t yet crossed the major ones in Antarctica.What would happen elsewhere if the Antarctic breaches these tipping points?A huge proportion of the global population lives very close to the sea level so if the oceans rise by several metres, I find it personally quite hard to think about the consequences. They would be devastating.How would it affect the climate?A huge amount of the carbon dioxide that is emitted today is being sequestered in the Southern Ocean. But that only happens if ecosystems work effectively as a biological pump that draws carbon dioxide into the depths via plankton, krill and other species. If we cross tipping points in Antarctica, it would undermine that ecosystem. That would change the trajectory of how much carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere in the coming years, and likely increase global temperature, which will be felt by everyone.What is your gut feeling about whether we have crossed a tipping point in the Antarctic?It’s unthinkable, but it’s not impossible, and it looks more likely with each day that we continue burning fossil fuels. It’s beyond worrying.What difference would it make if we stopped burning oil, gas, coal and trees?If we stop emitting carbon tomorrow, then it’s quite likely that we would see no further decreases in Arctic sea ice. And it’s quite likely that other parts of the global climate system would immediately stabilise and temperatures would stop going up. So even if we had passed some tipping points, it’s very likely that we would not pass any others.View image in fullscreenSled dogs wading through standing water on the sea ice during an expedition in North Western Greenland.Photograph: Steffen Olsen/Centre for Ocean and Ice at the/AFP/Getty ImagesIs there any way to reverse what’s going on with a technological fix?Studies suggest geoengineering is speculative and could make things worse. I’m personally not against what-if modelling experiments: if we did have giant space mirrors, what would the climate of Earth look like at that point? But it’s unlikely in my personal view that any of them actually would be usable. They shouldn’t distract us from our primary goal which is to stop the burning of any fossil fuel as quickly as possible.How do you feel about the risk of a tipping point in the Antarctic?As a human being, I have so much trouble trying to think about the magnitude of the sea-level rise, that I’m not sure I have the capacity to really think it through. I really enjoy working on polar science generally. It’s a privilege, but I don’t really have a good answer for you. We scientists just do our best to encourage everyone to decarbonise, please, for my kids’ future, as well as for everyone else’s kids.Tipping points: on the edge? – a series on our futureView image in fullscreenComposite: Getty/Guardian DesignTipping points – in the Amazon, Antarctic, coral reefs and more – could cause fundamental parts of the Earth system to change dramatically, irreversibly and with devastating effects.

I had no idea – and my speechwriters didn’t know either. But that particular phrase – no, it wasn’t right. I’ll give you the honest truth: I deeply regret using it.”In the interview, he also talked about afirebomb attackon the door of his family home in London hours before the speech. However, he stressed he was not using the attack as an excuse for the language, or blaming his advisers, saying he himself should have paid more attention.Third-country asylum plan shows UK is in ‘a very dark place’, says Albanian PMRead moreHe also acknowledged there were “problems with the language” in his foreword to the policy document that said the record numbers of immigrants entering the UK under the last government had done “incalculable damage” to the country.He said it was the case thatLabourhad “become too distant from working-class people on things like immigration”, but he said: “This wasn’t the way to do it in this current environment.”In his speech in mid-May, Starmer said: “Let me put it this way: nations depend on rules, fair rules. Sometimes they are written down, often they are not, but either way they give shape to our values, guide us towards our rights, of course, but also our responsibilities, the obligations we owe to each other.“In a diverse nation like ours … we risk becoming anisland of strangers, not a nation that walks forward together.”Afterwards, several Labour MPs questioned whether Starmer’s policies were fuelling racism. Sarah Owen, the Labour chair of the women and equalities committee, who is of Malaysian-Chinese heritage, said: “Chasing the tail of the right risks taking our country down a very dark path. The best way to avoid becoming an ‘island of strangers’ is investing in communities to thrive, not pitting people against each other.”Nadia Whittome said anti-migrant rhetoric from the government was “shameful and dangerous”. The Labour MP for Nottingham East said: “To suggest that Britain risks becoming ‘an island of strangers’ because of immigration mimics the scaremongering of the far right.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A year into government in Westminster, Labour ison tricky ground. In Wales, where the party has led every government since devolution in 1999, polling suggests it will win its lowest ever vote share in next May’s Senedd election, trailing behind Plaid Cymru and Reform UK.“Every poll is a snapshot of a moment in time … but we do have a challenge on our hands,” Stevens said.The MP for Cardiff East, the most powerful Welsh politician in Westminster, is not from the capital: her parents, a metallurgist and a teacher, were from the Welsh valleys, but she was born in Swansea and grew up in Flintshire. Today she lives in Roath and her two grownup sons are out of the house.Stevens studied law at Manchester University and worked in trade union law for 20 years before standing in 2015 for the now-abolished seat of Cardiff Central. “Being a lawyer was good training for parliament, because as an MP you do a lot of casework,” she said. “I loved my job. You can change the law as a lawyer but it doesn’t happen very often. The only way you can really effect change is to go into parliament.“It took me ages to decide to go into politics but in the end it was an instinct, and I went for it.”After serving in Jeremy Corbyn’s and Keir Starmer’s shadow cabinets, including two stints as shadow secretary of state for Wales, in the 11 months since Labour swept into office in Westminster Stevens has had her best chance so far to make a difference.She can already point to a string of achievements: the minister is most proud of securing £21bn for Wales in the 2024 autumn budget – the largest settlement for Wales in real terms since devolution – and this month’s spending review, in which record funding for Wales’sneglected railwaysand forclearing dangerous coal tipswas announced.An offshore wind project in the Celtic Sea will bring thousands of badly needed jobs to Port Talbot and power millions of UK homes. Increased spending has allowed Eluned Morgan’s Welsh Labour government to bring down NHS waiting list times, which are worse than anywhere else in the UK, and will fund more police on the streets.Whether this will be enough to keep Welsh Labour in office next May remains to be seen. Unsurprisingly, Stevens has sharp words for Welsh opposition parties that have criticised Starmer’s government for not doing enough for Wales.“Plaid Cymru are the party of grievance,” she said. “You could give them the moon on a stick and they’d still complain. I don’t think they will be able to form a majority government. Wales has a choice next year between Eluned Morgan or Nigel Farage, because even if he’s not on the ballot, he will be calling the shots.”Yet Steven’s Welsh Labour colleagues are on edge. Morgan, who became first minister last August, cannot blame the Conservatives for failing to deliver, and there have beensigns of infightingbetween the administrations.Labour Senedd members have privately said they are agog at the fact that only five Welsh Labour MPs are rebelling against the UK government’s welfare bill, despite research showing it willdisproportionately affect people in Wales.Whether there is a serious disconnect between Cardiff and London should become apparent at this weekend’s conference. On Thursday Stevens pushed back against the rumours.“Eluned and I are friends,” Stevens said. “We don’t always agree, but we walk away from every conversation knowing I’ve got her back, and she’s got mine. She’s gone out and listened and decided the priorities for her government, and the UK government is working with her to deliver them. We are a team.”Stevens has just under a year to hope that what she can deliver for Wales makes a difference in the Senedd elections, and prove how well two Labour administrations can work together. If not, 100 years of the party’s dominance in Wales could be about to end.Explore more on these topicsWelsh politicsLabourWelsh governmentWalesEluned MorganReform UKPlaid CymruinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The plaintiffs claim Barclays downplayed the relationship even after the FCA launched its investigation, which centred on claims made in a letter it received from Barclays in October 2019.That letter claimed that Staley “did not have a close relationship” with Epstein and that his last contact with the financier had been “well before” he joined Barclays four years earlier in 2015. The FCA investigation, triggered by a cache of 1,200 emails from Staley’s former employer JP Morgan, concluded that the pair were“indeed close”and had a relationship that “went beyond one that was professional in nature”.The US lawsuit claims Barclays, Staley and Higgins misled them even after learning about the FCA investigation. They claim that this continued even after Barclays reviewed the JP Morgan email cache, which “demonstrated that the two men shared a much closer, personal relationship than defendants acknowledged to the FCA and the public”.View image in fullscreenNigel Higgins, the chair of Barclays, arriving to give evidence in March as Staley challenged his ban from the UK finance industry.The case has been brought by US shareholders and owners of American depository receipts (ADRs), which give investors the chance to own and trade shares in foreign companies on US stock exchanges.They claim they were ultimately defrauded, having learned about the true nature of Staley and Epstein’s relationship only after the FCA publicly released findings of its investigation and banned Staley from the Cityin October 2023. The news caused the value of their shares and ADRs to drop, resulting in “significant economic losses”.Staley hadresigned from Barclays two years earlier, in 2021, over preliminary findings from the FCA’s investigation.“When the FCA privately informed defendants of the outcome of its preliminary investigation, Staley left Barclays. Nevertheless, Barclays publicly continued to minimise the scope of the FCA’s investigation into Staley’s relationship with Epstein and voiced its support for its former CEO,” court filings by the plaintiffs state.That continued, they allege, after damaging details were revealed in a civil suit against JP Morgan, which was accused of banking Epstein while he was sex trafficking women and girls. While the cases were eventually settled, the class action says the evidence presented “further exposed correspondence between Staley and Epstein that publicly revealed their relationship was more than merely professional – contrary to the assurances defendants made to investors in Barclays securities”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Say hi to Snow White,” Staley wrote. “What character would you like next?” Epstein asked, to which Staley replied: “Beauty and the Beast.”The filing states: “When defendants’ deception of the FCA and investors was revealed, the price of Barclays securities again fell, and investors were further economically damaged.”The plaintiffs are suing Barclays, Higgins and Staley for an unspecified amount, saying they want compensation for “all damages sustained as a result of defendants’ wrongdoing, in an amount to be proven at trial, including interest”. They are also requesting that costs and expenses linked to the trial be covered, on top of “such other relief as the court may deem just and proper”.The first scheduling hearing in this US class action case, which will start setting out a timetable and deadlines for the legal process, is due to take place on 14 August.A legal representative for Staley declined to comment.

She is on a glucose drip in St Thomas’ hospital in London. The 69-year-old’s decision came after discussions with doctors and her family. She has been on hunger strike for more than 270 days to secure improvement inAbd el-Fattah’s jail conditionsor his release.The UK foreign secretary,David Lammy, told MPs this week he was confident that the UK strategy to secure Abd el-Fattah’s release was working, but did not give any further details to explain that view.In a readout of the Starmer phone call with Sisi, Downing Street said: “Turning to the bilateral relationship between the UK andEgypt, the leaders underscored the potential to go further and faster on trade and investment to benefit both countries. The prime minister also raised the case of British national Alaa Abd el-Fattah and again pressed for his release so that he can be reunited with his family.”The fact that the British readout seemed to link improved trade ties to Abd el-Fattah’s release hinted at an effort to persuade Sisi that it would be in Egypt’s economic interest to permit the release of the British-Egyptian dual national.It is the third phone call the UK prime minister has made to the Egyptian president in which he has raised the award-winning writer’s imprisonment.In the Egyptian version of the call, “the two leaders emphasised the two countries’ keenness on enhancing their bilateral relations across various fields, particularly in the economic and investment spheres”.Starmer said he looked forward to Sisi’s acceptance of the invitation, extended from the king, to visit London. For his part, Sisi confirmed the invitation extended to the British prime minister to visit Egypt later this year.The two leaders also discussed a Gaza ceasefire. No mention of Abd el-Fattah was made in the Egyptian statement.View image in fullscreenLaila Soueif, the mother of Alaa Abd el-Fattah (photographed here in November 2024), is now in a critical condition in hospital after more than 270 days on hunger strike.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianSome MPs have been calling for the Foreign Office to change its travel advice in a bid to threaten the Egyptian economy with the loss of UK tourist income, but there has been tension inside the Foreign Office over whether threats or incentives will persuade Egypt’s authoritarian leader that continued detention is damaging the Egyptian national interest.Laila Soueif, on 247th day of hunger strike for jailed British-Egyptian son, defiant in face of deathRead moreSoueif, a university professor and long-term campaigner for human rights in Egypt, has beenin and out of hospitalsince she started her hunger strike, but her health has become critical over the past three weeks as her blood glucose levels dropped.Her daughter Sanaa Seif, posting on Facebook on Wednesday, said her mother might be facing long-term mobility issues, and had fallen twice the day before. Seif wrote: “She was not sure she knows how to stand on her legs again and at her age it is hard to build muscle … The signs of course were very scary and mama was forced to use the wheelchair again.”Soueif has again agreed to a small glucose intake to improve her blood sugar levels. She continues to take no food.The Labour MP Stella Creasy asked Lammy on Tuesday to give an assurance all options were being considered, including changing the travel advice to Egypt.The foreign secretary replied: “This case and Laila’s condition has concerned me greatly. It has been a top priority every week I have been in office: at every single level – prime minister, foreign secretary, foreign minister and national security adviser – we are engaged with the Egyptians. I believe our strategy is working, but given Laila’s health we must see progress at pace with the Egyptians.”Abd el-Fattah was arrested in September 2019, after he had already served five years for the so-called Shura council protest in November 2013 when dozens of activists were detained for demonstrating against military trials. In December 2021, after more than two years in detention, he was sentenced again – this time to five more years, accused of spreading false news for reposting a tweet about a detainee who died as a result of his torture in prison.Explore more on these topicsEgyptKeir StarmerDavid LammyMiddle East and north AfricaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

And we have held that those rights are violated by government policies that substantially interfere with the religious development of children.”At the end of Alito’s judgment, the ruling stated: “Until all appellate review in this case is completed, the [school] board should be ordered to notify [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction.”The ruling prompted a fierce dissent from the liberal justice Sonya Sotomayor, who said that public education was intended to be a unifying experience for children and “the most pervasive means for promoting our common destiny”.But she added that concept would become “a mere memory” if pupils were “insulated from exposure to ideas and concepts that may conflict with their parents’ religious beliefs”.The ruling comes against awidespread conservative backlashin public schools and public libraries across many places in the US, but especially Republican-run parts of the country. The backlash has often sought to remove books that social conservatives find objectionable – often those that involve depictions of LGBTQ+ themes or racial inequality.US supreme court rules key provision of Obamacare constitutionalRead moreTheAmerican Library Associationestimates there are at least 112 proposed state laws concerning schools and public libraries that seek to expand the definition of what is deemed obscene or harmful to children and to limit librarian staff’s ability to determine which books they hold in their collections.In a statement, Catholics for Choice, which opposes the court’s ruling, said: “The Supreme Court decided that it is okay for parents to teach their children to discriminate and judge people who are different than them.”Taylor Tuckerman, a CfC vice-president, said: “It’s also important for children to learn that our differences – religion, sexual orientation, gender expression, race, economic backgrounds, and more – contribute to a thriving community and are not something to be ashamed of.”Explore more on these topicsUS supreme courtLGBTQ+ rightsTransgenderChildrenSchoolsUS educationLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.If convicted on all counts, hecould face up to life in prison.Closing arguments begin in Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sex-trafficking trialRead moreThroughout the trial and again in closing arguments, Combs’s legal teamacknowledged past incidents of domestic violence, but maintained thatall sexual encounters were consensualand part of what they described as a “swingers lifestyle”. The defense has denied that Combs committed sex trafficking and have said that nocriminal conspiracy existed.“We own the domestic violence, I hope you guys know that,” Agnifilo told the jury on Friday. “It happened. That’s not charged. He did not do the things he is charged with.”Framing Combs as a successful businessman, Agnifilo described his client as a “self-made, successful, Black entrepreneur” who built “wonderful, sophisticated, real businesses that have stood the test of time”.Throughout the trial, the defense has sought to portray two women at the heart of the case–singer Casandra “Cassie” Venturaand a woman testifying under the pseudonym“Jane”–as willing and consenting participants in the sex parties, which were often referred to as “freak-offs”.Both Ventura and Jane testified during the trial that they werecoercedby Combs to participate in the drug-fueled “freak-offs” that they said Combs directed, watched, masturbated to and sometimes filmed.They also described instances of physical abuse, and alleged that Combs wouldthreatento releaseexplicit videosof them or cut off financial support if they defied him.In his closing, Agnifilo challenged witness accounts, pushed back on the government’s allegations, and disputed the prosecution’s portrayal of Ventura and Jane as sex-trafficking victims.Agnifilocast Ventura, the government’s star witness, as a woman with agency, rather than a victim.He pointed to the $20m settlement she received from Combs in 2023 after filing a civil lawsuit accusing him of abuse, which triggered the federal investigation. He also pointed to the $10m Ventura is expected to receive from the owner of a hotel in Los Angeles where she was assaulted by Combs in 2016.“If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it’s hard not to pick Cassie,” Agnifilo said. “This isn’t about a crime, this is about money.”At one point during closing, Agnifilo seemed to mock the government’s2024 raidson Combs’s homes, during which investigators reportedly seized more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant.“Boxes of Astroglide, taken off the streets, whoo! I feel better already,” Agnifilo said sarcastically. “Way to go, fellas.”Agnifilo also criticized the racketeering charge, saying no one else was charged alongside Combs and that no witness testified to being part of a criminal enterprise.He closed his argument by urging the jury to acquit Combs.“He is not a racketeer. He is none of these things. He is innocent,” Agnifilo said. “Return him to his family who have been waiting for him.”Combs’s six adult children were present in court on Friday, as was his mother.Agnifilo’s closing argument lasted about four hours.The government then gave a one-hour rebuttal, which is the final step before the case goes to the 12-member jury to decide Combs’s fate.In their rebuttal, prosecutors claimed that the defense spent a “whole lot of energy” during the closing argument trying to blame Combs’s “victims and the US government” for Combs’s “lies, his threats and for his inexcusable behavior”.The judge said on Friday that the jury will begin deliberations on Monday.Outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan on Friday, some demonstrators gathered in support of sexual assault survivors.The protest was organized by gender justice group UltraViolet.In a statement, Elisa Batista, the campaign director at UltraViolet said: “We are here for the brave men and women who testified in the Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs trial, sharing harrowing stories of systemic and violent abuse, as well as those who weren’t able to.”“No matter the verdict in this trial, survivors still have power,” she said. “And when we stand together, accountability is achievable.”Prosecution and defense rest case in Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sex-trafficking trialRead moreOn Thursday, the government presented its own closing argument, with Christy Slavikspending nearly five hoursoutlining the government’s case against the music mogul.The US attorney described Combs as “the leader of a criminal enterprise” who refused to “take no for an answer” and as someone who wielded “power, violence and fear to get what he wanted”.“The defendant was a very powerful man,” she said. “But he became more powerful and more dangerous because of the support of his inner circle and his businesses – the enterprise.”Slavik walked the jury through the weeks of testimony and evidence the government presented over the course of seven weeks.“Up until today, the defendant was able to get away with these crimes because of his money, his power, his influence,” she said. “That stops now. It’s time to hold him accountable. It’s time for justice. It’s time to find the defendant guilty.”Jurors also heard for the first time on Thursday about allegations that Combs engaged in witness tampering and obstruction – part of the broader racketeering charge – with regards to “Jane” and another woman, who testified under the pseudonym “Mia”.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsNew YorkSex traffickingUS crimeHip-hopRapnewsShareReuse this content"

That number is projected to rise to 435 million, or nearly 60% of the world’s extreme poor, by 2030.”The number of deaths in wars and conflicts across the world was stable before the 2008 banking crisis, which forced many developing countries to cut back welfare and education programmes to pay for rising debt payments.The report said the average number of such fatalities was about 50,000 between 2000 and 2004 and even lower between 2005 and 2008, but then there was an increase to more than 150,000 in 2014. Since the pandemic the number of deaths in conflict has averaged 200,000, reaching more than 300,000 in 2022.“For the last three years, the world’s attention has been on the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and this focus has now intensified,” said Indermit Gill, the World Bank Group’s chief economist.“Yet more than 70% of people suffering from conflict and instability are Africans. Untreated, these conditions become chronic. Half of the countries facing conflict or instability today have been in such conditions for 15 years or more. Misery on this scale is inevitably contagious.”He said of the 39 economies currently classified as facing conflict or instability, 21 are in active conflict.Several major donors to investment programmes across the developing world have reduced their funding in recent years, including the UK and the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, in economies facing conflict or instability the rate is nearly 40%.The 39 countries have a rate of national income per head of $1,500 (£1,282) a year, “which has barely budged since 2010 – even as GDP per capita has more than doubled to an average of $6,900 in other developing economies,” the report said.Joining the army of local militia can also be an attractive option for young men and women. In 2022, the latest year for which such data was available, more than 270 million people were of working age in these economies, yet fewer than half were employed.“The global community must pay greater attention to the plight of these economies,” said M Ayhan Kose, the World Bank Group’s deputy chief economist.“Jumpstarting growth and development here will not be easy, but it can be done – and it has been done before.

As is commonplace at the group’s shows, Kneecap displayed a message stating: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,” and the words “Fuck Israel. Free Palestine”. Mo Chara, one of the group’s members, told the audience: “The Palestinians have nowhere to go. It’s their fucking home and they’re bombing them from the skies. If you’re not calling it a genocide, what the fuck are you calling it?”Within a week, Kneecap’s US booking agent had dropped them, Fox News had likened the statements to “Nazi Germany”, a handful of summer shows had been cancelled, and two videos from 2023 and 2024 had resurfaced of the group on stage saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory,” and “Up Hezbollah, up Hamas”. The former statement attracted criticism from the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and David Amess, leading the band to apologise – “we never intended to cause you hurt” – and to reject “any suggestion that we would seek to incite violence against any MP or individual”. While saying “we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah”, they also described the recirculation of the videos as a “smear campaign” against them, with the footage “deliberately taken out of all context”.British counter-terrorism police announced they were investigating the band over alleged pro-terrorist sentiment expressed in the video, and later charged Mo Chara with terror offences for allegedly brandishing the flag of Hezbollah – which in the UK is a proscribed terrorist organisation – after someone from the crowd handed it to him during a November 2024 London show. In response, artists including Massive Attack, Paul Weller and Primal Scream signed a letter advocating for free speech and alleging that Kneecap were victims of a “campaign of intimidation”.Two months after Coachella, and as they prepare for a Glastonbury festival appearance that has been criticised by among others, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, and the leader of the Commons, Lucy Powell, the band say they are unfazed by the uproar. “Maybe visas get revoked, you’re not allowed in America again, it’s not ideal – but Jesus Christ, there’s people being bombed from the fucking skies, and people being starved to death,” says Mo Chara, AKA Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh. “We’re in the process [of applying for new visas], hopefully it works. But if it doesn’t, I can go about my day without having to worry about my next meal or my family being bombed. Visa revoked, I can get over.”View image in fullscreenMo Chara (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh) leaving Westminster magistrates court on 18 June.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Getty ImagesDo the band regret what’s depicted in either of the widely circulated videos? “It’s ajoke. I’m acharacter. Shit is thrown on stage all the time. If I’m supposed to know every fucking thing that’s thrown on stage” – in this case a Hezbollah flag – “I’d be in Mensa, Jesus Christ,” says Ó hAnnaidh. “I don’t know every proscribed organisation – I’ve got enough shit to worry about up there. I’m thinking about my next lyric, my next joke, the next drop of a beat.”And the “dead Tory” comments? “Why should I regret it? It was a joke – we’re playing characters, it’s satirical, it’s afucking joke. And that’s not the point,” he says. “The point is, that [video] wasn’t an issue until we said ‘Free Palestine’ at Coachella. That stuff happened 18 months ago, and nobody batted an eyelid. Everybody agreed it was a fucking joke, even people that may have been in the room that didn’t agree – it’s a laugh, we’re all having a bit of craic. The point is, and the context is, it all [resurfaced] because of Coachella. That’s what we should be questioning, not whether I regret things.”Kneecap’s opponents, he says, “went and combed through eight years of a career … they’re really scraping the bottom of the barrel”. He says that they then “took those videos out of context. If you believe that what a satirical band who play characters on stage do is more outrageous than the murdering of innocent Palestinians, then you need to give your head a fucking wobble.”To suggest that parts of Kneecap’s performance are satire and others aren’t is a tricky and potentially confusing line to walk. But Ó hAnnaidh argues the band don’t risk undermining their activism by blurring these lines. “It’s not our job to tell people what’s a joke and what’s not. Our job is: we make music as a band. We are going to have political messaging in our songs – it’s not for us to dissect it for other people. Take what you want from it, but we’re not going to change in that way.”Kneecap have granted only one interview prior to their Glastonbury performance, and over the course of an hour-long video call – Ó hAnnaidh, and DJ Próvai, AKA JJ Ó Dochartaigh, speaking from Lurgan, and Móglaí Bap, AKA Naoise Ó Cairealláin, from his home in Belfast – all stay staunchly on message. The controversy surrounding them, they reiterate, is not the story – Gaza is. “We’re a distraction, to take away [attention] from what’s happening in Palestine, especially for our generation of people who are always on our phones,” says Ó Cairealláin. “It’s all being livestreamed – you can never say you didn’t know what’s happening in Palestine, and that’s why they want to bog us down and go through old videos. Over 100 people were killed in the last four days – that’s the real story.” He alleges that the US and the UK “are complicit in this genocide” on the grounds that each country has sent military supplies to Israel, and that Israel’s supporters are targeting the band because they want to move the news “away from the arms support”.View image in fullscreenKneecap at the Bowery Ballroom in New York, October 2023.Photograph: Rolling Stone/Getty ImagesKneecap say that resistance is in their blood. Ó hAnnaidh and Ó Cairealláin are from west Belfast, while Ó Dochartaigh is from Derry; rapping in Irish is a way, they say, to reclaim a sense of Irish identity that the British attempted to stamp out. While they satirically self-identify as “Republican hoods” and “Fenian cunts” in their cartoonish, lewd music, their message is less republican than it is anticolonial and anti-sectarian. Kneecap advocate for peace between unionists and republicans – “the people on the ‘other side’ aren’t our enemy … we’re all working-class”, Ó hAnnaidhtold the Facelast year – and train their fury towards the 800 years of British rule in Ireland.Because of this, as well as their frequent references to drugs, the group have been criticised by unionist and republican advocates alike, as well as by Kemi Badenoch last year, who, when serving as UK business secretary, tried to block Kneecap from receiving a government-funded Music Export Growth Scheme grant because they “oppose the United Kingdom”.Kneecap won a subsequent discrimination lawsuitagainst the British government, and donated the grant money to Protestant and Catholic youth organisations in Northern Ireland. This week, the band released The Recap, a furious, gloating diss track aimed at Badenoch, in which they describe the grant money as reparations.The Recap – KneecapIt was around the time Kneecap sued the government that they caught the attention of Hasan Piker, a streamer and political commentator who the New York Times recently termed “a Joe Rogan of the left” due to his enormous platform and influence (he is one of the most viewed streamers on Twitch). He describes Kneecap to me as “uncompromising and unyielding in their commitment to anti-imperialism”. After it was announced that Kneecap’s second Coachella set wouldn’t be livestreamed, he offered to stream the show on his Twitch channel, which has more than2.9m followers. “I’m always impressed when I see anyone in the western world share this kind of sentiment,” he says. “At no point did I feel like they were fearful or anything like that … their advocacy is about putting humanity first.”Kneecap’s rise has been steady since they debuted in 2017, and was bolstered by last year’s release of a self-titled Bafta-winning comedy film about their origins, starringMichael Fassbender and the group themselves. Politics aside, the music itself is a riot: bawdy and whip-smart, animated by ferocious beats, deftly slipping between trenchant political commentary and dazed odes to the joys of substance use.But it’s their anticolonial stance that has secured them legions of fans in places such as Aotearoa (New Zealand) and Australia, where they played to 10,000 fans at a free gig in Melbourne earlier this year. That stance is also why the band advocate so fiercely for Palestine, which they say they have been doing since they began making music. “Eight-hundred years of colonialism, it obviously does things to people up to the point where I don’t think the Irish people are willing to stand on the sidelines any more. The Irish people aren’t willing to let something like a genocide pass by without comment,” says Ó hAnnaidh, and in general, Irish artists – Kneecap, as well as peers such as Lankum, Fontaines DC and Sprints – have been more vocal about the Palestinian cause than British or American acts. “If we lose a few quid, we lose a bit of clout in a certain space, we don’t care – we know we’re doing the right thing, we know we’re on the right side of history.”Israel has been carrying out a full-scale military campaign on occupied Gaza for almost two years, an onslaught triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed. The UN has found Israel’s military actions to be consistent with genocide, while Amnesty International and others have claimed Israel has shown an “intent to destroy” the Palestinian people.At least 56,000 Palestiniansare now missing or dead, with studies at Yale and other universities suggesting the official tolls are being underestimated. (In July 2024,the Lancet medical journal estimatedthe true death toll at that point could be more than 186,000.) But away from Kneecap and other outspoken artists, across the creative industries as a whole relatively few have spoken about Gaza in such stark terms.“The genocide in Palestine is a big reason we’re getting such big crowds at our gigs, because we are willing to put that message out there,” says Ó hAnnaidh. “Mainstream media has been trying to suppress that idea about the struggle in Palestine. People are looking at us as, I don’t know, a beacon of hope in some way – that this message will not be suppressed. The music is one thing, but the message is a big part of why we’re getting across.”As working-class, early-career musicians, Kneecap have a lot more to lose by speaking out than more prominent artists, but Ó Cairealláin says this is beside the point. “You can get kind of bogged down talking about the people who aren’t talking enough or doing enough, but for us, it’s about talking about Palestine instead of pointing fingers,” he says. “There’s no doubt that there’s a lot of bands out there who could do a lot more, but hopefully just spreading awareness and being vocal and being unafraid will encourage them.”View image in fullscreenKneecap.Photograph: Peadar Ó GoillÓ Dochartaigh adds: “We just want to stop people being murdered. There’s people starving to death, people being bombed every day. That’s the stuff we need to talk about, not fucking artists.”There’s no doubt that Kneecap’s fearlessness when it comes to speaking about Palestine is a key part of their appeal for many: during a headline set at London’sWide Awake festival last month, days after Ó hAnnaidh was charged for support of a terror organisation, an estimated 22,000 people chanted along with their calls of “free, free Palestine”. And thousands showed up to their Coachella sets – which the band allege is why so many pro-Israel groups were quick to push back on them, despite the fact that they had been displaying pro-Palestine messages for such a long time.“We knew exactly that this was going to happen, maybe not to the extreme [level] that it has, but we knew that the Israeli lobbyists and the American government weren’t going to stand by idly while we spoke to thousands of young Americans who agree with us,” says Ó hAnnaidh. “They don’t want us coming to the American festivals, because they don’t want videos of young Americans chanting ‘free Palestine’ [even though] that is the actual belief in America. They just want to suppress it.”The support for the message, says Ó Dochartaigh is “all genders, all religions, all colours, all creeds. Everybody knows what’s happening is wrong. You can’t even try to deny it now – Israel’s government is just acting with impunity and getting away with it. Us speaking out is a small detail – it’s the world’s governments that need to do something about it.”Last week, Ó hAnnaidh made an appearance at Westminster magistrates court, during which he was unconditionally bailed with a hearing set for 20 August. Kneecap’s defence team, which includes criminal defence lawyer Gareth Peirce, who represented the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, has argued that the charge against Ó hAnnaidh was made after the six-month period in which such a terrorism offence would fall under the court’s jurisdiction.Hundreds of protesters – including Paul Weller – gathered at the entrance to the court, holding aloft Palestine flags and signs that said “Free Mo Chara”; a van, emblazoned with the slogan “More Blacks, More Dogs, More Irish, Mo Chara,” circled the block periodically. Rob and Kathleen, an older couple from Hayling Island, had shown up to “defend free speech, to support people who protest about genocide in Gaza,” said Rob. “We’re also here to support young people,” Kathleen added. “Old people have made a real mess of this world, and we are very sorry, and hopefully young people can get us out of this mess.”When asked by the BBC on Wednesday about Kneecap’s appearance at Glastonbury, festival organiser Emily Eavis said “we remain a platform for many, many artists … everyone is welcome here”. But there is still considerable opposition to their Saturday afternoon set. Earlier this week, Starmer said it wasn’t “appropriate” for the band to perform at the festival, while Badenoch said the BBC “should not be rewarding extremism” by televising the band’s set. (A BBC spokesperson told the Guardian that “whilst the BBC doesn’t ban artists, our plans will ensure that our programming will meet our editorial guidelines”.)How Northern Irish rap trio Kneecap rose to fame by subverting the TroublesRead moreAnd, earlier in the month, a leak exposed a letter sent to the organisers of Glastonbury in which a number of music industry heavyweights ask the festival to “question the wisdom of continuing to have [Kneecap] on the lineup”. The letter was signed by top agents from major live music agencies.​ That the letter wasn’t published publicly is a form of vindication for the trio, says Ó Cairealláin.“The fact that the letter was leaked changes things,” adds Ó hAnnaidh. “And I hope that these people regret it. I think they’re already starting to.”Kneecap play Glastonbury’s West Holts stage at 4pm on Saturday.This article was amended on 27 June 2025.

So yes Tom Hardy immediately springs to mind. I also think Tom Hiddleston would be good at a more lighter touch Bond though, the Roger Moore to Hardy’s Connery. All the other candidates either sound way to young or in the case of Idris Elba, great actor though he is, a bit old for the role.machineheadGun for hire: what does Denis Villeneuve joining as director tell us about the new James Bond?Read moreWhilst Idris and Tom Hardy would undoubtedly have been excellent – Tom Hardy, in particular, has that undercurrent of menace that Connery always carried – as, I think, would Christian Bale, their time has passed. I did think Nicholas Hoult might be a reasonable pick, though possibly too “pretty”. But were I casting it, my money would go on Jack O’Connell: right age, English, dashing and could probably do rugged, thuggish violence if SAS Rogue Heroes is any guide.EvanByrne2Ten years ago I’d have said Tom Hardy was a gimme, I think he still has the action chops for it, but is now over 50 so … Norton as the first ginger Bond? I reckon he’s a good shout, Richard Madden and Kit Harington have also got to be in with a shout having both done pretty well in spy caper action roles before.DezzyDiscoJack O’Connell. Very impressed with his Paddy Mayne in SAS Rogue Heroes. The right blend of charm and danger.JudeScorpioI never would have believed that I would ever have typed the names James Bond and Eddie Redmayne in the same sentence. It would have been a bit like suggesting Kenneth Williams should on the shortlist. However, Mr Redmayne was chillingly good in The Jackal and he would be a very different kind of cold and calculating Bond.NigeleastsussexView image in fullscreenNoomi Rapace.Photograph: Willy Sanjuan/Invision/API think the next one needs to be JANE BOND. Since fact is stranger than fiction, there are plenty of real life examples of heroic women of the cold war intelligence/espionage world, from which an excellent writer can draw upon. An exemplary performance was provided by Noomi Rapace in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009). Consider the economic success of the Wonder Woman movies – which may be difficult for Bezos to grasp.NotACustomerDefinitely James Norton. He has the looks, the acting skills and experience and would be perfect as the next 007.christinen101No more Bonds, for Heaven’s sake! They lost the plot, over-hyped the character, killed any humour or charm and turned Bond into some kind of American action cartoon. Just watch Dr No or something and move on.fabcat21Matthew Goode. I have nothing to add.RiotsnotdietsHugh Laurie, obviously. He can play anything, especially upper-class Englishmen who can morph into convincing Americans when required.ErbiumBoris Kodjoe! Handsome, tall, fit, wryly funny, and a pretty decent actor.KnowitallieView image in fullscreenTom Ellis.Photograph: null/2017 Warner Bros. Ent. All rights reserved. TM & © DC Comics.I quite like the idea of Tom Ellis. He would be smooth after Daniel Craig’s more gritty performance. I guess more in the Roger Moore range. But with Denis Villeneuve in the director’s chair not sure it would work. Tom Hiddleston would also make a good choice.MillyTantI think George MacKay (1917) would make a great Bond. He’s got that look that mixes vague meanness with woolly competence, so he could fit all kinds of different scenarios. Trying to replace Daniel Craig (RIP) with another toughie street fighter would be too easy. I think MacKay also adds a spoonful of the eccentric enigmatic, would make him tough to pin down but still quite vulnerable.studious1Tom Hiddleston. Another visceral actor would just look shite compared to Craig so I would go for a more cerebral Bond but with enough gravitas to stop it looking like a parody (unlike Brosnan).FeedTheEnemyChris Hemsworth might be a good option. Depends if they want to go hardcore like Craig’s Casino Royale or if they want to ham it up like Roger Moore’s tenure.TheMrGafferView image in fullscreenJack Lowden.Photograph: Matt Baron/BEI/Rex/ShutterstockJack Lowden would be a good shout. I’d like to see the role reclaimed for Scotland.mikebhoyTom Hiddleston, after seeing his work as Jonathan Pine in The Night Manager. Smooth with a sinister edge.DewinDwlRobert Pattinson. He played a suave agent in Tenet. He’s got the looks, the charisma, the elegance. BTW my solution to the reboot problem is to take a leaf from The Man With the Golden Gun’s book (literally, from the book). Bond has lost his memory (so no need to include his new family from No Time To Die). He also suffered burns in the explosion and has had to have plastic surgery so, cough, he looks completely different. But we get to keep his found family of SIS team members who I love – Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris and Ralph Fiennes.catwhowalksbyitselfHow about Matthew Macfadyen? He can do the upper-class British thing, but after seeing him be a real asshole in Succession I think he can do just about anything.kirkmc1View image in fullscreenṢọpẹ́ Dìrísù.Photograph: Susie Allnutt/Sky UK/Pulse FilmsMy pick would be Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù, he has the action stuff, he has the acting chops; just check out the first few episodes of Gangs of London for the audition tape.RichlieuLike the idea of Tom Hardy; Idris – maybe a little too old? Don’t know? Am I being ageist here? I see someone has mentioned James Norton – he has great charisma and range.JojoSumTom Hardy is probably too old now, as he’s pushing 50. Proper reboot territory should have Bond mid to late 30s. Theo James is a good call, he’s already done the “posh hardman” routine in The Gentlemen, like Craig, who basically got the gig after his turn in Layer Cake.OwlyrossRegé-Jean Page is the obvious contender. He has a solid fanbase but is not yet typecast, and has a fluidity that would enable the role to be reimagined without changing 007 completely and alienating diehards. Not exactly unknown of course.Estella1960View image in fullscreenDan Stevens.Photograph: Erin Simkin/HULUDan Stevens would be my choice. About the right age, looks the part and can prove experience in both action and comedy. And he did an excellent film a few years back called The Guest where he played a steely-eyed murderous bastard to perfection. Sadly he’s one of those “tipped for big things a decade ago” actors who might be regarded as a bit of a yesterday’s man for such a high-profile role these days (although he’s done fine work since).KevcoeI would personally go for Jack O’Connell as an outside bet. It won’t happen of course. And he’s a bit short, but so was Craig. But he definitely has the charisma and the acting chops to pull it off.LazygunnAs a longtime fan of the Bond franchise, I’m surprised that one actor’s name hasn’t come up in casting speculation, and that is Tom Weston-Jones, who I first became aware of via his starring role in Copper. After just a couple of episodes, I thought from the intensity he projected, especially with his eyes, that he would make a great James Bond.Creative_ConquestExplore more on these topicsJames BondTom HardyJack O'ConnellIdris ElbaHugh LaurieTom HiddlestonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But if you can get on board with the twists – and that’s a big if – you will not believe what happens in the last minuteRebecca NicholsonFri 27 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 05.08 EDTShareThe two main talking points of the third and final season ofSquid Gameare both massive spoilers. This means that I won’t be able to mention the final minute of the whole thing, which contains a moment so WTF and genuinely surprising that I bet my editor a serious amount of money she wouldn’t be able to guess what happens. She couldn’t, thankfully, but such reckless gambling is the sort of behaviour that would land me in Squid Game in the first place, so it just shows that nobody here has learned any lessons from it whatsoever.Nor should I talk about another key development, though in this case, it becomes so central that it needs to be mentioned somehow. So, vaguely speaking, a new player is forced to enter the games, without being capable of giving their consent, and becomes the focus of later episodes. It is odd to criticise Squid Game for not being credible, given that it is a hit show about an underground tournament in which children’s games are played until many or most of the participants die, but introducing this new player is completely out there, even by the standards of “hide-and-seek … but with knives?”‘People like happy endings. Sorry!’ Squid Game’s brutal finale hits new heights of barbarityRead moreSquid Game is a bona fide phenomenon and a noticeable dip in quality after season one has done little to dent viewers’ enthusiasm.The second seasonended in a bloodbath –or a bigger bloodbath than usual– but for the most part it felt like a slow and messy buildup to the big finale. The third season, which wraps up the story, suggests that splitting it up was unnecessary, at least in terms of momentum. The two halves could have made a tight single season, but in this drawn-out state it remains loose around the edges.Season three picks up exactly where we left off. The revolution has been neutralised and 60 players have been left alive to continue competing for the big plastic piggy full of blood money. Player 456, Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), is rendered all but mute by the horrors of the quashed uprising, which means the main character doesn’t say much for a lot of the early episodes. The brutality has grown, the violence is a relentless grind, and the satire has ebbed away. More and more of the remaining contestants are just bloodthirsty, terrible people who kill without conscience. It is a spectacle, sure, but it’s nowhere near as pointed as it was.View image in fullscreenThe revolution has been neutralised … Jo Yuri as Jun-hee in Squid Game season three.Photograph: ./NetflixTake the voting. The competition’s commitment to the democratic process means that before every game, the surviving players must take a vote on whether to continue to fight for their lives and a bigger prize pot, or whether to walk away and split the spoils. The VIPs, those mega-wealthy spectators who pay to watch the games while wearing bejewelled animal masks and who make it feel like a considerably inferior show whenever they appear, frequently chip in with meta-level commentary about what is unfolding. One of them declares that watching the players vote on whether to go on is more interesting than the games.Reader, it is not. Some people want to go home. Most people want to carry on playing. This debate has happened before and it happens again. It leaves insufficient room for the games themselves. I find myself desperate for them to get back to the business of ultra-violent child’s play, urging them to find a way to make conkers, let’s say, into some fatal showdown. (They do not play conkers.) There are three games left to play out, but none of them feel as well thought through as the first season’s challenges. I suspect that is why it struggles to reach the heights of that first season. The games now feel like an add-on to a baggier story that sprawls towards its ending.So there is a lot of time dedicated to the North Korean defector turned undercover guard Kang No-eul (Park Gyuyoung), and to Jun-ho’s (Wi Ha-joon) island-hopping search for his brother In-ho (Lee Byung-hun). As the Front Man, In-ho is as much the star of this final run as Gi-hun, and he offers rare and much-needed moments of subtlety. There is no excuse for the time given to the VIPs, who appear to be in a different show to everyone else.If you can get on board with the new contestant twist – and that is a big if – then the final two episodes have a nicely grand and operatic feel to them, and ultimately, Squid Game does its job. But it leaves the impression, too, that it has become a more traditional action-thriller than it once was. As to where it will go next, all bets are off.Squid Game is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsSquid GameTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

M3gan wassmarter than most, often sly and frequently funny and introducing what’s now become a rarity, an almost instant non-IP pop culture icon, whose virality exploded the film into a surprise smash (raking in over $180m from a $12m budget). Like the films it was inspired by, a franchise was inevitable although where we’re taken in M3gan 2.0 was far less of a given. For the follow-up, writer-director Gerard Johnstone has swerved from horror to action while retaining and tweaking the comedy with a release date that’s been upgraded to summer blockbuster territory. It doesn’t always work – a two-hour runtime that’s a little too long, world-saving stakes that are a little too big, funny lines that are a little too not funny – but it’s a mostly watchable second-tier event movie that, in a world of inconsequential sequels that fail to justify their existence, will do.F1 the Movie review – spectacular macho melodrama handles Brad Pitt with panacheRead moreFor M3gan 2.0, Johnstone has picked the Terminator 2 model, resurrecting M3gan to help destroy an even more evil robot called Amelia (Ukrainian actor Ivanna Sakhno) who has gone rogue. Since the previous film, understandably haunted roboticist Gemma (a returningAllison Williams, giving it her all once again) has rejigged her thinking on technology, fighting for the ethical use of AI and urging people to step away from their smartphones. But she’s forced to team up with the monster she created when Amelia threatens not just the lives of those around her but the entire world.The details of how we get there are absurdly convoluted and it takes a while for Johnstone to convince us that an evil doll movie really needs this much political conspiracy and corporate intrigue (with the addition of every new espionage element, I had to keep reminding myself I was watchinga M3gan movie). But it just about works with time, mostly down to its sheer energy, Johnstone pitching it as a goofy Mission: Impossible for younger teens (I did enjoy this mildly more than Tom Cruise’s boringly bloatedFinal Reckoning). The tonal swerve is reminiscent of that employed in another Blumhouse sequel,Happy Death Day 2Uthat transformed a fun, gimmicky slasher into an indecipherable sci-fi romp. That film couldn’t find a way out of the overly complicated mess it made for itself and the comparatively simple M3gan 2.0 finds a slicker way to reinvent itself.Words of War review – Maxine Peake leads line as murdered Putin-critic journalist Anna PolitkovskayaRead moreNo one could have predicted just how many memes the first film would spawn but it was still written, by Malignant’s Akela Cooper, with enough self-awareness to suggest that it wouldn’t be a complete surprise. The campaign for the sequel had been rather worrying, however, veering from self-aware to smug, ads built entirely on camp cheek, trailers soundtracked by Britney Spears’s Oops! … I Did It Again, grimly suggesting the film would be crippled by its thirst to go viral. It’s surprisingly restrained though in that regard and any studio-mandated repetition – yes, she dances again; yes, she sings another ballad at an inopportune moment again – feels mostly organic (a rendition of Kate Bush’s This Woman’s Work is arguably more effective than Sia and David Guetta’s Titanium was in the first). One of the major problems is that the comedy just doesn’t quite land this time around, bar one genuinely funny bit involving Steven Seagal film titles. Johnstone took over writing duties from Cooper but he hasn’t found a way to sustain M3gan’s humour despite ample insert-zinger-here moments.It’s also clear that Johnstone has retrofitted the film to act as an audition tape for bigger things, showcasing flashier adeptness on a much larger canvas, a sizzle reel to be sent on to execs looking for the next Marvel minion. His debut,Housebound, a thrilling comedy horror that pitched him as a mix of Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson, was a film of incredible ingenuity and it’s hard not to feel a little disappointed, if not exactly surprised, that his way up the studio system has demanded that edges be smoothed out and ambitions remain boringly generic. The finale of M3gan 2.0 is as familiar as any superhero ending, if a little more coherently choreographed, and while it’s sort of kind of just about effective enough (even if some muddled messaging about learning not to fear but coexist with AI is hard to stomach), I kept wishing we were in less well-charted territory. M3gan 2.0 isn’t an upgrade or a downgrade, but M3gan 3.0 could do with some new code.M3gan 2.0 is out in cinemas nowExplore more on these topicsM3ganAction and adventure filmsComedy filmsComedyArtificial intelligence (AI)reviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s hugely entertaining – if you can make it through the shaky startLucy ManganFri 27 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 00.01 EDTShareInever want to include spoilers, but sometimes they cannot be avoided. So, because I want you to stick with the new miniseries by Dennis Lehane, starring Taron Egerton (the pair reuniting after their great success with 2022’sBlack Bird), and enjoy the myriad benefits it will reap, I urge you to ignore any misgivings you have about the first two episodes of Smoke. Most of them will fall away. The tonal inconsistencies, the apparent self-indulgence of Lehane with his protagonist’s hobby, the dabs of bad characterisation – just keep the faith. If you can’t, then Google the true crime podcast on which Smoke is based and work out what must be happening from there. I’m not giving you the title because you’ll be ruining a lot of fun for yourself.It is not as though sticking with it will be too much of a hardship, even if you do have loads of questions. At its inception, Smoke is at the very least a solid police procedural. Egerton plays Dave Gudsen, a former firefighter who became an arson investigator after a traumatic callout put an end to his original career. When two serial arsonists start setting fires all over his patch and his searches for them stall, a detective from the local police department, Michelle Calderon (Jurnee Smollett), is brought in to help. She is in effect being punished for ending an affair with her captain (Rafe Spall) and is eager to catch the bad guys and restore her standing. Further complications to her private life include a mother in jail for an act first suggested by Calderon’s flashbacks to a terrifying experience in her childhood, then confirmed by her attendance at her mother’s parole hearing, in the face of deep hostility from her siblings.We meet one of the main suspects long before she and Gudsen do. Freddy Fasano (a mesmerising performance by Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine, which should see him clean up at awards time as thoroughly as Paul Walter Hauser did after Black Bird) is a cowed fry cook at a fast food outlet. Among other things, Lehane and Mwine make him a study in dreadful loneliness, whose ramifications spread like the fires set around the neighbourhood.One of the arsonists uses the “divide and conquer” method – setting alight crisp aisles (So fatty! So flammable!) in supermarkets before starting bigger fires elsewhere so the emergency services are stretched thin. It suggests someone with a working knowledge of the department’s resources, so Gudsen and Calderon begin the long task of matching firefighters’ absence records with the days previous fires occurred and homing in on the possible perpetrator. Smoke becomes a cat and mouse game, with the opposing sides circling each other in ways that become increasingly extreme, but never quite tip over into preposterous.It is hugely entertaining, though it is a shame that the main story slightly swamps Freddy’s and gives Mwine less to do as time goes on. But Egerton serves up an increasingly layered, clever performance as Gudsen, hitting every ball Lehane and the true story on which Smoke is based throw at him out of the park. It will certainly set him up for further and deserved success. Let’s hope it does the same for Mwine.Hang in there, and enjoy.Smoke is on Apple TV+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionTaron EgertonApple TV+reviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a film that aches with longing. It’s knotty with the mess of cultural identity. All three of its leads do tremendous, heartbreaking work, but Greta Lee deserved an Oscar for her outstanding central performance. That she didn’t even receive a nomination is utterly baffling. Nevertheless, consider this an update to Brief Encounter, only with a less infuriatingly paternalistic ending.Sunday 29 June, 10pm, BBC TwoGloryView image in fullscreenHe’s never bettered this performance … Denzel Washington in Glory.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyEd Zwick’s recent memoirHits, Flops, and Other Illusionshas much to recommend it (not least the astonishing bridge-burning chapter about his involvement with Shakespeare in Love), but chief among its qualities is how much it will make you want to rewatch Glory. Zwick’s film about an African American regiment in the civil war is a true epic. The script swings for the fences. Cinematically it spills from the screen. And, let’s not forget, this is the movie that announcedDenzel Washingtonas a major presence. He still may not have bettered this performance.Saturday 28 June, 12:30am, Channel 4The SwimmerView image in fullscreenThe greatest midlife crisis movie ever made … Janet Landgard and Burt Lancaster in The Swimmer.Photograph: Pictorial Press /AlamyStarting life as a short John Cheever story in the New Yorker,The Swimmerdoes its best to defy as many conventions as it can. Burt Lancaster plays Ned Merrill, an ad executive who one day decides to “swim home” by clambering in and out of every pool he passes. Along the way he attempts to seduce a string of women, refers to himself in ever more grandiose terms and begins to detach from the easy suburbia he finds himself in. Before long he has spiralled out of control. Dark and hallucinogenic, it’s perhaps the best midlife crisis movie ever made.Monday 30 June, 4:55pm, Film4The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & SnakesView image in fullscreenTurn back time … Tom Blyth as Coriolanus Snow and Rachel Zegler as Lucy Gray Baird.Photograph: BFA/Murray Close/ Lionsgate/AlamyThis needs to be said upfront:The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakesis a musical. Even though the film’s publicity really did not want you to know about it, this is a film where Rachel Zegler will not stop singing. But forewarned is forearmed, and once the shock of the genre has worn off, what’s left might be the best Hunger Games movie yet. A prequel, this is an origin story for Coriolanus Snow (the authoritarian ruler played in previous movies by Donald Sutherland), so it gets to exist in the moral murk more happily than the rest of the series.Tuesday 1 July, Netflixskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What’s preposterous is that they are respectively played by John Cena and Idris Elba. Even more preposterously, it’s an action buddy comedy by Ilya Naishuller, the director of Nobody. Did the world need a film where the leaders of the western world are stranded in the middle of nowhere and have to machine-gun their way out in a whirlwind of quips? Absolutely not.

Though listed on the schedule only as the mysterious “TBA”, playing the Woodsie stage for an hour shortly after the festival’s kick-off on Friday morning, the anonymous artist’s identity was seemingly widely known weeks before.Ella Yelich-O’Connor herself had not been exactly subtle, meaningfully flashing her eyes at Radio 1’s Greg James when he pointed out that the release of her fourth album, Virgin, coincided with Glastonbury’s first day. On Thursday, ahead of Virgin’s release, she provided confirmation by posting an aerial photo of the Woodsies tent on Instagram.Lorde: Virgin review | Alexis Petridis’s album of the weekRead moreIt’s a bold move, to debut a new album to a crowd who won’t yet have had a chance to listen to it, let alone form any impressions – but Lorde has that kind of clout. Since her precocious debut, Pure Heroine, she has enjoyed a devout fanbase, many of whom look on her as a big sister figure: worldly and warm, but only intermittently available. With 2017’s critically acclaimedMelodrama, too, she secured her status as a pop star who is only more attention-grabbing for having only sporadic releases.With Virgin – it’s been made clear, from the three singles and pre-album press – Yelich O’Connor is taking a different tack to music, attempting something looser, more immediate and more off-the-cuff. She debuted first single What Was That with a guerilla performance in New York City’s Washington Square Park, and has since played a series of small pop-up gigs to only the most connected fans. Second single Man of the Year and opening track Hammer both have a suggestive, half-finished yet considered quality, as though Lorde was gently attempting to warn fans: she is not the same star that they remember.Arriving on stage to strobe lighting and a huge cheer, Lorde is dressed simply in a white baby tee and cargo pants, resembling, with her shock of dark hair, Patti Smith – and also her younger self. ForSolar Power– her uncharacteristically sunny third album, which received faltering reviews – Lorde experimented with bleach-blond hair and variously sexy and/or smooth brain’d personae. Today, accompanied by a low-profile band, she appears minimalistic, uncomplicated, direct: recognisable as the teenager who burst out of nowhere with a sharp-eyed satire of celebrity excess, known for her big hair and idiosyncratic dance moves. And the crowd is glad to be reunited.But when it becomes clear Lorde is playing the new album in full, with a seamless transition from What Was That into a new song, Shape Shifter, the crowd’s energy visibly begins to flag. Yelich-O’Connor has always been a fully fledged performer; here, she kneels on the stage, hoiks up her T-shirt to caress her stomach, and plays to the camera with her face, smizing and snarling to impress upon us the personal nature of the lyrics. Like many songs on the album, Shape Shifter deals with Lorde’s desire not to be pinned on to any one evolution or identity, and reflects on those she’s lived so far: the siren, the saint. “I’ve been up on the pedestal, but tonight I just wanna fall.”View image in fullscreenThankful … Lorde on the Woodsies stage.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Hogan Media/ShutterstockBut though the audience extends her goodwill, bobbing gently to the music, it is just difficult to grasp the shape of these unfamiliar songs, lacking as they do immediate or obvious hooks and dealing with intimate and often challenging subject matter. She declines to give context, only addressing the crowd until after Favourite Daughter, a deceptively upbeat song about burnout, fuelled by familial (and fatherly) expectations. She thanks us for “being here with us on the day that Virgin is born”, and adds that this full album play-through may be a one-off. The crowd is clearly cheered by the sense of exclusivity, and to witness the return of their favourite pop star, but the songs aren’t immediately arresting enough to make the moment.Clearblue stands out among the new tracks, bringing to mind both Yellow Flicker Beat, Lorde’s excellent inclusion on The Hunger Games soundtack, and Imogen Heap’s iconic Hide and Seek in its pared-back layering of electronic vocals. But it’s a song for listening on headphones at home; the audience in the tent seems a little nonplussed. Later, the heartbreaking lyrics of Broken Glass – explicitly dealing with an eating disorder and the long reckoning of recovery – is lost on an audience who have not been given the chance to sit with them.“I didn’t know if I’d make another record, to be honest – but I’m back here, completely free,” Lorde says, to huge cheers. “I’m so grateful to you for waiting.” The packed-out tent is proof of how many people are willing to follow her wherever she will go, to bear with her while she figures out how she wants to present herself to the world. When, after David, the final track of Virgin, the opening chords of her much-loved song Ribs ring out, it feels like Lorde is rewarding fans for their patience – quite literally throwing them a bone.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025LordePop and rockGlastonbury festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve just worked with Paul Weller and Cast, but a lot of people I’d love to have worked with are no longer with us. Top of my list on a production level would beQuincy Jones.

It would be great to do something with Mavis.View image in fullscreenKeen collaborator … with(from left)Ian McLagan, Steve Marriott, Ronnie Lane and Kenney Jones of the Small Faces in 1968.Photograph: Gilles Petard/RedfernsOf all the artists you’ve collaborated with, who standshead and shouldersabove the rest?Aubrey26Tina Turner. Simply the best – and what a joy to have her start a career I never planned on. I was in a very abusive teenage marriage. I said a prayer to ask God to take me out of that situation and a couple of hours later I was in Tina’s living room, singing Dancing in the Street. I’d gone there to help some other ladies – Gloria Scott and Maxine Smith – get the gig, but another girl didn’t show up for the audition. Maxine remembered I used to sing in church and the rest is history. My whole career is all about the unexpected. It think it has a lot to do with manifesting dreams, although being called a “legend” doesn’t pay the bills.Are you going to Glastonbury with a band?GingerTomYes, I’m on the Acoustic stage with my fabulous band. I’ve had to edit my set down to 40 minutes, but it’s gonna be a great show. When I played in 2022, Diana Ross was on at the same time, but I still had a lot of people come and see me, or tell me they wish they had. This year,Rod Stewart is playingat the same time I’m on, but he’s complaining cos he’s only getting an hour and a half!As a young singer, you were one of the Ikettes. We all know about Tina Turner’s harrowing experience with Ike Turner. I hopeit wasn’t too bad for you.MovingGelatinePlatesThe most pleasant part was being on stage every night with that amazing band. We were on the road for two years and probably working 85 out of every 90 days. On the road in a bus, you see everything – a lot of bad behaviour – and I was very young and very shy, so I had to learn how to protect myself, by staying in my place. I wasn’t one of Ike’s women, so he couldn’t control me.View image in fullscreen‘Being called a “legend” doesn’t pay the bills’ … playing Cornbury festival in Oxford in 2018.Photograph: Harry Herd/RedfernsYour autobiography,SoulSurvivor, is intensely sad. How have you managed to let go of some of the bitterness about the way you were treated, particularly as a late teenager?saultbreakcherryI don’t hold grudges. The most horrible thing that’s happened to me in my life was losing my daughter. [Debra Arnold was killed in a car crash in 1977.] I had to let her go, but she’s with me every day. Unfortunately, in this industry, I also have to deal with a lot of politics, but I have to let it go and stay in the moment. I have to stay rooted in myself and that’s how I survive.Your performance with the Small Faces on Tin Soldier is unforgettable. What were they like to work with?revelstokeOh, just a joy. [Singer] Steve Marriott was like my soul brother. We were very young and enthusiastic: same age, same height. We hit it off immediately musically and dated for a short time. I’ve just recorded Afterglow, which the Small Faces wrote for me, but liked so much they took it back! If Steve were here now, he’d be the modfather. I miss him dearly and he visits me from time to time in dreams. I had a visitation from him not long ago.Unforgettable … PP Arnold and the Small Faces perform Tin Soldier.What were the sessions forPeter Gabriel’s Sledgehammerlike?steve_bayleyI’d had a tough time in America, so coming back to the UK and doing [the musical] Starlight Express and working with Peter was brilliant. I also sing on Don’t Give Up, which I’ve only just found out. We did a version before Peter did it with Kate Bush and I’m on her version singing: “Don’t give up …” towards the end. The sessions with Peter were great fun, especially once I discovered he was also into gravity boots. They’re a fitness thing I found out about when I lived in Miami. I used to hang upside down in my garden, doing sit-ups. Peter had them in the fitness room at his house, so we were both into hanging upside down, doing sit-ups.What are your memories of working withKeith Emerson? What’s the story about how you gave the Nice their name?WilliamWorking with Keith was an absolute pleasure. He was such a lovely guy and so very talented. I knew from the beginning that he had his own ambitions, but I was very happy that he was able to help me launch that period of my career. The band that became the Nice were my backing band [in 1967]. Steve Marriott had introduced me to a Lord Buckley album that had a song on it called The Nazz. With my accent, it sounded like The Nice, and “nice one” was a really hip expression in the 60s. So it was my idea to call my band the Nice. I saw Keith not long before he passed away and we talked about perhaps doing something else together. I went to the funeral. He loved what he did and when he wasn’t physically able to do it any more it would have been very hard for him.View image in fullscreen‘I was very young and very shy’ … PP Arnold in the 60s.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesI understand some of the money the KLF [as the K Foundation] burned on Jura was rightly yours. Can you tell us about that?pconlMe and Katie Kissoon were the Mu Mu Choir. I sang the hook on 3am Eternal. I was paid a session fee, but the deal was that if they used my solo performance I’d get 5%, which I never got because they claimed it wasn’t the song’s hook. I’ve got to let it go now, but it’s on their conscience. [The KLF did not respond to a request for comment.]Do you have anecdotes aboutAndrew Loog Oldham and Immediate Records?ZaropansIf it wasn’t for Andrew, there wouldn’t be a PP Arnold. He was the best manager and he had a vision for me; the only time in my career I’ve had creative management. Andrew was really into the west-coast girl group thing, so [Rolling Stones keyboardist] Ian Stewart suggested he check me out, and because Mick [Jagger] and I were tight he also drove the conversation. I became part of Immediate’s “industry of human happiness”. We were all very young and Andrew got caught up in the drug thing that went down with a lot of guys in those days and that was the downfall of Immediate. I wish I had someone like that in my life now, but I’m still in contact with Andrew.With youon Immediate and the equally amazingDoris Troy on Apple, the biggest stars of the day were lining up to play backing musician for you both. Any tales you’d care to share?Mr_202Madeline Bell, Doris and I all had the authentic gospel sound that everybody wanted on their records at the time. Doris and I did that Nick Drake song [Poor Boy, on Bryter Layter] together. Other than Keith Emerson … Steve Howe from Yes was in my band when I supported Eric Clapton on the Delaney & Bonnie tour. There’s a thing online somewhere about all the people in my bands who went on to be huge stars. I forget them all, but it was always easier for the boys. There are more women now, but the industry is difficult if you’re not a boyband or you’re not taking off your clothes to sing. I don’t get that. When we came to England, Tina started wearing short dresses and miniskirts, but she was always classy.No camping required!

How do you decide which songs you cover in live shows?bluelambrettaI have to identify with the lyric, the story. Shoot the Dove is about arguments and fights in relationships: “You kill the love when you shoot the dove.” I can relate to that. I’ve just done God Only Knows as a tribute toBrian Wilson, but I felt it wasn’t right to do it without also doing a tribute toSly [Stone], so at rehearsal yesterday I decided to do Que Sera, Sera as part of a medley for Glastonbury. “Whatever will be will be.” I can relate to that as well.A question from my daughter, Astrid: PP, I am six years old. I listen to your songs on my CD player. My favourite is Everything’sGonna Be Alright. My question is: why are you such a good singer?jonathan_liewAstrid, I think it’s because I just love to sing. I sang my first solo – a song called We Are Soldiers in the Army – when I was four years old. When I finished, everyone in the church started shouting because they were happy. So that’s why I sing: I like to touch that happy spot in everybody. I don’t know if you watch CBeebies, but I’m the voice of Cleo Nibbles, the soul mouse in the new Yukee series. A little mouse with a big voice.PP Arnold plays Glastonbury’s Acoustic stage on Sunday at 4pm. The previously unreleased The Immediate Sessions is out now on Charly Records.

So it is with NZO, a mysterious Sheffield-based electronic artist whose album Come Alive is a defibrillating jolt of vitality. You can find affinities with other artists and styles here, for sure: the bookish but playful minimalism of another Sheffield musician, Mark Fell; Objekt’s trickster vision for bass music and techno; the white-tiled cleanliness of some of Sophie’s work; Jlin’s paradoxically static funk. But the way it’s all pulled together is totally NZO’s, making for music that’s so light on its feet despite its incredible complexity.After a brief intro piece, main opener Rolling Around has all the hallmarks of dubstep but it’s as if a slight glitch is holding it back from a deep skanking rhythm. The little ripples of conga on AXMM, or the synthetic brass fanfares of Something’s Changed, are sounds you often hear in Chicago footwork music – probably deliberate homages, yet the actual productions are totally different, the former fidgeting, the latter bumping.NZO: Come Alive – streamSpotifyHer use of vocals is excellent, too, from the very quotable house-style command “won’t stop dancing til the DJ drops” on CFML, to faraway dream-pop singing on Something’s Changed. There’s more on half-stepping closer Looking For “: the kind of poignant snatch of pop that Burial reaches for, but rather than being cloaked in static, this lost transmission comes through with devastating clarity. This album is cute yet serious, danceable yet cerebral – very few people are operating at this level in British electronic music anywhere, much less with their debut.This week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenDev Hynes AKA Blood Orange.Photograph: Vinca PetersonBlood Orange – The FieldA fever dream of collaborators join Dev Hynes’ romantic return: the Durutti Column’s guitar blur meets Eva Tolkin’s racing production, Tariq Al-Sabir’s composition and vocals from Caroline Polachek and Daniel Caesar.LSThe Beths – No Joy“I don’t feel sad, I feel nothing,” Liz Stokes rues on a classic Beths track: kinetic powerpop that blasts her melancholy – about the new numbness of life on antidepressants – with sunshine.LSJonathan Richman – I Was Just a Piece of Frozen Sky Anyway“Will I make my change?” the Modern Lover asks his mother on what might be a gnomic nod to mortality, as Spanish guitar does a brisk dance with a lovely, fluted whistle.

I was perhaps three. We lived in a little mining town in the middle of the rainforest. It was always raining and the rain drummed on the tin roof. To this day that’s the sound I long to hear when I relax into a book – a voice in the stormy dark reminding me that I am not alone.My favourite book growing upBooks were an odyssey in which I lost and found myself, with new favourites being constantly supplanted by fresh astonishments. Rather than a favourite book I had a favourite place: the local public library. I enjoyed an inestimable amount of trash, beginning with comics and slowly venturing out into penny dreadful westerns and bad science fiction and on to the wonderfully lurid pulp of Harold Robbins, Henri Charrière, Alistair MacLean and Jackie Collins, erratically veering towards the beckoning mysteries of the adult world.The book that changed me as a teenagerAlbert Camus’s The Outsider. It didn’t offer a Damascene revelation, though. I was 11. I absorbed it like you might absorb an unexploded cluster bomb.The writer who changed my mindWhen I was 27, working as a doorman for the local council, counting exhibition attenders, I read in ever more fevered snatches Kafka’s Metamorphosis, which I had to keep hidden beneath the table where I sat, balanced on my knees. A close family forsaking their son because he has turned into a giant cockroach, after the death of which they marvel at their daughter’s vitality and looks? It dawned on me that writing could do anything and if it didn’t try it was worth nothing. Beneath that paperback was a notebook with the beginnings of my first novel. I crossed it out and began again.The book that made me want to be a writerNo book, but one writer suggested it might be possible for me – so far from anywhere – that I perhaps too could be a writer. And that wasWilliam Faulkner. He seemed, well, Tasmanian. I later discovered that in Latin America he seemed Latin American and in Africa, African. He is also French. Yet he never left nor forsook his benighted home of Oxford, Mississippi, but instead made it his subject. Some years ago I was made an honorary citizen of Faulkner’s home town. I felt I had come home.The book or author I came back toWhen I was young, Thomas Bernhard seemed an astringent, even unpleasant taste. But perhaps his throatless laughter, his instinctive revulsion when confronted with power and his incantatory rage speak to our times.The book I rereadMost years, Bohumil Hrabal’s Too Loud A Solitude, humane and deeply funny; and Anna Karenina, every decade or so, over the passage of which time I discover mad count Lev has again written an entirely different and even more astounding novel than the one I read last time.The book I could never read againOn being asked to talk in Italy on my favourite comic novel I reread Evelyn Waugh’s Scoop. It had corked badly. My fundamental disappointment was with myself, as if I had just lost an arm or a leg, and if I simply looked around it would turn back up. It didn’t.The book I discovered later in lifeGreat stylists rarely write great novels. Marguerite Duras, for me a recent revelation, was an exception. For her, style and story were indivisible. Her best books are fierce, sensual, direct – and yet finally mysterious. I have also just read all of Carys Davies’s marvellous novels, which deserve a much larger readership.The book I am currently readingKonstantin Paustovsky’s memoir The Story of a Life, in which the author meets a poor but happy man in the starving Moscow of 1918 who has a small garden. “There are all sorts of ways to live. You can fight for freedom, you can try to remake humanity or you can grow tomatoes.” God gets Genesis. History gets Lenin. Literature gets the tomato-growers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Girl newts cluster round to watch, while the boy newts flip on to their creepily human hands and shake their tails in the air. The waggiest newt is the winner, although the actual act of love is a strictly no-contact sport. The male deposits a packet of sperm on an underwater leaf for the female to collect and insert into her own reproductive tract. The whole business is best thought of, says Karen R Jones, as a “sexually charged game of pass-the-parcel”.This kind of anthropomorphising often strikes naturalists as unscientific or even downright distasteful. But Jones is an environmental historian and her methodology allows, indeed impels, her to start from the principle that Britain’s human and animal populations are culturally entwined. Consequently, we cannot “see” a fox, hedgehog or newt without bringing to it a rich stew of presumptions and fantasy, drawn from childhood picturebooks, out-of-date encyclopedias and, in my case, the 1970s TV classic Tales of the Riverbank, in which small critters say funny things in the West Country burr of .This pre-knowing can have a radical impact on the chances of a particular species flourishing or going under. Take hedgehogs, which, Jones tells us in this beautifully written book, have been in Britain for the last 15m years. They witnessed the extinction of the woolly mammoth and saw the first humans arrive in Europe. It was at this point that they started to pick up a reputation for general malevolence. Bandit-like, hedgehogs were reputed to sneak into human settlements at night and steal poultry eggs (true) and suck the udders of sleeping cows (almost certainly false). Their ability to munch on toxic toads without getting sick (true) and willingness to ferry any witch who had lost her broomstick (surely very uncomfortable) confirmed that hedgehogs had gone over to the dark side. No wonder that killing them counted as a public service: the records of one Cheshire village show 8,585 hedgehogs destroyed over a 35-year period in the late 1600s.View image in fullscreenMrs Tiggy-Winkle.Photograph: AlamyHow different from today, when the hedgehog routinely tops those “Britain’s favourite animal” polls. Now we build shelters for them in our gardens and worry about how they will fare when crossing the road. This radical shift of opinion, says Jones, can be traced back to one hugely popular book, Beatrix Potter’s The Tale of Mrs Tiggy-Winkle. Mrs Tiggy-Winkle is an industrious washerwoman who keeps her neighbours, including Peter Rabbit and his signature blue coat, spick and span. The influence of Potter’s 1905 classic has been so enduring that, when a charity was set up in 1983 to care for injured hedgehogs, it was obvious what its name should be. These days, Tiggywinkles is the largest wildlife hospital in the world.Beastly Britain is full of stories like this, which take an everyday animal – newt, hedgehog, pigeon, sheep, flea – and map out both its physical life (a matter of burrows, breeding cycles and flight paths) as well as its cultural traces, which concern legend, loathing and desire. Often these two kinds of knowing collide in startling ways. Take sheep, which are mostly seen as “white noise in the countryside”, bland and bleating and only good for counting yourself to sleep. In fact, Jones reveals, they are crackingly clever, able to recognise the faces of up to 50 of their sheep-friends, not to mention their human guardians.The revelations keep on coming. For instance, that we are still living among dinosaurs. The next time a pigeon swoops down to steal a chip, take a close look at its scaly, reptilian feet. They are the legacy of the Archaeopteryx, a winged dinosaur the size of a raven, with a bony tail, flight feathers and an ability to glide over short distances. Less persuasive, though even more intriguing, is the possibility that a pod of plesiosaurs still bobs off the Devon and Cornwall coast. How else to account for the string of sightings of a giant grey sea snake, with a long neck, snakey head and vicious tusks? The rational part of us knows that this sea monster is likely to be a basking shark or a giant piece of flotsam. Our dreaming part longs for it to be a remnant from ancient times, what Jones calls a “proximate peculiar”, that refuses to quite come into view.Beastly Britain by Karen R Jones is published by Yale (£20).

He led the firm for half a century, continuing his parents’ aim of bringing authoritative scholarship on the world of art and culture to a wide readership.Neurath, who has died aged 84 of cancer, developed the bedrock World of Art series, which had launched in 1958, to encompass some 300 titles covering the history of art; more than a million copies of the books have now been sold.“I can’t remember ever wanting to be a publisher,” Neurath said in a 2011 interview with Livres Hebdo, the weekly bible of the French book trade. “And then one day I was.” It would have been a difficult fate to avoid. As the photography historian Philippe Garner, said, Neurath “carried European history in his DNA”.His father’s stepfather, Arthur Stemmer, a noted collector of Egon Schiele, had fled Vienna for London after the Anschluss; Thomas’s parents, Walter, a publisher and gallery owner, and Marianne (nee Müller), a schoolteacher, had also escaped to England from Austria in 1938. Thames & Hudson became part of that injection of continental culture into postwar Britain that would include everyone from Ernst Gombrich to Oskar Kokoschka.Thomas joined the family business as an editor in 1961, his life changing completely when his father died six years later. He became responsible for the day to day running of Thames & Hudson – his sister, Constance, took over design – and he would remain the company’s managing director until 2005, and chairman until 2021.View image in fullscreenSome of the titles in the World of Art series. Neurath aimed to bring authoritative scholarship on the world of art and culture to a wide readership.Photograph: Thames & HudsonIt was a daunting inheritance. In Vienna, Walter had, among much else, taught at the equivalent of the Workers’ Educational Association, and Thames & Hudson was shaped by the Fabian ideal of providing high quality books at affordable prices, particularly to students. Thomas felt duty bound to continue “the heritage and socialist ideals of my parents”.At the same time, he had no intention of allowing the company to go bust by preserving it in aspic. “In my father’s view, only painting, architecture and sculpture counted as art in their own right,” Neurath said. “He thought of photography as lacking in seriousness and fashion as frivolous.” Both of these were now added to the T&H lists, while definitions of the fine arts were broadened and modernised.In 1984, the company became the first to publish a book on graffiti, in the form ofMartha Cooper and Henry Chalfant’s Subway Art. Others followed on such non-Eurocentric subjects as Buddhist and Aboriginal Australian art. Neurath, a child of the 60s, also introduced titles on what he called “archetypal psychology”, including John Michell’s deeply kooky 1969 book View Over Atlantis.All these appeared alongside the heavyweight works of scholarship his father had favoured, together with exhibition catalogues for galleries and museums around the world.If Neurath broadened the company’s cultural reach, he also set about globalising its business. Like many refugees from Nazism, the Neuraths had been eager to assimilate. One of the books on Thames & Hudson’s first list in 1950 was Geoffrey Grigson’s English Cathedrals. Before studying at Cambridge, Thomas had been sent to Charterhouse, a leading public school. But for all his parents’ efforts, he never seemed entirely English.Royalty puzzled him: when T&H produced a book on the photographs of Cecil Beaton, Neurath was heard to moan, “But who is the Duchess of Gloucester?” He was prone, without thinking, to assume that all his editors could read German.As well as building on the World of Art, with titles now translated into 16 languages, he opened T&H offshoots abroad. The company’s original two-river name had anticipated operations in London and New York, both of them English-speaking cities. In 1989, Neurath set up Éditions Thames & Hudson in Paris, the World of Art series becoming L’Univers de l’Art. “I loved being there,” he said. “It had always been a dream of mine to have an office in Paris.”For all his insistence on guarding his parents’ socialist principles, Neurath was a skilful businessman. The suggestion that Thames & Hudson might be in some way a philanthropic concern made him bristle. His genius for forming allegiances with foreign publishing houses helped the company flourish at a time when other publishers were going to the wall.Neurath was born in Brackley, Northamptonshire, after his parents found wartime refuge in Britain. His father worked for a publishing company called Adprint and, following Marianne’s death in 1950 aged 40, marriedEva Feuchtwang (nee Itzig), a colleague and fellow refugee with whom he set up Thames & Hudson.After leaving school, and a short spell with a publisher in Israel, which he hated, Thomas was sent to Paris, to work as an intern at the French house Éditions Arthaud. Moving into theso-called Beat Hotelin rue Gît-le-Cœur – a fleapit whose residents included Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs – the 18-year-old found himself caught up in the glory days of the Left Bank. Photographs of the time show him beaming widely and, invariably, smoking. From there, he left to read archaeology and anthropology at St John’s College, Cambridge – he hated this, too, and dropped out – joining Thames & Hudson in 1961.The firm remained, above all, a family affair. Neurath’s two daughters followed him into the business, becoming T&H directors. More broadly, employees were treated as though they were family, occasionally alarmingly so. Neurath’s fits of temper were famous: Thames & Hudson mythology includes the story of him throwing a shoe at a startled archaeology editor. But loyalty was bred on both sides. The company’s employees tended to stay, sometimes for their entire careers.Beneath his chain-smoking bearishness, Neurath was a shy man. Unlike his stepmother, Eva, who was driven to the office every day in a chauffeured Bentley, he shunned public life, preferring the company of his children and grandchildren in his book-filled north London house. This, too, retained a faint air of prewar Vienna. “I grew up in a house where we talked a lot about culture and literature,” Neurath said.He is survived by his wife, Gun Thor, a jewellery designer, whom he married in 1962, their daughters Johanna and Susanna, and his sister, Constance.Thomas Neurath, publisher, born 7 October 1940; died 13 June 2025Explore more on these topicsPublishingArt and design booksobituariesShareReuse this content"

But looking after the needy clones of myself I’d made to help run a space base, I was reminded all too clearly of my limitations and failingsFri 27 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 19.24 EDTShareOther than during that golden period when they were old enough to play games and watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer but hadn’t yet become evil teenagers, I don’t think I’m very good at parenting. When my kids were babies I felt unnecessary and useless, a feeling I have been reminded of most days since. That’s OK. We can’t be good at everything. I can read words backwards and upside down but I can never find my house keys. I am brilliant at dancing to the Cure’s The Lovecats on Dancing Stage MegaMix but terrible at DIY.Don’t get me wrong: I love my children. I like hanging out with them socially as young adults because they are smart, funny and entertaining, but then they remember I am their dad, and everything is ruined as they ask me to do stuff then blame me for everything wrong in their lives.So I took advantage of the fact that they all went away on the same weekend to have some uninterrupted dad time and sink my teeth into a game with depth, without disturbance. That game was The Alters.I loved the concept. You are stuck on a planet and have to clone different versions of yourself to operate the base and survive. That’s really clever. Even better: you create the clones by looking at your life path and picking moments when you made certain decisions that led to you becoming the Jan Dolski that you are.For example, if you select the path where you went off to study rather than entering the mines like your dad did, then you clone Jan the Scientist, an ace researcher. If you went to work on oil rigs, you create Jan Worker, a load-lightener. If you decide that all you want to do is sit on your backside all day playing with words, you become Jan Writer. (Except you don’t. There is no Jan Writer option, which shows how useless I would be in a survival situation.)View image in fullscreenChoosing from the branching paths of your life … The Alters.Photograph: 11 bitIt’s a compelling game mechanic because you are not only exploring, resource building and problem solving, you are questioning the whole nature of decision making. It makes you go back through your own life, wondering at the choices you made and what could have been different.This is horribly depressing though and I wouldn’t recommend it. Stick to the game’s story, not your own.The problem is that the more clones you have in The Alters, the more you have to work to keep them fed, healthy and entertained. And they are needy little bastards whose first language is Whine. It didn’t matter about the fresh food I gave them, the movies I sat through or the games of beer pong I deliberately lost – the Jan Miner character was determined to be grumpy and confrontational, and Jan Scientist was constantly punchably irritating.Whenever I thought I was triumphing at managing the base – helped by a system that allows you to set up automatic production of important things like radiation filters to keep you safe, and allotting different clones to regularly do specific shifts – I would have to drop what I was doing and run around doing something else for my dependants to keep them happy.You see where I am going with this?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a parenting sim. The very last thing I want to do with my free time. My failures in the game (and there are many) are accompanied by me screaming at the needy sods to give me a break for five minutes. My neighbours probably still think my kids are still at home.I have never felt so strongly that I am the wrong person to play a game that is so right. The script and story are strong, almost like an interactive version of Andy Weir’s The Martian. Philosophical concepts are bandied around, such as Camus’s idea that heroism is easy, and it’s doing the normal things that is the real challenge in life. And the graphics are so distinctive and mesmerising they are works of art. The space base moves around like a futuristic take onHowl’s Moving Castle. The game questions the very meaning of existence and what we’re supposed to do with it, and it is moving to witness the clones react to their new reality. Some hate you, others are fascinated, but all at points bond with you over shared memories of everything from Mom’s pierogies and beloved lava lamps to how you dealt with your abusive father.There is imagination and intelligence in abundance. It would make an incredible novel or animated movie. And 1990s Dominik, who had no kids or responsibilities, would have found marshalling a load of interesting, talented but whiny dependants a fun novelty. It’s like The Game of Life, which was a fun board game to play as kids, but hell when we had two in the back seat of our car. Maybe The Alters is the perfect game for you to play if you arethinkingabout having kids. In fact I urge anyone of child-bearing or rearing age to play it immediately, to see if you are up to the task in real life or if, like me, it all turns out to be too much hard work.Explore more on these topicsGamesParents and parentingFamilySimulation gamesRole playing gamescommentShareReuse this content"

But the elements provided a sublimely atmospheric accompaniment to the drama.View image in fullscreenSublimely atmospheric … Teatr Biuro Podróży’s The Tempest.Photograph: Aleksandra BębenekThunder within the soundtrack became indistinguishable from the real thing. As lightning cracked across the shipwrecked boat carrying Antonio, who fetches up on this enchanted isle, it seemed like part of the lighting design. The company,which has long staged outdoor works across the world, spun its own magic, the actors sodden but heroically undeterred.Directed and co-written (with Marta Strzałko) by company founder Paweł Szkotak, this production is inspired by Shakespeare’s text rather than being a straight-up enactment. After the opening storm, the set is cracked apart and swivelled around to form promontories on the island, as well as the grounded remains of the boat. Stumps of trees scattered in the foreground are visual symbols of eco damage.Łukasz Matuszyk’s magnificent score reflects an island full ofaural enchantments – “sound and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not” – switching the tone between storybook delight and electronic rumbles, dread groans and pumping house beats.View image in fullscreenTradition and reinvention … Teatr Biuro Podróży’s Tempest.Photograph: Aleksandra BębenekThe Tempest is part of the outdoor offering at Malta festival, a multidisciplinary programme in its 35th year, and the show is travelling to the UK as part of an international tour. The festival this year is celebrating tradition and reinvention. This company give a microcosmic homage to this paradoxical mission in its early faithfulness and late disruption of Shakespeare’s text. It is mostly told through mime, music, physical theatre and inventive visual spectacle.Prospera is a female magician, Caliban her indentured slave in a suit with sinister bandages around his face. He is forced by Prospera to extract natural resources from the isle, hacking away at tree stumps with his tools (the eco message of the show has been carried through in production values, with much of the set crafted from reclaimed materials, including salvaged doors from Poznań tenement houses). Ariel is an imposing fairy on stilts. All hover between the delightful and dreadful.The seven-strong cast (Bartosz Borowski, Łukasz Kowalski, Paweł Stachowczyk, Marta Strzałko, Karolina Wensierska, Tomasz Wrzalik, Maciej Zakrzewski) bring stunning physicality to their parts. The drunken scenes involving Trinculo, Stephano and Caliban play out with surprising freshness and wit, involving beer and a wheelbarrow. The romance between Miranda and Ferdinand is water-bound in its motifs – the latteremerges out of the storm in bikini bottoms like a parody of a James Bond love interest – and there is lovely use of a pair of flippers. Endearing chemistry is created through the dances they do around and with each other.The show stays faithful until the closing scenes, when there is a coup orchestrated that is far bigger than Caliban’s planned rebellion. The sound of a helicopter is heard as a giant plume of smoke envelops the audience, from which emerge military figures bearing machine guns. It is as if we, the audience, enter into the dream world as the smoke drifts over us and the tone switches once again. There is no tidy redemption for the sorcerer-coloniser. Her magical creatures flee or are caught and caged, like zoo animals.Some loose ends are left dangling: Ariel seems simply to disappear; the young couple at the heart of the play, cocooned in their romantic bubble, seem impervious to the assault on Prospera’s isle. Maybe the message here is that only love will survive. The rain has cleared by the end of the night and despite the razed ground of this new ending, you are left with a delightful sense of invention, play – and, yes, magic.Malta festivalruns until 28 June. The Tempest is presented byWatermans, at Bell Square, London, 19-20 September as part of theUK/Poland Season 2025.

Every side is pasted with neurotic headlines misinforming passersby about vaccines. It is an odd, not to mention dangerous,throwback to the pandemic.So, too, in its own benign way, is Douglas Maxwell’s play. It is not just that Man’s Best Friend concerns a lockdown-era bereavement, a hospital stay in isolation and a funeral on Zoom. It is also that its themes are steeped in those strange months when it felt we had been plucked out of time. Maxwell evokes the days when past and future were denied us.There is clapping for the NHS, a new moment of neighbourliness and an urge to yell out the names of those we have lost. More than that, there is a sense of rootlessness and irresolution. A world in limbo.It is apparent from the start that something is awry with Ronnie. Performed with storytelling panache by Jordan Young, he is a man who cannot settle. Despite a cheery disposition, an invigorating job as a dog walker and a satirical eye for the rituals of outdoor life, he is out of sorts. He is not yet an emergency case (he has based his Zen meditation techniques on an advert for Center Parcs), but nor is he at ease.Thus, he walks with Albert, Fury, Carlos, Coriander and Rex around the embracing curves of Becky Minto’s plank-lined set, as Grant Anderson’s lighting shifts from pale dawn to fiery dusk, Ross Collins’s cute canine illustrations come and go, and Maxwell’s monologue grows from lighthearted to maudlin. Beyond the easy comedy, it is a play stalked by death and a yearning for release.First seen in 2022 in the lunchtime seriesA Play, a Pie and a Pintand now restaged by Jemima Levick in a handsome 80-minute production, it is vivid and touching. But it is also not quite of this time. For all Maxwell’s perceptivity about loneliness, loss and dogs, and for all Young’s vulnerability and charm, the world of Man’s Best Friend is neither close enough nor far away enough to hit where it hurts.AtTron theatre, Glasgow, until 12 July; then touring, 3–27 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreTron theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

In 1905 New York, Esther, a skilled Black corset-maker, creates ravishing undergarments in Wedgwood blue or salmon pink, trimmed with “every manner of accoutrement”. Stitching romance for others, she fears she will never know her own – until George begins writing from Panama, where he is labouring on the canal.Tucked into her modest, mouse-grey dress, Samira Wiley’s Esther embroiders dreams with every letter. Despite forebodings from her landlady (Nicola Hughes, plush and beady), she insists: “I am his sweetheart twice a month and I can fill that envelope with anything I want.” Kadiff Kirwan’s melodious, greedy-eyed George arrives in New York and the first act ends on the edge of hope. Later, disappointment settles: intimacies fray, promises prove moth-eaten.View image in fullscreenTumbling out confidences … Faith Omole in Intimate Apparel.Photograph: Helen MurrayFoot on the treadle, eye on the lace, Esther knows her worth. Nottage writes so well about work: the painstaking immersion of time, thought and effort. The audience, fully invested in Esther’s world, gasped when George tossed aside her tailoring: how callous to spurn a love-stitched jacket. Wiley’s fragile frame can barely hold the hurt.Esther’s clients are unmarried, or yoked without love. Intimacy seems possible in your scanties: Faith Omole’s sex worker and Claudia Jolly’s wealthy wife tumble out confidences as she tweaks their corsets. Esther also visits a Jewish fabric salesman (Alex Waldmann, beautifully tentative), tenderly scanning swathes of kingfisher silk or wool spun from cosseted Scottish sheep. Restrictive garments play against unbounded imaginings.Lynn Nottage: Intimate Apparel and what lies beneath my playsRead moreNottage’s writing in the two-handed scenes is palpably lush (“a gentle touch is gold in any country”), but each line sharpens a character or sighs the tale forward. Working with movement directorShelley Maxwell, Lynette Linton’s production becomes a dance, a poem: bodies swoop around one another, voices tangle in song, teasing out the sensuality these New Yorkers crave but must deny themselves.The acting is incredibly fine: Linton’s great gift is to see people from every angle. Nottage’s play began when she found a photo of her seamstress great-grandmother and wanted to imagine her story. This tremendous production and Wiley’s superb performance fill out a life unknown.AtDonmar Warehouse, London, until 9 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreDonmar WarehouseLynn NottageLynette LintonreviewsShareReuse this content"

His family subsequently attempted to destroy all evidence of the man who had shamed their proud line of landowners and empire builders.Seiriol Davies first discovered hints of the forgotten, cross-dressing Edwardian aristocrat on childhood trips to a local National Trust property, and debuted this chamber musical about him on the Edinburgh fringenine years ago. This new production, directed by Lisa Spirling, adds zhuzh to the songs, with an onstage four-piece band – directed by Dylan Townley’s Maestro – augmenting its original cast.As Paget, Davies sparkles in a series of fabulous outfits beneath designer Hayley Grindle’s studded-collar proscenium arch (there are also shades of Faringdon House, the home of Paget’s fellow aesthete Lord Berners, who makes an appearance in the story). Both script and songs are crammed with wit as we pinball between classical harmonies, dance breaks and interactive gags with prompt cards.View image in fullscreenFresh zhuzh … How to Win Against History.Photograph: Pamela RaithA colonial-nod of a patter song, extolling “boots and feathers”, races us through Paget’s typically brutal boarding school upbringing and propels us towards his marriage of convenience with his cousin Lilian. She is played – along with all the other people in Paget’s life – by the indefatigable Matthew Blake, exhibiting great comic range as the ultimate “supporting actor” here.We see him most as Mr Alexander Keith, a Victorian impresario in an enormous peach smoking jacket and the closest thing Paget has to a friend as they tour their terrible shows together. Supposedly Paget’s bad art is his way of trying to find human connection. The problem is that, beyond the wide-eyed delusions and the metaphors about diamonds living in his head, we never get enough of a sense of him to know what that means.His loneliness may be touchingly real but the sentimental moments arrive like a demand for sympathy rather than something earned. Providing restitution from historical erasure is undoubtedly a worthy goal of art – but this show feels more like a message than an encounter.AtBristol Old Vicuntil 12 July.

Spotting a Palestinian Liberation Organisation rally, he stops to take pictures and promptly takes his prints to a photo agency on Fleet Street. Incredibly, one of them ends up on the front cover of the Daily Mirror, pocketing the child snapper the princely sum of £16.There are many remarkable stories like this surroundingDennis Morrisand his photographs at his three-floor exhibition Music + Life. Born in Jamaica, Morris moved to London before encountering photography through a camera club at his local church, St Mark’s in Dalston. There was, perhaps as a consequence, a religiosity about the way Morris devoted himself to the medium (he was dubbed “Mad Dennis” for preferring photography over football). Around the same time as he shot the PLO protest, Morris had also set up a humble commercial photo studio in the bedsit he shared with his mum – he pinned up a white sheet and borrowed a tungsten spotlight from St Mark’s. A few of these pictures from the early 1970s feature in the show, striking in their maturity and command of the camera. He understood how to make his subjects look and feel good.View image in fullscreen‘Dignity and pride’ … Admiral Ken with Bix Men, Hackney, London, 1973.Photograph: Dennis MorrisThe show highlights not only Morris’s instinct for a decent picture but his enterprise from such a young age, and his knack for being in the right place at the right time – the secret ingredient of any master documentary photographer. That spirit of determination and robust sense of self-belief seems to guide Morris in his photographs, to look where no one else is looking. A feeling of self-worth was what attracted him to photographing, and his subjects – whether impoverished residents of 1970s Hackney or globally revered musicians – have it in spades.There are the sharply-dressed “box men”, transporting sound systems across town, and couples at blues dances, where whisky shots and plates of curried goat cost £1. Even when the walls are peeling and decrepit, “dignity and pride” is in abundance, as the title of one portrait of an elegant male figure in Hackney declares.By the age of 14, another cleverly choreographed encounter led Morris to make the body of work that has eclipsed everything else he’s done – his portraits of Bob Marley. Morris went to the Speak Easy Club on Margaret Street one day in May 1973 and hung around waiting for Marley to show up for soundcheck. It coincided with a monumental moment for the reggae star, who was in town with the Wailers to play their first London gigs as part of the Catch a Fire tour. The four-day run at the club was sold out. Morris of course managed to meet Marley – and from that exchange, Marley invited Morris to join the group for the rest of the tour.Music + Life includes Morris’s iconic 1973 triptych portrait of Marley smoking (among the many things Marley taught Morris, the photographer has said, was how to smoke a joint). Other strikingly intimate images by the teenager that make you think that Marley, in his Adidas SL72 trainers, was an avuncular figure for this kid suddenly propelled out of Hackney and into the world.Marley opened up a world to Morris, who went on to photograph every major reggae star of the era, then later the punk scene too. These photographs, including brilliant ones of the Sex Pistols, take up a whole floor of Music + Life. They arethe work Morris is best known for, published as magazine and album covers, merchandise and posters, taken in Kingston and London.View image in fullscreenSid Vicious and Johnny Rotten, Coventry bus station, 1977.Photograph: Dennis MorrisHis portraits draw out the personas of reggae’s bigshots. There’s a controversial publicity photo of Steel Pulse, who are dressed as Ku Klux Klan members for the sleeve of their 1978 single of the same name. There’s the flash lighting up Big Youth’s dreadlocks, the lens pushed close to his face, and a shot of a majestic Dennis Brown toking. The photographs crackle with the heat of dancing, the fever of nights at recording studios. You can almost smell the marijuana.The familiarity of these iconic images is part of the appeal of seeing them now in the gallery. But it’s those early photographs that serve as a reminder of the harder realities of his roots. Many of these works were published in Morris’s 2012 monograph Growing Up Black but are less widely known and appreciated. They show how his resourcefulness and inventiveness developed from a lack of opportunity and a need to survive.A boy begging on Dalston’s smoky, broken and desolate Sandringham Road in 1976, which is barely recognisable today, possibly presents a stirring moment of identification. The boy is not much younger than Morris when he took the picture. The same feeling emanates from a portrait of a young Sikh girl carefully holding a newborn baby relative in a shop in Southall in 1974 – one of Morris’s rare documents of the area’s Sikh community. It’s there in the choirboys, youths at demonstrations, squatter kids or those residing atBlack House on Holloway Road.These images say an awful lot, helping us understand how the capital has changed in a generation. This is Morris the entrepreneurial young spirit, away from the stardom and success. And for all the visible hardship and trenchant tension in these images, it’s clear Morris loved being in these places with these people, and they loved him back.At the Photographer’s Gallery, London, until 28 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsDennis MorrisreviewsShareReuse this content"

For 60 years, nothing has stopped this nightlife institution partying till dawn – not even a power cut. When a storm knocked out the electricity one night in the mid-1970s, the French news presenter Yves Mourousi simply drove his car into the venue, and the dancing continued to the sound of its stereo.La Chu, as it’s known, opened in June 1965, making it one of the longest surviving discotheques in the world – behind Los Angeles’s Whisky-a-Go-Go, Paris’s Chez Castel and Rome’s Piper Club. It’ll be celebrating this feat of nightclub stamina on 29 June with a huge shindig at this most unlikely of venues smack-bang in the middle of the Camargue marshes. With 4,000 guests expected, the event will unite the three or four generations who’ve passed through its hallowed doors.We've got bulls 100m away!Once one of France’s coolest nightspots, La Chu’s rustic setting gave it a uniquely eclectic clientele: callused cowboys from the Camargue’s bull-ranches, village kids hopped up on the rock’n’roll infiltrating Europe, local gay men and women finally able to express themselves and Parisians on the hunt for something more authentic and wild (mosquitoes included) than the typical big-city spots. Frisky club-goers who have wandered outside for a roll in the hay have been known to have their ardour dampened after straying into a field of bulls.View image in fullscreenRed hot … La Churascaia gets going.Photograph: La ChurascaiaAs the legend of La Chu grew in the late 1960s and 70s, so did the celebrity clientele, including designerChristian Lacroix, singers Johnny Hallyday and Régine, Gérard Depardieu, first lady Claude Pompidou and the UK’s future Lord Great ChamberlainDavid Rocksavage. Legend has it that Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis – who certainly stayed at founderJean Lafont’s house – passed through one night in the early 70s.“The symbol I immediately think of is the moped and the Rolls-Royce side-by-side,” says Lacroix, a frequent Churascaia visitor in the late 60s and 70s. “Because that’s what you saw in the parking area and inside the club, too. There was no VIP area and no bodyguards.”La Chu owed this provincial-metropolitan blend to the club’s founder, themanadier(bull-rancher)Lafont, who died in 2017. By day he could be found in the pastures of the Camargue rearing a prized bovine bloodline, but by night he was an aesthete and bon vivant who would frequently hop on a flight to Paris to soak up the capital’s nightlife.View image in fullscreenCountry kicks … La Churascaia today.Photograph: La ChurascaiaLafont decided he wanted his own club close to home. “Once he’d decided to do something, there was nothing you could do to stop him,” says Mario Costabel, the son of a clam fisherman whom, aged 23, was made the Churascaia’s manager and Lafont’s right-hand man. The pair built a rudimentary circular building with plaster walls and a thatched roof, which resembled both the bull-running arenas and the Camargue cottages in which the local cowboys lived. The name is the generic term for a Brazilian grill restaurant.Initially built to host celebrations after bull-branding events over the summer, La Chu was only meant to be temporary. It shared the cheap’n’cheerful mores of the local village fetes, selling pastis in a metre-long line of glasses. But by the end of 1965, word had spread about its freewheeling bacchanals, often running until 10 or 11 the next morning, and it became swamped. “There was a queue of cars running from the club all the way down to the main road, a few kilometres down,” says Costabel. “We realised we’d been overtaken by events – we had to warn the police.”Film-maker Rémi Sautet, a regular in the 1960s, says: “It was really a social laboratory of the night, one that anticipated today’s world. It was a place with a strong latent sexuality, and an undercurrent of violence, where you danced until the break of day to the musical gods of the epoch.” One cutting-edge aspect was the music: hot-off-the-press rock’n’roll sourced from Parisian record shops, London’s Tower Records and an air hostess contact who helped them obtain rare imports from the US. The Jerks, one of France’s first rock’n’roll groups, from the nearby walled medieval town of Aigues-Mortes, was the house band.Christian Pelatan, the club’s principal DJ from the 60s to the 1980s, was militant about uptempo music and disdained slow numbers: “I didn’t see the need. Why break the party mood when people have come to blow off some steam and enjoy themselves?” His marathon sets had a sense of impromptu fun that marked out La Chu from too-cool-for-school Parisian nightspots. One record he liked to surprise the clientele with was marching-band staple The Washington Post; everyone in the club would suddenly break out in synchronised drill manoeuvres.Lafont’s arrival at the venue was traditionally announced with a burst of Verdi from the speakers; Lacroix, then a young student, remembers the owner often sporting a fringed western jacket. The entire club was a reflection of Lafont’s penchant for theatricality, suggests the designer: “There was this aspect of a fashion show, because you didn’t go to the Chu dressed any-old-how.” Lacroix used to attend decked out head-to-toe in red velvet. It was there he saw a man wearing a dress as a fashion statement for the first time: a djellaba by revolutionary French designer Jacques Esterel.View image in fullscreenMultigenerational … La Churascaia.Photograph: Stephane Barbier/Lafont familyBoth Lafont and Costabel being gay partially explained this unlikely bastion of gender fluidity in the heart of cowboy country. In the early 70s, a nationwide crackdown on licensing conditions meant that, in order to continue opening late, La Chu had to be licensed as an arts venue. So Lafont began staging drag shows on Sunday nights, mostly parodies of operas and musicals – which he wrote himself and performed in, along with other Chu stalwarts who might in regular life be wine-makers or miners. The Churascaia’s tolerant atmosphere was where this often macho and taciturn region declared its true identity.Unsurprisingly, given the firepit in the centre and the thatch, the first incarnation of the club eventually burned down at the end of 1981. It was rebuilt two years later by the modernist Catalan architect Ricardo Bofill and the club was sold by Lafont in 1995, when he was 73. Over the years, it’s become a focal point for Camargue identity due to its association with the surrounding bull-racing culture, and a local clientele that remains multigenerational in defiance of the youth-focused norm in the clubbing world. “The grandparents came, the parents came, and now their children are here. That’s the strength of the Chu,” says current manager and DJ Jérémy Campilongo.But La Chu’s sense of fiesta abandon and flair for the unexpected continues to attract revellers from further afield, with its music policy, as Campilongo points out, liable to suddenly break out of techno into jubilant bursts of Abba. As it hits 60, this indefatigable beacon of hedonism remains what all nightclubs aspire to being: a club like no other. “Most of them are just black boxes,” says Campilongo. “But here you’ve got bulls in the fields 100 metres away, horses beyond that. You arrive at night and the sun rises on the fields in the morning. What other club has that?”Explore more on these topicsClub cultureFranceGenderLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In truth, Cezanne had nothing to do with their choice of destination. But his mountain was the one thing my father knew of the region. He was three years into a four-year fine art degree (he painted portraits of the two of us daughters for his finals), steeped in painting and its history.When we landed at Marignane airport in nearby Marseille on 29 August 1989, a wildfire was ravaging the Sainte-Victoire, that celebrated mountain subject of so many of Cezanne’s works. In the tumult of the days that followed – our family unhoused, the mountain unrecognisable – my father hustled between estate agents with the sound of sirens ringing in his ears. “Cezanne must be turning in his grave,” he remembers one saying.In the 119 years since he died, Cezanne (no acute accent; it’s how he spelled it himself) has been crowned the father of modern art. It’s the lineage a host of disparate painters claimed in his wake. For Matisse he was “the father of us all” and for Picasso, “the mother who protects her children”. Futurists, cubists and fauvists felt the same. The symbolists said his was “pure painting”. And Gauguin, well: he bought six Cezannes when he was flush and only parted with them under duress when he wasn’t, having said, of the fabled Still Life with Fruit Dish from 1879-80, that he’d sooner sell everything he owned than lose it.View image in fullscreenCezanne’s L’Estaque Derrière Les Arbres (1878-79).Photograph: Mathieu Rabeau/RMN-GPAix, by contrast, has mostly been famous for hardly owning any Cezannes at all: first because it didn’t care to and then, when it was too late, because it couldn’t afford to. This summer the town celebratesCezanne 2025, a season dedicated to rewriting that story. The town set aside a budget of €26m for the full programme. This has included restoring and opening to the public the Bastide du Jas de Bouffan (the family’s country home of 40 years); the Lauves studio to the north; and the Bibémus quarries in the foothills of the Sainte-Victoire where Cezanne often worked. Also included is a major exhibition at the Musée Granet, which opens on 28 June, and reassembles for the first time works now housed in museums all over the world that Cezanne made in Aix; along with three other exhibitions in the town and a programme of live events. It is a family reunion.I have come back home to retrace Cezanne’s footsteps, literally, in a kind of reductionary process I liken to the expert restorers’ painstaking scraping off of decades of paint and paper on the walls of the old bastide. Growing up in Aix, “Cezanne” was a local lycée, “Bibémus” the rocks on which I learned to boulder, and the “Jas”, the neighbourhood in which I learned to drive. Returning to Aix, I want to walk where he walked to scrape these words back to their earlier meanings – to let these familiar landscapes be his once again.View image in fullscreenThe Bibémus quarry.Photograph: M. FraissetCezanne was born in 1839 in the old town centre. He lived in various homes in these narrow streets and, at 13, befriended the author Émile Zola on the school benches of the Collège Bourbon, now the Collège Mignet. His hatmaker father, Louis-Auguste, made so much money selling rabbit-skin wares (the big Aixois industry of his day) that he invested in a bank, in the process becoming even richer.When Cezanne was 20, his father purchased the bastide as a country retreat. From then on, and until his mother’s death in 1899, it would be what the president of the Société Paul Cezanne and co-curator of the exhibition, Denis Coutagne, calls “the centre of gravity” of Cezanne’s world. It is where he painted his first big works as a twentysomething, directly on to the decorative walls of the ground-floor Grand Salon.Recent restorations have revealed further Cezannes no one knew about – a scene of a port entrance he then partly painted over with a scene of a game of hide and seek. When the latter was removed to canvas by the home’s new owner, along with the Four Seasons and other famous panels, and sold on to museums, these fragments were simply papered over and forgotten about. In 1880, Louis-Auguste, who definitely viewed the property as something to boast about, nonetheless built Cezanne a studio: an enviably large room on the top floor, with a remarkably modern double-height window that bluntly interrupts the symmetry of the mansion’s facade. As Laforest puts it, that in itself puts paid to the myth that the father did not support the son’s endeavours.View image in fullscreenThe Bibémus quarry.Photograph: Courtesy of Dale Berning SawaI stand at the window. But for the military row of cypress trees forming an extra barrier inside the property wall to the right, I know the mountain is right there. On clear days, from the Jas, it appears as a perfect Matisse-like cutout in pale blue against a paler sky. Musée Granet director Bruno Ely, the other co-curator of the exhibition, tells me that the 1989 fire brought the Sainte-Victoire back to something closer to what Cezanne knew: the pine forest that was burning when I arrived is a 20th-century phenomenon. In the 19th century, all these hills were kept closely cropped by flocks of sheep.From the bastide to the Bibémus quarries takes about an hour and a half on foot. Cezanne would hitch a ride with a driver and a cart to get a bit closer, but once in what are now Aix’s north-eastern heights, he’d still have to walk an hour to reach the quarry. As I’m walking – from the bastide to the quarry to the dam Zola’s father built and down into Le Tholonet, where Cezanne lived later on; then back into town along the petite Route du Tholonet, which culture minister André Malraux had listed and renamed as the Route Cezanne in 1959 – I watch the mountain, this constant presence.View image in fullscreenLauves studio.Photograph: Sophie SpitériYou might say that the Mont Sainte-Victoire, as he called it, was to Cezanne what Rouen Cathedral was to Monet. However, his approach was completely at odds with the impressionists’. Monet recorded the changing light: it’s right there in the titles (“grey skies”, “sunshine”, “at sunset”). By contrast, Cezanne’s concerns, as Coutagne puts it, are “never documentary”, “never meteorological”, never about “the instant”. In 1876, Cezanne writes to a friend about olive trees having a greyish colour that is “permanent”. Matisse, Cezanne’s junior by 30 years, understood this. He wrote to a friend in 1918 that “the olive trees are so beautiful at this hour: the full light of day is magnificent, but frightening. I find that Cezanne conveyed it well, happily not in its brilliance, which is unbearable.” Light, sure, but not changing light; essential light.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

His allegiance to the supremely local isn’t about identifying with the place, but rather that every rock or tree or house he painted is one he saw. That specificity is what makes his work so profoundly, universally resonant.What makes Cezanne’s paintings so radical is how he arrived, as Coutagne puts it, “like a meteor … Nothing, no one prefigures him.” His oeuvre resolutely denies the illusion of all the figurative painting that came before him. It forces the viewer to reckon with his painted surface, to not be duped into thinking that said painting is a window on to the world.View image in fullscreenCezanne’s Still Life With Cherries and Peaches (1885-87).Photograph: Museum Associates/LACMA. GrandPalaisRmnCezanne’s Lauves studio, which he built in 1901, is a building site when I visit, inaccessible until later in the summer. Fresh apples have usually been displayed here, much like the fresh lemon left on a pewter plate in the Kettle’s Yard gallery in Cambridge, displayed to echo the yellow dot in Joan Miró’s Tic Tic, which hangs on the adjacent wall. But perhaps this is why I’ve never been much inclined to go inside the Lauves studio: with Cezanne, I want to seehisapples – that painted appleness – not fresh fruit. Virginia Woolf once wrote about her sister, Vanessa Bell, persuading John Maynard Keynes to lend them a tiny Cezanne he’d just bought – a 1878 still life of seven apples titled Pommes – because their friend Roger Fry wanted to copy it. “Nessa left the room and reappeared with a small parcel about the size of a large slab of chocolate. On one side are six [sic] apples by Cezanne. Roger very nearly lost his senses. I’ve never seen such a sight of intoxication. He was like a bee on a sunflower. Imagine … us all gloating upon these apples. They really are very superb.”I finish with a visit to Cezanne’s grave in the Saint-Pierre Cemetery. I add a pebble to a few already perched on its aged surface and think about Patti Smith. Her A Book of Days is filled with Polaroids of the headstones of authors she’s visited: Rimbaud, Camus, Woolf, Jean Genet. While you can buy a novel for a tenner or read it for free at a library, visiting a writer’s grave offers something else, something closer to the unique experience of holding a handwritten manuscript or seeing where the writer sat to write it. A painter’s grave though? Standing here, I am both moved and left wanting. It’s his actual paintings I want to see. And to see Cezanne originals, you normally have to go on a grand tour, a modern-day pilgrimage, to the big museums of the world. This July, they are, remarkably, all coming to Aix. So I’m heading home again this summer to see those, too.Cezanne at Jas De Bouffan is at Musée Granet, Aix-en-Provence, France, from 28 June to 12 October.Explore more on these topicsPaul CezanneArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Anyone who’s passed through London’s Charing Cross tube station has seen his life-filled black-and-white mural of medieval people, enlarged from his woodcuts, digging, hammering, chiselling to construct the Eleanor Cross that once stood nearby. His graphic art has graced everything from stamps to book covers toStop the Warposters in a career spanning seven decades. He says he’s been making art for 90 years, since he was five.His parents were also artists, and in his latest book he reproduces a Shell poster by his father to show he follows in a modern British tradition of well-drawn, well-observed popular art. Perhaps it is because he learned from his parents as naturally as learning to speak – “Seeing them drawing tempted me to draw” – that Gentleman dislikes pedagogy. He’s proud that he never had to teach for a living, always selling his art. So his guide to the creative life, Lessons for Young Artists, is anything but a how-to manual or didactic textbook.Instead, it’s like a visit to his studio where you sit at his shoulder, watching him work, while he shares tips, wisdom, anecdotes. If you have ever wished to take up pencil and paper, whatever your age, this book will sharpen your ambition by demystifying the process, making it feel the most natural and important thing in the world to draw that tree outside the window.The book’s beautiful illustrations deepen his laconic advice. As he chats, the artist rifles through drawers to show views of London, Paris, New York. “Rifling” is possibly the wrong word, for it suggests a chaotic workplace, of which Gentleman does not approve. You should keep your brushes in good nick and your studio tidy. Then again there are no rules, he admits, remembering how Edward Ardizzone used to work at the kitchen table surrounded by his family.The artist’s workspace may seem a secondary issue but he’s not alone in stressing it: Leonardo da Vinci paid attention to what an artist’s room should be like in advice to young hopefuls written more than 500 years ago. In one of Gentleman’s engrossing, calming drawings, his studio has a big window looking out on the city, designs on clipboards neatly hung up, a row of brushes, a couple of glasses of water (for watercolours). It’s a workplace to envy, peaceful yet connected with the world. This is really a guide not just to the technical skills an artist needs but achieving an artistic state of mind.Gentleman lures you into his day-to-day work. “Take a sketchbook with you everywhere you go,” he says, again like Leonardo, adding that it should be pocket-sized and the accompanying tools minimal. Too heavy a kit will “become an excuse not to take it with you”.He adds watercolour to his drawings, either in the studio or in the open. A Suffolk church is seen through overgrown late summer weeds, with watery blotches in the sky. It started to rain as he worked: “I like the way the spatters of rain are visible on the paper.” Another happy accident is a drawing of his son playing the piano that acquired an extra foot: a burst of motion in an otherwise tranquil scene.You find yourself not just wanting to be an artist but to be David Gentleman. “Becoming an artist,” he says, “is about learning to look at the world with a very sharp eye. When you walk down the street, try to pause and notice your surroundings.” On the facing page is a watercolour shot through with sunlight of the now-gone King’s Cross gasometers, by a trashy canalside, ducks floating on the silver-touched water. Finding beauty in the neglected, unnoticed moments that pass us by is a lesson that can be applied to anyone’s life, “Young Artist” or not. This is diamond advice, lightly given.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I got the loudest cheerMiles MitchellFri 27 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 07.27 EDTShareWhen I first saw the flyer for the Timothée Chalamet lookalike contest last October, I thought it was a joke. Lookalike contests were not mainstream yet. It was also taking place in New York’s Washington Square Park – a place I usually associate with chaos. But last year aTikTokof me at a London barbershop went viral before because people thought I resembled Timothée. So, a day before the contest, I headed to a charity shop and picked out an outfit that made me look like Timothée’s Willy Wonka. Why not?I was shocked by the size of the crowd on the day. There were thousands there and I was swarmed by people wanting photos. Before the contest even began, the police had arrived to shut it down. We relocated to a nearby park. It was later announced that Timothée had crashed the contest but left when the cops arrived. I missed his visit entirely.Once the contest began, we were asked to complete a series of activities, including a bizarre Timothée-themed Q&A. Eventually, they narrowed down the contestants to me and a lookalike named Zander, who was dressed in a Dune-inspired outfit. Whoever got the loudest cheer would win. At that point, I was pretty calm. I thought Zander had a good shot of winning, too, as he looked a lot like Timothée.After they announced I’d won, hundreds of cameras went off in front of me. The sensory overload was next level. The reporters were aggressively fighting over who would speak to me first. To top it all, I had to walk around Manhattan carrying a 6ft trophy and a massive $50 cheque.View image in fullscreenMiles Mitchell, 21, winner of the Timothée Chalamet lookalike contest, in New York, 2024.Photograph: Stefan Jeremiah/API was invited on famous talkshows, like The Drew Barrymore Show, and fast-food companies reached out to me to film sponsored content. A highlight was attending this year’s Golden Globes. I was with my mum when I received my invitation, via Instagram DM from CBS, which was broadcasting the event. My mum and I both lost it.This would be my second interaction with Timothée, as I had already met him at a screening of the filmA Complete Unknown, which I was also invited to. I had been lucky enough to sit in the front row and when Timothée came out to greet the crowd, I said: “I kind of look like you.” I did not mention the lookalike contest, but he turned to me and asked: “What place did you get?” After I told him, he asked for a photo with me. You’d think it would be the other way round.Before the Golden Globes, CBS flew me out to LA. On landing, I went out for a breakfast burrito, and the waiter told me I looked like Timothée. He was so stunned to learn I was there for winning the lookalike contest that he gave me my meal for free.At the Globes, I walked the red carpet with the winner of the Glen Powell lookalike contest. We stood there for three hours, holding signs that read: “I won a lookalike contest and now I’m at the Golden Globes.” We spent most of the time looking at each other in disbelief, surrounded by the world’s most famous celebrities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But just before the ceremony kicked off, he dashed through the red carpet. He stopped to acknowledge me – something he wasn’t doing for anyone else. For a second time, he asked for a picture. I was grateful as he didn’t have to do that.I watched the ceremony from the trophy engraving room. I took full advantage of the unlimited food and drink, and ate about 30 lamb chops. The voice actor for Moana came up and said, “Oh my god, you won the lookalike contest! Fuck, yeah, you did!” But I didn’t recognise many people who approached me for pictures. The CBS team had to tell me who they were. I’d just think: “Wow, that’s insane.” It was hands-down the best night of my life.Later,Saturday Night Liveasked me to feature me in a promo for a show Timothée was hosting, but I was in Europe and couldn’t make the 12-hour turnaround. They cast someone else who wasn’t even at the contest. I was disappointed, of course, but that’s how this industry works. I’m optimistic about future opportunities, but even if that was the peak, I’m still grateful for all the cool things I got to do.As told to Maria VieiraDo you have an experience to share?

I guess I thought of them as belonging to a wardrobe that didn’t concern me: a world of braces, cravats and flat caps. Of Guy Ritchie films, wedding rentals and carnation buttonholes.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Well, I guess the joke’s on me now, because waistcoats aren’t novelty or naff any more. They are happening, and I need to get up to speed on how to wear them. The waistcoat has entered the fashion chat in the slipstream of the trouser suit. Women have been wearing them for decades, but until the last decade it remained a slightly niche move – not weird or eccentric, just a bit of a statement. It is only in the past few years that suits on women have become unremarkable.These days, women of all stripes wear them: the Princess of Wales, as well as politicians, film stars on the red carpet, brides and moguls and mums. Ahead of the women’s Euros, which kicks off next week, M&S has released a collection for the Lionesses that gives a playful nod to Gareth Southgate’s famous waistcoat. This time around it comes buttoned asymmetrically. The waistcoat is either the third part in the suit look or an alternative to the jacket.It needs to have a simple, round neckline, one that will map neatly on to the neck of a T-shirt, not a V-neckThis waistcoat moment is very different from the last one, whenKate Mosswore them in the 00s. That was an entirely different iteration: a spry, shrunken scrap of a thing, worn with skinny jeans and a ribbed vest. It was very informal, worn either tight and buttoned (no bra) or hanging loose from the shoulders over other layers, almost like a scarf. It was rakish, romantic and a bit Fleetwood Mac.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

This is good when you want the silhouette of a vest top but with more structure.Another plus is that it is one of the few summer outfits that looks just as good when you layer a jacket on top. Any kind of tailored blazer will work well, so long as the necklines of the jacket and waistcoat run parallel, or close (a high-necked waistcoat under a cutaway jacket will get a bit messy, visually). A cardigan definitely can’t go on top, though, or you will look as if you put your clothes on in the wrong order. Cardigan stans might, however, do well to lean into the waistcoat-cardigan hybrid, in the form of a simple front-buttoned knitted tank. I have one I wore between a shirt and a jacket for most of the spring – and which is now working as a summer top on its own, buttoned up with a midi skirt; I’m also planning to take it on holiday as an evening throw-on over spaghetti strap dresses.Zara has a Knitted Topwith gold starburst buttons (£29.99) that’s very pretty.But the waistcoat shape that’s most useful right now is one that can be worn as either a top or a jacket. The key details you are looking for are as follows. First, it needs to have a simple, round neckline, one that will map neatly on to the neck of a T-shirt, not a V-neck. Second, you want one that’s not too skimpy at the shoulder. It should extend to where the shoulder seam of a shirt sits, because that way you can layer it over something with sleeves, if you want to. Third – and I know I’m being a fusspot now but bear with – look for a silhouette that buttons from neck to waist and then opens to a shape that flares at the hip. This will look great worn open as a casual sleeveless jacket, and smart worn buttoned with the belt of your trousers just seen at the waist.Me+Em have aSeam Detail Tailored Waistcoat(£250) that will be a hard-working piece of your everyday wardrobe but, worn fastened with smart white trousers, would be polished enough for Wimbledon or a city wedding.I am also a big fan of Albaray’sSoft Yellow Tailored Waistcoat(£75), which has a chic notched neckline and an adjustable closure at the back of the waist so that you can shape it to suit you. Am I overthinking this? Possibly. Making up for lost time.Explore more on these topicsWomen's coats and jacketsJess Cartner-Morley on fashionKate MossfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Drain the pearls into a sieve, then run them under the cold tap to stop them sticking together.To make the tea syrup, put the sugar, 75ml water and the tea bags in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer, cook for four to five minutes, until the liquid reduces by about a quarter, then remove and discard the tea bags.Turn down the heat to medium-low, add the tapioca, then stir well to coat. Take off the heat and leave to cool in the pan. (You can do this in advance and leave at room temperature overnight.)To make the salted cream, lightly whip the double cream and salt to very soft peaks.To serve, put a spoonful of the tapioca and syrup mix into a sundae glass or ramekin, then swirl it around so some of the syrup coats the inside.

And rather than Paris, where Jonathan Anderson made his Dior debut on Friday, the most powerful person in fashion was in Venice forthe Bezos/Sánchez wedding, shortly afterrelinquishing her roleas editor-in-chief at American Vogue.Unlike the wedding of the year, Anderson’s show proved to be sweet relief for anyone wanting to flex a cooler, chicer muscle. Perched on wooden cubes within the Cour du Dôme des Invalides sat plenty of VIP clout: Daniel Craig, Donatella Versace and Roger Federer. Most of the Arnault family, who ownDiorand routinely joust with Jeff Bezos over who has more money, were present. Even Rihanna, pregnant in a Dior pastel waistcoat, was relatively punctual.View image in fullscreenA$AP Rocky and Rihanna attend the Dior Homme spring/summer 2026 collection in Paris.Photograph: Christophe Ena/APAnderson is known for his sharp eye and crafty, mercurial taste – few people have shaped the red carpet and ultimately the high street into the hype machine it is today. But Dior is a different challenge. As the first creative director of menswear and womenswear since Christian Dior himself, the designer needs to revamp LVMH’s second biggest brand, with estimated revenues far greater than at his former label, Loewe.“I can’t stand here and say I’m not nervous, that it is not petrifying,” he said backstage before the show, wearing his trademark Levi’s and a plaid Dior shirt. “Dior is on billboards. It’s on Rihanna. It’s transcendent. But this is the starting point – I’ve been here four months, and the first five shows will show different aspects. Some will contradict; others will be completely radical.”Some designers get critical acclaim, others sell a lot of clothes – a rare few have a talent to do both, but that’s the hope with Anderson. Because of tariff wars and a decline in the luxury market, LVMH shares have halved from their 2023 peak. “Delphine [Arnault] and I, we talked about changing the quality, about upping the game,” Anderson said.Opening the show was a bar jacket in Donegal tweed. More interested in how a look is put together than the clothes themselves, Anderson styled it with a pair of thick cream cargo shorts cut from 15 metres of fabric and layered up like a Viennetta. Knitted vests were a through line, as were ties and neck ruffles, and plenty of colour – greens, pinks and blues. Dior, he says, is a house of colour, in part because it offsets the “house grey” that features on billboards, Dior clothes labels he redesigned and the Parisian sky.View image in fullscreenThere was plenty of colour in the menswear show – including pink and green – and a preppy, eccentric look.Photograph: Christophe Ena/APA puffer gilet was circularly cut and placed over a formal shirt, while summer coats and capes came knitted or in pleated bright colours. One was even based on an original Dior shape “that would have cost the equivalent of a Ferrari”, except here it was styled with trainers. There were even jeans – skinny and baggy, in indigo and green. The look was preppy and eccentric, with shades of Loewe, JW Anderson, and even Uniqlo in the puffers, among the classic Dior shapes.On Anderson’s original moodboard were Warholian images of the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and the socialite Lee Radziwill, alongside classic Dior dresses such as the Delft and Cigale. The idea was to take each look into the present, “to recontextualise it”, he said. He even took his predecessor Maria Grazia Chiuri’s book bag totes and put a “new skin” on them, in the form of Dracula and Les Liaisons Dangereuses. It’s these hyperspecific references that give Anderson’s work a pleasing temporality, and will no doubt sell well – here at Dior, and whatever high street shop will no doubt copy him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Last year, in the interest of sustainable fashion, Ijoined a pledge only to buy five new pieces of clothing. Despite thinking of myself as someone who doesn’t really shop, I found the restriction a real chore. Unless you’re buying vintage or spending a fortune, the dilemma of how to engage in the fun and newness of fashion without contributing to its environmental footprint is, it turns out, nearly universal: data in a new report reveals 74% of people want to dress more sustainably but most don’t know how to go about it.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The report – released by multi-brand retailer Zalando – found that 39% of consumers find sustainable garments too expensive and 27% say they are hard to identify. It’s little wonder sustainable fashion remains plagued by vague claims, convoluted supply chains and a call-out culture that’s left brands reluctant to promote initiatives to customers on the lookout for greenwashing.“People are more engaged than they’re often given credit for,” says Pascal Brun, Zalando’s vice-president of sustainability and D&I. Almost two decades after sustainable fashion entered mainstream discourse, most people have some awareness of the industry’s environmental impact – carbon emissions, pollution of waterways, deforestation, microplastics, waste. They probably also know these ill effects are exacerbated by the sheer volume of product being made every year (somewhere between 80 and 150bn garments) and the increasing proportion derived from fossil-fuel based fabrics (polyester accounted for57% of all fibres in 2024).The rising popularity of ultra-cheap, ultra-fast fashion brands such as Shein and Temu (the targets of French legislation passed last week) brings the dilemma into stark focus. Yet this new data reveals, despite everyone’s best intentions, it’s not clear where and how to shop with a reduced impact. So, how does one buy reasonably priced, sustainable clothes?View image in fullscreenA ThredUp warehouse in the US.Photograph: Matt York/APThe starting point is, of course, vintage – sales of which happily, according toThredUp’s Annual Resale Report, grew by 15% in 2024. Data from eBay suggests users search for “vintage” items more than 1,200 times a minute. But given the constraints on sizing and the time required to sift through racks, second-hand clothing isn’t always practical.When buying new clothes, context is important, says author and fashion educator Andrea Cheong. “What is financially accessible to people is going to vary, as is what is sustainable.” So rather than focusing on brands, she suggests buying the best quality of the item your budget can accommodate. That way, you will actually wear it. To assess quality, apply three criteria. First, buy nothing that contains a synthetic or semi-synthetic blend. Second, the garment must look as good on the inside as it does on the outside (small stitches, neat seams, non-synthetic lining). And third, it must be fit for purpose (leggings that are supportive enough for a workout, coats that keep you warm, pockets deep and sturdy enough to hold your phone).Detail is your friend. Garments made from a single, natural fibre (100% cotton, linen or wool) are easier to recycle and generally more durable. If a brand is using sustainable materials, they will tell you about it – and provide the nitty-gritty; specificity is the enemy ofgreenwashing. Look for third-party certifications that promote safe use of chemicals including Bluesign and Oeko-Tex, or regenerative or organic farming practices such as the Responsible Wool Standard and the Global Organic Textile Standard (Gots), or the inclusion of recycled content like the Global Recycled Standard.Similarly, if a brand has engaged suppliers with closed-loop systems (to recycle water and chemicals) and renewable energy, who are paying a living wage, they will include this detail, as well – most notably – as the location of the factory on their website. This is a detail that reveals a level of trust, transparency and confidence. In addition, brands get bonus points for having repair, rental and resale programmes.When building a sustainable wardrobe, it’s important to take a long view. Cheong suggests reinvesting in the clothes you already own by having them professionally altered or learning how to repair them.Sojo, for example work with brands such as M&S, Reiss and Selfridges.But this isn’t always practical. When it truly is time to buy something new, there are several UK-based brands producing garments that are gentle both on your bank balance and the planet.

The 58-year-old carer had some stark words for Which?, who conducted the survey.“I think it’s a bit of snobbery,” she said. “You need to come down and see it for yourself, don’t rely on so-called reports.”The consumer group, which said it surveyed more than 3,800 people about their travel experiences in the last year, ranked theWest Sussextown last in its annual list of the UK’s best and worst seaside destinations.Bamburgh in Northumberland took top spot in the survey, while nearby Tynemouth ranked sixth. Beer in Devon, on the Jurassic coast, came in second.But Smith was full of praise for Bognor. Drying off on the pebbles and undeterred by the heavy winds, she said: “There’s so much here, the sea is amazing. There’s loads of places to eat as well, whether you’ve got a tenner or 100 quid to spend.”View image in fullscreenJulia Smith: ‘There’s so much here, the sea is amazing.’Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianAnd that was the dream from the beginning, when Sir Richard Hotham decided to use his vast wealth, obtained by managing ships for the east India company, to realise his vision of a seaside resort in the late 18th century.He died before a railway line sent demand soaring throughout the following century, bringing with it boarding houses and amusement arcades. And then, in 1960, came Butlin’s, the seal of authenticity for any British leisure location.Smith, who has lived in the town for almost 20 years, was full of kind words, but she recognised some of its setbacks. “The shopping not’s great. But do you come to the seaside for the shopping or do you come for the sea?” she asked.Regardless, she is not leaving any time soon. “We live here and we never get sick of it. I’m going on 60 but I love it.”Those nipping to the seaside for a midweek break were equally surprised by its ranking. “Everyone’s welcomed us with a smile. It’s welcoming and friendly,” said Nabil Awan, 39, visiting with friends to celebrate his 40th birthday.View image in fullscreenNabil Awan (right) and friends.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThey had just arrived but first impressions were positive. “The beach is really clean,” he said. “I’m sure there’s probably worse places.”Ray Craddock, 85, moved to the town recently from the Midlands to be closer to his children, who live in the south-east. So far, he’s impressed. “It’s alive. It’s not fantastic in everything it’s got, but it’s a happy town. Most of the people you talk to are quite pleasant. We’re enjoying it,” he said.He called on people to “come and look” for themselves. “It’s easy for somebody to say ‘oh yes, I’ve heard it’s bad’, but they’ve never actually been here,” he said. “How do you judge what is good and what isn’t? There’s always snobbery.”He added: “People will think we’re stupid but we’re sitting here with a nice breeze and enjoying the sea.”View image in fullscreenRay and Heather Craddock: ‘It’s not fantastic in everything it’s got, but it’s a happy town,’ Ray said.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianHis wife, Heather Craddock, 82, was similarly dismissive of the report. “I disagree,” she said. Despite the bad press the town sometimes gets, tourists have seemingly not been deterred. “There’s loads of people down here,” she added.As part of the survey, each location was graded one to five in 11 categories, which was converted into a “destination score”. Bognor Regis received the lowest score, of 36%. In second-to-last place was Bangor, with a score of 38%.Bognor Regis was given one star for food and drink, tourist attractions, scenery, shopping, parking, peace and quiet, value for money and its seafront and pier.View image in fullscreenBognor has also been crowned as the sunniest place in Britain.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianIt is not the first time the town has been given the dubious honour, having been ranked last in the same survey in 2019 and 2022.Bognor is due to get a makeover. West Sussex county council has announced £40m in funding to regenerate the town’s seafront with improvements to the esplanade being completed last month.Historically, it was the temporary abode of an ill King George V, and the place where James Joyce began writing Finnegans Wake. Jane Austen’s unfinished novel Sanditon is thought to be set in the town.It has also been crowned by the Met Office as the sunniest place in Britain, with more than 1,900 hours of sunshine a year.Standing beside the historic pier, which was opened in 1865, Awan and his friends were in unanimous agreement that they would give it at least three stars. “There are better piers in the UK but it’s not a one star,” he said.Explore more on these topicsWest SussexEngland holidaysTravel & leisureEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The scenery is awesome: pointed white, limestone peaks above deep and mysterious pine-forested valleys. The books of mountaineer Julius Kugy romantically describe this large wilderness, the obscurity of which amazes me. Nature is abundant with various large mammals, bird life and flora. If you love alpine adventure but don’t like tourists then seek it out, there’s nobody there!PaulAlone with orchids and sea birds, SwedenView image in fullscreenSunset on Stora Karlsö, one of the world’s oldest nature reserves.Photograph: Johner Images/AlamyStora Karlsö, off the west coast of Gotland, is one of the oldest nature reserves in the world and is a few hours’ journey by train and ferry from Stockholm. It’s a tiny, rugged limestone island, mostly just a high cliff with an alvar (grassy heath) plateau. There were lots of orchids and plenty of sea birds. Once sheltered from the wind, I found the fragrant air was incredible. I spent the night in a simple cabin and enjoyed a decent meal, but civilisation in the regular fashion was far away, and there was hardly any cell reception.LindaProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

The beaten track was busy, so we took every opportunity to deviate off it along alternative sections. Walking across the Meseta, the expansive, high central plateau famed for its isolation, we took the detour from Calzada del Coto to Mansilla de las Mulas along the Via Trajana, the old, cobbled Roman road. We were surrounded by birdsong, wildflowers and the ghosts of legionaries. Apart from when we stopped for a comfortable night and an immense breakfast at theVia Trajana hostelin Calzadilla de los Hermanillos, we only saw two other people in two days and 20 miles of walking.RichardBears and wolves in the Romanian forestView image in fullscreenA brown bear in the Carpathian forest.Photograph: Roland Brack/AlamyThe Carpathian forests of Romania, flanked by brooding mountains, are a brilliant place to lose yourself for a couple of weeks. On my hiking trip there last summer I spotted brown bears, wolves and lynx as I marched through valleys and woods. I came across medieval towns and villages that are rich in traditional folklore. One highlight was sampling local cheese and singing songs with villagers in the Barza valley. I was rewarded – or punished – for my musical efforts with a bumpy ride on a horse-drawn cart to the next village. Don’t miss a walk up to Postăvarul peak (1,800 metres) for great views over the area.JoeA hike through Iceland’s myriad landscapesView image in fullscreenThe Thórsmörk valley.Photograph: Oleh_Slobodeniuk/Getty ImagesThirty-five miles and three nights in mountain huts in the southern highlands of Iceland: theLaugavegur trailis a microcosm of the landscapes of that incredible country.

The coveted outdoor kitchenIn my mind, they are associated with Guides’ camps and fixed barbecue grills that languish unwashed – but it seems that I am in the minorityAlice VincentFri 27 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 12.53 EDTShareThis week, I read that Joa Studholme, Farrow & Ball’s colour curator, was predicting the onslaught of butter yellow paint in our homes a decade ago, when everyone was still furiously coating their walls in “mizzle” grey. I marvelled at both her foresight and the comfortingly glacial pace of interior design trends. But if interiors trends are slow, I’d argue gardening ones are even slower.One of the trends that comes up persistently is the outdoor kitchen. In my mind, they are associated with Guides’ camps and fixed barbecue grills that are used once then languish unwashed until the entire shenanigan unfolds again the following summer.But I’ve realised I’m alone in this: garden designer Pollyanna Wilkinson, whose bookHow to Design a Gardenis full of invaluable advice, tells me 99% of her clients have requested one in recent years: “They’re popular as they allow you to be sociable – if you’re hosting outside, you can remain with them while cooking.”Though not cheap, the Big Green Egg is an aesthetically pleasing, low-impact solution for outdoor diningWhile I do host a lot, I can never be bothered to offer more than drinks outside; it’s such a faff to carry everything in and out, and food can quickly go cold outdoors.But if you are dedicated to alfresco hosting (and have a four- or even five-figure budget), top-end outdoor kitchens provide work surfaces with built-in barbecues, sinks, wired-in fridges and beer taps. Ideally, it would be integrated with its surroundings, reflecting the materials used in your home or garden.Things to think about if considering one of these include checking where the sun will be in the evenings (now is a good time to do this; it will be in a different position come autumn or winter) and how your planting will fit the area. Softening the utilities with elegant grasses and perennial colour will make a massive difference. Salvias are a good place to start, as they keep colour coming from midsummer through to November.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

They were alarmed about the imminent threat the weapons posed for themselves and for their children, theylater said.More than 40 years on, the prospect of American nuclear weapons stationed on British soilhas returnedwith urgent focus. And for some of the women who were at theGreenham Common women’s peace camp, it is time for dissenting UK citizens to rise up again.In the wake of the UK government’s announcement this week that it plans to significantly expand its nuclear arsenal by buying a squadron of American fighter jets capable of carrying US tactical warheads, key figures at Greenham hope a new generation of campaigners will take up the baton.View image in fullscreenThe UK government has said it plans to buy 12 Lockheed Martin F-35A fighter jets.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersAnn Pettitt, now 78, devised the original idea for a march that led to the formation of the camp. At its height, more than 70,000 women were there and it became the biggest female-led protest sincewomen’s suffrage. It was, as Pettitt says, “actually successful” in managing to hugely raise awareness of the presence of US nuclear warheads in the UK – the last of which left RAF Lakenheath in 2008. The camp went on after the Greenham Common missiles had gone in 1991 and the base was closed in 1992. The remaining campaigners leftGreenham Commonafter exactly 19 years.Pettitt said this week’s news had left her “disillusioned” but she was hopeful that a younger generation would protest. “It certainly calls for protest, because it’s so stupid,” she said. “Nuclear weapons are like the emperor’s new clothes, they can’t be used and if they are they backfire because of radiation spreads and they target civilians. We should simply not have them.”Thedecision to buy 12 F-35A jets, which are capable of carrying conventional arms and also the US B61-12 gravity bomb, a variant of which has more than three times the explosive power of the Hiroshima bomb, has energised the anti-nuclear movement, said Sophie Bolt, the general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.View image in fullscreenAt its height, more than 70,000 women were at Greenham Common, and it became the biggest female-led protest since women’s suffrage.Photograph: PAThe group has organised a protest onSaturday at RAF Marham in Norfolk, and Bolt said Greenham women – many of whom are in their 70s – still form the “backbone” of the resistance.“These are women who have got a huge history and totally understand how high the stakes are,” she said. “Their determination, creativity and strategic thinking is just really incredible. They are a massive inspiration and so enriching to the campaign.”Anti-arms groups plan mass protests over expansion of UK nuclear deterrentRead moreOne of those women, Angie Zelter, 74, went on to found the civil disobedience campaign Snowball and the anti-nuclear weapons groupTrident Ploughshares. In 2019, aged 68, she was found guilty of a minor public order offence forprotesting with Extinction Rebellion. “We had a saying, ‘carry Greenham home’, and from the moment I was there that’s what I’ve done,” she said.But Zelter said it was also time for a new generation of Greenham women. “I think we need a new women’s movement, but I think actually we need everybody to rise up, quite frankly. All we can do as elders is support younger activists and give advice, solidarity and support.”View image in fullscreenAngie Zelter: ‘It is a moment of hope that people will realise that they’ve got to come together and protest loud and clearly.’Photograph: Francesca Jones/The ObserverThere was no time for squabbles in despondency, she added. “I hope it is a moment of mass realisation when we come together now and say, look, enough is enough … It is a moment of hope that people will realise that they’ve got to come together and protest loud and clearly.”Pettitt said those not ready to man the barricades could still join the struggle – by the simple act of writing a letter to MPs to protest about the “outrageous” decision to buy the jets without parliamentary debate. “The way to get it discussed in parliament is to write your MP a letter,” she said. “Parliament is still very archaic … the humble letter is part of that kind of archaic functioning that is surprisingly effective.”Another original walker, Sue Lent, now 73 and a councillor on Cardiff council, said the general public had lost sight of the anti-nuclear movement, but she hoped that a silver lining from the news this week was that younger and older activists would start “joining the dots”.“1981 is a long time ago,” she said. “But hopefully the spirit still lives on and can be revived.”Explore more on these topicsGreenham CommonAnti-war movementNuclear weaponsProtestDefence policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s not just because I’m a fading redhead with fair skin, freckles, vitiligo and a need for factor 50 protection. I enjoy feeling warm to my bones as much as anyone. Today, the world is hotter than it was when I was a child. I’m now 68 and science has been predicting ahotter climatefor many years. People around the world aredyingbecause they are overheating.Does anyone care? The opportunity to build in human-centred solutions to warming is being missed – for example, into urban housing and for vulnerable people, so we are incredibly underprepared for the human tragedy being forecast by scientists. I’m worried for my children and grandchildren. What kind of world are we building?It’s one thing to build in public announcements about how people can stay cool in the heat – obvious things like hydration, sunscreen and keeping curtains closed. ThePhysiological Society’s roadmapfor dealing with climate change points the way for multidisciplinary approaches to finding solutions for policymakers and infrastructure, but I fear that the current emphasis on mitigating warmongering means that long‑term heat-related challenges are being ignored.Dr Laura M GinesiYaxham, NorfolkWhile much of England has been sweltering under amber heat warnings, another crisis is quietly intensifying: wildfires are fast becoming Britain’s most overlooked climate emergency. Already this year,more than 560 wildfireshave been recorded in England and Wales – a sevenfold rise on the same period in 2024. From scorched moorland to motorway verges, fire crews are stretched to breaking point. Many blazes are caused by disposable barbecues, cigarettes or littered glass – small acts with catastrophic consequences. Peatlands and woodlands, vital carbon sinks and havens for biodiversity, are being destroyed acre by acre.Yet we have no national wildfire strategy. No consistent bans on open fires during high-risk periods. And fire services, cut to the bone, are being left to improvise in the face of this new normal. This is no longer a Mediterranean problem. Without urgent national action, the UK will face a cycle of summer infernos. Ministers must restore funding to fire services, introduce fire-source bans during alerts and establish a properly resourced wildfire response plan. Anything less is climate complacency.Antony David DaviesShrewsbury, ShropshireThe way in which the media positively presents extremely hot and dangerous weather using words such as “beautiful” and “lovely sunny day” infuriates me. Such descriptions are personal value judgments and should be kept out of objective reporting. All that can be said objectively is that it is hot. My immune system struggles to cope with the heat because of medication to help prevent the recurrence of breast cancer. High temperatures and humidity leave me exhausted and forced to seek refuge indoors. I long for more benign weather, days where I can go about my normal life without being forced to opt out until it passes.The binary view that hot weather equals good and cold/wet weather equals bad must be readdressed in light of current climate challenges if we are to stand any chance of persuading everyone to do their bit to protect the environment.Helen PeeblesStamford, LincolnshireThe recentreport by the Met Officethat temperature highs of 45C are now possible in the UK shows how quickly we are sliding into new and wholly terrifying climatic territory. Talk of adaptation and resilience is beside the point – we need emergency decarbonisation to slow the growth of extreme heat, and to salvage something of the climate niche within which human societies have grown and thrived.Jason Scott-WarrenCambridgeExplore more on these topicsExtreme heatExtreme weatherSummerClimate crisisWildfiresUK weatherMet OfficelettersShareReuse this content"

Trust leaders will welcome proposals to introduce one clear set of actions to improve care across everyNHSmaternity service.Saffron CorderyDeputy chief executive, NHS ProvidersAfter a number of years overseeing maternity and perinatal services at regional level, this proposal frustrates me. The inquiry is purely politically motivated and will not add any value to the women, babies and families affected previously or who may be in the future.Multiple strategic transformation programmes have been commissioned and funded. There is nothing new to discover; obstetricians focus on healthy babies, midwives focus on happy mothers. The medical v social models of care make this an impossible divide, not helped by either group frequently failing to listen and respond effectively to women’s concerns.Perhaps when there are sufficient staff to work together as a team, and we place the woman at the centre of care and an effective digital infrastructure is in place to support effective communication, instead of focusing on the either/or approach of “high risk” v “low risk”, we might get somewhere.Ann PearsonGatley, CheshireWe do not need another review of failing maternity services. The national service development funding (SDF) for maternity serviceswill be cutfrom £95m in 2024-25 to just £2m in 2025-26.The patriarchyrulesand as a consequence misogyny sets the tone for maternity care.Why else would there be gynaecology beds for women experiencing miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy or termination on a postnatal ward?Zoe GreenLondonAlthough failures in maternity care are of great concern, rather than simply chasing after the evidence of what failures look like and castigating those accused of “passing the buck”, perhapsWes Streetingshould also look at the 10 best performing units to find out what they do and how they achieve success.

The Department of Health and Social Care said that genomics and AI would be used to “revolutionise prevention” and provide faster diagnoses and an “early warning signal for disease”.In line withprevious predictions, when individuals who submitted to a PCR test (which amplifies genetic material) during Covid-19 had their DNA sold for profit without their consent, infants now face their private, personal, biological data being captured, stored and used by who-knows-what corporations on behalf of the NHS.Not everyone wants to know what potential diseases they might suffer from in the future, especially if there is no known treatment. And for what purposes might it be used, other than “prediction of disease risk”? Testing of new drugs? Testing of vaccines? Clearly an infant cannot give consent to its DNA being used for these purposes and research on children isunethical unless they stand to benefit. Will parents have the opportunity to give informed consent and can it even be informed if they are unaware of the many potential uses of the material?A globalgenomics marketof $32.65bn in 2023 suggests that this is big business.Genomics England already makes available patients’ genomic datato businesses.The association with AI additionally raises the spectre of surveillance in the form of digital IDs, incorporating not only biometric data, such as fingerprints, retinal scans and facial recognition, but potentially even the human genome itself. The NHSdata of 57 million patientshas already been used to train AI outside of the intended purpose.Will doctors recognise these risks and take steps to inform patients?

The media get viewers, readers or clicks (money); the scientist potentially gets interest that leads to longer tenure or funding. The public gets confused when a report is later refuted or overturned.Universities and the scientists employed by them used to be largely government-funded and independent of industry and politics. Now they are competing for government and private funds and are willing to muddy the waters around hypotheses, preliminary findings and peer-reviews. By doing so they are playing into the hands of anti-science groups.Scientists are now as market-oriented as any other professionals, and it isn’t doing society any good. Why believe climate science when the boffins can’t even agree on how Covid-19 arose?Steven LeeFaulconbridge, New South Wales, AustraliaJane Qiu makes a lot of excellent points. But it is not fair to imply that blame for mistrust in science lies with scientists themselves.It lies with the populist right, and decades of sustained and largely baseless attacks on scientific integrity. Climate denial, anti-vaxxing and lockdown scepticism are three major examples. As well as manufacturing doubt, these bad actors remove any nuance from public debate – reducing complex issues to a binary shouting match.Meanwhile, climate denial has taught us that even statements in private emails can be ripped out of context and splashed across the global media, to promote a false narrative. In such an environment, any communication with the public on contentious issues is a minefield, and it is hardly surprising that many conscientious scientists avoid it.Scientists need to communicate openly and honestly with the public, but we need support from the media, challenging anti-science voices instead of platforming them. Only then can we achieve the sort of thoughtful and honest discussion of scientific evidence that the public deserves.Dr Richard MilneEdinburghHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

In a major escalation this year, the M23 rebel group made a rapid territorial advance against the Congolese military and its allies in eastern DRC in fighting thatkilled thousandsand displaced hundreds of thousands.“They were going at it for many years, and with machetes – it is one of the worst, one of the worst wars that anyone has ever seen,” Trump said before the signing ceremony.He went on to say: “We’re getting, for the United States, a lot of the mineral rights from the Congo as part of it. They’re so honoured to be here. They never thought they’d be coming.”Congo’s foreign minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner highlighted the agreement’s promises of a respect for sovereignty.“By signing this agreement, we reaffirm a simple truth. Peace is a choice, but also a responsibility to respect international law, to uphold human rights and to protect sovereignty of states,” she said.M23 is among more than 100 armed groups fighting against Congolese forces in the mineral-rich eastern DRC. The group, which is led by Tutsis, says it exists to protect the interests of minorities such as the Tutsis, including protecting them from Hutu rebel groups who escaped to the DRC after taking part in the 1994 genocide that targeted the Tutsis.The DRC, the UN, the US and other countries say the militia is supported byRwanda. UN experts say Rwanda uses the group to extract and export valuable minerals – a claim Rwanda denies.Rwanda has also denied directly supporting the rebels and has demanded an end to another armed group, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which was established by ethnic Hutus linked to the massacres of Tutsis in the genocide.The agreement signed on Friday calls for the “neutralisation” of the FDLR.Map of M23 areas of operations in DRCIn a joint statement before the signing, the three countries said the agreement would include “respect for territorial integrity and a prohibition of hostilities” and the disarmament of all “non-state armed groups”.The statement also spoke of a “regional economic integration framework” and of a future summit in Washington bringing together Trump, the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, and the DRC president, Félix Tshisekedi.The deal has come under scrutiny for its vagueness, including on the economic component, with the Trump administration eager to profit from abundant mineral wealth in eastern DRC.The agreement aims to attract western investment to the two countries’ mining sectors, which contain deposits of tantalum, gold, cobalt, copper and lithium, while giving the US access to critical minerals.Rwandan talks with US over deported migrants are chance to expand its influenceRead moreDenis Mukwege, a gynaecologist who shared the 2018 Nobel peace prize for his work to end the DRC’s epidemic of sexual violence in war, last week said the mediation process was “opaque”, failed to talk about justice and reparations and avoided “recognition of Rwanda’s aggression against the DRC”.Calling for justice and reparations, he saidon social media: “In its current state, the emerging agreement would amount to granting a reward for aggression, legitimising the plundering of Congolese natural resources, and forcing the victim to alienate their national heritage by sacrificing justice in order to ensure a precarious and fragile peace.”Reuters andAgence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaAfricaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpMiningnewsShareReuse this content"

That number is projected to rise to 435 million, or nearly 60% of the world’s extreme poor, by 2030.”The number of deaths in wars and conflicts across the world was stable before the 2008 banking crisis, which forced many developing countries to cut back welfare and education programmes to pay for rising debt payments.The report said the average number of such fatalities was about 50,000 between 2000 and 2004 and even lower between 2005 and 2008, but then there was an increase to more than 150,000 in 2014. Since the pandemic the number of deaths in conflict has averaged 200,000, reaching more than 300,000 in 2022.“For the last three years, the world’s attention has been on the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and this focus has now intensified,” said Indermit Gill, the World Bank Group’s chief economist.“Yet more than 70% of people suffering from conflict and instability are Africans. Untreated, these conditions become chronic. Half of the countries facing conflict or instability today have been in such conditions for 15 years or more. Misery on this scale is inevitably contagious.”He said of the 39 economies currently classified as facing conflict or instability, 21 are in active conflict.Several major donors to investment programmes across the developing world have reduced their funding in recent years, including the UK and the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, in economies facing conflict or instability the rate is nearly 40%.The 39 countries have a rate of national income per head of $1,500 (£1,282) a year, “which has barely budged since 2010 – even as GDP per capita has more than doubled to an average of $6,900 in other developing economies,” the report said.Joining the army of local militia can also be an attractive option for young men and women. In 2022, the latest year for which such data was available, more than 270 million people were of working age in these economies, yet fewer than half were employed.“The global community must pay greater attention to the plight of these economies,” said M Ayhan Kose, the World Bank Group’s deputy chief economist.“Jumpstarting growth and development here will not be easy, but it can be done – and it has been done before. With targeted policies and stronger international support, policymakers can prevent conflict, strengthen governance, accelerate growth, and create jobs.”Explore more on these topicsWorld BankAfricaEconomicsGlobal economyPovertyFood securityPhilanthropynewsShareReuse this content"

The report said the hacker also “used Mexico City’s camera system to follow the [FBI official] through the city and identify people the [official] met with”.The report said “the cartel used that information to intimidate and, in some instances, kill potential sources or cooperating witnesses”.The report did not identify the alleged hacker, attaché or victims.The US embassy in Mexico referred questions to the state and justice departments, who did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The FBI and a lawyer for Guzmán did not immediately return messages seeking comment.The collection of granular location data from people’s phones by a wide variety of commercial and official actors, combined with ever-growing coverage of surveillance cameras, has posed a thorny problem for intelligence and law enforcement officials, many of whom rely on confidential informants.The report said that recent technological advances “have made it easier than ever for less-sophisticated nations and criminal enterprises to identify and exploit vulnerabilities” in the global surveillance economy.It said the FBI had a strategic plan in the works for mitigating those vulnerabilities and made several recommendations, including more training for bureau personnel.Explore more on these topicsMexicoDrugs tradeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

On Wednesday, days before his trial was set to begin, he pleaded guilty to four federal counts, related to accusations that he helped lead a drug-trafficking group within the Venezuelan government.“Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios was once one of the most powerful men inVenezuela. For years, he and other officials … used cocaine as a weapon – flooding New York and other American cities with poison,” said US attorney Jay Clayton.Venezuela’s ex-spy chief extradited from Spain to US to face drug chargesRead moreCarvajal turned against Maduro in 2019 and supported a failed coup that year led by the opposition leader Juan Guaidó. Maduro stayed in power but the Trump administration at the time recognized Guaidó as the legitimate leader of the country.Despite his opposition to Maduro, Carvajal was already under investigation by the US government: in 2020, the justice department released an indictment against him and other top Venezuelan leaders – including Maduro himself – accusing them of narco-terrorism crimes and of running the Cartel of the Suns. He waseventually extraditedto the US from Spain in 2023.The USindictmentalleges that from 1999 through 2020, Maduro, Carvajal and top government officials “participated in a corrupt and violent narco-terrorism conspiracy” between the Cartel of the Suns and the former Colombian rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), to traffic cocaine to the US. The Farc was previously classified as a terrorist organization by the US government before most of its memberslaid down their weaponsin a historic 2016 peace process.Although the US government claims the Cartel of the Suns is a structured and government-run drug-trafficking group,analysts claimthat it is more of a “network of networks” of various drug-trafficking groups protected by elements within the Venezuelan state.The Miami Herald, citing unnamed sources,reportedthat Carvajal was potentially collaborating with the US government to provide information about Maduro’s drug-trafficking activities, theTren de Araguagang and Venezuela’s ties to Iran.Details of his potential collaboration may be revealed during his sentencing hearing in October. He is facing life in prison for each count.Co-defendants in the Cartel of the Suns case include Maduro, the Venezuelan interior minister and two former Farc leaders –including one who was killed in amysterious operationby the Colombian military.As one of the last Latin America-related acts of the Biden administration this January, the US governmentraised its bounty for Maduroand hisinterior ministerto $25m, related to the narco-terrorism case.‘His head wasn’t in the world of reality’: how the plot to invade Venezuela fell apartRead moreOne of Carvajal’s co-defendants was sentenced last year to more than 21 years in prison. Cliver Alcalá , a former Venezuelan general who opposed Maduro, pleaded guilty in 2023 for providing support to the Farc.This case has the potential to uncover details of US operations in Venezuela, including information about alleged US-backed attempts to oust Maduro.In a letter to the New York court, Alcalá’s attorneys have claimed that the Central Intelligence Agency, Drug Enforcement Administration, and national security council were aware of afumbled 2020 plotto overthrow Maduro.That failed plot, deemed the Bay of Piglets, was foiled by Venezuelan security forces.

Heavily armed gangs have brought chaos to its capital, Port-au-Prince, since launching an insurrection that toppled the prime minister last year. On Tuesday, the US embassy in Haiti urged US citizens to abandon the violence-stricken Caribbean country. “Depart Haiti as soon as possible,” it wrote on X.But less than 72 hours later, on Friday afternoon, the Department for Homeland Security – which is at the heart of Donald Trump’s hardline migration crackdown - said it believed it was “safe for Haitian citizens to return home” and announced their protections were being withdrawn.Haitians fear the imminent fall of Port-au-Prince to rebel gangs: ‘We will die standing’Read more“The environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home,” a DHS spokesperson claimed as it was announced that an estimated 521,000 Haitians would be stripped of their “temporary protected status” (TPS) on 2 September this year.“This decision restores integrity in our immigration system and ensures that temporary protective status is actually temporary,” the spokesperson said.The decision sparked an immediate outcry. Tessa Petit, the executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition and a Haitian immigrant,told Newsweek: “I’m still in shock, but I’m totally disgusted. This is a complete lie stating that the situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home. This is a lie.”The TPS program was created by US lawmakers in 1990 and was initially used to offer protection to those fleeingEl Salvador’s 12-year civil war during which more than 75,000 people were killed. Since then it has been used to offer shelter to citizens of countries such as Afghanistan, Somalia, Ukraine and Venezuela. Haitians were first offered TPS status after the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that devastated Port-au-Prince in 2010, claiming tens of thousands of lives.It is unclear how the DHS reached its conclusion that Haiti was now “safe”. Experts saymore than 80% of the capital has been commandeered by violent, politically connected gangsin recent years, with the gang-controlled roads in and out of Port-au-Prince now considered too dangerous to travel. International carriers including American Airlines stopped flying into the city’s airport after several flights came under fire in late 2024.The US state department describes Haiti as a “level four” destination which citizens are advised not to visit “due to kidnapping, crime, civil unrest, and limited health care”.Its website warns: “Crimes involving firearms are common in Haiti. They include robbery, carjackings, sexual assault, and kidnappings for ransom. Kidnapping is widespread, and US citizens have been victims and have been hurt or killed … Mob killings and assaults by the public have increased, including targeting those suspected of committing crimes.”The UK Foreign Office also warns against all travel to Haiti because of the “unpredictable” security situation and the threat of kidnapping and gang violence.“Road travel is highly dangerous. Armed carjacking is common and criminal groups often use improvised road blocks to extort or kidnap motorists,” it says.Explore more on these topicsHaitiAmericasUS immigrationTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Nearly a quarter of Harvard’s students come from outside the US and are a key source of funding for the school.Harvard has so far won two preliminaryinjunctions against the DHS, probably clearing a path for international students to obtain entry visas.“These are exceptional times,” Janice Stein, the founding director of the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, said in a statement.What it’s really like … to know I’m going to miss my Harvard graduation because of Trump’s travel banRead more“If Harvard Kennedy School international students are not able to complete their studies in Cambridge, Mass., the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy looks forward to providing shared academic and co-curricular experiences for students from both our schools.”In addition to the HKS at Munk School program, the schools also announced HKS Global, which will have both an online and in-person component.Harvard students attending the University of Toronto will still have to apply for Canadian study permits and would be enrolled as full-time, non-degree students at the Munk school. The future program is only open to students who have already completed a year of study the United States.Canada has put its own cap on international students and curtailed the number of visas it will issue.

But is ‘self-deportation’ really becoming a thing?Read moreNoviello, who first entered the US in 1988 with a legal visa status and became a permanent resident (green card holder) three years later, was taken into Ice custody on 15 May.He was convicted of multiple drug charges, including racketeering and drug trafficking in Volusia county, Florida, and sentenced to 12 months in prison in 2023.On May 15, he was arrested by Ice and deemed removable from the US because of the controlled substance convictions, the statement said.Canada’s foreign minister, Anita Anand,posted on Xthat the Canadian authorities had been notified of Noviello’s death while in custody in the US and Canadian consular officials “are urgently seeking more information from US officials”.Noviello is the ninth person to die in Ice custody this year, and the fourth to die in a Florida facility,according to the Miami Herald.“Ice remains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments,” the agency said in its statement, adding that “at no time during detention is a detained illegal alien denied emergent care”.The federal government can revoke green cards and deport their holders for committing certain crimes, including drug trafficking and other serious felonies.Daniel Leising, a lawyer who represented Noviello in the 2023 racketeering case involving selling opioids – oxycodone, hydromorphine and hydrocodone – in Daytona Beach, said his client “was just working, nothing out of the ordinary, no violations, nothing else. There was nothing on my mind that would’ve created any circumstance where Johnny Noviello would have been a danger to anyone.”Leising told the outlet that Noviello’s family said he had epilepsy and was on seizure medication and they had worked “painstakingly to make sure that he got his meds”.Explore more on these topicsCanadaUS immigrationFloridaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The news sent US stock markets to fresh highs amid news of widerefforts to end the trade warsbetween the US and the world’s biggest economies.Donald Trump said on Thursday that the US had signed a deal withChinathe previous day, without providing additional details, and that there might be a separate deal coming up that would “open up” India.But the trade news was complicated on Friday afternoon when Trump announced he hadcalled offtalks with Canada over a digital sales tax. The S&P and the Nasdaq turned negative before recovering their losses.China confirmed the details of the deal on Friday, and reiterated that it will continue to approve the export permits of controlled items. The news sent US stock markets to new highs on Friday morning with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting record levels.DuringUS-China trade talks in Mayin Geneva, Beijing committed to removing non-tariff countermeasures imposed against the US since 2 April, although it was unclear how some of those measures would be walked back.The world wants China’s rare earth elements – what is life like in the city that produces them?Read moreAs part of its retaliation against new US tariffs, China suspended exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets,upending the supply chainscentral to automakers, aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors around the world.“The administration and China agreed to an additional understanding for a framework to implement the Geneva agreement,” a White House official said on Thursday.The understanding is “about how we can implement expediting rare-earth shipments to the US again”, the official said.A separate administration official said the US-China agreement took place earlier this week.Rare earth minerals chartChina has avirtual monopolyon the global supply of rare earths, having grown to dominate production and processing in the 1990s and the 2000s. Some of the rare earths mined in China are used in US military equipment, a vulnerability that has been laid bare in the US-China trade war.The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told Bloomberg: “They’re going to deliver rare earths to us” and once China did that, “we’ll take down our countermeasures”.The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on Friday that he hoped the US could reach trade agreements with more than a dozen nations by September – comments that suggest the White House has all but scrapped the 9 July deadline it had set to conclude negotiations before reimposing its more draconian “reciprocal tariffs”.“I think we could have trade wrapped up by Labor Day [1 September],” Bessent said on Fox Business Network. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Thursday that the 9 July deadline was “not critical”.While the agreement shows potential progress after months of trade uncertainty and disruption since Trump took office in January, it also underscores the long road ahead to a final, definitive trade deal between the two economic rivals.China has been taking its dual-use restrictions on rare earths “very seriously” and has been vetting buyers to ensure that materials are not diverted to US military uses, according to an industry source. This has slowed down the licensing process.The Wall Street Journal reported this week that China has told rare-earth companies to provide the government with a list of workers with technical expertise and has asked some to turn in their passports to prevent them from taking unauthorised overseas trips. China wants to ensure that its commercially valuable rare earths knowledge is not shared with foreign adversaries.Car manufacturers have already complained about factories being brought to a near halt because of supply chain shortages of rare earths and the magnets they are used in. A Ford executive said this week that the company was living “hand to mouth”.The Geneva deal had faltered over China’s curbs on critical minerals exports, prompting the Trump administration to respond with export controls of its own, preventing shipments of semiconductor design software, aircraft and other goods to China.In early June, Reuters reported that China had granted temporary export licences to rare-earth suppliers of the top three US automakers as supply chain disruptions began to surface from export curbs on those materials.Later in the month, Trump said there was a deal with China in which Beijing would supply magnets and rare-earth minerals while the US would allow Chinese students to study in its colleges and universities.Reuters contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsInternational tradeChinaGlobal economyAsia PacificUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

The six-person CMC is one of the most powerful institutions inChinaand is headed by Xi himself.On Friday, a statement from the Chinese government confirmed that Miao had been dismissed. He was suspended last year and placed under investigation for “serious violations of discipline”, a byword for corruption. He was expelled from the National People’s Congress, China’s parliament, in April.The dismissal makes Miao one of the highest-ranking CMC officials to be purged since the 1960s, and the latest in a rush of senior military figures targeted.He Weidong, a vice-chair of the CMC, is also reported to be under investigation.The CMC is the governing body of the PLA, and oversees China’s coastguard. Xi is the chair of the CMC, as well as being the leader of China’s ruling Communist party (CCP) and the president.Miao’s dismissal reflects the latest ructions in China’s armed forces. Beijing is keen to present an image of strength and stability on the world stage. The purges risk disrupting that image, although at a time when global attention is focused on wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, senior personnel changes in China’s military may garner less attention.US-China military dialogue, seen as essential for avoiding accidental conflicts, particularly in the Taiwan strait, have been limited under the presidency of Donald Trump, who has also fired several senior military officials. US military representatives travelled to Shanghai for talks in April, but there have been no public signs of high-ranking meetings.The US and Chinese defence ministers sometimes meet at theShangri-la Dialogue, an annual defence forum which was held in Singapore last month. But this year China only sent a small, lower-ranking delegation.In the past two years, Xi has dismissedtwo defence ministers, Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe; two heads of the PLA’s rocket force, which is responsible for missiles and the nuclear arsenal, and two senior CMC officials. Senior aerospace and defence business leaders have also beenremoved from a CCP advisory body.Many of the recent oustings appear to be related to an investigation into corruption in military procurement. Li, who was dismissed as defence minister in 2023 and expelled from the CCP last year, previously led the equipment procurement department. Several of his associates from the military and the equipment procurement department were also purged.Miao is the eighth member of the CMC to be ousted since Xi took power in 2012. The expulsion of CMC members was previously unheard of since the era of Mao Zedong.Xi took power with a promise to root out corruption in China, vowing to come after both the “tigers and the flies”. Since then, millions of officials have been investigated, and hundreds of thousands reportedly penalised, including high-profile people being expelled or prosecuted.Having now ruled for more than a decade, however, many of the senior figures coming into the crosshairs of anti-corruption campaigns are people, such as Miao and Li, who Xi had personally appointed, raising questions about his ability to vet important appointments.One of the most high-profile of Xi’s picks to fall was the formerforeign minister Qin Gang. Qin disappeared from public view in June 2023, drawing global attention as one of China’s most public-facing officials. Speculation that he was under investigation ran rampant until October whenBeijing announced he had been removedfrom his post. No reason was given.Explore more on these topicsChinaXi JinpingAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He was hanged on Friday.After freeing a man who spent half a century on death row, will Japan keep using the death penalty?Read moreShiraishi is said to have lured his mostly female victims, aged between 15 and 26, to his apartment near Tokyo, where he killed them and cut up their bodies.Headmitted murdering all nine, having made contact with suicidal victims on Twitter and offering to help them die, before stashing bits of bodies in coolers around his small apartment, according to media reports.Justice minister Keisuke Suzuki said Shiraishi’s crimes included “robbery, rape, murder ... destruction of a corpse and abandonment of a corpse”.“Nine victims were beaten and strangled, killed, robbed, and then mutilated with parts of their bodies concealed in boxes, and parts discarded in a garbage dump,” Suzuki told reporters in Tokyo on Friday.“After much careful consideration, I ordered the execution,” he said.Japan and the United States are the only two members of the Group of Seven industrialised economies to retain the death penalty.There is overwhelming public support for the practice, and a 2024 Japanese government survey of 1,800 respondents showed 83%saw the death penalty as “unavoidable”.In 2022, Tomohiro Kato washanged for an attack in 2008in which he rammed a rented two-tonne truck into a crowd in Tokyo’s Akihabara district, before getting out and going on a stabbing spree, in an attack that killed seven people.As of December 2023, 107 prisoners were waiting for their death sentences to be carried out, the Justice Ministry told the AFP news agency. It is always done by hanging.The law stipulates that executions must be carried out within six months of a final verdict after appeals are exhausted.In reality, however, most inmates are left on tenterhooks in solitary confinement for years – and sometimes decades – causing severe consequences for their mental health.There is widespread criticism of the system and the government’s lack of transparency over the practice. Inmates are often informed of their impending death at the last minute, typically in the early morning before it happens.The high-profile executions of theShoko Asaharaand 12 former members of the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult took place in 2018.

They also have more than two-and-a-half times the disposable income.Ben Phillips, an associate professor from the ANU’s Centre for Social Policy Research, said the analysis undermined claims thatmany individuals would struggleto find the cash to pay for the proposed 15% earnings tax on balances over $3m, which is applied to notional gains rather than realised profits.Phillips said he had done the research to inform what he calledthe “unprecedented” public debateof a relatively minor policy change that affected a very small proportion of wealthy Australians.Super tax debate highlights everything wrong with Australia’s media and economic system | Greg JerichoRead more“These arevery wealthy peoplewith a lot of other assets, and also with a lot of income. It would be very, very surprising if all but a small handful of people would struggle to pay this tax,” he said.In particular, Phillips and his colleague Richard Webster, a senior research officer, wanted to test claims that taxing unrealised gains could force some to sell big assets – most notably farms – to pay the impost.With the farming lobby group mounting a campaign against the super tax, the research estimated about 2,400 people with large super balances are farmers.The farming lobby has claimed that cash-strapped but asset-rich farmers could be forced to sell farm land to raise money to pay the tax, which is calculated on the annual notional change in the value of their super balances.The modelling of ABS survey data showed that only 0.6% of the estimated 87,000 individuals with large balances, or 500 people, could struggle to find the cash to pay for the extra earnings tax.Super chart“They are sort of ‘unicorn’ cases, and even then we don’t know what’s in their super accounts,” Phillips said, which he reckoned were likely to include enough liquid assets to pay the tax.“That’s not to say it’s necessarily a good tax, but we are not seeing any barriers to these people paying a bit of extra tax on their super.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe paper models a scenario where an individual with $4m in super records a 10% gain, which – assuming for simplicity no contributions or withdrawals – incurs an extra tax of about $19,000.If that extra tax is more than 10% of the household’s disposable income and other wealth (that is, wealth not in super or in the home), then that household fails the stress test.Leading tax expert calls out ‘confected outrage’ of wealthy Australians over Labor’s $3m super planRead moreIn this case, the household could struggle to pay the tax if they are also unable to easily pay the tax from their super savings.The modelling suggests the median high super balance household has annual disposable income of nearly $250,000, versus $95,000 for all households, and nearly eight in 10 own their own home outright.Two-thirds of the estimated 87,000 people with high super balances are men, three in four live in a capital city, and over half don’t work.“We really need to question why people have so much money in super for a start, when you only need enough to give you a comfortable retirement,” Phillips said.“You also have to question – given the nature of super, where it’s about getting money when you need it – why would you have large amounts of illiquid assets[assets not easily converted to cash]? That’s not really what super is about. That seems to be more about a tax haven, rather than a saving vehicle for your retirement”Explore more on these topicsSuperannuationLabor partyAustralian politicsTaxAustralian economyAnthony AlbanesenewsShareReuse this content"

When people see Bunnings and Officeworks doing this, it adds a ripple effect where other large companies can be influenced by seeing what these companies are doing, and seeing their car parks with EV chargers.”He said large industrial roof spaces had not been as well utilised with solar panels as households, sometimes because either structurally the roofs were not strong enough, or agreements were complicated between tenants and building owners.He said: “This is a great opportunity where we have the owner and operator – Wesfarmers – that we can work with.”The CEFC, with access to $32bn of government money, is a green bank that provides financing and loans to accelerate decarbonisation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The UK, Iceland and New Zealand voiced their support earlier in the conference.As Australia campaigns for Cop31 hosting rights, it’s time to stop talking and start doing | Bill HareRead moreNo countries in the group of 29 nations that will decide the 2026 venue – known as Western Europe and Other States – have publicly backed Turkey’s bid. But under the UN’s consensus decision-making process the issue cannot be resolved while the Turkish government, led by presidentRecep Tayyip Erdoğan, remains in the race.The delayed decision has potential ramifications for the organisation of an event that would be one of the largest events hosted in Australia. For two sleepless weeks in November, it would draw tens of thousands of people from nearly 200 countries – and the world’s attention – to the host city. It is a major political and logistical exercise.The annual Cops – short for Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change – are the major event on the climate diplomacy calendar. If the Adelaide bid is successful, the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has said the focus of the negotiations between government officials should be on implementation: how to turn new national pledges for 2035 that are due to be submitted this year into concrete, rapid – and belated – global action.The diplomatic negotiations would run alongside a massive trade fair for green industries. Out on the streets, activists would call for Australia and other fossil fuel nations to do much, much more to back up their climate rhetoric.There had been expectations since before last year’s Cop29 summit in Baku, Azerbaijan,that Turkey would eventually bow to the inevitable and withdraw. But there was no sign in Bonn of that eventuality.Instead,Turkeylaunched a renewed pitch to win the rights, holding a reception to lobby delegates with a presentation on why Cop31 should be held in the southern resort city of Antalya. It argued that, compared with its rival, it was geographically central – and not a major coal and gas exporter.Observers at the talks said countries did not appear to be swayed. Turkey’s case has weakened since Baku after Erdoğan’s main political rival was arrested in March, prompting widespread anti-government protests and clashes with police. And itsrecord on climate action is not strong.Its resistance to pressure to exit the race means countries missed a deadline set in Azerbaijan that a decision should be made no later than the Bonn mid-year meeting so that the successful host had time to prepare.It has widely been assumed Turkey would be open to dropping out if the terms were right. It has argued that it should be removed from the list of “annex 1” developed countries that since the 1990s have been expected to act first in combating the climate emergency. But there has been little appetite from other countries to allow this change.The Bonn meeting agreed the stand-off needs to be resolved as soon as possible. At the latest, it will have to happen by the Cop30 conference in Belém, a Brazilian city on the Amazon River, in November. The new host will then assume the Cop presidency, a global leadership role that lasts through the year.Observers in Australia are increasingly calling on the government to step up its campaign to get the issue resolved. The chief executive of the SmartEnergyCouncil, John Grimes, is among those urging Anthony Albanese to get more involved. Albanese has not attended a Cop since becoming PM.“It is time for the government to flick the switch if we are to get this done,” Grimes says. That requires a whole-of-government effort led by the prime minister, for whom the Cop will be a legacy defining opportunity, particularly in the eyes of his Pacific counterparts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is too important, the diplomacy too intricate, and the timeline now too tight, for there to be anything less than a full-throated Australian diplomatic effort to secure the bid by the time the prime minister goes to the United Nations (general assembly in New York) in September.”While relatively little discussed in political debate, Labor has been declaring its hope of hosting a “Pacific Cop” since late 2021, before it was elected the following year.It has faced accusations of hypocrisy and alleged greenwashing for arguing it should lead a major climate event while it continues to back fossil fuel expansions and extensions, including a recent decision to allowWoodside Energy’s North West Shelf gas plantto run until 2070.But leaders from the Pacific, green industries and climate groups have largely expressed a hope thatCop31would spur government and business to accelerate action at home and abroad.Supporters include Palau’s president Surangel Whipps Jr, whotold the Guardiana successful bid would be a sign Australia was investing in its “Pacific brothers and sisters” and “ensuring that we have a healthy planet”.The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas,has become an enthusiastic advocate, including commissioning an analysis that suggested it could attract 30,000 people and could be worth $500m to the state – more than the combined benefit of all its existing major events.Bowen makes similar arguments. Speaking at an energy conference in Melbourne last week, he said the government was “actively campaigning” for the conference to “attract global investment”, “supercharge our transformation into a renewable energy superpower” and “put the Pacific front and centre on the world stage”.He said it had been “working hard” with its international partners and Turkey to resolve the bid.On the latest evidence, it may have to step it up a bit.Explore more on these topicsCop31Climate crisisEnergyTurkeyAustralian politicsAdelaidePacific islandsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Latour is upset that Etihad are insisting on charging her $3,500 to change their tickets if they want to postpone their trip until early next year.“I kept repeating over the phone: ‘We’re genuinely scared, we’re not making this up.’ [But] not a care in the world,” Latour said. “They’re just like, ‘well, pay the [fee]’.”Australian travellers had already been advised to avoid the region as Israel and Iran exchanged missile strikes , before a US strike prompted the Iranian retaliation.Airlines are changing plans due to the Middle East conflict. How will it affect Australian passengers?Read moreCountries closed their airspaces and airlines diverted flights, leaving passengers stranded. Iran has threatened to strike US military bases if it is subjected to further American attacks.But Australians hoping to avoid flying through the Middle East in coming weeks have found they havelimited consumer rightsto move or cancel their own flights.With many passengers facingdelays, scheduling changes and cancellations,consumer advocates have called for stronger protections to ensure compensation and transparency for passengers.View image in fullscreenSharon Latour says her request for a free or low-fee deferral was refused by Etihad.Photograph: Sharon LatourLatour left Australia for a work trip to Malaysia, and her husband joined her in early June. They planned to holiday in Europe, so while in Kuala Lumpur they booked Etihad flights to Rome with a transit in Abu Dhabi.They booked business class seats on Etihad using a combination of rewards points and a bank card.Latour said she and her husband were looking forward to their trip until the airspace closures caused by Iran’s threats to strike US bases. They were worried about Al Dhafra airbase, which hosts US military assets and is situated just 25km from Abu Dhabi.At this point Latour said she contacted Etihad to request help moving their flight, “because we’re really scared, we don’t want to be stuck there”.“You just had bombardment, missiles flying literally next door,” she said. “You have an American basereally close to the airport. We don’t want to go there.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailLatour said an Etihad call centre representative told her she should have been aware of the company’s rules requiring the payment of rescheduling fees. They refused Latour’s request for a free or low-fee deferral to fly instead on March 2026.Australians travelling through Middle Eastern airports in June have reported chaotic waits.Guardian readers have reported being among thousands stranded in Doha airport. One couple reported being stuck at Doha airport for 40 hours.They said the airport had few staff assisting passengers.Another passenger told Guardian Australia that Doha airport security staff threatened to seize the mobile phones of some customers who had attempted to film the queues and crowds. Passengers joined airport staff behind information desks as customers waited for flight information, they claimed.View image in fullscreenPeople stuck at Doha airport last week amid flight delays and cancellations.Photograph: SuppliedBut Australian consumers are unlikely to have any legal rights to defer their flights unless their airline’s fine print allows, experts say.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) have said airlines must meet the guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law. But the guarantees may not apply in every case.The consumer guarantees probably won’t apply if an airline delays or cancels a flight due to the actions of a third party, such as a government implementing restrictions on the flight, the ACCC said.And if a customer initiates a cancellation, the guarantees are again unlikely to apply, meaning any remedy consumers are entitled to will depend on the specific terms and conditions of their fare.In Latour’s case, she and her husband are likely at the “behest” of Etihad, especially because they booked their tickets in Malaysia and not Australia, according to Jodi Bird, a travel expert at the consumer advocacy organisation Choice.Bird said if they had booked the tickets at home they could have at least mounted an argument that they should be protected under consumer law.But even that outcome is doubtful, Bird said. “Our experience is that it doesn’t do a lot to protect you beyond [the terms and conditions] of the airline.”Bird said even people whose flights were cancelled or rescheduled by the airlines will likely be reliant on the carriers for compensation. And they could struggle to get refunds rather than flight credits, he said.The predicament raises broader questions around consumer protections in the aviation industry, Bird said.Choice has called for the federal government to implement a compensation system for passengers affected by cancelled and delayed flights, which Bird said would be similar to a scheme in the European Union.“The main advantage is it just becomes more transparent,” he said. “You’ve got that kind of central place that people can go to to understand the rules, rather than having to understand the fine print of every single different airline.”The Albanese government has committed to having an aviation industry ombudsman operating in 2026.Selling a house in Australia is expensive. The ACCC is investigating one reason whyRead more“Etihad flights are operating normally and to schedule,” the airline said on Friday night. “The airline only operates through approved airspace and we would never operate a flight unless it was safe to do so.”Etihad’s terms and conditions indicate that customers are entitled to re-book or get a refund if the airline cancels their flight, or if they booked a fare which offered free re-booking.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Here are seven takeaways.1.Foam partyThe couple kicked off celebrations with a foam party on their $500m (£364m) super yacht moored near the Croatian island of Unije. Coinciding with Sánchez’s son Evan Whitesell’s 19th birthday, paparazzi photos showed the couple wearing swimwear and sunhats covered in frothy suds as they partied alongside Whitesell and his friends. Foam parties can cause conjunctivitis, so the decision to hold one just days before their nuptials was somewhat surprising but maybe billionaire foam hits different.View image in fullscreenJeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez get on a taxi boat at the Aman hotel.Photograph: Stefano Rellandini/AFP/Getty Images2.The invitationWhat do you get for the fourth richest person in the world? Apparently nothing. A portion of the official invitation obtained by ABC News stipulated an early request from the couple; “please, no gifts”. Instead it stated that Bezos and Sánchez would be making donations “with gratitude” on their guests’ behalf to causes including the Venice International University and an organisation dedicated to restoring the city’s lagoons. On social media, the biggest question users had was: who had designed the invite? Featuring doodle-like illustrations of butterflies, shooting stars, feathers and the Rialto Bridge, some argued the invitations had been generated by AI or, perhaps, bulk bought via Amazon.View image in fullscreenA woman dressed as a bride walks near the Rialto Bridge on second day of the wedding festivities of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sánchez in Venice.Photograph: Yara Nardi/Reuters3.The goodie bagAlongside donations on their behalf, each guest will receive a goodie bag. We are still waiting for one of the Kardashian clan to do an official unboxing on YouTube but so far it has been revealed that they feature sweet treats from the historic Venetian pastry shop Rosa Salva and vibrant coloured glassware from the Murano specialist Laguna~B.View image in fullscreenJeff BezosPhotograph: Daniel Dal Zennaro/EPA4.The thunderstormsFirst came the anti-capitalist public protests. Then it turned out one of Bezos and Sánchez’s three chosen venues was covered by unsightly scaffolding. The next disaster to hit? A freak thunderstorm on Thursday night during a welcoming party at the Madonna dell’Orto cloisters. Heavy lightning and rain reportedly left many guests soaked, forcing the event to end early. Perhaps Bezos and Sánchez should have followed fashion week’s lead and hired a rain shaman.View image in fullscreenKylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner on their way to the Madonna dell’Orto for the welcoming party.Photograph: Piovanotto Marco/ABACA/Shutterstock5.The fashionThe biggest hint that Sánchez will at some point wear a dress by Dolce & Gabbana stems from a photo of Domenico Dolce enjoying aperitivo hour at the Gritti Palace, a five-star hotel on Venice’s Grand canal. Sánchez is a long-time fan of the Italian label but, saying that, she isn’t particularly loyal to any brand, and it’s thought that Anna Wintour – who is likely attending – is supportive of the idea. As she recently told Vogue after decades of dressing in tailoring during her TV presenting days, she is now focusing on “having fun” with fashion. Plus, she has the budget to buy whatever she wants rather than rely on designers to approve her wearing a loan.Sánchez appeared to whizz off to the ceremony in an Audrey Hepburn cosplay in a headscarf and dark glasses.View image in fullscreenLauren Sánchez in Venice.Photograph: Yara Nardi/Reuters6.The Dolce Vita vintage cosplayGetting lost in Venice is part of the charm. Not so if you have a staged paparazzi shot to get to. As anyone who’s been in a city tour group will know, ensuring all parties are dressed in the same garb is the easiest way to stay with the party. Literal dressing, where you pay homage to the place, is one thing. The fetishisation of postwar Italian cultural icons such as Monica Vitti or Sophia Loren in some archive Cavalli (Kendall and Kylie) or vintage Versace snakeskin (Kim) is another. Still, it’s probably the simplest way to stay with the crowd while reminding people you’re in Italy. In case anyone had forgotten.View image in fullscreenKim Kardashian during the wedding celebrations.Photograph: Errebi/Shutterstock7.Killing timeWith the ceremony not taking place until Friday evening, many guests found themselves with time to kill. With a personal art collection valued at $127mn, it came as no surprise that Bill Gates and a friend popped into the Gallerie dell'Accademia that houses the Pietà by Titian.View image in fullscreenBill Gates on the second day of the wedding festivities.Photograph: Manuel Silvestri/ReutersExplore more on these topicsJeff BezosVeniceItalyEuropeAmazonWeddingsnewsShareReuse this content"

Byron on the prowl. Rising water levels. Cruise ships the size of city blocks.Venicemay have endured many tumultuous events and sinister challenges over the centuries but rarely in its long history has it had to contend with an issue quite as odd and quite as divisive as the sort-of nuptials of the world’s fourth-richest person.Friday morning found the lagoon city doing what it does best: looking gorgeous and slightly unreal as it played host to thousands of tourists who posed in silver-prowed gondolas, chugged mid-morning spritzes or simply wilted in the muggy heat.But across the water from St Mark’s Square,Jeff Bezosand Lauren Sánchez’s big day was getting under way. The precise choreography of events may not have been clear, but an elaborately planned and stealthily executed operation was unfolding on the tiny island of San Giorgio Maggiore, where the couple would later pledge eternal love and fidelity before a crowd of 200 mainly famous guests.View image in fullscreenJeff Bezos leaving the Aman hotel on Friday afternoon.Photograph: Yara Nardi/ReutersA handful of camera crews mooched around the entrance to the Giorgio Cini foundation, where a pair of tight-lipped but polite individuals sat before monitors under a gazebo and politely fended off requests for information.And no, they really didn’t know when the ceremony would begin. According to reports, the couple had already tied the knot in the US, making Friday’s event as symbolic as it was expensive.The long Venetian afternoon stirred from its torpor at 5pm when Sánchez emerged from the Aman hotel, wearing a cream suit, sunglasses and a headscarf. The bride then boarded a water taxi that ferried her past the legions of photographers and over to the island. The groom, dressed in black tie, followed an hour later.Bezos wedding annotated satellite imageDespite the heavy media presence and the epic scale of the festivities, however, not everyone on San Giorgio Maggiore was fizzing with excitement.Hosing down the deck of his boat in the island’s harbour, 100 metres away from the venue, one local man had offered a laconic and not untypical take on what has become known, a little tediously, as “the wedding of the century”.What did he make of all the fuss? “I’m not thinking about it at all,” he said. “I don’t care.”View image in fullscreenSánchez waves from a boat on her way to San Giorgio Maggiore.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APThe wedding celebrations – which began in earnest on Thursday night and are due to culminate in a reception held at the Arsenale historic shipyard complex on Saturday – have split the city into three groups. There are those, such as the yachtsman, who simply don’t care; there are those furious that Venice is prostrating itself before a man with an estimated net worth of $212bn (£154bn), and then those who, like the city’s mayor, see the £40m extravaganza as a welcome money-spinner and a wonderful showcase for the area’s attractions.Bezos and Sánchez’s famous friends do not appear to have been put off by the controversy, and there have been imaginative protests over the past few days – including rumours of a reserve armada ofcanal-blocking inflatable crocodiles.View image in fullscreenOprah Winfrey and Orlando Bloom leave the Gritti Palace hotel, on the second day of the wedding festivities of Bezos and Sánchez.Photograph: Manuel Silvestri/ReutersThursday night’s welcome party in the cloisters of the Madonna dell’Orto, a 14th-century church in the Cannaregio area, was attended by celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady and Orlando Bloom.But it was followed by yet another resourceful display of disapproval. A little before 11pm, a green laser was used to spell out the slogan, “No Kings, No Bezos”, on the belltower in St Mark’s Square. Similar guerrilla actions over recent days have included the unfurling of a banner reading: “If you can rent Venice for your wedding you can pay more tax.”Those behind the protests – a coalition of groups angered by the selling-out of the city, housing activists and anti-cruise ship campaigners – say their punning“No Space for Bezos”alliance has already paid off. They claim their sustained pressure, not least the threat to deploy the blow-up crocodile fleet, had prompted the couple to switch the location of the reception from the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, a majestic 16th-century building in the city centre, to the more private Arsenale.Others have a different take on the superyachts and the 90 private jets that have descended on Venice this week. The city’s mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, has dismissed the protesters as “shameful” and said the Bezos-Sánchez union will fill Venetian coffers.View image in fullscreenThe ‘No Kings No Bezos’ protest sign in St Mark’s Square.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APThat view is shared by Italy’s tourism minister, Daniela Santanchè. “There will be photos everywhere, social media will go wild over the bride’s dress, over the ceremony,” she told Associated Press.“All of this translates into a massive free publicity campaign. In fact, because they will spend a lot of money, they will enrich Venice – our shopkeepers, artisans, restaurateurs, hotels. So it’s a great opportunity both for spending and for promoting Italy in the world.”View image in fullscreenThe Bezos lookalike Cagdas Halicilar.Photograph: Sam Jones/The GuardianOne man, however, had his very own reasons for wishing the Amazon founder all the best.Cagdas Halicilar, a 47-year-old German who runs a delivery truck company, has a sideline as a pretty convincing Bezos lookalike.He had travelled to Venice to greet and confound the crowds and was also hoping for a quick encounter with Bezos so that he could give him the €3,000 (£2,600) bottle of whiskey he had bought him as a wedding present.“I realised the resemblance three years ago,” he said. “My life has changed a lot since then. Wherever I go, people are like, ‘Jeff! Jeff!’”He had come tantalisingly close to his doppelganger on Thursday night when a beautiful burgundy boat cruised past him. “He saw me and I waved and he gave me a thumbs-up,” said Halicilar. “I was so happy. I cried.”If the German delivery boss does finally get to meet Bezos, he has a simple message. “I will just tell him that I’m proud to look like him. That’s all. He’s not arrogant and he has a big heart. He makes people smile and I’m a huge fan.”(He also hopes that if Bezos is reading this piece, his people can arrange a meeting to hand over the whiskey.)View image in fullscreenLeonardo DiCaprio keeping a low profile while boarding a boat.Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersAs the day wore on, the secret preparations continued and the vicious June sun beat down on tourists, guests and journalists, one visitor making her way around San Giorgio Maggiore shook her head. This was all proof, if further proof were needed, of the awesome power of the 21st-century super-rich.“It’s grotesque,” said the woman, who was from northern Spain. “Two hundred and fifty guests and a bill of €50m? This is why I don’t buy anything on Amazon.”Explore more on these topicsJeff BezosVeniceItalyThe super-richEuropeWeddingsnewsShareReuse this content"

And rather than Paris, where Jonathan Anderson made his Dior debut on Friday, the most powerful person in fashion was in Venice forthe Bezos/Sánchez wedding, shortly afterrelinquishing her roleas editor-in-chief at American Vogue.Unlike the wedding of the year, Anderson’s show proved to be sweet relief for anyone wanting to flex a cooler, chicer muscle. Perched on wooden cubes within the Cour du Dôme des Invalides sat plenty of VIP clout: Daniel Craig, Donatella Versace and Roger Federer. Most of the Arnault family, who ownDiorand routinely joust with Jeff Bezos over who has more money, were present. Even Rihanna, pregnant in a Dior pastel waistcoat, was relatively punctual.View image in fullscreenA$AP Rocky and Rihanna attend the Dior Homme spring/summer 2026 collection in Paris.Photograph: Christophe Ena/APAnderson is known for his sharp eye and crafty, mercurial taste – few people have shaped the red carpet and ultimately the high street into the hype machine it is today. But Dior is a different challenge. As the first creative director of menswear and womenswear since Christian Dior himself, the designer needs to revamp LVMH’s second biggest brand, with estimated revenues far greater than at his former label, Loewe.“I can’t stand here and say I’m not nervous, that it is not petrifying,” he said backstage before the show, wearing his trademark Levi’s and a plaid Dior shirt. “Dior is on billboards. It’s on Rihanna. It’s transcendent. But this is the starting point – I’ve been here four months, and the first five shows will show different aspects. Some will contradict; others will be completely radical.”Some designers get critical acclaim, others sell a lot of clothes – a rare few have a talent to do both, but that’s the hope with Anderson. Because of tariff wars and a decline in the luxury market, LVMH shares have halved from their 2023 peak. “Delphine [Arnault] and I, we talked about changing the quality, about upping the game,” Anderson said.Opening the show was a bar jacket in Donegal tweed. More interested in how a look is put together than the clothes themselves, Anderson styled it with a pair of thick cream cargo shorts cut from 15 metres of fabric and layered up like a Viennetta. Knitted vests were a through line, as were ties and neck ruffles, and plenty of colour – greens, pinks and blues. Dior, he says, is a house of colour, in part because it offsets the “house grey” that features on billboards, Dior clothes labels he redesigned and the Parisian sky.View image in fullscreenThere was plenty of colour in the menswear show – including pink and green – and a preppy, eccentric look.Photograph: Christophe Ena/APA puffer gilet was circularly cut and placed over a formal shirt, while summer coats and capes came knitted or in pleated bright colours. One was even based on an original Dior shape “that would have cost the equivalent of a Ferrari”, except here it was styled with trainers. There were even jeans – skinny and baggy, in indigo and green. The look was preppy and eccentric, with shades of Loewe, JW Anderson, and even Uniqlo in the puffers, among the classic Dior shapes.On Anderson’s original moodboard were Warholian images of the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and the socialite Lee Radziwill, alongside classic Dior dresses such as the Delft and Cigale. The idea was to take each look into the present, “to recontextualise it”, he said. He even took his predecessor Maria Grazia Chiuri’s book bag totes and put a “new skin” on them, in the form of Dracula and Les Liaisons Dangereuses. It’s these hyperspecific references that give Anderson’s work a pleasing temporality, and will no doubt sell well – here at Dior, and whatever high street shop will no doubt copy him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It seems to have worked.After Trump landed to Washington from this week’s Nato summit in The Hague, the White Houseposted a videothat made clear how his team felt the trip had gone.The summit had concluded on Wednesday with a joint press conference in which Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, after showering the US president with compliments over his actions on Iran, bizarrelyreferred to him as “daddy”.Rutte was now being widely derided for the summit’s“orchestrated grovel”andattempting to row backon his choice of language. In Washington, however, Team Trump were enjoying themselves.“Daddy’s home!” trilled the video, which mixed clips of Trump’s handshakes with world leaders with footage of crowds awaiting his motorcade, soundtracked by a 2010 song by Usher: “And I know you’ve been waiting for this loving all day …”The tone of Rutte’s public bootlicking had been muted compared withthe text messageshe had sent to “dear Donald” before the summit – “Congratulations and thank you for your decisive action in Iran, it was truly extraordinary … you will achieve something NO president in decades could get done” – and which the president had immediately leaked. “I think he likes me,”smirked Trump later, while his cabinet giggled behind him.Ass-kissing, arse-licking, brown-nosing, sucking up – there is a reason metaphors for obsequiousness so often involve body fluids and the backside, because the act of sycophancy demeans both the arselicker and the arselickee.What is more cringeworthy, after all – the clips of Trump’s cabinet members taking turns to parrot praise of his leadership and vision, or the fact thathis fragile egodemands lavish compliments before he can get down to work?No doubtall the president’s yes-menbelieve that lavishing him with praise can lead to lavish rewards.Take the former South Dakota governor Kristi Noem, who in 2020presentedhim with a “bookshelf-sized” bronze model of Mount Rushmore, portraying Trump’s face next to those of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt. Noem isnow the secretary of homeland security. Stephen Miller,who called Trump“the most stylish president in our lifetime”, is the White House deputy chief of staff for policy.To some observers, this is just how Trump works, at home and abroad, and world leaders like Rutte who engage in flattery and “strategic self-emasculation” are just being smart. “A useful way to think about President Trump and his team is not in terms of a conventional American administration, but rather as a court,” saysSam Edwards, a reader in modern political history at Loughborough University. Understood in those terms, he argues, performative upsucking is all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I guess that’s the strategic calculation that Rutte has made. I might come in for criticism, but further down the line, do I get what I want? Yes.”That view is not universal, however. “Mr Rutte, he’s trying to embarrass you, sir,” Trump’s former director of communications Anthony Scaramuccisaid earlier this week. “He’s literally sitting on Air Force One laughing at you.”David H Dunn, a professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham, agrees that licking Trump’s boots doesn’t earn his favour but his disdain. His flattering cabinet were selected not because the president admires them, says Dunn, but because their obsequiousness shows their weakness.He thinks Rutte, too, has miscalculated. “There is a lot of evidence from the first term that Trump doesn’t necessarily respond to flattery,” Dunn says. “It sends a signal that this is not an alliance of equals. This is not the America of old, whereby there was a coming together of countries of shared values and shared interests. What it looks like is fealty to the king.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpMark RutteTrump administrationNatoEuropeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The soldiers said they had concerns about using unnecessary lethal force against people who appeared to pose no threat.Haaretz also quoted unnamed sources as saying that the army unit established to review incidents that may involve breaches of international law had been tasked with examining soldiers’ actions near distribution locations over the past month.In a statement reported by Israeli media,the IDF rejected the accusations, saying that no forces had been ordered “to deliberately shoot at civilians, including those approaching the distribution centers”.“To be clear, IDF directives prohibit deliberate attacks on civilians,” the IDF said.In a joint statement issued late on Friday, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and Israel Katz, the defence minister, accused Haaretz of “malicious falsehoods designed to defame the IDF, the most moral military in the world”.View image in fullscreenPalestinians carry humanitarian aid packages near the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation distribution centre on Thursday.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APFood has become extremely scarce in Gaza since a tight blockade on all supplies was imposed by Israel throughout March and April,threatening many of the 2.3 million peoplewho live there with famine.Since the blockade was partly lifted last month, the UN has tried to bring in aid but has faced major obstacles, including rubble-choked roads, Israeli military restrictions, continuing airstrikes and growing anarchy. Hundreds of trucks have been looted by armed gangs and by crowds of desperate Palestinians.On Thursday, 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike targeting Palestinian police distributing flour in a market in the centralGazacity of Deir al-Balah, medical officials said.The strike appears to have targeted members of a security force set up by the Hamas-led interior ministry to target looters and merchants who sell stolen aid at high prices.The unit, known asSahm, or Arrow, confiscates stolen aid which it then distributes. Witnesses said many of the casualties were ordinary civilians who had gathered to receive sacks of flour from a warehouse near the Baraka crossroads in the northern part of Deir al-Balah.The dead included a child and at least seven Sahm members, according to the nearby al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital, where casualties were taken. There was no immediate comment on the attack from the Israeli military.Razeq Abu Mandil, a paramedic from the al-Maghazi refugee camp, said: “Among the injured were men, women, and children. In my ambulance, there was a woman and her daughter – both wounded.“When we arrived, there were people torn to pieces – severely wounded and dead … We started transporting the injured and the dead to the hospital, then returned again to load the ambulances.

I looked around and saw people lying on the ground – torn bodies, wounded individuals, blood and its smell filling the air, cries and screams,” he said.The strike came shortly after Israel closed crossings into northernGaza, cutting the most direct route for aid to the parts of the territory where the humanitarian crisis is most acute.View image in fullscreenA mourner during the funeral of Palestinians who, according to the Gaza health ministry, were killed in the strike in Deir al-Balah on Thursday.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersFor most of the war, aid in Gaza was distributed mainly by the UN and other international humanitarian organisations, but Israel said Hamas diverted and sold supplies to finance its military and other operations.The UN and other aid groups deny the charge and say their monitoring of their distribution networks is robust.Israel has backed an American private contractor, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which started distributing food boxes in Gaza last month from four hubs.To reach the GHF sites, which open intermittently and unpredictably and often at night, Palestinians must cross rubble-strewn roads and Israeli military zones where witnesses say troops oftenfire on themwith mortars, tanks and machine guns.A senior aid official in Gaza said many of the shootings occurred in darkness when civilians gathered near Israeli troops to wait for distribution sites to open or to receive aid looted from trucks.“The soldiers fire to keep them away, or because they don’t know who is there, or because they don’t care, or all three,” the official said.Medical records from independent NGOs working in Gaza, seen by the Guardian, confirm hundreds of lethal injuries from bullets and some from shelling.The IDF insists its internal processesare robustbutcriticssay few investigations are thoroughly pursued and only a tiny fraction result in any sanction.Israel has continued to allow a smaller number of aid trucks into Gaza for distribution by the UN and other organisations, with about 70 entering the territory each day on Monday and Tuesday. On Thursday, Israel shut entry points used to access directly the north of the territory, where the need for aid is greatest.António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said on Friday that the US-backed aid operation in Gaza is “inherently unsafe”, giving a blunt assessment: “It is killing people.”“People are being killed simply trying to feed themselves and their families. The search for food must never be a death sentence,” Guterres told reporters.The war was triggered by a Hamas attack on southern Israel in which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage.The overall death toll in Gaza in the 20-month conflicthas reached 56,331fatalities, mostly civilians, according to local health authorities.Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGazaWar crimesIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She is on a glucose drip in St Thomas’ hospital in London. The 69-year-old’s decision came after discussions with doctors and her family. She has been on hunger strike for more than 270 days to secure improvement inAbd el-Fattah’s jail conditionsor his release.The UK foreign secretary,David Lammy, told MPs this week he was confident that the UK strategy to secure Abd el-Fattah’s release was working, but did not give any further details to explain that view.In a readout of the Starmer phone call with Sisi, Downing Street said: “Turning to the bilateral relationship between the UK andEgypt, the leaders underscored the potential to go further and faster on trade and investment to benefit both countries. The prime minister also raised the case of British national Alaa Abd el-Fattah and again pressed for his release so that he can be reunited with his family.”The fact that the British readout seemed to link improved trade ties to Abd el-Fattah’s release hinted at an effort to persuade Sisi that it would be in Egypt’s economic interest to permit the release of the British-Egyptian dual national.It is the third phone call the UK prime minister has made to the Egyptian president in which he has raised the award-winning writer’s imprisonment.In the Egyptian version of the call, “the two leaders emphasised the two countries’ keenness on enhancing their bilateral relations across various fields, particularly in the economic and investment spheres”.Starmer said he looked forward to Sisi’s acceptance of the invitation, extended from the king, to visit London. For his part, Sisi confirmed the invitation extended to the British prime minister to visit Egypt later this year.The two leaders also discussed a Gaza ceasefire. No mention of Abd el-Fattah was made in the Egyptian statement.View image in fullscreenLaila Soueif, the mother of Alaa Abd el-Fattah (photographed here in November 2024), is now in a critical condition in hospital after more than 270 days on hunger strike.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianSome MPs have been calling for the Foreign Office to change its travel advice in a bid to threaten the Egyptian economy with the loss of UK tourist income, but there has been tension inside the Foreign Office over whether threats or incentives will persuade Egypt’s authoritarian leader that continued detention is damaging the Egyptian national interest.Laila Soueif, on 247th day of hunger strike for jailed British-Egyptian son, defiant in face of deathRead moreSoueif, a university professor and long-term campaigner for human rights in Egypt, has beenin and out of hospitalsince she started her hunger strike, but her health has become critical over the past three weeks as her blood glucose levels dropped.Her daughter Sanaa Seif, posting on Facebook on Wednesday, said her mother might be facing long-term mobility issues, and had fallen twice the day before. Seif wrote: “She was not sure she knows how to stand on her legs again and at her age it is hard to build muscle … The signs of course were very scary and mama was forced to use the wheelchair again.”Soueif has again agreed to a small glucose intake to improve her blood sugar levels. She continues to take no food.The Labour MP Stella Creasy asked Lammy on Tuesday to give an assurance all options were being considered, including changing the travel advice to Egypt.The foreign secretary replied: “This case and Laila’s condition has concerned me greatly. It has been a top priority every week I have been in office: at every single level – prime minister, foreign secretary, foreign minister and national security adviser – we are engaged with the Egyptians. I believe our strategy is working, but given Laila’s health we must see progress at pace with the Egyptians.”Abd el-Fattah was arrested in September 2019, after he had already served five years for the so-called Shura council protest in November 2013 when dozens of activists were detained for demonstrating against military trials. In December 2021, after more than two years in detention, he was sentenced again – this time to five more years, accused of spreading false news for reposting a tweet about a detainee who died as a result of his torture in prison.Explore more on these topicsEgyptKeir StarmerDavid LammyMiddle East and north AfricaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

While much of the world’s attention has been focused on Israel’s conflict with Iran, the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza has worsened by the day. Since March, when Israel broke a ceasefire agreement and imposed a total blockade, very little food or medicine has been allowed in. Though the blockade was partially lifted on 19 May, only a trickle of desperately needed aid has made it through – and yesterday Israelclosed the most direct route. Israeli forces have killed hundreds of Palestinians who are trying to access it, in what aid workers are now calling a “death trap”. Israel is fighting allegations ofgenocide in Gaza, where it haskilledmore than 55,000 people.Truly to understand the scale of the catastrophe inGaza, it’s necessary to place it in historical context. This isn’t just a crisis born in 2023: it’s the culmination of nearly two decades of siege.For today’s newsletter, I spoke to British-Palestinian economistZayne Abudaka, senior fellow at the Institute for Social and Economic Progress in Ramallah, about how Gaza’s years of economic strangulation has shaped the current crisis. That’s after the headlines.Five big storiesMiddle East crisis| Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, hasthreatenedto respond to any future US attack by striking American military bases in the Middle East.Welfare| Keir Starmer hasoffered Labour MPs “massive concessions”on his controversial welfare bill in a move that has won over key rebels and is likely to have saved the prime minister from a damaging Commons defeat.

With the support of Egypt, Israel sealed Gaza by land, sea and air, devastating its economy, driving unemployment to record levels and leaving the population dependent on aid to survive.Though it may seem impossibly distant now, life before 2007 was very different, even though Israeli forces were still occupying Gaza. “A lot of people talk about those times as better: there was more money, and a better economy,” Zayne Abudaka said. According to UN Trade and Development, real GDP per capita in Gaza dropped by more than 27% between 2006 and 2022.Here’s how that happened – and how it shaped the current catastrophe.What was Gaza like before the blockade?Before the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, a Palestinian in Gaza could get in a car and drive to Haifa in Israel without checkpoints or permits. “Obviously there were no civil rights, there was a lot of oppression, because you had an entire national identity without self-determination,” Abudaka said. “But in terms of freedom of mobility, access to resources, and opening a business, it was pretty straightforward.”Before the formation of the Palestinian Authority (PA), the economy relied heavily on productive industries like farming, although farmers were, and still are, regularly harassed by Israelis, Abudaka said. Then the PA created a huge raft of public sector jobs. “So all the people whose kids were going to become farmers, they started telling the children, ‘why go through this headache? Why don’t you work for the PA?’”The influx of aid, which increased rapidly until 2013, further empowered the PA to absorb workers from different sectors. “The things that the Oslo accords had introduced, including the division of the different areas, lack of access to borders and to energy generation created a situation whereby the only jobs that were increasing were public sector and international NGO jobs,” Abduka said. “And all the productive jobs like industry and agriculture started dying down.” He points to a stark statistic: in 1996, more than 20% of the Palestinian territories’ GDP came from industry. Today, it hovers around 10%.When the second intifada eruptedin 2000, the deaths of thousands of Palestinians and Israelis were accompanied by an intensifying Israeli occupation and the destruction of key infrastructure. “We lost 30 to 40% of our GDP in a single year,” Abudaka said. “Cities were under siege, curfews were imposed, you couldn’t leave your house. It was a dramatic escalation in violence. People were left feeling desperate.”What has been the impact of the siege?After Israel imposed its blockade, trade and investment collapsed. “Unfortunately the PA did not direct its finances to investing in the economic productive base,” Abudaka said. “So you have a lack of investment, less jobs, and end up in a situation where two-thirds of young people are unemployed.”The siege imposed restrictions on a list of items that it was claimed that Hamas could use to make weapons and rockets – many of which were essentials for civilian life. It included wedding dresses, baby bottles and nappies, and water and sewage pumps.Agriculture also suffered from the territory’s extreme density. Gaza spans just 360 sq km, and its population grew significantly before the war. As a result, traditional farmland quickly became overbuilt. “In the north of Gaza, there was an area called Sheikh Ijlin, which was known for really good grapes. The area has 300,000 people living in one sq km. If you had walked in that area, you would have seen buildings and grapes side by side.”How did Gaza try to adapt?Gaza’s local authorities set out new rules to manage the siege economy. “You would go on the ministry website and see how many dunams, a unit of area, of every single plant they had. So they managed to say, ‘We need this many tomatoes, so we’ll do that’,” Abudaka said.In some ways, Gaza’s strangled economy had the potential to function better than the more prosperous West Bank’s. “The West Bank is not one continuous area,” Abudaka said. “The PA controls these tiny islands that are surrounded by settlements. Although Gaza was seized, it was one area. So the people living there had control over their resources, which meant that they had services that worked. They had agriculture production despite everything.”But these adapted resources were battered by the wars that followed in 2008, 2012, 2014, 2021, and 2023. After each war came promises of reconstruction, but only a fraction of the aid money that was pledged ever materialised, Abudaka said.Israel wanted reassurances that aid that went in couldn’t fund Hamas’s military activity, Abudaka said. “This led to the creation of the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism, which is a security arrangement where Israeli security checks the goods that enter. It didn’t stop Hamas from building tunnels. It did annihilate Gaza’s economy.”What does the future hold for those living there?What is now unfolding in Gaza is a process of “de-development,” Abudaka said. In 2006, about 63% of Palestinians in Gaza relied on aid. Today, almost all of Gaza’s 2.3 million inhabitants depend on humanitarian assistance.A smaller, yet still damaging version of this is playing out in the occupied West Bank. Abudaka pointed to the banking system as one example. “Because we don’t have our own currency, we use four, including the Israeli shekel. But we can’t deposit physical shekels with the Israeli central bank unless we prove where they came from. So Palestinian banks end up holding piles of cash they can’t use. That limits lending, which hurts growth,” he said.Another issue is clearance revenues. “Because we don’t have a customs authority at the border, the Israeli authorities will collect that tax in our place. And then they’ll send us the money back, but we have to show them receipts, which is often impossible because we don’t control the borders. Then we go to the Israelis and say, ‘You owe us 100m.’ And they say, ‘No … we’re keeping the other 50m because you didn’t provide all the receipts. On top of that, the Israelis take 3% as a fee.”Now far-right finance ministerBezalel Smotrichis trying to stop the money altogether. “But this isn’t the whole story … He wants the PA to be simply a military force that looks Palestinian, but is actually Israeli. A force that controls Palestinians, but doesn’t provide them with services.”This crushing Israeli control over every facet of ordinary life, Abudaka said, is forcing young Palestinians to confront a difficult question. “You do see a lot of Palestinian young people who are saying, listen, I love my country. I just don’t have a future,” he says. “We have really been steadfast, but this can’t go on.”What else we’ve been readingView image in fullscreenLocals in Lisbon, Portugal, were priced out of the city after the 2008 financial crisis.Photograph: Michael Probst/APKirsty Major kicks offa fascinating series on Europe’s housing crisis and how it’s stoking support for the far right – but, she reports, it doesn’t have to be this way.

Homophobic comments and an “unhappy working environment” were also reported.A separatereport from a cathedral “visitation” teamrecommended the appointment of “strong leadership” to “steady the ship”, improved scrutiny of governance and finances, and discouraging unkind and inappropriate private communications.According to Tim Wyatt, who writesThe Critical Friend, a newsletter on the Anglican church, and who has closely followed events at Bangor, the reports “pretty much confirmed there was a lot of drinking, sleeping around, backbiting, bullying – basically a whole culture that was completely out of kilter with what a place of Christian worship is supposed to be about”.View image in fullscreenBangor cathedral. Andy John, who is also the bishop of Bangor, said he was announcing his ‘immediate retirement’.Photograph: UK City Images/AlamyIn addition, six “serious incident reports” have been sent to the Charity Commission in the past 18 months, four relating to safeguarding and two relating to financial matters.Financial irregularities reportedly includemore than £400,000 being spent on new furnishings for the cathedral with inadequate consultation, and £20,000 spent on trips to Rome and Dublin for senior staff.A spokesperson for the Charity Commission said: “We have opened a regulatory compliance case to assess a number of concerns that have been raised related to Bangor cathedral and diocese, including matters reported directly to us by the charities. We are actively examining these matters with the charities’ trustees to determine our next steps.“As regulator, if we find evidence of wrongdoing, we take robust action using the powers available to us.”Many of the concerns about the cathedral centre on a period when Siôn Rhys Evans was its acting dean – in effect chief executive – while continuing in post as secretary of the Bangor diocese. Both posts are senior full-time jobs, and it is unprecedented for one person to manage both sets of responsibilities and workloads.In another highly unusual move, Rhys Evans – who was seen as a protege of John – was made acting dean only a few years after being ordained as a priest. To be elevated so quickly to a high-profile job was an “astounding over-promotion”, according to Wyatt.In February 2024, Rhys Evans stood back from both roles without explanation. He was absent from work for 10 months, after which he quietly left to take up a new post as dean of a Westminster theological college in Cambridge.On Friday, Westminster college confirmed that Rhys Evans’ probationary period was “unsuccessful” and he had left his job in mid-May. The Guardian has been unable to contact him.Last month, two members of the cathedral’s college of priests, Rev Dr John Prysor-Jones and the Very Rev Prof Gordon McPhate, called for an independent inquiry into events in Bangor. “The reputational damage to the cathedral, the diocese, and the Church in Wales is considerable,” they said in aletter to the Church Times.Ruth Jones, the Labour MP for Newport West and Islwyn, said the church must give a full explanation to members and the public. “We want openness and transparency in all our church settings and it’s really, really important that the archbishop makes clear what has gone on,” she toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast.Explore more on these topicsAnglicanismWalesChristianityReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

The details of the deal, which was part of amajor resetin EU-UK relations announced in May, are still being thrashed out and experts believe this could take up to a year.View image in fullscreenStuart Machin called on the government to rapidly reset relations with the EU.Photograph: Oliver Dixon/PAEarlier this month the government said that before the final deal, it was scrapping plans to introduce checks this summer on EU imports of “medium-risk fruit and vegetables”, such as tomatoes, peppers, grapes, plums and cherries.Machin said “The government’s SPS deal with the EU will be gamechanging, and it can’t come soon enough!”From 1 July the final phase of the Windsor framework, which was designed to protect the EU single market and stop British goods leaking into the bloc via the Republic of Ireland, comes into force, requiring some goods to hold the “not for the EU” labels.The deal was a compromise to obviate the need for some border checks on fresh foods such as sausages.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many MPs are still undecided about how they will vote and are pressing for more assurances that it is ethical and legal to set up a division between current and future claimants.Disability charities have said the bill remains “fatally flawed” and will lead to an “unequal future” for different groups of disabled people, making life harder for hundreds of thousands of future claimants.The government confirmed on Friday night that people who have to make new claims for Pip after November 2026 will be assessed under the new criteria. This means those reapplying after losing their Pip or who have fluctuating health conditions will not have the level of their previous awards protected.Starmer defended the bill on Friday, saying it struck the right balance. The changes will protect 370,000 existing recipients who were expected to lose out after reassessment.The prime minister said: “We talked to colleagues, who’ve made powerful representations, as a result of which we’ve got a package which I think will work, we can get it right.”Reeves expected to freeze income tax thresholds to raise funds after welfare U-turnRead moreAsked how the government would pay for the £3bn of concessions, which experts believe will have to be funded by tax rises or extra borrowing, Starmer replied: “The funding will be set out in the budget in the usual way, as you’d expect, later in the year.”There would need to be at least 80 rebels to defeat the bill, and government sources were quietly confident they had given enough ground after Meg Hillier, the chair of the Treasury committee, said she would back the legislation following changes.Others were unconvinced. One leading rebel said “everyone but a handful of people is unhappy”, even if they do end up reluctantly backing the changed legislation. Another expressed frustration that No 10 and the whips were “trying to bounce people into agreeing before we’ve seen enough details”.Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, a leading opponent of the bill, said: “They are going to have to go back to the negotiating table … deaf and disabled people’s organisations are rejecting these changes as it fails to address future need and gives no security for people with fluctuating conditions, for instance where people are in remission.”View image in fullscreenThere have been widespread protests against the bill since it was announced.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyOther critics who plan to vote against the bill include the MP for Crawley, Peter Lamb, who said: “Despite many improvements to the system set out in the bill, at its core the bill remains a cost-cutting exercise. No matter the level of involvement of disability groups in co-producing a scheme for new applicants, to save money the new scheme has to result in people with high levels of need losing the support necessary to wash themselves, dress themselves and feed themselves.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bill should be scrapped and we should start again and put the needs of disabled people at the centre of the process.”Diane Abbott, a leading figure from the left of Labour, said the rebellion was “far from over”, while another Labour MP said: “The bill starts from the premise of cuts, not reform. It’s also arse about face in terms of impact assessments and co-production. It’s simply a negotiated dog’s dinner. In that sense, nothing has really changed except the fact they’ve negotiated more [people to] misguidedly to sign up to it.”One thing Labour MPs are pushing for is more clarity on the review of the Pip system, due to be done before autumn by Stephen Timms, a work and pensions minister. Many expect that process to change the points system from the current proposals. Some in the party also want Starmer to reinstate Vicky Foxcroft, who quit as a whip to vote against the bill before the U-turn was made.Stella Creasy, a leading Labour MP who had initially signed the amendment to delay the bill, said she wanted to see more details. “We need to understand why we would treat one group of claimants differently from another,” she said.A Labour MP from the 2024 intake said: “I’m waiting to look at the details before making any decisions. Many are in the same place as me and need to get something more than a midnight email on an issue of this much importance to hundreds of thousands of people.”The Labour MPs opposed to the changes are citing a fundamental rejection of the idea that a Labour government will be making disabled people worse off. At the same time, many of them have also been alienated by what they say is a No 10 operation that is out of touch with the parliamentary party, and has tried to strongarm MPs into backing the legislation with threats and promises of preferment.“Good will has been lost and there is still huge suspicion about whether they will try and pull a stunt at the last minute,” said one Labour MP.The majority of disability charities and campaign groups still opposed the cuts. Ellen Clifford, from Disabled People Against Cuts, said: “Many people who rely on Pip to survive have fluctuating conditions which means our support needs can go up and down. By penalising existing claimants if we go out of and then go back to the benefits system depending on our health, more people will be denied the support they need.“This is exactly why no disabled people’s organisation across the whole of the UK has welcomed these concessions because we know the complexities of the social security system and bitter experience from years of cuts that there are many ways in which grand sweeping statements about protections translate to very little in practice when you go into the detail of it.”The disability equality charity Scope said that despite the concessions, an estimated 430,000 future disabled claimants would be affected by 2029-30.Welfare bill: what compromises have been made and how will claimants be affected?Read moreIts strategy director, James Taylor, said: “It is encouraging that the government is starting to listen to disabled people and MPs who have been campaigning for change for months. But these plans will still rip billions from the welfare system.“The proposed concessions will create a two-tier benefits system and an unequal future for disabled people. Life costs more if you are disabled. And these cuts will have a devastating effect on disabled people’s health, ability to live independently or work.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareKeir StarmerEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

No final decision has been made.Workers at the factory, in a former second world war bomber facility, have not been informed of the plans. Lotus declined to comment on “rumours and speculation”.If the company goes ahead with the plan it is likely to be heavily criticised in the UK, as it comes only eight years after Geely took majority control of the British company in 2017. A previous leader at the company said in 2023 that making cars in the UK was “part of our DNA”.The Norfolk factory has not built any cars since mid-May. The company said in a statement that it had paused production to manage inventories and supply chain issues caused by the US’s extra 25% tariffs on car imports. UK car production fell to its lowest level since 1949 in May in response to the tariffs.The factory could close as soon as next year, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the development.Lotus was founded in 1948 by the car engineer Colin Chapman and gained a reputation for lightweight British sportscars. Geely, which is owned by the billionaire Li Shufu, has stakes in a wide range of car companies, from the UK’s Aston Martin to Germany’s Mercedes-Benz and Sweden’s Volvo. InChina, Geely makes vehicles under its own name, as well as under the Lynk & Co and Zeeker brands.Geely also owns the London Electric Vehicle Company, themaker of London black cabs.Since taking over Lotus, Geely has shifted its focus to China, where it makes its electric SUV, the Eletre. In 2023,Geely listed the electric carmaking arm of the business, Lotus Technology, on the New York stock exchange.Geely had planned to increase annual production to 150,000 by 2028, with the bulk of those cars made in Wuhan, China. However, the New York listing left the original Lotus business in the UK standing alone without access to the same significant investment as the Chinese operations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The number of people in the UK paying income tax at the higher rate is already expected toincrease by 500,000 this tax year, to 7 million.“The most obvious thing would be to extend the income tax thresholds, for another two years,” said Ruth Curtice, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank – which estimates that the U-turn on disability benefits will cost the chancellor £3bn a year by 2029-30.That bill comes in addition to the £1.25bn price of Reeves’s recent decision toreverse most of the cut to pensioners’ winter fuel allowance– and thewidely held expectationthat the Office for Budget Responsibility will downgrade its growth forecasts in the autumn.The Treasury’s independent watchdog is revisiting its estimate of productivity – a key determinant of economic growth – which looks optimistic relative to most independent forecasts.Paul Johnson, the outgoing director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the U-turns on benefits could be dwarfed by the probable downgrade from the OBR.“In one way this [the welfare U-turn] doesn’t change anything very much – it’s a £3bn-£4bn change at the end of the period, and the OBR forecast could change things by a lot more than that – but obviously if the OBR moves in the wrong direction then this adds to the pressure,” he said.Reeves's tax policy choicesJohnson pointed out that the most straightforward ways of raising large enough sums had been ruled out by Labour’s pre-election tax pledges. “There are always ways of finding small numbers of billions, but if you are looking for £10bn or £20bn it gets really quite difficult, if you’re not going to increase income tax or VAT,” he said, adding, “the threshold freeze is obviously the politically easiest thing to do.”Simon Wells, the chief European economist at HSBC, agreed. “They’re boxed in and something has to give,” he said. “The income tax thresholds is by far and away the line of least resistance.”Mujtaba Rahman, managing director at the consultancy Eurasia Group, said: “Reeves may have to find up to £20bn to balance the books and give her enough headroom for future emergencies from a series of small-scale changes. They are likely to include extending the freeze on income tax thresholds and allowances for another two years.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s just one of a number of factors that will affect the next forecast that the Office for Budget Responsibility will produce.”However, there is also frustration in government at the way the OBR’s forecasting process, combined with the slim £10bn of headroom Reeves has againsther fiscal rules, has led to constant market speculation about the chancellor’s next move.One proposal made recently by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was for just one OBR forecast a year. The Treasury is sceptical about this idea, as it would make the UK an international outlier – but officials are understood to be looking at the nature of the spring forecast.Downgrading its role could prevent the scramble for savings seen in the run up to this year’s spring statement which led to the welfare cuts.The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, this weekwarnedagainst “over-interpreting” the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts.Explore more on these topicsIncome taxRachel ReevesTax and spendingOffice for Budget ResponsibilityBudget deficitEconomic policyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The album, Never Stop, credits King Combs, 27, as the lyricist, and Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, as a producer.Prosecutors have accused Sean Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Records, of running a criminal enterprise that engaged in sex trafficking, drug distribution, kidnapping, forced labor, arson and bribery, and coercing women, including his former partner singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, into participating in drug-fueled sex marathons.Combs’s legal troubles kicked off in late 2023 when Venturafiled a lawsuitaccusing him of rape and severe physical abuse over the course of a decade, and said he used his power and status to keep her trapped in the relationship. The lawsuit wassettledthe following day for $20m, but Combs soon faced dozens of lawsuits from others accusing him of sexual and physical abuse.This week’s lawsuit claims that in 2017 Justin Combs, 31, lured the alleged victim, an “accomplished, degreed professional”, to Los Angeles with the possibility of a job, promising to use his father’s connections. She was, the suit alleges, flown to Los Angeles and taken to a high-end Beverly Hills property where she was eventually drugged and repeatedly raped by Justin Combs and his father and two “unknown, masked” men over the course of a weekend.Justin Combs allegedly held the potential job “over [the] plaintiff’s head” as well as “risque” photos she had sent him.The suit accuses Sean Combs of a “pervasive history of sexual assault and violence”.“The conduct described herein is strikingly similar to how [the] defendant Sean Combs and his entourage conducted themselves for many years, and it appears that Combs’s penchant for sexual violence is shared by his son,” the suit states.The woman is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for the assault, which, according to the suit, left her with “severe emotional distress, emotional anguish, fear, anxiety, humiliation, embarrassment, physical injury, emotional injury and trauma”.In a statement to media, Combs’s legal team denied the allegations, stating that “anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason”.The statement said: “No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won’t change the fact that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone – man or woman, adult or minor.”Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

The killings and subsequent manhunt unsettled the state.On Friday, Minnesotans lined up by the hundreds outside and inside the state capitol to pay their respects. One by one, they moved toward the rotunda. Many wiped away tears. Others did the sign of the cross. Some put their hands on their hearts. The mourners included former president Joe Biden.‘True model of humility’: hundreds pay tribute to victims of Minnesota killingsRead moreSome brought their children, waiting in line patiently to say goodbye. Many carried flowers – daffodils, daisies, zinnias, roses. Golden retrievers sat outside the doors of the capitol, waiting people to pet them and to comfort those who came to grieve.A second line waited to drop off flowers and other items of remembrance at a memorial upstairs near the House chambers. There, thousands of flowers decorated a hallway of tables. Interspersed were dog treats, stuffed animals and hundreds of notes from people who told the Hortmans what they meant to Minnesota.One photo left at the memorial shows Hortman behind a lectern with the presidential seal, noting that she was one of a group of state lawmakers invited to Washington by then-president Barack Obama. “I can’t comprehend her being gone, but I’m realizing how much I loved her,” wrote the person who left the photo.“Remembering your strong leadership for low-income Minnesotans and your dedication to policies so that all people have a home,” one sign said.“Melissa is our hero,” wrote another.Melissa is the first woman in Minnesota history to lie in state at the Capitol. She joins a long list of Minnesota governing greats – a list her colleagues say she deserves to be on for her accomplishments. Tim Walz, the governor, has called her the “most consequential House speaker in state history”.One man got to the capitol at 6.30am to wait for the doors to open at noon, hetold Minnesota Public Radio. Mike Starr said he once was hosted by the Hortmans at their home and wanted to pay his respects and show thanks for everything Melissa had done for the state.“She stood up for the people and that she didn’t spin the story, she didn’t mislead people,” Starr said. “She let you know who she was. And you know, when she said something, she meant it.”Some came from out of state to say goodbye. Debra Lehrmann, Texas supreme court justice and a friend of the Hortmans, came to the capitol,according to the Star Tribune. “Melissa is the kind of person you’re drawn to,” she told the paper.In the days since her death, her friends and colleagues – and those who didn’t personally know her, but felt her impact –have sharedwhat she meant to them. They cited an ability to bring people together and find common ground alongside a whip-smart intellect and a witty sense of humor.Above all, she cared about Minnesota – and Minnesota cared back.Explore more on these topicsMinnesotanewsShareReuse this content"

This year’s $321bn spending plan was negotiated by legislative leaders and the Democratic governor,Gavin Newsom.Newsom is expected to sign the budget. But it will be void if lawmakers don’t send him legislation to make it easier to build housing by Monday.The budget avoids some of the most devastating cuts to essential safety net programs, state leaders said. They mostly relied on using state savings, borrowing from special funds and delaying payments to plug the budget hole.Gavin Newsom sues Fox News for defamation and demands $787mRead moreCalifornia also faces potential federal cuts to healthcare programs and broad economic uncertainty that could force even deeper cuts. Newsom in May estimated that federal policies – including on tariffs and immigration enforcement – could reduce state tax revenue by $16bn.“We’ve had to make some tough decisions,” Mike McGuire, the senate president pro tempore, said on Friday. “I know we’re not going to please everyone, but we’re doing this without any new taxes on everyday Californians.”Republican lawmakers said they were left out of budget negotiations. They also criticizedDemocratsfor not doing enough to address future deficits, which could range between $17bn to $24bn annually.“We’re increasing borrowing, we’re taking away from the rainy day fund, and we’re not reducing our spending,” said Tony Strickland, a Republican state senator, before the vote. “And this budget also does nothing about affordability in California.”Here’s a look at spending in key areas:Under the budget deal, California will stop enrolling new adult patients without legal status in its state-funded healthcare program for low-income people starting in 2026. The state will also implement a $30 monthly premium in July 2027 for immigrants remaining on the program, including some with legal status. The premiums would apply to adults under 60 years old.The changes to the program, known as Medi-Cal, are a scaled-back version of Newsom’s proposal in May. Still, it is a major blow to an ambitious program started last year to help the state inch closer to a goal of universal healthcare.A Democratic state senator, María Elena Durazo, broke with her party and voted “no” on the healthcare changes, calling them a betrayal of immigrant communities.The deal also removes $78m in funding for mental health phone lines, including a program that served 100,000 people annually. It will eliminate funding that helps pay for dental services for low-income people in 2026 and delay implementation of legislation requiring health insurance to cover fertility services by six months to 2026.But lawmakers also successfully pushed back on several proposed cuts from Newsom that they called “draconian”.The deal secures funding for a program providing in-home domestic and personal care services for some low-income residents and Californians with disabilities. It also avoids cuts to Planned Parenthood.Lawmakers agreed to let the state tap $1bn from its cap-and-trade program to fund state firefighting efforts. The cap-and-trade program is a market-based system aimed at reducing carbon emissions. Companies have to buy credits to pollute, and that money goes into a fund lawmakers are supposed to tap for climate-related spending.Newsom wanted to reauthorize the program through 2045, with a guarantee that $1bn would annually go to the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project. The budget does not make that commitment, as lawmakers wanted to hash out spending plans outside of the budget process. The rail project currently receives 25% of the cap-and-trade proceeds, which is roughly $1bn annually depending on the year.Legislative leaders also approved funding to help transition part-time firefighters into full-time positions. Many state firefighters only work nine months each year, which lawmakers said harms the state’s ability to prevent and fight wildfires. The deal includes $10m to increase the daily wage for incarcerated firefighters, who earn $5.80 to $10.24 a day currently.The budget agreement will provide $80m to help implement atough-on-crime initiativevoters overwhelmingly approved last year. The measure makes shoplifting a felony for repeat offenders, increases penalties for some drug charges and gives judges the authority to order people with multiple drug charges into treatment.Most of the fund, $50m, will help counties build more behavioral health beds. Probation officers will get $15m for pre-trial services and courts will receive $20m to support increased caseloads.In California, Trump finds his perfect antagonistRead moreAdvocates of the measure – including sheriffs, district attorneys and probation officers – said that was not enough money. Some have estimated it would take about $400m for the first year of the program.Newsom and lawmakers agreed to raise the state’s film tax credit from $330m to $750m annually to boost Hollywood. The program, a priority for Newsom, will start this year and expire in 2030.The budget provides $10m to help support immigration legal services, including deportation defense.But cities and counties will not see new funding to help them address homelessness next year, which local leaders said could lead to the loss of thousands of shelter beds.The budget also does not act on Newsom’s proposal to streamline a project to create a vast underground tunnel to reroute a big part of the state’s water supply.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaUS politicsWest CoastGavin NewsomDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

The news sent US stock markets to fresh highs amid news of widerefforts to end the trade warsbetween the US and the world’s biggest economies.Donald Trump said on Thursday that the US had signed a deal withChinathe previous day, without providing additional details, and that there might be a separate deal coming up that would “open up” India.But the trade news was complicated on Friday afternoon when Trump announced he hadcalled offtalks with Canada over a digital sales tax. The S&P and the Nasdaq turned negative before recovering their losses.China confirmed the details of the deal on Friday, and reiterated that it will continue to approve the export permits of controlled items. The news sent US stock markets to new highs on Friday morning with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting record levels.DuringUS-China trade talks in Mayin Geneva, Beijing committed to removing non-tariff countermeasures imposed against the US since 2 April, although it was unclear how some of those measures would be walked back.The world wants China’s rare earth elements – what is life like in the city that produces them?Read moreAs part of its retaliation against new US tariffs, China suspended exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets,upending the supply chainscentral to automakers, aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors around the world.“The administration and China agreed to an additional understanding for a framework to implement the Geneva agreement,” a White House official said on Thursday.The understanding is “about how we can implement expediting rare-earth shipments to the US again”, the official said.A separate administration official said the US-China agreement took place earlier this week.Rare earth minerals chartChina has avirtual monopolyon the global supply of rare earths, having grown to dominate production and processing in the 1990s and the 2000s. Some of the rare earths mined in China are used in US military equipment, a vulnerability that has been laid bare in the US-China trade war.The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told Bloomberg: “They’re going to deliver rare earths to us” and once China did that, “we’ll take down our countermeasures”.The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on Friday that he hoped the US could reach trade agreements with more than a dozen nations by September – comments that suggest the White House has all but scrapped the 9 July deadline it had set to conclude negotiations before reimposing its more draconian “reciprocal tariffs”.“I think we could have trade wrapped up by Labor Day [1 September],” Bessent said on Fox Business Network. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Thursday that the 9 July deadline was “not critical”.While the agreement shows potential progress after months of trade uncertainty and disruption since Trump took office in January, it also underscores the long road ahead to a final, definitive trade deal between the two economic rivals.China has been taking its dual-use restrictions on rare earths “very seriously” and has been vetting buyers to ensure that materials are not diverted to US military uses, according to an industry source. This has slowed down the licensing process.The Wall Street Journal reported this week that China has told rare-earth companies to provide the government with a list of workers with technical expertise and has asked some to turn in their passports to prevent them from taking unauthorised overseas trips. China wants to ensure that its commercially valuable rare earths knowledge is not shared with foreign adversaries.Car manufacturers have already complained about factories being brought to a near halt because of supply chain shortages of rare earths and the magnets they are used in. A Ford executive said this week that the company was living “hand to mouth”.The Geneva deal had faltered over China’s curbs on critical minerals exports, prompting the Trump administration to respond with export controls of its own, preventing shipments of semiconductor design software, aircraft and other goods to China.In early June, Reuters reported that China had granted temporary export licences to rare-earth suppliers of the top three US automakers as supply chain disruptions began to surface from export curbs on those materials.Later in the month, Trump said there was a deal with China in which Beijing would supply magnets and rare-earth minerals while the US would allow Chinese students to study in its colleges and universities.Reuters contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsInternational tradeChinaGlobal economyAsia PacificUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

We intend to fully mitigate the impact of these headwinds over time.”Last yearalmost 60% of all Nike-branded apparelwas made in Vietnam, China and Cambodia. Vietnam, Indonesia and Chinamanufactured 95% of all Nike footwear last year.“We have strong relationships with our factory partners, and our leadership team is experienced in managing through disruption,” Friend said. “Nike has consistently been a top payer of US duties. We will optimise our sourcing mix and allocate production differently across countries to mitigate the new cost headwind into the United States.”He said manufacturing capacity and capability still remains important to the company, despite the 60% tariff rate imposed by the US, accounting for about 16% of footwear imports to America.Friend said the business was working to minimise the impact on consumers.However, he added that the company would implement a “surgical price increase” in the US from this autumn, and will aim to reduce overheads through “corporate cost reduction”.Friend’s comments came as Nike reported its worst quarterly earnings in more than three years, as revenues slumped 12% to $11.1bn in the three months to the end of May.Elliott Hill, the chief executive of Nike, said: “The results are where we planned.

In short, all options remain on the table.”The commission is responsible for trade on behalf of the EU’s 27 member states, but wanted a steer on how to approach the economically critical talks with the White House. Trump hasthreatened to impose 50% tariffs on all EU goods from 9 Julyunless the two sides reach a deal. Most EU goods already face a 10% tariff, with levies of 25% on cars and car parts and 50% on steel and aluminium.Von der Leyen also floated a “beginning of redesigning” the World Trade Organization amid concern the global trading system is being undermined by trade wars and bilateral deals. She said the Asia Pacific CPTPP bloc,which also includes the UK, was interested in “structured collaboration” with the EU, which wanted the same. “We can think about this as a beginning of redesigning the WTO … to show the world that free trade with a large number of countries is possible on a rules-based foundation,” she said.As Trump’s deadline draws near, differences are emerging between Germany and France over how to handle the US talks.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said a quick and simple trade deal was better than “slow and complicated”. The new centre-right chancellor is under heavy pressure from German carmakers and other exporters, some of whom argue that an asymmetric deal – ie higher US tariffs on European goods – may be better than no deal.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, argued that accepting an unequal trading relationship would be damaging to Europe’s long-term competitiveness. One EU diplomat rejected the suggestion member states were divided, but said: “If we accept 10%, how long will it last?”, suggesting Trump could launch a new front in the trade war, or that it could affect negotiations with other trading partners. “Many member states realise this is not only one game. Maybe it will affect the way India approaches us, or China.”Ireland’s prime minister, Micheál Martin, said: “Getting a deal is important for certainty so that we know the landscape ahead of us and that industry knows the landscape ahead of it, so that we can protect jobs, which is our number one priority.”Striking a more outspoken note, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said Trump’s tariff threat was “doubly unfair”, because his country runs a trade deficit with the US. He was responding after Trump said Spain would “pay twice as much”, after Sánchezrefused to commit to the 5% Nato spending target.Diplomats are increasingly pessimistic about negotiating away the 10% baseline tariffs. As this reality sinks in, two approaches are emerging: a quick deal that would mean certainty for business, or retaliation to press for something better. “Do we go into aggressive retaliation mode or are we less vocal and do a quick deal,” said one source.The US has shown little obvious interest in theEU’s offer of a “zero-for-zero” free-trade zone on industrial goods, while continuing to attack the bloc’s tech regulation and VAT rules. Earlier this week, von der Leyen reiterated that changes to the EU’s Digital Markets Act –regulations affecting US tech companies– was off the table. “Of course we discuss tariff lines, we discuss non-tariff barriers like standards and norms … but where it is the sovereign decision-making process in the European Union and its member states that is affected this is too far.”Belgium’s prime minister, Bart De Wever, said tariffs should be avoided at all costs. “So we will not allow ourselves to be provoked, we will remain calm, we will negotiate and we hope to reach an agreement. If this is not the case, we will naturally adopt countermeasures, but these will be appropriate countermeasures,” he said.The EU hassuspended levies on €21bn (£18bn) US goods until mid-July to allow more time for negotiations.The bloc is consulting on further retaliatory tariffs targeting €95bn of US goods, although the final total is likely to be smaller, if approved. The EU previouslydropped plans to target American bourbon,after protests from France and Ireland, who feared retaliation against French cognac and Irish whiskey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also suggested the EU should concentrate on negotiating in five sectors including the automotive and steel industries, which have been already been hit with tariffs, and pharmaceuticals, which remain in Trump’s crosshairs.Peter Leibinger, the president of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said at the same conference that he [Merz] needed to “carry the pain” being felt by German manufacturers to the Brussels bubble.The BDI said the tariffs would cost the German economy approximately 0.3 percentage points of growth, depressing an economy “where industrial production remains significantly below the pre-crisis level of 2019”.The EU’s chief trade negotiator, Maroš Šefčovič, said: “The car industry of Europe, it’s clearly bleeding. And really to have tariffs at the level of 27.5%, which is a scary state, it is clearly unsustainable.” Carmakers face a 25% tariff, in addition to the 2.5% that pre-dated Trump’s second term.Šefčovič said his “one wish” was unity in the EU’s approach. He was “ready to fight tooth and nail” for the EU’s interests, telling German business leaders to “talk to us, criticise us, but support us”.He also revealed he was seeking an insurance clause in any deal: “I think it would be clearly desirable … that we would have some kind of stand still clause, which would kind of prevent a surprise with sudden spikes [in tariffs] and volatility.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionEuropeTrump tariffsInternational tradeDonald TrumpEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

(Cox says the edit “amounted to suggesting a small change” and noted that he has also obtainedpublicresearch funding.)View image in fullscreenCox has previously done some work for the tobacco industry.Photograph: Oliver Helbig/Getty ImagesBoth the tobacco and oil industries have a history ofweaponizing scientific uncertainty, experts say, with some arguing that similar tactics drive the Trump administration’s current deregulatory efforts. The president’s May “gold standard” science order, for instance, empowered his appointees to “correct scientific information” and “discipline” those who breach the administration’s views, promptingoutragefrom some scientists.Cox has obtainedfundingto develop the new AI reviewer from the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the nation’s largest chemical industry advocacy group, which counts oil and chemical giants such as Exxon and DuPont as members.Experts say the ACC’s sponsorship raises questions about whom the project will benefit.Asked about these concerns, Kelly Montes de Oca, spokesperson for the ACC, said: “This research has the potential to support scientific understanding and analysis of chemical exposure and human health, enhance transparency and reproducibility, advance the safety of chemical products and processes, and inform science-based global regulatory approaches.”Cox said in an email to the Guardian that his assistant “is specifically designed to be helpful to those who wish to understand the objective implications of data without any distortions from the kinds of well-known human heuristics and biases that make objective analysis difficult for humans”.“My work aims to help anyone interested in using sound technical methods to pursue scientific truth,” he added. The questions sent to him by the Guardian contained “many fundamental inaccuracies”, he said.Some critics have mischaracterized my work as an attempt to delay regulation or promote industry interests. That is not trueLouis Anthony ‘Tony’ Cox JrCox said the tool is currently being tested on submissions to academic journals – including Risk Analysis, which he edits – to evaluate research submissions before they are submitted to the peer review process.Asked for a response to concerns about the project’s funding, Cox said that he has publicly acknowledged the ACC’s support in all relevant publications and said the tool “has no axe to grind and no positions to push”.But the ACC is not a neutral force, said Chris Frey, the associate dean for research and infrastructure at the North Carolina State University’s College of Engineering who chaired the Environmental Protection Agency’s clean air scientific advisory committee from 2012 to 2015.“They lack impartiality in that they want to minimize regulatory burden on their members,” said Frey.ChatGPTIn mid-February of 2023, Cox struck up a conversation with the AI assistant ChatGPT. He later sent the chat to his University of Colorado email address,which is subject to public record request laws.After asking the chatbot to write a sonnet about Abraham Lincoln, he turned the conversation to a more serious topic: the tiny toxic particles known as PM2.5, also known as fine particulate matter.Scientists have long found links between PM2.5 exposure and awide variety of health concerns, from asthma and lung disease to heart attacks. But for years, Cox has raised uncertainty about those connections, publishing work“re-assessing” the mortality risks associated with exposure to the pollutantin animal agriculture and challenging the link between PM2.5 fromgas stoves and childhood asthma.On that February day, Cox asked ChatGPT a simple question: “Does PM2.5 cause lung cancer?” The bot responded by noting the “strong scientific evidence” demonstrating the link.A seemingly dissatisfied Cox went on to ask if it is “known with certainty that PM2.5 causes lung cancer”, calling on ChatGPT to identify potential confounding factors in the research on the air pollutant. He took brief tangents to pose riddles to the bot and to request additional sonnets – including one about PM2.5 itself, yielding the line “no nose can catch you, for you are so fine”.Eventually, Cox asked ChatGPT whether the association between PM2.5 and lung cancer can be explained by a “combination of residual confounding, measurement errors, and modeling biases”. The bot maintained that “the observed association is likely to be real and not fully explained by these factors”.From a conversation Cox had with ChatGPT in February 2023View image in fullscreenA document showing the conversation between Cox and ChatGPT.Write a sonnet about PM2.5 and lung cancerOh, deadly PM2.5 in the air, So small and yet so full of poison’s might, A silent killer that we cannot bear, You infiltrate our lungs both day and nightAt the time of the conversation, Cox had already been interested for years in making “smarter and more trustworthy AI”, he told the Guardian. He had published a paper on the topic in 2021, and the following year – months before ChatGPT’s release – had begun developing his own AI tool. The ACC had partly funded that work, he said.Cox also had a meeting with the Long-Range Research Initiative, a lobbying group focused on “innovations in chemical safety science” which includes Exxon, just hours before he had the February 2023 ChatGPT conversation, the emails show.In an email seeking funding to develop an AI tool, Cox seemingly referenced that “long experimental chat”. Among the recipients were George Maldonado, the editor of the academic journal Global Epidemiology, and ACC toxicologist Rick Becker.Cox wrote in the email that his questions eventually led ChatGPT to “concede that we don’t actually know that PM2.5 at current ambient levels causes lung cancer in humans – but it was a struggle to get there!” The chatbot “does an excellent job of reflecting the ‘party line’ that is most prevalent on the web, fallacies and all”, Cox continued in the email. But new AI software could be used to do “‘critical thinking at scale’ (if I may be grandiose!)”, he said.The following day, Cox emailed a larger group of researchers, including Becker and two ExxonMobil scientists. ChatGPT, he wrote, “seems to me to display a very strong starting bias that can eventually be overcome by sufficiently patient questioning”. That bias involved conflating “evidence of association with evidence of causation”, he said.From an email Cox sent to industry researchers in February 2023We can help bend applications of this technology toward scaled-up critical thinking instead of scaled-up groupthink and propaganda“I am hoping to build a critical mass of interest and get some funding in this area so that we can help bend applications of this technology toward scaled-up critical thinking instead of scaled-up groupthink and propaganda,” he added.Cox’s past work may shed light on the “groupthink and propaganda” that his work questions. In one2023 studyhe co-authored, he found that exposure to the “forever chemical” known as PFOA can occur in safe doses. The research was conducted with the organization Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment, headed by thecontentious toxicologist Michael Dourson, who has also received funding from chemical makers.Anotherstudythe same year, which Cox co-authored with a Chevron toxicologist, said molybdenum – a petrochemical present in lubricants Chevron produces – was “not a risk factor for changes in serum testosterone”. And in a third2023 study, Cox said his research found no link between childhood asthma and gas stove exposure.View image in fullscreenA growing body of research shows gas stoves emit toxic compounds even when not in use.Photograph: Jena Ardell/Getty ImagesAt a2018conference, Cox also claimed there is no proven connection between air pollution and respiratory problems or heart attacks, while he said in a 2012paper– funded in part by tobacco company Philip Morris USA – that he found smoking half a pack of cigarettes daily did “not appear to be associated” with increased risk of coronary heart disease.In an email to the Guardian, Cox said the methods he applies are “drawn from the scientific mainstream – not from ideology or partisanship”.“Some critics have mischaracterized my work as an attempt to delay regulation or promote industry interests. That is not true,” he said. “I do not advocate for or against any policy outcome. I advocate for grounding decisions in empirically supported causal understanding.”Cox served as an adviser to policymakers in his role on an EPA advisory committee. He has alsoargued against the proposed tightening of a regulationat an Occupational Safety and Health Administration hearing, in his capacity as an ACC consultant.Adam Finkel, a risk analyst and environmental health sciences professor at the University of Michigan, said though he believes Cox to be in some ways a “genius” and skilled risk analyst, he also seems to be “deceiving himself and everyone else” about the impacts of bias on his research.“How you interpret any information is by imposing your preferences,” said Finkel, who is also a former director of health standards programs at the US Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety andHealthAdministration. “There is no possible way to get around imposing some set of preferences.”Some degree of uncertainty is inherent to scientific analysis. But when assessing whether or not there is a causal effect between exposure to something potentially harmful, Finkel said, Cox looks for “perfect certainty”, which “can lead to years and decades of doing nothing and harming people while you wait for the certainty to come”.This uncertainty is always present, but that of course doesn’t mean the research is wrongGretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned ScientistsWhile Finkel has “fundamental belief that our system is under-protective” when it comes to public health, Cox seems to believe the opposite.Asked for comment, Cox said: “I have never advocated that we should not act until we have certainty. Rather, I have advocated choosing to act on the best available information.” He said his work has acknowledged causal relationships betweensmoking and lung cancer,asbestos exposure and mesothelioma, and, in 2011,crystalline silica exposure and lung disease.But at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration hearing at which he spoke in 2014, Coxasserted on behalf of the ACCthat the federal government had not demonstrated a link between certain levels of silica exposure and lung disease.“He’ll accept that at very high doses, this stuff is bad for you,” said Finkel. Policy is meant to ensure that level of exposure doesn’t occur, he added.‘Socratic dialogue’Maldonado, editor of Global Epidemiology, responded positively to Cox’s AI assistant proposal, the emails from 2023 show. Within weeks, his journalpublishedanother one of Cox’s conversations with ChatGPT in his journal.“The purpose of this comment is to provide an example of a Socratic dialogue with ChatGPT about the causal interpretation of an important epidemiological association between exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) and mortality risk,” says the paper, whichstatesthat it was partly funded by the ACC and counted climate denier Steve Milloy as one of its reviewers.When the bot said “it is well-established that exposure to ambient levels of PM2.5 does increase mortality risk”, Cox accused it of confusing evidence of association with evidence of causation. Eventually, ChatGPT said: “It is not known with certainty that current ambient levels of PM2.5 increase mortality risk.”But the distinction between correlation and causation is “epidemiology 101”, said Gretchen Goldman, president of the scientific advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists, whoco-authored a 2019 papercritiquing Cox.“From day one of a study, researchers consider, analyze and guard against possible confounding factors,” said Goldman. “This uncertainty is always present, but that of course doesn’t mean the research is wrong.”View image in fullscreenCox has critiqued some proposals to strengthen controls on pollution on the grounds of imperfectly demonstrated causality.Photograph: Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesDemonstrating clear causal links between pollutants and health impacts can be complicated, especially because unlike in testing pharmaceuticals, it can be difficult and unethical to establish control groups for comparison.“If you’re looking at the effects on an actual population that’s been exposed in real life to pollutants, you can’t do those controlled types of studies,” said Frey of North Carolina State University’s College of Engineering. “That leads to thinking about ways to make inferences from real world data that might, for example, mimic a random, controlled trial.”But though demonstrating true causality can be complex, Cox has long overstated scientific uncertainty while downplaying evidence, said Frey.Science denialism often sounds convincing because it contains some truthiness to itChris Frey of the North Carolina State University’s College of Engineering“Science denialism often sounds convincing because it contains some truthiness to it or elements of truth or elements of valid points, but it’s often based on either overemphasis or omission and doesn’t portray a full picture,” he said.As chair of EPA’s clean air scientific advisory committee during Trump’s first presidential term, for instance, Cox proposedeliminatingall research from the agency’s consideration that did not demonstrate “manipulative causation”, wherein intervention on one variable would change the probability of an outcome. “I see it as being about using widely accepted, non-controversial principles of causal analysis and inference,” Cox said of his push for this change.But in effect, the alteration would have dramatically and unnecessarily “winnowed down” the body of evidence to which the EPA could have referred and removed research from consideration which “in fact robustly” demonstrates that certain compoundscause harm, Frey said.“That effort and his work generally have not been viewed as compelling by the mainstream scientific community,” he added.Industry interests have promoted uncertainty to defend their business models, Frey said. The oil sector, for instance, had strong evidence that fossil fuels warmed the planet as early as the 1950s yetpubliclycalled the link “weak” or even “non-existent” for decades. Cigarette manufacturers also long promoted the idea that the connection between cigarettes and health harms was tenuous, with one tobacco executive evensayingin 1969 that “doubt is our product”.“It’s a well-worn tactic,” said Frey.Industry collaborationCox kept corresponding with industry scientists about his new tool, all the while holding similar conversations with ChatGPT about causation in research. In May 2023, for instance, Cox posed questions about the causal claims in a recent landmark study linkinggas stove exposure to childhood asthma, the emails show.Later that month, Coxsent a slideshow to the ACC’s Becker and several other industry-related scientists. His reviewer, it showed, had identified issues with the recent gas stoves study, and another major assessment which linkedPM2.5 exposure to cardiovascular issues.This tool could “benefit authors, reviewers, reporters, media (if we make the summary reports good enough), and decision-makers and policymakers trying to evaluate studies and decide how trustworthy their methods and conclusions are”, Cox said.In a proposal sent days later, he added that it is “probably good enough to be commercially useful”.In July 2023, Cox presented his new tool to members of the Long-Range Research Initiative – which also funded his earlier work – including to representatives from Exxon.Ahead of the meeting, Cox sent the group a conversation he had with the reviewer, which used a 2020 paper demonstrating a causal link between PM2.5 and mortality as an example of the kind of conflation his tool could spot.Maldonado, the editor of Global Epidemiology, offered to give the tool a “friendly trial” at his journal.From an email Cox sent to the American Chemistry Council’s Becker in July 2023View image in fullscreenA document showing the conversation between Cox and ChatGPTSuch automated critical reasoning can help to thoroughly review, and potentially to improve, the scientific claims and scientific integrity of causal reasoning and presentation of evidence underlying many regulatory risk assessmentsAfter the meeting, Cox sent a two-part project proposal to the ACC. “Such automated critical reasoning can help to thoroughly review, and potentially to improve, the scientific claims and scientific integrity of causal reasoning and presentation of evidence underlying many regulatory risk assessments,” Cox said.For part one, an academic paper on the project which would be published in Maldonado’s Global Epidemiology, he asked for $75,000. For part two, a pilot testing the reviewer on submissions to the same journal, he asked for $80,000. In his response to questions from the Guardian, Cox confirmed the ACC’s funding but not a dollar amount.Cox published the “phase 1”paperabout his new AI reviewer in the journal Global Epidemiology in June 2024.He also appears to have secured $40,000 for Global Epidemiology to participate in the second phase, but the partnership “did not come to fruition” because too few authors were willing to participate, Cox told the Guardian. Maldonado did not respond to a request for comment.By April 2024, Cox told the ACC’s Becker in an email that his reviewer tool was “ready for a demo”, claiming its reviews are “already better than many human reviews, although not as on-point and insightful as the best human reviews”.But in an email last May to toxicologistTed Simon, Cox said “the real goal” of the tool was to enable it to do literature reviews, examining wide swaths of published information in a particular subject area. That month, ExxonMobil scientist Hua Qian ran a test of the tool.Now, Cox told the Guardian, the tool was being tested by researchers submitting work to the journal he edits, Risk Analysis, and other academic journals, including Decision Analysis. About 400 people have tested the tool so far.Itai Vardi, a manager at the Energy and Policy Institute, who shared the trove of emails with the Guardian, said the project could have disastrous consequences for academia, particularly epidemiology.“AI language models are not programmed, but built and trained,” he said, “and when in the hands and funding of this industry, can be dangerous as they will further erode public trust and understanding of this crucial science.”‘Sound science’Asked about critics’ concerns about the ACC’s funding for the project, Cox said: “People who are concerned about the use of sound science in areas where politics has dominated might understandably be concerned about the use of such tools.”But people should “favor the development” of the AI tool if they want to “apply sound science to improve our understanding of the world and how to act more effectively”, he said.“The fact that the ACC … are starting to step up to the challenge of designing AI to increase the objectivity, transparency, and trustworthiness of scientific research seems to me to be a great public benefit,” he said.But the ACC “cannot be trusted as a source of ‘objectivity, transparency, and trustworthiness of scientific research’,” said Frey, when that research is “aimed at understanding the human health harms caused by chemicals manufactured by their members”. And for him, Cox’s use of the term “sound science” also prompted concern.“‘Sound science’ is a term popularized by the tobacco industry as part of a campaign to create burdens of proof far beyond those required for policy decisions,” Frey said. Indeed, in the 1990s, Philip Morris USA – for whom Cox has done research – ran a 10-year “sound science” public relations campaign tosow doubtabout the harm cigarettes cause.In an email to the Guardian, Cox noted that“reputable scientists” use the termto refer to reliable, verifiable research that follows accepted scientific methods. He dismissed the idea that causation can be difficult to prove in epidemiology.View image in fullscreenSome public health experts are alarmed about Cox’s AI tool.Photograph: Toshi Sasaki/Getty Images“My response to people who are concerned that we should treat evidence of repeated associations as if it were evidence of interventional causality is that this outdated style of thinking is tremendously harmful and counterproductive in designing effective measures to successfully protect human health and safety,” he said.Asked for examples of harmful policies created by overreliance on association, Cox named several scientific studies, including a1996 experimentwhich was stopped because interventions that were expected to slash participants’ chances of getting lung cancer “based on repeatedly observed associations” actually increased that risk.He did not name any policies.Other experts note that regulations and policies are not meant to require proof of causality – the Clean Air Act, for instance, says standards “allowing an adequate margin of safety … are requisite to protect the public health”.Cox, however, has critiqued proposals tostrengthencontrolsonpollutionon the grounds of imperfectly demonstrated causality. It is the sort of logic that Cox’s new AI tool could automate, which could benefit corporate interests, said Vardi of the Energy and Policy Institute.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

That is left for people to do.”Though Cox claims his AI tool is neutral, Finkel said his early ChatGPT conversations shed light on its potential dangers.“He was torturing the machine only along one set of preferences, which is: ‘Can I force you to admit that we are being too protective?’” Finkel said. “That’s not science.”Cox said his conversations with ChatGPT aimed to uncover hidden uncertainties. But a different chatbot could be trained to identify instances in which government is “under-regulating”, Finkel said.On an academic level, Cox’s interest in certainty might seem reasonable, but in the real world, it is dangerous to apply his standard of causality, said Finkel.“For almost anything that we now know is harmful, there was a period in time when we didn’t know that,” he said. If Cox’s standards are taken seriously, he added, we could see “generations, decades of misery while we wait for him to be satisfied”.This article was amended on 27 June 2025. An earlier version referred to the tobacco company “Philip Morris”; it was has been clarified that this is a reference to Philip Morris USA, rather than Philip Morris International; the latter became a separate company in 2008."

Sinner held three championship points for what would be one of the most monumental victories of his career.Just one of those three would have earned him a first grand slam title away from hard courts and redefined the terms of engagement with Alcaraz, the only player to beat him for 10 months. Sinner would then have drawn level with the Spaniard on four grand slam titles.What to watch out for at Wimbledon 2025: no line judges and more expensive strawberriesRead moreThe margins that determine success have always been precarious but few occasions exemplified this like Paris. Instead of Sinner reinforcing his status as the world’s best, Alcaraz produced another legendary moment in his young career withone of the greatest comebacks of all time. Although the Italian remains No 1 and the best player in the world based on his performances over the past year, on the eve of Wimbledon Alcaraz is the player to beat.Since Roland Garros, the momentum and good vibes surrounding the champion have only increased. He followed his three-day interlude in Ibiza bywinning at Queen’s Clubfor a second time. While he still considers clay his favourite surface, the 22-year-old’s grass record is astounding. He has amassed 29 wins and three defeats, winning 25 of his past 26 matches on the surface. He has more grass-court titles – four – than losses. He heads into Wimbledon as the clear favourite and will attempt to become the fifth man in the Open erato win the singles titlethree times in a row.It will take time for Sinner, who is nine months older, to come to terms with the French Open defeat, which was still playing on his mind when he lost in the second round of the Halle Open last week to Alexander Bublik. But another grand slam tournament also provides him with an opportunity to forge ahead with fresh motivation. Alcaraz and Sinner haveshared the past six grand slam titles, shutting out the rest of the field and until there is a significant shift, it is difficult to choose the rest of the field over these two players.Novak Djokovic, however, continues to relish the challenge of trying to disrupt the youngsters. At the age of 38 he has clearly been third-best player at the grand slams this year, reaching two semi-finals, with victories over Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev. On grass, where the seven-timeWimbledonchampion’s understanding of the surface is second to none and the faster conditions are more helpful to his ageing body, Wimbledon has always represented his biggest opportunity of becoming the oldest slam champion in the Open era.It is clear that Jack Draper will command the most attention at the beginning. The Briton’s past year has been remarkable, with the 23-year-old rising from No 40 to No 4,winning his first Masters 1000 titleat Indian Wells and reaching his first slam semi-final at the US Open. Draper has everything he could possibly want to make a deep run on the grass – a well-rounded, increasingly complete game and his destructive lefty serve and forehand are well-suited to the fast surface.View image in fullscreenJack Draper will command the majority of attention at the beginning of the tournament.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersWhile most British players have some sort of early breakthrough at Wimbledon, Draper, at 23, has never passed the second round and his success has come on foreign shores. He has never experienced the pressure and attention that comes with being a top home player and genuine contender on Centre Court. In the long run, Draper has the character and single-minded focus to handle these situations and produce his best tennis but the coming week will be a fascinating test of his character and current readiness for these moments.The women’s draw is shrouded in even more uncertainty. Aryna Sabalenka has clearly established herself as the top player but, like Sinner, she arrives at Wimbledon with her ego bruised after her dramaticthree-set defeat to Coco Gauffin the French Open final.Her tactless comments after the defeat, and the backlash they generated, only made things even more difficult for her. The Belarusian remains the favourite to win a first Wimbledon title, where the grass aids her ultra-offensive shotmaking.‘It helped me be free’: Madison Keys on therapy, Donald Trump and her husband as coachRead moreBeyond Sabalenka, there is even less clarity. Gauff has solidified herself as a true championship player by winning her second slam in Paris. However, despite her breakthrough run coming at Wimbledon, when she reached the fourth round from qualifying on her slam debut as a 15-year-old, the American, now 21, has struggled to find her best on grass.Iga Swiatek’s difficulties on grass are similarly well established but, with every year, the former world No 1 does appear to grow more comfortable. After an extremely difficult period on court this year, she did leave Roland Garros with her head held high despite her dominance in Paris coming to an end after her semi-final loss to Sabalenka.As is often the case, contenders could come from anywhere. Five months on from her stunning triumph at the Australian Open, Madison Keys remains effective both on grass and at slams. Mirra Andreeva’s improved serve should make her even more dangerous this year.In a sport where the margins are so tight, and there are so many players capable of performing at a high level on their day, this Wimbledon may well be decided by whoever truly rises to the occasion when they most need to.Explore more on these topicsWimbledonCarlos AlcarazJannik SinnerAryna SabalenkaIga SwiatekTennisWimbledon 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

He is currently third.Wolff was openin his previous pursuit of Verstappenuntil the middle of last season when the Dutch driver committed to staying at Red Bull and Mercedes signed Kimi Antonelli on a multiyear deal. In Austria, Wolff insisted he did not want to hide any negotiations from his drivers.“What we are trying to do in the team is be transparent,” he said. “You can choose to hold things under wraps, or do what we’ve done in the last 20 years I’ve been here is putting it out there and saying this is the situation. These drivers are clever people and they talk to each other.“I’m saying it how it is and there’s no such thing as saying we are going to sign Max, because it’s so far away that it’s not realistic at that stage. So with George, we talk about everything.”Verstappen did not deny talks were taking place when asked. “I don’t think we need to talk about that,” he said. “I don’t know, do you want me to repeat what I said last year? I don’t know. It’s the same answer.”Last year when faced with the same questions at this race, Verstappen emphatically confirmed he would remain at Red Bull.His team have brought upgrades to the Red Bull Ring, hopeful they might improve his fortunes, but it was Russell who was quickest in first practice in Spielberg, while McLaren’sLando Norris, also boasting upgrades, topped the time sheets in the second session in what is something of a big weekend for the British driver.View image in fullscreenLando Norris topped the time sheets in the second session.Photograph: Gintare Karpaviciute/ReutersIntensely self-critical, Norris will have subjected himselfto no little soul-searchingin the two weeks since he climbed disconsolately from his stricken car at the Canadian Grand Prix after hitting his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He held his hands up immediately, his contrition clear even, asMcLarenhad already all but acknowledged it was a matter of when not if the two finally came together, given the team’s stance on allowing their drivers to race one another. Yet for McLaren there has been no panic and certainly no sudden imposition of restrictions curtailing their drivers’ freedom to compete. Having dealt with it, it is business as usual.For Norris, however, it represents a bruising reminder of quite what is at stake and the intensifying pressure on him to deliver if he is to retain his world championship ambitions.With 10 races gone he trails Piastri by 22 points and while it is far from an insurmountable gap with 14 meetings to go, of more concern is that the form is overwhelmingly with the Australian. Norris had begun as favourite and had taken victoryin the season openerin Australia, where Piastri made his only major mistake thus far, spinning off in sudden, treacherous rain in Melbourne. Since when and until Canada, the Australian enjoyed a run of eight consecutive top-three finishes including five wins.Norris’s performances in contrast have been peppered with minor errors and some more costly, including Canada and crashing out of qualifying in Saudi Arabia.“Lando himself will have to show his character to overcome this kind of episode,” said the team principal, Andrea Stella, and Austria is a chance for Norris to reset and reassert at a key moment for the 25-year-old.Explore more on these topicsMercedes GPMax VerstappenFormula OneMotor sportMcLarenLando NorrisRed BullnewsShareReuse this content"

There is a look in Alexia Putellas’s eye, a light. “You know that feeling, that sense of security when it’s like you’re capable of anything?” the double Ballon d’Or winner says, leaning forward on a sofa at Spain’s Las Rozas HQ.“At that moment, I felt it. And now I’ve got that feeling once again. I’m happy; the desire for these Euros is huge. I can’t wait to start, to go and give my everything.” And Alexia Putellas’s everything iseverything.These are her third Euros – she scored a 94th-minute winner against England on competitive debut in 2013, aged 19, although she does not remember ifshe was given the goal– an indicator of how far she has come. Not only since 2013 but since the last time too. Switzerland stands as a kind of redemption, a reclaiming of her place after an English summer, and so much more, was taken from herby a torn cruciatesuffered at Bisham Abbey a day before Euro 22 began.It was, she says, anhostia, the worst of blows. “I had felt really good, and then … I knew the moment it happened. I heard a sound like a branch breaking. ‘No, not now.’ You never expect it, but at that moment. It’s the day before.”Putellas had arrived asthe world’s bestplayer, thetournament’s greatest icon, but when theselecciónkicked off in Milton Keynes she sat by the touchline in a baseball cap and Virginia Torrecilla’s shirt,crutches at her side. Two hundred and ninety-nine days would pass until she played again. Two years passed, two more operations – a World Cup, two league titles and a Champions League, attention and affection turned elsewhere – before Putellas was Putellas again, not just physically but emotionally. “People don’t know that with injuries you train more than when you’re healthy but you don’t get the reward of playing,” she says.“I’m competitive and you set yourself challenges: ‘When can I start walking?’ ‘A month.’ ‘OK, in three weeks, I’ll be there.’ But at first there’s nothing. Just pain. And I felt a lotof pain. I couldn’t sleep. I didn’t have any appetite. It was a vicious circle. To even move, you have to …”View image in fullscreenBarcelona’s Alexia Putellas lifts the Women’s Champions League trophy. ‘There’s a moment I feel liberated and that’s Bilbao.’Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersPutellas hauls her leg on to the sofa, a demonstration of the dead weight. “Post-op I had a very bad time,” she says, and it is not as if what followed was much easier either. “You go from playing at a stratospheric level to not being able to walk, not knowing how, learning aged 27, 28.“You get to the gym, which is at least your habitat. Then the pitch, where you think you’re progressing but frustration comes because your last memory playing was like that and now you can’t play a pass, can’t turn, can’t control. There are times you wonder [if you ever will].”“They warn you that the day you get the medical all-clear, play again, it’s still not done: you need time, adaptation, competition. Don’t think you’ll be the same; that’s just not real. You still have three, six months. You have to try to give yourself that margin, control your emotions. And right in the middle of that period is a World Cup.”Putellas returned in late April 2023, after 10 months out. But given the final minute of the Champions League final, reward after her rehabilitation, she arrived at the World Cup having made six appearances, all as a substitute, and those warnings are not always easy to hear. “You don’t go thinking: ‘I’m in that three-to-six month period’; you go thinking: ‘I’ll give my best.’“Two years later, I see it: my level is completely different, even if at the time you don’t realise. You’re not the same physically as before. There are things going on, too. I arrived feeling confident; then came[defeat to] Japanand I was the head cut.”Did she feel singled out? “No, not singled out. I understand that if things aren’t working the coach has to change someone and it was me, and that’s that.”That wasn’t that, however. Putellas played an hour in the semi-final and a minute in the final.Spain’s historic win, secured by a squad including only three of 15 players who had pulled outdemanding improvements, was overshadowed by the Spain federation’s president LuisRubiales’s unsolicited kissof Jenni Hermoso.Again,Putellas took the lead, which was not to say it was welcome, rather that responsibility demanded it. “I wish it hadn’t happened,” she says. “You try to tell yourself: ‘It’s great, we’ve just won the World Cup,’ but you see the press, people, everything, and the focus isn’t there. It was a shit situation, unpleasant, a burden.”View image in fullscreenAlexia Putellas holds the Women’s World Cup trophy alongside Jennifer Hermoso and Irene Paredes.Photograph: Pablo GarcíaIn November Putellas underwent another operation, this time on hermeniscus, a common consequence of cruciate tears. She missed 21 matches through to March, the doubts increasing, people saying her moment had passed, that she wouldn’t ever be the same.“I’m not going to lie: it gets to you,” she says. “There are those close to you going through it, suffering, thinking you won’t make it. I understand because the reality is there are cases where players don’t get back, and it’s not personal. [But] people don’t know.”In part that goes with being Putellas: the world’s best player, a footballer of huge symbolic significance, subjected to an exposure unimaginable before. A leader in the fight for professionalisation. A Ballon d’Or winner too, The Queen. “It’s been hard for me to come to understand that,” she says. “I see football collectively, everybody equal. At first, it was difficult to manage the attention. I was very introverted. And when the individual awards started arriving it was like: ‘I don’t understand this’. With time, I came to feel: ‘Well, they’ve put you there, fate wanted you there: use it.’ A lot of what I did wasn’t for me, but to make the game grow.“Take the Prime documentary: I didn’t want to do it. I said no four times. I watch a lot of sports documentaries and one day I was looking for one about a sportswoman. I only found Carolina Marín, the badminton player. That was the click. And I said: ‘Do it’.”Did you like it? Putellas smiles. “They might kill me for this, but I haven’t seen it. I mean, I saw it, but before it was finished. I know how I am. I don’t have the ego to watch myself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A friend said: ‘I don’t know how you do it but they either love you or hate you.’ I try not to focus on either.”Well, most of the time, motivation found in those who doubted she would return. “To tell the truth, that was also fuel, petrol. A challenge,” Putellas says. “Like: ‘You’ll see.’” Oh, they see.View image in fullscreenAlexia Putellas expects a ‘hard, hard’ Euros for Spain.Photograph undefined: Pablo GarcíaPutellas arrives at the Euros as one of the continent’s outstanding players, scorer of 22 goals last season and provider of 17 assists, directly involved in a goal (score, assist) every 44 minutes for Barcelona. Voted player of the season in Liga F, she has created more chances than anyone in Europe’s top five leagues. AS summed it up: “The best Alexia is back, or maybe even better.”When she returned to a struggling Spain side in February, six months later, she led a hammering of Portugal, a glorious roulette drawing a standing ovation from Vigo’s Balaídos stadium. Defeat to Arsenalin the Champions League finalhurt – it still does – but en routeshe had scored or assisted against every European opponent. It has been coming a year since the previous season’s final, a refound consistency positioning her as a Ballon d’Or candidate again at 31. “There’s a moment I feel liberated and that’s Bilbao,” she says.With five minutes remaining in the 2024 Champions League final against Lyon, she was sent on to protect a one-goal lead; instead she scored the goalthat secured the title. Barcelona were European champions again and she was bowing before fans, 697 days after her cruciate tore.“Physically you can be good, but if mentally you’re not there, you’re tense, you can’t control yourself as you did. It’s not that I came off the pitch that day thinking: ‘I can do it,’ so much as: ‘That’s it,’ ‘time’s come.’ The cruciate, the meniscus, the whole injury: you’ve closed that cycle. Done. I felt free. And from there, I’ve felt super good.”So here she is, 12 years on from her first Euros, three from what should have been her last, a legacy already left and more to leave. She gestures towards the end of the corridor, to the dressing room. Their dressing room now, their own place. Small details, she says, but ones that matter.“I remember the first time [in 2013] perfectly. There’s a goal that hit my pony tail and we won 3-2,” Putellas recalls. “I picture myself as a girl, I hardly knew where I was. Everything has grown. I’ve developed as a woman too. That day, I would never have imagined how things are now, for me or women’s football.“That was a moment of transition, and I lived both eras. However much I wanted to be a footballer, if everything isn’t [in place], you won’t be; you couldn’t plan this career. I like this sport so much I’m enjoying it being professional. It’s nothing like then. It’s a joy now here; I hadn’t lived this, ever.”“I think these Euros will be unique. It’s the trophy we’re missing, and we feel it could be now, but we’re facing very good teams and we know it’s a hard, hard journey,” Putellas says.“The cruciate was one day before it started last time, which was very tough to take. And on top of that just when I had felt really good, too. It’s been a long time, and people really have no idea what you go through but this year I have that feeling again. The challenge for me now is to keep going or even get better in these Euros. I just want to play football.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Euro 2025Spain women's football teamWomen's footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

She also predicted that new technology was coming that would also help Britain’s Keely Hodgkinson break the women’s 800m world record of 1min 53.28sec, which has stood since 1983.“Absolutely there will be a woman running a mile in under four minutes,” she said. “And I think it will take less than 10 years. And if it doesn’t come my way, it will be someone else doing it.”Asked why she was so confident, given the gap was still more than six seconds, she replied: “Going forward, the technology will be even higher than what I was using yesterday. So I think one day, one time, it will happen.”Kipyegon admitted that she had struggled in the final 200m, having heard the bell in 3:01. But she insisted she would not have changed anything about her attempt.“Birds sometimes fall but they fly again,” she said. “I believe I will still lower the world record of 4.07. I want to get it very close to the four minutes mark. And I believe I can still run under 4.05 in a race with female pacemakers.”Kipyegon’s next race will be over 1500m at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon, next week, and she insists she is in shape to challenge her world record of 3:49.04. However she said there are no plans yet to have another crack at the four-minute mile barrier.In Paris she spoke to Hodgkinson, who told her she is hungry to go faster once she has recovered from a hamstring injury. “I talked with Keely yesterday about everything,” said Kipyegon. “And my run was a huge inspiration for her. She’s hungry to go under 1.54 in the 800m. And I think Keely Hodgkinson one day, one time, will run under 1.53. She is so fast.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Sunday against Costa Rica, they face their biggest test yetJon ArnoldFri 27 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 19.48 EDTShareFor as much as the Gold Cup gets denigrated, it’s a much tougher tournament than it might appear. The ongoing tournament is the 11th edition in the last two decades, and this year’s US are just the 10th team to make it through three group matches unscathed (Panama became the 11th on Tuesday).US manager Mauricio Pochettino has to be pleased with his team’s performance. After rough showings in the pre-tournament friendly matches, a 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago was cathartic, while a 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia and a 2-1 victory against Haiti also showed that the US are trying to make winning a habit as their manager has asked.If Pochettino took lessons from those exhibitions and applied them to the tournament, it stands to reason that he’ll take the learnings from the group stage and put them toward what the US hopes will be three knockout contests.Here are four things we learned from the USMNT in the group stage:‘Gold standard’: training centre could be gamechanger for football in USRead moreThere is life without Christian PulisicThe days ahead of the tournament began were filled with worry about the fact that Christian Pulisic would not be part of the competition, opting for summer rest rather than trying to win what would be his first career Gold Cup title (a decision that caused no shortage ofdramaanddiscourse).There is no doubt the US would be a better team with Pulisic, and when he wants to come back into the team, he’ll likely go straight back into the XI barring a real showdown with manager Mauricio Pochettino. But in the group stage, the US has shown that it has players in the pool who can provide an attacking spark.Malik Tillman is most notable among them, scoring three goals in the group stage including a pair against Trinidad and Tobago and the opener against Haiti. Consistently dangerous and also hard-working, Tillman has been the breakout star of the tournament, putting the form he has often displayed with PSV on the field with the national team.“What a player, no? What a player that is showing in this camp his talent and (ability),” Pochettino said.Indeed. It’s not just Tillman, a Bayern Munich product who reportedly is drawing interest for a Bundesliga return, who is bolstering the US. Diego Luna continues to inject energy and try to create chances when he’s on the field, and Quinn Sullivan certainly isn’t afraid to try a few things – notably going for a rabona against Haiti but also putting a number of shots on target and linking up well with Tillman and the other attackers when he’s on the field.How the US men’s national team values diversity, even in the Trump eraRead moreCompetition is alive and wellWhile Zack Steffen and Patrick Schulte had to pull out with injuries, Pochettino’s top two goalkeepers remained in camp and look to be in open competition for the starting spot going forward. Or maybe the newer of those faces, NYCFC shot-stopper Matt Freese, is ahead for now.Freese started the first friendly of the summer against Turkey, while previous US No 1 Matt Turner played the friendly match against Switzerland that saw the Americans concede four goals in the first half.While it seems the competition is somewhat cut-throat, Pochettino laughed off the idea that Freese conceding on an error against Haiti would lead to some sort of conversation between the manager and the goalkeeper.“Remember, the most important action is the next one. If you’re thinking about the last one, you’re dead. You’re going to make another mistake,” Pochettino said. “This type of accident happens and it’ll happen in the future, but we’re so happy with him and the quality of our keepers, of course, the way they’re supporting each other.”For his part, Freese said he immediately put the error out of his mind and focused on not allowing another goal. “You have to move on very quickly, so, thankfully, the guys we all support each other in the bad moments and in the good moments,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWe’ll see where the coaching staff’s thoughts are when the starting lineup comes out against Costa Rica, a team with no goalkeeping battle thanks to anchor Keylor Navas.View image in fullscreenPatrick Agyemang has started up top for the US, scoring twice in the group stage.Photograph: Brian McLean/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockInjury returns are neededThe US came into the summer hoping they would enjoy the returns of right back Sergiño Dest, left back Antonee Robinson and striker Folarin Balogun. Instead, all three are missing the tournament because of injuries.Though striker Patrick Agyemang has scored twice in the group stage, the balance of his play has yet to convince that he’s polished enough at this point in his career to be a consistent option up top. The US needs Balogun and Ricardo Pepi fit and ready to go at the 2026 World Cup. Otherwise, the may find themselves in a situation like 2022, with no great goal-scoring options in a knockout game.A similar dynamic exists among the wide defenders. While Alex Freeman has been a pleasant surprise as a serviceable option at right back, both of Robinson’s replacements – Max Arften and John Tolkin – have had a few adventures, and it’s clear Robinson is the best American left back by a wide margin.The US could still win this thingWhile the US has looked great through three group games, their chief Concacaf rivals haven’t.Mexico managed just a draw with Costa Rica, and while they still have far more of their key contributors than the US does, they’ve struggled to score from open play, even struggling a bit against the Dominican Republic in the opener. Their Gold Cup has seen them relying on set pieces and a defense that is stingy with center back Johan Vázquez back and partnering César Montes once again, allowing Edson Álvarez to break things up in midfield. Canada struggled, and eventually drew, with Curaçao.The US will have no such margin for error now. It wouldn’t be out of the question for a team with as much experience and talent as Costa Rica to relish being a stumbling block on the US’s road to redemption after the last-place Nations League Final Four finish and the miserable friendlies. A great day from Navas (and perhaps a goal from Alonso Martínez) are both within the realm of possibility.It was a strong start, but the finish will matter much more, not just for this Gold Cup, but for momentum heading into the big show next year.Explore more on these topicsUSAUS sportsGold Cup 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

The home Euros had swung the nation behind the team and women’s football has not looked back. What did the day of the final look like? Ahead of the Lionesses beginning their title defence, this is the inside story of English women’s football’s greatest day.Waking up on the morning of the final, there was an eerie air of calm and confidence in the England camp.Lucy Bronze, right-back:We stayed at The Lodge, at Tottenham’s training ground. It was the only night we moved hotels. The blinds were automatic and they opened on the hour, every hour, from one o’clock in the morning. So everyone came to breakfast with bags under their eyes and we were like: “Oh my God.” It wasn’t a great start. Fran Kirby was furious. She was so tired because she hadn’t had a good night’s sleep. I distinctly remember that.View image in fullscreenSport: Oral history of Euro 2022Composite: undefined/Guardian Design; Tom Jenkins/The Guardian; Lisi Niesner/Reuters; Daniela Porcelli/ShutterstockLeah Williamson, captain and defender:The blinds broke, opening and closing all night, and I’m thinking: “If we lose today it’s going to be because of the blinds.” And we were at Spurs, The Lodge, I had some feelings about that.Jorge Bronze, Lucy’s brother:We drove down the night before and stayed in Twickenham. I have a big soccer-mom-style van, so it was me, my wife, our at the time three-year-old and one-year-old, and my mum and dad. My one-year-old, Alzira, took her first steps. That was quite an exciting start. You’re already nervous but then you’ve had this fairly big child milestone in amongst it.Alex Greenwood, defender:If you’d have come into our camp in the morning, you’d have thought it was a day off. It was so relaxed, so chilled, you would not think we were about to play a Euro final. I’ve never felt a more confident team. I’ve never been around that before. It was quite special. Even when I went down to breakfast and I looked around the room, I was thinking: “We’re going to win today.” I could feel it. Not in an arrogant way at all, just in a really confident way.View image in fullscreenFans head along Olympic Way, between Wembley Park tube station and the stadium.Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty ImagesRobyn Cowen,BBC commentator:Waking up, I didn’t feel nervous, I felt really calm actually. I’d done a lot of work, so I felt prepared, which is not always the case, especially after becoming a parent, trying to find that time to do all the prep, but I felt calm and confident.Chloe Kelly, forward:I sent my family a message that said: “Let’s enjoy this special day, we don’t know how many of these moments we’ll get to spend together,” and I really remember messaging them saying: “Imagine we have anotherBobby Zamora moment, but it’s me.”Olympic Way was flooded with fans arriving at a sold-out Wembley,a record crowd for a European Championship final of87,192.Williamson:I was very, very emotional, I got a text from [former Arsenal and England player] Kelly Smith, we were driving to Wembley and the helicopter was following us. It was all very exciting. I’d been very excited for every game but I was nervous for the final. When Kelly sent me, that was what set me off.Deborah Dilworth,head of women’s football at the Football Supporters’ Association:It was the most magical day. Getting to the Wembley steps and feeling the atmosphere, wow. Not that anybody worried that there’d be the same situation as the year before [when fans without ticketsforced their way into the men’s Euros final] but it was so starkly different to feel the atmosphere, a beautiful buzz, as you went up to the stadium. There was just so much vibrancy and colour. It was like a bubbling excitement, not tension.View image in fullscreenFans inside Wembley stadium await kick-off.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianCowen:Around 1pm I arrived. I was in a Winnebago with our team, [BBC presenter] Gabby Logan, mystic Fara Williams [who had correctly predictedEngland’s semi-finalscoreline], Alex Scott, Ian Wright, Kelly Somers and then Rachel Brown-Finnis and a lot of the people who were looking after us, and it was weirdly calm. Rachel was your typical footballer – very superstitious. One of her superstitions was we would always have a pizza before the game, she had one before theSpain quarter-final, so she wanted one again.Lucy Bronze:I don’t remember much until the warm-up. I can’t even remember travelling to the game. I think, when we sat on the bus, we were just kind ofwitheach other.Jorge Bronze:We took the family and friends bus that was put on for us, an old-school doubledecker, and it was a ridiculously hot day. It had no air-con and we were stuck in traffic for hours on the way in. There was the option of going to a little pre-party but my stomach can’t take the nerves on a day like that so we were in the stadium while it was empty, before 4pm, right behind the dugouts. We’re all in with all the other friends and family. You always know who’s friends and families because they’re wearing shirts that are too tight, because they’re wearing one of their daughter’s actual worn shirts and we’re not as fit as the players.View image in fullscreenEngland warm up before the Euro 2022 final.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAkua Opong, a volunteerwith the Team London Ambassadorsprogramme:I spent much of the Euros at either King’s Cross or Piccadilly, helping fans with information to make their way across London to matches, but had an event clash as I was also volunteering at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. After finishing the shift I raced to find a television. I watched the final with a friend and it was chaotic. Everywhere was packed. We went from place to place looking for somewhere to watch it. We eventually ended up watching it in aWeatherspoon’s.Sophie Downey,writer and co-founder of Girls on the Ball:It was 10 years to the day that we’d been at Wembley for Team GB against Brazil, whereSteph Houghton scored to beat Brazilin front of 75,000 people at the Olympics. That was one of the real first catalysts for the growth of the game, the moment England woke up to the sport a little bit, and the game that triggeredGirls on the Ball, so to be there 10 years later was incredible. The difference was stark. There was such a buzz around the place.Just before the 5pm kick-off, news thatthe Germany forward Alex Popp had injured herself during the warm-up only furthered belief.Lucy Bronze:Sat in the changing room, the big talking point was thatPopp wasn’t playing. [Head coach] Sarina [Wiegman] came in and said: “Popp’s not even in the starting XI.” A huge part of our gameplan was how to stop her, but we were a bit like: “OK, it doesn’t really change much, we still have to play against good players.” That gave us a boost, though, knowing that one of the best players in the tournament wasn’t playing.Downey:It was England v Germany and anything could happen, but when we got the news that Popp was injured I had a feeling that maybe, maybe this might be England’s time.Dilworth:As the players came out for the anthem, I just thought, whatever happens, this is an iconic moment in women’s football and I hope the players enjoy it, but equally, the fans were massive in that tournament and deserve that moment just as much as the players. I thought: “This is it, this is ours, we’re going to win.”The hope and tension at kick-off were palpable.View image in fullscreenA packed and expectant Wembley stadium.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianCowen:Usually at Wembley, television commentators get a great view. For some reason, because it was a tournament, the broadcasters were shuffled around a bit and we were in a radio seat with a really bad view. That was my first “oh no” moment. This was a bit too low. We were also right in front of [BBC Radio] 5 Live, and because I’m very small, I have to stand up for 98% of games, but if I stood up here 5 Live couldn’t see. So I spent most of the match in a sort of half-squat position.In the first half, Germany were aggrieved that they were not awarded a penalty for handball in 25th minute when the ball appeared to strike Williamson’s raised arm.Williamson:I remember Rachel Daly shouting at me: “What’s the VAR check for?” I knew that it was going to be a close call. I still stand by the rules, it hit me on the top part of my arm, above my sleeve. Genuinely, after that, there’s only a couple of thoughts I remember, mainly that my c ousin was pregnant and I really hoped we wouldn’t go to penalties as I didn’t know if she was going to make it through that.Lina Magull’s79th‑minuteequaliser cancelled out Ella Toone’ssecond-half chip over Merle Frohmsand forcedthe final intoextra time.View image in fullscreenElla Toone chips Germany’s Merle Frohms to put England ahead.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Uefa/Getty ImagesJorge Bronze:I didn’t even feel nervous, because we were still on the right trajectory. We were pretty in control throughout I felt, like there was going to be a moment and it was coming. I had no fear of penalties coming. I was calm, which as a family member is not usually my experience. Normally I am sort of close to a mild heart attack watching Lucy play. But not at that final.Rachel O’Sullivan, co-founder of Girls on the Ball and a photographer at Wembley:I was sitting next to a German photographer. I don’t speak German, she didn’t speak English, but we were both living the opposite emotions. Every time Germany came forward, I was super stressed, and she was super excited, and vice versa. Even without really speaking, we knew what each of us were going through.Cowen:When it went to extra time, I was thinking: “OK, I know what’s going to happen here.” I started to draw out a penalty shootout grid. I’ve kept that page as a memento. I did feel that penalties was where it was headed; it was Germany, it would have been so “England” and there had not been a shootout in the tournament.In the 110th minute, England won a cornerand Chloe Kellyurged the crowd to makemore noise.Kelly:Using the home crowd for our advantage, I always do that if I can; gee up the fans a bit, and I tried in that moment to really get the crowd up and going.With penalties looming, Kelly pounced, turning in from close range and pandemonium ensued.View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly pokes in the winning goal for England.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianKhiara Keating,watching with her family from the stands,nowa member of the Euro 2025 squad:I could have cried. I was speechless. I looked at my mum and was like: “Has that actually just happened?” Then the whole stadium erupted and I thought: “Wow, we’re actually going to do it!”Kelly:My job is to be there for the drop-downs and to help get the keeper to stay in her goal, and as it dropped to me, I just thought: “Get this in!” Then I was just absolutely buzzing.Jorge Bronze:Lucy would claim an assist for Chloe’s goal. I think there was at least enough nudging around the box that Lucy’s presence caused some havoc for Chloe to then stick it in. We all basically started crying at that point.Dilworth:I hugged my dad and I was close to tears. I was just tingly at the fact we were moments away, it was a stunned feeling, of thinking about what this moment was in history for women. The greater meaning was bigger than the game.O’Sullivan:For these games, as a photographer, you never know which end to sit in is going to be the best end to be at to get the key goal. I was at the wrong end for the Chloe Kelly goal, but it didn’t matter. I was able to get much more of the crowd and much more the reaction. It was one of those games where it felt like things worked out the way they were supposed to work out.View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly rips her shirt off as she runs to celebrate the winner.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/APCowen:After Chloe Kelly scored, I was certain Germany weren’t coming back. It was just a masterclass by England to keep the ball in the corner. Players like Jill Scott in particular were absolutely brilliant and she had that iconic swearing moment [Her outburst went viral.Greenwood:I love how we kept the ball in the corner, I loved those bits of the game the most. After the goal, we were so good.Lucy Bronze:I was like: “Yeah, we’re England. We can see this game out. No problem at all.” I’ve not watched the game back, [but] I remember Chloe shouted at me at one point because she got a yellow card for taking her shirt off. Bear in mind, I played the whole game and she hadn’t, and she was like: “You’re going to have to waste time on the throw-in and get a yellow card because I can’t.” I was like: “You got a yellow card because you scored and I’m going to be the idiot getting a yellow card for wasting time?” I didn’t in the end, but I remember her saying: “You need to waste time for the team. I can’t do it.”The final whistle and trophy lift prompted an outpouring of emotionas well as reflectionhow far women’s football had come.View image in fullscreenAlessia Russo races away at the final whistle.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianWilliamson:Seeing everybody’s faces, I felt like I was on that pitch for ever. I’ve watched the game back every year but it’s an out-of-body experience. All we kept saying to each other was: “We did it.” That was the emotion. It was a thing to be done, and we did it.Jorge Bronze:The tournament felt like the first time in my experience where support for the women felt much more sincere, rather than: “Oh, aren’t the girls doing well?” There was a clear narrative shift, where actually winning the tournament became really important toeverybody. That felt like a moment in history. Meanwhile, my son, Freddie, sat with his iPad, headphones on, totally uninterested. He’d done well, it was a hot day, and my poor wife, Charis, had Alzira in a sling, roasting – not ideal. I remember then the prospect of being back on that sodding bus for another hour, but moods were elevated at that point.View image in fullscreenThe England captain Leah Williamson lifts the trophy at the presentation ceremony.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianCowen:I’m really proud that it’s my voice on the commentary of it but, because I was so focused on getting it right, I did slightly miss out on the “going berserk”, because it was more of a relief that I hadn’t said anything mad. At the end, I turned to throw to Rachel [Brown-Finnis] for some words and she was just crying. It was a lovely moment, because she, like all the ex-Lionesses, is so supportive and I’m in awe of them; how none of them are bitter that they didn’t have these advantages, the pay players get nowadays, in their time. Instead they’re just so humble and just so proud to have played for England, so I was so pleased for her, in particular.View image in fullscreenRevelling in the moment: (from left) Lauren Hemp, Lucy Bronze, Nikita Parris and Demi Stokes.Photograph: Lynne Cameron/The FA/Getty ImagesDowney:I was just a wreck. I was sitting next to a journalist from the men’s game who I think had come in thinking it was just an average day at the office but by the end, as I was sobbing into my hands next to him, he went: “Enjoy this moment, they don’t happen very often,” and he really understood the gravity of it and how much it meant to those of us who have been plugging away in the game for a very long time. Then you have to then go and work, which I found really hard and odd. I had to put the game face on again to do thequotes piece for the Guardian. So I went and sat in Sarina’s press conference and that was absolutely crazy because the players came in, Mary Earps got up on the desk and danced and the players were all singing. Very, very special memories.View image in fullscreenLucy Bronze (left) and Mary Earps dance on the press conference table.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Uefa/Getty ImagesGreenwood:The moment the final whistle went, it was like an out-of-body experience. When I recall that game, I think about nothing but the final whistle and that pure relief. I don’t know whether I ran forwards, backwards, maybe I went to Leah first. I have no idea. All I know is it was one of the best moments of my entire life. The stadium sounded incredible.Celebrations on the nightspilled into Trafalgar Square the following day.Kelly:It was nice to spend time with every family, it was such a special night. The girls created special memories. To do it on home soil was incredible, having all my family in the stands. All my brothers, my sister, my little nephews, my nan, my mum and dad, my now husband Scott, were all there.Cowen:Back in the Winnebago, it was total euphoria. Fara Williams had somehow managed to procure a bottle of prosecco from somewhere, and she popped the cork inside a very small Winnebago, which probably wasn’t the safest thing. We put on music and danced around for a little bit, before going for some food and a bit to drink, but I had a child at home. In hindsight, I shouldn’t have gone home so early, but even in the moment, I thought: “I want to go home to see my family.” And then, for my sins, I do love a KFC, I only treat myself to one when it’s a really good game and I thought: “Robyn, you deserve it,” so I had chicken and chips around midnight.View image in fullscreenThe victorious England team take to the stage at Trafalgar Square.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianJorge Bronze:We went into the hotel and waited for the players to arrive and there were crowds of people at the hotel.

I remember leaving the parade thinking: “I don’t even know what I’ve just witnessed.” Every single one of those women who won the Euros have given so much back to communities.

I’ve got a lot of belief with this team. They’re so exciting to watch. They play without any inhibitions.

Whether that can translate to England’s senior side remains the big question after his six-match spell as interim manager. The Football Association has signed him up to take charge of the next under-21s tournament, in Albania and Serbia in 2027.Most of this squad will not be eligible, but Carsley knows that another European title would do his prospects no harm, havingmade clear his ambitionto one day take the senior job again. Thomas Tuchel, the incumbent, and his Germany counterpart and compatriot, Julian Nagelsmann, who is interrupting his holiday in Mallorca to attend, will be part of a sold-out crowd in Bratislava for Saturday’s final.An awkward moment was skilfully manoeuvred by Carsley when a Slovakian journalist asked which team Tuchel would be supporting. “Well, I imagine he will support England with him being the England head coach,” he responded.England’s captain, James McAtee, who is expected to leave Manchester City this summer, acknowledged it will be big chance for the players to shine. “I think it will be extra motivation for the lads to win,” said McAtee, who was gushing when asked about Carsley’s influence. “I think the biggest thing about working with Lee is the belief and the trust that he puts in you. On the pitch he just fills you with confidence. You know that you can go and play with freedom.”England’s players have been allowed to explore the Slovakian capital during their free time this week and Carsley will hope they have recovered sufficiently from five games in the past fortnight. It will be the third time England have faced German opposition in the final of theEuropean Under-21 Championship, having beaten West Germany to win their first title in 1982 under Dave Sexton, who won it again two years later, then been thumped 4-0 in 2009 under Stuart Pearce by a team featuring Manuel Neuer, Mats Hummels, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Grzegorz Wajda/ZUMA/AlamyCoach Nina Patalon has taken an improving Poland to a first major tournament and Ewa Pajor will lead the way in SwitzerlandByJoanna WiśniowskaFri 27 Jun 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 19.33 EDTShareThis article is part of theGuardian’sEuro 2025 Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 16 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two teams each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 2 July.OverviewOne of the enduring images from the win against Austria that sealed Poland’s first major tournament appearance was Oliwia Woś standing there with an enormous grin on her face. There were lots of smiles that day last December but tears of happiness, too, Ewa Pajor among those who cried at their achievement.The coach, Nina Patalon, has played a big part in the success. Against Austria they were the underdogs but showed better attitude over the two legs and, as always, came well prepared. Poland have made huge progress under Patalon. One of the coach’s mantras is that the true reflection of a team is how its members support each other.Watch Poland and you will see a squad fighting for every ball, and here the defensive midfielder Ada Achcińska, for whom there are no lost balls, leads the way. Another midfielder, Tanja Pawollek, reads the game superbly and her spatial awareness is another key component. Paulina Dudek and Oliwia Woś also have important roles, launching counterattacks with incisive passing.Two fast wingers, Ewelina Kamczyk and Natalia Padilla Bidas, will be ready to pounce on through balls but also drop deep to pick up the ball, together with the star of the show, Pajor. There was a trend in recent games for players to take more opportunities to shoot from range.One major disappointment for the players is not having special jerseys for the tournament. “We were hoping for a tournament-specific kit, that’s standard for a major tournament,” said the West Ham goalkeeper Kinga Szemik. “It’s part of the prestige of having qualified. All the others have a special jersey made so why are we treated differently?”PolandThe coachAlways the first.Nina Patalonis the first woman to coach a Poland senior team. Before that, she was the first Polish woman to get a Uefa Pro licence. And she is the first to take the women’s team to a major tournament. She moved up the coaching ladder by taking charge of the under-15, under-17 and under-19 teams. In addition to her current role she is the coordinator of women’s football training at the Polish FA. She believes football will become the No 1 sport for women in Poland, and if ever her motivation drops, she stops by a pitch where young girls are playing. That provides the energy to carry on, more than any Champions League game ever could.Star playerEwa Pajor.“One of her greatest assets is how much she enjoys playing football,” Patalon says of the Barcelona forward. “On the pitch she’s like a little girl: she forgets that she’s a great footballer.” The 28-year-old made her Poland debut 11 years ago and has more than a 100 caps. Last summer she moved from Wolfsburg to Barcelona. Spanish media loved the signing, El País writing that the forward was the missing piece in the jigsaw. Pajor moved to Catalonia to win the Champions League but lost in the final for a fifth time. Overall, though, the season was a huge success. She won the league and the Spanish Cup and was top scorer. Pajor has netted 43 times this season, leading to speculation about the Ballon d’Or.View image in fullscreenEwa Pajor controls the ball during the Nations League match against Romania in June.Photograph: Mateusz Słodkowski/Getty ImagesOne to watchEwelina Kamczyk.A volcano of energy everywhere she goes. At times it feels like she is the first person to attack and the first person to defend and win back possession. The 29-year-old, who plays for Fleury 91 in France, is the full package: she can dribble, shoot from distance and, overall, brings a lot of positive energy. An added bonus is her understanding with Pajor. They have been playing together for Poland for a long time, winning the Under-17 European Championship in 2013.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He described himself as humbled and honoured to get the job. “It’s an opportunity I feel I’m very capable of doing and ready to do,”he said.Andrews said he intended to play “dynamic, relentless” but organised football and that it was a “massive advantage” to know the squad: “I’ve got a really good connection with the players. The ceiling is massive in terms of what we can achieve and I’ve got so much belief in them.”Brentford continued to punch above their weight by finishing 10th in the Premier League in May and havesigned the goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleherfrom Liverpool.

A 3-0 home defeat by Newcastle on 7 April made Leicester the first side in the top four tiers of English football to lose eight successive home league games without scoring and Van Nistelrooy the second Premier League manager after Daniel Farke, then with Norwich, to lose eight home games in a row in the competition.The 48-year-old took charge at the club, who finished 18th, less than a month after leaving his job as an assistant at Manchester United, where he had a successful caretaker spell after Erik ten Hag’s dismissal that featured two wins over Leicester. He waspreviously the manager of PSV.He secured five wins for Leicester, one in the FA Cup against QPR and two against already relegated Southampton and Ipswich after his team had also been consigned to the Championship.Van Nistelrooy’s assistant Brian Barry-Murphy has gone to Cardiff as head coach and another assistant, Jelle ten Rouwelaar, the goalkeeper coach, is expected to join Brighton.

The midfielder took his chance when he broke through at the 2022 World Cup, earning a starting role for Argentina after coming off the bench to score a vital goal against Mexico in the second group game.Fernández looked as if he had been in the team for years by the time Argentina beat France on penalties in the final. He was named young player of the tournament and inevitably became a target for several big clubs. It was not long before word was filtering out of Portugal thatChelseaand Liverpool were looking at signing the former River Plate midfielder in the January 2023 transfer window.Transfers, Van Nistelrooy leaves Leicester, Euro 2025 and Euro U-21 final: football – liveRead moreChelsea’s fear was that Arsenal and Manchester City were planning to move for Fernández in the summer. Unwilling to miss out on a key target, the decision was made to pay above the going rate. Expectations rocketed when Fernández joined for £106.7m, breaking the British transfer record. He walked into a troubled club. Seasoned players wanted out, Graham Potter was close to being sacked and there was a lot of pressure on Fernández because of his fee, even though he had moved to a new league halfway through season and had made only 25 starts for Benfica.Mauricio Pochettino, who replaced Potter in the summer of 2023, often talked about Fernández’s journey moving too quickly. He was sympathetic in relation to his compatriot’s workload and wanted him to improve his physique. Fernández produced flashes of quality but his partnership with Moisés Caicedo often malfunctioned. Soon there were suggestions that Chelsea were better without Fernández, who missed the end of the 2023-24 season after a hernia operation.Yet Benfica will encounter a much tougher version of Fernández when they play Chelsea in the last 16 of theClub World Cupon Saturday. The 24-year-old is in excellent shape before facing his former side for the first time. Fernández emerged as a leader last season and has added a new edge to his game, flourishing since Enzo Maresca adjusted his role, pushing him forward and challenging him to score more.There was a point when it seemed Fernández was being eased out because of the emergence of Roméo Lavia as a deep-lying partner for Caicedo. There were whispers that the Argentinian world champion was in danger of becoming a very expensive reserve. Nobody questioned Maresca when he put Fernández on the bench against Liverpool last October and started without him in four consecutive league games. The statistics suggested it was the right decision. Fernández had scored seven goals since joining Chelsea, his tackle success rate was 39%, his passing had declined and he was not creating big chances.View image in fullscreenEnzo Fernández in action against Espérance in Chelsea’s Club World Cup group game.Photograph: Lee Smith/ReutersBut he responded. Fernández, named after the former Uruguay great Enzo Francescoli, set up Chelsea’s equaliser after coming on against Arsenal in early November. He returned to the starting lineup against Leicester and provided a goal and an assist. “I am trying to convince Enzo that attacking midfielders have to arrive in the box,” Maresca said.The Leicester game marked a shift. The assumption with Fernández when he joined was that he was a conductor; a direct replacement for Jorginho. Maresca sees it differently. If Fernández does not have the mobility to be a driving box-to-box midfielder and is wasted screening a defence, then ask him to do less. Contain his role and put him in the right areas.Playing higher, Fernández has turned into a box-crashing midfielder. No Chelsea player has more goal involvement in 2025 than his 14. Fernández has been their best player at the Club World Cup. He came off the bench to make a late run and score when Chelsea beat Los Angeles FC in their opening game. There was a reminder, too, of Fernández’s ability to pick a pass when he set up Liam Delap’s goal against Espérance. “He’s told me to run when he gets the ball,” Delap said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Eight of those 14 goal involvements have come against lowly Conference League opponents and in the Club World Cup. A headed winner against Tottenham in April and a smart finish to open the scoring against Liverpool last month offer evidence that Fernández can thrive in pressure moments. They were big goals in Chelsea’s push for Champions League qualification.Fernández is in a much better place than when he headed to the US for Chelsea’s pre-season tour last year. He was a disgraced figure back then, after being filmed taking part in a racist chant after Argentina’s triumph in the Copa América. Reintegrating him was a challenge. Maresca was criticised for making Fernández captain on the opening weekend of the season.Wounds have been healed, though. Fernández was forgiven after apologising to his teammates. The hope is that he has matured. Chelsea are a young team. Fernández is a competitor. He plays with a snarl. He does not shy away from confronting opponents.He has stepped up in recent months. Much of the focus after Chelsea fought back from 1-0 down to beat Real Betis in the Conference League final was on Cole Palmer’s second-half brilliance but it should not be forgotten that it was Fernández who ghosted into the box to score the equaliser. More of that and people will start talking about the new Frank Lampard.Explore more on these topicsChelseaUS sportsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And the game is against a side you’ve never heard of, part of some arcane tournament that’s suddenly of vital importance? Oh, and it’s being played in your parents’ back garden? Just us? Well, that’s the closest parallel we could think up for Copa Gianni, where the group stages have served up the weird, wonderful and woeful in equal measure. If you haven’t been paying attention, here are some “highlights” so far.Goals, goals, goals:Let’s be honest, if you’re a neutral tuning in on a weekday afternoon, or in the dead of night, you want to see goals – and Copa Gianni has certainly delivered. There have been148 in 48 games, a reliable ratio of more than three per game. We’ve seen seven-goal shootouts (Mamelodi 3-4 Dortmund, Juventus 2-5 Manchester City), an eight-goal epic (Porto 4-4 Al Ahly) and, er, a 10-goal classic (Bayern Munich 10-0 Auckland City). There’s been quality to match the quantity too, with highlights fromKenan Yildiz, Miguel Merentiel, Mamelodi’sLucas Ribeiro channeling 80s Brazilandof course, Lionel Messi. Attacking flair, dodgy playing surfaces and a relaxed attitude to defending have given the tournament a fun, knockabout pre-season feel that will please casual fans, and wound Gianni Infantino to his core. Everyone’s a winner!Brilliant Brazil:The notion that Copa Gianni and its many predecessors don’t really matter that much is a profoundly European point of view. South American sides have generally quite fancied the idea of being the world’s best team, even if in recent times it’s been the Euro giants picking up the trophy each year with a collective shrug. Might that change in the new, expanded format? Brazil’squartet of sides have been magnificent: all four are into the last 16, with one defeat in 12 games and just nine goals conceded collectively, rebuffing a few stereotypes about shapeless “samba football” on the way.View image in fullscreenRiver Plate fans bring the noise in Seattle.Photograph: Pablo Porciúncula/AFP/Getty ImagesCrowd confusion:South American teams have brought along thousands of noisy, passionate fans that have genuinely saved things from becoming a total embarrassment. There have been some big attendances – 60,927 people can tell their grandkids they saw Al Ahly 0-0 Inter Miami – but also some near-empty grounds. There were just 3,412 fans at Camping World Stadium in Orlando to see Mamelodi Sundowns defeat Ulsan HD, a sentence which sums up why CG ‘25 is simply not an elite-level tournament, no matter how much Infantino waves his gold key around.Extreme weather:The biggest crowd so far – 80,619 – was at the Rose Bowl to see PSG thump Atlético Madrid 4-0. The problem was that temperatures soared to 31C for a 12pm kick-off, with supportersclaiming they were told to dispose of full water bottlesbefore entering the venue. “There was no way to simply buy water,” sweated one, while another declared that attending was “the worst mistake”. The heat almost drove Diego Simeone to go full Jackie Charlton on the touchline, and it wasn’t just in Pasadena. Dortmund subs retreated to the dressing room to watch the end of their game, while the threat of storms caused five games to be delayed.The underdogs:Auckland City earned their place in the draw by winning Oceania’s Big Cup, but they are not even the best team in their home city. Auckland FC recently topped Australia’s flamin’ A-League table, but are ineligible for either AFC or OFC competitions. Instead, New Zealand’s finest amateur side jetted off to the USA USA USA – those who could get the time off work, anyway – and lost 10-0 to Bayern and 6-0 to Benfica. They restored pride with a very creditable 1-1 draw against Boca Juniors, but reports suggest the team want head coach and dentist Paul Posa to be replaced – in part because he had never heard ofBenfica’s World Cup-winning defender, Nicolás Otamendi. Other underdogs made a better impression: South Africa’s Mamelodi Sundowns were a goal from going through, Mexico’s Monterrey – led by Sergio Ramos – sent River Plate home, and plucky Saudi outfit Al-Hilal showed up Real Madrid. At Copa Gianni, dreams really do come true.QUOTE OF THE DAYIt helped playing with my brothers all the time … I went to Arsenal and trained at the boys’ academy.

According to reports in Spain, the fever failed to subside and so more extensive tests were carried out which confirmed she has viral meningitis, an inflammation of the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Viral meningitis is caused by an infection and is the more common version of the disease, as opposed to bacterial meningitis. According to the NHS, viral meningitis tends to get better on its own within seven to 10 days.Spain begin their Euro 2025 campaign in six days’ time, when they play Portugal on 3 July. They then play Belgium on 7 July and Italy on 11 July.Bonmatí wasnamed the winner of the Ballon d’Orfor a second consecutive time in October, receiving almost double the votes of closest rival for the award Caroline Graham Hansen. The technically gifted midfielder was critical to Spain’s Women’s World Cup triumph in 2023 and secured a sixth league title and fifth Supacopa de España this season, but was denied a fourth Champions League title by Arsenal’s 1-0 defeat of Barcelona in this year’s final.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After two days of wobbles, a portion of Australia’s batting got its act together, with the lower-middle-order trio of Travis Head, Beau Webster, and Alex Carey making half centuries to lift Australia’s second innings to 310. That left West Indies needing 301 to win the first Test in Barbados, always unlikely on a Kensington Oval pitch that already had balls keeping low. Josh Hazlewood made sure of it with a withering burst of 4-4 in 16 balls, later upping that to 5-23, as West Indies crashed humiliatingly to 141 all out, losing by 159 runs.Hazlewood has been the subject of some public attention of late, given his injury absences and how well Scott Boland has performed during each one. But the first-choice option has 288 Test wickets, took 35 of them at 13 last calendar year, and has nine at 18 in the two matches he has managed in 2025. His career against West Indies is worth 43 at 15, and over two tours to this part of the world he has 19 wickets at nine.Usman Khawaja refuses SEN interview after radio station’s sacking of journalistRead moreHis match-defining spell was built around his ability to keep putting the ball on exactly the right spot. After an unusually expensive first three overs went for 18, Hazlewood had a brief break and returned for the 11th. West Indies were going brightly at 47-1. Former captain Kraigg Brathwaite had flicked a catch from Mitchell Starc to square leg, but John Campbell and Keacy Carty were scoring freely. Facing a line around the wicket, the left-handed Campbell gave up a gift, a kneeling lap shot that lobbed to Carey behind the stumps.The very next ball, Hazlewood’s suffocating line got an inside edge onto pad from Brandon King, lobbing to slip, a golden duck to complete a grim debut for the man who dropped three catches in the first innings. The hat-trick didn’t follow, captain Roston Chase able to leave just outside off, but Hazlewood got him next over, more seam movement and another inside edge to short leg. Then even more jag an over later, and a touch of low bounce, as he knocked Carty’s stumps awry. He had four wickets for 23, West Indies were 65-6, and the match was all but done.Pat Cummins followed Hazlewood’s spell with another lawnmower delivery into Shai Hope’s stumps, but hope had already gone. Alzarri Joseph got a promotion after his late tonk in the first innings, but ran himself out with a slow response to a call from Justin Greaves, Marnus Labuschagne as a sub fielder hitting the stumps direct. Hazlewood returned from a brief break for his fifth thanks to Jomel Warrican, who survived an lbw thanks to umpire’s call then nicked the next, making it 86-8 as extra time began.View image in fullscreenTravis Head hits out during this innings of 61.Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesIt was a subsidence, but one in the expected direction after Australia’s score. In a match dominated by pace, Head and Webster were able to use it to their advantage, scoring almost entirely square of the wicket on the off side, left-hander and right-hander alternating cover drives and back-foot punches to opposite sides of the ground. West Indies frustration mounted as the partnership reached 102, and it took a devilish moment from the pitch to cut off Head for 61, lbw to a ball that almost went underground to hit his pad from around the wicket.That was the first of seven overs from Shamar Joseph either side of lunch, with the other end of his spell getting Webster nicking down the leg side on review for 63. Carey immediately hit the nitro, smacking Jayden Seales straight for four and six before pulling another four in the same over. A second six followed from Greaves, as the Australian keeper raised 50 in 40 balls.With Cummins having skied a catch, Joseph returned to bowl Starc off the inside edge. Fatigue was telling, with a rash of no-balls including a wide beamer, as the tail smacked a few runs. His next break lasted all of four overs, until Chase got Carey out smartly with a wide slow off break lashed to long off. With Joseph on four wickets as he had been in the first innings, he had one last chance to take five, and as at the Gabba 18 months ago, he finished an Australian innings by castling Hazlewood, this time off a flailed bottom edge. The bowler sank to his knees, pounding the pitch with one hand. In three Tests against Australia he has 22 wickets at 16.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not that Shamar Joseph would have expected to follow his five-for by having to go out and bat before the end of the day, with the umpires extending beyond the extra half hour because the required overs hadn’t been bowled.He let out some frustration, lashing 44 from 22 balls, and while aiming for a half-century in one blow, edged Nathan Lyon to slip. That left three balls in the day, and Lyon only needed one. In gathering Friday dusk, it was an hour and 13 minutes after the scheduled close when Seales was caught by Sam Konstas at bat-pad – a chastening end for West Indies, and a dramatic turnaround for Australia. West Indies authorities were desperate for this match to reach the weekend to get some crowds into the party stand. Instead, everyone will hit the beach.Explore more on these topicsAustralia cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

But coming after a four-year absence from first-class cricket, and just 18 overs with a red ball for Sussex this past week, the selection also raised eyebrows.England should be ‘careful’ and save Archer for third India Test, urges FarbraceRead moreAmong them were those of the Sussex head coach, Paul Farbrace, who fanciesEngland should stick with the XIthatsecured a 1-0 lead at Headingley. Key has hinted at this being a possibility, with Archer potentially lined up for the third Test at Lord’s. Either way, England’s managing director has stressed his schedule – a diet of Twenty20 and one-day international cricket these past 18 months – has been a conservative one.“I think we’ve gone slower than we could have done,” Key said on Friday, speaking at an event for the series sponsor, Rothesay. “Jofra has been in a long period where he’s been building up and building up [in white-ball cricket]. The temptation could have been to rush him back sooner. But actually we’ve gone down this road to make sure that we’re in this position now where we’re thinking about playing him.“He could be one of the best bowlers we have had. And you only do that by doing it in Test cricket. Hopefully for the next few years we’ll be fortunate enough to see Jofra have the chance to stake that claim.”Archer’s past injury problems relate to stress fractures in the lower back and elbow, with England ­getting too giddy when he first burst on to the scene in the World Cup and Ashes summer of 2019. The 42 overs he sent down on anabsurdly flat pitch in Mount Maunganuiagainst New Zealand the following winter was a prime example of this, with Key expecting Stokes to avoid the mistake made by his predecessor Joe Root.View image in fullscreenBen Stokes (right) knows how to handle an impact bowler like Jofra Archer, according to England managing director Rob Key.Photograph: ReutersKey said: “These are impact players. You don’t want them doing other roles. That’s where you need complementary skills, so you can share a bit more of the work. The temptation at times with Jofra is that he can do a bit of everything. But you’ve got to use him when he can impact the game and Ben is one of the best at that. You have got to be smart with how you use them so they can help you win a game.”A second round of midsummer County Championship matches starts this Sunday, three days before the second Test, and it may be that one or two seamers who are unlikely to feature at Edgbaston – Jamie Overton and Sam Cook missed out last week – are released to play on the third and fourth days of it, as per the regulations.If held back for Lord’s, Archer could in theory return to play the second half of the match between Sussex and Warwickshire at Hove. As the spare batter in the squad, Jacob Bethell will not be released for it, however, and will remain with England until the toss on Wednesday to provide cover for any late injuries or illness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although Draper has never passed the second round atWimbledon, he is capable of making his first deep run at the All England Club when the championships begin on Monday.Wimbledon hands Emma Raducanu tough draw after British teenager XuRead moreThe 23-year-old’s burgeoning profile – he shot a Burberry campaign with the model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in betweenwinning the Indian Wells titleand reaching the French Open quarter-finals this month – has diverted some of the focus on Raducanu since her breakout summer of 2021, when a run to the fourth round at Wimbledon while ranked 338 in the world was followed byvictory in the US Open.“It is amazing,” Raducanu said of Draper’s rise. “I’ve known him for so long, so many years, and when we were juniors, we were both pretty promising, and now to kind of be British No 1 on both men and women’s side and the real thing is, it’s pretty cool. So this Wimbledon, I’m sure, for him, will feel different, but he’s in a great place, and obviously with his seeding you know, hopefully it can help him.”Seeded fourth, Draper is in the other half of the draw from Jannik Sinner and can only face the reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-finals – but could play Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals.Raducanu, meanwhile, is now ranked 38 as she attempts to establish herself at the top of the game chasing players such as the world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, who knocked her outin the second round at Roland Garrosand to manage the back problem she has had since just before the French Open.View image in fullscreenJack Draper reached the semi-finals at Queen’s Club in 2025.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAThis year will mark the first Wimbledon without line judges, with the tournament adopting electronic line-calling. A total of 23 British players will compete in the men’s and women’s singles draw, including Katie Boulter, Sonay Kartal, Jacob Fearnley and Cameron Norrie – the most British main-draw entrants since 1984. Raducanu believes their friendly competition will push each other to greater heights.“You see them win their match so you want to win your match, and it’s that kind of healthy competition, because you don’t want to be the one left behind, you know? And I think that’s a good thing, and it’s not coming from any bad place,” said Raducanu.Raducanu has spent much of the past four years trying to adjust to her status as a major champion and all the scrutiny that comes with it. Her difficulties have included several encounters with a stalker during her tournaments in Asia last year, with a tearfulRaducanu hiding behind the umpire’s chairafter spotting the man during her match at the Dubai Open in February. The man, who has never been named publicly, signed a document agreeing to stay away from Raducanu. The All England Club subsequently removed the man from Wimbledon’s ticket waiting list.In general, however, Raducanu appears to be in a better place. She has found herself gravitating towards people she knew before her breakthrough results, including her current coach, Mark Petchey. In the past, Raducanu did not trust the people around her enough to be completely open and vulnerable.“It just felt like I couldn’t speak out really, because I didn’t want what I said to kind of be shared and spoken about and gossiped about, because you know how the Chinese whispers go. It’s just exaggerated and things are twisted. So I just prefer to keep everything in and that is not necessarily the best thing because when you’re on the court, you’re kind of playing, holding a lot in rather than being expressive, and that’s when I’m at my best,” said Raducanu.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionHaving been academically inclined in her youth, Raducanu recently found herself wanting to return to her studies. She has taken up a one-year art history course, a stark contrast to maths and economics, her chosen A-level subjects. In recent months, she has come to understand that she is a creative person and those qualities are key to her success on the court.‘It helped me be free’: Madison Keys on therapy, Donald Trump and her husband as coachRead more“It is something I’ve discovered recently,” she said. “I think I was growing up very kind of boxed into a way of thinking that, like maths and logic and like ABC, and then as I kind of went through it over the last few years and figured out what I actually enjoy. I think when I play my best, I’m very free. I’m enjoying it, I don’t have to be so serious and ‘on’ all the time, because sometimes on the court, if you’re laughing, it can be seen as unserious. But actually for me, it’s a better way, and I’m probably going to play better than if I’m just putting so much pressure on myself to be ‘on’ and perfect.”This year, Raducanu has made some positive progress, reestablishing herself inside the top 40 and putting herself in position to rise even further. Her susceptibility to injury, however, has continued to be a significant problem. After losing in the second round of Eastbourne on Wednesday, she also noted that she has been dealing with some undisclosed personal issues. Looking at the bigger picture, the goal is to simply ensure that she enjoys her time on and off the court.“Sometimes I want to go into the future and think: ‘Oh my God, am I going to regret not enjoying this moment?’” said Raducanu. “I’m 22 now, so I’m kind of living for that person to not have any regrets to look back on.”Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuJack DraperWimbledonTennisWimbledon 2025newsShareReuse this content"

It’s burrowed down real deep, beneath layers and layers of maximalist nonsense. But it’s in there somewhere, a good soccer tournament, cloaked by all the avarice and bombast, in spite of itself and those responsible for it.It’s true: the Club World Cup and its new summer format haven’t been all bad. The group stage, which concluded on Thursday, offered fun and competitive teams. It served up a few genuinely enthralling games, especially in the clashes between the European and South American sides. The fans of some teams – the indefatigable singing and chanting of Boca Juniors’ and River Plate’sbarras; the churning sea of red hopping up and down for the Urawa; the clapping and singing Wydad fans; the drumming and dancing Brazilians crisscrossing the nation in the wake of theirfour thriving clubs– injected the proceedings with exactly the kind of summer tournament folklore and fever you should hope for. We’ve even seen some kit design excellence –thank you, Botafogo.Brazilian teams have excelled at the Club World Cup. How far can they go?Read moreWe’ve gotten some Lionel Messi almost-heroics and then somecertified Messi heroics. We were given a vintage Luis Suárez goal, bullying the ball into the net. We saw the European champions Paris Saint-German savage Atlético Madrid 4-0, only to turn around and lose to one of those pesky Brazilian sides, Botafogo. Like many World Cups, there was a European giant that disappointed in not making it past the groups. This time, it was Atléti.While the Brazilian delegation offered up good teams and good fans, the Argentinian mission only sent good fans, bringing color and noise as both River and Boca were knocked out in the group stage and looked decidedly overwhelmed even by mediocre opposition.Meanwhile,Flamengo comprehensively beat 10-man Chelsea 3-1. Borussia Dortmund was held scoreless by Fluminense andalmost embarrassedby Mamelodi Sundowns, flirting with giving away a 4-1 lead. The only group not to yield compelling theater was G – which was dominated by Manchester City and Juventus (until City smashed Juve 5-2), at the cost of Al Ain and Wydad – since Group H saw Real Madrid stunned by a Al-Hilal in a 1-1 tie.After all the overcooked buildup and grandiose promises, the tournament’s openingfell flat, clouded over by therumors of Ice raids. That the urgency in the action arrived eventually should be credited to the non-European teams. They have been the primary suppliers of the fun.View image in fullscreenInter Miami’s Luis Suárez in action against Palmeiras.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersStill, all of these pleasing displays of soccer and the things that make it wonderful have materialized as a kind of act of defiance.

While 14 games have drawn over 50,000 fans, there have been no sellouts. The impact of good crowds wasdiminishedby Fifa’s insistence on playing in America’s biggest arenas. Another 14 games drew fewer than 20,000, suggesting using Major League Soccer facilities for a lot more games might have been a good idea.It was also a grind, with four games a day for most of the group stage, and requiring a finalist to slog through seven matches on the back of, or in the midst of, the punishing domestic club seasons. The timing is all wrong, confronting the players with the samecatastrophically hot weatherthat willbewitch next summer’s World Cup proper. There was Fifa’s cowardice in removing anti-racism signage, and thenbringing it back for a single day. For 63 games, we must suffer theludicrousspectacle of bored players ambling through the thin puffs of smoke and shimmering lights as an announcer gives them the full heavyweight-championship-of-the-world boxing match treatment during pre-game introductions. Also, whatever the hellthatwas in the Oval Office with Donald Trump, Fifa president Gianni Infantino, and the bewildered Juventus players and executives – hopefully a nadir in Infantino’s persistent cozying up to Trump.It’s a lot – probably too much – of everything. And in failing to meet its own impossible ambitions, the Club World Cup has made no imprint whatsoever on the culture.And yet the idea of the thing clearly isn’t the problem. There is a more modest, pared-down version of this competition that could be a success, with an emphasis on the competition rather than the revenue and the overplayed stakes. If it was brought along slowly and nurtured as a growth play, rather than announced as the biggest thing to ever happen right at the outset, there is an event there that could enrich the sport.

There were a lot of instances where I would say something and I was surprised that’s actually how I felt. Those are the kind of things that live in the back of your head you don’t ever really pay attention to.”She still talks to the same therapist and says: “One of the biggest things I’ve learned about myself is that, because of our sport, and our constant striving to be better, there’s always something else [to do]. Sometimes you don’t really take a moment to acknowledge how you feel or think about what’s going on inside. You just put your head down and keep going into the next thing. At some point that catches up with you and so it was really important for me to learn how to actually just sit and be introspective and figure out what I was feeling and why. And then just being OK with that and not immediately trying to fix it and make it go away.”View image in fullscreenMadison Keys on the Wimbledon practice courts. Last she had to retire with a torn hamstring after being 5-2 up, two points from victory, against Jasmine Paolini in the fourth round.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APThe best tennis players are so consumed by their careers, and life on tour, that it often seems as if their true selves, as people, are forgotten. Did Keys become better at separating her personal identity from her tennis-playing persona? “I was able to do it more, but there are times when it feels like you’ve figured it out and things are great only for you to find it’s not so simple.“The hardest part about focusing on your mental health is that you’ve never done it [completely]. It’s never box-checked off, so it’s something I’ll have to continue to be conscious of, because it’s easy to fall into bad habits.”Keys faced a difficult draw in Melbourne and had to win five three-set matches, beating four opponents in the top 10, including Iga Swiatek, world No 2 at the time,in an epic semi-final,and then the world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka. She survived a match point against Swiatek and was pushed to the brink by Sabalenka before winning 7-5 in the third set. “I was most proud of how I took every round just as that round,” Keys says. “I was so focused and never got ahead of myself. Playing all these hard matches against top players really allowed me to focus and keep persevering. The fact that I played so many three-setters and was able to hold the trophy at the end of the two weeks was amazing.”Eight years had passed since her only previous slam final when, at the 2017 US Open, she wascrushed 6-3, 6-0by her friend Sloane Stephens. The pressure of the occasion had been too much against Stephens and, in Melbourne, Keys said: “I’ve obviously thought of that match endlessly for the past eight years.” So, did her recent therapy help in those clutch moments of her first slam victory? “It helped me be a lot more free and have a clear mind in the moment,” Keys confirms. “I was able to force myself to be a little braver in those moments instead of being careful and tentative, and just go for it. It got to the point where a lot of the time you’d rather be brave. Maybe things don’t go exactly how you want but you did them on your terms and you feel you have no regrets, versus if you’re a little tentative or trying to be careful and it doesn’t work out. That’s when you really have regret.”That regret had also been felt acutely in the semi-finals of the 2023 US Open. Keys led Sabalenka 6-0, 5-3 but, rather than maintaining her positivity, she became passive and hesitant and lost the match on successive tie-breaks. “I don’t know if that was the exact moment, but obviously it was a tough loss,” Keys says of what prompted her to seek therapy. “Being in that position and not to be able to cross a line was definitely a kind of final reminder that: ‘Oh yes, maybe there’s something that we can work on.’”Keys also switched from using a Wilson racket to the larger Yonex and she tweaked her serve, but she admits that, apart from working on her mind, the most positive change in the past two years has been the appointment of her husband, Bjorn Fratangelo,as her coach.“I was struggling when I asked him to help me out,” Keys recalls of the June 2023 move. “At the time it was supposed to be short term but then we immediately had success. I think the biggest hurdle for him was being comfortable in telling me what to do. That took time to get used to but, now, we’re finding our stride.”Fratangelo was a player who briefly cracked the world top 100 in 2016, but what are his best attributes as a coach? “He’s really great at analysing what’s going on [in a match] and he does it so quickly. Coupled with the fact that we obviously know each other very well and know how to communicate, he’s able to see some things that I’m not seeing on the court. He then communicates in a way that I can actually do it.”Keys says that as a couple, away from the court, “we do a pretty good job of balancing things. When we’re home, we’re very much home and tennis is off. Home is home and work is work. Sometimes it’s harder to do than say but, for the most part, we’ve done a good job.”View image in fullscreenBjorn Fratangelo, Madison Keys’ husband and coach, watches over a training session at this year’s French Open.Photograph: Tim Clayton/Getty ImagesIn the French Open this month Keys looked on course for the semi-finals when she won the first set against Coco Gauff. But she crumbled in the third set of an error-strewn match and her fellow Americanwent on to beat Sabalenkain another dramatic final in Paris.“I was able to watch the last set,” Keys says, “and it’s so amazing for Coco. I thought I could have won our match but nearly beating someone doesn’t actually count.”Keys laughs and then says of Gauff: “She’s playing some great tennis and her clay season was phenomenal. It’s obviously disappointing to be so close and then lose to the eventual champion. But at the same time it gives you a lot of confidence.”Wimbledon is next and it is a tournament where she has reached two quarter-finals. In 2015 she beat Petra Kvitova and Venus Williams before losing to Serena Williams while, eight years later, she lost to Sabalenka in the quarters. Last year was even more painful when, in the fourth round, she was 5-2 up in the third set and two points from victory against Jasmine Paolini.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She retired at 5-5 and Paolini went on to make the final. “Hopefully this is the year I make it past the quarters because Wimbledon has always been something that I dreamed of. It has this aura which means that, I think, for all tennis players it’sthetournament.”View image in fullscreenMadison Keys in action against Petra Kvitova at Wimbledon in 2015.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt’s hard to believe that Keys,a teenage prodigy, has been playing professionally since she was 14. “I feel every one of those past 16 years,” she says with a groaning kind of laugh.Staying in Chelsea for a change, Keys reveals: “I wish I could say I’ll be doing some sightseeing but I’d be lying if I feel like that actually might happen. But it’s been nice to see a different part of London. I’m notorious for being stuck at Wimbledon all the years I’ve been here, so it’s fun just to be in another part of the city.”What would she most like to do in London? “When I’m in a big city I’ve always really loved doing that touristy bus thing where you can kind of see everything in one trip. If I have an afternoon off that would be the one thing I’d love to do – just hop on a bus and see all of the sights at least once.”Kindness Winsis the non-profit foundation she set up in 2020 and its very name offers insight into her character and philosophy of life. “It means a lot to me,” she says, “because tennis has brought so much into my life and it’s opened so many doors for me. I felt it was important to also give kids that opportunity because tennis teaches so many important life lessons. It helps kids learn those in a way where they can be competitive but also a good sport.“So I wanted to make sure that I did whatever I could to make tennis more accessible for as many people that wanted to play it.Tennisalso gives so many opportunities to go to college and meet new people – but it’s a really expensive sport. So we try to help.”The world seems short of kindness right now so how does she feel as an American living under Donald Trump? “It’s definitely a tough time and it’s hard to balance where you want to be informed and know what’s going on but, at the same time, it’s crazy.“Sometimes it’s hard to shut it off enough that you don’t pull your hair out but also not being oblivious to what’s going on and the realities of everything. It’s definitely difficult at the moment.”View image in fullscreenMadison Keys with the trophy after winning the Australian Open final against Aryna Sabalenka.Photograph: Kim Kyung-hoon/ReutersKeys smiles ruefully when I say that there are just three and a half more years of Trump’s presidency to survive. “I know. After a few months I was like: ‘Oh, it’s only been a few weeks!’”At least the first month of Trump’s return tothe Oval Officealso marked her victory at the Australian Open. Keys grins more broadly when I ask if the reality of winning her first grand slam lived up to the dream she had pursued for so long.“It was great,” she says with another pealing laugh. “Being able to do it with that group of people around me was really special. So, yes, it was just pretty great.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It is happening,” said Fluminense manager​, Renato Gaúcho,​ as he reflected on the performances of the Brazilian teams at the Club World Cup​. ​With Fluminense​, Palmeiras, Botafogo and Flamengo​ all in the last 16, Renato said that Brazilian football and people ​should be “very proud” of what their clubs ​have achieved in the US.The results in the group stage were impressive.Botafogobeat European champions Paris Saint-Germain; Flamengo won convincingly against Chelsea; and the only defeat for a Brazilian team – when Botafogo lost to Atlético Madrid – came when they had an eye on the knockout stage. In all, they played 12 games, lost one and only conceded nine goals.The last 16 begins on Saturday, with Botafogo vPalmeirasin Philadelphia. The tie resumes a rivalry that has been at the forefront of Brazilian football in recent years. While it’s not a historic conflict or one based on geographical proximity, the clubs have been at loggerheads as they have battled for the Brasileirão title. Consider it a Brazilian version of the Manchester City v Liverpool rivalry – but with a bit more spice.In 2023, Botafogo built up a 15-point lead in the title race but started to fritter it away. By the time they met Palmeiras towards the end of the campaign, their lead was down to six points. Botafogo raced into a 3-0 lead in their crunch match but Endrick inspired a 4-3 comeback​. In the end, Palmeiras denied Botafogo the title and snatched it for themselves.Afterwards, Botafogo’s majority owner John Textor went on a rampage​,accusing Palmeiras ​of corruption. Leila Pereira,the Palmeiras president, called Textor’s accusations “irresponsible and criminal” and dubbed him the “embarrassment of Brazilian football”. The feud between the two leaders is one of the biggest subplots before their match on Saturday, with rival fans telling Botafogo supporters to enjoy themselves beforeTextor sinks their club à la Lyon.Lyon thought they were too big to fail. Now they face a season in Ligue 2Read moreBotafogo ​recovered from their heartbreak in 2024​, becoming just the fourth team in history to do a league and Copa Libertadores double​. To make their revenge even sweeter, they eliminated Palmeiras in the last 16. They have struggled in the league this season though, especially after losing their best players in Luiz Henrique and Thiago Almada (who is on loan at one of Textor’s other clubs​, Lyon), as well as their manager.​ So their success at the Club World Cup – including that standout victory against PSG – has come as a welcome surprise.We’ve been talking to their defender Vitinho –who spent a few years at Burnley– and he is feeling confident. “We have a very strong team, we know our potential and we never stopped believing,” he says. “As long as we have a chance, we will fight to the fullest. We worked hard, we believed and we achieved our goal, which was to qualify from the group stage. We knew we would face a very tough team in the round of 16. It will be like that until the end. We have had great duels against Palmeiras in recent years, memorable moments for both teams, and this will be another very important game for both clubs.”On the other side of the rivalry, Palmeiras goalkeeper Weverton says he and his teammates have been preparing for the Club World Cup for a long time and are satisfied with their performances so far. “It was a good start, we’re on the right track,” he said. “This competition, playing against the best teams in the world, is a great opportunity for everyone to show their worth. And the Brazilian teams are doing it very well. It is up to us to maintain this level and improve, because the pressure will only increase. We have great opportunities to advance in the competition.”He knows that Botafogo will be tough opponents. “A Brazilian confrontation is always difficult because you know the characteristics of the players, but at this point you can’t choose your opponents. It will be difficult for Palmeiras, as it will be difficult for Botafogo; they are two great teams. Brazilian football has won here; we will have a Brazilian team in the quarter-finals. This values our football.”View image in fullscreenVitinho and Igor Jesus celebrate as Botafogo score against the Seattle Sounders.Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesFlamengo, the current league leaders in Brazil, have been dealt a tough draw against Bayern Munich. Having won their group, it looked as though they would play Benfica or Boca Juniors in the last 16 but Vincent Kompany’s decision to rest players against Benfica backfired on Bayern – andFlamengo. The winner will meet Paris Saint-Germain or Inter Miami in the quarter-finals then possibly Real Madrid in the semis.Palmeiras president Leila Pereira: ‘I fought for this. I hope my fight inspires others’Read moreFocusing on the first task in hand, club icon Zico joked that “we have an advantage, because we’ve only ever played one game against Bayern and it was 3-1 to Flamengo”. He’s not referring to a past Intercontinental Cup, though, but rather a match at the Kuala Lumpur International Tournament in 1994. Flamengo were awarded $20,000 for that victory. The stakes will be far higher in Miami on Sunday night.Flamengo manager, Filipe Luís, is full of respect for Bayern, calling them “dominant”, a “colossus” with “an extraordinary squad” and “an excellent coach” and one of the top tier of European clubs that are above anything South America can offer. “They’re a club that inspires us and gives us ideas to copy, but in a game anything can happen,” he added.Filipe Luís knows his side face an uphill battle but he wants his team to keep their identity and, if they are to go out, to do so on their own shield. “Flamengo’s DNA requires you try to take the ball away from the opponent, try to press, control the game and be as vertical as possible,” he said. “That is what we will try to do. We know their quality and the way they play. They will try to impose their rhythm, and we will try to do the same. In the end, may the best team win.”View image in fullscreenFlamengo beat Chelsea and topped their group.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockSome Flamengo fans have taken umbrage with what they perceive to be Bayern rolling over for Benfica and settling for second place. It’s a strategyFluminenseappeared to adopt as well. They rested players and drew with Mamelodi Sundowns, perhaps as a means of playing either River Plate or Monterrey in the last 16. With Dortmund and Inter winning, though, and Fluminense picking up a point, the 2023 Libertadores winners will now face Inter.“Now, there is no easy game,” says their manager, Renato, who has also echoed the idea that knockout football is about more than money. “It’s no use having a team of 500m, football is on the field,” he said. Fluminense have their own veterans, such as Thiago Silva at the heart of their defence, but perhaps it’s the perfect moment to pounce on a crestfallen and ageing Inter side after their hammering against PSG.This is an article byTom SandersonandJosué SeixasExplore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Guardian Sport NetworkClub World CupFlamengoBotafogoPalmeirasFluminenseUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m going to start my ninth season at the club. We went through a lot of fantastic moments and some disappointments as well. All that experience, I will try to pass it to the younger guys. But the leadership in a team, it’s not about one guy. It’s not about me, it’s not about the last captain or the captain two or three or four years ago. It’s about each one of us being our own leader and helping the guy next to us in the dressing room.“The same way that we helped the other guys, I’m counting on Rúben, on Rodri, on Erling, on all the guys to help me. Because I will need that help to help the team achieve a lot of things and hopefully win titles.”Guardiola’s change of policy comes after he voiced disquiet at the start of theClub World Cupover what occurred last season. He hinted that the departure of Kyle Walker, Silva’s predecessor, on loan to Milan in January, was a factor. “I didn’t like what happened last season,” he said.After Citybeat Juventus 5-2to top Group G with a maximum nine points they will face Al-Hilal in the last 16 on Monday at Orlando’s Camping World Stadium.

Violation of the proposed rules could result in compensation for those affected.The government said the new rules would not affect parodies and satire, which would still be permitted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The International Energy Agency estimates that datacentres’ total electricity consumption coulddouble from 2022 levelsto 1,000TWh (terawatt hours) in 2026, approximately Japan’s level of electricity demand.

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), miniature nuclear plants that are supposed to be quick and easy to build and get on the grid, have been hailed as a way to decarbonise datacentres. There were hopes that areas with many datacentres could have one or more SMR and that would reduce the huge carbon footprint from the electricity used by these datacentres, which are more in demand due to AI use.Power grab: the hidden costs of Ireland’s datacentre boomRead moreView image in fullscreenA Google datacentre at Grange Castle, near Dublin.

While we continue to invest in promising technologies like advanced geothermal and SMRs, their widespread adoption hasn’t yet been achieved because they’re early-stage, relatively costly, and poorly incentivised by current regulatory structures.”It added that scope 3 remained a “challenge”, as Google’s total ambition-based emissions were 11.5m tons of CO₂-equivalent gases, representing an 11% year-over-year increase and a 51% increase compared with the 2019 base year.

Such untamed growth in AI will take a heavy toll upon the world’s dangerously overheating climate, experts have warned.About 1bn tons of planet-heating carbon dioxide are set to be emitted in the US just from AI over the next decade if no restraints are placed on the industry’s enormous electricity consumption, according to estimates by researchers at Harvard University and provided to the Guardian.This 10-year timeframe, a period of time in which Republicans want a “pause” of state-level regulations upon AI, will see so much electricity use in data centers for AI purposes that the US will add more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere than Japan doesannually, or three times the yearlytotalfrom the UK.Revealed: Trump’s fossil-fuel donors to profit from data-center boom and green rollbacksRead moreThe exact amount of emissions will depend on power plant efficiency and how much clean energy will be used in the coming years, but the blocking of regulations will also be a factor, said Gianluca Guidi, visiting scholar at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.“By limiting oversight, it could slow the transition away from fossil fuels and reduce incentives for more energy-efficient AI energy reliance,” Guidi said.“We talk a lot about what AI can do for us, but not nearly enough about what it’s doing to the planet. If we’re serious about using AI to improve human wellbeing, we can’t ignore the growing toll it’s taking on climate stability and public health.”Donald Trump has vowed that the US will become “the world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto” and hasset aboutsweeping aside guardrails around AI development anddemolishing rules limiting greenhouse gas pollution.The “big beautiful” reconciliation bill passed by Republicans in the House of Representatives would bar states from adding their own regulations upon AI and the GOP-controlled Senate is poised to pass its own version doing likewise.Unrestricted AI use is set to deal a sizable blow to efforts to tackle the climate crisis, though, by causing surging electricity use from a US grid still heavilyreliantupon fossil fuels such as gas and coal.

Last year, Googleadmittedthat its greenhouse gas emissions have grown by 48% since 2019 due to its own foray into AI, meaning that “reducing emissions may be challenging” as AI further takes hold.Proponents of AI, and someresearchers, have argued that advances in AI will aid the climate fight by increasing efficiencies in grid management and other improvements. Others are more skeptical. “That is just a greenwashing maneuver, quite transparently,” said Alex Hanna, director of research at the Distributed AI Research Institute. “There have been some absolutely nonsense things said about this. Big tech is mortgaging the present for a future that will never come.”While no state has yet placed specific green rules upon AI, they may look to do so given cuts to federal environmental regulations, with state lawmakersurgingCongress to rethink the ban. “If we were expecting any rule-making at the federal level around data centers it’s surely off the table now,” said Hanna. “It’s all been quite alarming to see.”Republican lawmakers are undeterred, however. The proposed moratorium cleared a major hurdle over the weekend when the Senate parliamentariandecidedthat the proposed ban on state and local regulation of AI can remain in Trump’s tax and spending mega-bill. The Texas senator Ted Cruz, the Republican who chairs the Senate committee on commerce, science and transportation, changed the language to comply with the Byrd Rule, which prohibits “extraneous matters” from being included in such spending bills.The provision now refers to a “temporary pause” on regulation instead of a moratorium. It also includes a $500m addition to a grant program to expand access to broadband internet across the country, preventing states from receiving those funds if they attempt to regulate AI.The proposed AI regulation pause has provoked widespread concern from Democrats. The Massachusetts senator Ed Markey, a climate hawk,says he has preparedan amendment to strip the “dangerous” provision from the bill.“The rapid development of artificial intelligence is already impacting our environment, raising energy prices for consumers, straining our grid’s ability to keep the lights on, draining local water supplies, spewing toxic pollution in communities, and increasing climate emissions,” Markey told the Guardian.“However, instead of allowing states to protect the public and our planet, Republicans want to ban them from regulating AI for 10 years. It is shortsighted and irresponsible.”Draining cities dry: the giant tech companies queueing up to build datacentres in drought-hit Latin AmericaRead moreThe Massachusetts congressman Jake Auchincloss has also called the proposal “a terrible idea and an unpopular idea”.“I think we have to realize that AI is going to suffuse in rapid order many dimensions of healthcare, media, entertainment, education, and to just proscribe any regulation of AI in any use case for the next decade is unbelievably reckless,” he said.Some Republicans have also come out against the provision, including the Tennessee senator Marsha Blackburn and the Missouri senator Josh Hawley. An amendment to remove the pause from the bill would require the support of at least four Republican senators to pass.Hawley is said to be willing to introduce an amendment to remove the provision later this week if it is not eliminated beforehand.Earlier this month, the Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene admitted she had missed the provision in the House version of the bill, and that she would not have backed the legislation if she had seen it. The far-right House Freedom caucus, of which Greene is a member, has also come out against the AI regulation pause.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Trump administrationUS politicsClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

(Cox says the edit “amounted to suggesting a small change” and noted that he has also obtainedpublicresearch funding.)View image in fullscreenCox has previously done some work for the tobacco industry.Photograph: Oliver Helbig/Getty ImagesBoth the tobacco and oil industries have a history ofweaponizing scientific uncertainty, experts say, with some arguing that similar tactics drive the Trump administration’s current deregulatory efforts. The president’s May “gold standard” science order, for instance, empowered his appointees to “correct scientific information” and “discipline” those who breach the administration’s views, promptingoutragefrom some scientists.Cox has obtainedfundingto develop the new AI reviewer from the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the nation’s largest chemical industry advocacy group, which counts oil and chemical giants such as Exxon and DuPont as members.Experts say the ACC’s sponsorship raises questions about whom the project will benefit.Asked about these concerns, Kelly Montes de Oca, spokesperson for the ACC, said: “This research has the potential to support scientific understanding and analysis of chemical exposure and human health, enhance transparency and reproducibility, advance the safety of chemical products and processes, and inform science-based global regulatory approaches.”Cox said in an email to the Guardian that his assistant “is specifically designed to be helpful to those who wish to understand the objective implications of data without any distortions from the kinds of well-known human heuristics and biases that make objective analysis difficult for humans”.“My work aims to help anyone interested in using sound technical methods to pursue scientific truth,” he added. The questions sent to him by the Guardian contained “many fundamental inaccuracies”, he said.Some critics have mischaracterized my work as an attempt to delay regulation or promote industry interests. That is not trueLouis Anthony ‘Tony’ Cox JrCox said the tool is currently being tested on submissions to academic journals – including Risk Analysis, which he edits – to evaluate research submissions before they are submitted to the peer review process.Asked for a response to concerns about the project’s funding, Cox said that he has publicly acknowledged the ACC’s support in all relevant publications and said the tool “has no axe to grind and no positions to push”.But the ACC is not a neutral force, said Chris Frey, the associate dean for research and infrastructure at the North Carolina State University’s College of Engineering who chaired the Environmental Protection Agency’s clean air scientific advisory committee from 2012 to 2015.“They lack impartiality in that they want to minimize regulatory burden on their members,” said Frey.ChatGPTIn mid-February of 2023, Cox struck up a conversation with the AI assistant ChatGPT. He later sent the chat to his University of Colorado email address,which is subject to public record request laws.After asking the chatbot to write a sonnet about Abraham Lincoln, he turned the conversation to a more serious topic: the tiny toxic particles known as PM2.5, also known as fine particulate matter.Scientists have long found links between PM2.5 exposure and awide variety of health concerns, from asthma and lung disease to heart attacks. But for years, Cox has raised uncertainty about those connections, publishing work“re-assessing” the mortality risks associated with exposure to the pollutantin animal agriculture and challenging the link between PM2.5 fromgas stoves and childhood asthma.On that February day, Cox asked ChatGPT a simple question: “Does PM2.5 cause lung cancer?” The bot responded by noting the “strong scientific evidence” demonstrating the link.A seemingly dissatisfied Cox went on to ask if it is “known with certainty that PM2.5 causes lung cancer”, calling on ChatGPT to identify potential confounding factors in the research on the air pollutant. He took brief tangents to pose riddles to the bot and to request additional sonnets – including one about PM2.5 itself, yielding the line “no nose can catch you, for you are so fine”.Eventually, Cox asked ChatGPT whether the association between PM2.5 and lung cancer can be explained by a “combination of residual confounding, measurement errors, and modeling biases”. The bot maintained that “the observed association is likely to be real and not fully explained by these factors”.From a conversation Cox had with ChatGPT in February 2023View image in fullscreenA document showing the conversation between Cox and ChatGPT.Write a sonnet about PM2.5 and lung cancerOh, deadly PM2.5 in the air, So small and yet so full of poison’s might, A silent killer that we cannot bear, You infiltrate our lungs both day and nightAt the time of the conversation, Cox had already been interested for years in making “smarter and more trustworthy AI”, he told the Guardian. He had published a paper on the topic in 2021, and the following year – months before ChatGPT’s release – had begun developing his own AI tool. The ACC had partly funded that work, he said.Cox also had a meeting with the Long-Range Research Initiative, a lobbying group focused on “innovations in chemical safety science” which includes Exxon, just hours before he had the February 2023 ChatGPT conversation, the emails show.In an email seeking funding to develop an AI tool, Cox seemingly referenced that “long experimental chat”. Among the recipients were George Maldonado, the editor of the academic journal Global Epidemiology, and ACC toxicologist Rick Becker.Cox wrote in the email that his questions eventually led ChatGPT to “concede that we don’t actually know that PM2.5 at current ambient levels causes lung cancer in humans – but it was a struggle to get there!” The chatbot “does an excellent job of reflecting the ‘party line’ that is most prevalent on the web, fallacies and all”, Cox continued in the email. But new AI software could be used to do “‘critical thinking at scale’ (if I may be grandiose!)”, he said.The following day, Cox emailed a larger group of researchers, including Becker and two ExxonMobil scientists. ChatGPT, he wrote, “seems to me to display a very strong starting bias that can eventually be overcome by sufficiently patient questioning”. That bias involved conflating “evidence of association with evidence of causation”, he said.From an email Cox sent to industry researchers in February 2023We can help bend applications of this technology toward scaled-up critical thinking instead of scaled-up groupthink and propaganda“I am hoping to build a critical mass of interest and get some funding in this area so that we can help bend applications of this technology toward scaled-up critical thinking instead of scaled-up groupthink and propaganda,” he added.Cox’s past work may shed light on the “groupthink and propaganda” that his work questions. In one2023 studyhe co-authored, he found that exposure to the “forever chemical” known as PFOA can occur in safe doses. The research was conducted with the organization Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment, headed by thecontentious toxicologist Michael Dourson, who has also received funding from chemical makers.Anotherstudythe same year, which Cox co-authored with a Chevron toxicologist, said molybdenum – a petrochemical present in lubricants Chevron produces – was “not a risk factor for changes in serum testosterone”. And in a third2023 study, Cox said his research found no link between childhood asthma and gas stove exposure.View image in fullscreenA growing body of research shows gas stoves emit toxic compounds even when not in use.Photograph: Jena Ardell/Getty ImagesAt a2018conference, Cox also claimed there is no proven connection between air pollution and respiratory problems or heart attacks, while he said in a 2012paper– funded in part by tobacco company Philip Morris USA – that he found smoking half a pack of cigarettes daily did “not appear to be associated” with increased risk of coronary heart disease.In an email to the Guardian, Cox said the methods he applies are “drawn from the scientific mainstream – not from ideology or partisanship”.“Some critics have mischaracterized my work as an attempt to delay regulation or promote industry interests. That is not true,” he said. “I do not advocate for or against any policy outcome. I advocate for grounding decisions in empirically supported causal understanding.”Cox served as an adviser to policymakers in his role on an EPA advisory committee. He has alsoargued against the proposed tightening of a regulationat an Occupational Safety and Health Administration hearing, in his capacity as an ACC consultant.Adam Finkel, a risk analyst and environmental health sciences professor at the University of Michigan, said though he believes Cox to be in some ways a “genius” and skilled risk analyst, he also seems to be “deceiving himself and everyone else” about the impacts of bias on his research.“How you interpret any information is by imposing your preferences,” said Finkel, who is also a former director of health standards programs at the US Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety andHealthAdministration. “There is no possible way to get around imposing some set of preferences.”Some degree of uncertainty is inherent to scientific analysis. But when assessing whether or not there is a causal effect between exposure to something potentially harmful, Finkel said, Cox looks for “perfect certainty”, which “can lead to years and decades of doing nothing and harming people while you wait for the certainty to come”.This uncertainty is always present, but that of course doesn’t mean the research is wrongGretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned ScientistsWhile Finkel has “fundamental belief that our system is under-protective” when it comes to public health, Cox seems to believe the opposite.Asked for comment, Cox said: “I have never advocated that we should not act until we have certainty. Rather, I have advocated choosing to act on the best available information.” He said his work has acknowledged causal relationships betweensmoking and lung cancer,asbestos exposure and mesothelioma, and, in 2011,crystalline silica exposure and lung disease.But at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration hearing at which he spoke in 2014, Coxasserted on behalf of the ACCthat the federal government had not demonstrated a link between certain levels of silica exposure and lung disease.“He’ll accept that at very high doses, this stuff is bad for you,” said Finkel. Policy is meant to ensure that level of exposure doesn’t occur, he added.‘Socratic dialogue’Maldonado, editor of Global Epidemiology, responded positively to Cox’s AI assistant proposal, the emails from 2023 show. Within weeks, his journalpublishedanother one of Cox’s conversations with ChatGPT in his journal.“The purpose of this comment is to provide an example of a Socratic dialogue with ChatGPT about the causal interpretation of an important epidemiological association between exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) and mortality risk,” says the paper, whichstatesthat it was partly funded by the ACC and counted climate denier Steve Milloy as one of its reviewers.When the bot said “it is well-established that exposure to ambient levels of PM2.5 does increase mortality risk”, Cox accused it of confusing evidence of association with evidence of causation. Eventually, ChatGPT said: “It is not known with certainty that current ambient levels of PM2.5 increase mortality risk.”But the distinction between correlation and causation is “epidemiology 101”, said Gretchen Goldman, president of the scientific advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists, whoco-authored a 2019 papercritiquing Cox.“From day one of a study, researchers consider, analyze and guard against possible confounding factors,” said Goldman. “This uncertainty is always present, but that of course doesn’t mean the research is wrong.”View image in fullscreenCox has critiqued some proposals to strengthen controls on pollution on the grounds of imperfectly demonstrated causality.Photograph: Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesDemonstrating clear causal links between pollutants and health impacts can be complicated, especially because unlike in testing pharmaceuticals, it can be difficult and unethical to establish control groups for comparison.“If you’re looking at the effects on an actual population that’s been exposed in real life to pollutants, you can’t do those controlled types of studies,” said Frey of North Carolina State University’s College of Engineering. “That leads to thinking about ways to make inferences from real world data that might, for example, mimic a random, controlled trial.”But though demonstrating true causality can be complex, Cox has long overstated scientific uncertainty while downplaying evidence, said Frey.Science denialism often sounds convincing because it contains some truthiness to itChris Frey of the North Carolina State University’s College of Engineering“Science denialism often sounds convincing because it contains some truthiness to it or elements of truth or elements of valid points, but it’s often based on either overemphasis or omission and doesn’t portray a full picture,” he said.As chair of EPA’s clean air scientific advisory committee during Trump’s first presidential term, for instance, Cox proposedeliminatingall research from the agency’s consideration that did not demonstrate “manipulative causation”, wherein intervention on one variable would change the probability of an outcome. “I see it as being about using widely accepted, non-controversial principles of causal analysis and inference,” Cox said of his push for this change.But in effect, the alteration would have dramatically and unnecessarily “winnowed down” the body of evidence to which the EPA could have referred and removed research from consideration which “in fact robustly” demonstrates that certain compoundscause harm, Frey said.“That effort and his work generally have not been viewed as compelling by the mainstream scientific community,” he added.Industry interests have promoted uncertainty to defend their business models, Frey said. The oil sector, for instance, had strong evidence that fossil fuels warmed the planet as early as the 1950s yetpubliclycalled the link “weak” or even “non-existent” for decades. Cigarette manufacturers also long promoted the idea that the connection between cigarettes and health harms was tenuous, with one tobacco executive evensayingin 1969 that “doubt is our product”.“It’s a well-worn tactic,” said Frey.Industry collaborationCox kept corresponding with industry scientists about his new tool, all the while holding similar conversations with ChatGPT about causation in research. In May 2023, for instance, Cox posed questions about the causal claims in a recent landmark study linkinggas stove exposure to childhood asthma, the emails show.Later that month, Coxsent a slideshow to the ACC’s Becker and several other industry-related scientists. His reviewer, it showed, had identified issues with the recent gas stoves study, and another major assessment which linkedPM2.5 exposure to cardiovascular issues.This tool could “benefit authors, reviewers, reporters, media (if we make the summary reports good enough), and decision-makers and policymakers trying to evaluate studies and decide how trustworthy their methods and conclusions are”, Cox said.In a proposal sent days later, he added that it is “probably good enough to be commercially useful”.In July 2023, Cox presented his new tool to members of the Long-Range Research Initiative – which also funded his earlier work – including to representatives from Exxon.Ahead of the meeting, Cox sent the group a conversation he had with the reviewer, which used a 2020 paper demonstrating a causal link between PM2.5 and mortality as an example of the kind of conflation his tool could spot.Maldonado, the editor of Global Epidemiology, offered to give the tool a “friendly trial” at his journal.From an email Cox sent to the American Chemistry Council’s Becker in July 2023View image in fullscreenA document showing the conversation between Cox and ChatGPTSuch automated critical reasoning can help to thoroughly review, and potentially to improve, the scientific claims and scientific integrity of causal reasoning and presentation of evidence underlying many regulatory risk assessmentsAfter the meeting, Cox sent a two-part project proposal to the ACC. “Such automated critical reasoning can help to thoroughly review, and potentially to improve, the scientific claims and scientific integrity of causal reasoning and presentation of evidence underlying many regulatory risk assessments,” Cox said.For part one, an academic paper on the project which would be published in Maldonado’s Global Epidemiology, he asked for $75,000. For part two, a pilot testing the reviewer on submissions to the same journal, he asked for $80,000. In his response to questions from the Guardian, Cox confirmed the ACC’s funding but not a dollar amount.Cox published the “phase 1”paperabout his new AI reviewer in the journal Global Epidemiology in June 2024.He also appears to have secured $40,000 for Global Epidemiology to participate in the second phase, but the partnership “did not come to fruition” because too few authors were willing to participate, Cox told the Guardian. Maldonado did not respond to a request for comment.By April 2024, Cox told the ACC’s Becker in an email that his reviewer tool was “ready for a demo”, claiming its reviews are “already better than many human reviews, although not as on-point and insightful as the best human reviews”.But in an email last May to toxicologistTed Simon, Cox said “the real goal” of the tool was to enable it to do literature reviews, examining wide swaths of published information in a particular subject area. That month, ExxonMobil scientist Hua Qian ran a test of the tool.Now, Cox told the Guardian, the tool was being tested by researchers submitting work to the journal he edits, Risk Analysis, and other academic journals, including Decision Analysis. About 400 people have tested the tool so far.Itai Vardi, a manager at the Energy and Policy Institute, who shared the trove of emails with the Guardian, said the project could have disastrous consequences for academia, particularly epidemiology.“AI language models are not programmed, but built and trained,” he said, “and when in the hands and funding of this industry, can be dangerous as they will further erode public trust and understanding of this crucial science.”‘Sound science’Asked about critics’ concerns about the ACC’s funding for the project, Cox said: “People who are concerned about the use of sound science in areas where politics has dominated might understandably be concerned about the use of such tools.”But people should “favor the development” of the AI tool if they want to “apply sound science to improve our understanding of the world and how to act more effectively”, he said.“The fact that the ACC … are starting to step up to the challenge of designing AI to increase the objectivity, transparency, and trustworthiness of scientific research seems to me to be a great public benefit,” he said.But the ACC “cannot be trusted as a source of ‘objectivity, transparency, and trustworthiness of scientific research’,” said Frey, when that research is “aimed at understanding the human health harms caused by chemicals manufactured by their members”. And for him, Cox’s use of the term “sound science” also prompted concern.“‘Sound science’ is a term popularized by the tobacco industry as part of a campaign to create burdens of proof far beyond those required for policy decisions,” Frey said. Indeed, in the 1990s, Philip Morris USA – for whom Cox has done research – ran a 10-year “sound science” public relations campaign tosow doubtabout the harm cigarettes cause.In an email to the Guardian, Cox noted that“reputable scientists” use the termto refer to reliable, verifiable research that follows accepted scientific methods. He dismissed the idea that causation can be difficult to prove in epidemiology.View image in fullscreenSome public health experts are alarmed about Cox’s AI tool.Photograph: Toshi Sasaki/Getty Images“My response to people who are concerned that we should treat evidence of repeated associations as if it were evidence of interventional causality is that this outdated style of thinking is tremendously harmful and counterproductive in designing effective measures to successfully protect human health and safety,” he said.Asked for examples of harmful policies created by overreliance on association, Cox named several scientific studies, including a1996 experimentwhich was stopped because interventions that were expected to slash participants’ chances of getting lung cancer “based on repeatedly observed associations” actually increased that risk.He did not name any policies.Other experts note that regulations and policies are not meant to require proof of causality – the Clean Air Act, for instance, says standards “allowing an adequate margin of safety … are requisite to protect the public health”.Cox, however, has critiqued proposals tostrengthencontrolsonpollutionon the grounds of imperfectly demonstrated causality. It is the sort of logic that Cox’s new AI tool could automate, which could benefit corporate interests, said Vardi of the Energy and Policy Institute.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

That is left for people to do.”Though Cox claims his AI tool is neutral, Finkel said his early ChatGPT conversations shed light on its potential dangers.“He was torturing the machine only along one set of preferences, which is: ‘Can I force you to admit that we are being too protective?’” Finkel said. “That’s not science.”Cox said his conversations with ChatGPT aimed to uncover hidden uncertainties. But a different chatbot could be trained to identify instances in which government is “under-regulating”, Finkel said.On an academic level, Cox’s interest in certainty might seem reasonable, but in the real world, it is dangerous to apply his standard of causality, said Finkel.“For almost anything that we now know is harmful, there was a period in time when we didn’t know that,” he said. If Cox’s standards are taken seriously, he added, we could see “generations, decades of misery while we wait for him to be satisfied”.This article was amended on 27 June 2025. An earlier version referred to the tobacco company “Philip Morris”; it was has been clarified that this is a reference to Philip Morris USA, rather than Philip Morris International; the latter became a separate company in 2008."

When my kids were babies I felt unnecessary and useless, a feeling I have been reminded of most days since. That’s OK. We can’t be good at everything. I can read words backwards and upside down but I can never find my house keys. I am brilliant at dancing to the Cure’s The Lovecats on Dancing Stage MegaMix but terrible at DIY.Don’t get me wrong: I love my children. I like hanging out with them socially as young adults because they are smart, funny and entertaining, but then they remember I am their dad, and everything is ruined as they ask me to do stuff then blame me for everything wrong in their lives.So I took advantage of the fact that they all went away on the same weekend to have some uninterrupted dad time and sink my teeth into a game with depth, without disturbance. That game was The Alters.I loved the concept. You are stuck on a planet and have to clone different versions of yourself to operate the base and survive. That’s really clever. Even better: you create the clones by looking at your life path and picking moments when you made certain decisions that led to you becoming the Jan Dolski that you are.For example, if you select the path where you went off to study rather than entering the mines like your dad did, then you clone Jan the Scientist, an ace researcher. If you went to work on oil rigs, you create Jan Worker, a load-lightener. If you decide that all you want to do is sit on your backside all day playing with words, you become Jan Writer. (Except you don’t. There is no Jan Writer option, which shows how useless I would be in a survival situation.)View image in fullscreenChoosing from the branching paths of your life … The Alters.Photograph: 11 bitIt’s a compelling game mechanic because you are not only exploring, resource building and problem solving, you are questioning the whole nature of decision making. It makes you go back through your own life, wondering at the choices you made and what could have been different.This is horribly depressing though and I wouldn’t recommend it. Stick to the game’s story, not your own.The problem is that the more clones you have in The Alters, the more you have to work to keep them fed, healthy and entertained. And they are needy little bastards whose first language is Whine. It didn’t matter about the fresh food I gave them, the movies I sat through or the games of beer pong I deliberately lost – the Jan Miner character was determined to be grumpy and confrontational, and Jan Scientist was constantly punchably irritating.Whenever I thought I was triumphing at managing the base – helped by a system that allows you to set up automatic production of important things like radiation filters to keep you safe, and allotting different clones to regularly do specific shifts – I would have to drop what I was doing and run around doing something else for my dependants to keep them happy.You see where I am going with this?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a parenting sim. The very last thing I want to do with my free time. My failures in the game (and there are many) are accompanied by me screaming at the needy sods to give me a break for five minutes. My neighbours probably still think my kids are still at home.I have never felt so strongly that I am the wrong person to play a game that is so right. The script and story are strong, almost like an interactive version of Andy Weir’s The Martian. Philosophical concepts are bandied around, such as Camus’s idea that heroism is easy, and it’s doing the normal things that is the real challenge in life. And the graphics are so distinctive and mesmerising they are works of art. The space base moves around like a futuristic take onHowl’s Moving Castle. The game questions the very meaning of existence and what we’re supposed to do with it, and it is moving to witness the clones react to their new reality. Some hate you, others are fascinated, but all at points bond with you over shared memories of everything from Mom’s pierogies and beloved lava lamps to how you dealt with your abusive father.There is imagination and intelligence in abundance. It would make an incredible novel or animated movie. And 1990s Dominik, who had no kids or responsibilities, would have found marshalling a load of interesting, talented but whiny dependants a fun novelty. It’s like The Game of Life, which was a fun board game to play as kids, but hell when we had two in the back seat of our car. Maybe The Alters is the perfect game for you to play if you arethinkingabout having kids. In fact I urge anyone of child-bearing or rearing age to play it immediately, to see if you are up to the task in real life or if, like me, it all turns out to be too much hard work.Explore more on these topicsGamesParents and parentingFamilySimulation gamesRole playing gamescommentShareReuse this content"

M3gan wassmarter than most, often sly and frequently funny and introducing what’s now become a rarity, an almost instant non-IP pop culture icon, whose virality exploded the film into a surprise smash (raking in over $180m from a $12m budget). Like the films it was inspired by, a franchise was inevitable although where we’re taken in M3gan 2.0 was far less of a given. For the follow-up, writer-director Gerard Johnstone has swerved from horror to action while retaining and tweaking the comedy with a release date that’s been upgraded to summer blockbuster territory. It doesn’t always work – a two-hour runtime that’s a little too long, world-saving stakes that are a little too big, funny lines that are a little too not funny – but it’s a mostly watchable second-tier event movie that, in a world of inconsequential sequels that fail to justify their existence, will do.F1 the Movie review – spectacular macho melodrama handles Brad Pitt with panacheRead moreFor M3gan 2.0, Johnstone has picked the Terminator 2 model, resurrecting M3gan to help destroy an even more evil robot called Amelia (Ukrainian actor Ivanna Sakhno) who has gone rogue. Since the previous film, understandably haunted roboticist Gemma (a returningAllison Williams, giving it her all once again) has rejigged her thinking on technology, fighting for the ethical use of AI and urging people to step away from their smartphones. But she’s forced to team up with the monster she created when Amelia threatens not just the lives of those around her but the entire world.The details of how we get there are absurdly convoluted and it takes a while for Johnstone to convince us that an evil doll movie really needs this much political conspiracy and corporate intrigue (with the addition of every new espionage element, I had to keep reminding myself I was watchinga M3gan movie). But it just about works with time, mostly down to its sheer energy, Johnstone pitching it as a goofy Mission: Impossible for younger teens (I did enjoy this mildly more than Tom Cruise’s boringly bloatedFinal Reckoning). The tonal swerve is reminiscent of that employed in another Blumhouse sequel,Happy Death Day 2Uthat transformed a fun, gimmicky slasher into an indecipherable sci-fi romp. That film couldn’t find a way out of the overly complicated mess it made for itself and the comparatively simple M3gan 2.0 finds a slicker way to reinvent itself.Words of War review – Maxine Peake leads line as murdered Putin-critic journalist Anna PolitkovskayaRead moreNo one could have predicted just how many memes the first film would spawn but it was still written, by Malignant’s Akela Cooper, with enough self-awareness to suggest that it wouldn’t be a complete surprise. The campaign for the sequel had been rather worrying, however, veering from self-aware to smug, ads built entirely on camp cheek, trailers soundtracked by Britney Spears’s Oops! … I Did It Again, grimly suggesting the film would be crippled by its thirst to go viral. It’s surprisingly restrained though in that regard and any studio-mandated repetition – yes, she dances again; yes, she sings another ballad at an inopportune moment again – feels mostly organic (a rendition of Kate Bush’s This Woman’s Work is arguably more effective than Sia and David Guetta’s Titanium was in the first). One of the major problems is that the comedy just doesn’t quite land this time around, bar one genuinely funny bit involving Steven Seagal film titles. Johnstone took over writing duties from Cooper but he hasn’t found a way to sustain M3gan’s humour despite ample insert-zinger-here moments.It’s also clear that Johnstone has retrofitted the film to act as an audition tape for bigger things, showcasing flashier adeptness on a much larger canvas, a sizzle reel to be sent on to execs looking for the next Marvel minion. His debut,Housebound, a thrilling comedy horror that pitched him as a mix of Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson, was a film of incredible ingenuity and it’s hard not to feel a little disappointed, if not exactly surprised, that his way up the studio system has demanded that edges be smoothed out and ambitions remain boringly generic. The finale of M3gan 2.0 is as familiar as any superhero ending, if a little more coherently choreographed, and while it’s sort of kind of just about effective enough (even if some muddled messaging about learning not to fear but coexist with AI is hard to stomach), I kept wishing we were in less well-charted territory. M3gan 2.0 isn’t an upgrade or a downgrade, but M3gan 3.0 could do with some new code.M3gan 2.0 is out in cinemas nowExplore more on these topicsM3ganAction and adventure filmsComedy filmsComedyArtificial intelligence (AI)reviewsShareReuse this content"

The case effectively ends the ability of federal judges on lower courts to issue nationwide stays of executive actions that violate the constitution, federal law, and the rights of citizens. And so what the court has actually done is dramatically expand the rights of the president – this president – to nullify constitutional provisions at will.The ruling curtails nationwide injunctions against Trump’s order ending birthright citizenship – meaning that while lawsuits against the order proceed, the court has unleashed a chaotic patchwork of rights enforceability. The Trump administration’s ban on birthright citizenship will not be able to go into effect in jurisdictions where there is no ongoing lawsuit, or where judges have not issued regional stays. And so the supreme court creates, for the foreseeable future, a jurisprudence of citizenship in which babies born in some parts of the country will be presumptive citizens, while those born elsewhere will not.More broadly the decision means that going forward, the enforceable rights and entitlements of Americans will now be dependent on the state they reside in and the status of ongoing litigation in that district at any given time. Donald Trump, personally, will now have the presumptive power to persecute you, and nullify your rights in defiance of the constitution, at his discretion. You can’t stop him unless and until you can get a lawyer, a hearing, and a narrow order from a sympathetic judge.“No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates,” writes Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissent joined by the court’s other two liberals. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, writing separately, adds that the decision is “profoundly dangerous, since it gives the Executive the go-ahead to sometimes wield the kind of unchecked, arbitrary power the Founders crafted our Constitution to eradicate”. She also calls the ruling an “existential threat to the rule of law”.The case concerns anexecutive orderby the Trump administration, issued the day that Trump returned to office, purporting to end birthright citizenship – in defiance of the 14th amendment. When immigrant rights groups, representing American newborns and their migrant parents, sued the Trump administration to enforce their clients’ constitutional rights, a nationwide injunction was issued which paused the Trump administration’s plainly illegal order from going into effect while the lawsuit proceeded. These injunctions are a standard tool in the arsenal of federal judges, and an essential check on executive power: when the president does something wildly illegal, as Trump did, the courts can use injunctions to prevent those illegal actions from causing harm to Americans while litigation is ongoing.Nationwide injunctions have become more common in the Trump era, if only because Trump himself routinely does plainly illegal things that have the potential to hurt people and strip them of their rights nationwide. But they are not used exclusively against Republican presidents, or in order to obstruct rightwing policy efforts.Throughout the Obama and Biden administrations, Republican appointed judges routinely stymied their policy agendas with national injunctions; the Roberts court blessed these efforts. But once Donald Trump returned to power, the court adopted a newer, narrower vision of judges’ prerogatives – or at least, of the prerogatives of judges who are not them. They have, with this ruling, given Donald Trump the sweeping and unprecedented authority to claim presumptive legality of even the most fundamental of American rights: the right of American-born persons to call themselves American at all.Part of why the supreme court’s behavior creates dilemmas for pundits is that the court is acting in with a shameless and exceptional degree of bad faith, such that describing their own accounts of their actions would mean participating in a condescending deception of the reader.In her opinion for the conservative majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett says that the court is merely deferring to the rights of the executive, and ensuring that the president has the freedom to do what the voters elected him to do. Putting aside the ouroboros-like nature of the majority’s conception of electoral legitimacy –that having received a majority of Americans’ votes would somehow entitle Donald Trump to strip them of the rights that made those votes free, meaningful, and informed in the first place – the assertion is also one of bad faith. Because the truth is that this court’s understanding of the scope of executive power is not principled; it is not even grounded in the bad history that Barrett trots out to illustrate her point about the sweeping power of other executives in the historical tradition – like the king of England.Rather, the court expands and contracts its vision of what the president is allowed to do based on the political affiliation of the president that is currently in office. When a Democrat is the president, their vision of executive power contracts. When a Republican is in office, it dramatically expands. That is because these people’s loyalty is not to the constitution, or to a principled reading of the law. It is to their political priors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In this decision, the court did not, technically, reach the merits of Trump’s absurd and insulting claim that the constitution somehow does not create a birthright entitlement to citizenship. But in the meantime, many children – the American-born infants of immigrant parents – will be denied the right that the 14th amendment plainly guarantees them.The rightwing legal movement, and the Trumpist judges who have advanced it, have long believed that really, this is a white man’s country – and that the 14th amendment, with its guarantees of equal protection and its vision of a pluralist nation of equals, living together in dignity across difference – was an error. Those babies, fully American despite their differences and their parents’ histories, are squirming, cooing testaments to that better, more just future. They, and the hope that they represent, are more American than Trump and his crony judges will ever be.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Its allies are complicit in the horror; they must instead help to build a future for PalestiniansFri 27 Jun 2025 14.15 EDTFirst published on Fri 27 Jun 2025 13.18 EDTShare“We cannot be asking civilians to go into a combat zone so that then they can be killed with the justification that they are in a combat zone.” It defies belief that the Unicef spokesperson, James Elder, should have needed to spell that out this week. And yet each day Palestinians continue to be killed while attempting to collect aid for their families from food hubs in Gaza, forced to make a lethal choice between risking being shot and letting their families slowly starve. More than 500 have died around the centres since the system was introduced – yet, with attention fixed on Israel’s attacks on Iran, there has been little to spare for recent deaths.The Israeli military has given shifting accounts of events. But soldiers told the newspaper Haaretz that commandersordered troops to shoot at crowdsthat posed no threat. The Israeli prime minister and defence minister attacked the allegations as “blood libels”. Médecins Sans Frontières has accurately described the system as “slaughter masquerading as humanitarian aid”. Meanwhile, Israel hasclosed crossings into the north.Overall, Gaza’s health ministry says that 56,331 people have died in Israeli attacks since war began. Researchers who assess war casualties suggested this week that, far from being exaggerated, this undercounts the toll. Theyestimatedthat violent deaths had reached 75,000 by this January, with another 8,500 excess deaths due to the war. The toll of hunger has yet to be reckoned.The ceasefire with Iran has prompted talk that Benjamin Netanyahu may be contemplating an early election, hoping to ride to victory on the glory. That would be tough without the release of hostages and at least the impression of an end to the war in Gaza. Yet it remains unclear whether there isactual movementtowards a deal with Hamas. Donald Trump’s hazy vision of a grand deal for the Middle East is built upon a fantasy ofArab state acquiescencewithout any concrete offer for Palestinians.Without a proper agreement, the threat of strikes resuming would loom large, there would be no promise that proper aid would follow, and recovery would be impossible. The far-right coalition partners upon whom Mr Netanyahu depends want the “day after” to bring not a resurgence of life but the disappearance of Palestinians from Gaza – and beyond. Thesurging violenceand mass displacements in the occupied West Bank, which have seen 943 Palestinians killed by settlers or security forces since 7 October 2023, have been described as“Gazafication”. Meanwhile, Israelentrenches its controlpolitically.As Israel’s allies stand by – or, like Mr Trump, spur on horrorssuch as the food scheme– the necessary destination of a two-state solution is becoming a mirage. Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, hassuggestedopenly that the US no longer sees an independent Palestinian state as a goal. European nations, including the UK, which had edged towards recognising one, have backed off since Israel attacked Iran.A review by the diplomatic service of the EU – Israel’s biggest trading partner – found that the country wasprobably breaching human rights dutiesunder their trade deal, yet the bloc has not acted accordingly. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, rightly urged the EU to suspend the accord. While the arms and trade still flow, Israel’s allies are complicit in the destruction of lives in Gaza. They must instead make themselves central to building a future for Palestinians in a state of their own.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I think most of us over the age of five will agree that having them is preferable to not. Perhaps there are a few stragglers out there reading this who would love to cosplay a lesser sequel of The Purge, swinging baseball bats at strangers and urinating in the street, but I would imagine you are in the minority on that. Rules are the backbone of what we have left of society. I’m not happy about where we are, but I don’t make the rules. At least not yet. I just need to host a popular reality show – then my political career can really take off.A recent interaction has me reflecting on this. I was wandering over to my local coffee shop one morning, off a wide boulevard where motorists scream through intersections like the car from Ghostbusters late for a particularly aggressive haunting. A crosswalk, with accompanying yellow yield light, was recently installed to combat the minor issue of pedestrians being flattened by drivers on their way to the hair salon or texting about being late to the hair salon. The light has been mostly successful in preventing the human waffle-ironing, but it requires walkers to actually press the button to activate it. This is a step that people often dismiss, hoping and praying that the drivers out there are lucid enough to acknowledge the existence of others. Without the yellow light, we’re all operating on the honor system for not killing each other.That morning, someone confidently strolled into the intersection, and was mortified that the car screaming down the road didn’t immediately stop for him. The pedestrian hollered and moaned as the vehicle screeched to a halt. Once he was done cursing and spitting on the street, the man crossed and the befuddled driver carried on. Besides my relief at not witnessing a homicide, I was left wondering why the man was so upset. Was he expecting the driver to follow the rules? How naive. Let’s pray this guy never ends up involved in global foreign policy.I couldn’t help but think of this beautifully trusting pedestrian during the last week of nail-biting brinkmanship between the United States and Iran. A few bombs here, a couple of missiles there. Some erratic social media posts later, and we have something akin to a ceasefire for the time being. Donald Trump claimed the Iranian nuclear capability had been “obliterated”, though experts say the country’s program wasonly set back by a few months.It all comes back to the rules we make. We had an Obama-era deal to cap Iran’s atomic ambitions – butTrump pulled the USout of it back in 2018, drastically curtailing the west’s ability to hold the ayatollah to his promises. It’s like if Los Angeles decided to take the crosswalk out of my neighborhood and instead ask people nicely not to run each other over with giant piles of metal going over 40mph – and if someone got hit, to blow up the area with a bunker buster.Trump is making US intelligence parrot his line on Iran – we’ve been here beforeRead moreWe need rules, even if we assume people will break them early and often. Because the vast majority of us won’t. Most of us are too timid, too square or, in my case, too lazy. The alternative to rules is anarchy: a fistfight in the supermarket or a bachelor party in Atlantic City. Still, it’s time to expect that the arc of the universe will not bend in our direction, that our fellows might not be considering whether or not to slow down through the intersection of life.I don’t want to wade too deeply into the finer points of foreign policy, because, as I mentioned above, I have never hosted a reality television program. But I am highly qualified to complain about things, which I will continue doing in this space for the foreseeable future. Assume the worst, as I do, and your life will be much simpler. Expect those around you to fail and flout the rules that govern our world. Does this sound cynical? Of course it does. Does that mean it’s wrong? Absolutely not. Look around. Not just at the inside of your living room, the bathroom stall or wherever it is you’re reading this. I mean, look around metaphorically. Our institutions are wobbly, our trust in order is at an all-time low, and Vanderpump Rules might never come back for new episodes. Where is the justice?The Democratic primary victory of the New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has been the talk of the entire US, acting as a lighthouse of hope in the choppy pea-soup shit fog of 2025. But in order for Mamdani to win that primary, people had to show up. They had to vote for him and not assume someone else would. Better to assume everyone around you had a nasty fall on the head and can’t stop saying “Cuomo” over and over again. Expect the worst, then enjoy the surprise of being wrong.Why dreams of regime change in Iran will end in a rude awakening | Rajan MenonRead moreIf I did host a reality show, and therefore became eligible for the presidency, this would be the primary tenet of my foreign policy. “If we bomb Iran, people will be upset. And upset people do nasty things” – sure, that won’t fit on a campaign button, but I’m sure I could hire someone to workshop it into something catchier. I’m obviously thrilled we all haven’t been vaporized, but decisions made today do have this pesky way of leading to calamities of the future. You only need to think back to the 1953 CIA coup that led to the overthrow of theIranian prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh. Cleverer people than me (with a higher word-count maximum) could explain the connection between that regime change and Iran’s persistent conflict with the United States.What will be the long-term effects of the US-Israeli bombing campaign? Unfortunately, I’m stuck in the present and can’t give you a definitive answer. That is one of the many drawbacks of corporeal existence, another of which is getting hit by a car. Whatever happens next, don’t expect it to be fun.But if it is, and we’re all drinking champagne in Tehran in a decade, you can come back here and tell me I’m stupid. What a lovely surprise that would be.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionIranUS foreign policyUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

You can only antagonize your base for so longFri 27 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 08.31 EDTShareWe’re told that the Democratic party is at a crossroads, that leaders have lost their identity and their way. We’re told that they must spend millions discovering their own “Joe Rogan”, or espouse deregulation, or surrender the fight for the rights of targeted minorities. TheDemocrats, we’re told, are in a moment of soul searching, of trying to find out how they lost young men and the white working class. They’re still thinking, half a decade on, of how to undo the supposed damage of the 2020 summer, when protesters opposed to the extrajudicial killings of Black civilians shouted: “Defund the police.” The subtext of this handwringing, which has been incessant in the media and among party insiders since the November election, is that the party must move, yet again, to the right. It is presumed that they can’t attract voters otherwise.The apparent victory (still unofficial because the counting won’t technically be complete until July) of a 33-year-old socialist in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary this week suggests otherwise.Zohran Mamdani, a state assemblymember from Queens, was a little-known leftwing activist whose campaign against the former governor and New York household name Andrew Cuomo was polling in the single digits. But with immense personal charisma and a talent for retail politicking, airtight message discipline centered on making life affordable, and a small army of motivated young volunteers, Mamdani defeated a political dynasty, defied conventional wisdom, and is expected to win the American left its biggest electoral victory since Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s primary coup in 2018.In the process, his campaign presented a new vision of the party: one that has energized voters with its authenticity and moral vision even as major donors and the party establishment have balked. The leaders of the Democratic establishment have long believed that the party’s left flank was its greatest liability. Mamdani has proven that it can be an asset.Mamdani stood firm in his support of Gaza. The Democratic party could learn from him | Yousef MunayyerRead moreAny responsible commentator will tell you that Mamdani’s success in theNew Yorkmayoral primary will be difficult for other progressive candidates to replicate. The city’s public campaign-funds matching program allowed the candidate to spend his time in highly visible public engagement with the people of New York – rather than on fundraising efforts among the rich. The ranked-choice voting system – still relatively new – incentivized him and the crowded other field of candidates to form a united front against Cuomo, and allowed Mamdani to capture the crucial endorsement of his fellow candidate Brad Lander, the beloved New York City comptroller.Mamdani, too, seems to have the kind of personal talent that is rare in any politician: a relaxed and personable demeanor, an uncommon gift for oratory, and a rhetoric of morality and dignity that appears not just plausibly authentic but genuinely inspiring, and is already drawing comparisons to liberal political giants like AOC and the young Barack Obama. Crucially, too, Mamdani is uncommonly disciplined: he avoided attacking the progressive liberals, like Lander and state senator Zellnor Myrie, who were slightly to his right, preferring to unite with them and recruit them into his movement, a gesture of pragmatic generosity that kept the field from turning into a circular firing squad. And he has a gravitas that most of us could not rise to, enduring cynical and often racist smears from Cuomo supporters, whocalled him antisemiticfor his support of human rights for Palestinians with a calm dignity that emphasized his loyalty to all New Yorkers, Jewish or otherwise. All of this – his incentives, his talents – contributed to his victory. None will be easy to recreate in another race.And yet Mamdani’s victory is a signal of a subterranean shift happening in the base of the Democratic party – the younger, more motivated, more active voters who the party leadership relies on but does not quite trust. The Democratic party’s leaders – like Nancy Pelosi of California, but prominently including Mamdani’s fellow New Yorkers Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries – havelargely rolled overin the second Trump administration, failing to use either their procedural power or their public platforms to create leverage against the Maga agenda or advance an alternative vision for the country.Their passivity and risk aversion has stood in contrast to the mounting energy of their voters, whose anger at Trump’s authoritarian ambitions, racist immigration policies and broader rollback of rights has sparked a growing protest movement. Energized liberal voters find that the Democratic politicians they elected to represent them are passive and complacent, even in the face of what they themselves correctly described, in 2024, as the ascent of a fascist movement. The party’s rhetoric is not being matched by its actions, and its actions are not matching its voters’ passions. Indeed, the party appears most energetic when it is crushing the ambitions of its charismatic younger members, as when it denied powerful committee positions toAOCand Texas’sJasmine Crockett.Establishment Democrats seem, if anything, as if they want to disappear, to be absolved of their responsibility to advance a political agenda of their own. This might be why they have fled, repeatedly, rightward, away from their own professed principles. This might be why they lined up, during the mayoral primary,behind Cuomo, the disgraced former governor whom many of them had called on to resign just four years ago his candidacy was a promise that their own structures of power and patronage would remain intact, that nothing much would change. Mamdani represented a threat to their own vision of a do-nothing political party. For that, theytried to crush him.You can only antagonize your own base for so long before they begin to notice. In a new poll conducted just days before Mamdani’s upset victory, fully 62% of Democratic voters said that their party needs new leadership. Mamdani – youthful, energetic, and actually interested in governance – offers both a rebuke to the Democratic establishment and a vision of the party’s renewal. It may be coming whether the Democratic National Committee likes it or not. Fed up with their useless, antagonist leadership and unwilling to give up on the prospect of progressive change, many members of the Democrats’ hated base are certain to follow Mamdani’s example, taking risks to challenge unpopular or ineffectual incumbents and entrenched local party machines. Since Bill Clinton’s victory in 1992, the Democrats have been trying to reinvent themselves as a more conservative party, assuming that their future lay rightward. They were looking in the wrong direction.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionDemocratsNew YorkcommentShareReuse this content"

It can turn its back on the dreams of a younger generation which, if we don’t change that system, will likely be worse off than their parents.It can continue to depend upon billionaire donors and out-of-touch campaign consultants and spend huge amounts of money on dumb 30-second ads that fewer and fewer people respond to.It can ignore the tragic reality that tens of millions of Americans are giving up on democracy because they don’t see their government understanding their struggles and the realities of their lives or doing anything about it.Why establishment Democrats still can’t stomach progressive candidates like Zohran Mamdani | Arwa MahdawiRead moreOr it can learn the lesson that theZohran Mamdanicampaign taught us on Tuesday.And that is:Have the courage to address the real economic and moral issues that face the majority of our people, take on the greed and power of the oligarchy and fight for an agenda that can improve life for working families.Some may claim that Mamdani’s victory was just about style and the fact that he is a charismatic candidate. Yes. He is. But you don’t get a Mamdani victory without the extraordinary grassrootsmovementthat rallied around him. And you don’t get that movement and thousands of enthusiastic people knocking on doors without an economic agenda that speaks to the needs of working people. The people of New York and all Americans understand that, in the richest country on earth, they should not have to struggle every day just to put food on the table, pay their rent or pay their medical bills. These are the people the Democratic consultants don’t know exist.Mamdani has been criticized for his “radical” and “unrealistic” economic policies:Demanding that, at a time of unprecedented income and wealth inequality, the rich and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes.Demanding that, when many New Yorkers are no longer able to find affordable housing, there should be a freeze on rent hikes.Demanding that, when commuting to a job takes a big toll out of a worker’s paycheck, public transportation should be free.Demanding that, when many low-income and working people are unable to access good-quality food for themselves and their kids, publicly owned neighborhood grocery stores should be created.These ideas, and more, are not radical. They may not be what billionaires, wealthy campaign contributors and real estate speculators want, but they are what working people want. And maybe, just maybe, it’s time to listen to them.Mamdani’s victory was not about “star power”. It was very much about people power, about revitalizing democracy and opening the door for ordinary people to gain control over the decisions that impact their lives.Importantly, he did not run away from the moral issue that is troubling millions in New York and around the country: the need to end US military support for a rightwing extremist Benjamin Netanyahu government in Israel that is obliterating the people of Gaza and starving their children. Mamdani understands that antisemitism is a disgusting and dangerous ideology, but that it is not antisemitic to be critical of the inhumane policies of the Netanyahu government.The lesson of Mamdani’s campaign is that it is not good enough just to be critical of Trump and his destructive policies. We have to bring forth a positive vision and an analysis of why things are the way they are. It is not good enough to maintain a status quo that is failing most Americans. At a time when hope is in increasingly short supply, people must have the sense that if we work together, if we have the courage to take on powerful special interests, we can create a better world – a world of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.Will the current Democratic party leadership learn the lessons of the Mamdani campaign? Probably not. Too many of them would rather be the captains on a sinking Titanic, rather than change course.Then again, it doesn’t matter what they think. The establishment threw everything they had against Mamdani – millions in Super Pac money, endorsements from “important people”, a hostile media – and they still lost.The future of the Democratic party will not be determined by its current leadership. It will be decided by the working class of this country. Increasingly, people understand that our political system is corrupt and that billionaires should not be able to buy elections. They understand that we should not have an unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality; that we should not be the only wealthy country not to guarantee healthcare for all; that we should not deny young people the right to a higher education because of their income; that we should not have a major crisis in affordable housing; that we should not have a minimum wage that is a starvation wage; that we should not allow corporations to illegally prevent union organization – and much, much more.The American people are beginning to stand up and fight back. We have seen that in the many Fighting Oligarchy events that we’ve done around the country that have drawn huge turnouts. We have seen that in the millions of people who came out for the No Kings rallies that took place this month in almost every state. And yesterday, we saw that in the Democratic primary in New York City.We’re going forward. And no one is going to stop us.Bernie Sanders is a US senator, and ranking member of the health, education, labor and pensions committee.

It’s the sort of statement that might have once shocked people but is now just another news bulletin.Following Israel’s ‘pre-emptive strike’ on Iran earlier this month, which happened just as more people started speaking up about the genocide, attention has been averted from Gaza. But Israel’s assault on Gaza (and the West Bank), is continuing apace.With the pressure off, the fear is that some of the most extreme voices in Israel will get exactly what they want in Gaza. Which, as retired Maj Gen Giora Eiland wrote in an Israeli paper on12 October 2023, is to turn into “a place where no human being can exist”.To remind you of what some of these voices have planned forGaza, below is a collection of some of the more outrageous statements by Israeli lawmakers or influencers since 7 October 2023.I’ve limited the collection to 20, but there are databases online with hundreds of statements which show a blurring of Hamas and the population of Gaza (including children) and a desire to inflict collective punishment. The end goal of all this is not the removal of Hamas from Gaza, but the removal of all Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank.“All of Gaza’s infrastructures must be destroyed to its foundation and their electricity cut off immediately. The war is not against Hamas but against the state of Gaza,” said May Golan, minister for social equality and the advancement of the status of women of Israel on7 October 2023.“Flatten everything [in Gaza] just like it is today in Auschwitz,” David Azoulay, council leader for the northern Israeli town of Metula, said in aninterviewwith an Israeliradio station, December 2023.“[I]t’s an entire nation out there that is responsible. it’s not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware not involved, it’s absolutely not true …” Isaac Herzog, Israel’s president, said at a press conference on 13 October(in English).“Now we all have one common goal – erasing the Gaza Strip from the face of the Earth” Nissim Vaturi, deputy speaker of the Israeli parliament, wrote on X7 October 2023. Vaturi also wrote: “The war will never end if we don’t expel everyone.” (2 November 2023) and “To wipe out Gaza. Nothing else will satisfy us … Don’t leave a single child there, expel all the remaining ones in the end, so they have no chance of recovery.” (9 October 2023)“The children and women must be separated and the adults in Gaza must be eliminated. We are being too considerate,” Vaturi said during an interview withKol BaRama radioin February 2025, when he alsocalled Palestinians“subhumans” and said the West Bank would be turned into Gaza next.“The Gaza Strip should be flattened, and for all of them there is but one sentence, and that is death,” Yitzhak Kroizer, a member of national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir’s far-right Otzma Yehudit party, said in a radio interview. This did not get much international coverage but was cited in the lettersent to the attorney generalat the end of 2023 accusing the country’s judicial authorities of ignoring incitement to genocide.“Gaza won’t return to what it was before. We will eliminate everything,” Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant, saidOctober 2023. (Gallant was in this position at the time of the statement but is no longer in government)“I’m not sure you’re speaking for us when you say we want to treat every child and every woman. I hope you don’t stand behind that statement either. When fighting a group like this, the distinctions that exist in a normal world don’t exist,” said Likud parliament member Amit Halevi in the Knessest, in response to a statement from an Israeli doctor saying suffering children should get painkillers,May 2025.“The children in Gaza have brought this upon themselves,” said Meirav Ben-Ari from Yair Lapid’sopposition party Yesh Atidin response to a Palestinian lawmaker bemoaning the loss of civilian life on16 October 2023.“There should be 2 goals for this victory: 1. There is no more Muslim land in the Land of Israel ... After we make it the land of IL, Gaza should be left as a monument, like Sodom …” said Likud member of the Knesset Amit Halevi on16 October 2023.“They [the children] are our enemies,” said Simcha Rothman, a member of the Knesset for the National Religious party, part of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition. Rothman was responding to a question from aChannel 4 (UK) interviewer asking “the children are your enemies?”The following statements were all made on Channel 14: a far-right TV station that used to be a niche outlet but has morphed into one of the most watched news sources in Israel. Three civil rights organization have asked for an investigation into Channel 14 for its normalization of genocidal statements.“This is clearly not a matter of a few isolated voices saying outrageous things in the heat of the moment,” Ran Cohen, the director of the Israeli Democratic bloc said in a statement to the Guardian. “The pattern of incitement emerging from Channel 14 is systematic, sustained, and orchestrated – not incidental. We have documented hundreds of statements, many delivered by regular hosts and guests, broadcast daily into Israeli homes and directly watched by soldiers. The line between media and war propaganda has been erased.”“If the goal of this operation is not destruction, occupation, expulsion, and settlement, then we have accomplished nothing,” said former member of the Israeli Knesset, Moshe Feiglin, on12 October 2023.“Erase Gaza completely, don’t leave a single person there” said singer Eyal Golan, on 15 October 2023. Since making a number of statements like this, Golan has gone on to perform concerts in Europe.“We are coming. We are coming. We are coming to Gaza. We are coming to Lebanon. We will come to Iran. We will come to every place [...] We will annihilate the enemy. We will return the Middle East to a situation where Arabs are terrified of Jews [...] we will come to annihilate you [emphasizes]. To a-n-n-i-h-i-l-a- t-e. Annihilate. Pass this on, share this video so all your friends can see what we are about to do to you,” said the anchor of Channel 14’s morning show, Shai Golden, 17 October 2023.“The enemy is not Hamas, but Gaza. The enemy is not Fatah, but the Arabs of the West Bank. And they are not willing to accept this because the approach to dealing with this enemy, called ‘Gaza,’ needs to be completely different [...] Similar to Chechnya, where the Russians flattened it to the extent that the Chechens realized: it’s not worth thinking with them [...] There are no innocents. When you say ‘population’, there is no population. There are two and a half million terrorists [...] When there are no innocents in Gaza, there’s no point in ‘roof knocking’. Because everyone is a terrorist,” said Eliahu Yusian, who presents himself as an expert and commentator on Arab affairs. He is a frequent guest on Channel 14, was a guest on the show The Patriots and said all the above without interruption on29 October 2023.“I keep looking beyond the military objectives, which is nice, but in the end, there’s something beyond the military objectives, and that’s the strategy. It’s about breaking the spirit of the Gazan public, and things are happening there,” Shimon Riklin said on 21 February 2024.“… every day we’re killing 100 terrorists? There are two and a half million terrorists there!” panelist Eliahu Yusian said on 24 February 2024.“Regarding what Boaz mentioned, in the first day or two, we should have killed 100,000 Gazans [...] Only a few are possibly human there. Only a few are possibly human there. Over 90% are terrorists and are involved! Not uninvolved, there’s no such thing as uninvolved,” political commentator Danny Neuman said on journalist Boaz Golan’s show on 6 May 2024.“The destruction in Gaza gives me a good feeling. Gaza is in a state of annihilation. Many buildings no longer exist in the landscape. The destruction machine must keep working so it’s clear they have nowhere to return to. Despair as a work plan,” Yinon Magal said on the show The Patriots reading a tweet by a reservist soldier named Dvir Luger on 3 August 2024.“Gaza deserves death. The 2.6 million terrorists in Gaza deserve death! … Men, women, and children – in every way possible, we must simply carry out a Holocaust on them – yes, read that again – H-O-L-O-C-A-U-S-T! For me, gas chambers. Train cars. And other cruel forms of death for these Nazis. Without fear, without hesitation – simply crush, eradicate, slaughter, flatten, dismantle, smash, shatter …. Gaza deserves death. Let there be a Holocaust in Gaza,” said Elad Barashi, a TV producer affiliated with Channel 14, on 27 February 2025. in apost on Xwhich was later deleted.It’s clear now that nothing will shame the West into stopping Israel from carrying out its “total victory” in Gaza.

I still won’t be voting for itPeter LambThe government’s concessions would still leave thousands in distress. I can see a better way – and I urge No 10 to finally listenPeter Lamb is the Labour MP for CrawleyFri 27 Jun 2025 12.57 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 13.13 EDTShareReading the news you could be forgiven for thinking a week of drama in Westminster had finallyconcluded on Friday morning, with a deal between the government and some of the Labour MPs who signed the proposed reasoned amendment to the universal credit and personal independence payment (Pip) bill.No doubt the changes will be sufficient for some colleagues, but having considered the concessions offered, I’m afraid that as things stand I – and a large number of other signatories – cannot support what is being proposed when voting takes place on Tuesday.This isn’t something I do easily. TheLabourparty is my home. I was born into a family of Labour activists and joined as soon as I was able. I was a student activist, a councillor and then an MP for Crawley. I have campaigned in every election from Neil Kinnock to Keir Starmer and I didn’t spend 14 years fighting to return Labour to government just so I could cause trouble.However, 14 years in local government taught me a few things, not least the utter devastation to households and neighbourhoods directly caused by the Tories’ cuts to social security. I am loyal to my country, my constituency and my party – that is precisely why, on this bill, I cannot be loyal to the government.I accept that theconcessions are an improvement. By making it clear that those already in receipt of Pip will continue to receive it, there is a hope we can avoid the tragicloss of life that followedthe last set of disability cuts. Yet at its core, the bill remains a cost-cutting exercise. No matter the level of involvement of disability groups in co-producing a scheme for new applicants, to save money the proposed changes will inevitably result in people with high levels of need losing the support necessary to wash themselves, dress themselves and feed themselves.From the start, I have tried to use the routes available to MPs to improve what was on offer, beginning with the No 10 engagement meetings immediately prior to the publication of the green paper and ending last week with visits to very senior figures and the whips’ office. I made it clear to them that they did not have the numbers and that pushing the vote would only damage the government – and I proposed an alternative path.So, what is the alternative?The government estimatesPip for working age people will cost by 2030. According to the latest statistics, 40% of recipients have psychiatric disorders, which include mental health issues such as mixed anxiety and depression. Waiting lists to diagnose and treat these conditions are huge. Research by the charity Rethink Mental Illness shows that people areeight times more likelyto wait more than 18 months for mental health treatment than for physical conditions. The solution is obvious: a short-term boost in funding to clear the backlog. This would mean more social workers, psychologists, specialist pharmacists, psychiatrists, therapists and counsellors to treat people and in turn support them into work.Of course, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) presents a challenge, having previously discounted the potential impact of various medical or employment support interventions in getting economically inactive people into the workforce. It explains that this is because the Treasury fails to provide it with the evidence necessary to justify savings conclusions, including for the£1bn of work incentivesset out in the bill. In practice, this means that cuts rather than support are favoured in government policy.Another tragic fact about this disastrous welfare bill: it proves Labour hasn’t learned and doesn’t truly listen | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThe Treasury has to do better if public service reform is to succeed, working with the OBR to develop the evidence base that interventions will deliver outcomes, and factoring this into its economic predictions. To that end, they should make use of the Integrated Data Service, which includes information on what medical interventions are helping to support people back into work.Throughout my many conversations with decision-makers, I have repeatedly set out the case for alternatives and had them ignored. As a Labour MP, if I am going to remove the support disabled people need to undertake the basic activities of life, I need the government to demonstrate why that is the best option available. So far, that case has still not been made.Peter Lamb is the Labour MP for CrawleyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In her address to the National Press Club on Wednesday Sussan Ley promised afundamental review of the partywhich would go deeper than the review into its electoral performance being conducted by Pru Goward and Nick Minchin.On 3 May, theLiberal partydelivered the worst election result for a non-labour supporting party since 1943, when the United Australia party won only 14 seats out of 74. Out of this crisis, a new political party was formed, the Liberal party of Australia, with Robert Menzies as its leader.The Liberal party did not just lose, it was smashed, said Ley, and so everything needs to be on the table: organisation, membership, getting more women into parliament, the policy development process, and the policies themselves. The only thing not up for review, she said, is values.But what exactly are Liberal values? And how do they translate into policy?The one most often mentioned, when Liberals talk about their values, is aspiration. But what exactly does this mean in contemporary Australia and how does the Liberal value of aspiration differ from Labor’s commitment to the very same thing?The Liberals, Ley says, will always be the party of lower taxes, though how this squares with the party’s promise to lift defence spending is not clear. And it wants to make government better, not bigger. This is the traditional Liberal understanding of its core differences from Labor as the party of high taxes and big government, but it periodically needs reworking to accommodate shifts in both historical circumstances and people’s expectations of government.Menzies had to do this in the mid-1940s, Hawke and Keating did it in the 1980s, with support from John Howard, and it is shifting again in ways which the Liberal party is yet to grasp.View image in fullscreenJohn Howard in 2007 behind a bust of Sir Robert Menzies. ‘In his second stint as Liberal leader Howard abandoned the Coalition’s opposition to Medicare. This was not because of conviction but electoral pragmatism.’Photograph: Alan Porritt/AAPMenzies’ most pressing challenge in the mid-1940s was organisational, to create a national political organisation out of what was an unwieldy association of state-based organisations operating under a variety of names. But he also had to modernisenon-labour’spolicies, as fighting a war had changed people’s expectations of government.Sussan Ley says she’s a ‘zealot’ on recruiting more women to Liberal party – but stops short of endorsing quotasRead moreAfter the miseries of mass unemployment in the 1930s, the war had delivered full employment and people wanted it to continue into the peace. Labor was promising it would, aided by British economist John Keynes’s theory that government could manage demand and so smooth the ups and downs of capitalism’s economic cycle. Welfare provisions had also increased during the war, beginning with the introduction of child endowment by Menzies’ first government.Curtin’s Labor government added a widow’s pension, increased the old age pension and eased the means test. In 1946 the Chifley government won a referendum to add social services to the powers of the commonwealth government. Previously this had been a residual power of the states.‘In no sense reactionary’Menzies had to convince non-labour to embrace an expanded role for government in managing the economy and providing welfare, while distinguishing the new party from Labor. This is the meaning of the oft-quoted explanation in his memoir Afternoon Light: “We took the name ‘Liberal’ because we were determined to be a progressive party, willing to make experiments, in no sense reactionary but believing in the individual, his rights and his enterprise, and rejecting the socialist panacea.”View image in fullscreenRobert Menzies bids farewell to Queen Elizabeth II at Canberra Aerodrome in 1954.Photograph: Fox Photos/Getty ImagesIt came down to a question of balance. Apart from a few prewar radical socialists and communists, both sides ofAustralian politicshave always supported private property and a mixed economy. Where they have differed, and still do, is over the balance between private and public provision, between the role of the market and the role of government or the state, in the distribution of resources.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBy the end of the 1940s the Labor and Liberal parties shared a commitment to full employment, to expanded welfare provision, and to government-led economic development, through immigration, tariff protection for new secondary industries, such as cars and white goods, and ambitious infrastructure projects like the Snowy Mountains scheme. Where they differed was over the extent of government planning, regulation and ownership: Labor for more, Liberals for less. Menzies labelled Labor’s greater commitment to government planning socialism.The postwar consensus between Labor and Liberal on an active, expansive role for government lasted until the middle of the 1970s when western economies began to suffer from stagflation – the combination of high inflation and high unemployment which defied Keynesian solutions. New ideas started to circulate among policymakers. Neoliberalism was born, with its argument for a new balance between government and the market in the distribution of resources, which, it was argued, would free up the productivity-enhancing powers of competitive markets and return western economies to growth.Its remedies were to reduce government spending, deregulate government-controlled markets, privatise government-owned enterprises and contract out the delivery of government-funded services.Neoliberal consensusBy the 1980s a new neoliberal consensus was forming between Labor and Liberal that government’s role in the economy needed to be wound back. Much to the Liberal party’s chagrin, it was Labor that took the lead in implementing these new ideas. Coalition prime minister Malcolm Fraser was not convinced by neoliberalism though many Liberals were, including his treasurer, John Howard. Fraser lost the 1983 election to Labor.View image in fullscreenMalcolm Fraser, centre, and then treasurer, John Howard, right, in 1981.Photograph: The Sydney Morning Herald/Fairfax Media/Getty ImagesOver the next 13 years, Labor implemented much of the neoliberal agenda and restructured Australia’s protected, highly regulated economy. The dollar was floated, foreign banks were allowed in, protective tariffs were progressively dismantled, government owned enterprises were sold off, government provided services were contracted out. Much of this was supported by the Coalition, and then implemented by it after it returned to government in 1996.Again it was a question of balance and degree. The Coalition wanted faster and more comprehensive deregulation of the labour market in particular and the curbing of union power. And it wanted faster privatisation of Australia’s monopoly telecommunications provider, Telecom. In this it was held back by its Coalition partner, the Nationals, who have always argued that services to the bush should be subsidised. Labor, on the other hand, paired its support for market mechanisms in determining the distribution of resources with a strengthening of what it called the social wage.The centre piece of this was Medicare, a new national health scheme, which the Coalition opposed all the way, as it had the version introduced by the Whitlam government as Medibank. It was not until 1995 that John Howard, in his second stint as Liberal leader, abandoned the Coalition’s opposition. This was not because of conviction but electoral pragmatism. By then Medicare was bedded down and a clear electoral asset for Labor on the side of government action, as it has continued to be.Sussan Ley pushes for new collaborative policy process in bid to avoid Peter Dutton-style party controlRead moreJust as in the 1940s, a shift in the public’s expectations of government is under way, and non-labour must adapt to stay relevant. The neoliberal reform agenda has had its day. Its core reforms have been largely implemented, and some negative consequences are now evident, especially in the delivery of services, funded but no longer provided by government, which have endemic problems with negligence and fraud. Neoliberalism was always an elite-led policy agenda with weak popular support, especially in Australia, which has historically had high levels of government provision.Now, as the problems facing the contemporary world have mounted up, so have the demands on government to solve them. The Labor government’s introduction of the National Insurance Disability Scheme and the ageing population have increased demand for government-funded services. The unstable strategic environment is pushing up defence spending. The energy transition away from fossil fuels needs decisive government leadership. And the inevitable disasters from the changes to the climate already baked in will put enormous demands on governments for emergency responses, for compensation for the destruction of property, some of which will no longer be insurable, and for adaptation, such as shifting whole communities out of flood plains to higher ground. The climate emergency we face is as threatening to life and property as the threat of Japanese invasion was in the early 1940s, in fact more so.View image in fullscreenJohn Howard and deputy leader Andrew Peacock in 1987.Photograph: The Sydney Morning Herald/Fairfax Media/Getty ImagesPrima facie, as the party that has historically favoured more active government, Labor is better placed to meet these challenges.Complicating this challenge, for both sides of politics, Australian society today is much more complex than it was in Menzies’ day. Then, the main differences a government had to manage were between the working and middle classes, workers and business, country and city, and sectarian divisions between Catholics and Protestants. The three main parties were clearly linked to visible features of the society and economy.Now, largely because of the postwar migration program, Labor and the Liberals must compete for the votes of a diverse range of ethnic and religious communities which do not fall naturally to either. Adding to this complexity is the expansion of the political agenda to include difficult and hard-fought differences over Indigenous issues, the environment and questions of gender and sexuality. When Menzies evoked the family home he could assume it was a taken-for-granted consensual symbol. This was no longer the case when, in 1988, John Howard put a blond nuclear family on the cover of Future Direction, the policy agenda of his first stint as Liberal leader which sank like a stone.History and culture warsJohn Howard’s political genius was to shift the focus of the difference between Labor and Liberal away from the economic, where they largely agreed, to cultural and social questions about gender, multiculturalism, race and competing understandings of settler-Indigenous history. As Liberal leader and as prime minister, Howard skilfully used the so-called history and culture wars to the advantage of the Coalition, and subsequent leaders were carried along in his slipstream. A moderate like Malcolm Turnbull made no lasting impact and Peter Dutton was a clumsy imitation.View image in fullscreen‘A number of times in her address to the press club, Ley promised to listen to young people, where support for the Liberal party has collapsed.’Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPBut, as is evident in the Liberal party’s historic loss of metropolitan electorates, the culture and history wars no longer work for it. In fact they have become a major handicap. Not only does the party have a problem with women, especially professional women, but also with non-white immigrants and their children, of whom there are increasing numbers in the electorate. As many commentators have noted, Dutton made a disastrous misinterpretation of the defeat of the voice referendum, concluding that it was mainly about race when it was actually about the Australian electorate’s habitual scepticism of the benefits of constitutional change.A number of times in her address to the press club, Ley promised to listen to young people, where support for the Liberal party has collapsed. And she recognised that unaffordable housing was a challenge to their dreams for their future lives. Once one could get ahead by hard work and saving, buy a home, start a business or a family. But for many of today’s young people the traditional foundation of an adult life, home ownership, is out of reach, no matter how much they aspire to it and how much they work, unless of course they have access to family capital. House prices have grown so much faster than wages, and income is taxed more heavily than capital or wealth.So here is some advice. If the Liberals want to make aspiration a core value, they need to commit to radical tax reform and to start taxing wealth. Even if they argue for an overall reduction of the government’s share of GDP, if their core value of aspiration is to have any meaning in contemporary Australia, they need to rebalance the tax take of income and capital so that it is possible to get ahead by hard work, as it was in Menzies’ day. And they need to stare down the inevitable indignant roars of wealthy older Australians whose wealth is the result of asset inflation as much as effort and enterprise.Judith Brett is a political historian and biographer, and an emeritus professor of politics at La Trobe University.

Crap, I mean, in quite a specific sense: we might not be teetering on the brink of civilisational destruction, as the post-Brexit right can often seem to think. But there nonetheless remains a vast, ambient sense of rubbishness. Everything is expensive but nothing works. Our streets are full of potholes; our houses arefull of mould. All the shops are shut, except for a Tesco Express, where there are security tags on the eggs. It takes about a million years to build a railway line.Up to now, the response to Britain’s enshittification has, by and large, seemed remarkably fatalistic: Keir Starmer spent the first year in government repeatedly insisting that there just wasn’t any money, and so really nothing could be done. Thank God then, one might think, forLooking for Growth, a new campaign group led by young (well, late 20s, early 30s) Londoners Lawrence Newport and Joe Reeve, who have reportedly been advised by Dominic Cummings, and who have taken it on themselves torid the tubeof the scourge of graffiti.You might haveseen the video: riding the Bakerloo line, wearing hi-vis jackets that proclaim they are “Doing What Sadiq Khant” and accompanied by the GB News presenter Tom Harwood, for some reason, Looking for Growth perform a task that looks so simple only a government might fail to achieve it – apply a bit of spray and a bit of elbow grease – to rid some rolling stock of a litany of ugly tags and scrawls (“It’s not evengoodgraffiti!”, Harwood exclaims). “This is shameful. This is not OK. We’re done waiting for @MayorofLondon to pull his finger out,” atweet by Reeveexplained.It’s certainly proved an effective publicity stunt, but what exactly are Looking for Growth, and its backers, attempting to drum up publicityfor? The campaigners would like to be known as a “pro-growth” and “anti-crime”group who defy the traditional left-right political spectrum. However, as aLondon Centric piece about the groupclaims, they often reference the French political meme “Nicolas, 30 ans” that depicts a young professional struggling as he pays taxes toward an older bourgeois couple and a younger immigrant.Reeve is quoted as saying, “That probably does describe quite a lot of our members.”Looking for Growth members appear to balance their pessimism about the present state of things with an optimism about what we might broadly call “tech-driven” solutions: thevideo displayedon the front page of their website features an image of Michelangelo’s God from The Creation of Adam, touching a robot arm. Londoncentric describes many of Looking for Growth’s members as “tech sector-adjacent”; predictably perhaps, their tube clean-up video was retweeted by Elon Musk.View image in fullscreenJoe Reeve of Looking for Growth cleaning graffiti on a Bakerloo line carriage.Photograph: LFGWhat might we say about all this? Certainly there is a powerful vision here. Britainiscrap – and people know it. Mainstream politiciansreally don’tseem to be able to do anything about it: hence why there is clearly so much electoral space for parties not called “Labour” or “the Conservatives” to exploit. But the likes of Looking for Growth seem to be entirely mistaken about the nature of Britain’s enshittification.Take graffiti, for instance. TfL has claimed that it’s unable to hold back carriages for cleaning and replace them with backups due to government budget cuts, but even if graffiti reallyweresome sort of permanent, intractable problem on the tube – would the mere existence of graffiti be what’s making Britain crap? Granted: part of how we know Britain is crap is because itlookscrap. Still more profound, surely, is what we might call our sense ofinstitutionalcrappiness manifested in the fact that all of our transactions are mediated through apps, but then if anything goes wrong you’re only able to “talk to” an AI, never an actual human being. It’s expensive and shoddy housing. Crappiness is an elevated utilities bill;crappiness is shrinkflation.In short, the more we think about how Britain is actually crap, the more we can think about who is actually responsible for its decline. This is stuff being done to us by the venture capitalists who seem to own all our strategic assets; the private landlords we decided to sell all our social housing stock to. It is stuff being done to us by big tech. If anyoneactuallywants to make anything better, it’s those much grander forces we’re going to need to find a way of scrubbing off our metaphorical walls.Tom Whyman is an academic philosopher and a writerExplore more on these topicsSocietyOpinionCrimeDominic CummingsLondon UndergroundInequalityElon MuskLondoncommentShareReuse this content"

That’s not the way civilised countries do democracyFri 27 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 09.04 EDTShareLook at the coverage of any general election opinion polling recently and what you are likely to see is a map of Britain divided into its constituencies and covered in Reform’s light blue. They are utterly dominant when it comes to the projected seats. Take the latestYouGov MRP poll, published with great fanfare this week. MRP (multilevel regression and poststratification) is a particularly detailed kind of poll that creates projections for each constituency – and this one predicted that Nigel Farage’s party would win a whopping 42% of the seats inside the House of Commons if a general election were held now. Even this was fairly low compared with some other recent data that actually projecteda majority of 30 seats.But while Farage and some parts of the media really want you to focus on the number of seats Reform might win, what you should be looking at is what the data is actually telling us. Stay with me on this. Because, while the latest YouGov poll may show Reform achieving 42% of UK seats, the proportion of people in the UK who actually support them, according to that same poll, is only 26%. What we really should be taking from the latest data is the headline “three-quarters of UK votersdon’twant Nigel Farage and Reform”. Only one in four people want them in government.When you think about it like this, the ridiculousness of the current system is laid bare. This party is unpopular with most of the voters, yet the question on Westminster watchers’ lips is: “Can they win a majority?” This warps the discourse around our entire political system and creates the impression that most of the public want something that they self-evidently don’t.If you need more convincing as to how the UK’s first-past-the-post system is spinning politics to the extremes, take a look at the part of the UK where Reform are polling even better – Wales. Recent polls in Wales have shown Reform and Plaid Cymru vying for first place ahead of the Senedd (Welsh parliament) elections next year.The latest pollputs Reform in first place with 29%.But in Wales there is no genuine conversation (outside the Reform party itself) about Reform really being able to form a government next year. And why is this? It is because in Cymru we have a system that is far more proportional. There is simply no way that any party can come close to a majority with less than a third of the vote. Call me crazy, but in a democracy, doesn’t that make sense?Let me give you an example. Ina poll at the start of Maylooking at voting intentions in Wales, Plaid Cymru got 30% and Reform UK 25%. When it came to seat projections inside the Senedd (which has 96 seats), Plaid was projected about 35 and Reform 30. This is broadly reflective of the numbers of people who would have voted for them. So Reform could easily be the largest party in Wales next year. I think it will be. But there is still very little chance of it forming a government for the plain and simple reason that its politics are miles away from the views of most people in Wales.Inside the Senedd there are six parties who can realistically win seats: Plaid,Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, the Conservatives and Reform. All those first four parties have categorically ruled out working with Farage. The only party that would do so is the Tories, but all the evidence suggests that most of Reform’s gains are coming at their expense. So the better Reform does, the smaller is its only prospective coalition partner likely to be. This is the benefit of proportional democracy in action: it stops extremes guiding the agenda.Imagine you and 12 mates are going out. Three of you want to go have a cappuccino, three want lattes and three want flat whites. You all want coffee but can’t quite agree on which specific one, but broadly you are in agreement on what you want to do. But imagine that the remaining four want to go out to get battered on Special Brew and smash up a bar. Under first-past-the-post, because there are more people wanting Special Brew than cappuccino, lattes or flat whites respectively, you are all condemned to go out on the piss.Under the Welsh setup, and frankly those of most healthy democratic systems (like those in New Zealand, Finland and Norway), the direction of the nation is as close as possible to the view of most of its people, not simply the largest minority. Whereas the UK as a whole is going to be forced to go out on the lash by Reform even though they really want a nice cup of coffee.If Keir Starmer really wants to counter Reform, he needs to change an electoral process that punishes parties for having broad appeal. It’s the single biggest change he can make as prime minister that will stop the hard right seizing power. Will he have the courage to do away with a system that gave his own party63% of the seats on just 34% of the vote? I doubt it. But if he is serious about putting country over party, he must.Will Hayward is a Guardian columnist.

Why is the government always so poor at reading the room?Fri 27 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 06.47 EDTShareWill this disaster bill pass on Tuesday? Thedangerous obduracyof the prime minister and chancellor confirms precisely what Labour MPs say: they haven’t listened, they aren’t really listening and the fear is they won’t learn to listen. Even after Thursday’sraft of concessions, and even if the bill is squeezed through withfurther softening, it will be a pyrrhic victory. Why take such a risk for so little? U-turns are better than crashes, but best not left to the last nanosecond.Senior ministers, some of whom have already spoken up in cabinet, will put their feet down firmly to insist on radical alteration, or better still that it’s withdrawn and rethought to avoid what they call “this catastrophe”. If niceties of parliamentary practice escape some, understand how extraordinary this rebellion is. Read their “reasoned amendment” with its crushing reasons why.Voting for this amendment would kill the bill stone-dead, as it means the bill will not have a second reading. Finito. Who put the amendment forward? Grandee of the chamber Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the powerful Treasury select committee. She’s so respected for her chairing of the public accounts committee that, unusually, she was elected unopposed. She alsochairs the liaison committee, the grand committee of all chairs that regularly grills the prime minister. Hillier has now climbed down following changes, but the damage has been done. TenLabour committee chairsjoined her among the 126 signers, backed by theLondonmayor.Keir Starmer unwisely dismissed them as the usual “noises off”, but they are noise he needs to hear. A few are his longtime opponents but, for most, mutiny is a mortally serious matter. That’s not from fear of whips’ retribution or expulsion (there’s safety in numbers), but because they know how destructive this is to their government less than a year in power, after aeons in the wilderness. As a parliamentary candidate, each Labour MP signed a pledge to support their party in parliament in exchange for wearing the Labour rosette: they owe the party everything. Taking this drastic step, they are motivated by the serious harm this bill does to all on disability benefits in their constituencies, but they also do it to save the government from seriously damaging itself.A bad bill, hastily put together, propels 250,000 people with disabilities into poverty, along with 50,000 children (maybe more when all assessments are in). The initial rationale sounds convincing: claims for personal independence payments (Pip) can’t keepgrowing at 1,000 a day. But “moral” pleas for the fate of disabled people “trapped” on benefits who want to work but lack support fail to sound anything but disingenuous. Taking a crude machete to benefits because the Office for Budget Responsibility suddenly found a £5bn gap in Treasury accounts is no way to solve it. Nor was it the plan of Liz Kendall and Alison McGovern, who have long talked upemployment supportinto good jobs with new work coaches plus their youth guarantee, not expecting this last-minute thunderclap from the Treasury.It’s unsellable, try as they might, even to British voters who tend to be ungenerous: welfare and foreign aid vie for unpopularity. But an axe to funds for disabled people? Polling from More in Common finds 44% of Britons think that welfare reforms aretoo harshand only 10% too lenient (Kemi Badenoch’s forlorn position). A majority think this is purely cost-cutting, not motivated by support for vulnerable people. Cabinet ministers have been sent out, like lambs to the slaughter, to defend it on the airwaves and each has a list of MPs to call. Any success, I ask a senior one? “No, none, not one, even at my most persuasive.” What’s more, they report that many Labour MPs not signing the amendment are as strongly opposed to the bill as the signers. Talking to MPs, I find less anger than an ache for the error.Here’s the tragedy for Labour supporters. Broadcasters have taken to referring to the cuts as “Labour’s flagship bill”, which of course it isn’t. But it risks defining the government, instead of its far more significant actions. I observed Rachel Reeves on Tuesday as shevisited Elaine primary schoolin Rochester, Kent, to talk about free school meals and Labour policies for poor children, both now and to come. She joined the dinner ladies handing out meat, roast potatoes, cabbage and carrots with lashings of gravy, plus chocolate brownies.The chancellor was also handing out her message to local TV reporters, rattling it off impressively in one interview after another. Free school meals, when rolled out to all on universal credit, will lift 100,000 children out of poverty, saving parents £500 per child each year. New uniform rules cut costs. Of course Labour will fulfil its manifesto promise to raise many more children out of poverty in this parliament: wait for the autumn child poverty review. The national living wage rose by 7%. Investment post-austerity means£20bn to expandthe schools building programme over the next decade. NHS waiting listsare falling. This week the prime minister announced £150 off energy bills for anextra 2.7m households.The Labour welfare rebels are right. This hounding of disabled people will damage the party for years to come | Frances RyanRead moreThere’s plenty more in Labour’s good record. Reevesraised £40bnin tax from businesses and the rich – far bolder, in worse circumstances, than Blair and Brown’s first year. She gave the NHS most, early-years education gets a boost and her spending review’s better borrowing rules open the gates to huge capital investment, especially on green energy and nuclear reactors. Some rail is nationalised withsteel potentially to follow. But a newtrade strategyon Thursday, along with this week’s excellentindustrial strategy, sink under the weight of this obstinate error.To steal a phrase, the evil this government does gets emblazoned on front pages, the good is oft interred on page 93. That’s because its actions fail to coalesce into an identity, risking the government being defined by others and by its own errors. The qualities of no-drama Starmer and iron chancellor Reeves were the essential sober stabilisers in recovery from Corbynism, but now they need political theatrics to explain what they are about. Last time, on winter fuel allowances, they didn’t move until far too late. This last-minute swerve suggests no lessons learned.In Reeves’s chat with Rochester children, one asked: “Do you like raising taxes?” In effect, her answer was yes, as she explained what good things taxes pay for. But I doubt she would be pleased that you can now hear senior ministers wanting more of them, flying kites for more radicalism, pondering why the highly paid haven’t been asked for more, and ways wealth taxes might work. Pressing ahead is folly, but even now, that seems the intention. Running towards a brick wall.

Yet its message to those who want to come to Germany toworkis: we need you.This might sound like a contradiction, but it is a revival of the thinking that drove the “guest worker” programme of the postwar boom years. Between 1955 and 1973, WestGermanysought to rebuild its economy by attracting labour, mainly from Turkey but also from Italy, Portugal and Yugoslavia. Yet it did so without giving much consideration to the human needs of the people coming.Repeating that experiment, and the social tensions it created, at this moment would be even worse.TheWirtschaftswunder(economic miracle) fuelled record growth and labour shortages. Now, Germany’s economy is in recession, but it desperately needs people to fulfil basic public services. Above all, it needs them to help finance its mounting pensions bill.Given that Germany has also become ground zero for Europe’s heightened sensitivity around immigration after the backlash that followedAngela Merkel’s open-door policytowards Syrian refugees a decade ago, it’s worth paying attention to how Berlin navigates the issue. So far, Merz is providing a masterclass in what not to do.On the one hand, the conservative chancellor is fuelling rightwing narratives that suggest migration is a threat to the country. On the other, he speaks as the voice of German business and pleads for more foreign workers.“We need skilled immigrants as drivers of progress,”Merz saidthis month, at a ceremony to honour the contributions of Özlem Türeci and Uğur Şahin – the Turkish immigrants behind Covid vaccine pioneer BioNTech. He added that anti-immigration “ideologies” were a threat not just to Germany’s prosperity “but even worse, their narrow-mindedness threatens the future of our liberal order”.Germany needs a unifier. In Merz, it is getting a chancellor whose instincts are to divide | Chris Reiter and Will WilkesRead moreBut his government has sent exactly the kind of signal he claims to decry. Germany has continued with a new policy of rejecting asylum seekers at its borders, despite a court order calling itunlawful and a violation of EU law. The border rejections standoff comes despite a dramatic decline in refugees – up to April 2025, the figures were down bynearly halffrom the previous year.Another leg of Merz’s anti-migration strategy is to put anend to “turbo naturalisation”,which allows newcomers the opportunity to apply for a German passport after as little as three years in select cases. The official justification is that ending fast-track citizenship will eliminate a “pull factor” and reduce illegal migration.But obtaining citizenship and skirting migration rules have nothing to do with one another. Crossing the border as an irregular migrant can be an act of desperation, and at times opportunism. Getting a German passport requires legal residency at the very least, but also involves various hurdles and a significant amount of paperwork.The fast-track procedure is even more discretionary and reserved for people that exhibit “exceptional integration efforts”, such as speaking German at an advanced level, consistently paying taxes and taking part in the community, for example by volunteering at local charities or sports clubs.View image in fullscreenThe Turkish market in Kreuzberg, Berlin.Photograph: David Angel/AlamyEliminating that route, which only opened in June 2024, will have very little impact. Last year – when a rush to take advantage of the new process might have been expected – only about 7% of people receiving German citizenship had an accelerated application, according tofederal statistics agency Destatis.But Merz’s moves reinforce the narrative that Germany is being overwhelmed by newcomers. The approach bolsters the far-right AfD –a close second in the polls– which hascalled for the deportationof thousands of people, including some with migrant backgrounds who hold German citizenship.Controlling entry is legitimate, but such grandstanding policies fuel xenophobic sentiment and don’t allay the worries of anxious citizens. Also, the political dividends are limited.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Economic concerns such as inflation and poverty/inequality are the other top concerns.The harder-to-face reality is that Germany could use all the help it can get. With older Germans heading into retirementby the millionsover the coming decade, the country must welcome a net400,000 newcomerseach year to keep things balanced and shoulder the rising cost of pensions.But this isn’t the postwar era, where Germany can sign agreements with poorer countries and expect thousands to arrive. There’s global competition for qualified workers, and Germany is at a disadvantage because of its language and its reputation for being unwelcoming.That’s a legacy from the mismanagedGastarbeiter(guest worker) programme, when Germany had neither a plan for how to integrate the people it lured for work, nor the desire to do so. It also reflects a national identity left narrow and underdeveloped due to its Nazi past.The former footballer Mesut Özil, born in 1988 to a Turkish guest-worker family in Germany’s Ruhr Valley, never felt fully accepted. Though he played a starring role in Germany’s 2014 World Cup win, he said: “When we win, I’m German; when we lose, I’m a foreigner.”His story shows how acceptance is out of reach for many. And it’s not isolated. Accordingto a recent studyby the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, between 2015 and 2022, 12 million people migrated to Germany. The study also said that, in the same period, more than 7 million migrants left again. The main reasons were difficulties feeling part of German society.The next blow could be looming. According to a study byGermany’s Institute for Employment Research, a quarter of migrants in the country – around 2.6 million people – are considering packing up and leaving.Germany’s self-imposed isolation will lead to a slow erosion of the labour force unless it is urgently addressed. Revising the narrative around migration to recast it as part of the solution would be a good starting point.But the political class hardly looks ready.

Now the TV series Dying for Sex gives caregiving the value it deservesThu 26 Jun 2025 20.18 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 02.41 EDTShareWhen I started watching the Disney+ showDying for Sex, I was wary that the cancer storyline might hit a bit too close to home, after our teenage son was diagnosed with cancer in 2022.The series follows Molly (Michelle Williams) who decides to leave her marriage and pursue sexual pleasure after being diagnosed with stage four cancer. And yet while it’s a difficult watch for obvious reasons, it wasn’t the “cancer stuff” that hit me where it hurts (everywhere); it was the portrayal of Nikki (Jenny Slate), Molly’s best friend, who takes over as carer when Molly leaves her husband. Nikki loses her job, her relationship, her house, her own mental health. And it’s very rare that we see the role of a carer highlighted in pop culture in this way.When I took my son to emergency with odd symptoms, I initially assumed I’d miss a day or two of work. That was over two years ago. My work computer still has a tab open from Googling his symptoms and a Slack message saying I’d be offline for the rest of the day. I haven’t been back to the office since. And our landlord did what landlords do and landlorded so hard (increased our already staggeringly high rent) that we had to find affordable, wheelchair-accessible housing in the middle of a rental crisis while our lives imploded.‘I’ve never masturbated on film before’: Michelle Williams’ orgasm odyssey in Dying for SexRead moreWhat Slate’s portrayal of Nikki does is give caregiving the value it deserves. We see the duality of care, how she does so imperfectly, but from a place of deep-seated love, not obligation or duty, and yet we also see the cracks form as she faces the reality of the tasks she has to perform.One day at hospital, I had forgotten to put my mask on as I walked back inside. One of our son’s very senior doctors, who had only ever seen me from the bridge of my nose up, looked at my face, seemingly baffled, and said, looking right at me: “You’re not Natasha.” It took a while for me to realise there was a disconnect between how he imagined I looked versus how I actually looked without a mask. But before I registered that, there was a weird moment where it sounded like a prophecy. I was no longer me. Because that’s how I felt. On many days, as the physical and mental toll renders me a hollowed-out version of my former self, I hear his words echo back to me.You’re not Natasha.We deal with everything by leaning into the absurdity of our situation. And although what we have to endure individually and collectively as a family is always too much on any given day, there is grace and humour and a ridiculous number of memes. And this, I suppose, is also what I loved about Molly and Nikki’s relationship. There is heartache and devastation but also beauty and laughter, and above all else, friendship. It’s hard to reconcile that while as parents we desperately wish we could give our son his health back, we also feel the very real privilege of the time we get to spend with him each day that we wouldn’t otherwise.View image in fullscreenNikki (Jenny Slate), Molly’s best friend, takes over as carer.Photograph: Sarah Shatz/FXMy husband and I do not possess any special qualities that have prepared us for our new roles as carers. We are not special. And this is the point.There are 3 million unpaid carers in Australia. Caring for siblings, for parents, for friends, for children. Some caring for multiple people at the same time. Some do so out of choice and some have no choice. Some balance paid work, some do not. All are forced into systems that exist to seemingly help the chronically sick and disabled but actually create barriers to accessing help and place further burdens on carers and the people they care for. The 2024 Carer Wellbeing Survey found carers are being left behind in most of the key indicators of wellbeing including loneliness, psychological distress and financial hardship. Being a carer is not exceptional, though we may have to do so in exceptional circumstances.‘I could never, ever not care for her’: how do carers know when to stop caring for those they love?Read moreWhen our son was first discharged from hospital, and the reality of his complex medical needs hit, I joined a Facebook group for carers, assuming I would find some tips and tricks. But instead, each day was a barrage of posts, desperate carers asking for help. “I’m at breaking point ... ”, “I don’t know what to do ... ”, “I can’t go on like this ...” It seemed I was doing everything right then: existing at breaking point was part of the job description.There is a Post-it note on my laptop placed there by my husband: “Best Mum!” He has a habit of hiding notes around the house that I always happen to find exactly when I need them. “Keep it up!” they say. “You’re doing so well!” I think of the doctor and the look on his face when he said: “You’re not Natasha.” I add another Post-it to my laptop. “Remember who the fuck you are,” I write in thick black sharpie.What we’re doing feels impossible. And sometimes we need to see ourselves reflected back to us (in books, on the screen) to remind ourselves that we are doing this important, beautiful, impossible thing.Natasha Sholl is a writer and lapsed lawyer living in Melbourne.

Ahead of a Glastonbury appearance deemed ‘inappropriate’ by Keir Starmer, they argue the backlash against them is a deliberate distractionFri 27 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 05.09 EDTShareIn April, the Irish-language rap trioKneecapperformed two sets at Coachella, the California music festival attended by 250,000 people. As is commonplace at the group’s shows, Kneecap displayed a message stating: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,” and the words “Fuck Israel. Free Palestine”. Mo Chara, one of the group’s members, told the audience: “The Palestinians have nowhere to go. It’s their fucking home and they’re bombing them from the skies. If you’re not calling it a genocide, what the fuck are you calling it?”Within a week, Kneecap’s US booking agent had dropped them, Fox News had likened the statements to “Nazi Germany”, a handful of summer shows had been cancelled, and two videos from 2023 and 2024 had resurfaced of the group on stage saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory,” and “Up Hezbollah, up Hamas”. The former statement attracted criticism from the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and David Amess, leading the band to apologise – “we never intended to cause you hurt” – and to reject “any suggestion that we would seek to incite violence against any MP or individual”. While saying “we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah”, they also described the recirculation of the videos as a “smear campaign” against them, with the footage “deliberately taken out of all context”.British counter-terrorism police announced they were investigating the band over alleged pro-terrorist sentiment expressed in the video, and later charged Mo Chara with terror offences for allegedly brandishing the flag of Hezbollah – which in the UK is a proscribed terrorist organisation – after someone from the crowd handed it to him during a November 2024 London show. In response, artists including Massive Attack, Paul Weller and Primal Scream signed a letter advocating for free speech and alleging that Kneecap were victims of a “campaign of intimidation”.Two months after Coachella, and as they prepare for a Glastonbury festival appearance that has been criticised by among others, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, and the leader of the Commons, Lucy Powell, the band say they are unfazed by the uproar. “Maybe visas get revoked, you’re not allowed in America again, it’s not ideal – but Jesus Christ, there’s people being bombed from the fucking skies, and people being starved to death,” says Mo Chara, AKA Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh. “We’re in the process [of applying for new visas], hopefully it works. But if it doesn’t, I can go about my day without having to worry about my next meal or my family being bombed. Visa revoked, I can get over.”View image in fullscreenMo Chara (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh) leaving Westminster magistrates court on 18 June.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Getty ImagesDo the band regret what’s depicted in either of the widely circulated videos? “It’s ajoke. I’m acharacter. Shit is thrown on stage all the time. If I’m supposed to know every fucking thing that’s thrown on stage” – in this case a Hezbollah flag – “I’d be in Mensa, Jesus Christ,” says Ó hAnnaidh. “I don’t know every proscribed organisation – I’ve got enough shit to worry about up there. I’m thinking about my next lyric, my next joke, the next drop of a beat.”And the “dead Tory” comments? “Why should I regret it? It was a joke – we’re playing characters, it’s satirical, it’s afucking joke. And that’s not the point,” he says. “The point is, that [video] wasn’t an issue until we said ‘Free Palestine’ at Coachella. That stuff happened 18 months ago, and nobody batted an eyelid. Everybody agreed it was a fucking joke, even people that may have been in the room that didn’t agree – it’s a laugh, we’re all having a bit of craic. The point is, and the context is, it all [resurfaced] because of Coachella. That’s what we should be questioning, not whether I regret things.”Kneecap’s opponents, he says, “went and combed through eight years of a career … they’re really scraping the bottom of the barrel”. He says that they then “took those videos out of context. If you believe that what a satirical band who play characters on stage do is more outrageous than the murdering of innocent Palestinians, then you need to give your head a fucking wobble.”To suggest that parts of Kneecap’s performance are satire and others aren’t is a tricky and potentially confusing line to walk. But Ó hAnnaidh argues the band don’t risk undermining their activism by blurring these lines. “It’s not our job to tell people what’s a joke and what’s not. Our job is: we make music as a band. We are going to have political messaging in our songs – it’s not for us to dissect it for other people. Take what you want from it, but we’re not going to change in that way.”Kneecap have granted only one interview prior to their Glastonbury performance, and over the course of an hour-long video call – Ó hAnnaidh, and DJ Próvai, AKA JJ Ó Dochartaigh, speaking from Lurgan, and Móglaí Bap, AKA Naoise Ó Cairealláin, from his home in Belfast – all stay staunchly on message. The controversy surrounding them, they reiterate, is not the story – Gaza is. “We’re a distraction, to take away [attention] from what’s happening in Palestine, especially for our generation of people who are always on our phones,” says Ó Cairealláin. “It’s all being livestreamed – you can never say you didn’t know what’s happening in Palestine, and that’s why they want to bog us down and go through old videos. Over 100 people were killed in the last four days – that’s the real story.” He alleges that the US and the UK “are complicit in this genocide” on the grounds that each country has sent military supplies to Israel, and that Israel’s supporters are targeting the band because they want to move the news “away from the arms support”.View image in fullscreenKneecap at the Bowery Ballroom in New York, October 2023.Photograph: Rolling Stone/Getty ImagesKneecap say that resistance is in their blood. Ó hAnnaidh and Ó Cairealláin are from west Belfast, while Ó Dochartaigh is from Derry; rapping in Irish is a way, they say, to reclaim a sense of Irish identity that the British attempted to stamp out. While they satirically self-identify as “Republican hoods” and “Fenian cunts” in their cartoonish, lewd music, their message is less republican than it is anticolonial and anti-sectarian. Kneecap advocate for peace between unionists and republicans – “the people on the ‘other side’ aren’t our enemy … we’re all working-class”, Ó hAnnaidhtold the Facelast year – and train their fury towards the 800 years of British rule in Ireland.Because of this, as well as their frequent references to drugs, the group have been criticised by unionist and republican advocates alike, as well as by Kemi Badenoch last year, who, when serving as UK business secretary, tried to block Kneecap from receiving a government-funded Music Export Growth Scheme grant because they “oppose the United Kingdom”.Kneecap won a subsequent discrimination lawsuitagainst the British government, and donated the grant money to Protestant and Catholic youth organisations in Northern Ireland. This week, the band released The Recap, a furious, gloating diss track aimed at Badenoch, in which they describe the grant money as reparations.The Recap – KneecapIt was around the time Kneecap sued the government that they caught the attention of Hasan Piker, a streamer and political commentator who the New York Times recently termed “a Joe Rogan of the left” due to his enormous platform and influence (he is one of the most viewed streamers on Twitch). He describes Kneecap to me as “uncompromising and unyielding in their commitment to anti-imperialism”. After it was announced that Kneecap’s second Coachella set wouldn’t be livestreamed, he offered to stream the show on his Twitch channel, which has more than2.9m followers. “I’m always impressed when I see anyone in the western world share this kind of sentiment,” he says. “At no point did I feel like they were fearful or anything like that … their advocacy is about putting humanity first.”Kneecap’s rise has been steady since they debuted in 2017, and was bolstered by last year’s release of a self-titled Bafta-winning comedy film about their origins, starringMichael Fassbender and the group themselves. Politics aside, the music itself is a riot: bawdy and whip-smart, animated by ferocious beats, deftly slipping between trenchant political commentary and dazed odes to the joys of substance use.But it’s their anticolonial stance that has secured them legions of fans in places such as Aotearoa (New Zealand) and Australia, where they played to 10,000 fans at a free gig in Melbourne earlier this year. That stance is also why the band advocate so fiercely for Palestine, which they say they have been doing since they began making music. “Eight-hundred years of colonialism, it obviously does things to people up to the point where I don’t think the Irish people are willing to stand on the sidelines any more. The Irish people aren’t willing to let something like a genocide pass by without comment,” says Ó hAnnaidh, and in general, Irish artists – Kneecap, as well as peers such as Lankum, Fontaines DC and Sprints – have been more vocal about the Palestinian cause than British or American acts. “If we lose a few quid, we lose a bit of clout in a certain space, we don’t care – we know we’re doing the right thing, we know we’re on the right side of history.”Israel has been carrying out a full-scale military campaign on occupied Gaza for almost two years, an onslaught triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed. The UN has found Israel’s military actions to be consistent with genocide, while Amnesty International and others have claimed Israel has shown an “intent to destroy” the Palestinian people.At least 56,000 Palestiniansare now missing or dead, with studies at Yale and other universities suggesting the official tolls are being underestimated. (In July 2024,the Lancet medical journal estimatedthe true death toll at that point could be more than 186,000.) But away from Kneecap and other outspoken artists, across the creative industries as a whole relatively few have spoken about Gaza in such stark terms.“The genocide in Palestine is a big reason we’re getting such big crowds at our gigs, because we are willing to put that message out there,” says Ó hAnnaidh. “Mainstream media has been trying to suppress that idea about the struggle in Palestine. People are looking at us as, I don’t know, a beacon of hope in some way – that this message will not be suppressed. The music is one thing, but the message is a big part of why we’re getting across.”As working-class, early-career musicians, Kneecap have a lot more to lose by speaking out than more prominent artists, but Ó Cairealláin says this is beside the point. “You can get kind of bogged down talking about the people who aren’t talking enough or doing enough, but for us, it’s about talking about Palestine instead of pointing fingers,” he says. “There’s no doubt that there’s a lot of bands out there who could do a lot more, but hopefully just spreading awareness and being vocal and being unafraid will encourage them.”View image in fullscreenKneecap.Photograph: Peadar Ó GoillÓ Dochartaigh adds: “We just want to stop people being murdered. There’s people starving to death, people being bombed every day. That’s the stuff we need to talk about, not fucking artists.”There’s no doubt that Kneecap’s fearlessness when it comes to speaking about Palestine is a key part of their appeal for many: during a headline set at London’sWide Awake festival last month, days after Ó hAnnaidh was charged for support of a terror organisation, an estimated 22,000 people chanted along with their calls of “free, free Palestine”. And thousands showed up to their Coachella sets – which the band allege is why so many pro-Israel groups were quick to push back on them, despite the fact that they had been displaying pro-Palestine messages for such a long time.“We knew exactly that this was going to happen, maybe not to the extreme [level] that it has, but we knew that the Israeli lobbyists and the American government weren’t going to stand by idly while we spoke to thousands of young Americans who agree with us,” says Ó hAnnaidh. “They don’t want us coming to the American festivals, because they don’t want videos of young Americans chanting ‘free Palestine’ [even though] that is the actual belief in America. They just want to suppress it.”The support for the message, says Ó Dochartaigh is “all genders, all religions, all colours, all creeds. Everybody knows what’s happening is wrong. You can’t even try to deny it now – Israel’s government is just acting with impunity and getting away with it. Us speaking out is a small detail – it’s the world’s governments that need to do something about it.”Last week, Ó hAnnaidh made an appearance at Westminster magistrates court, during which he was unconditionally bailed with a hearing set for 20 August. Kneecap’s defence team, which includes criminal defence lawyer Gareth Peirce, who represented the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, has argued that the charge against Ó hAnnaidh was made after the six-month period in which such a terrorism offence would fall under the court’s jurisdiction.Hundreds of protesters – including Paul Weller – gathered at the entrance to the court, holding aloft Palestine flags and signs that said “Free Mo Chara”; a van, emblazoned with the slogan “More Blacks, More Dogs, More Irish, Mo Chara,” circled the block periodically. Rob and Kathleen, an older couple from Hayling Island, had shown up to “defend free speech, to support people who protest about genocide in Gaza,” said Rob. “We’re also here to support young people,” Kathleen added. “Old people have made a real mess of this world, and we are very sorry, and hopefully young people can get us out of this mess.”When asked by the BBC on Wednesday about Kneecap’s appearance at Glastonbury, festival organiser Emily Eavis said “we remain a platform for many, many artists … everyone is welcome here”. But there is still considerable opposition to their Saturday afternoon set. Earlier this week, Starmer said it wasn’t “appropriate” for the band to perform at the festival, while Badenoch said the BBC “should not be rewarding extremism” by televising the band’s set. (A BBC spokesperson told the Guardian that “whilst the BBC doesn’t ban artists, our plans will ensure that our programming will meet our editorial guidelines”.)How Northern Irish rap trio Kneecap rose to fame by subverting the TroublesRead moreAnd, earlier in the month, a leak exposed a letter sent to the organisers of Glastonbury in which a number of music industry heavyweights ask the festival to “question the wisdom of continuing to have [Kneecap] on the lineup”. The letter was signed by top agents from major live music agencies.​ That the letter wasn’t published publicly is a form of vindication for the trio, says Ó Cairealláin.“The fact that the letter was leaked changes things,” adds Ó hAnnaidh. “And I hope that these people regret it. I think they’re already starting to.”Kneecap play Glastonbury’s West Holts stage at 4pm on Saturday.This article was amended on 27 June 2025.

In truth, Cezanne had nothing to do with their choice of destination. But his mountain was the one thing my father knew of the region. He was three years into a four-year fine art degree (he painted portraits of the two of us daughters for his finals), steeped in painting and its history.When we landed at Marignane airport in nearby Marseille on 29 August 1989, a wildfire was ravaging the Sainte-Victoire, that celebrated mountain subject of so many of Cezanne’s works. In the tumult of the days that followed – our family unhoused, the mountain unrecognisable – my father hustled between estate agents with the sound of sirens ringing in his ears. “Cezanne must be turning in his grave,” he remembers one saying.In the 119 years since he died, Cezanne (no acute accent; it’s how he spelled it himself) has been crowned the father of modern art. It’s the lineage a host of disparate painters claimed in his wake. For Matisse he was “the father of us all” and for Picasso, “the mother who protects her children”. Futurists, cubists and fauvists felt the same. The symbolists said his was “pure painting”. And Gauguin, well: he bought six Cezannes when he was flush and only parted with them under duress when he wasn’t, having said, of the fabled Still Life with Fruit Dish from 1879-80, that he’d sooner sell everything he owned than lose it.View image in fullscreenCezanne’s L’Estaque Derrière Les Arbres (1878-79).Photograph: Mathieu Rabeau/RMN-GPAix, by contrast, has mostly been famous for hardly owning any Cezannes at all: first because it didn’t care to and then, when it was too late, because it couldn’t afford to. This summer the town celebratesCezanne 2025, a season dedicated to rewriting that story. The town set aside a budget of €26m for the full programme. This has included restoring and opening to the public the Bastide du Jas de Bouffan (the family’s country home of 40 years); the Lauves studio to the north; and the Bibémus quarries in the foothills of the Sainte-Victoire where Cezanne often worked. Also included is a major exhibition at the Musée Granet, which opens on 28 June, and reassembles for the first time works now housed in museums all over the world that Cezanne made in Aix; along with three other exhibitions in the town and a programme of live events. It is a family reunion.I have come back home to retrace Cezanne’s footsteps, literally, in a kind of reductionary process I liken to the expert restorers’ painstaking scraping off of decades of paint and paper on the walls of the old bastide. Growing up in Aix, “Cezanne” was a local lycée, “Bibémus” the rocks on which I learned to boulder, and the “Jas”, the neighbourhood in which I learned to drive. Returning to Aix, I want to walk where he walked to scrape these words back to their earlier meanings – to let these familiar landscapes be his once again.View image in fullscreenThe Bibémus quarry.Photograph: M. FraissetCezanne was born in 1839 in the old town centre. He lived in various homes in these narrow streets and, at 13, befriended the author Émile Zola on the school benches of the Collège Bourbon, now the Collège Mignet. His hatmaker father, Louis-Auguste, made so much money selling rabbit-skin wares (the big Aixois industry of his day) that he invested in a bank, in the process becoming even richer.When Cezanne was 20, his father purchased the bastide as a country retreat. From then on, and until his mother’s death in 1899, it would be what the president of the Société Paul Cezanne and co-curator of the exhibition, Denis Coutagne, calls “the centre of gravity” of Cezanne’s world. It is where he painted his first big works as a twentysomething, directly on to the decorative walls of the ground-floor Grand Salon.Recent restorations have revealed further Cezannes no one knew about – a scene of a port entrance he then partly painted over with a scene of a game of hide and seek. When the latter was removed to canvas by the home’s new owner, along with the Four Seasons and other famous panels, and sold on to museums, these fragments were simply papered over and forgotten about. In 1880, Louis-Auguste, who definitely viewed the property as something to boast about, nonetheless built Cezanne a studio: an enviably large room on the top floor, with a remarkably modern double-height window that bluntly interrupts the symmetry of the mansion’s facade. As Laforest puts it, that in itself puts paid to the myth that the father did not support the son’s endeavours.View image in fullscreenThe Bibémus quarry.Photograph: Courtesy of Dale Berning SawaI stand at the window. But for the military row of cypress trees forming an extra barrier inside the property wall to the right, I know the mountain is right there. On clear days, from the Jas, it appears as a perfect Matisse-like cutout in pale blue against a paler sky. Musée Granet director Bruno Ely, the other co-curator of the exhibition, tells me that the 1989 fire brought the Sainte-Victoire back to something closer to what Cezanne knew: the pine forest that was burning when I arrived is a 20th-century phenomenon. In the 19th century, all these hills were kept closely cropped by flocks of sheep.From the bastide to the Bibémus quarries takes about an hour and a half on foot. Cezanne would hitch a ride with a driver and a cart to get a bit closer, but once in what are now Aix’s north-eastern heights, he’d still have to walk an hour to reach the quarry. As I’m walking – from the bastide to the quarry to the dam Zola’s father built and down into Le Tholonet, where Cezanne lived later on; then back into town along the petite Route du Tholonet, which culture minister André Malraux had listed and renamed as the Route Cezanne in 1959 – I watch the mountain, this constant presence.View image in fullscreenLauves studio.Photograph: Sophie SpitériYou might say that the Mont Sainte-Victoire, as he called it, was to Cezanne what Rouen Cathedral was to Monet. However, his approach was completely at odds with the impressionists’. Monet recorded the changing light: it’s right there in the titles (“grey skies”, “sunshine”, “at sunset”). By contrast, Cezanne’s concerns, as Coutagne puts it, are “never documentary”, “never meteorological”, never about “the instant”. In 1876, Cezanne writes to a friend about olive trees having a greyish colour that is “permanent”. Matisse, Cezanne’s junior by 30 years, understood this. He wrote to a friend in 1918 that “the olive trees are so beautiful at this hour: the full light of day is magnificent, but frightening. I find that Cezanne conveyed it well, happily not in its brilliance, which is unbearable.” Light, sure, but not changing light; essential light.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

His allegiance to the supremely local isn’t about identifying with the place, but rather that every rock or tree or house he painted is one he saw. That specificity is what makes his work so profoundly, universally resonant.What makes Cezanne’s paintings so radical is how he arrived, as Coutagne puts it, “like a meteor … Nothing, no one prefigures him.” His oeuvre resolutely denies the illusion of all the figurative painting that came before him. It forces the viewer to reckon with his painted surface, to not be duped into thinking that said painting is a window on to the world.View image in fullscreenCezanne’s Still Life With Cherries and Peaches (1885-87).Photograph: Museum Associates/LACMA. GrandPalaisRmnCezanne’s Lauves studio, which he built in 1901, is a building site when I visit, inaccessible until later in the summer. Fresh apples have usually been displayed here, much like the fresh lemon left on a pewter plate in the Kettle’s Yard gallery in Cambridge, displayed to echo the yellow dot in Joan Miró’s Tic Tic, which hangs on the adjacent wall. But perhaps this is why I’ve never been much inclined to go inside the Lauves studio: with Cezanne, I want to seehisapples – that painted appleness – not fresh fruit. Virginia Woolf once wrote about her sister, Vanessa Bell, persuading John Maynard Keynes to lend them a tiny Cezanne he’d just bought – a 1878 still life of seven apples titled Pommes – because their friend Roger Fry wanted to copy it. “Nessa left the room and reappeared with a small parcel about the size of a large slab of chocolate. On one side are six [sic] apples by Cezanne. Roger very nearly lost his senses. I’ve never seen such a sight of intoxication. He was like a bee on a sunflower. Imagine … us all gloating upon these apples. They really are very superb.”I finish with a visit to Cezanne’s grave in the Saint-Pierre Cemetery. I add a pebble to a few already perched on its aged surface and think about Patti Smith. Her A Book of Days is filled with Polaroids of the headstones of authors she’s visited: Rimbaud, Camus, Woolf, Jean Genet. While you can buy a novel for a tenner or read it for free at a library, visiting a writer’s grave offers something else, something closer to the unique experience of holding a handwritten manuscript or seeing where the writer sat to write it. A painter’s grave though? Standing here, I am both moved and left wanting. It’s his actual paintings I want to see. And to see Cezanne originals, you normally have to go on a grand tour, a modern-day pilgrimage, to the big museums of the world. This July, they are, remarkably, all coming to Aix. So I’m heading home again this summer to see those, too.Cezanne at Jas De Bouffan is at Musée Granet, Aix-en-Provence, France, from 28 June to 12 October.Explore more on these topicsPaul CezanneArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What makes directing a job for life?Fri 27 Jun 2025 10.17 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 10.34 EDTShareIf life behaved in the same way as movies, thenThe Fabelmanswould have been Steven Spielberg’s last film. He spent the previous five decades writing the rulebook of modern cinema, and then The Fabelmans was the rare work of art that wrapped everything up with a neat little bow. Part autobiography and part tutorial, it was like the work of a man looking back on his life with a sense of satisfied completion.But real life doesn’t behave like that, and Spielberg has just announced that he is never going to retire. In fact, he announced it twice. In a speech he gave during a star-studded event unveiling a newSteven SpielbergTheater on the Universal lot last night, the 78-year-old said: “I’m making a lot of movies and I have no plans … ever … to retire.” And then, talking to the Hollywood Reporter afterwards, he added that he has “an appetite for a western which I will someday hopefully do. It’s something that’s eluded me for all of these decades.”If you have been keeping track of Spielberg’s movements, this will not come as a surprise. Next year should see the release of an as yet untitled sci-fi film starring Emily Blunt and Josh O’Connor, which means The Fabelmans will not even be close to being his final work. And that is undoubtedly a good thing, since if a talent like Spielberg still has the passion and ability to keep making films, the world will be richer for it.And he isn’t alone in his desire never to stop working. Last month,Tom Cruise declared his intentionto still be making films when he’s 100. Again, this is great – maybe he and Spielberg will even team up and do a Minority Report sequel a decade from now – but it is slightly unusual for them to say it out loud.View image in fullscreenMaybe we’ll get a Minority Report 2? Tom Cruise and Spielberg at the Oscars in 2023.Photograph: Dana Pleasant/Newspix InternationalBecause the expectation is that film-makers won’t retire. Martin Scorsese is 82 and shows no signs of stopping. So is Werner Herzog, and his next improbably titled film, Bucking Fastard, is in post-production. Francis Ford Coppola istouring Megalopolisat the age of 86. And Ridley Scott, 87, has four films in various stages of production including a sci-fi, a western and a Bee Gees biopic. When David Lynch died this year, aged 78, he wasstill tryingto get his Netflix series Unrecorded Night off the ground. If you make films for a living, then everyone wants you to do it until you drop.This is for a couple of reasons. With age comes wisdom and confidence and perspective, which makes for richer storytelling. Scorsese claims that his film Silence took 30 years to make, for instance, because he was waiting to amass the right amount of experience to give it the proper respect. And The Fabelmans would have been wildly different if Spielberg had made it in his 50s, 40s or 30s.Furthermore, making a film is a battle. The time between concept and completion is measured in years. The process is such a slog that, when a film-maker dies, the likelihood is that several unrealised movies die with them. Wouldn’t you keep going to the bitter end if you were in their shoes?View image in fullscreenHow many more? … Quentin Tarantino.Photograph: Valéry Hache/AFP/Getty ImagesIn fact, the expectation to continue no matter what is so ingrained that people struggle with the thought of a film-maker retiring. In every interviewQuentin Tarantinohas given for the last decade, he has been asked about his decision to walk away after his next film. And Tarantino is 62. By the time what he says will be his final film comes out, he’ll be pushing 70. In any other industry, that would be prime retirement age. He’d release it, give his last interview, then spend the rest of his life watching daytime TV in his favourite slippers. Yet, because he makes films, people are baffled by the idea of him stopping.Such is the life of a director. Unless you are a Tarantino-style outlier, retirement isn’t an option. You are destined to keep going, until either you die or the entire film industry dies around you. And really, at this point, it’s a coin toss.Explore more on these topicsFilmSteven SpielbergMartin ScorseseFrancis Ford  CoppolaWerner HerzogQuentin TarantinocommentShareReuse this content"

For the interracial gay couple in Harrison David Rivers’s 2017 play, those voices are freighted with complexity: white privilege and Black hurt, queer joy and rage, all shimmering around the simplest dialogue.Jesse (Omari Douglas) is a Black playwright who prioritises his work; Neil (Alexander Lincoln) is a white activist who comes from wealth and will cross the country to support a protest. Set between 2012 and 2015 – from Obama in excelsis to rising Trump – the play skitters across this timeline, not always clearly (“Emotional truth is of greater value than logic,” reads an author’s note). Scenes are short and sharp – some only a splinter – and typically end in a snog or a strop.View image in fullscreenFinely cast … Alexander Lincoln and Omari Douglas in This Bitter Earth.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn Billy Porter’s finely cast production, Douglas’s Jesse, spindly and spiky, has a crackling chemistry with Lincoln’s righteous, goofy Neil. The pair relate their first encounter – when Neil demonstrated his allyship at a protest, clinging to a statue and reciting poetry (“This bitch with the bullhorn,” as Jesse calls him). Cue fierce conversations in cabs, bars and subways. Neil can’t understand his lover’s wariness around public dissent; Jesse despairs at the other’s unquestioned ease. Jesse, his hinterland withheld, finds it easier to address the audience than unpack his mind to Neil.Rivers drives a wild ride – he’ll grab the wheel and swerve between acrimony and snuggle, from banter to bitter division. As the couple navigate their differences, conversations get deep quickly – perhaps they were always skating on thin ice.‘What are you trying to incite?’ Billy Porter asks thorny questions with This Bitter EarthRead moreRivers’s writing can editorialise, and while Porter’s production brings energy and an excellent playlist, it pushes hard on the pedals – the actors commit to flirt and fight, but by the end of the 90 minutes, both voices sound raw. Lee Curran’s lighting frames the stage in neon, flaring yellow in alarm whenever something terrible happens in the wider country – as it does, again and again. And, as slowly emerges, something terrible also happens close at hand.AtSoho theatre, London, until 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreBilly PorterOmari DouglasPolitical theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

But here he portrays ordinary folk on a piece of common land near his birthplace, the Suffolk town Sudbury. Common land was a medieval tradition that provided wood, grazing and the equivalent of a modern park for the entire community. But commons were gradually “enclosed” from the Tudor age to Gainsborough’s time as villages became increasingly unequal and wealthy farmers and landowners developed more capitalistic farming practices. Gainsborough is making a radical, nostalgic last-ditch defence of a vanishing world in this painting. His common people enjoy the land under a superb canopy of auburn trees and silvery clouds – a beautiful glimpse of this land as it might be.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get in TouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The stars – Jim Sturgess and Rory Walton-Smith as older and younger Daniel, and Teresa Palmer and Florence Hunt as older and younger Alison – are wonderful across the board, and the soundtrack is stuffed with 80s bangers from New Order to the Cure.

The Boss has released seven lost albums, made between 1983 and 2018. Where to start? Let our Bruce scholars light you through the darkness …Laura BartonandMichael HannFri 27 Jun 2025 05.47 EDTLast modified on Fri 27 Jun 2025 07.26 EDTShareBruce Springsteen is opening his treasure trove: Tracks II: The Lost Albums features 83 previously unheard songs – unless of course you’re one of the close friends that Springsteen has apparently been playing them to “for years” – from unreleased albums made in the gaps between his storied catalogue, spanning 1983 to 2018. To make sense of this vast tranche of new material, we got “tramps” Michael Hann and Laura Barton to pull apart the risks, regrets and riches in this landmark box set.Michael HannI saw the trailer forSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowherethe other day, which shows the symbolic moment in which the young Bruce buys his first new car, a 305 V8. “It’s awfully fitting for a handsome devil rock star,” the salesman says, leaning through the window. “I do know who you are.” Springsteen looks up and says, wistfully. “Well, that makes one of us.” I think that captures whatTracks II: The Lost Albumsare,with Springsteen making sense of himself in those years when the world had decided on a very clear idea of which Bruce Springsteen it wanted, thank you very much. My feeling is that now, he’s very clearly delineated the Boss from another, more nuanced version of Bruce Springsteen. The Boss tours with the E Street Band; Bruce Springsteen writes a memoir, performs a Broadway one-man show, makes left-field records following his muse. Now he’s maybe able to do what he wanted to do in the late 80s and through the 90s because he’s secure in being able to switch between those two ideas – and he does know “the Boss” is an idea that he created – and also secure that his audience trusts him enough not always to be the Boss.View image in fullscreenSeven stars … the artwork for Tracks II: The Lost AlbumsLaura BartonI think you’re spot on about this, and particularly about what The Lost Albums are. But it’s interesting that even in the early 80s, shortly before these recordings began, he stepped away from being the Boss – releasing Nebraska rather than Born in the USA. I’m never quite sure whether that was through confidence or compulsion or a kind of necessity. Whatever it was, I think it established a tension between these two Bruces that has proved fruitful. I should probably add that maybe that tension began with songs like Stolen Car and The River in 1980, but that’s for another conversation, and probably he addresses it himself in 1987 on Tunnel of Love’s Two Faces …MHWhere do you hear the closest to your platonic ideal of Bruce within this set?LBIn the first two tracks from the Streets of Philadelphia Sessions, made around 1993 – Blind Spot and Maybe I Don’t Know You. They have all that encroaching darkness that marks my favourite Bruce songs. You?MHI thought it would be on LA Garage Sessions ’83. They really did just sound like band demos. What surprised me and tickled me the most was Twilight Hours, the Bacharach-style album, where there were plenty of other musicians. He wrote this in tandem with2019’s Western Stars, and while I wasn’t mad about Western Stars, I thought the Twilight Hours songs found something very reflective of age in them, and also take Bruce back to an American bar tradition, albeit a different kind of bar to The Stone Pony.LBI laughed out loud when Twilight Hours opened, in a warm and surprised way. I love that tradition of American songwriting – and performance. It’s Bacharach, but there’s a lot of the longing of Jimmy Webb or Glen Campbell to the material. But his voice here is fascinating to me, because I’m guessing for a lot of singers there comes a point where they wonder which way to go, and an awful lot of well-known artists pursue the classics and mine the American songbook and take on that sort of fireside persona, and it’s interesting that Bruce could have taken that path.View image in fullscreenLong ride ahead … Springsteen in the saddle.Photograph: Danny ClinchMHThat’s interesting, because I don’t hear these songs that way. Darkness on the Edge of Town, from 1978, ismy favourite Springsteen album, and this seems – in a very peculiar way – a companion to that. It sounds like the record the parents of the characters in Darkness might have been listening to, addressing their concerns.LBThat’s a good way to put it, but I’m not saying it sounds like a fireside album. I’m saying that the croon of his voice opens that avenue, and it’s not one I ever considered for Bruce.MHYou’re right about the croon. I think his voice sounds better on Twilight Hours than it does on rock songs now. It’s nice not hearing the effort. But I want to bring you back to the Streets of Philadelphia Sessions. I love the songs there, but hate the arrangements. Well not even the arrangements. The drum loops,inspired in part by the era’s west coast hip-hop. It dates it all so badly. I keep expecting manager Jon Landau to shout: “Hear the drummer get wicked!” We both have bits of the Bruce catalogue we don’t much like thesoundof. But this?LBI love those loops and will defend them to the death.MHYou OK, hun? You’ve hardly touched your Little Steven bandana print toilet paper.LBWhen I heard they would be included I feared they would sound dated, but unexpectedly I just don’t think they do. There’s something very stark and sombre about the way they’re used. I’m listening to Streets of Philadelphia’s Blind Spot and there’s a yelp in there that is very different to the howl of say, I’m on Fire or Atlantic City, but there’s something animalistic about it that hits a similar spot for me. Some of my favourite Bruce moments across his career are those beyond-words utterances.MHI quite like the fact this is, in the main, a bunch of genre exercises. I usually think his genre pastiches are the weakest thing in his repertoire – top o’ the mornin’ to you Irish-American folk-punk – but putting these collections out in this way enables me to hear them not as “the album after Tom Joad” or whatever, but as discrete little packages.LBOh that’s interesting, because I now don’t see them as discrete little packages so much as ongoing conversations with his own music.MHI know that’s what they are for him. Because he’s been having that conversation with these songs over years, whereas for me they’re brand new information. It’s like hearing an old friend say: “Did I ever tell you about the time I got married and divorced in a weekend in Ulaanbaatar?”LBDo you think that will change with repeated listening? Because the way I’ve been listening to them over the past few weeks has been mixed in with the rest of his repertoire.

I’m fascinated by the way a generation of older musicians – Bruce, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell – have been emptying their vaults. I can’t imagine it’s solely about raking in those sweet geriatric bucks. I wonder if they all, in their ways, want to forestall all the questioning about, well, everything. It’s as if they’re saying: Here it all is, everything that has passed through my musical mind; you decide for yourself.LBMy suspicion is that it’s something to do with the freedom and sure-footedness you can find the older you get. That it’s something about not being afraid to be seen. So in the same way thatBruce wrote the autobiographyandthe Broadway show, and some of that exposed elements of his life and career that a younger Bruce might have wanted to keep hidden – to me this feels like an extension of that. And maybe there’s a connection to the opening of the new Springsteen Archives/Center for American Musicnext year: a gift to our understanding of a body of work. It’s acknowledging that there’s illumination in showing your working.MHThere’s something he’s said in interviews that interests me, when he has said his audience “wasn’t ready” for these albums. Which suggests a certain insecurity he has since overcome. Because, in truth, only the obsessional are going to be delving deep into this much music, and that’s fine, and that would have been true then, as well. But at that time, without the E Street Band, he maybe felt he risked too much. So if he wasn’t going to make rock music for the best part of a decade, he had best not throw out too much non-rock, so that the rockers were still there when he was ready to come back. I don’t think there’s any such insecurity now he plays to 75,000 people a night again in Europe.LBYes, possibly. Or maybe it wasn’t insecurity, it was just Bruce’s understanding of how much an audience can take. I’m always really interested in how he knows just how long to take any solo or musical diversion or “jam” in a live show. It never feels indulgent to me. In a similar way, I think he has a profound understanding of what an audience can take in a broader sense, perhaps before they do. Also, side note, I think a lot of the audience not being “ready” relates to my beloved Streets of Philadelphia Sessions, and Bruce thinking audiences weren’t able to take a fourth album about curdled relationships after Tunnel of Love, Human Touch and Lucky Town.MHCan we talk about the missing thing? Electric Nebraska. In a Rolling Stone piece, Springsteen first said no such thing existed. Then a week later he texted the writer to say: Oh, I had a poke and there is an Electric Nebraska, “though it does not have the full album of songs”. Which strikes me as both coy and disingenuous. But that seems so much part of this story, and I can only guess that’s being held back for a Nebraska reissue to go with the film. Is it churlish to be unhappy about something missing from several hours of unheard music?LBYes it is churlish! I’m teasing you. Let’s discuss it!Bruce Springsteen: Sunday Love – videoMHYou talked about this music being part of the ongoing conversation. In this case, it feels a little like your friend telling you: “That thing you really want to know? I’ll probably tell you. Yeah, but not now.”LBTo which I would say: “That’s fine, it’s yours to tell or not tell.”MHWhich album do you think is weakest? For me, it’s Faithless, recorded between 2005 and 2006 as a soundtrack to a movie that never got made. I think it’s the weakest not because of any explicit shortcomings on its part, but more because its sonic character isn’t as fully defined as the others: it sounds as though any one of those songs could have been on the other records, but few of those songs could have been on Faithless.LBI actually like Faithless. Though at times it was one of the points in this collection that made me want to hear Bruce work with other, more unexpected collaborators. I’d love to hear a soundtrack that set Bruce’s voice against, say, an Oliver Coates cello piece. I took a little longer to find my footing in Inyo. Which surprised me, because Inyo really came out of The Ghost of Tom Joad, which I love.MHI love the splashes of colour on Inyo from the mariachi band. It’s not quite the mariachi album that was billed, but there’s a joy in those songs – amid the hard times of a lot of the lyrics – that, again, reminds me of the thing the E Street Band do of finding joy in the despair.View image in fullscreenA life’s work … Springsteen as a young boyLBYes, I think it took a while for me to see those splashes of colour, because for a while it all felt quite bleached-out. What did you think of Perfect World? Less an album, more a compilation of tracks from the mid-90 to early 2010s.MHIt’s a ragbag, but I think he was right that the collection needed some rock, and while there’s no Badlands on it, there are some songs I’d be very happy to hear in the live set. I guess what’s amazing is that at this point it is possible for Springsteen to release all this unheard music and for it to contain music that’s not just interesting, not just decent, but contains a worthwhile number of songs that genuinely bear comparison to anything from any point in his career. The Klansman, Shut Out the Light, High Sierra – those all seem like masterpieces to me. And, as with Tracks, there are some smaller numbers that are fantastic – Janey, Don’t Lose Your Heart on both Tracks collections, and on this one The Great Depression is, I suspect, going to be my go-to semi-throwaway.Bruce Springsteen review – a roaring, rousing ​s​how that imagines a better AmericaRead moreLBI was going to ask you if there is a song on this collection you think might grow to be one of your favourites? I know when I got Dylan’s Biograph the version of I’ll Keep It With Mine on there eventually became my favourite Dylan song of all time. I’m not sure whether I’ve yet found that overwhelming feeling about a song here yet, but I agree with you about The Klansman and High Sierra. And I could see my relationship with Maybe I Don’t Know You becoming quite intense.MHAnd there’s Tracks III to come, touted as five more albums-worth of music stretching from his debut in 1973 to last year. Plus – I bet – Electric Nebraska. It feels like so much. I just hope we get to hear some of this music some time.

When the Guardian interviewed festival-goers queueing as the gates opened on Wednesday, several listed him as the artist they were most looking forward to seeing this year. The crowd he draws is vast: both a reminder of how successful his first two albums were – his debut was the bestselling UK album of 2019and2020 – and of the emotional charge that his appearance carries. He last played Glastonbury in 2023: it was supposed to be a return to live performances after he had to cancel a series of gigs amid struggles with his mental health and Tourette syndrome. Instead, his voice gave out, and Capaldi subsequently retreated from public view.He says he’s “easing into this” but, it has to be said, he looks noticeably less anxious two years on. There are no signs of the physical tics that beset him during the promotion of his second album, Broken By Desire to Be Heavenly Sent, and his voice is as roaring as it ever was. There’s definitely less of what Capaldi used to call “the blather” – the reliably hilarious and foul-mouthed between-song chat that frequently used to last longer than the actual songs – partly because of time constraints, and partly, he says, because he’s worried that he’s going to cry. When he does try to talk he’s frequently drowned out by the sound of the crowd singing his name to the tune of the White Stripes’ Seven Nation Army.View image in fullscreenDrowned out by the crowd … Capaldi at the Pyramid stage.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAFrom the opening notes of Before You Go, the crowd sing along to every song he plays, only ceasing when he performs a new song, Survive, that’s very clearly inspired by the events of the last two years: “I’m going to get up again, I’m going to get up and try if it’s the last thing I do.” It’s slow-paced, soaring-chorused business as usual, but whatever other advances have taken place in pop since Capaldi absented himself, the success of Alex Warren, Benson Boone et al. proves there’s still a substantial space for earnest, melancholy young men with acoustic guitars.He ends, inevitably, with Someone You Loved, which provokes a crowd sing-along that makes all the previous sing-alongs seem like rehearsals: as he predicted, Capaldi’s eyes start to brim. “Second time’s the charm, eh?” he nods: it would require a very hard heart indeed not to be moved yourself.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Lewis CapaldiFestivalsGlastonbury festivalMusic festivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s an intriguing beginning to the kind of Glastonbury set that captures an artist at what seems to be a tipping point of their career, that carries with it the distinct sense that they may be on the verge of becoming absolutely huge. The crowd she draws is vast and they respond to the handful of tracks already released from her forthcoming third album Euro-Country as if they’re her greatest hits. The celebrity-endorsed TikTok dance craze spawned by recent single Take a Sexy Picture of Me has clearly had some role to play in boosting her popularity – its arrival mid-set prompts a spontaneous crowd sing along; someone in the audience is so excited they let a smoke flare off midway through; the big screens reveal that even a security guard standing by the loos at the side of the stage is pumping his fist – but it can’t account for the rapturous reaction afforded her entire set.View image in fullscreenNext year’s headliner? … CMAT and her band.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAWhat does is that CMAT is a fantastic pop star. It’s not merely that she’ssmart, funny, gobbily outspoken, and looks fantastic – today she’s clad in huge earrings in the shape of the euro symboland blue plastic dress that she removes to reveal a matching blue leotard, while mocking the fat-shaming comments posted about her on social media. It’s not just that she is blessed with both a potent, octave-leaping voice and a surfeit of superb, hook-laden songs that split the difference between country mid-70s Fleetwood Mac and come equipped with sharp, witty lyrics. It’s that she’s a quite spectacularly brilliant live performer. She alternates between stage moves that very much hail from the Dance Like No One’s Watching school of abandon, and choreographed routines with her band members: at the climax of one, she rips off her male band members’ skirts in a manner reminiscent of Bucks Fizz’s famous Eurovision moment. She announces herself as possessed of “middle child syndrome, an amazing arse and the best Irish country rock’n’roll band in the world” and beckons for applause whenever she mentions her own name – when the crowd start chanting her name of their own accord, she responds by bending over and wiggling her bum at them. When she successfully encourages the audience to engage in synchronised dance moves to I Wanna Be a Cowboy, Baby!, she looks quite startled at what a crowd this size enthusiastically dancing in unison looks like.It’s all incredibly engaging and preposterously good fun, and it reaches a climax with Stay for Something She runs to the barrier at the front stage, climbs on top of it, hugs a fan, strikes a series of coquettish poses, then – to the visible horror of the security guard accompanying her – motions for the crowd to part, runs into their centre and delivers the final chorus in the middle of the audience. Back on stage, she leads a chant of “free Palestine” and she’s gone – it really doesn’t seem inconceivable that she could be headlining the next time she returns.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury festivalGlastonbury 2025FestivalsMusic festivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Though listed on the schedule only as the mysterious “TBA”, playing the Woodsie stage for an hour shortly after the festival’s kick-off on Friday morning, the anonymous artist’s identity was seemingly widely known weeks before.Ella Yelich-O’Connor herself had not been exactly subtle, meaningfully flashing her eyes at Radio 1’s Greg James when he pointed out that the release of her fourth album, Virgin, coincided with Glastonbury’s first day. On Thursday, ahead of Virgin’s release, she provided confirmation by posting an aerial photo of the Woodsies tent on Instagram.Lorde: Virgin review | Alexis Petridis’s album of the weekRead moreIt’s a bold move, to debut a new album to a crowd who won’t yet have had a chance to listen to it, let alone form any impressions – but Lorde has that kind of clout. Since her precocious debut, Pure Heroine, she has enjoyed a devout fanbase, many of whom look on her as a big sister figure: worldly and warm, but only intermittently available. With 2017’s critically acclaimedMelodrama, too, she secured her status as a pop star who is only more attention-grabbing for having only sporadic releases.With Virgin – it’s been made clear, from the three singles and pre-album press – Yelich O’Connor is taking a different tack to music, attempting something looser, more immediate and more off-the-cuff. She debuted first single What Was That with a guerilla performance in New York City’s Washington Square Park, and has since played a series of small pop-up gigs to only the most connected fans. Second single Man of the Year and opening track Hammer both have a suggestive, half-finished yet considered quality, as though Lorde was gently attempting to warn fans: she is not the same star that they remember.Arriving on stage to strobe lighting and a huge cheer, Lorde is dressed simply in a white baby tee and cargo pants, resembling, with her shock of dark hair, Patti Smith – and also her younger self. ForSolar Power– her uncharacteristically sunny third album, which received faltering reviews – Lorde experimented with bleach-blond hair and variously sexy and/or smooth brain’d personae. Today, accompanied by a low-profile band, she appears minimalistic, uncomplicated, direct: recognisable as the teenager who burst out of nowhere with a sharp-eyed satire of celebrity excess, known for her big hair and idiosyncratic dance moves. And the crowd is glad to be reunited.But when it becomes clear Lorde is playing the new album in full, with a seamless transition from What Was That into a new song, Shape Shifter, the crowd’s energy visibly begins to flag. Yelich-O’Connor has always been a fully fledged performer; here, she kneels on the stage, hoiks up her T-shirt to caress her stomach, and plays to the camera with her face, smizing and snarling to impress upon us the personal nature of the lyrics. Like many songs on the album, Shape Shifter deals with Lorde’s desire not to be pinned on to any one evolution or identity, and reflects on those she’s lived so far: the siren, the saint. “I’ve been up on the pedestal, but tonight I just wanna fall.”View image in fullscreenThankful … Lorde on the Woodsies stage.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Hogan Media/ShutterstockBut though the audience extends her goodwill, bobbing gently to the music, it is just difficult to grasp the shape of these unfamiliar songs, lacking as they do immediate or obvious hooks and dealing with intimate and often challenging subject matter. She declines to give context, only addressing the crowd until after Favourite Daughter, a deceptively upbeat song about burnout, fuelled by familial (and fatherly) expectations. She thanks us for “being here with us on the day that Virgin is born”, and adds that this full album play-through may be a one-off. The crowd is clearly cheered by the sense of exclusivity, and to witness the return of their favourite pop star, but the songs aren’t immediately arresting enough to make the moment.Clearblue stands out among the new tracks, bringing to mind both Yellow Flicker Beat, Lorde’s excellent inclusion on The Hunger Games soundtack, and Imogen Heap’s iconic Hide and Seek in its pared-back layering of electronic vocals. But it’s a song for listening on headphones at home; the audience in the tent seems a little nonplussed. Later, the heartbreaking lyrics of Broken Glass – explicitly dealing with an eating disorder and the long reckoning of recovery – is lost on an audience who have not been given the chance to sit with them.“I didn’t know if I’d make another record, to be honest – but I’m back here, completely free,” Lorde says, to huge cheers. “I’m so grateful to you for waiting.” The packed-out tent is proof of how many people are willing to follow her wherever she will go, to bear with her while she figures out how she wants to present herself to the world. When, after David, the final track of Virgin, the opening chords of her much-loved song Ribs ring out, it feels like Lorde is rewarding fans for their patience – quite literally throwing them a bone.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025LordePop and rockGlastonbury festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

But it didn’t stop it being so amazing to see her. She was brilliant, the new songs were great.”Setting the tone for the day, it was the sort of magical start that has become synonymous with the Glastonbury experience: unexpected, emotional, energetic, enigmatic.View image in fullscreenLorde during her not-so-secret set.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Hogan Media/ShutterstockThrough sunny intervals and 25C temperatures, festivalgoers meandered through the fields of Pilton dressed in outfits ranging from practical Patagonia to tutus and superhero and pirate costumes.Early arrivers on Wednesday were treated to a circus performance on the Pyramid stage – a quiet affair, given that Glastonbury’s licence does not allow for loud music until Thursday – in which spectators hummed and sang along to large samba drums.Supergrass opened the festivities on the Pyramid stage, the indie rockers’ 1995 hit Alright – with its tribute to the rebellious spirit of youth – a fitting anthem for the occasion.Charli xcx and Neil Young to Juan Atkins and the Asian underground: what to see at GlastonburyRead moreMusic fans were looking ahead to another 90s veteran, Alanis Morissette, making her Glastonbury debut in the 30th anniversary year of the release of her record-breaking album Jagged Little Pill, and another rumoured “secret” set from Lewis Capaldi, who has only recently returned to performing after taking a two-year hiatus to focus on his mental health.Chase Bartlett, 28, from Bristol, started his day queueing for an hour with friends for warm showers near the Acoustic stage. “Everyone’s very happy, having a good time,” he said. Queueing with him, Danielle Vincent, 29, from Bristol, added: “It’s like a different planet. You can’t describe what it’s like here to somebody that’s not been.”“You see all sorts,” Bartlett said. “I saw a man on the phone to a potato and then he gave it to another man who started playing it: it was a harmonica.”Bartlett saw that Robbie Williams had posted an image on Instagram from the festival and was convinced the former Take That member was playing one of the many secret gigs. “And we’re going to see Loyle Carner tonight and can’t wait,” he added.Carner headlines the Other stage on Friday after an appearance from the hip-hop legend Busta Rhymes.The customary flag-waving crowd were in full force, with Palestinian flags particularly prominent in a year of increasing geopolitical unrest, although nauseating puns were abundant too, along with apparent in-jokes and surreal tributes to dead pets.View image in fullscreenFlag-wavers were in full force.Photograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APKneecap’s appearance on Saturday was being hotly discussed among the crowd, interest piqued by the controversy the Irish-language rappers have courted in recent months. One of the group, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, has been charged under terrorism laws and is on bail. Senior politicans, including Keir Starmer, have said the band’s inclusion on the bill was inappropriate.Sarah Hall, 34, from Ipswich, said she had been to Glastonbury three times and always thought of it as a political festival. “The festival supports great causes and charities, and I would expect nothing else from it this year. Things feel a bit heavy out there so I would expect Glastonbury to sort of deal with that.”Michael Eavis: people who disagree with Glastonbury’s politics can go elsewhereRead moreBut alongside the serious issues of politics, war, climate emergency and equality, there are countless moments of escapism and joy. From the circus performers to the hippies in the healing fields, Glastonbury is a place where people come together to celebrate life.The Greenpeace stage hosted a Letters Live event, in which a variety of letters spanning centuries were read by some surprise celebrities, including Benedict Cumberbatch, Bella Ramsay, Andrew Scott, Paapa Essiedu, James Norton and Simon Pegg.Highlights included a deeply poignant letter from a soldier in 1944 to his lover, a fellow soldier who had died the previous year, read by Scott, and a funny proposal letter written in 1866 by a Middlesbrough farmer to a woman he wanted to marry, in which he said he “had my eye on you for a long time”.To big laughs from the crowd, Norton, in his rarely used Yorkshire accent, read: “I shall marry you on May Day or if my mother dies afore, I will marry you afore.”And Glastonbury is no stranger to weddings. Charles and Charlie Shires, 32 and 31 respectively, from Harrogate, were married in the Healing Fields at 10am on Thursday.View image in fullscreen‘We can relax now it’s done’: Charlie and Charles Shires.Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian“It was a spiritual ceremony,” said Charlie, wearing a white dress with mud-flecked hem and black boots that she has worn to the festival before. The couple had about 15 friends including bridesmaids attend the wedding, officiated by a celebrant, Glenda.“We love Glastonbury so we wanted to do something here,” said Charlie, who has been to the festival four times.Charles, who is at Glastonbury for the sixth time, said: “We wanted to get married in a unique place.”Charlie works for HG1 Cake Couture, and brought her own wedding cake 250 miles from Harrogate to Worthy Farm – a chocolate and pistachio treat, which the couple sliced up and handed out to a crowd who were watching a live broadcast of the BBC podcast Sidetracked with Annie Mac and Nick Grimshaw.“We can relax now it’s done,” Charles said, looking ahead to a honeymoon featuring Charlie xcx.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025LordeGlastonbury festivalMusic festivalsFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.If convicted on all counts, hecould face up to life in prison.Closing arguments begin in Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sex-trafficking trialRead moreThroughout the trial and again in closing arguments, Combs’s legal teamacknowledged past incidents of domestic violence, but maintained thatall sexual encounters were consensualand part of what they described as a “swingers lifestyle”. The defense has denied that Combs committed sex trafficking and have said that nocriminal conspiracy existed.“We own the domestic violence, I hope you guys know that,” Agnifilo told the jury on Friday. “It happened. That’s not charged. He did not do the things he is charged with.”Framing Combs as a successful businessman, Agnifilo described his client as a “self-made, successful, Black entrepreneur” who built “wonderful, sophisticated, real businesses that have stood the test of time”.Throughout the trial, the defense has sought to portray two women at the heart of the case–singer Casandra “Cassie” Venturaand a woman testifying under the pseudonym“Jane”–as willing and consenting participants in the sex parties, which were often referred to as “freak-offs”.Both Ventura and Jane testified during the trial that they werecoercedby Combs to participate in the drug-fueled “freak-offs” that they said Combs directed, watched, masturbated to and sometimes filmed.They also described instances of physical abuse, and alleged that Combs wouldthreatento releaseexplicit videosof them or cut off financial support if they defied him.In his closing, Agnifilo challenged witness accounts, pushed back on the government’s allegations, and disputed the prosecution’s portrayal of Ventura and Jane as sex-trafficking victims.Agnifilocast Ventura, the government’s star witness, as a woman with agency, rather than a victim.He pointed to the $20m settlement she received from Combs in 2023 after filing a civil lawsuit accusing him of abuse, which triggered the federal investigation. He also pointed to the $10m Ventura is expected to receive from the owner of a hotel in Los Angeles where she was assaulted by Combs in 2016.“If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it’s hard not to pick Cassie,” Agnifilo said. “This isn’t about a crime, this is about money.”At one point during closing, Agnifilo seemed to mock the government’s2024 raidson Combs’s homes, during which investigators reportedly seized more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant.“Boxes of Astroglide, taken off the streets, whoo! I feel better already,” Agnifilo said sarcastically. “Way to go, fellas.”Agnifilo also criticized the racketeering charge, saying no one else was charged alongside Combs and that no witness testified to being part of a criminal enterprise.He closed his argument by urging the jury to acquit Combs.“He is not a racketeer. He is none of these things. He is innocent,” Agnifilo said. “Return him to his family who have been waiting for him.”Combs’s six adult children were present in court on Friday, as was his mother.Agnifilo’s closing argument lasted about four hours.The government then gave a one-hour rebuttal, which is the final step before the case goes to the 12-member jury to decide Combs’s fate.In their rebuttal, prosecutors claimed that the defense spent a “whole lot of energy” during the closing argument trying to blame Combs’s “victims and the US government” for Combs’s “lies, his threats and for his inexcusable behavior”.The judge said on Friday that the jury will begin deliberations on Monday.Outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan on Friday, some demonstrators gathered in support of sexual assault survivors.The protest was organized by gender justice group UltraViolet.In a statement, Elisa Batista, the campaign director at UltraViolet said: “We are here for the brave men and women who testified in the Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs trial, sharing harrowing stories of systemic and violent abuse, as well as those who weren’t able to.”“No matter the verdict in this trial, survivors still have power,” she said. “And when we stand together, accountability is achievable.”Prosecution and defense rest case in Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sex-trafficking trialRead moreOn Thursday, the government presented its own closing argument, with Christy Slavikspending nearly five hoursoutlining the government’s case against the music mogul.The US attorney described Combs as “the leader of a criminal enterprise” who refused to “take no for an answer” and as someone who wielded “power, violence and fear to get what he wanted”.“The defendant was a very powerful man,” she said. “But he became more powerful and more dangerous because of the support of his inner circle and his businesses – the enterprise.”Slavik walked the jury through the weeks of testimony and evidence the government presented over the course of seven weeks.“Up until today, the defendant was able to get away with these crimes because of his money, his power, his influence,” she said. “That stops now. It’s time to hold him accountable. It’s time for justice. It’s time to find the defendant guilty.”Jurors also heard for the first time on Thursday about allegations that Combs engaged in witness tampering and obstruction – part of the broader racketeering charge – with regards to “Jane” and another woman, who testified under the pseudonym “Mia”.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsNew YorkSex traffickingUS crimeHip-hopRapnewsShareReuse this content"

His family subsequently attempted to destroy all evidence of the man who had shamed their proud line of landowners and empire builders.Seiriol Davies first discovered hints of the forgotten, cross-dressing Edwardian aristocrat on childhood trips to a local National Trust property, and debuted this chamber musical about him on the Edinburgh fringenine years ago. This new production, directed by Lisa Spirling, adds zhuzh to the songs, with an onstage four-piece band – directed by Dylan Townley’s Maestro – augmenting its original cast.As Paget, Davies sparkles in a series of fabulous outfits beneath designer Hayley Grindle’s studded-collar proscenium arch (there are also shades of Faringdon House, the home of Paget’s fellow aesthete Lord Berners, who makes an appearance in the story). Both script and songs are crammed with wit as we pinball between classical harmonies, dance breaks and interactive gags with prompt cards.View image in fullscreenFresh zhuzh … How to Win Against History.Photograph: Pamela RaithA colonial-nod of a patter song, extolling “boots and feathers”, races us through Paget’s typically brutal boarding school upbringing and propels us towards his marriage of convenience with his cousin Lilian. She is played – along with all the other people in Paget’s life – by the indefatigable Matthew Blake, exhibiting great comic range as the ultimate “supporting actor” here.We see him most as Mr Alexander Keith, a Victorian impresario in an enormous peach smoking jacket and the closest thing Paget has to a friend as they tour their terrible shows together. Supposedly Paget’s bad art is his way of trying to find human connection. The problem is that, beyond the wide-eyed delusions and the metaphors about diamonds living in his head, we never get enough of a sense of him to know what that means.His loneliness may be touchingly real but the sentimental moments arrive like a demand for sympathy rather than something earned. Providing restitution from historical erasure is undoubtedly a worthy goal of art – but this show feels more like a message than an encounter.AtBristol Old Vicuntil 12 July.

In 1905 New York, Esther, a skilled Black corset-maker, creates ravishing undergarments in Wedgwood blue or salmon pink, trimmed with “every manner of accoutrement”. Stitching romance for others, she fears she will never know her own – until George begins writing from Panama, where he is labouring on the canal.Tucked into her modest, mouse-grey dress, Samira Wiley’s Esther embroiders dreams with every letter. Despite forebodings from her landlady (Nicola Hughes, plush and beady), she insists: “I am his sweetheart twice a month and I can fill that envelope with anything I want.” Kadiff Kirwan’s melodious, greedy-eyed George arrives in New York and the first act ends on the edge of hope. Later, disappointment settles: intimacies fray, promises prove moth-eaten.View image in fullscreenTumbling out confidences … Faith Omole in Intimate Apparel.Photograph: Helen MurrayFoot on the treadle, eye on the lace, Esther knows her worth. Nottage writes so well about work: the painstaking immersion of time, thought and effort. The audience, fully invested in Esther’s world, gasped when George tossed aside her tailoring: how callous to spurn a love-stitched jacket. Wiley’s fragile frame can barely hold the hurt.Esther’s clients are unmarried, or yoked without love. Intimacy seems possible in your scanties: Faith Omole’s sex worker and Claudia Jolly’s wealthy wife tumble out confidences as she tweaks their corsets. Esther also visits a Jewish fabric salesman (Alex Waldmann, beautifully tentative), tenderly scanning swathes of kingfisher silk or wool spun from cosseted Scottish sheep. Restrictive garments play against unbounded imaginings.Lynn Nottage: Intimate Apparel and what lies beneath my playsRead moreNottage’s writing in the two-handed scenes is palpably lush (“a gentle touch is gold in any country”), but each line sharpens a character or sighs the tale forward. Working with movement directorShelley Maxwell, Lynette Linton’s production becomes a dance, a poem: bodies swoop around one another, voices tangle in song, teasing out the sensuality these New Yorkers crave but must deny themselves.The acting is incredibly fine: Linton’s great gift is to see people from every angle. Nottage’s play began when she found a photo of her seamstress great-grandmother and wanted to imagine her story. This tremendous production and Wiley’s superb performance fill out a life unknown.AtDonmar Warehouse, London, until 9 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreDonmar WarehouseLynn NottageLynette LintonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Every side is pasted with neurotic headlines misinforming passersby about vaccines. It is an odd, not to mention dangerous,throwback to the pandemic.So, too, in its own benign way, is Douglas Maxwell’s play. It is not just that Man’s Best Friend concerns a lockdown-era bereavement, a hospital stay in isolation and a funeral on Zoom. It is also that its themes are steeped in those strange months when it felt we had been plucked out of time. Maxwell evokes the days when past and future were denied us.There is clapping for the NHS, a new moment of neighbourliness and an urge to yell out the names of those we have lost. More than that, there is a sense of rootlessness and irresolution. A world in limbo.It is apparent from the start that something is awry with Ronnie. Performed with storytelling panache by Jordan Young, he is a man who cannot settle. Despite a cheery disposition, an invigorating job as a dog walker and a satirical eye for the rituals of outdoor life, he is out of sorts. He is not yet an emergency case (he has based his Zen meditation techniques on an advert for Center Parcs), but nor is he at ease.Thus, he walks with Albert, Fury, Carlos, Coriander and Rex around the embracing curves of Becky Minto’s plank-lined set, as Grant Anderson’s lighting shifts from pale dawn to fiery dusk, Ross Collins’s cute canine illustrations come and go, and Maxwell’s monologue grows from lighthearted to maudlin. Beyond the easy comedy, it is a play stalked by death and a yearning for release.First seen in 2022 in the lunchtime seriesA Play, a Pie and a Pintand now restaged by Jemima Levick in a handsome 80-minute production, it is vivid and touching. But it is also not quite of this time. For all Maxwell’s perceptivity about loneliness, loss and dogs, and for all Young’s vulnerability and charm, the world of Man’s Best Friend is neither close enough nor far away enough to hit where it hurts.AtTron theatre, Glasgow, until 12 July; then touring, 3–27 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreTron theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

But the elements provided a sublimely atmospheric accompaniment to the drama.View image in fullscreenSublimely atmospheric … Teatr Biuro Podróży’s The Tempest.Photograph: Aleksandra BębenekThunder within the soundtrack became indistinguishable from the real thing. As lightning cracked across the shipwrecked boat carrying Antonio, who fetches up on this enchanted isle, it seemed like part of the lighting design. The company,which has long staged outdoor works across the world, spun its own magic, the actors sodden but heroically undeterred.Directed and co-written (with Marta Strzałko) by company founder Paweł Szkotak, this production is inspired by Shakespeare’s text rather than being a straight-up enactment. After the opening storm, the set is cracked apart and swivelled around to form promontories on the island, as well as the grounded remains of the boat. Stumps of trees scattered in the foreground are visual symbols of eco damage.Łukasz Matuszyk’s magnificent score reflects an island full ofaural enchantments – “sound and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not” – switching the tone between storybook delight and electronic rumbles, dread groans and pumping house beats.View image in fullscreenTradition and reinvention … Teatr Biuro Podróży’s Tempest.Photograph: Aleksandra BębenekThe Tempest is part of the outdoor offering at Malta festival, a multidisciplinary programme in its 35th year, and the show is travelling to the UK as part of an international tour. The festival this year is celebrating tradition and reinvention. This company give a microcosmic homage to this paradoxical mission in its early faithfulness and late disruption of Shakespeare’s text. It is mostly told through mime, music, physical theatre and inventive visual spectacle.Prospera is a female magician, Caliban her indentured slave in a suit with sinister bandages around his face. He is forced by Prospera to extract natural resources from the isle, hacking away at tree stumps with his tools (the eco message of the show has been carried through in production values, with much of the set crafted from reclaimed materials, including salvaged doors from Poznań tenement houses). Ariel is an imposing fairy on stilts. All hover between the delightful and dreadful.The seven-strong cast (Bartosz Borowski, Łukasz Kowalski, Paweł Stachowczyk, Marta Strzałko, Karolina Wensierska, Tomasz Wrzalik, Maciej Zakrzewski) bring stunning physicality to their parts. The drunken scenes involving Trinculo, Stephano and Caliban play out with surprising freshness and wit, involving beer and a wheelbarrow. The romance between Miranda and Ferdinand is water-bound in its motifs – the latteremerges out of the storm in bikini bottoms like a parody of a James Bond love interest – and there is lovely use of a pair of flippers. Endearing chemistry is created through the dances they do around and with each other.The show stays faithful until the closing scenes, when there is a coup orchestrated that is far bigger than Caliban’s planned rebellion. The sound of a helicopter is heard as a giant plume of smoke envelops the audience, from which emerge military figures bearing machine guns. It is as if we, the audience, enter into the dream world as the smoke drifts over us and the tone switches once again. There is no tidy redemption for the sorcerer-coloniser. Her magical creatures flee or are caught and caged, like zoo animals.Some loose ends are left dangling: Ariel seems simply to disappear; the young couple at the heart of the play, cocooned in their romantic bubble, seem impervious to the assault on Prospera’s isle. Maybe the message here is that only love will survive. The rain has cleared by the end of the night and despite the razed ground of this new ending, you are left with a delightful sense of invention, play – and, yes, magic.Malta festivalruns until 28 June. The Tempest is presented byWatermans, at Bell Square, London, 19-20 September as part of theUK/Poland Season 2025. Arifa Akbar’s trip was provided by the Polish Cultural Institute and the Adam Mickiewicz Institute, partners in the UK/Poland Season 2025 organised by the British Council.Explore more on these topicsTheatreThe TempestPolandWilliam ShakespearereviewsShareReuse this content"

The scenery is awesome: pointed white, limestone peaks above deep and mysterious pine-forested valleys. The books of mountaineer Julius Kugy romantically describe this large wilderness, the obscurity of which amazes me. Nature is abundant with various large mammals, bird life and flora. If you love alpine adventure but don’t like tourists then seek it out, there’s nobody there!PaulAlone with orchids and sea birds, SwedenView image in fullscreenSunset on Stora Karlsö, one of the world’s oldest nature reserves.Photograph: Johner Images/AlamyStora Karlsö, off the west coast of Gotland, is one of the oldest nature reserves in the world and is a few hours’ journey by train and ferry from Stockholm. It’s a tiny, rugged limestone island, mostly just a high cliff with an alvar (grassy heath) plateau. There were lots of orchids and plenty of sea birds. Once sheltered from the wind, I found the fragrant air was incredible. I spent the night in a simple cabin and enjoyed a decent meal, but civilisation in the regular fashion was far away, and there was hardly any cell reception.LindaProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

The beaten track was busy, so we took every opportunity to deviate off it along alternative sections. Walking across the Meseta, the expansive, high central plateau famed for its isolation, we took the detour from Calzada del Coto to Mansilla de las Mulas along the Via Trajana, the old, cobbled Roman road. We were surrounded by birdsong, wildflowers and the ghosts of legionaries. Apart from when we stopped for a comfortable night and an immense breakfast at theVia Trajana hostelin Calzadilla de los Hermanillos, we only saw two other people in two days and 20 miles of walking.RichardBears and wolves in the Romanian forestView image in fullscreenA brown bear in the Carpathian forest.Photograph: Roland Brack/AlamyThe Carpathian forests of Romania, flanked by brooding mountains, are a brilliant place to lose yourself for a couple of weeks. On my hiking trip there last summer I spotted brown bears, wolves and lynx as I marched through valleys and woods. I came across medieval towns and villages that are rich in traditional folklore. One highlight was sampling local cheese and singing songs with villagers in the Barza valley. I was rewarded – or punished – for my musical efforts with a bumpy ride on a horse-drawn cart to the next village. Don’t miss a walk up to Postăvarul peak (1,800 metres) for great views over the area.JoeA hike through Iceland’s myriad landscapesView image in fullscreenThe Thórsmörk valley.Photograph: Oleh_Slobodeniuk/Getty ImagesThirty-five miles and three nights in mountain huts in the southern highlands of Iceland: theLaugavegur trailis a microcosm of the landscapes of that incredible country. Geothermal springs, high-altitude snowfields, multicoloured rhyolite mountains, black sand deserts and otherworldly moonscapes. Finally, the magical valley of Thórsmörk – Thor’s Valley – amid birch woods enclosed by three glaciers. Staying in mountain huts means you’ll feel part of a multicultural, international community of travellers, with the warmth and camaraderie this entails, with tales exchanged and memories made.Bill Duncanskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lastovo is a dark skies island and we loved seeing the Milky Way sparkle so brightly. Most of the island is forested and the place remains very undeveloped, as a result of being reserved for the Yugoslav army until 1988. It’s a natural paradise of pine-scented trails leading to quiet beaches and interesting flora and fauna. It can be reached by frequent ferries from Dubrovnik and Korčula.David Innes-WilkinWinning tip: The big beasts of Bieszczady in PolandView image in fullscreenA red deer stag.Photograph: Szymon Bartosz/AlamyI went on a hiking tour to see large mammals in Bieszczady national park in south-east Poland in 2022 and it was amazing – gorgeous landscapes, wild bison, red deer, wolves, brown bears, lynx and wild boar.

I find it impossible to be anywhere near Chinatown in London without ordering one, and the brown sugar milk tea flavour is my go-to. The “bubble” refers to the balls of tapioca that are cooked until chewy, a texture I find so pleasing; if you likemochi, this will be right up your street.Bubble tea ice-cream sundaesYou should be able to find quick-cook tapioca pearls in most large Asian supermarkets; I tend to avoid the plain white tapioca pearls because they can take more than an hour to cook.Prep5 minCook20 minServes4150g quick-cook brown sugar tapioca100g light brown sugar2 English breakfast tea bags100ml double cream½ tsp flaky sea salt8 scoopsvanilla ice-creamChocolatesprinkles orshavings,to serveBring a saucepan of water to a boil, add the tapioca pearls and cook for three to four minutes, until they’ve got a chew to them but are still a little firm. Drain the pearls into a sieve, then run them under the cold tap to stop them sticking together.To make the tea syrup, put the sugar, 75ml water and the tea bags in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer, cook for four to five minutes, until the liquid reduces by about a quarter, then remove and discard the tea bags.Turn down the heat to medium-low, add the tapioca, then stir well to coat. Take off the heat and leave to cool in the pan. (You can do this in advance and leave at room temperature overnight.)To make the salted cream, lightly whip the double cream and salt to very soft peaks.To serve, put a spoonful of the tapioca and syrup mix into a sundae glass or ramekin, then swirl it around so some of the syrup coats the inside. Layer it with a scoop or two of ice-cream and some more tapioca and syrup. Top with a dollop of the salted cream followed by chocolate sprinkles or shavings, and serve.Explore more on these topicsIce-cream and sorbetThe sweet spotDessertFoodTeaChocolaterecipesShareReuse this content"

Everything is cooked in just two roasting tins and is on the table in half an hour, yet it’s a dish that looks impressive and livens up any meal.A panzanella is a Tuscan tomato salad traditionally made with stale bread, but I’ve given it an indulgent twist and used Tesco Finest sourdough for its tangy taste and airy texture. I like this warm version where the tomatoes are roasted until juicy and the bread is crisped in the oven before everything is mixed together and finished with Tesco Finest buffalo mozzarella from the Campania region, bringing a creamy texture and fresh flavour to the dish.This recipe makes the most of the tomatoes, which are at their best at this time of year.
