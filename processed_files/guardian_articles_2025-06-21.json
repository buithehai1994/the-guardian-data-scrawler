Now, with a highly anticipated Glastonbury slot, the California-dwelling earth mother is ready to let rip again …Sat 21 Jun 2025 06.45 EDTShareAlanis Morissette asks which version of herI wish to hear from: “The hormonal bitch who has a lot to say? The people-pleasing, kind, amenable part? They’re all here.” It’s 9am in sunny Los Angeles and the ­Canadian-born singer-songwriter is ­wearing a slouchy top, her wavy hair loose. She’s long been aware of these different“parts”, that her life is full of contradiction. “I have 14 different opinions about one thing.” It’s why, aged 19, she wrote Hand In My Pocket (lyrics include:I’m high, but I’m grounded/ I’m sane, but I’m ­overwhelmed), one of several anthems on Jagged ­Little Pill, the album released 30 years ago this month. Back then, in the unenlightened 90s, people found this sort of talk unnerving. “They were like, ‘Whoa, that’s scary. What are you talking about?’”“They called it my ‘psychobabble’. I’m like, ‘I’m going to stay the course with my psychobabble.’” It’s what she sees as her “karmic assignment” and feels not a little vindicated now that these ideas are welcomed by the mainstream. There’s a whole seam of psychotherapy that views the mind as composed of distinct “parts”, called Internal Family Systems. Morissette speaks at the symposiums, as well as summits on trauma, or wholeness verses wellness, career, art and feminism. She hosted a podcast devoted to this stuff. “The healing arts,” she says, adding drily: “I am from California, never forget that. California, because if I were in any other state my head might explode.”Morissette hair-whipped into our consciousness, a waif with a wide smile belting raw honesty in an outsized mezzo-soprano, with You Oughta Know. It wasn’t just the “psychobabble” that caused consternation. It was the unsettling range of female emotion, the androgyny, the ‘monstrous feminine’. “I used to say, ‘I’m on the frontlines, I get my head chopped off.’” Jimmy Fallon compared her to a troll doll. Rolling Stone called her “rage-filled”, put her on theNovember 1995 coverwith the headline Angry White Female. Purists cleared their throats over the use of “ironic” in her track of that title. The New York Times declared the things she described – “a black fly in your chardonnay”, “rain on your wedding day” – “distinctlyunironic”. Morissette said yes, she was sometimes “the malapropism queen”. But her fans understood. And 33m of them bought Jagged Little Pill, so.Since then, she’s sold 75m records, released 10 albums, most recently The Storm Before the Calm, featuring 11 guided meditations. She’s acted in films, led healingworkshops, raised awareness on issues such as sex abuse, postpartum depression, disordered eating, addiction. We’ve met because this Friday evening she will step on to Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage. She’s never been to Glastonbury – which seems incredible; in so many ways she might have been hatched in a tent in the Healing Field – but as an artist, she says, “It was bucket-listy.”View image in fullscreenMorissette at John Anson Ford theater in Hollywood, California, in 1995.Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic, IncShe’s grateful to still be able to perform work from her 30-year oeuvre without compromising herself. It’s because she still believes every lyric, she says, “value systems-wise and in terms of passions”. There’s only one she’s iffy about. It’s a song about partnerships called Not the Doctor, which says, essentially, “I don’t want to worry about your stuff. Your stuff is your stuff. My stuff’s my stuff. Never the twain shall meet.” She pulls a face. “Now I’ve been married 15 years, I’m like, Oh, the twain shall meet. The twain are very much meeting every day.”This morning she’s at her desk in the home she shares with the rapper Souleye (whom she met at a meditation retreat in 2009) and their three children, sons Ever, 14, and Winter, five, and daughter Onyx, nine. Also in the house, “so many dogs and animals, holy fuck”. The camera her end tips up from time to time creating a sensation for me of being capsized.Ifirst met Morissette five years ago when she was in London for the launch of her album Such Pretty Forks in The Road. She was breastfeeding her youngest, then a few months old, and grappling with “lacto-menopause” (What’s that? “It’s a fucking shitshow”). My takeaway then: Morissette doesn’t do half measures, but she does do gallows humour. She had been living in Berkeley, California, enjoying the community spirit, people dropping round with smoothies and hot soup. She found the microclimate calming on her nervous system when the energy in LA got too much. “There’s a lot of unfinished trauma in LA,” she told me then.Before moving to Berkeley, she’d been in the western suburbs of LA for 24 years. They then lived in Malibu, but were driven out by fires in 2019. She has occasionally tried to live outside the state, “briefly” on Bowen Island, Vancouver. And she tried New York for a year. “But that Pacific Ocean, it keeps pulling me back,” she says. Yup, she’s “a Californian girl through and through”.By January this year, they had been living in Pacific Palisades in LA for just a few months when thewildfirestore through their neighbourhood, writing off their house and 85% of their belongings. More than 200,000 people were displaced. Many of her friends fled to New York, whole communities upped sticks.It was the ocean, the communal living vibe, the generalfeeling the feelsthat made her want to stay in California. The family initially found a temporary solution, living “communally” with four friends between January and May. About a month ago, Morissette worked “feverishly” to find the house she’s in now, a block from where she used to live, surrounded by hills, “room-mating indefinitely” with a friend who lost his home in Altadena, north LA.She says a heaviness persists in the city, “a grief”. She avoids the devastated areas, even if it means taking long detours, “because when you drive through Sunset all the way down, it’s still surreality”. She says her mind can’t compute what her eyes are seeing. And the beach is out, because any time she contemplates going in the water she remembers, “it’s likely filled with toxins” from the ash. “It’s a different city now, but it’s always a cool city. I’m pretty in love with Los Angeles.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Shelby DuncanA few days after we speak, the city lit up again, this time with protests against Donald Trump’s immigration raids, whichspread across the countryafter the US president’s deployment of the national guard. The night before Morissette and her family left for Norway for the first date of her summer tour, a curfew was imposed by the LA mayor.I ask about living in Trump’s America, and she says (with a touch of sarcasm) that she was looking forward to this part of the conversation. “The gift of travelling the planet is I get glimpses of how the international community perceive America,” she says. She has a way of summing up how Canadians respond to rudeness. They are, “Nice, nice, nice. Then piss us off on the wrong day and we explode.” Is this prime minister Mark Carney’s way of doing business with Trump? She laughs. “It becomes a hard no. We try to be amenable, but then it’s a very hard no. Unequivocal. So that’s kind of our thing, culturally. We came by it honestly.”Morissette’s tour will take in cities all over Europe including London, Dublin, Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow. She says when she’s touring, she’s pretty nocturnal, going to bed as late as 4am. Mornings are sharpened with a bulletproof coffee and she practises “intuitive” intermittent fasting. When she’s at home, she “putters – you know, organising and cleaning with no agenda. I’ll get back to you on what that means neurobiologically.” She says her awareness is “diffuse” while she does this, which is “instantly feminine”.“You can be aware that your child just stubbed his toe, the dog needs his food, the husband needs a snug. That’s the divine feminine capacity.” Her mentor, the late author and addiction specialist Pia Mellody, once said vacuuming was her spiritual practice. “I was like, ‘That’s mine, too!’ So, if you see a clean environment, it means I was meditating.”While we talk, her husband, whose real name is Mario Treadway, is padding about somewhere in the house. He’s released nine albums, and there’s some thematic crossover with his wife in terms of an interest in spirituality, “inner child work” and mental health (he lost an older brother to suicide). Certainly, from the outside – see Instagram – their home is a sweet, functioning environment. He’s the kind of husband who wears a Patriarchy Hurts Us All T-shirt and makes juices (spinach, celery and lemon) for breakfast before shouldering his share of the children’s home schooling. As musicians, they “make sense to each other”, Morissette says. “I’m not strange to him. I’m not weird or freakish.”But they put the work in. She can’t imagine how relationships manage without couples counselling. “I’m a huge couples therapist person. I have been for ever.” Her non-negotiable is that the therapist be “trauma-informed” and “addiction-informed”. “I can’t be supported by someone who doesn’t look through those lenses.”Any addiction, if we keep going with it, we’re dead. It is great for 20 minutes, then you’re deadShe’s long been frank about addiction, deliberately so. “I call addiction ‘relief-seeking measures that kill you eventually’.” Work, love, sex and shopping, “those are the chestnuts” for her. They are “Whac-a-Mole”, in that as soon as she’s bashed one, another pops up. Being a workaholic is “especially” hard. “Because the number one priority is being clicked into some seed of productivity. There’s no worth in justbeing. And it’s a higher power thing, so work addiction is also called the praise addiction.”For instance: “If I said, ‘Oh, I did heroin till four in the morning and totally blacked out,’ people would be like, ‘Oh shit. Bitch needs some help.’But if I said, ‘I’ve been working my fucking ass off for this deadline and I finished at 4.15am,’ people would be patting my back and be, like, ‘Good work, girl.’ It’s equally corrosive. Because any addiction, if we keep going with it, we’re dead. It is great for 20 minutes, then you’re dead.”She’s joking about the “20 minutes” and at the same time very much not joking about the “dead”. She describes herself as part of the 20% of the population who are “highly sensitive” as well as part of the 4% who are “empaths” – meaning she’ll walk into a room porous to everyone else’s issues, pain and general unresolved junk. It’s a cursed trait, she says. Society loves the “yield” of the sensitive person: “They love the songs, the photos, the art. But they don’t love the human.” Without therapy, she “would not be alive”.She was suicidal? “All the time. I still struggle with it. I have an anxious, depressive tendency. Those who are sensitive are much more susceptible to their environmental information. If you put a highly sensitive person in an environment where they’re brow-beaten or reduced, they’ll basically want to kill themselves. It’s the worst. If you put a highly sensitive person in an environment where they’re supported, championed and listened to, they thrive.”For her own children, Morissette has tried to create an environment where their “multiple intelligences” are nurtured. A word about “multiple intelligences” for the uninitiated. It’s a theory developed by the US psychologist Howard Gardner, who identified eight different types of intelligences alongside the old “academic, sit in your chair and get good grades in a test” type. Morissette is a fierce advocate of the intelligences. I’ll let her take it from here: “My job has always been to understand an entire model through clinical training and otherwise, and then update it. Expand it. So when I interviewed Gardner on the podcast, I said, ‘Can I update the multiple intelligences?’ And he said, ‘You can do whatever you want, Alanis.’”“So now I have 16 intelligences. Not only do I use that as a template when I’m home schooling, but I also use it as a template if friends come to me worried about their kids. Or if we’re talking about the conventional curriculum in public schools, or what the government’s up to with education. I constantly reference multiple intelligences, because so many kids say, ‘I’m really dumb.’ And it kills me. I’m just like, ‘What do you mean? Where are your intelligences? Where do you spark up? Where do you jump out of bed in the morning?’ And it might be physical intelligence. It might be that you’re meant to do backflips in a way that I’ll never do. I’ll need a stunt double for that. So I go through it with anybody who’s across from me and seeking support.”She calls home school “unschool”, and the kids are allowed to opt into the mainstream the moment they choose. Ever, for instance, chose to go at seventh grade. I ask her to give me a flavour. “Like, Winter will be singing to us his whole day, channelling his stream of consciousness. And then Onyx is twirling around the room. Artistry as a way of life is so normalised in our family. It’s not like if one person’s loving their academic moment, that isn’t recognised. If someone’s loving the backflip they just mastered, we’re like, ‘Awesome!’ So there is a celebration of process here. Destination is fun, butprocessis everything. We value that here.”View image in fullscreenOn stage in Paris with her husband Souleye, 2012.Photograph: David Wolff/Patrick/Redferns/Getty ImagesMorissette calls the people who help the family the “caregiving gang”, certainly a nicer way of putting it than “nannies and tutors”. Everybody in that gang knows about the multiple intelligence system. “What I’ve done is laminated maps and posters to indicate what each might look like. For example, musical intelligence might look like Souleye in the studio writing a song. He’ll bring Onyx in, and she’ll write a song, and he’ll record it.”Naturalist intelligence is another. The family have a farm in northern California where they keep cows, turkeys, ducks, snakes “and tons of chickens. Onyx is super knowledgable, to the point where, when I don’t know a thing about an animal, I just turn to her. So we’ve got our naturalist intelligence there, our animal empath. I can’t even keep a plant alive.”She loves the tranquillity of the farm, the peaceful escape. “I love anywhere where there’s a vortex,” she says. For a second, I think:vortex?The internet informs me that there’s an alternative definition. A vortex in this context is “a state of alignment with one’s desires and source energy”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s a linguistic issue.” She loves words, loves using them, “but sometimes I play with them a little much”. She’ll create words – tangentalise, decohesify – that intuitively seem to fit.How does she talk to her kids about the postpartum depression she experienced after all three were born? “I apologise all the time. They’ll say, ‘I remember that whole era,’ and I’ll say, ‘Well, I wasn’t exactly available to show up for you in the full way that I wanted to.’ I am pretty transparent about how I failed them. And my running joke, which is not a joke, is that I have accounts set up for their potential college fees, if that’s the route they take, but I also have whole accounts set up for their therapy, because they’re going to need it.”View image in fullscreenPlaying in Budapest, 2008.Photograph: Karoly Arvai/ReutersMy hair is a band mate. It’s a way of expressing and flailing and raging. It’s a friend who protects me when I’m feeling vulnerable on stageShe says interest in postpartum depression is better than it was, say, 30 years ago. “But ‘interest’ isn’t salve. Being interested in someone’s suffering isn’t the same as showing up for it. There’s not a lot of education around anything feminine, but this one especially. So, it’s rugged. But I really consider myself a sort of existential cockroach. There’s a tenacity – I don’t know where it comes from, probably my parents – to keep going.” She puts on a voice here of someone asking a question after the birth of Winter, when she was 45: “‘Why would you get pregnant again if you’ve already been through it twice and it gets progressively worse?’ I’m like, ‘Well, look at my children. I’ll do anything for these kids. To meet them, even, I’ll suffer anything.’” She pauses then adds: “It’s also a generation X thing. We’re known for our white-knuckle approach to fricking everything.”She’s tugging the ends of her hair. I should say something about her hair. It’s still long, brown, middle-parted and what the kids would call iconic in the way Janis Joplin’s was, too. Morissette helicoptered it on stage, semi-dreaded it in You Learn, wore it as her only clothes in her video for Thank U. “I mean, my hair is a band mate,” she says. “It’s a way of expressing and flailing and raging. It’s like a typewriter, it speaks on my behalf. Without me, even. It’s a friend who protects me when I’m feeling vulnerable on stage. If you have 80,000 or 200,000 people looking, a well-placed moment of deep” – she mimes retreating behind her hair – “and then I’m back” – she mimes re-emerging – “It’s a pretty way of hiding. The perfect tool for an introvert. And I’ve always felt androgynous, so in some ways my earrings or my hair length can remind someone that it’s a female body.”She doesn’t mind when it’s long and greasy, she likes the “aesthetic of dirty chic” (I fear Glastonbury may test even the steeliest Californian). Plus, her hair supplied a fierce and tangible shift from the way she’d been moulded as a child star back home in Canada.Born in Ottawa, Alanis Morissette was one of three children of teachers Alan Morissette and Georgia Feuerstein; her mother’s family escaped the Hungarian revolution when she was 10. “Basically, they were on a train, someone leaned over and said, ‘Hey, we just want to let you know that every family getting off at the next stop is being taken away to be killed. Your family might want to jump off.’ They did, looked back from the field, and saw everyone being executed.”Morissette has an older brother Chad, and a twin, Wade. By all accounts she was a child in constant motion, always spinning, singing. “My twin brother used to joke he would be playing soccer while I was writing songs about fate,” she has said. She tells me two clear things about her early life. One that she had a “prophetic” vision of herself travelling the planet and singing. “That’s what I saw as a very young person.” The second is that her “psychological leanings” were always there. “We all have our funny roles in our family, and my role was the ‘psyche understander’ and the conflict resolver. Some might think that made me the peacemaker, but really, I was just the family therapist. Which is exciting, but also horrifying.” (Does she still have that role? She laughs. “I quit.” She mimes handing out other therapists’ numbers, “Here’s a couple of business cards.”)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Shelby DuncanAt the age of 10, Morissette – Lady Di hairdo and roll-up jeans – appeared in five episodes of the Nickelodeon kids’ series You Can’t Do That on Television. She used the money she earned to make her first album. At the same time, she was a competitive swimmer with a punishing training schedule. Not long after, she was signed by MCA, who turned her into a cringy pop princess bopping with Paula Abdul-style dance moves in a crucifix and bra top. She even opened for rapper Vanilla Ice. She was cutting records in studios until 3am and still attending school – even if the classroom desk was just a chance to catch up on sleep.Behind the teen gloss, of course, were the predatory men, the exploitative financial deals, the criticisms about her looks and weight. All this, in an era that celebrated size zero, cemented a severe eating disorder.After high school, she learned to play guitar and started writing songs. Aged 19, she moved to LA and spent her days trying to navigate a culture where no one asked her a question and just writing, writing, writing on the beach. Music was suddenly an outlet. Her lyrics were, “psychologically, spiritually, emotionally informed”. She was signed by Madonna’s label Maverick and Jagged Little Pill was released when she was 21, selling half a million copies in one week. Nonetheless, it was a “rough time” to be a solo artist. “There was no one to hide behind. What I found in terms of the lovely patriarchy, was that at that time if men couldn’t fuck me, they didn’t know what to do with me.”When she looked around her in the musical landscape, the people who seemed successful were “secure in their loudness, à la Courtney Love. That seemed to be valued. I was like, ‘OK, I’m going to pretend to be an extrovert for the next 25 years.’ So, tequila – anything that allowed me to be the life of the party – or if I was doing a talk, Xanax. Anything that would help me pretend I’m not me.”I’m working micro-feminisms into every board meetingShe takes a deep breath and says as if speedily wrapping up, “And that’s why perimenopause is so great, because now there’s zero desire to present as something that I’m not. I spent 25 years trying to be someone who didn’t have this temperament. At 51, I feel this is just what it is like.”She says that menopause is “rough and amazing, both”. She interrupts herself to ask if I know about the micro-feminism trend, “where you just impose the feminine on everything. It’s anything’s like, ‘Oh, I need to talk to a doctor, becauseshe’lltell me … ’ I do it all the time. If someone sees a bug, ‘Oh my gosh,she’sgorgeous.’ Because, obviously, patriarchy would have it be such that every fucking thing is male, including the creatures. I’m working those micro-feminisms into every board meeting.”She hates that the hyper-sexuality of the 90s and 00s is back. That “size zero” is back. “We thought that whole era was done, right? We sorted this out! Didn’t we? Oh, we didn’t. We dropped the ball. The collarbone thing came back in … and the hyper-sexualization thing is so boring.” She laughs: “Of course, a perimenopausal woman’s going to say that, right? My procreative imperative is, thank fucking God, chilling out. There are gorgeous things that come along with that – less people-pleasing, more directness. But I’m still in the middle of it. And that can be disconcerting. Most of my friends are in the middle of it, too, so we cut each other a lot of slack. My menopausal women friends are like, ‘Honey, it gets fucking great.’ It’s the best news.”Morissette believes medicine should embrace all the woo-woo, including psilocybin (the hallucinogenic compound found in some mushrooms) or MDMA treatments for PTSD. “I think it’s all fantastic. The future in medicine – pharma is not maybe going to be so happy hearing this – is prevention, heading things off at the pass; understanding things hormonally, emotionally, circumstantially, relationally to past traumas. So that includes microdosing, ketamine, or whatever you need to do. We’ve come a long way; people know how to do this now, so I’m excited.”Does this mean her view of sobriety is nuanced? “There are some people who would get very mad at me for implying at all that it’s nuanced. Because for those of us who were drinking at seven in the morning, well there’s nothing nuanced about that. So, I guess it depends. For me, it’s whichever addiction is bringing you to death very fast. Which one is it? Which one’s ruining your relationships? And then there’s the Whac-a-Mole approach, which is, ‘OK, I’ve stopped not eating. And now I’m working my ass off. Oh, yeah, and I took a few too many pills.’ The Whac-a-Mole, that’s what we have to keep an eye on.”She’s looking ahead to Glastonbury, which is part of what she calls her “summer of communalism”. She’ll be travelling with her family and ever-expanding caravan of friends. When she takes to the stage, that long hair billowing, she expects to be wide-eyed, taking in the crowd in front of her, and “beholding the shit out of everything”.Tickets for Alanis Morissette’s European tour are available to buyhere.In the UK,Action on Addictionis available on 0300 330 0659.In the US, call or textSAMHSA’s National Helpline at 988.

Is it best to stay away from next summer’s Trump-Infantino US World Cup? Depending on your politics the answer may be a resoundingnoor a bemused shrug. Some will see pure drive-by entertainment. Why would anyone want to boycott a month-long end-of-days Grand Soccer Parade staged by two of the world’s most cinematic egomaniacs?But it is a question that has been asked, and will be asked a lot more in the next year. Those who intend to travel will need to answer it by action or omission. Would it be better for dissenting media and discomfited football fans to simply no-platform this event?The picture is at least clearer now. After a week of the new steroid-fedClub World Cupwe know what this thing will feel like and who it will benefit. There is no mystery with these events now, no sense of politics lurking coyly out of sight.UnderGianni InfantinoFifa has become a kind of mobile propaganda agency for indulgent regimes, right out in front twirling its pompoms, hitching its leotard, twerking along at the front of the parade like an unholy Uncle Sam.So we had thegrisly sight this week of Donald Trumpnot just borrowing football’s light, but wrestling it on to his lap and ruffling its hair, burbling like a random hot-button word generator about women and trans people, while Juventus players gawped in the background.0:42Trump asks Juventus players during White House visit whether a woman would make their team – videoWe have the spectacle of both club and international football hijacked as a personal vanity platform for Infantino, the dictator’s fluffer, the man who sold the world not once but twice.Infantino’s status as a wildly over-promoted administratorhas always had an operatic quality. But there is something far more sinister in his political over-reach, out there nodding along at the latest Oval Office freak-off, helping to legitimise each divisive statement, each casual erasure of process.Nobody gaveFifaa mandate to behave like this. Its mission is to promote and regulate. And yet here is it acting as a commercial disruptor in its own sport and as a lickspittle to the powerful, disregarding the human rights fluff and political neutrality enshrined in its “statutes”, offering zero transparency or accountability.View image in fullscreenLionel Messi’s fame has added a lustre to the Club World Cup but the tournament is hardly noticeable in the US outside the stadiums.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersTo date Infantino’s only public interface in the US is a “fireside chat”, AKA approved PR interview, at the Dick’s Sporting Goods stage in New York. There he is, up there on the Stage of Dick’s, mouthing platitudes to pre-programmed questions, high on his own power supply, the newly acquired Gianni glow-up eyebrows arched in a patina of inauthenticity. They say celebrity is a mask that eats into the face. Take a look at what football can do to you.And so far this tournament has presented the full grotesquery in store. What is the Club World Cup like on the ground? Pretty much the same as it is on the screen given this event is invisible in physical form beyond the stadiums.The key takeaway is confirmation of the weirdly jackboot, cult-like nature of the Infantino-shaped universe. Even the optics are trying to tell you something, all black holes, hard surfaces, gold, power-flash.Why does Fifa have its own vast lighted branding on the pitch like a global super-corporation or a military dictatorship? What is the Club World Cup logo supposed to represent, with its weird angular lines, the void at its heart? An obscure Stalinist plug socket? Darth Vader’s space fighter? Not to mention the bizarre obsession with that shapeless and indefinable trophy, present on the big screen in every ground in weird scrolling closeup, one minute a Sauron’s eye, the next some kind of finger-snapping torture instrument, with its secret draws full of ectoplasm, a dead crow, the personal effects of Pol Pot.Mainly there is the very openly manipulative nature of the spectacle, football in its final dictator form, with a sense of utter disdain for its captive consumer-subjects. Yes, they will literally put up with anything if we pipe it into their smartphones. So here is beauty, love, colour, connection, the things you’re hard-wired to respond to, cattle-prodded into your nervous system for the benefit of assorted interests. Here is football reimagined as a kind of mass online pornography. Fifa even calls its media website Fifahub.View image in fullscreenWhy does Fifa have its own vast lighted branding on the pitch like a global super-corporation or a military dictatorship?Photograph: Marco Bello/ReutersWith all this in mind some have suggesteda World Cup and US boycottis the correct and logical response, not least in two recent articlespublished in these pages. The organisation Human Rights Watch has carried a warning about the implications of staging the tournament under the Trump regime. Guardian readers and social media voices have asked the same question from all sides of discourse.The hostile versions of this: if you don’t like it then just don’t come, we don’t want you anyway [expletives deleted]. If you were worried about us in Qatar, western imperialist, why are you going to the US? And from the liberal left a concern that to report on sport is also to condone a regime that sends deportation officers to games, imposes travel bans on Fifa members and is edging towards another remote war.And all the while marches football around in a headlock, snapping its underwear elastic, saying thanks, Gianni, for the distracting firework show.This is not a normal situation. So why normalise it? Why give it legitimising light and heat? And yet, one week into the World Cup’s rehearsal dinner, the only logical response is: you just have to go. Not only would a boycott serve no practical purpose; it would be counterproductive, an act of compliance for a regime that will happily operate without an opposing voice on the stage.There are two structural reasons for this. And a third that relates to the United States itself, or at least to the idea of the United States, to its possibilities, which are not defined by Trump, by the latest military action, or by Infantino.Most obviously, if you leave the stage you abandon the argument to the other person. Dissent remains a useful commodity. However pointless, ineffective and landlocked the process of pointing out the flaws and contradictions may have become, it is necessary to keep doing so. Qatar 2022 was a dictator show that simply sailed above the criticisms. But someone, however minor, has to make them, to offer at least some kind of counter-view.No-platforming an autocrat’s show makes no sense on a basic level. These people would prefer you weren’t there in any case. Whereas in reality the people platforming and enabling Trump and Infantino are not journalists trying to give another version of events, but the people who keep voting them into power, friendly dictators, subservient football associations and client media who will be present whatever happens.View image in fullscreenRumours of raids outside the stadiums at the Club World Cup by ICE, the US immigration agency, has added a sinister tone to the tournament.Photograph: Jonathan Alcorn/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockFifa and its Saudi-backed broadcast partner Dazn are glossing up an army of in-house influencers and content-wanglers to generate a wall of approving noise. Is it healthy if these are the only voices at the show? Shouting into a void may have little effect. But you still have to shout.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is why it is coveted, courted and used like a weapon. Last week these pages carnied alogical, entirely legitimate wider view, written by two academics from City University New York, which concluded that a boycott was not just an option but “necessary”.At the same time, the article defined the football World Cup as something that basically has no value, “spectacles of recreation designed to distract people from their day-to-day lives, cultural and political branding opportunities for their hosts. For authoritarians, they have long been used as a tool to distract from or launder stains of human rights violations and corruption.”Which is definitely true. But it also reads like a vision of sport defined by the most joyless version of AI invented. Under this version of events no World Cup or Olympics would have taken place, because they are essentially worthless, home only to malevolent actors, lacking any notion of colour, human spirt, joy, art, beauty or connection.Who knows, maybe this is accurate now. It is undeniably true that the idea of football as a collective people’s game is fairly absurd. Fans of football clubs struggle with this state of cognitive dissonance on a daily basis, the contrast of legacy identity and hard commercial reality. Liverpool are a community club owned by a US hedge fund. Manchester City see themselves as outsiders and underdogs, and are also owned by the Abu Dhabi royal family. Football is the enemy these days.But both sides of this are important, because without that emotional connection, without the act of faith that enables the warm, human part, everything becomes diminished, all our institutions toxic shells. To give up is to abandon sport for ever to the dictators and the sales people, to say, yeah, this just belongs to you now. No-platforming something that still means connection and culture and history. Are we ready for that yet? There will be another version of the present at some point.View image in fullscreenDespite the political issues surrounding the tournament, some of the games in the Club World Cup so far have had good atmospheres.Photograph: Jae C Hong/APThe final point is about the US, a deeply divided and unhappy place right now, and a much-derided host nation, not least by members of its own populace. What has it been like here? The evidence is that an actual World Cup is going to be very hard to negotiate, spread over vast spaces, with baffling travel times, unreliable infrastructure, and a 24-hour attention industry that is already busy gorging on every other spectacle available to the human race.The US has a reputation for peerless razzmatazz around public events. And while this is undeniably true with cultural spectacles it invented – rock’n’roll, presidential races, galactic shopping malls, enormous food, rural tornadoes, its own continental-scale sports – the US’s version of other people’s specialities, from cheese to professional football, can seem a little mannered.But the fact remains the actual games have been quite good. There has been a European-flavoured focus on tickets and empty seats. But 25,000 people on a weekday to watch Chelsea in an ill-defined game is decent evidence of willingness to stage this thing and develop the market.The dismay at 3,500 turning up to Mamelodi Sundowns v Ulsan HD in Orlando overlooks the upside, the fact that 3,500 people actually turned up to Mamelodi Sundowns v Ulsan HD in Orlando. Sundowns get 9,000-odd even at home. How many of their South African fans can afford to travel for this? Fifa, which uses its faux-benevolence cleverly, will point out an African team received $2m (£1.7m) for winning that game. Do we want to develop something or not?A wider point is that football here is a game beloved of immigrant populations. There is a different kind of warmth, often among people without a platform or the means to make it to the matches so far. The waiter who adores Cristiano Ronaldo. The taxi driver who wants to talk for 40 minutes about Chelsea’s wastefulness with academy players. The cop who loves the Colombian national team and is desperate for his son to see them in the flesh.As for the US itself, it still feels like false equivalence to state that this is now an actual dictatorship, a lost land, a place that doesn’t deserve this show because of its flaws and structural violence. This has always been a pretty brutal nation, human life as a constant pressure wave, mainlining heat and light into your veins, but also always taking a bite.The opening week in Miami captured this feeling, football’s most hungrily transactional event staged on a sunken green peninsula, a place where the sea seems to be punching holes in the land, but which is still constantly throbbing with life and warmth and beautiful things.View image in fullscreenEmpty seats at lots of stadiums have become a prominent issue during the Club World Cup.Photograph: Mike Segar/ReutersThere is a nostalgic attachment to the idea of the US for people of a certain age, 20th-century holdovers, brought up on its flaws and imperialism, but also its culture and brilliance. But for the visitor America does seem in a worse state than it did 20 years ago. There is an unhappiness, a more obvious underclass, a sense of neglected parts and surfaces. All the things that were supposed to be good – cars, plenitude, markets, voting, empowerment, civil rights, cultural unity, all the Cokes being good and all the Cokes being the same – seem to have gone bad.But this is also a democracy with an elected leader, albeit one with a lust for executive power and some sinister tendencies. Mainly the US seems to have a massive self-loathing problem. Perhaps you can say it is correct in this, that Trump is enacting actual harms. But Trump is also a symptom of that alienation and perceived decline. He’s an algorithm-driven apparition. Say his name enough times and this cartoon will appear. America remains a great, messy, dangerous, flawed idea of a place. What else is the world currently offering?This is in any case where football will now live for the next year, an unquestioning supplicant in the form of its own autocratic leader. The game is not an indestructible product. It can be stretched thin and ruined by greed, is already at war with itself in many key places. It will at some point be necessary to pay the ferryman, even as the US is packed away a year from now and the sails set at Fifa House for all corners of the globe and then Saudi Arabia. However stormy the prospects, it is not quite the moment to abandon this ship for good.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupFifaDonald TrumpGianni InfantinoFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The 40-year-old billionaire founder and CEO of the messaging app Telegram revealed last year–in a post on his own app– that while he isn’t married and prefers to live alone, he has over 100 biological children in 12 countries via sperm donation.Durov’s reproductive choices madeheadlinesagain this week after the tech tycoon told the French political magazineLe Pointthat he is going to leave his fortune, estimated at almost $14bn, to all of his children. Durov has six children he fathered naturally with three different partners as well as the children he has via sperm donation.“They are all my children and will all have the same rights. I don’t want them to tear each other apart after my death,” he told Le Point.What possessed Durov, who wascharged last year in Franceover allegations that Telegram is being used for illicit activity, to populate the world with so many mini-mes? (Hehas denied failing to cooperatewith authorities and Telegram has denied having poor moderation.) Well, like Elon Musk and a number of other tech types, Durov is a pronatalist who is worried about global fertility rates declining. He’s chosen to take a hands-on approach to tackling the issue, fundingfree IVF treatmentsfor women at AltraVita IVF Clinic inMoscowfor anyone who uses his sperm. If you’re interested, and I’m sure that a lot of people will be now that Durov has laid out the terms of his will, he’s still gotsperm on ice at the clinic.Durov first donated his sperm over 15 years ago, in order to help a friend. Then, he said in hisTelegrampost last year, he realised he ought to donate more widely. “The boss of the clinic told me that ‘high quality donor material’ was in short supply and that it was my civic duty to donate more sperm to anonymously help more couples,” Durov said in the post. Durov added that he wants to “help destigmatize the whole notion of sperm donation and incentivize more healthy men to do it.”Having used a sperm donor to conceive my own child, I’m all for destigmatizing sperm donation. Particularly as there is amajor lack of sperm donorsamong certain demographics: at one point last year, for example, there were only adozen Black sperm donorsat the four main cryobanks in the US.But, and this is a very bigbut,there is an enormous difference between destigmatizing artificial insemination and one person thinking it is their “civic duty” to conceive 100-plus children. Allowing a single individual to procreate so prolifically raises complex ethical issues. There’s the possibility of accidental incest in the future, as well as the potential psychological impact that stems from someone discovering they have 100 siblings. There are also potential medical problems:earlier this year it was reportedthat the sperm of a man with a rare cancer-causing mutation was used to conceive at least 67 children.Is Durov even allowed to donate to so many different couples? The short answer is yes. The law regarding how many children can be conceived from one donor is complicated and varies from country to country. In places like France there are strict national limits while in the US (and Russia) there is no national law limiting the number of donations one person can make. Reputable cryobanks, however, do claim to have their own self-imposed limits. The European Sperm Bank applies aworldwide limitof 75 families for each sperm donor. California Cryobank, one of the largest providers in the US, has said it tries to limit donations toabout 25-30 families.However these cryobanks are also extremelyexpensive, particularly after the pandemic, when shortages meant spermflation kicked in, and there is a completely unregulated market for sperm via Facebook groups and private websites where people can match with potential donors. This has allowed unscrupulous people like Jonathan Jacob Meijer of the Netherlands tofather hundreds of children.As artificial insemination becomes more common, there is a desperate need to better regulate the industry and limit the number of children conceived from a single sperm donor. Indeed, Sweden, along with seven other countries including Belgium,raised the topicwith EU ministers this week. “This issue has been left unresolved for too long,”an official from Belgiumtold POLITICO, adding that an “international limit is a first step in the right direction.”Let’s hope that these limits get put in place sooner rather than later. Because I have an inkling that Elon Musk, who seems to be going alittle off the rails, might take all the chatter about Durov’s progeny as a personal challenge.New Rio law requires public hospitals to display anti-abortion signsThese include messages like: “Did you know that the unborn child is discarded as hospital waste?”The Guardian reportsthat this is the “latest example of a growing trend acrossBrazilto further restrict access to abortion in a country that already has some of the world’s most restrictive laws”.Melanoma cases rise in women under 50The caveat here is that overdiagnosis could be contributing to this increasing.Per Axios, one study “found that routine skin exams have increased and pathologists now more often classify ambiguous lesions as melanoma”.

Due to financial constraints and high unemployment, children don’t leave the parental home until they are, on average, 30 years old. “This means that they postpone forming a couple, become parents quite old and have fewer children,” says Naldini.The state of the labour market also means that men are far less likely to take parental leave. “If you do that as a father, you are seen as not a very trustworthy person,” says Naldini. So typically mothers find themselves becoming the default parent. “This reinforces the gender division of household work, and the father’s participation remains a little bit circumscribed, especially when the children are very young.”This isn’t great for progress, but it’s absolutely brilliant news for me, because I am a) tasked with following the Italian way of parenting, and b) a man. As such, I think Prof Naldini just gave me permission to slack off.Some context: I am the default parent in our household. My wife’s health has been erratic for a number of years, which means the bulk of the parenting work falls to me. School runs, cooking, organising parties and Christmases, buying presents and clothes, remembering dates, being the point person for schools and friends and clubs: it has all been on my shoulders. It is a constant juggle. But on the flipside, it has also been the single most rewarding thing I have ever done. I am extremely tight with my two boys (aged seven and 10), and my inner control freak relishes the responsibility.However, it isn’t very Italian. Although Naldini says that things are shifting – “fatherhood has changed since the 1990s. Fathers play with their children; they try to be intimate; they collaborate in bathing”– but societal expectation is still that the father earns while the mother parents.Obviously, it would be a little callous of me to suddenly dump everything on to my wife for the purposes of an experiment, but that doesn’t mean that a balance can’t be struck. Luckily, this experiment coincides with an uptick in her health, so she is able to take the kids to school in the mornings while I get the jump on work. There’s talk of her taking them to swimming lessons on Saturday mornings so I can sleep in a little.Which isn’t to say that my children seamlessly transition to a more Italian upbringing, as evidenced when we attempt a family-style dinnertime of our adopted country. This involves all of us eating together at the dinner table at 7.30pm. The eating together part is easy – it’s very rare that we don’t do that normally, though more often than not we’re on the sofa with plates on our laps. But a half-seven dinnertime on a school night with two young kids is madness. My kids tend to be asleep by 8pm. An Italian bedtime pushes this back by over an hour. We naively hope for a lie-in, but this does not happen. The result of this is two crankier-than-usual children the following day. Maybe, we decide, we could only be Italian at weekends.“Italy has a very strong family model in terms of intergenerational solidarity,” Naldini tells me. “Grandparents play a strong role in helping to realise the childcare arrangement. That is something that comes from tradition, from the idea of strong solidarity, not between mother and father, but intergenerational.”I have always been extremely bad at asking for help, and especially from my dad. My mum died in 2017, and he was her carer before that, so as far as I’m concerned he has earned the right to spend his retirement however he likes. Prior to this experiment, it had been a couple of years since I’d asked him to look after the kids. But that was the old me. I’m Italian now, and that means he has to do my work for me. Sorry Dad, I don’t make the rules.We have Dad over for Sunday lunch, and this is where I tentatively tell him about the assignment. To my surprise, he responds with something approaching happiness. He thinks it is a great idea for all involved. He gets to see his grandchildren, my kids will benefit from being looked after by someone else for a bit, and my wife and I can spend time together without having to shout over children. So later that week, I drop the kids off with my dad and take my wife to the cinema. We both fall asleep five minutes in. It is great, and now that particular barrier has been removed, we’ll hopefully do it a bit more often.Obviously, in a just world, Italian families would share the workload equally. Employers would have a more enlightened approach to fathers taking parental leave, and the pressure would be taken off women a bit. However, for this specific experiment, it turns out that the Italian way of life suits me more than I expected. For the last five years, I’ve taken on more than I could handle and haven’t asked for help. If nothing else, then being Italian for a week has taught me a problem shared is a problem halved.Grazie mille, Italia.The dos and don’ts of parenting, ItalianstyleDO…Remind your kids that elders should be respected.Be relaxed about bedtimes.They will happen when they happen, and not at the expense of mealtimes.Involve your extended family.As much as possible, if that’s achievable.DON’T …Rely on processed foods at dinner.Take your time and make something from scratch.Skip family mealtimes.Anything you eat, you should all eat together.Overschedule extracurricular activities.Shuttling your kids from swimming lessons to violin practice to karate is far too busy, and not at all Italian.‘We try to get through a day with our child looking immaculate. By lunch, she’s in pants’Lotte Jeffsbecomes a French mamanView image in fullscreenLotte Jeffs with her daughter.Photograph: David Vintiner/The GuardianWhen I was eight and on holiday in France with my parents in 1990, we went out for a meal that none of us have forgotten. An only child, I was being fussy about food and demanded my parents’ play with me. It was then we noticed the French family on the table next to us, with a fellow only child about my age. This girl was compliant, immaculate and eating the same food as everyone else. At one point she accidentally knocked over a glass. Her mother slapped her. According to the French psychotherapist and parenting expert Isabelle Filliozat, this young girl will have probably grown up to become a disciplinarian mother herself. Before it was banned in 2019,85% of French parents admitted to smacking their kidsand, even now, Filliozat says the country’s standard mode of raising children remains “having them comply”.“That’s a pity,” she says. “We can be just together, side by side. That’s how you raise a child. You’re coaching them through life.” I agree. My wife and I are what has been termed “gentle” parents to our six-year-old. It suits our personalities (empathic, nonconfrontational, calm) and the qualities we wish to nurture in our child (kindness, creativity, humour, self-expression).Filliozat wrote a book, Au Cœur des Émotions de L’enfant, in 1999 about centring children’s emotions. Back then, it was seen as a controversial approach in France. It’s more widely adopted today, but not without its detractors. The main naysayer is French child psychologist Caroline Goldman, who has been rising in popularity. She wants to restore hierarchy in the parent-child relationship, because, she says, “Without order, no peace can exist.” In her 2020 book, File dans Ta Chambre! (Go to Your Room), she recommends disciplining children as young as one with “time-outs”. Parent-child disconnection is also common in the country. A study published in the Journal of Marriage and Family shows that the amount of time mothers are spending with their children each day has been increasing globally –apart from in France, where mother-child time declined to about an hour per day.According to Goldman, children should be made to understand that they cannot say whatever they feel, speak too loudly or spill their food deliberately (much emphasis is put on correct behaviour at mealtimes). So, that evening we try to sit around the table together for dinner. The importance of family dining is one thing Filliozat and Goldman agree on. But how can I encourage my energetic six-year-old to stay still for long enough? “Give her small tasks so she can move around, like fetching the water or the bread,” suggests Filliozat. Ha! When I ask my daughter to carry her own glass of water to the table, she gets completely drenched.Filliozat says mealtimes are where families have the best conversations. I agree that family dinners are important, but my wife, daughter and I spend so much of our lives together, that honestly, it’s quite nice to have a moment of peace in the evening. As an experiment, I insist we all eat at 6pm. There’s a lot of cajoling involved, but it’s a nice bonding experience and I vow to make an effort to do this more often.Next, we try to make it through a day with our child looking immaculate. French parenting often involves clear boundaries and expectations, known as “le cadre”. The structure extends to various aspects of a child’s life, including the importance of dressing appropriately for different occasions. I brush my daughter’s hair, button her into a new dress and clean her shoes. We go to her friends’ bowling party and I feel proud that she looks so well put together at 9am on a Sunday. A few hours later, we realise she’s come home in the bowling shoes. By lunchtime, she’s wearing nothing but her pants and running round the garden with friends as we shout the word “Boundaries!!” at her.Finally – the moment I’ve been dreading – it’s time to try being strict. I have to warn my daughter or else she’ll be extremely confused. “Will you have a French accent?” she asks when I give her the context. “Can one Mummy still be a kind Mummy?”Once I give myself permission, it doesn’t take much for me to shout at her to stop faffing around and get into bed. It’s been a long day. I’m surprised by my own loud voice, and the depth of rage I normally keep in check. She starts crying, and I have to leave the room to stop myself apologising. I don’t think anyone’s learned anything from this interaction.Filliozat tells me that as a therapist she’s working with a number of French parents who want to stop shouting at their children. They believe there’s another way, but need help. “This discipline is coming from their past, where their parents shouted at them,” she says. “We shout because of a traumatic memory. To stop that behaviour we need to address our own trauma.”It’s not a great stretch to conflate the backlash to gentle parenting in France to the rise of the far right. “There’s a sense that we need to get power back,” Filliozat says. “There is a lot of insecurity. We had Covid; the economy is going down; the threat of climate change. When you feel insecure, you have a tendency to uphold what you felt was secure.” And that, she suggests, is why some French parents are now doubling down on discipline.I knock on my daughter’s door and apologise for shouting. It was just an experiment, I say. It didn’t work. We agree that scary shouty Maman won’t be coming back.The dos and don’ts of parenting, French styleDO …Set clear boundaries.The French favourle cadre, a firm framework where children know what’s expected of them and what the limits are.Prioritise mealtimes.Kids are taught to sit at the table, and join in conversation – no snacking, no grazing.Value politesse.Manners matter.Childrenlearn to say bonjour, merci and au revoir to every adult, and to shake hands or offer kisses on the cheek when appropriate.DON’T …Negotiate.Parents aren’t peers.

Having a “plan” is important to me, especially because since our children arrived life has become a lot less predictable. While I like to think of myself as a cool parent – I don’t get flustered that often, I can go with the flow – in reality I’m incredibly cautious. I’m usually within catching distance, just in case one of them falls, and immediately imagine the most terrible possible outcome when any form of danger appears. So taking on parenting tips from another country presents a real challenge.My guide to German parenting is Nora Imlau, a journalist who has written multiple bestselling books on the subject. Certain German concepts aren’t going to fly in Casa Bakare, though, like sharing a bed with your kids: considered normal until age seven. I love that for you, Germany, but at the time of the experiment, we’ve just got our 18-month-old into a consistent sleeping routine in her own room, and I’m not jeopardising that for anyone. Thankfully, there are non-sleep related ideas I can take on board.One of the cornerstones of Imlau’s German parenting guidance is not to congratulate your children. Instead I’m supposed to encourage and comment on progress without patronising them by saying such things as, “Well done, darling.” Imlau explains that the Germans try to avoid congratulations because it reinforces the idea that the parent is judging their behaviour constantly. And saying “well done” all the time renders it meaningless. “Tell them that you see what they’re doing without judging it,” says Imlau. “It’s not always about being ‘good’ or the ‘best’. You’re my beloved child because you’re you and not everything you do needs to be ranked.”The problem is, the week of my trial overlaps with the exact time my youngest daughter decides to start walking. While my wife begins shouting with joy as Ayobami edges closer and closer to her first fully fledged steps, I hang back, bottling up my excitement and pride while saying, “Interesting choice of footwork” and, “You are moving toward independence by moving your feet in that manner”, like some sort of clapped-out AI.Not to worry, there are other concepts I can try. Imlau tells me free-range parenting is all the rage in Germany, with a particular focus on letting kids explore. “It’s normal for them to be outside every day in every weather for several hours,” she tells me. It’s a case of sticking them in weather-appropriate clothing and letting them rip. “Of course you try to keep them safe – no one wants a kid to have a concussion,” Imlau adds. “But it’s also seen as a normal part of childhood, that they have bruised knees and get hurt, not in a severe sense, but they fall off a slide and it’s considered normal.”The image of my two daughters – Temilola, aged four, and Ayobami – toppling off the slide at the local park runs through my head, but I stop my waking nightmare and get them dressed. Practical attire only.Gorpcorefor toddlers. We’re not messing around here.Jumping in muddy puddles is an everyday occurrence in Germany, not something you resent Peppa Pig for introducing into your life. I decide to take the girls to our local park, which backs on to a canal that plays host to a surprising amount of wildlife. It’s spitting mildly, but the inclement weather doesn’t stop us. We zip up and head out.At the canal, we spot a moorhen, a coot and a mallard – all of which we feed as a parakeet screeches away overhead. When I give her some bread to throw to the birds, she eats it instead, but I don’t mind, remembering Imlau’s sage advice. “Do whatever you want, enjoy your independence,” I say, even as she ignores my simple instructions.Temilola is on it, though, throwing bits of stale bread into the canal like the condiment-sprinkling chefSalt Bae. We’re moving up and down the towpath, narrowly avoiding cyclists and the occasional jogger. To my pessimistic mind, this feels like a recipe for disaster, but as more birds come – Canada geese, pigeons and gulls – Temilola and Ayobami are getting increasingly excited.We have to head to the local cafe when Temi needs a wee (no congratulations from me, even though she gives me plenty of warning) and when we come out, there’s a heron in the middle of the towpath. A standoff begins as the giant bird refuses to move. Joggers form a queue, while Temi tentatively offers it some muesli. “It’s going to fly away with my daughter,” I say in my head, as it slowly picks at the raisins and oats before walking across the lock, allowing the joggers to file past. Nature is great, letting go is good. I genuinely feel as if I’m learning a lesson here, all thanks to my German friends.There are some key elements of German parenting that are always going to be verboten in our house (our bed is off limits, its defences only breached in absolute emergencies). But a few months on, the more relaxed attitudes to mud, play and general independence are welcome additions to my parenting repertoire. I still catch myself saying “Well done” to my daughters more often than I’d like, but Imlau’s words about how meaningless it can be definitely changed my approach to praise. “British bedtime, a more German daytime” probably sums it up well.The dos and don’ts of parenting, German styleDO …Encourage independence.Nurture your child, so they feel trusted and secure, then as soon as they show they’re ready, let them go! Sleepovers from the age of three are common.Share your bed.Many German parents co-sleep with their kids, often in a huge “family bed”, until the children are about six or seven.Go outdoors in any weather.And not just for a walk in the park: crawling/playing in sand, on grass, in mud and puddles; climbing trees from a very young age; in rain, snow and sleet.DON’T …Sleep train.This is utterly frowned upon, never done at all, and is the very opposite of putting the kid’s emotional wellbeing first.Praise.You can be positive (“I see you’ve used a lot of yellow in that picture – I like it”, for example), as long as it doesn’t veer into overzealousness.‘You only have to look at my kids’ wardrobes to see how pernicious gender stereotypes are’Tim Jonzewarms to the Icelandic wayView image in fullscreenTim Jonze with his children.Photograph: David Vintiner/The Guardian“People often completely misunderstand what we are about,” says Kristín Cardew. She works as a consultant atHjalli, an Icelandic parenting model founded in 1989 that promotes gender equality through what they call a “structured yet unconventional method”.The theory is that society conditions boys and girls differently from birth, and the Hjalli model provides an environment in which to counter this. Girls are encouraged to ask more questions or leap around to help make them more assertive and adventurous; boys are taught to be more gentle and empathic by engaging in activities such as brushing each other’s hair.“Some say we are trying to make the boys ‘girly’,” sighs Cardew. “But we’re not taking anything away from the boys. If they want to play games which are considered ‘boys’ games’, that’s fine. What we are doing is adding things. We are trying to make our children whole people.”The Hjalli model’s aim seems a noble one to me. But the way of breaking down gender boundaries is counterintuitive. Rather than encourage more mixing between the genders, Hjalli separates them from as young as 12 months. They run 14 nursery schools and three secondary schools in Iceland, and Elmwood nursery school in Glasgow, in which children are taught, for most of the time, in single-sex classes.Doesn’t this reinforce stereotypes? Apparently not. “We call it reverse mirroring,” says Cardew. “The boys look at the girls and it reinforces how they think they shouldn’t behave. The girls see the boys maybe being a bit crazy or whatever and say, ‘I don’t want to be like that.’ So when they’re together, they’re learning how not to be. We take them apart and work to give them what traditional society deprives them of.”It would be unrealistic (not to mention pretty damn weird) to employ gender separation in our home – even if my eight-year-old daughter Romy and five-year-old son Teddy might occasionally be quite keen on the idea. But there are plenty of other things the Hjalli model proposes to prevent gender stereotypes holding kids back. These include avoiding gendered language, refraining from complimenting clothes and appearance, encouraging varied types of open-ended play, such as using paint and blocks, and avoiding punishments.“Punishment is never used in our schools, because we are the grownups,” says Cardew. “We are responsible for choosing a suitable environment for the children’s development and for them to flourish in it. If their reaction is questionable, we don’t shame them for it. We need to look at our own decisions and choose a better and more suitable environment for the child, so they can navigate successfully through it, socially, cognitively and emotionally.”This doesn’t mean bad behaviour is excused. “Some children need more assistance to practise different and more appropriate behaviour. So the teacher keeps the child closer to her (or him), at all times, to be able to intervene before the disagreeable behaviour takes place, or chooses a more suitable environment for the child to play in so that the child can practise how to cope in a more conducive manner.”Over the course of a few weeks, I try to adopt some of these principles into my own parenting. The good news for me is that I already do a lot of the things the Hjalli model recommends. The bad news, though, is that there are some things I just think I do already. Take the day out I spend out in Lewisham, south-east London, where my children each choose a toy in a shopping centre. Teddy, the more impulsive one, buys a rainbow handprint maker in the first shop we enter, despite my warnings that he might want to look around elsewhere first. When Romy decides to look in a shop selling cute Japanese toys, Teddy gets upset that he can’t buy anything, so I try to soothe him by saying, “Don’t worry, these things are more for girls.” I’m shocked to hear myself say it. I’ve reached for a gender stereotype as an easy way to get myself out of a tricky situation.You only have to look at my kids’ wardrobes to see how pernicious gender stereotypes are. Teddy’s is a shrine to various characters from the Mario and Sonic universes, whereas as I write this, Romy is wearing a pink top with Mamma Mia! printed in sparkly letters, paired with a pink bag, pink-framed glasses and a glittery skirt. Clothes are a big deal for Hjalli – their kids wear uniforms so children learn to express their identity through other means. I actually appreciate the creative expression that comes with my own kids’ non-school uniform policy, but I understand what Cardew means when she tells me I should refrain from complimenting Romy’s outfits. “Society has this terrible habit of complimenting girls for their looks all the time,” she says. “‘Oh, look at your lovely dress.’ So never compliment her on her looks, because this is how they start identifying themselves.”To counteract all the pink, I decide we should play a game of football in the garden. Straight away, Romy asks if she can be a cheerleader while I play with Teddy. It’s hard to know if I should be telling her not to, or letting her go with her own ideas. Ultimately, she joins in and soon she’s getting so stuck in that, were this a proper game, she’d at least be on a yellow card.Football is an interesting area for me. Teddy has not yet shown much interest in it: he enjoys kicking a ball around, but when things get rough, with lots of kids fighting for the ball, he tends to back away. Part of me wants to respect this, but another part remembers the huge social capital you gain from being able to play a bit of football. Should I be pushing the issue?“Some of the social and interactive aspects of football can be very demoralising, almost to the point of being toxic,” says Cardew, who remembers the shock of seeing her own son being yelled at while he played football. “I know many stories of boys being verbally bullied by their teammates and the coaches turning a blind eye. But it doesn’t have to be like this.”Cardew points out that a football coach has a responsibility that goes beyond simply training pupils to become good footballers. “They are also role models to these boys and partly responsible for training their behaviour as a team. Good sportsmanship could be something they focus on: fair play, positive communication, team building, how to handle winning and losing, empowering each other, managing emotions. This would serve the boys on and off the football field.”Indeed, my main realisation after talking to Cardew and learning about the Hjalli model is how important it is that society changes as well as our parenting. In Iceland, a law was passed in 2021 that gave both new mothers and fathers six months of paid parental leave. Cardew says the results have been astonishing, with fathers stepping up their parenting game in remarkable ways. “It has opened their eyes to the beauty of being more involved with the rearing of a child,” she says. “But you fathers in the UK have to fight for it.”While the few weeks I spend following Hjalli principles certainly opens my mind to aspects of parenting, it feels like their methods are constantly butting up against bigger forces. I come away thinking that only if British society becomes as progressive as Iceland when it comes to gender parity could Hjalli’s fascinating ideas have the chance to really flourish here.The dos and don’ts of parenting, Icelandic styleDO …Treat both genders equally. If your son wants to paint his nails like his sister, then go for it.Play with blocks.Build things, invent games … a simple set of building blocks is better for a child’s imagination than a structured game.Be conscious of your language.You can reinforce stifling gender stereotypes without intending to.DON’T …Compliment your child’s looks.It enforces the idea that appearance is the most important aspect of their character.Rub out errors.Just cross them out with a line and continue. As Cardew says: “You can’t always erase mistakes, it’s best to face them and move on.”Punish your child.Your job as a parent is to help the child learn how best to react to difficult situations, rather than shame them.‘My favourite piece of advice that encapsulates traditional Polish parenting? Wear a hat!’Chitra Ramaswamytries the Polish methodView image in fullscreenChitra Ramaswamy with her daughter.Photograph: David Vintiner/The GuardianThe key to successful parenting, says Aga Rogala, is talking about emotions – and not just those of the child. “Polish parents tend to think if a child is happy, it means they’re good parents,” says the Polish parent therapist, podcaster and author of a book of parenting advice called Poukładaj to sobie w głowie (Sort it Out in Your Head). “And if they’re not happy, something’s wrong with their parenting.” Clearly this is ridiculous: a child is not a machine into which you input the correct data and get the same results each time. And yet. The truth is I commit this classic parental sin all the time.Take my 11-year-old autistic son. When he’s settled, happy, and his needs are being met, I am settled, happy (and obviously none of my needs are being met). When he is anxious, stressed, or, in his own unique turn of phrase, “not having a nice feeling”, I, too, am very much not having a nice feeling. Time and time again I tell myself: do not predicate your happiness on the happiness of your child. That way lies … turbulence. But I can’t help myself. I want him to be happy. I’m his mum.Rogala reckons the most meaningful thing I can do, as the mother of my son and seven-year-old neurotypical daughter, is “really feel the weight of it all … examine how you’re coping with the burden of questions like, ‘Am I doing this right? Have I taken care of everything? Do they have healthy relationships?’” A series of questions that hits like a line of strategically placed Lego bricks beneath my tired bare feet. Yikes! Now I’m really not having a nice feeling.“Parents try to keep all their ‘bad emotions’ inside them, not talk about them, not even make some safe space to express them with their partner,” continues Rogala, who runs workshops with parents across Poland. “It’s always like you’re trying to repress it in yourself. So many mothers cry to me, ‘Oh, I’m screaming at my child, I feel terrible. I’m a terrible mother.’”The style of parenting she sees most in her work is an amped-up helicopter/tiger hybrid that will be all too familiar to middle-class parents in many countries. “It’s like we don’t try to have a perfect child any more. We try to be perfect parents. We think we have to be everywhere in our children’s lives. We can’t let them solve any problems on their own. We put huge pressure on them to get good grades.” It sounds so stressful. “This is why Polish parents are some of the most burnt-out in Europe,” she agrees. “The Polish parenting style is exhausting.”Rogala, who was born in 1982, thinks the prevalence of this method is a reaction to the way her generation was parented under communism. Or rather, not parented. “My early childhood took place in the last period of communism and the first years of the new era. It was very, very difficult for our parents. They had to struggle with many problems, the economy crashing and mass unemployment, and were mostly absent. We are the generation who grew up with keys around our necks because our parents were always working or queueing, never at home to let us in after school. Many of us were quite alone as children. Our parents were exhausted. Many had no idea how to talk to us about feelings. When you have to survive, there’s no room for such things. So now, they have decided to be very present. It’s not the answer to the problems of parenting. The reality is there is no answer.” Which is probably the greatest, most border-crossing piece of parenting advice of all.How would she describe her own parenting style? “The Polish name for it iskocham i wymagam’, which means ‘I love and I set boundaries’,” Rogala says. Her children are 16, 14, and eight, and house rules include eating dinner as a family with no phones or TV. Her two eldest children have phones which activate at 7am and shut down at 9pm; they’re not allowed TikTok and her 14-year-old daughter doesn’t, by choice, use social media. Saturdays are cleaning days with everyone involved. Rogala doesn’t supervise homework and the older kids go to their rooms around 10pm but go to bed when they want. She reads her youngest a book at bedtime and strokes his back as he falls asleep.Some of this, like following established routines at mealtimes and bedtimes, is similar to what goes down in my home in Edinburgh. Much of it is not. Rogala says family meals at the dinner table, particularly on Sundays with grandparents, are enshrined in Polish culture. In our house, my son’s autism means he has to eat alone at the table so my partner Claire, our daughter and I often eat in the sitting room in front of the telly. Which brings me to the fundamental issue I’ve had with parenting advice since my son got his diagnosis aged four. It never seems to apply to those of us raising autistic children. Or children with any additional needs. Or, for that matter, queer parents. In Poland, the adoption of children by same-sex couples has been banned, and, unsurprisingly, Rogala has never worked with LGBTQI+ parents in her workshops.My son has pretty much unlimited access to his screen, which is hard for his sister, who is allowed an hour a day, supervised, on her tablet. But he needs it to regulate, communicate and feed his brain’s insatiable appetite for whatever his special interests happen to be. This time last year, that was Lewis Capaldi singing Forever. Now it’s train announcements on the line between Edinburgh and Glenrothes with Thornton, and Paddington Bear drinking mouthwash. I often think we’re the ones who should be doing the advising, because parents of autistic children have been ruthlessly trained in the sacred parental arts of patience, empathy, humour and creative problem-solving. We’re constantly rewriting the manual, rolling with the punches (often literally), and trying to solve the latest ultra-niche problem.As for pieces of advice that encapsulate traditional Polish parenting, my favourite has to be … wear a hat. I do live in Scotland, after all. Apparently this is a command addressed to children of any age, at any time of year, by Polish grandparents down the ages. What else? “Tell your children not to run or break a sweat.” Rogala says there’s a fear, again passed on from grandparents, that strenuous activity makes children sick. This one pleases my daughter immensely, what with her being a homebody who embraces pyjama days the way my son does level crossings. “Oh, and we are very much afraid of … what is the word? When you open the window …” Erm, fresh air? “No, a blast of wind! It will make them ill!” The solution, we agree, once again lies in wearing a hat.Fundamentally, Rogala believes parenting is not about swinging on a pendulum between extremes. “In Poland it’s either, ‘I’m doing great, I’m a good parent’ or, ‘I do everything wrong, I’m a terrible parent’ and there’s nothing in between. To me, the solutions are all in the in between.”The dos and don’ts of parenting, Polish styleDO …Make space at the weekend, especially on a Sunday, for a big family meal.Invite as many generations as possible, especially grandparents. Serve soup, always, plus meat with potatoes, and say to your children, “You don’t have to eat the potatoes, just eat your meat!”Help your children with their homework.Although good grades are encouraged, making an effort at school is the most important thing.Wear a hat!A directive for children, not parents.DON’T …Encourage laziness in your child.They should respect the value of hard work.Leavechildren to set their own boundaries.Including bedtime routines and with screen time.Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingFamilyChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s kind of lost its appeal because everything is not a pound.”Samantha, a shopper outside Poundland’s Luton retail park outlet who is heading off to B&M to find some better deals, sums up the feelings of many of her fellow bargain hunters and a central problem facing the new owner of the budget retailer.Gordon Brothers, which snapped up Poundlandfor a pound earlier this month– appears to have got a cheaper deal than is now available on many of the shelves at the chain, where there is a dizzying array of prices – from £14 jackets to £3 boxes of lightbulbs and £1.50 lipgloss.The group, which dived to a pre-tax loss of more than £51m last year despite sales at its outlets in the UK, Republic of Ireland and Isle of Man rising slightly to £1.82bn, according to accounts filed at Companies House, is aiming toclose up to 150 of its 800 UK storesand asking landlords to cut rents on many more as it battles for survival.On a busy lunchtime in Luton, shoppers are queueing up for Poundland’s largely self-service tills but many are convinced they can find better bargains elsewhere.This area highlights how the competition is breathing down Poundland’s neck. The retail park store is just a couple of doors down from B&M, a major competitor, while its nearby outlet in the centre of Luton is squeezed between one of the UK’s few remaining Wilkos and The Works – both cut-price rivals.View image in fullscreen‘Everything in there is not a pound’: Floretta Pope and her daughter Tia. She says she no longer shops frequently at Poundland as items can be smaller than normal.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianFloretta Pope, 68, who is passing by with her daughter Tia, 32, says she no longer shops very frequently in Poundland. “Everything in there is not a pound and, even if it is, it can be smaller than normal. It is not really an attractive place to shop.”“I always find it a bit hectic in Poundland,” adds Katie Duffy, 26. “I don’t tend to go in. B&M has more choice.”Bargain chains are having a particularly tough time due to rising competition from supermarkets, including Tesco, Aldi and Lidl.The expansion of groups such as Savers, The Range, B&M, The Works and Home Bargains as well as online rivals such as Temu and Shein mean the budget market is now very crowded even since thedemise of major player Wilko in 2023, which was left with only a few stores after The Range snapped up the brand.There has already been some consolidation. Poundland’s rival Poundstretcher wasbought last year by Majestic Wine’s owner, Fortress,in its latest rescue deal, while another rival, Poundworld,closed its 350 stores in 2018and Poundland bought its rival99p Storesin 2015.Despite that, Poundland has been losing ground. Industry research group GlobalData estimates that its market share has fallen 2.3 percentage points (ppts) between 2019 and 2024 while Home Bargains, B&M and The Range’s shares increased by 7.2ppts, 6.2ppts and 1.3ppts respectively.It is a dramatic turnaround in the past decade when Poundland grew rapidly amid demand for cheap stores.View image in fullscreenKatie Duffy now tends to shop at rival discounter B&M, which she says has more choice for shoppers. Poundland is aiming to close up to 150 of its 800 UK stores.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianIt rode a wave on which the UK’s pound shop estatedoubledbetween 2010 and 2016, according to the retail analyst Local Data Company now known as Green Street. The number continued to climb between 2015 and 2024 when more than 480 were added.Growth has now stalled according to Green Street and21 shops in the pound-store category haveclosed this year.Poundland’s parent group, Pepco, said it put the group up for sale after the government’s increase in national insurance and business rates in April, which it said would “add further pressure to Poundland’s cost base”. But it also admitted it had made mistakes, including putting its Pepco clothing ranges into stores – which had not gone down well with UK shoppers.The budget retailers are under particular pressure from a raft of increases in basic business costs – such as wages, energy and property tax – as their slim profit margins give them little room to absorb additional costs.Meanwhile, the low-wage shoppers that make up the core of their fanbase now have little spare cash for non-essentials and those with more to spare can get what they need with their supermarket shop, where they are increasingly locked in by loyalty-card-linked discounts.The general slowdown in visits to physical stores on high streets and shopping malls has also hit bargain chains whose rock-bottom prices are designed to tempt passersby into impulse purchases.One former Poundland director, said the brand had “lost its way” by becoming “far too complicated and confusing for customers” with such an array of different price points. He said its decision in 2019to drop the focus on £1 itemsalso meant business operations, including running stores and dealing with suppliers had become more costly and complex.View image in fullscreen‘Lost its way’: a retail analyst says the introduction of multiple price points has confused customers. The retailer dropped its focus on £1 items in 2019.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianPoundland itselfsaid in Januaryit wanted to increase the number of items on sale for a £1 or less from 1,500, less than a third of its core range of 5,000 items, to almost half – 2,400. However, a banner outside the Luton store still only boasted of having the lower number of products at or below the headline price point.Emily Scott, a retail analyst at GlobalData agrees: “The introduction of multiple price points has confused customers, while still not enabling shoppers to trade up within its ranges as it lacks the additional choice of mid to premium products.”She adds: “Poundland’s weak variety of branded goods at low prices has meant it has struggled to keep pace, damaging its brand perception amongst brand- and budget-conscious shoppers.”Poundland said: “Despite continuing to serve 20 million shoppers a year, we know we’ve not met customers’ expectations in a number of areas over the last couple of years.“We’ve heard them and we’re looking forward to having the opportunity to put those missteps right as we put our recovery plan in place.”The former director believes Poundland could still have a place on high streets but might need to shift to something more akin to the US chain Five Below, which sells items for five dollars or less to give more flexibility as costs rise. But, he warns, “they have to keep it simple”.Explore more on these topicsPoundlandRetail industryUK cost of living crisisConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

First, he contacted a minister he knew, asking for an introduction to the minister who was best placed to make the decision. Second, he sent an email pressing a civil servant to set up a meeting. “My intervention is to elevate the discussion to ministerial level,” he wrote.Less than two weeks later, Dannatt and an executive behind the bid met Lee Rowley, the relevant business minister, to push for government backing.At issue is whether Dannatt broke the House of Lords rules that bar peers from lobbying ministers and officials in return for payment or financial incentive.Dannatt said he was not paid for engaging with the government. He said he helped a friend, a leading businessperson in the consortium, attempt to buy the factory as he believed it would save jobs and help the country. “Put simply, I was helping a friend achieve an outcome very much in the national interest,” he said.Dannatt later received four payments during the period he was chairing the venture. He described these as “honorarium” payments, but would not say how much he received.He was also the public face and “chairman” of the “embryonic” venture.Dannatt said his name and position added credibility to the discussions with the US company. “I am not sure how else a retired four-star general who sits in the House of Lords could be described to the Americans,” he said, but he had agreed to take the title despite there being “no board to chair, no meetings to attend or other business to conduct”.His involvement with the consortium, which was ultimately unsuccessful in its bid, ended in February 2023.Dannatt hasbeen under investigation by the House of Lords authoritiessince March after the Guardian revealed he had offered to secure meetings with ministers for undercover reporters pretending to be commercial clients wanting to lobby the government.He had been secretly filmedtelling the undercover reportershe could make introductions within the government and that he would “make a point of getting to know” the best-placed minister.He is being investigated by the House of Lords commissioner for standards, the watchdog who scrutinises claims of wrongdoing in the upper chamber.Dannatt, 74, has previously denied the allegations, saying: “I am well aware of … the Lords code of conduct … I have always acted on my personal honour.”He is one of five peers toface conduct inquiries after a months-long investigationby the Guardian.The Lords debate project examined the commercial interests of members of the House of Lords amid concerns their activities were not being properly regulated. It revealed that 91 peers had been paidby commercial companies to give political or policy advice.The new documents regarding Dannatt’s communications with the government in June2022 were disclosed under freedom of information legislation.At the time Dannatt was fronting a group of investors who wanted to buy a fertiliser factory in Cheshire. CF Industries, the US owners, planned to permanently close the factory after energy prices made it unprofitable.The consortium of investors argued that their proposal would save 500 jobs and keep important products used in the agriculture and hospitality industries within the UK.On 10 June 2022, Dannatt emailed a junior business minister he knew, asking if he could tell him who was the minister with responsibility for this area. “If you could point me in the right direction, ideally with an introduction, and I can take it from there.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionHe promoted his UK-based consortium as a better “economic and political alternative” to the closure of the factory.Five key takeaways from the Guardian’s House of Lords seriesRead more“The alternative scenario is that a hedge fund buys the factory, sells off its assets and exits with a profit, allowing 500 workers to become redundant, the UK dependent on imported CO2and no increase in fertiliser production thus the price remaining high.”An introduction to the right minister was made. Six days later, the peer emailed a senior official in the business department, saying: “I am aware that [Dannatt’s friend] has been talking with officials but my intervention is to elevate the discussion to ministerial level. There are some quite key issues at stake here relating to jobs in the north-west and the price of some key commodities.”On 27 June, Dannatt and Mark Law, his friend who was also leading the consortium, met Rowley, then a minister in the business department.The Financial Times has previouslyreported that the consortium sought a government loan of up to £10m to help restart the factory.The government refused, arguing that it was purely a commercial matter. The consortium later collapsed.Dannatt said he had not had any formal arrangements or contract with the consortium, nor had he discussed with Law what his future role might have been if they had managed to buy the factory. “My motivation and purpose was to get a deal over the line, in the national interest,” he said.He said any assumption that he “would have developed a substantive and remunerated role as chairman and taken an active role in the work of the company” was wrong. He added that if the bid had been successful, “it would have been a very different matter”.As well as the continuing investigation by the House of Lords authorities, another watchdog has examined Dannatt’s conduct. Last month, it cleared Dannatt of being paid by the consortium to lobby the government.Harry Rich, the registrar of consultant lobbyists, is responsible for investigating whether individuals have broken the law by failing to declare that they have received money from a third party to lobby ministers or Whitehall’s most senior officials.However the House of Lords watchdog is considering the matter under a different set of rules which take a wider view of lobbying than the registrar of consultant lobbyists.The question now is whether, as the consortium’s chair, he advocated for the venture on the understanding that he could at some point benefit personally. This could be a breach of the Lords rules.Dannatt has passed his correspondence with the Guardian about his involvement with the consortium to the House of Lords commissioner who is investigating his conduct when speaking to undercover reporters.Do you have information about this story?

We’ve been stuck on this hot and humid train for over an hour.”A Thameslink spokesperson replied: “This train will be getting evacuated shortly. Please wait until response staff have boarded and set up a safe evacuation route.”Govia Thameslink Railway andNetwork Railhave apologised for the delays.A Thameslink spokesperson said: “Earlier today, a fault on a train near Loughborough Junction brought all services to a halt in the area, three of them outside station platforms.“Without power and air conditioning on such a hot day, we pulled all resources from across Sussex and Kent to get personnel on site to safely evacuate passengers as quickly as possible along the track.“This would have been a difficult and uncomfortable experience for our passengers and we are truly sorry.”The Met Office said there was a provisional temperature of more than 33C recorded in Surrey, making Saturday the hottest day of the year so far.A yellow warning for thunderstorms covering parts of south-east Scotland, Yorkshire, the Midlands and Wales has been issued for Saturday evening until 3am on Sunday.Up to 40mm of rain could fall in less than two hours, the Met Office said, as it urged those in the warning areas to consider whether their location was at risk of flash flooding and to prepare accordingly.An amber heat-health alert, issued by the UK Health Security Agency for the first time since September 2023, for all regions in England remains in place over the weekend.Explore more on these topicsRail transportUK weatherLondonNetwork RailTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

One Kneecap band member is currently on bail, charged under the Terrorism Act.“As a publicly funded platform, the BBC should not be rewarding extremism.”Badenoch previously called for the group to be banned from Glastonbury. Last year Kneecap won a discrimination case against the UK government in Belfast high court after Badenoch tried to refuse them a £14,250 funding award when she was a minister in the previous government.A BBC spokesperson said: “As the broadcast partner, the BBC will be bringing audiences extensive music coverage from Glastonbury, with artists booked by the festival organisers.“Whilst the BBC doesn’t ban artists, our plans will ensure that our programming will meet our editorial guidelines. Decisions about our output will be made in the lead-up to the festival.”On Wednesday, Ó hAnnaidh, who performs under the stage name Mo Chara, was cheered by hundreds of supporters as he arrived with bandmates Naoise O Cairealláin and JJ Ó Dochartaigh at Westminster magistrates court in “Free Mo Chara” T-shirts.Ó hAnnaidh was released on unconditional bail until his next hearing on 20 August.After the hearing, the rapper said: “For anybody going to Glastonbury, you can see us there at 4pm on the Saturday.“If you can’t be there we’ll be on the BBC, if anybody watches the BBC. We’ll be at Wembley in September.“But most importantly: free, free Palestine.”The charge followed a counter-terrorism police investigation after gig footage came to light, which also allegedly showed the group calling for the deaths of MPs. In April, Kneecap apologised to the families of murdered MPs but said footage of the incident had been “exploited and weaponised”.Explore more on these topicsKneecapKeir StarmerGlastonbury 2025newsShareReuse this content"

The timing now is deliberate – a policy-heavy counteroffensive in theso-called red wall, where Reform UK has surged in recent polling.The skills package responds to a stark reality: one in seven young people are not in education or employment, and the number of apprenticeships has fallen by nearly 20% since 2016.The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, called the strategy an “economic and social reset”. “Skills rightly run right through the heart of this industrial strategy because they are key to breaking the link between background and success for young people,” she said.The strategy builds on previous announcements, including a £187m package for AI training announced during London Tech Week and a £3bn apprenticeship fund to create 120,000 places in healthcare, carpentry and construction.But the scale of new funding is modest – about £275m spread over four years, including roughly £200m for infrastructure and course delivery – and Labour may face pressure from industry and unions to go further in reforming the apprenticeship levy, immigration skills charge and energy costs for heavy industry.Explore more on these topicsIndustrial policyLabourManufacturing sectorApprenticeshipsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Arkansas also has a similar law that has been challenged in federal court.The Texas measure easily passed in the Republican-controlled state House and Senate in the legislative session that ended on 2 June.“The focus of this bill is to look at what is historically important to our nation educationally and judicially,” Republican state representative Candy Noble, a co-sponsor of the bill, said when it passed the House.The Ten Commandments laws are among efforts, mainly in conservative-led states, to insert religion into public schools. Texas lawmakers also passed a bill that lets school districts provide students and staff a daily voluntary period of prayer or time to read a religious text during school hours.Texas’ law requires public schools to post in classrooms a 16 x 20in (41 x 51cm) poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments, even though translations and interpretations vary across denominations, faiths and languages and may differ in homes and houses of worship.Supporters say the Ten Commandments are part of the foundation of the United States’ judicial and educational systems and should be displayed.Opponents, including some Christian and other faith leaders, say the Ten Commandments and prayer measures infringe on others’ religious freedom.A letter signed this year by dozens of Christian and Jewish faith leaders opposing the bill noted that Texas has thousands of students of other faiths who might have no connection to the Ten Commandments. Texas has nearly 6 million students in about 9,100 public schools.In 2005, Abbott, who was state attorney general at the time, successfully argued before the supreme court that Texas could keep a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of its capitol.Louisiana’s law has twice been ruled unconstitutional by federal courts, first by US district judge John deGravelles and then again by a three-judge panel of the fifth US circuit court of appeals, which also considers cases from Texas.State attorney general Liz Murrell said she would appeal and pledged to take it to the US supreme court if necessary.Explore more on these topicsTexasUS politicsRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

The hosts were still some way from flipping the advantage they had handed India but by stumps, after an earlier fightback with the ball, Ollie Pope’s unbeaten 100 had established something akin to a foothold in the contest.Pope came into this Test with questions being asked about his spot at No 3; questions that centred around a poor record against India and Australia and not quelled bythat 171 against Zimbabwe. Jacob Bethell, flavour of the month in New Zealand late last year, was breathing down his neck, even if potential, rather than back catalogue, was the driver.Jasprit Bumrah turns the series into two – when he’s bowling and when he’s not | Andy BullRead moreAnd yet as England closed on 209 for three in reply to India’s 471 all out – a total derailed by a collapse of seven for 41 – Stokes was grateful to his vice-captain for holding firm in the face of a typically electric display by Jasprit Bumrah. It would be wrong to roll out Graham Gooch’s old line about Richard Hadlee – “World XI at one end, Ilford 2nds at the other” – but when Bumrah was on, the smell of wickets hung in the clammy air.View image in fullscreenIndia’s Yashasvi Jaiswal drops Ollie Pope on 60. off the bowling of Jasprit Bumrah.Photograph: Allan McKenzie/SWpix.com/ShutterstockIndia’s remarkable slingshot could easily have had more than his three for 48 from 13 overs, not least the edge that Yashasvi Jaiswal had earlier grassed at slip when Pope was on 60. His day underlined where the crux of this series likely sits but ended with those broad shoulders slumped. Harry Brook, on nought simply tasked with seeing out the final over, was caught playing a wild hook, only for a front-foot no-ball to be called.The Yorkshire faithful could have been forgiven for grumbling about there being “more brains in a pork pie” – a charge that at least could not be laid at Pope. His one life aside, England’s No 3 had been largely equal to his unique challenge of Bumrah and the spikiness of Mohammed Siraj. Emerging after the loss of Zak Crawley sixth ball, and looking in touch from the outset, Pope sent 13 fours cruising along this fast outfield.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Josh Tongue took four wickets for eight runs in 17 balls.Photograph: John Mallett/ProSports/ShutterstockPope looked a bit like a local at times, picking up runs behind square as they tend to do in these parts and sealing his ninth Test century before the close. The celebration was one of pent up frustration being released. But he also needed partners, Ben Duckett making a typically punchy 62 in a stand of 122 runs and Joe Root adding 28 in an alliance worth of 80. Both had early reprieves – Duckett dropped on 15, Root overturning an lbw on seven – and both were ultimately Bumrah’d in the end.It was never going to be straightforward, with India’s collapse either side of lunch as welcome for England as it was potentially ominous. The clouds had rolled over Headingley to start the Dukes ball hooping and only made way in the evening. For Josh Tongue this was simply manna from heaven, day one figures of none for 75 from 16 transformed into four for 86 from 20 courtesy of a rapid demolition of the tail. As Stokes joked in his celebrations, Tongue was devouring some rabbit pie here.View image in fullscreenIndia’s Rishabh Pant celebrates his century in acrobatic style. His wildly entertaining 134 from 178 balls included 12 fours and six sixes.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAAlthough the spark was Shoaib Bashir getting the breakthrough that his performance 24 hours earlier had deserved when Shubman Gill looked to take down the off-spinner on 147 and skewed the ball to deep backward square. Gill and Pant had put on 209 for the fourth wicket, the latter turning his overnight 65 into three figures and celebrating with a superb somersault. Going by the ovation, the locals thought was flippin’ marvellous.Pant sure is an entertainer, his eventual 134 from 178 balls packed with more fun than a day at Disney. And yet for all the tumbling scoops and range hitting into the Western Terrace – 12 fours and six sixes – it was stitched together with watchful defence. This, as much as the mischief, is why only three wicketkeepers – Adam Gilchrist (17), Andy Flower (12) and Les Ames (8) – have scored more than his seven Test centuries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among the three ducks that made it so was poor Karun Nair, who had spent eight years waiting for a Test recall and chipped his fourth delivery from Stokes to a flying Pope at short cover. It really can be a cruel sport at times.Our graphic is for a right-hander, to keep all the wagon wheels consistent, so 88 of his 134 runs came on the leg sideOur graphic is for a right-hander, to keep all the wagon wheels consistent, so 88 of his 134 runs came on the leg side.Tongue knows it all too well, of course, the fast bowler back this summer after an 18-month battle with injuries. Reward for this perseverance came with the eventual removal of Pant, a switch to around the wicket messing up the left-hander’s calibrations and leading to an odd-looking lbw offering no shot. Jamie Smith, who had earlier missed a stumping off Pant when he was on 124, could also breathe a sigh of relief.This was possibly surpassed by those from Duckett and Crawley after Tongue gobbled up his rabbit pie and 40 minutes of rain then intervened. Not that conditions improved much after the restart, Bumrah steaming in under lights, squaring up Crawley in his first over, and seeing an edge fly into the cordon. But on this sticky second day Indian hands lost some of their adhesiveness and Pope wriggled England free.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025India cricket teamEngland cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Ever.”The academy also rejected the Active Club’s extremist ideology, emphasizing: “We accept and welcome all people. We all belong. No matter background, skin color, creed, nationality, or status.”As for how the group gained entry, the school said it provides keypad access to members so they can train outside regular class hours.

He says the results cost him his job: ‘We found too many slaves’When the extent of the university’s involvement with slavery was unearthed, a scholar tracking descendants of enslaved workers was suddenly firedMichela MoscufoSat 21 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 21 Jun 2025 17.46 EDTShareJordan Lloyd had been praying for something big to happen. The 35-year-old screenwriter was quarantining in her apartment in North Hollywood in June 2020. Without any work projects to fill her days, she picked up the novel Roots, by Alex Haley, to reread.The novel tells the story of Kunta Kinte, Haley’s ancestor, who is captured and sold intoslaveryin the Gambia and then brought toVirginia, where he is forced to labor on a plantation. It was adapted into an Emmy-award winning television series in the 1970s, and while reading it again, Lloyd thought to herself, “Wouldn’t it be nice if they could make another Roots?”A few days later, out of the blue, she received an email from an undergraduate student atHarvard Universityin Cambridge, Massachusetts. The email was short. The woman introduced herself as Carissa Chen, a junior at the college studying history. She was working on an independent research project to find descendants of enslaved people connected to the university. By using historical records and modern genealogy tools, she had found Lloyd.Harriet Tubman’s church in Canada was a crucial force in the abolitionist movement. It’s still standing todayRead more“I have reason to believe through archival research that you could be the descendant of Tony and Cuba Vassall, two slaves taken from Antigua by a founding member connected toHarvard University,” the email read. “Are you available anytime for a call?”The note linked to a website containing a family tree that Chen had created, tracing the lineage of people enslaved by Isaac Royall Jr, an Antiguan planter and businessman whose endowment would eventually create Harvard Law School.Chen hadn’t expected to find any living descendants, she told the Guardian, but through dogged research, she managed to uncover 50 names and found Lloyd through an old website she had made when she had first moved to Los Angeles.“It all felt too specific to be a scam,” Lloyd recounted, so she agreed to a call that would eventually blow open everything she thought she knew about her family history, linking her with one of the nation’s most prestigious institutions and launching a phase in her life that would be colored with equal parts joy and pain.US universities and the legacy of slaveryThough it contradicts a common perception of colonial New England, enslaved people were brought to work in northern cities in North America as well. In her book New England Bound, the historian Wendy Warren records the remarks of one European traveler who noted in 1687 that “there is not a house in Boston, however small may be its means, that has not one or two [enslaved people]”.As the country’s oldest and wealthiest university, Harvard’s history is inextricable from the history of transatlantic slavery. The enslaved labored in campus buildings, university presidents and professors owned people forced into bondage, and the school’s wealth grew through a circle of donors intimately connected to the plantation system in the Caribbean, the American south and the trafficking of enslaved Africans across the Atlantic.Harvard began, informally, to research its relationship to slavery as early as 2007, when the history professor Sven Beckert started leading undergraduate research seminars such as the one Chen took. In 2016, then Harvard president Drew Faust acknowledged the university was “directly complicit” in slavery and, in 2022, the university released an official report,Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery, which detailed its history over more than a hundred pages.View image in fullscreenPhotographs of enslaved people in the US, possibly the oldest known in the country, were discovered in the basement of a Harvard University museum in 1977.Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveHarvard is not the only academic institution with this burden. Currentlymore than 100 universitiesacross the world are investigating their ties to slavery, the vast majority of which are in the US. A small subset of the universities researching their ties to slavery – approximately five – have committed to conducting genealogical research and identifying living descendants. Religious denominations such as the Episcopal church and the Evangelical Lutheran church and more than a dozen cities and four states have also begun researching their legacies of slavery. The California state reparations taskforce published a 1,000-page report two years ago, and state legislators have been developing – and passing – reparations-related initiatives.The Guardian, founded in 1821 in Manchester, England, began its own process in 2020, when its sole owner,the Scott Trust, commissioned independent academic researchers to uncover its links to transatlantic slavery. It revealed that the newspaper’s founder, John Edward Taylor, and nine out of 11 of his financial backers had direct ties, mainly through Manchester’scotton industry. In 2023, the Scott Trustapologizedfor its role in transatlantic slavery and committed to a 10-year restorative justice program, with millions earmarked for descendant communities. That year, the Guardian also launched an ongoing series calledCotton Capital, which explores the legacies of slavery globally.The2022 Harvard reportincluded a list of recommendations by the presidential committee: develop educational partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities, create a public memorial, and – perhaps most contentiously – identify living descendants of people enslaved by university staff, leaders and faculty. The announcement was accompanied by a $100m endowment for “implementation”.The person the university tapped to lead the descendant research is a man named Richard Cellini, who has a kind of mythological status in the world of institutional accountability and slavery research. By his own admission, his skill lies primarily in selecting talented researchers, and “keeping them happy”. The university, it seemed, was fully committed to beginning a process of discovery and atonement, putting resources and brainpower behind a project that could set the tone for institutions around the country, and the world. If successful, Harvard could demonstrate that truth-telling and reconciliation are possible on a large scale, that an institutional culture around silence and historical revisionism can be overturned, and that light can shine into even the deepest cracks. But that would ultimately not be the case. Not yet, at least.‘A source of guilt and shame for Harvard’When I visited Cellini in the archives of the Harvard Business School in mid-February, he was bent over a 19th-century ledger book, trained on a set of records with a magnifying glass. He is a trained attorney and tech entrepreneur, and though jovial and quick to joke, he becomes stoic when speaking about his research.In 2015, he started an independent project at Georgetown University in Washington DC to locate the descendants of 272 enslaved people sold by Jesuit leaders in the mid-1800s to raise money for the university. Cellini said he was driven by a sense of moral outrage upon learning about the sale, as well as a curiosity to see what he could find. Along with 10 other researchers, they would eventually locate more than 10,000 direct descendants. Cellini’s effort, called the Georgetown Memory Project, remains independent although the university has given preferential consideration during the admissions process to descendants and created a “reconciliation fund’ for their benefit.In the winter of 2022, before the Harvard report was made public, Cellini said he was approached by the former president of the school, Larry Bacow, and a dean, Tomiko Brown-Nagin, who asked him if he could do the same thing for Harvard.When he started the research, Harvard had already identified the names of 70 people that had been enslaved with ties to the university. Over the course of the past three years, working alongside American Ancestors, the country’s pre-eminent genealogical institute, Cellini and his researchershave identified morethan 900 people that had been enslaved by university affiliates (faculty, staff and people in leadership positions) and nearly 500 of their direct living descendants.It wasn’t long after the work began to pick up steam that Cellini started running into trouble.In March 2023, he said he was asked to meet with the project’s executive director, Roeshana Moore-Evans, and the Harvard staff member overseeing the initiative, the public health professor and vice-provost for special projects, Sara Bleich.These informal meetings were held in a boardroom in the student center, a tall glass building overlooking the gates of Harvard Yard. It was here and during extended phone calls that Cellini claims he was told repeatedly by Bleich “not to find too many descendants”.“At one point the fear was expressed that if we found too many descendants, it would bankrupt the university,” he said.View image in fullscreenRoberta Wolff, a descendant of Tony, Cuba and Darby Vassall – people enslaved by Harvard benefactors in the institution’s first decades – on the front porch of her family home in 2022 in Bellingham, Massachusetts.Photograph: Charles Krupa/APCellini told Bleich that was “ludicrous”, he said. Was he supposed to falsify the evidence, to destroy it, to ignore it? “I asked for guidance, and the answer was that she didn’t know,” he said, “but we shouldn’t report too many descendants.”Bleich denies this. “The university never issued a directive to him to limit the number of direct descendants that could be identified through the work,” she told the Guardian during a phone interview. Moore-Evans declined to comment on the meetings.In the process of trying to get additional funding for the project, arguing that the amount of work had increased tenfold because of all the additional names that were being uncovered, Cellini met with the finance director for the president’s office, Patricia Harrington, this past fall.Harrington wouldn’t give him a clear answer about his funding request, telling him, “Unfortunately you keep finding more slaves,” he said, and that “every new person is a source of guilt and shame for Harvard”. A spokesperson for the university said: “Any assertion that Patricia Harrington disparaged the work of the Legacy ofSlaveryInitiative, including descendant research, is false.” Even though Cellini was eventually given a budget for 2025, albeit a fraction of what he had asked for, the university would soon halt his work entirely.A family’s rich history tied to the founding of the USThe early days of discoverywere a golden time for Lloyd and her immediate family. Together with Lloyd’s father, Dennis, and Chen, they would meet over Zoom and swap stories. Her dad was sharing parts of family history that Lloyd had never heard before: about his soft-spoken mother and his dad, who owned a flower shop in a neighborhood of Boston called Charlestown.“People will open up to a stranger in a way that’s more honest and unfiltered, wanting to be thorough in a way that you would never with your family,” Lloyd said. Chen, in turn, detailed the findings of her research to the Lloyds and they began to fill in their histories, tracing connections to the colonial period and height of the “triangular trade”.Lloyd’s ancestor seven generations back, Cuba Vassall, was three years old when she was forcibly moved from Antigua to a suburb of Boston along with her family by Isaac Royall Jr, in 1737. The Royalls were the largest slave-owning family in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, owning nearly 70 enslaved people who labored on a 500-acre plantation just north of Boston, as well as controlling more than 100 people on their plantation in Antigua.Before long, Lloyd’s ancestors were transferred to another wealthy Cambridge family, the Vassalls, for whom they labored in an elaborate Georgian mansion currently known as the Longfellow House, near the campus of the then growing Harvard University.The Vassalls owned plantations in Jamaica where more than a thousand people were enslaved. John Vassall was a Harvard graduate, along with his brother Lewis, who once paid for a portion of his tuition with a large barrel of sugar, one of the most lucrative commodities produced by enslaved people. Cuba’s original enslaver, Isaac Royall Jr, didn’t have any direct ties to Harvard while he was living, but he endowed a professorship in his will, likely to ensure his legacy would live on as a member of the colonial elite. The seal of Harvard Law School was the Royall family crest until 2016, when students protested to demand its replacement. The Royall professorship was retired in 2022.At the Longfellow House, Cuba met and married a man named Tony, originally from Jamaica, who was also enslaved by the Vassalls. They had six children, including Lloyd’s ancestor Darby. During the American revolutionary war, the royalist Vassalls fled and the house was occupied by George Washington, who used it as his headquarters during the siege of Boston. According to one anecdote, Washington asked then six-year-old Darby to work for him, who replied he wouldn’t work without wages.After the war, Tony and Cuba petitioned the state to stay in a small dwelling on the property, where they cultivated a piece of land for farming. They had both spent 60 years of their life in slavery, Tony wrote in the 1781 letter, and “though deprived of what makes them now happy beyond expression yet they have ever lived a life of honesty and have been faithful in their master’s service”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toCotton CapitalFree weekly newsletterA behind the scenes look at the Cotton Capital project, direct to your inbox for 15 weeksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was an activist throughout his life, supporting the abolitionist movement, becoming a founding member of the African Society of Boston and adding his name to a state petition to protect Black people against the Fugitive Slave Act, along with his daughter and son-in-law.At the end of his life, Darby chose to be buried in the Vassall family tomb underneath Christ Church in Cambridge, which Lloyd and her family went to visit last June. The tomb is in the basement, in a low-ceilinged crypt locked behind heavy black metal doors, and a couple inches of a curved brick structure, peeking above the granite dust floor, is the only indication. A dried flower arrangement that Lloyd left is still there, a tidy pile of lavender, white chrysanthemum and clover.Making these connections and being able to visit her ancestor’s grave brought Lloyd a deep sense of “internal certainty and peace and comfort and groundedness”, she said. “I would want that for everyone whose family is somehow affiliated.” Yet the joy and excitement comes with a “deep sadness”.“Why hasn’t this been resolved?” she wondered aloud during an interview phone call. “Why did no one in my family know?”Lloyd’s only contact from the administration, she said, was an “icy” interaction with Brown-Nagin during a group call, and she has heard nothing since. “Naively, I was expecting them to be very welcoming and excited to facilitate discussion,” she said. “I was hoping they would be warmer, more open to reconcile the long history.” The university says it has not begun the outreach process.Since the initiative was announced, the university has given out more than $4m in grants to local organizations and built out partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities, such as theDu Bois Scholars Program.“This is by far the hardest job that I’ve had,” Bleich, who oversees the Harvard Legacy of Slavery initiative, said. “We are very serious about this, and we are very sincere.”Firings, resignations and attempts to ‘dilute and delay’ researchIn late January, as he was pulling his car into the parking lot of Harvard Business School, prepared to begin another day of research in the university archives, Cellini received a call from an HR person who said he and his team were fired, effective immediately.He was never given an explanation, he said, and a university spokesperson told the Guardian “we cannot comment on personnel matters”. The genealogy research, the university announced after Cellini’s firing, would be continued through an “expanded partnership” with American Ancestors, the genealogy non-profit that had already been working closely with Cellini’s team.“They’re the world’s best genealogists,” Cellini said. Based on his team’s research in the Harvard archives identifying school leaders, faculty or staff who owned enslaved people and the names of the people they enslaved, American Ancestors would then search “downstream”, as Cellini put it, for living descendants. In this new agreement, the organization has taken over all aspects of the research.The initiative received its first public blow last spring, when two university professors on the committee to create a memorial stepped down, saying in an open letter the university had attempted to “dilute and delay” their efforts to reach out to descendants. The committee was formed in 2023, based on one of the recommendations of the Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery report to “honor enslaved people through memorialization”. Ina statement made to the student newspaper, a spokesperson for the university said it “take[s] seriously the co-chairs’ concerns about the importance of community involvement and of taking steps that will enable Harvard to deeply engage with descendant communities”.A couple weeks later, the executive director of the initiative, Moore-Evans, stepped down, after reporting conflicts with the university administration to HR. She told the Guardian that she left for “personal reasons”.View image in fullscreenThe grave of Cicely, a 15-year-old ‘Negro servant’ of the Rev William Brattle, a treasurer at Harvard College, at the Old Burying Ground just outside Harvard Yard on 27 April 2022, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Photograph: Charles Krupa/APCellini suspects the reason he was fired is simple: “We found too many slaves.” The university was afraid that identifying descendants would bankrupt the university and so each name that his team identified was “expensive”, he said. The work that he oversaw is “just the tip of the iceberg”, he added, estimating that the numbers of living descendants could be about 10,000 people.Cellini had just come back from Antigua a couple days prior, where his team had visited the site of the Royall plantation as well as four other plantations with ties to the university. They also found a hundred additional names of enslaved people with ties to the university in public archives, he said.Cellini and his team met with the prime minister and governor general of Antigua, who had expressed interest in working with the university to explore this connection. Cellini said he detailed his meetings with the politicians to the university, but those requests were never answered and he was fired shortly after.The Antiguan ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Sanders, wrote a letter to the university after learning that Cellini was fired, writing that the decision was made “without consultation or notification”. The country wants “real engagement and meaningful action that befits the benefits that Harvard derived”, he wrote.“We would not expect a cash payment from Harvard,” a spokesperson added. “However, so well-endowed a university with expertise in a number of areas can be helpful to our country.” The cabinet discussed the possibility of Harvard funding ancestry research to identify descendants of Antiguans that were brought to colonial Massachusetts, and seeking the university’s assistance in public health matters to address the high rates of chronic illness on the islands. A spokesperson for Harvard said a letter had been sent in response, but refused to elaborate. The spokesperson for Antigua said, “I have not seen a response,” and could not confirm if a response had been received.Lives ‘spent and exhausted’ for the production of sugarcaneThe Royall plantation, which likely stretched across 200 acres down to Port Royal Bay, enslaved more than 100 people. Only the ruins of the sugar windmill remain, on private property.The stone structure stands a hundred feet tall on a grassy field bordering some woods. Here, enslaved people lived and worked on a plantation, feeding sugar cane into metal rollers through a dangerous and physically exhausting process to make syrup.“It’s pretty visceral,” Cellini said about visiting the site. “This is where lives were spent and exhausted and consumed for the production of sugarcane, for the wealth of the British empire.”View image in fullscreenThe Isaac Royall House and Slave Quarters in Medford, Massachusetts.Photograph: Paul Marotta/Getty ImagesEver since being contacted by Chen, Lloyd has felt the weight of her family history and a sense of responsibility. Her ancestors repeatedly petitioned for their freedom, for their rights and their humanity. Darby and his sister Flora had both been separated from their family by their enslavers as young children. Tony Vassall bought his daughter’s freedom, and when his enslaver died by injuries sustained at the battle of Bunker Hill, six-year-old Darby walked 10 miles home to his family. The family had been staunch abolitionists and activists, suffered through bondage, and fought for their freedom. Lloyd struggles with where that leaves her.“I just don’t know where to begin,” Lloyd said. She considers taking to social media, calling the administration and making demands. Should she protest? She doesn’t know. Lloyd’s sister, who declined to be interviewed for this article, went to Antigua and Lloyd said she’s also interested in going. “I would go anywhere to talk to anyone at this point,” she said. “Except Harvard, because there’s no one I really trust there right now.”“I feel like I’m still close to the explosion,” she said. “My ears are still ringing.”This article was amended on 21 June 2025. John Vassall was a Harvard graduate, not John Edward Taylor, as the story originally said.Explore more on these topicsHarvard UniversityCotton Capital: ongoing seriesSlaveryUS universitiesRaceReparations and reparative justiceBlack US cultureHigher educationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That was because she was always training against her older sister, Venus (“she was the prodigy of prodigies”), the only person in the world who could really challenge her. A year younger, Serena remembers being shorter and weaker and resorting to cheating on line calls at practice so she could occasionally beat her.In the Arena: Serena Williams (the title comes from President Roosevelt’s 1910 speech to the Sorbonne – “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena” so, yes, consider me told) is an eight-part docuseries that covers Serena’s rise and rise over her 27-year tennis career before she retired three years ago. Since then, incidentally, she has been busy with her venture capital firm, production company, body care and pain relief startup, beauty line and raising two children. Honestly, it’s like looking in a mirror, is it not?In the Arena was executive produced by Serena and is clearly meant to be the definitive version of events. It would be too strong to call it hagiographic, but it is a full-blooded celebration of her achievements. It is not the place to come if you want, for example, an interrogation of the techniques used by the sisters’ astonishing father and coach, Richard Williams, to mould two champions. “My dad was a marketing genius,” says Serena of his marshalling of press attention round his children in the early years, regardless, some might say and have said, of the psychological impact. “There’s a very thin line between parent and coach … But I would say at the end it was all worth it,” is as far as Serena goes here in acknowledging the criticism Richard has faced for his intense focus on their professional success.View image in fullscreenSisters, then competitors … Venus (left) and Serena Williams at Roland Garros in 1999.Photograph: BBC/ESPN/GettyThen it’s on to the good stuff. The sisters turning pro – Venus flying from the start, Serena stumbling slightly before she too took off. The beating of rivals and established stars (“I was determined, determined to take her down … I’m coming for you. I’m coming for everyone”) and their swift domination of a game that had hitherto been almost solely the preserve of a white, moneyed elite. “Little sisters from Compton. Can’t really take that too seriously, right?”Inevitably, of course, they begin to meet in grand slam finals. The footage – the grace, the power of them – is astonishing. Almost as astonishing, if in a gradually emerging way, is the grace with which they handle the competition between them, the wins and the losses. Serena talks about benefiting from Venus going first in everything, from turning pro, to handling good and bad press, to playing individuals Serena will later face in tournaments. They talk with sincerity about being pleased for each other’s wins even as they mourn and analyse their own losses. And they talk about the bifurcation between life as sisters and life as absolutely dedicated competitors and not letting either one infect the other.They warmed up together before their first joint grand slam final, the 2001 US Open. Venus won. “I can’t say I enjoyed it. I did what I had to do.” “I wasn’t happy,” adds Serena. “But I was OK. She was the phenom. It was never me.” Her turn would come. She learned to pretend she was playing someone else when it was Venus on the other side of the net. By the time Wimbledon rolled round a year later, she was ready to be No 1. “I gotta have it,” Serena grins, remembering. “That’s what I need in my life. Because it’s just an extension of who I was. As Thanos says: I was inevitable. I couldn’t stop the roll.”Nor could anyone – including the haters behind the racial and misogynist abuse she dealt with – or anything, including the difficult birth of her first child, in 2017, which nearly killed her. She retired in 2022, and plunged straight into what is already a highly successful and lucrative second act.It would be fascinating to compare and contrast another pair of sisters or – perhaps even more fascinatingly – a pair of brothers who followed the same trajectory. Would they have stayed so close, maintained the same boundaries between love and work, or would they have disappeared under the pressure of competition? Would they have spurred each other on to greater heights in the same way, or destroyed each other? Would they remain such generous supporters of each other, or have combusted by now? What makes the mind not just of a champion – but of a champion who survives the ride intact? Maybe one day we’ll find out. But there is as yet nothing to compare to Serena or to Venus separately, let alone together.In the Arena: Serena Williams airs on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionSerena WilliamsTennisreviewsShareReuse this content"

Anecdotes offeeling sickin the passenger or back seat of electric cars littersocial media, as doquestionsfrom wary prospective buyers.There is a scientific explanation behind why a person might feel more sick in an EV, though, according to multiple academic studies.“Greater sickness in EVs can be attributed to a lack of previous experience, as both a driver and as a passenger, where the brain lacks accuracy in estimating the motion forces because it relies on previous experience in other types of cars,” said William Emond, a PhD student researching car sickness at the Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard in France.The Cybertruck was supposed to be apocalypse-proof. Can it even survive a trip to the grocery store?Read moreThough EVs are becoming more popular, combustion cars still dominate. Riders have a longer history with gas cars and so have had more time to adapt to their specific cues. If a person has spent most of their life driving a combustion engine car, their brain anticipates acceleration after the rev of the engine, a warning that they are about to experience a change in speed. In a battery-powered car, the electric motor makes no such noises.In addition to general unfamiliarity, research has found links between specific features common to electric vehicles and motion sickness. One2024 studyconcluded that there were strong correlations between motion sickness severity and the seat vibrations of electric vehicles, while a2020 studyfound that the lack of engine sound in an EV might be a major contributing factor to increased feelings of carsickness.“If we are accustomed to traveling in non-EVs, we are used to understanding the car’s motion based on signals such as engine revs, engine vibrations, torque, etc. Yet, traveling in an EV for the first time is a new motion environment for the brain, which needs adaptation,” Emond explains.Additionally, the regenerative braking technology used in EVs – where the motor converts the slowing car’s kinetic energy into electricity that then is stored in the battery – results inlow-frequency deceleration, meaning that the vehicle slows down gradually and steadily, over a relatively longer period, rather than rapidly or in quick pulses. Such low-frequency deceleration tends to be associated withhigher levels of motion sickness.A2024 studysuggested the feature acted as one of the main triggers of motion sickness in electric vehicles. The study’s authors wrote: “Our results confirmed that higher levels of RB [regenerative braking] can induce MS [motion sickness].”Motion sickness is thought to be caused by a mismatch between various sensory signals the brain simultaneously receives about the body’s movement. Specifically, it happens when the inner ear, which helps control balance, the eyes, and the body send conflicting information to the brain.“Better knowledge on self-motion allows us to anticipate motion forces, which is crucial for motion sickness. Yet, when the motion forces as estimated or anticipated by the brain differ from what actually is experienced, then the brain interprets this ‘neural mismatch’ as a situation of conflict,” Emond said. “If this conflict persists over time, it may surpass a threshold for triggering autonomic reactions of the body such as symptoms apparent to ‘motion sickness’.”Being able to anticipate the movement of a vehicle appears to be integral to the experience of motion sickness, which is why people who are driving a car don’t tend to experience symptoms. They know what is coming.The interplay between anticipation of motion and actual motion experienced may be why EVs are associated with worse motion sickness, as these vehicles provide fewer clues regarding upcoming movements.“When discovering a new motion environment, the brain needs to habituate because there is no knowledge of previous experience in such a context. This is, for example, why almost everyone becomes sick in zero-gravity environments,” Emond says.As EV ownership continues to increase, some researchers are already looking into a solution for the cars’ specific type of nausea. Several research papers have suggested that motion sickness in autonomous EVs could be treated byusing visualsignals, such as interactive screens and ambient lighting, orvibrational cuesto allow a passenger’s brain to anticipate motion changes, alleviating the lurching feeling in the back of an electric taxi."

I was burned out after shepherding two restaurants through Melbourne’s Covid lockdowns and emotionally burned to the ground by a failed marriage. It had been a big few years; I had sworn off love and was taking life slowly.Despite all this, in late spring I found myself chatting online with a charming gardener-cum-physicist called Scott. A few weeks later, our first phone call lasted until the sun came up. I had been captivated by his boundless capacity for a chat but I didn’t hear from him for a few weeks after that. I wondered if it was because I’d asked him on more than one occasion to pipe down so I could contribute to the conversation, or if my cynical side had made an unflattering appearance in my wine haze.The moment I knew: I’d had lots of lovers during our open relationship – then I realised I could trust him with my lifeRead moreBut no love was lost, Scott reappeared a few weeks later and we recommenced our correspondence with vigour. On New Year’s Day 2023 I invited him over. It was another all-nighter of nonstop chatting and we talked at length about the dire state of my garden. A couple of weeks later he showed up completely unannounced, secateurs in hand, ready to tackle it.What I’ve learned about Scott since is that his love language is very much “acts of service”. He is so happy to help anyone with their annoying tasks; he just loves being helpful. But of course my first encounter with his knight-in-shining-armour routine made me feel very special indeed.Unfortunately, in my shame, I’d already paid someone to get my yard in shape (not that I admitted the outsourcing to him).Impressed by the work I hadn’t done and hellbent on making himself useful, Scott decided he’d clean out the gutters. We got up on the roof and worked together – Scott doing the dirty work and me climbing up and down the ladder with the bucket. Sharing this mundane task was an unexpected bonding experience. We’d later talk about how seen and safe we felt in each other’s company that day. It’s gone down in the annals of our relationship as “Gutter Day”.View image in fullscreenAndrew and Scott gardening in 2023He moved in about six months later. I couldn’t believe myself, the dainty goth courting a gruff tradesman. I began working at a bar and we continued to livestream our thoughts via text while he was at home and I flirted with strangers and upsold wanky wines.Just a few weeks later, in late June, I came home to find Scott sleeping. We’d always chat over a nightcap together before retiring, so this was unusual. But he’d been working hard so I didn’t worry too much until the following day.When he was still drowsy the next evening, something felt off. I called our neighbour Michelle, an emergency nurse, who suggested we go to hospital. By the time we arrived Scott was struggling to string a sentence together and was whisked away within moments of being triaged.When they wheeled him back post-MRI, he was soft, tired and looking so vulnerable.Then the news came that Scott had a 1.1cm subarachnoid aneurysm on his brain that had been haemorrhaging for maybe 24 hours. I went as white as a sheet but it quickly became apparent that I was going to have to save my emotional breakdown for later, step up, contact his family (whom I’d never met) and make some extremely high-stakes decisions about his treatment path.It was then and there, as I was confronted with the idea that I might lose him, that I knew I could not be without him. As I nervously signed the waiver, I felt pure devotion.The moment I knew: I worried he was a playboy, then a friend reassured meRead moreScott’s surgery went well but he was placed in an induced coma for a few days. When he came to he had zero filter. That rawness could have revealed a darker side but instead I got confirmation that even at his most uncensored, Scott is kind and caring to the core. One of his most vivid hallucinations, which he told me about in detail, involved him spending the entire night helping the nurses catch up on their paperwork.Scott came home two months later and, while his recovery wasn’t without its frustrations and challenges, the mere thought of being anywhere else didn’t cross my mind. Of course there were days I could have slept in the garden in a tent just to get a break from his incessant chatting but I knew I would never, ever leave him. He was my guy, no matter how many times I had to repeat myself, or listen to him repeat himself!Two years on, Scott has pretty much fully recovered and is still the same gorgeous dork I fell in love with. We spend our days pottering in the garden, or at the stove, or by the fire on cold nights. The dark days seem like another life but they weren’t – they were just the beginning of ours.Tell us the moment you knewShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

As slow-motion images of crashing waves appear on the screens, augmented by a sound bath-esque drone, the effect it has on the sweltering cauldron in north-west London is close to trance-like. When Lipa finally pops up, standing statuesque at the top of an infinity symbol-shaped stage and resplendent in a white crystal leotard, everyone quickly surrenders to the heat.It’s a white-hot start, too. Despite relatively lacklustre sales of her third album, last year’s Radical Optimism, its second single, Training Season, whips up an early frenzy as 12 dancers spread themselves across the stage, a stomping Lipa inspecting them like a drill sergeant. By the time her house-y Calvin Harris collaboration, One Kiss, arrives, there’s a danger of peaking too soon.View image in fullscreenMeeting the fans on the front row.Photograph: Samir Hussein/Getty Images for Dua LipaThe mood momentarily flatlines, however, when Lipa ventures off stage to talk to people in the front row. Giving off strong kids’ TV presenter vibes she asks each hysterical fan the same question – “What’s your name and are you having a nice time?” – before signing various copies of her album as 70,000 people check their phones.Things are forgiven quickly with the help of an elegant These Walls, performed at the end of a jutting-out runway encircled by her band, before a rare outing is given to an early single, the appropriately titled Hotter Than Hell. After she teases a special guest – a hero, a British legend, a “one of one” – confused faces greet Jay Kay from Jamiroquai as he glides onstage in a puce hat and matching strides. But as the pair rattle through Virtual Insanity the connection makes sense; Cosmic Girl and Canned Heat would have made excellent Lipa singles.From there it’s a gallop through some of recent pop’s hardiest bangers – Electricity, Be the One, a delirious Physical complete with mock exercise video intro – all performed with Dua’s unique rasp and occasionally rigid but refreshingly old-school superstar steeliness.View image in fullscreenDua Lipa and dancers.Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImageBy the encore, complete with a pummelling remix of New Rules that briefly crashes into the electronic duo Bicep’s breakbeat heater Glue, and Don’t Start Now’s glorious kiss-off, Lipa’s a sweaty mess like the rest of us. As confetti cannons, streamers and fireworks erupt, Lipa looks ready to plummet into those crashing waves herself.Explore more on these topicsDua LipaPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Its taste, colour and viscosity are shaped by a range of factors – from the season it was harvested and the location, to the pollen of the plants nearby. Many cheaper options blend honey from more than one country, whereas single-origin honey is clearly labelled and typically has more distinctive, layered flavours specific to where it was produced.

He had achieved many hallmarks of adulthood: a college degree, a career he enjoyed, and two beloved dogs. But he’d never had a relationship, or even a sexual partner.”Scores of Christian men in the United States have been raised on ideas of abstinence and “purity” – what, asked Jessica Bateman, does that mean for their sex lives later on?Read more2.‘The city is being hollowed out’: the billionaire landlord locked in a David v Goliath battle for London’s West EndView image in fullscreenThe board of the Prince Charles Cinema says ‘Damn the man, save the PCC’.Photograph: Tim P Whitby/Getty ImagesThe Prince Charles Cinema is beloved by film-lovers and counts the like of Christopher Nolan as a fan. But its future is at risk due to a David v Goliath battle with its billionaire owner. Writes Will Coldwell:“To many, what was happening to the Prince Charles Cinema was about something bigger than a negotiation over rent. It was about the persistent threat of closure that so many cultural and community spaces in London face, the impact of rampant commercialism on the city’s cultural diversity, and the seemingly unchecked power that developers wield.”Read more3.Brian Wilson was a musical genius.

She is feminine, usually kempt, often dressed likeBetty Draper, but increasingly workout gear in neutral tones too. Though at home, she is not a stay-at-home mother, rather someone who performs as if she is, documenting her life in dizzying, up-close fashion for us to wonder: who’s doing the potty training?”Morwenna Ferrier isn’t, she writes, the first wrung-out mother to take umbrage with this sort of performance. But, as the cost of living crisis squeezes, the fantasy of escaping into being a wife and mother becomes more vivid and, for realistic mothers whose life is a delicate balance between task and failure, app-reliance and guilt, maybe we should lean in to the term “radwife”.Read moreExplore more on these topicsSix great readsnewsShareReuse this content"

He did so by dealing with Jasprit Bumrah, the world’s best bowler, in glorious form and by coping with the worst batting conditions of the game tocompile his ninth Test century, sealed in the final moments of an extended day, with celebrations both in the middle and in England’s dressing room.Pope resists Bumrah to lift England after bowlers claw control away from IndiaRead moreDuckett, who by the time Pope raised his bat was watching from the players’ balcony having scored 62, described his “goosebumps” when Pope scored the single he required to tick into triple figures minutes before stumps.“He was just so calm coming out,” Duckett said. “He probably couldn’t come out in tougher conditions, with Jasprit Bumrah running down the hill with the lights on. I don’t know what’s inside his head, but he’s just stayed true to the way he plays, and there’s no better feeling than that, scoring a hundred against that attack, coming out in the first over. You could see it in the way he celebrated, and it didn’t just mean a lot to him, it meant a huge amount in the dressing room as well. I had goosebumps for him.”View image in fullscreenBen Duckett takes the applause after reaching a half century.Photograph: Alan Martin/Colorsport/ShutterstockSpeculation about Pope’s place in the team had persisteddespite his 171in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe last month, though the quality and importance of his latest century, given the match situation when he emerged – England 467 behind and Zak Crawley having been dismissed off the final ball of the first over, by an extraordinary and utterly unplayable delivery from Bumrah – will surely silence the sceptics for a while at least.“We’re very good at keeping things in the dressing room, but obviously you can hear the noise from outside of it,” Duckett said. “There’s noise outside the dressing room but there’s no noise in it. We’re not having discussions about who’s going to play. The way Pope has dealt with that has just been superb and just sums up and proves why he’s England’s No 3 and doing the things that he’s doing.”The mesmerising Bumrah took all three of the English wickets to fall – including snaring Joe Root with the ball after Pope’s century celebrations – and also had Harry Brook caught at midwicket in the final over of the day only for the umpire to signal a no-ball, while India dropped three catches to allow England to reach 209 for three at stumps, still trailing by 262.“He’s the best bowler in the world,” Duckett said of Bumrah. “He’s extremely hard to face. He’s good in any conditions, and when he’s coming in down the hill with the lights on and it’s swinging both ways, it’s tough. Just his ability to bowl three or four different balls with no cue – you don’t know if he’s bowling a bouncer, or a slow ball, a yorker, an away-swinger or an inswinger until it comes out of his hand. You’ve got to watch the ball so hard with him.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was expecting better than that, but it can happen. After 430 for three you expect to get a big score, because you’re sitting on a comfortable position, but after losing the toss it was very good. Headingley normally on day one a lot of wickets get taken by the bowling side, so I think we batted well.”Josh Tongue took four of the last five, to demonstrate why Duckett’s nickname for him is so apposite. “I call him the mop, for mopping up the tails at the end,” Duckett said.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

An impressive quarter-final victory over a Spain side who were the pre-tournament favourites and intent on dishing out revenge will certainly not have done either any harm.After Englandstruggled to reach the last eightwith an inexperienced squad that is one of the youngest in Slovakia, goals from James McAtee and Harvey Elliott – both of whom have uncertain futures at their clubs – and a late penalty from Elliot Anderson sealed another triumph for Carsley over the same opponents England saw offin the 2023 final. With the Netherlands up next in Wednesday’s semi-final in Bratislava, he is now two matches away from matching Dave Sexton’s feat of winning this competition in 1982 and 1984.Spain 1-3 England: European Under-21 Championship quarter-final – live reactionRead more“In the first half we were so good,” said Carsley. “The big thing is this can’t be our final – there’s better nights to come.”Spain have become regular opponents for England in the latter stages of various youth tournaments over recent years, although only their coach, Santi Denia, remained from their bad-tempered defeat in the final two years ago, when when both sides had a member of the coaching staff and a player sent off. There were similar scenes in Trnava at the final whistle as tempers flared between the benches but it was a reflection of how England had frustrated Spain after they pulled back a goal from Javi Guerra’s penalty late in the first half.“There was a major difference from start to finish: we were disciplined and compact,” said Elliott, who along with Charlie Cresswell is the only surviving member of the 2023 triumph in Georgia. “We trusted in our own ability. The football was incredible, we need to take a lot from this into the next game.”View image in fullscreenJames McAtee opens the scoring in the 10th minute.Photograph: Petr David Josek/APCarsley’s side looked like they might be overwhelmed in the first two minutes when Diego López headed over from close range and the Italian referee, Simone Sozza, pointed to the spot for the first time after a powerful shot from López struck Cresswell on the arm. But the video assistant referee saw it differently and – to the Toulouse defender’s relief as he pumped his fist in celebration – the penalty was overturned.That proved to be the wake-up call England needed. McAtee looks likely to leave Manchester City this summer, having been allowed to play here rather than travel to the Club World Cup, and showed his eye for goal when he was quickest to react after Spain made a hash of clearing Alex Scott’s corner.Jarell Quansah was the architect of the second after Birmingham’s Jay Stansfield, leading the line one of four changes from the defeat to Germany in midweek, forced a loose pass. The Liverpool defender is on the verge of joining Bayer Leverkusen for £30m, while Elliott’s future at Anfield is also in question following the arrival of Florian Wirtz from the German club. But when Quansah strode forward and unleashed a shot that was not convincingly saved, Elliott was on hand to turn in the rebound. Suddenly England were rampant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scott gave the ball away in a dangerous area and when Quansah tripped Alberto Moleiro, this time there was no debate as Guerra swept home the penalty.England looked determined to finish the job at the start of the second half but Stansfield’s touch let him down following another surging run from Quansah and his shot deflected over, with Cresswell heading the corner inches wide. There were hearts in mouths when a cross from the right fizzed across the six-yard area but Cresswell came to England’s rescue with an acrobatic clearance.Spain continued to press for an equaliser and Jack Hinshelwood could have settled Carsley’s nerves had he directed a free header from Anderson’s cross on target rather than over the crossbar. But when the substitute Jonathan Rowe was brought down by Alejandro Iturbe in injury time, Anderson made no mistake with his penalty, before an ugly confrontation in which members of Spain’s coaching staff had to be separated from their England counterparts.Explore more on these topicsEuropean Under-21 ChampionshipEngland Under-21snewsShareReuse this content"

After over two furious hours of battle, their form was reflected in the final scoreline as Lehecka toppled a frustrated Draper, the second seed, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 to reach the biggest final of his career, againstCarlos Alcaraz.Draper, who will nonethelessbe among the top four seedsat Wimbledon as a result of this run, had been struggling with his game and apparent illness this week and revealed he had been diagnosed with tonsillitis. Draper competed admirably during the tournament, digging deep to find a way through two tough three-set winsover Alexei Popyrinand Brandon Nakashima before putting himself in position to compete for a first grass-court title. He ends with a crushing result.Nick Kyrgios: ‘If I’d acted a bit differently, I would have had a Wimbledon title’Read more“I’m obviously very gutted,” said Draper. “I gave myself a chance. I could have been out there tomorrow. This is a tournament I have watched since I was young and always really motivated to come here. It hurts a bit more because it’s at home. It isn’t the big one, but every match I lose, I take it really hard.”View image in fullscreenJiri Lehecka has been the outstanding performer at Queen’s Club.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAs Draper’s hopes of competing for his first title on home soil faded in the form of a searing backhand down-the-line winner from Lehecka that secured the decisive break in the third set, his emotions finally boiled over. Draper pounded his racket into the LED screen on the side of the court, temporarily disabling a small rectangular part of the screen. In addition to cracking his racket, Draper grazed his knee. Coincidentally, the screen had been showing an advertisement for Dunlop, his racket sponsor, before it turned black.Draper made no excuses about his tendency to sometimes lose his composure in the heat of battle, but he views it as a part of his intense competitive nature: “When you’re not feeling great, when your energy is really low, you use everything you can to get yourself up,” he said. “I’m almost getting angry to get fired up. When you do that, when you give everything you have, not just in tennis, like in anything, you’re a bit less mellow and playing a bit more on a tightrope. So when you try your best and things don’t go your way, it’s easy to spill over. That’s what happened.“I don’t want to behave like that, but that’s just the way I am as a competitor. Sometimes I just play on a bit of a tightrope. I don’t want to be behaving like that.”Before the semi-finals, Lehecka had been the most impressive performer this week, defeating the fifth seed, Alex de Minaur, in the opening round and then rolling through the rest of the draw. His massive first serve and clean, destructive forehand dominated the first hour of the match. In the decisive final moments deep in the final set, Lehecka outserved Draper and dictated from the baseline.View image in fullscreenJack Draper struggling with the heat at Queens.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAlthough Draper fought impressively and served well to turn the match around, he has struggled with his forehand throughout the week meaning once he lost his service rhythm in his final two service games, he was vulnerable.

No, not at all. I’m in the semi-finals at Queen’s. I’d probably go on court with a broken leg. I wouldn’t have pulled out for anything. So I went out there, gave all I had, and I can be very proud of that.”Quick GuideRoundup: tough draw for Raducanu, Vondrousova vanquishes SabalenkaShowEmma Raducanu has been handed a testing draw at the Eastbourne Open, where she is expected to make a return after managing a back problem that has troubled the British No 1 since she competed in Strasbourg last month, before the French Open.The 2021 US Open champion took an off-court medical timeout during her quarter-final loss to Zheng Qinwen at Queen's Club last week, after which it was confirmed she would miss this week's Berlin Open, having been offered a wildcard.Seeded seventh in the draw for Eastbourne, Raducanu has been drawn against the American Ann Li in the first round, with the two-time Wimbledon runner-up Ons Jabeur her likely second-round opponent. Daria Kasatkina, the Australian world No 16 and last year's Eastbourne winner, is a potential quarter-final opponent.Dayana Yastremskabeat Magda Linette of Poland to secure a place in the final of the Nottingham Open, where she will playMcCartney Kessler.The Ukrainian Yastremska, who had knocked out former US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez in the last eight, came through 6-4, 6-4 after a rain delay during the second set to make a first grass-court final of her career.Once the weather eventually cleared later in the afternoon, Kessler needed just over an hour to beat Rebecca Sramkova of Slovakia in straight sets. The American had beaten Britain's Katie Boulter, the defending champion, in the quarter-finals and maintained her momentum with a 6-4, 6-2 win over the world No 38.The former Wimbledon championMarketa Vondrousovaupset  Aryna Sabalenka, the world No 1, to reach the final of the Berlin Open. The unseeded Vondrousova came through 6-2, 6-4 against Sabalenka to progress to a first final since her victory at SW19 in 2023. The Czech, who has been working her way back from shoulder surgery, has seen her ranking drop to 164th. \"I didn't play for a long time. I am just happy to be back healthy, and so grateful to play these matches,\" Vondrousova said on the WTA Tour website.\"When I saw the field here, I was like: 'OK, let's just try to win the first round,' and then, you know, now this is happening.\"The 25-year-old will play Chinese qualifierWang Xinyuin the final.

The French Open champion, who was watched for much of the match by his new mixed doubles partner, Emma Raducanu, produced his best performance of the week here to return to the final with a 6-4, 6-4 win over his veteran countryman Roberto Bautista Agut.After struggling with his serve throughout his marathon second-roundwin against Jaume Munar, Alcaraz served 15 aces against Bautista Agut and struck his forehand brilliantly. He has now won 17 matches in a row and he will attempt to win his third consecutive title after victories at the Italian Openand Roland Garros.Explore more on these topicsTennisCarlos AlcarazJack DrapernewsShareReuse this content"

Quite aside from the endless politicking, the forever-war with Uefa, the consorting with autocrats and the intriguing broadcast rights and partnership deals, there has been, not a new, but growing sense during theClub World Cupthat Fifa doesn’t really get football. There is something cargo-cultish about it, creating outcomes without engaging in processes.Perhaps that is inevitable with Gianni Infantino’s style of leadership; like all populists, he is big on vision and short on practical reality. It was there in theexpansion of the World Cupto 48 teams.America is showing us football in its final dictator form – we can’t afford to look away | Barney RonayRead moreOK: how will the tournament be organised? Sixteen groups of three. Won’t that mean either lots of potential dead rubbers (one team from each group goes through) or opportunities for collusion (two go through)? Oh, actually, the four-team groups at the 2022 have worked so well, we’ll go with 12 groups of four. Sure, but then you have eight best third-place teams going through which: a) diminishes jeopardy; and b) undermines sporting integrity by giving an advantage to teams in later groups because they have a clearer idea of what is needed to progress, again offering opportunities for collusion. No response, because all that matters is a bigger tournament equals more votes for the president and (in the short term) more revenue.One of the oddest aspects of the Club World Cup has been the way players are greeted on to the pitch individually, like swimmers before an Olympic final. At Ulsan HD v Mamelodi Sundowns, they may as well have gone on and introduced the crowd as well. Who needs this? Who wants this? Why does the first player out have to hang around for several minutes waiting for the 22nd player?For well over a century the two teams have walked out side by side. This has always been part of the gladiatorial ritual of football. This is the contest: one team against another. But asFifahas sought desperately to improve attendances and stimulate interest, its focus has become more and more on the individual.View image in fullscreenWhile the desire to see Lionel Messi is understandable, his club, Inter Miami are sixth in MLS’s Western Conference.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAThat is why there was all that talk, much of it emanating from Infantino, about Cristiano Ronaldo potentially securing a short-term deal with a qualifier, and why qualifying was gerrymandered to ensure the presence of Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami. But there is a potentially self-defeating short-termism to this.While the desire to see Messi is entirely understandable, especially as he enters the late autumn of his career, Inter Miami are sixth in MLS’s Western Conference, theirform having disintegratedsince the end of March. From an MLS point of view, the ideal scenario would have been for one of their sides to beat a storied opponent, perhaps push on to the quarter-finals, generating interest in North America’s domestic league. The best way of doing that would have been to have the best-possible MLS representation, but Inter Miami are in no sense one of the best three sides.As it is, none of the MLS sides won their opening game, althoughPorto’s dismal form and Messi’s dead-ball abilitymay get Inter Miami through anyway. It might also be pointed out that Auckland City are not the best side in New Zealand, nor are Red Bull Salzburg one of the best 12 sides in Europe, but the consequences are greater for the host nation, particularly when there is apparently so much potential for growth.The celebritisation of football is not new, but it is intensifying. When Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in 2016 and, rather than speaking of the Premier League or becoming a European champion, said he dreamed of winning the Ballon d’Or, it felt shocking, a player elevating his own interests and a silly bauble above the glory of team success. But that has become normal. Improving his Ballon d’Or chances is one of the reasons Neymar left Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain; even Trent Alexander-Arnold mentioned the Ballon d’Or asa motivation for joining Real Madrid(good luck with that from right-back).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s been particularly so at the Club World Cup, but it is true of almost every competition. Even the way lineups are introduced on Sky’s Premier League coverage, with the players performing a fake celebration, seems designed to introduce them as characters.Yet there is a tension there. While individual players are celebrated, the increasing use of data means image and self-projection may never have mattered less. The stats will find the talent, even if the talent has no gift for self-promotion. At the same time, the best teams have never been so cohesive, so integrated.View image in fullscreenBenfica’s Nicolás Otamendi walks on to the pitch before the game against Boca Juniors as the players are introduced one by one.Photograph: Marco Bello/ReutersPSG provide a useful case study. For years they signed stars with seemingly little thought to how they might play together. Although their immense resources won them the French league, they habitually choked in Europe. Then there was a change of approach, the money was spent not on Neymar and Messi but on players on the way up who still had a hunger for success and who could play together. The result was the Champions League and,despite their defeat by Botafogo, possibly the inaugural world title in the expanded format.If it was conceived as a two-stage strategy – build the brand through celebrity, then win the actual competitions – it has worked to perfection; in reality, it’s probably trial and error that has brought them to this point. At Real Madrid, meanwhile, Florentino Pérez still seems locked in hisgalácticovision of football, insisting on adding Kylian Mbappé to a squad that already contained Vinícius Júnior and Rodrygo, resulting in imbalance and an expensive downturn in form.This goes deeper than transfer policies, though. This feels like a fundamental tension at the heart of the game. What, after all, is success in modern football? Manchester City for the past decade have been a much better football team than PSG, and yet they have nothing like the brand awareness. Is success winning trophies, or making money? Is it winning trophies or becoming more famous? Is it winning trophies or marketing the individual?The individual walk-ons only blur the lines further, suggest organisers who struggle with the concept that football, perhaps more than any other sport, is a game of the team.Explore more on these topicsFifaInside footballClub World Cup 2025Paris Saint-GermainClub World CupFootball politicsInter MiamiLionel MessicommentShareReuse this content"

On a thoroughly muted afternoon in a stadium barely a third full, an England XV contrived to lose to a France XV even further from full strength than they were. At the death, Romain Taofifénua crashed over from close range to clinch the match with an equally uninspiring try.Worse, England will lose the services of a player only just making his comeback from a long absence. Immanuel Feyi-Waboso’s wild tackle on Antoine Hastoy in the first half earned him a 20-minute red card and with it a likely ban. England’s wing had not been ruled out of contention for the Lions tour to Australia, but now even a place on England’s three-match tour of Argentina and the US must be in doubt. World Rugby announced that Feyi-Waboso’s case, along with that of France’s Cameron Woki, would be heard by the independent disciplinary commission on Sunday; England leave for Argentina on Tuesday.Ian McLauchlan, Scotland and British & Irish Lions great, dies at 83Read more“He’s gutted,” said Steve Borthwick. “You know Manny. He’s a good guy who tries his heart out. We’ll all get round him and find out the situation in the next 24 hours.”The tackle did look a case of over-enthusiasm, but it was a rare throwback to the amateur era in its wildness. A straight red cannot have been out of the question.On an unfortunate day for officialdom (George Ford’s first conversion ran beyond the shot clock without sanction), France also played 20 minutes reduced to 14, when Woki was punished for his clear-out on Jamie George midway through the second half. Here it seemed the decision was bungled.Word came back from the bunker review that the tackle was always illegal, but not of a high degree of danger. The message was that had it been dangerous it would have been a straight red, but instead it should be upgraded from yellow to the lesser red. The bunker review cannot recommend a straight red and anyone who has watched any rugby lately, let alone since the 20-minute red, is used to a low degree of danger equalling yellow or even just a penalty. Unless World Rugby have altered their protocols without telling anyone, the decision must be considered an error.“I thought our red card was harsh,” said Fabien Galthié. “England’s was fair. I hope we will be able to defend Cameron so he is not suspended. I hope the England player is also not suspended.”By the time Taofifénua scored his try, after some uncomplicated French battering off a penalty kicked to the corner, in the third minute after the clock had turned red, France were back to a full complement. Thus they started and finished the contest in the ascendant.View image in fullscreenRomain Taofifénua scores France’s match-winning try.Photograph: Warren Little/Getty ImagesFeyi-Waboso’s match nearly started in a happier fashion, but he lost the ball in a wrestle for the line in the second minute. Instead, it was France who racked up an early lead. Gaëtan Barlot finished a driven lineout in the fifth minute, before Hugo Auradou was in support of a brilliant break by Théo Attissogbe, playing here at full-back.England responded to the 12-0 deficit with 24 unanswered points. Tom Willis barged over from a tapped penalty in the second quarter. Alex Coles was put over on the blindside by Ford, after a carry by the impressive Seb Atkinson, to level the scores on the half hour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Atkinson broke and was hauled down inches short, but Joe Carpenter was on hand to score. When Alex Dombrandt scored an excellent try on the hour, after fine approach work by Atkinson again, Tom Roebuck, Ford and Henry Slade, the hosts looked to be cruising.Just as England had seemed inspired by their red card, so France cranked up the pressure with their heavy artillery. Paul Mallez scored with five minutes remaining in much the same fashion as Taofifénua would again in the dying seconds – ugly and from close range. Hastoy’s simple conversion won the match.At the moment, the weather in Argentina is a good deal cooler than it is in the UK, but matters will be no less ferocious on the pitch. France had 30 or so players missing from their Six Nations squad – on duty with their clubs in the semi-finals of the Top 14 – but the Pumas gave notice in Dublin, withtheir defeat of the Lions, that they will not be wanting for Test-match animals.This strange afternoon in a familiar stadium will prove a long way removed from the faraway bearpits of Argentina.

Lazzat, the 9-2 winner, galloped loose around the track for about a quarter of an hour and delayed the presentations after throwing his jockey, James Doyle, shortly after crossing the line.“I did apologise to the king and queen when I went to collect my prize,” Doyle said, “and said I should have stayed in Pony Club a bit longer than I did. We had a good laugh about that.”Parades, picnics and parasols: Royal Ascot 2025 – in picturesRead moreIt had already been a good meeting for Doyle, with three winners for his main employer, the increasingly powerful Wathnan Racing operation, but a Group One win on a horse bought to join Wathnan less than a month ago took his week to a new level.Lazzat was quickly away and soon leading a group of 10 horses racing down the middle of the track. While the Japanese hope Satono Reve, backed down to start favourite at 2-1, fired a serious challenge at him in the final furlong under João “Magic Man” Moreira, Lazzat was a half-length in front at the line, with another recent Wathnan purchase, Flora Of Bermuda, another three lengths away in third.“It’s been an amazing week and that has capped it off,” Richard Brown, Wathnan’s racing manager, said. “What an amazing horse race, he’s locked up with the Japanese horse and they’ve gone a long way clear in a six-furlong sprint. That was an absolutely phenomenal race to watch.“When you saw him [Satono Reve] come in, he’s a monster walking round here but that is a very, very brave performance. That’s two brilliant rides from James from the front.” Doyle had won the opening Chesham Stakes on Humidity.Japan’s wait for a firstRoyal Ascotwinner goes on. Satono Reve ran a fine race to finish a half-length second, but he raced in a group of five runners near the stand rail as Lazzat led a larger group in the middle of the track.

The most dependable and high-achieving horse in the yard delivered for his trainer when he needed it with a one-and-three-quarter-length defeat of Al Riffa.William Buick sent Rebel’s Romance to the front well over a furlong out and the seven-times Group One winner stayed on strongly all the way to the line. He will now attempt to win an eighth Group One, taking his prize money earnings past £11m in the process, in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over the same course and distance next month.“I’ve got a picture of this fellow on my bedside table, he means that much to us all,” Appleby said. “Full credit to the horse first and foremost, and full credit to all the team.

Palace are looking to cash in on the England defender, who is a target for Liverpool, Newcastle and Tottenham, but there is a possibility of the club losing one of their biggest assets on a free transfer next year.Guéhi, who has no intention of signing an extension, remains open-minded about his next destination and a big consideration for the 24-year-old is making sure he has plenty of playing time next season.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreThe former Chelsea centre-back, who played an integral rolein Palace winning the FA Cup, needs to safeguard his place in the England squad before the 2026 World Cup. That means there is an obvious benefit in joining a club who can offer Guéhi a quick route into their starting XI.Liverpool have emerged as strong contenders to sign Guéhi and could bid for him once they sell Jarell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen for £30m. A potential stumbling block, however, is that Liverpool still have the outstanding duo of Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté as their first-choice pairing in central defence. Van Dijk, 33, has extended his contract with the Premier League champions and is showing no sign of slowing down.The sale of Quansah will leave Liverpool short of defensive cover. The 22-year-old centre-back made 25 appearances for Arne Slot’s team last season and can also play at right-back. Konaté is entering the final year of his deal and has struggled with injuries at times. Joe Gomez, another of Liverpool’s defensive options, has been out since February with a hamstring injury.Guéhi will face a big decision if Liverpool follow up their interest in him by offering enough for Palace to sell. A chance to join the best team in England and work with Slot would be hard to turn down. At the same time there are indications that clubs who can immediately guarantee him regular football retain a good chance of signing him.View image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi needs to safeguard his position in England’s squad with the World Cup next year.Photograph: Adam Davy/PANewcastletried to buy Guéhilast summer, only to be put off by Palace’s asking price of about £70m, and they remain in the mix after qualifying for the Champions League.

Spurs, who have qualified for the Champions League, had an offer of £55m plus £15m in add-ons rejected in January. There seems little prospect of Chelsea following up preliminary interest in Guéhi.Guéhi staying at Palace for another year before leaving for nothing has not been ruled out. He can speak to foreign clubs about signing a pre-contract from January. For Palace, there is a question of making sure their demands remain realistic this summer.

Even from their bomb shelters, most Israelis support his warAluf BennWithin Israel, Iran is seen as the ultimate threat. The prime minister knows this is his chance to rewrite his bloodied legacySat 21 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTShare“It’s 1938 and Iran is Germany … The Jewish people will not allow a second Holocaust.” Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, recited slogans like theseincessantly for decades, urging action against the gravest threat to the Jewish state – a nuclear-armed Iran. He conveyed the message to successive US presidents. He presented abomb cartoon at the UN. At countless Holocaust memorial events he described Iran’s nuclear ambitions as the present-day “final solution”.Netanyahu talked and talked about the pressing Iranian threat, but his listeners were not convinced. They dismissed him as an alarmist whose deadlineIrancrossed year after year without deploying a nuclear weapon (it still hasn’t). Netanyahu’s critics at home taunted him as a chicken who would never dare to attack Iran’s nuclear installations – unlike his more decisive predecessors, who had ordered the bombing of nuclear reactors in Iraq and Syria.Everything changed on Friday 13 June.At 3am local time, Israelis were woken by an urgent alert from the Home Front Command, ordering us to stay near our safe rooms or bomb shelters. Shortly after, an official announcement told us that Israel hadattacked Iran’s nuclear plantsand air defences, and assassinated its top military brass and nuclear scientists. When the night came, a barrage of Iranian missiles hit Tel Aviv and its outskirts. The exchanges of bombs, drones and missiles have continued ever since, causing more than260 civilian deathsin Iran and 24 in Israel, and inflicting considerable damage.To Netanyahu and his followers, 13 June is the big vindication. An opportunity to rewrite his legacy, which has beenmarred by his failure to prevent the disaster of 7 October 2023, when Hamas attackedIsrael, killing about 1,200 and kidnapping 250 hostages to Gaza, and igniting a devastating war that is still going on. The prime minister ignored warnings of imminent war while pushing autocracy, then blamed the security services, spreading excuses and conspiracy theories only his diehard supporters believed.The ensuing Gaza war did little to boost Netanyahu’s leadership credentials. Even after Israel had killed more than55,000 Palestiniansit failed to achieve the “ultimate victory” pledged by the prime minister. Hamas, however decimated, is still in charge, and 53 Israeli hostages – 20 of them believed to be alive – are still in captivity. To many around the world, Netanyahu’s name is synonymous with mass murder. Even in Israel, anti-war sentiment began to rise after he broke a fragile ceasefire on 18 March.Attacking Iran, however, is far more consensual in Israel. A poll by the Israel Democracy Institute released on Thursday showed 82% of Jewish respondents – including 57% who consider themselves leftwing –support the decisionto attack Iran. Among Arab respondents, 11% support and 65% oppose striking Iran.To Israelis, Iran is the ultimate, scariest enemy. Since the revolution in 1979, it has been preaching the destruction of the “Zionist regime”. Over the years it built and armed a “ring of fire” around Israel, led by the Lebanese Hezbollah and its arsenal of rockets and missiles. In recent years, Iran and its allies contemplated a plan to destroy Israel through a combination of cross-border invasion and pinpoint missile attacks. But on 7 October Hamas acted alone, enabling Israel to regroup and hit its enemies one by one.Last autumn, the “ring of fire” collapsed. Israel defeated Hezbollah andkilled its leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, took out Iran’s key air defences, and watched the Syrian Assad regime, Iran’s oldest regional ally, collapse overnight. Tehran’s skies were now open to Israeli bombers, just like Gaza’s, and rising voices called on Netanyahu to fulfil his lifelong mission and attack Iran – including the former prime minister Naftali Bennett, his apparent rival in the next election.Military opportunity notwithstanding, the turning point in Israel’s war planning was Donald Trump’s second coming to the White House. Netanyahu believed he could extract an unprecedented green light to hit the uranium-enrichment and missile plants in Iran. Israel’s military top brass was reluctant to act without the US consent that had never arrived. With Trump back in office, Netanyahu overcame his doubts. The Americans were aware of the war preparations in Israel. But Trump had bad news for Netanyahu. He opted for negotiating a new nuclear deal with Iran, seven years afterhe had ditchedBarack Obama’s agreement under Netanyahu’s prodding. The Israeli leader postponed the operation, only to launch it when Trump’s 60-day deadline to Tehran expired. From Netanyahu’s perspective, Trump’s support for the attack – howeverlukewarm at first– has been the peak diplomatic achievement of his career.To many Israelis, the successful first strike echoed Israel’s greatest military victory, the six-day war of 1967. American analysts were quick to declare Israel the new regional hegemon. Even as millions of Israelis were running to their shelters several times a day, Netanyahu and the IDF leadership exuded euphoria, all but eager to erase their 7 October disaster and the Gaza quicksand. They raised high expectations for direct US intervention – needed to destroy Iran’sunderground nuclear plant– and for regime change in Tehran, threatening the assassination of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.We’re on the brink of a disastrous, illegal conflagration in the Middle East. Trump must be stopped | Fawaz GergesRead moreBut Netanyahu, who was drafted to IDF special forces shortly after the six-day war, should have known the dire lessons of 1967: bragging leads to complacency, which leads to disaster – as happened in 1973, when Egypt and Syria fought back. Brilliant tactical moves are no guarantee for victory, as they morph into mission creep and indecisive attrition. Israel’s success in rolling back Iran’s nuclear programme is still unclear, but conducting a “war of cities” between Tehran and Tel Aviv will be clearly devastating.The first days of his Iranian campaign brought Netanyahu a moment of relief from his political troubles. His corruption trial, where he is facing cross-examination, is postponed. Opposition leaders applauded his decision to attack Iran. And the 7 October reruns and stories about the hostages, constant reminders of Netanyahu’s failure, are off primetime television.Yet true to form, Netanyahu is showing no interest in reconciliation with his real or imaginary rivals. On the contrary, he appears to view his new heroic credentials as a means to double down on his race to turn Israel into a theocratic autocracy, a Hebrew-speaking version of Iran. His critics were hardly surprised when, visiting a bombed hospital in Beersheba, he spoke of his familypaying the “cost” of war, having had to postpone his younger son’s wedding. To them it was another example of his condescending detachment from the plight of ordinary Israelis. His critics dismiss the decision to attack Iran as politically motivated and careless. They are a minority, according to a Channel 13 poll released on Wednesday, in which 64% of respondentsbelieved that Netanyahutruly wants to rid Israel of Iran’s nukes and missiles, and only 28% attributed political motives to his war decision. But their support for the destruction ofNatanz and Fordow, and even of getting rid of Iran’s rulers, was not translated to an intention to vote for the current coalition, which remains unpopular.Netanyahu’s vindication, apparently, would take much more than bombing sorties over Iran.Aluf Benn is the editor-in-chief of HaaretzExplore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuOpinionIsraelIranMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

For more than a decade he was in the living rooms of millions of Americans most weeks, picking winners, barking his judgment. Viewers did not see the squadrons of producers, camera operators, sound people, makeup artists, fixers and fawners. Truthiness trumps honesty as most of us understand the concept of accuracy.As a nearly 80-year-old, DJT has instinctively absorbed the lessons of television all his life. While others struggled to make sense of communications scholar Marshall McLuhan’s theory that “the medium is the message”, he lived it. He strove to be an influencer before the term was invented; he was, and continues to be, theultimate product placement. The sneers of others fed him.Fibs and exaggeration have always been part of politics – but who knows what lies are now being pushed online? | Julianne SchultzRead moreFor all the talk about the power of social media, Elon Musk, learned at his expense that while his platform is great for proclamations, self-promotion and advertising, its narrative power still does not match the ingrained habits of television storytelling. “I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far,” he posted, waving a white flag on X.Meanwhile, the rest of us nodded sagely, we knew this would happen, pass the popcorn, enjoy the show.Except this is not a show, even though the logic of television we have all grown up with encourages us to think it is. The man at its centre has the capacity, literally, to destroy the world.This fact that no doubt lingered in the minds of other world leaders as he made a typically attention-winning departure from the G7 Canadian summit last week. Hequickly slapped down the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who with typical candour, suggested the president had left to broker peace in the Middle East.Like all stars, DJT also has an enormous capacity to charm. Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic who did enormous (temporary) damage to the new regime when he revealed he had been included in a classified group chat on Signal organised by Mike Waltz, who not long afterwards ceased to be the president’s national security adviser. Goldberg describes a subsequent meeting in thegilded Oval Office: “What I found on this particular meeting was a Trump who was low-key, attentive and eager to convince us that he is good at his job and good for the country. It isn’t easy to escape the tractor beam of his charisma, but somehow we managed.”While a young DJT was absorbing the lessons of the age of television in midtown Manhattan, 50 blocks south, Neil Postman, a brilliant scholar at New York University, feared where this new manufactured reality might lead. In his erudite, yet snappily titled treatise, Amusing Ourselves to Death, Postman described the way the methods of television had transformed, and in his mind debased, the public sphere. Entertainment and emotion prevail; the worst tendencies in human nature pandered to; truthiness is enough.Postman had little objection to television as entertainment, what worried him was when these methods and rituals were also adopted in news and current affairs, in the serious programs that provide the information that inform big decisions. As we would say now, nuance and complexity are lost.He turned time and again to Aldous Huxley to make sense of what he feared was unfolding. “He was trying to tell us that what afflicted the people in Brave New World was not that they were laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know what they were laughing about and why they had stopped thinking.”Australians have soundly rejected Trump-style culture wars. Now Albanese must act with courage and vision | Julianne SchultzRead moreWe are the poorer for not knowing what Postman would make of this moment. He died a year before the first season of The Apprentice went to air in 2004, with “decent ratings and mocking reviews”. DJT took an elevator 21 floors down to the pretend boardroom on the fourth floor of Trump Tower, where contestants who had been set tasks to rescue his failing enterprises awaited his judgment.As Emily Nussbaum documents in Cue the Sun, at that point no one understood how he would use the platform as a stepping stone to his grander ambition. When he did, one of the early apprentices urged voters to look beyond the artifice of television and recognise the risk.Celebrity was transformed into a vocation. The real world a B-roll backdrop.Australian networks were quick to adopt the formats of reality television, in the process creating some of the best in the genre. Our Housewives of … are considered some of the greatest, and Alone has restored a lost sense of authenticity.Despite Pauline Hanson dancing with the stars, there is still a line between public life and entertainment. But it is getting fuzzier as the attention seeking demands of the contemporary online media environment reward froth and emotion more than substance. Preserving this distinction between real and make-believe is more important than ever.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of Australia, the co-editor ofFirst Things First (Griffith Review)and the librettist of the multi-award-winning opera Black RiverExplore more on these topicsMediaOpinionReality TVDonald TrumpTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

Stop this madness nowDale VinceThe evidence against the Drax power station is damning, yet the government wants to continue its massive public fundingSat 21 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 21 Jun 2025 06.14 EDTShareHow green is this? We pay billions of pounds to cut downancient forestsin the US and Canada, ship the wood across the Atlantic in diesel tankers, then burn it in a Yorkshire-based power station.Welcome to the scandal of Drax, whereBritain’s biggest pollutergets to play climate hero. The reality is that billions in public subsidies has enabled Drax to generate electricity by burning300m trees. Now the government is trying to force through anextensionthat would grant Drax an estimated£1.8bn in public subsidieson top of the£11bn it has already pocketed, keeping this circus going until at least 2031.This isn’t green energy. The mathematics alone should horrify anyone who cares about value for money or the environment. Burning wood creates18% more CO2 emissions than coal. Even if you replant every tree Drax destroys,it takes up to a centuryfor new growth to reabsorb the carbon released. We’re supposed to reach net zero by 2050, not 2125.Yet through circus-trick accounting, all of Drax’s massive emissions magically disappear from Britain’s climate ledger. They’ve simply been wished away –counted as “zero”, while the company becomes our largest single contributor to climate breakdown.Extraordinarily, this scandal unites opposition across the political spectrum. From the Greens to Reform, from the Morning Star to the Daily Telegraph, there’s rare consensus thatDraxrepresents everything wrong with our approach to climate policy.The Labour-dominated public accounts committeecondemnedDrax as a “white elephant” that’s been allowed to “mark its own homework” while claiming “billions upon billions” in subsidies. A Lords committee agreed, saying parliament needs to see key documentsbefore approving any more funding.I don’t agree with Ed Miliband on everything – we clearly have different views on nuclear power. I respect the energy secretary’s commitment to tackling climate crisis, and it is worth noting that the further subsidies arehalf of what was previously on offerfor Drax. But that’s exactly why continuing to subsidise Drax at all is so disappointing.When Miliband announced his plans to “ramp up”biomass burning back in 2009, he was genuinely trying to find alternatives to fossil fuels. But 16 years on, this policy has gone badly astray. What was meant to be a bridge to renewable energy is actually making emissions worse.If,on Monday, the House of Lords votes to extend this unabated wood burning for another four years, what is to stop these subsidies being extended again and again? And why should the government deal with a firm as untrustworthy as Drax? Perhaps most damning is what Drax refuses to reveal. After the BBC’s devastatingPanorama investigationinto the company’s destruction of Canadian primary forests, Drax asked auditor KPMG to investigate, hoping for a clean bill of health. However, the evidence was so damning that the reports are still beinghidden from the public.If Drax has nothing to hide, why not publish these reports? A former top Treasury official turned whistleblower accused it of deliberatelyconcealing unsustainable practicesto secure subsidies. The case, now settled, raises questions of dishonesty that should disqualify any company from public funding.The extra billions Drax is seeking could help build enough wind and solar capacity to power millions of homes. It could create permanent jobs in genuine renewable industries, not temporary employment destroying irreplaceable ecosystems. Every pound spent subsidising tree burning is a pound not invested in technologies that could actually deliver net zero. While other countries race ahead with wind, solar and battery storage, we’re burning money on the most primitive fuel known to humanity.Calls for Drax to be forced to fully disclose its biomass sourcingRead moreThere’s a huge loophole in the government’s pledge to stop Drax burning trees from primary forest. Their restrictions on Drax only apply to subsidised electricity supplied to the grid. Drax wants to power private data centres but there is no plan that prevents it from destroying ancient forests to power 21st-century AI searches.That means Drax could be cutting down even more primary forests than it does today. MPs have lost trust in the government’s ability to hold Drax to account – the criticism from parliamentary committees has been brutal.The environmental movement didn’t fight to establish renewable energy so politicians could facilitate the burning of ancient forests that took millennia to grow. Real climate action means making hard choices, not hiding behind accounting tricks that make our emissions disappear on paper while making them worse in reality.It is time forLabourMPs to speak up; the fight for net zero is hard enough. More subsidies for Drax’s wood burning in the name of sustainability is just more fuel on that fire.Dale Vince is a green energy industrialist and campaignerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In a nearly two-hour long interview on Carlson’s own channel and in Cruz’s Washington office, Carlson repeatedly grilled, roasted, and fried the Texas senator, exposing a deepening rift within the Maga movement and showing us the hollowness of our so-called leaders along the way.You don’t have to be a fan of Carlson to enjoy the spectacle of a Republican civil war. Carlson, who once hosted a show on CNN, established his reputation on Fox News and then became “a racist demagogue and promoter of far-right disinformation and dangerous conspiracy theories”, as a 2023 profile in Mother Jonesdescribedhim. While at Fox, he was for a time thehighest ratedpersonality on cable TV and was deeply influential in setting the conservative agenda. On air at Fox – and inthis essayfor Politico – he praised Trump. Off-air, he wastextinghis colleagues a different opinion: “We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights,” Carlson wrote in a text sent on 4 January 2021. “I truly can’t wait,” he wrote, adding: “I hate him passionately.”So there’s something fishy about Carlson. We all know it. Even Fox knew it. He was abruptly fired from the network in 2023 and later launched his own streaming service, the Tucker Carlson Network, in December 2023. His 2024 interview of Vladimir Putin has raised questions about judgment. “I am definitely more sympathetic to Putin than Zelenskyy,” hetoldNewsNation. Questionable, to say the least.Carlson is also a much under-appreciated actor. He will explode in giddy laughter in one second only to turn accusatory the next. He lures you in with a goofy gaze, but he is extremely quick on his feet. He somehow always looks like he just got back from summer vacation. People call him a pundit. I think of him more as a performance artist.While the interview with Cruz illustrates some of Carlson’s abilities, it was also a masterclass in highlighting Cruz’s main talent. Over the years, Cruz has honed the marvelous skill of brilliantly showcasing his own limitations (such as the time Cruzran offto Cancún in the middle of a devastating power outage that occurred during a deep freeze in Texas).The Carlson-Cruz interview centered on a few topics: the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) on American politics, if Aipac should register as a foreign agent (Carlson: Yes. Cruz: No), and who blew up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, among others.The question of the United States going to war with Iran, however, was at the center of theinterview, as it is also at the center of our national politics right now.“How many people live inIran, by the way?” Carlson asks Cruz. “I don’t know the population,” Cruz responds. “You don’t know the population of the country you seek to topple?” Carlson asks, incredulously. Cruz shoots back. “How many people live in Iran?” Carlson quickly responds, “92 million. How could you not know that?” “I don’t sit around memorizing population tables,” Cruz says defensively.“Well, it’s kind of relevant because you’re calling for the overthrow of the government,” Carlson says. “I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran!” “You’re a senator who’s calling for the overthrow of their government. You don’t know anything about the country!” “No. You don’t know anything about the country!”And so it went. The whole fiasco was at times childish, other moments vindictive, but all over simply wonderful, as the Maga world implodes on its own fissures, ignorance, and contradictions.A case in point. Cruz repeatedly lashes out at the Iranian regime for basing its politics on religion, while he wishes to use his own theology to justify his politics. Carlson is having none of it. Itbeganwith Cruz telling Carlson that he was “taught from the bible that those who bless Israel will be blessed, and those who curse Israel will be cursed. And from my perspective, I want to be on the blessing side of things.”“Those who bless the government of Israel?” Carlson asks. Cruz responds that “it doesn’t say the government of Israel. It says the nation of Israel. That’s in the Bible. As a Christian, I believe that.” Carlson presses Cruz. “Where is that?” “I can find it for you. I don’t have the scripture off the tip of my, pull out the phone and use Google.”“It’s in Genesis,” Carlson quickly says. “So you’re quoting a Bible phrase that you don’t have context for and you don’t know where it is, and that’s like your theology? I’m confused.”The Maga movement is doomed to self-destruct at some point, full as it of too many contradictory tendencies. We already saw it crack when Elon and Donald took a relationship pause recently. But there are other fractures. Trump ran on a platform that was supposed to end all wars immediately. That clearly hasn’t happened. In fact, he may soon bring the United States into another endless war in the Middle East.The prospect iswidely disliked, even by his base. Only 19% of those who voted for Trump in 2024think“the US military should get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran”. Maga diehard Marjorie Taylor Greene now calls Fox News “propaganda”,sayingthe American people have been “brainwashed into believing that America has to engage in these foreign wars in order for us to survive, and it’s absolutely not true.” Steve Bannon, a key influence on Trump,toldreporters this week that “We don’t want any more forever wars.” He added: “We can’t do this again. We’ll tear the country apart. We can’t have another Iraq.”For his part, Trump offered his typically bold leadership by tellingreporters“Nobody knows what I’m going to do.” Presumably that nobody also includes him. The White House latersaidthat Trump will “make a decision on whether to attack Iran within two weeks”. Bannon further believes that, if Trump does drag the US into war, most of his base will ultimately follow. The Democratic party, unsurprisingly, can’t decide what it wants, though only10%of those who voted for Harris in 2024 favor going to war.In other words, the US entering Israel’s war with Iran is massively disliked across the political spectrum. But that doesn’t mean it won’t happen. Our fractured and hollow politics may actually enable it. If it happens, the Maga movement may not survive, but do they really have to take the rest of us down with them along the way?Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpIranUS foreign policyTed CruzTucker CarlsonMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

It’s ironic, then, that the past is precisely where Carpenter’s most outspoken critics could do with looking. It’s clear that the general consensus is lurching grimly to the right when it comes to gender, and a new generation of young, female critics should be wary of falling into step. The debate about how we look at women, and what they want, risks limply missing the point.In the past few weeks, Sydney Sweeney has been chastised forselling sexy soap, and Addison Rae scolded for dancing in her underwear on stage. It’s odd that the backlash has been so immense, given the celebration of Halina Reijn’s Babygirl film just a few months ago. The SheEO Nicole Kidman slurping milk out of a saucer? Hot. Sweeney’s dirty bathwater? Degrading and vapid. Seemingly, Kidman’s age made the former radically feminist, and by extension, permissible in the eyes of the kink police.It is relevant that these debates now take place on online platforms. At their best, these spaces could provide a rare forum for popular culture to be taken seriously. From uses of the “sexy virgin” trope to golden-age glam fantasies of whiteness, to the transformative influence of a queer audience, there are so many interesting things to say about women such as Carpenter, Sweeney and Rae, and how we are encouraged to read them. Instead, the conversation is dictated by sexist algorithms, financially rewarding those with the most extreme views. Liberation no longer brings clicks, and so to open TikTok is to fall headfirst into a sea of diatribes so puritanical they’d bring a tear to Oliver Cromwell’s eye.View image in fullscreenAddison Rae performs live in New York on 5 June.Photograph: Daniel Zuchnik/Getty Images for SpotifyNone of this is to say that to criticise the pop girlies is blasphemy, but vitriolic chastisement is no substitute for meaningful critique. One TikTok user, priding herself on inspiring tellings of “Herstory”, asserts: “Sabrina knows nothing … [she is] a disgrace to every woman that has ever lived.” Oddly, accounts like this have a fetishistic preference for girlbosses centuries dead, happy to build a brand around celebrating “first” women (authors, chemists, queens, you name it), while throwing abuse at those making headlines today. If only, the inference usually seems to be, young women such as Carpenter could be as good at feminism as Jane Austen or Anne Boleyn.In fact, the real lessons are to be learned from histories a little more recent. These critiques seem largely ignorant of the “sex wars” of the 1970s, which saw militant feminists such as Andrea Dworkin argue that whatever the context, pornographic imagery was hateful, exploitative and male. Against her were sex-positive feminists such as Angela Carter, attempting to think generously and with complexity about desire and domination in women’s lives. If anyone could be bothered to dig it out, Carter’s 1978 book The Sadeian Woman might turn the argument about Carpenter on its head. There, she historicises the “good bad girl”, “blonde, buxom” with a “childlike charm”, suggesting the impossibility of writing about power and sex without writing about capitalism too. For Carter, pornographic imagery, playing on domination and subordination, wasn’t to be straightforwardly judged or disregarded, but might instead be seen as “a critique of current relations”.View image in fullscreenThe cover of Carpenter’s new album, Man’s Best Friend.Photograph: Island RecordsFor all that the sex wars were aggressively fought, they were also full of rich argument, breadth and a long-lost awareness of economic forces. One thing Dworkin did get right was pornography’s grim realities when constrained to a ruthless commercial sphere. When it comes to the multibillion-pound porn industry and the world of pop, those with the real power, much like the anonymous, suited man on the cover of Carpenter’s album, rarely appear in frame.It’s ironic, then, that in January, no less than the record producer Pete Waterman singled out Carpenter as a small blond symbol of sexism. She was, he claimed, setting women’s rights back years, adding: “If you’re asking to be respected, don’t come on in a G-string.” I’m not sure Carpenter needs to beg for respect from those cooped up in the retirement home for pop producers presumably still profiting from Kylie’s hotpants, but those comments serve to remind us that little has changed when it comes to raking in the cash. That latter-day Pete Watermans are still those benefiting, in this case from charged debates about violence against women, is what socialist-feminists would have been pointing out decades ago, and precisely what we should be talking about today.If images of sexual subordination make some feminists uncomfortable, we should talk about that too. Instead, we’re reverting to ironically paternalistic tellings off. Of course, it should come as little surprise to find the parameters of feminine sexuality being policed under the patronising pretence of concern for women’s safety. It’s precisely this logic that has been weaponised against transgender women for years. The result? A feminism that packs women into smaller and smaller boxes with every convenient transgression that comes along.We might ask questions about the unhappy marriage of capitalism and kink, but suggesting that women who want to experiment consensually with images of domination should in some way take the blame for male violence is dangerous, distracting and ignorant of history. Decades of work (against, for instance, the so-called “rough sex defence”) have been spent protecting women’s right to express themselves sexually without fear of harm – it isn’t “choice feminism” to try to hold that ground.“I can’t escape your history,” sings Carpenter on a 2022 track. If only those attacking her felt the same way about the feminism they invoke, they might see what’s really going on here. It’s not so much a return to sexy pop that is restricting women as the censorious criticisms that pop’s profit-driven branding seems perfectly calculated to provoke.Jennifer Jasmine White is a writer and academicExplore more on these topicsFeminismOpinionSabrina CarpenterWomenMusic industryPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

There, he shot Hoffman nine times, critically wounding him, and shot his wife eight times as,relatives say, she threw her body over her daughter to shield her. He next drove to the home of the former house speakerMelissa Hortman, forced his way in, and killed her and her husband, officials say.The police arrived and Boelter fled, abandoning his car. In it they allegedly discovered a “kill list” of dozens offederal and state Democratic officials, mostly from Minnesota but also prominent Democrats in other midwestern states, and the sites of women’s healthcare centers and Planned Parenthood donors. He left behind notebooks with detailed descriptions of his target locations. On the lam, Boelter sent atext messageto his family: “Dad went to war last night.”As soon as the earliest reports of the murders were published, with the sketchy information that Boelter had been appointed by Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, to one of many state boards, on which there are currently more than 342 vacancies, therightwing swarm began spreading the falsehoodthat he was Walz’s hitman. Mike Cernovich, a notorious conspiracy-monger with a large following on X,tweeted: “Did Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?”A US senator’s X posts after the Minnesota shootings were horrific – and predictable | Austin SaratRead moreElon Musk jumped in, writing on X: “The far left is murderously violent.” The far-right activistLaura Loomer, who occasionally surfaces as an intimate of Donald Trump,tweetedthat Boelter and Walz were “friends” and that Walz should be “detained” by the FBI.Within hours, Mike Lee, a Republican senator for Utah, used the platform of his office to push the disinformation. Over eerie night-time photos of Boelter in his mask and police outfit standing at Hortman’s door seconds before he opened fire, Lee tweeted, first at 9.50am on 15 June: “This is what happens. When Marxists don’t get their way.” At 10.15am, he tweeted, “Nightmare on Waltz Street,” misspelling Walz’s name.Lee expressed no sympathy or shock over the assassinations. He assumed the distance of the online tormentor gave him license. Like the mask-wearer, both were disinhibited by their contrived personas. Anything goes. Lee was doing more than blaming Walz for carrying out a bloody vendetta that conspiracy theorists had conjured. Lee created a cartoon. The killer was enlisted by the evil liberal governor to rub out someone who was in reality one of his closest allies. Like Boelter, Lee felt a compulsion to push himself in. The clamor of the far right pre-empted the emergence of the facts for Lee and served as his incitement.But, of course, Lee is a learned man who knew that what he was doing was malicious. The facts were always irrelevant. He trivialized a tragedy in order to implicate Walz as the villain commissioning the hit. Lee’s tone was one of mocking derision to belittle and distort. The killer, Walz and the victims were all tiny, dehumanized figures he arranged to illustrate his tweets. His manipulation was more than a maneuver. It was a revelation of Lee’s own mentality and political imagination he believed would be embraced to his advantage. His depraved humor was designed to cement fellow feeling between the jokester and his intended audience. He was playing to the gallery that he knew how to own the libs. He would gain approval and acceptance. In the hothouse in which he operates, he thought his mindless cruelty passed as wit.Soon enough it was reported that Boelter was not a Marxist or for that matter a hitman hired by Marxists. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that Walz “did not know him” and Walz was on his “kill list”. Boelterwas reportedlyan abortion opponent, an evangelical Christian and a registered Republican who attended Trump rallies.Mike Lee is also a man in a mask. He altered his identity, discarding the veneer of a statesman for the Maga mask. Both Boelter and Lee profess to be men of faith, draping themselves in the authority of the law as one allegedly committed murder and the other hooted at it. They have both posed as heroic avengers and truth-tellers as they target victims. While speaking of God, the law and a higher calling, they worship at the shrine of Trump. The allegedassassin and the character assassin embody parallel lives that have intersected at the tragedy under the influence of Trump.One grew up in a traditional middle-class family; the other is a privileged son. Each of their fathers were prominent in their communities – one a high school coach, the other solicitor general of the United States. One graduated from St Cloud State University, the other from Brigham Young and its law school. One appeared susceptible to the latest conspiracy theories; the other knows these are lies but amplifies them anyway for personal aggrandizement to win the approval of the mob and its boss. One is a true believer; the other is a cynical opportunist. One is a “loser” in the Trump parlance. The other is a winner in the Trump galaxy. Both put their enemies in their crosshairs. One has been booked for homicide; the other is disgraced as a moral reprobate. One is indicted for his alleged crimes; the other has indicted himself. Both spiraled under Trump and both became lost souls, though Boelter would believe that he was found at last.Vance Luther Boelter grew up in the town of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, one of five siblings, living in a large house, the captain of the high school basketball team, voted “most courteous” and “most friendly”, according to theWashington Post, and his father acclaimed in the Minnesota State High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame. But when he was 17, the mainstream Lutheran young man became a born-again Christian, living in a tent in the local park and shouting sermons to passersby.Ice is cracking down on Trump’s own supporters. Will they change their minds? | Tayo BeroRead moreAfter he received a degree from a state university, he wound up at the Christ for the Nations Institute, a Texas Bible school that emerged in 1970 from a faith healing group founded by Gordon Lindsay. On the lobby wall of the school is a Lindsay saying: “Everyone ought to pray at least one violent prayer each day.”Lindsay was also an organizer for theAnglo-Saxon World Federation, an antisemitic organization in the 1930s and 1940s that spread the doctrine of what was called British Israelism, that Anglo-Saxons, not the Jews, were the chosen people of God. The group distributed Henry Ford’s antisemitic tract, The International Jew: The World’s Foremost Problem, as well as Nazi propaganda, and preached that God would punish Franklin D Roosevelt. Lindsay was a close associate of Gerald Winrod, a pro-Nazi demagogue, who ran a group called Defenders of the Faith and was indicted for seditious conspiracy in 1944. After the war, British Israelism was rebranded as Christian Identity, a theocratic doctrine based in part on racist distinctions between superior and inferior races. Lindsay preached “spiritual war” against the satanic demons of secular culture.Boelter graduated in 1990 from the Christ for the Nations Institute with a degree in practical theology. He wandered as a missionary spreading his gospel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In one sermon, hesaid: “There’s people, especially in America, they don’t know what sex they are. They don’t know their sexual orientation. They’re confused. The enemy has gotten so far into their mind and their soul.”Boelter claimed he was theCEO of the Red Lion security group. He continued his soul-saving. “In the Middle East, I went to the West Bank, the Gaza strip, southern Lebanon, and I would give pamphlets to everybody I could,” he saidin one sermon. He created a website for a religious group hecalled Revoformation. He managed a 7-Eleven store, a gas station, and after taking courses in mortuary science worked transporting bodies to a funeral home. HelistenedtoAlex Jones’s stream of conspiracy-mongering, Infowars.Boelter created a website for a security firm called Praetorian Guard for which his wife was listed as the CEO and he was thehead of security. He bought two cars that he fitted out to look like police cars, stockpiled weapons and uniforms, but had no known business. On 14 June, with his “kill list” in hand, he sent amessageto a longtime friend: “I made some choices, and you guys don’t know anything about this, but I’m going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly …”Boelter’s apparentdisguise as a law enforcement officerwas an expedient that tricked his victims into opening their doors. Pretending to be a police officer, he traduced the law to impose his idea of order.Christ for the Nations Institute issued astatementrenouncing Boelter: “Christ For The Nations does not believe in, defend or support violence against human beings in any form.” It added that the school “continues Gordon Lindsay’s slogan of encouraging our students to incorporate passion in their prayers as they contend for what God has for them and push back against evil spiritual forces in our world”.Mike Lee took the news of the assassinations as thesignal for him to tweet. Lee was born to Mormon royalty in Utah. His father, Rex Lee, was Ronald Reagan’s solicitor general, a principled conservative with an independent streak. He resisted pressure to argue cases on behalf of the administration against separation of church and state that would endorse government-sponsored prayer and religious symbols. He resigned in 1985,stating: “There has been a notion that my job is to press the Administration’s policies at every turn and announce true conservative principles through the pages of my briefs. It is not. I’m the solicitor general, not the pamphleteer general.” Rex Lee became the president of Brigham Young University and dean of its law school, both of which his son attended.Lee was elected to the Senate in great part on the strength of the family name. In 2016, Lee endorsed Ted Cruz for the Republican nomination for president. When Trump wrapped up the nomination, Lee refused to endorse him. “I mean we can get into the fact that he accused my best friend’s father of conspiring to kill JFK,” Leesaid. “We can go through the fact that he has made some statements that some have identified correctly as religiously intolerant.” Lee demanded: “I would like some assurances that he is going to be a vigorous defender of the US constitution. That he is not going to be an autocrat. That he is not going to be an authoritarian.” Lee remained a holdout at the convention until the very end.By 2020, Lee touted Trump as a virtuous figure, comparing him to the self-sacrificing leader in the Book of Mormon. “To my Mormon friends, my Latter-day Saint friends, think of him as Captain Moroni,” a hero in the Book of Mormon, Leetold a rally, with Trump standing beside him. “He seeks not power, but to pull it down. He seeks not the praise of the world or the fake news, but he seeks the wellbeing and the peace of the American people.”After Trump lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden, Lee sent John Eastman, a law professor with a scheme to have the vice-president throw out the votes of the electoral college on January 6, to the Trump White House. While Trump focused on the insurrection, Lee strategized with the chief of staff, Mark Meadows – “trying to figure out a path that I can persuasively defend”,Lee texted Meadows. Lee diligently worked to realize the coup plan using fraudulent electors. “I’ve been calling state legislators for hours today, and am going to spend hours doing the same tomorrow,” Lee wrote Meadows.The anti-Trump camp was in disarray. How has No Kings managed to unite it? | Emma BrockesRead moreThe journalist Tim Alberta, writing inthe Atlantic, described a conversation Lee recounted with one of his staffers about Trump that went far to explain his motive for switching from a critic of Trump’s authoritarianism to a defender. “Donald Trump walks up to the bar,” said the staffer, “and he’s got a beer bottle in his hand, and he breaks the beer bottle in half over the counter and brandishes it.” Lee said he replied: “Immediately, a bunch of people in the room get behind him. Because he’s being assertive. And odds are lower, as they perceive it, that they’ll be hurt if they get behind him.”As Vance Boelter’s life unraveled, perhaps he imagined himself risen into aspirit warrior.Mike Lee knows better. To know better, but not to be better, is his peculiar disgrace. He lacks introspection into the source of his hateful behavior, except to offer the excuse that he won’t “be hurt” by Trump. Not to feel any ordinary emotion for the victims of a terrible and unprovoked crime and instead to engage in taunts betrays his father’s legacy and the shining figure of Captain Moroni, whom Lee has upheld. His fall from grace is one of the incidents that illuminates not only his but also the true character of the Trump era.Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

All must be released,” she added.In the summer of 2020, Belarus had its largest protest to date, with more than 200,000 citizens flooding on to the streets to demonstrate the widely disputed president elections in which Lukashenko claimed to have secured 80% of the vote.‘Belarus’s people are still resisting’: exiled leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya calls for west’s supportRead moreThe violent crackdown by Lukashenko’s security forces turned him into even more of a pariah in the west, pushing him closer to Moscow and in effect transforming Belarus into a vassal state of Russia – an alliance that proved crucial forVladimir Putinwhen the country became a launch point for his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.But in the last year, Lukashenko’s regime has granted pardons to more than 250 political prisoners, a move some view as an attempt by him to ease Belarus’s international isolation.Several high-profile political prisoners remain behind bars, including Maria Kolesnikova and Viktor Babariko.In January, Lukashenko secured a seventh five-year term as Belarusian president in a resounding election victory that western governmentshave rejected as a sham.Explore more on these topicsBelarusEuropeAlexander LukashenkoVladimir PutinDonald TrumpRussianewsShareReuse this content"

That is the weapon that experts say could be used to strike Iran’s nuclear program, including Fordow.The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, declined to disclose any further details. One official said no forward orders had been given yet to move the bombers beyondGuam. They did not say how many B-2 bombers are being moved.The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Experts and officials are closely watching to see whether the B-2 bombers will move forward to a US-British military base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia. Experts say that Diego Garcia is in an ideal position to operate in the Middle East.The United States had B-2 bombers on Diego Garcia up until last month, when they were replaced with B-52 bombers.Israel said on Saturday it had killed a veteran Iranian commander during attacks by both sides in the more than week-long air war, while Tehran said it would not negotiate over its nuclear program while under threat.Israel says Iran was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons, while Iran says its atomic program is only for peaceful purposes.Trump has said he would take up to two weeks to decide whether the United States should enter the conflict on Israel’s side, enough time “to see whether or not people come to their senses,” he said.Reuters was first to report this week the movement of a large number of tanker aircraft to Europe and other military assets to the Middle East, including the deployment of more fighter jets.An aircraft carrier in the Indo-Pacific is also heading to the Middle East.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryDonald TrumpGuamUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

He was accompanied by his wife, Noor Abdalla, as well as members of his legal team and the New York Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.“If they threaten me with detention, even if they would kill me, I would still speak up for Palestine,” he said at a brief press conference after landing. “I just want to go back and continue the work I was already doing, advocating for Palestinian rights, a speech that should actually be celebrated rather than punished.”“This is not over, and we will have to continue to support this case,” said Ocasio-Cortez. “The persecution based on political speech is wrong, and it is a violation of all of our first amendment rights, not just Mahmoud’s.”TheTrump administration“knows that they’re waging a losing legal battle”, added Ocasio-Cortez, who represents parts of the Bronx and Queens.Khalil embraced some of his supporters, many of whom were also wearing keffiyehs in a show of solidarity with the Palestinian cause.Khalil was released from a Louisiana immigration detention facility on Friday evening after a federal judge ruled that punishing someone over a civil immigration matter was unconstitutional and ordered his immediate release on bail.Khalil was sent to Jena, Louisiana, shortly after being seized by plainclothes US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents in the lobby of his university residence in front of his heavily pregnant wife, who is a US citizen, in early March.The 30-year-old, who has not been charged with a crime, was forced to miss the birth of his first child, Deen, by the Trump administration. Khalil had been permitted to see his wife and son briefly – and only once – earlier in June. The American green card holder was held by Ice for 104 days.In ordering Khalil’s immediate release on Friday, federal judge Michael Farbiarz of Newark, New Jersey, found that the government had failed to provide evidence that the graduate was a flight risk or danger to the public. “[He] is not a danger to the community,” Farbiarz ruled. “Period, full stop.”The judge also ruled that punishing someone over a civil immigration matter by detaining them was unconstitutional.Speaking to reporters outside the Jena detention facility where an estimated 1,000 men are being held, Khalil said: “Trump and his administration, they chose the wrong person for this. That doesn’t mean there is a right person for this. There is no right person who should be detained for actually protesting a genocide.”“No one is illegal – no human is illegal,” he said. “Justice will prevail no matter what this administration may try.”The Trump administration immediately filed a notice of appeal,NBC reported.Khalil was ordered to surrender his passport and green card to Ice officials in Jena, Louisiana, as part of his conditional release. The order also limits Khalil’s travel to a handful of US states, including New York and Michigan to visit family, for court hearings in Louisiana and New Jersey, and for lobbying in Washington DC. He must notify the Department of Homeland Security of his address within 48 hours of arriving in New York.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His detention was the first in aseries of high-profile arrestsof international students who had spoken out about Israel’s siege of Gaza, its occupation of Palestinian territories and their university’s financial ties to companies that profit from Israeli military strikes.Khalil’s release marks the latest setback for the Trump administration, which had pledged to deport pro-Palestinian international students en masse, claiming without evidence that speaking out against the Israeli state amounts to antisemitism.In Khalili’s case, multiple Jewish students and faculty had submitted court documents in his support. Khalil was a lead negotiator between the Jewish-led, pro-Palestinian campus protests at Columbia in 2024. And during an appearance on CNN, he said, “The liberation of the Palestinian people and the Jewish people are intertwined and go hand-by-hand, and you cannot achieve one without the other.”In addition to missing the birth of his son, Khalil was kept from his family’s first Mother’s Day and Father’s Day, and his graduation from Columbia while held in custody from 8 March to 20 June.Trump’s crackdown on free speech, pro-Palestinian activists and immigrants has triggered widespread protests and condemnation, as Ice agents ramp up operations to detain tens of thousands of people monthly for deportation while seeking – and in many instancessucceeding– to avoiddue process.Three other students detained on similar grounds to Khalil – Rümeysa Öztürk,Badar Khan SuriandMohsen Mahdawi– were previously released while their immigration cases are pending. Others voluntarily left the country after deportation proceedings against them were opened.Anotheris in hiding as she fights her case.On Sunday, a rally to celebrate Khalil’s release – and protest against the ongoing detention of thousands of other immigrants in the US and Palestinians held without trial in Israel – will be held at 5.30pm ET at the steps of the Cathedral of St John the Divine in upper Manhattan. Khalil is expected to address supporters, alongside his legal representatives.“Mahmoud’s release reignites our determination to continue fighting until all our prisoners are released – whether in Palestine or the United States, until we see the end of the genocide and the siege onGaza, and until we enforce an arms embargo on the Israel,” said Miriam Osman of the Palestinian Youth Movement.Explore more on these topicsMahmoud KhalilUS immigrationTrump administrationGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Diachenko said he was able to download the files and would aim to contact individuals and companies that had been exposed.“It will take some time of course because it is an enormous amount of data,” he said.However, other cybersecurity experts said the data was likely to havealready been in circulationand contain multiple repetitions.One expert, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “We’re sceptical of the data, particularly how much of it is just repetition of the same information. It’s difficult to verify it without having the data.”Hit by a cyber-attack? Seven ways to protect yourselfRead moreDiachenko said the information he had seen in infostealer logs included login URLs to Apple, Facebook and Google login pages. Apple and Facebook’s parent, Meta, have been contacted for comment.A Google spokesperson said the data reported by Cybernews did not stem from a Google data breach – and recommended people use tools such as Google’s password manager to protect their accounts.Internet users are also able to check if their email has been compromised in a data breach by using the website haveibeenpwned.com. Cybernews said the information seen in the datasets followed a “clear structure: URL, followed by login details and a password”.Diachenko said the data appeared to be “85% infostealers” and about 15% from historical data breaches such as a leak suffered by LinkedIn.Experts said the research underlined the need to update passwords regularly and adopt tough security measures such as multifactor authentication – or combining a password with another form of verification such as a code texted from a phone. Other recommended measures include passkeys, a password-free method championed by Google and Facebook’s owner, Meta.“While you’d be right to be startled at the huge volume of data exposed in this leak it’s important to note that there is no new threat here: this data will have already likely have been in circulation,” said Peter Mackenzie, the director of incident response and readiness at the cybersecurity firm Sophos.Mackenzie said the research underlined the scale of data that can be accessed by online criminals.“What we are understanding is the depth of information available to cybercriminals.”He added: “It is an important reminder to everyone to take proactive steps to update passwords, use a password manager and employ multifactor authentication to avoid credential issues in the future.”Toby Lewis, the global head of threat analysis at the cybersecurity firm Darktrace, said the data flagged in the research is hard to verify but infostealers – the malware reportedly behind the data theft – are “very much real and in use by bad actors”.He said: “They don’t access a user’s account but instead scrape information from their browser cookies and metadata. If you’re following good practice of using password managers, turning on two-factor authentication and checking suspicious logins, this isn’t something you should be greatly worried about.”Cybernews said none of the datasets have been reported previously barring one revealed in May with 184m records. It described the datasets as a “blueprint for mass exploitation” including “account takeover, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing”.The researchers added: “The only silver lining here is that all of the datasets were exposed only briefly: long enough for researchers to uncover them, but not long enough to find who was controlling vast amounts of data.”Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University, said the news was a reminder to carry out “password spring cleaning”. He added: “The fact that everything seems to be breached eventually is why there is such a big push for zero trust security measures.”Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeHackingInternetInternet safetynewsShareReuse this content"

Well, that’s how I feel, in the sense that, if I die in agony, that memory will be a burden for my family. Not because I’m awkward or inconvenient, I may be both those things, but because nobody wants to see a loved one die in pain. Nobody wants that.”Assisted dying bill: how will it work and when will it come into effect?Read moreAsked if she had any doubts about the detail of the bill, she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think we have got this right. Having the committee stage [in parliament], with that committee rigorously looking at every clause and deciding to set up a multidisciplinary panel of social workers, someone versed in psychology, someone legal, so that they could examine it in each case.”She said this measure made it “so rigorous and so safe. And, in other countries around the world which we’ve looked at because they’ve had assisted dying legalised for some time, it has not produced coercion.”The legislation could face a difficult passage through the Lords, with critics poised to table amendments to add further restrictions and safeguards to the bill. It was suggested to Rantzen that peers could also choose to debate it for so long that it ran out of parliamentary time.“I don’t need to teach theHouse of Lordshow to do their job. They know it very well, and they know that laws are produced by the elected chamber. Their job is to scrutinise, to ask questions, but not to oppose.”Rantzen, who turns 85 on Sunday and has terminal cancer, acknowledged the legislation would probably not become law in time for her to use it and she would have to “buzz off to Zurich” to use the Dignitas clinic.Assisted dying bill: how will it work and when will it come into effect?Read moreThe Paralympian and crossbench peer Tanni Grey-Thompson told BBC Breakfast: “We’re getting ready for it to come to the Lords and, from my personal point of view, about amending it to make it stronger … I do think there are a lot more safeguards that could be put in.”The Conservative peer and disability rights campaigner Kevin Shinkwin said the narrow Commons majority underlined the need for peers to take a close look at the legislation.The Labour MPKim Leadbeater, who steered the bill through the Commons, said she hoped peers would not seek to derail the legislation. “I would be upset to think that anybody was playing games with such an important and such an emotional issue.”Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingEsther RantzenHouse of CommonsHouse of LordsnewsShareReuse this content"

The prospecting has sparked resistance from residents who fear the mines will foul the soil, drain the water and fill the air with the rumbling thunder of heavy trucks.“They are destroying everything,” said Gomes, who runs the only cafe in the village with his partner. “They are taking our peace.”Covas do Barroso is among the first villages caught up in Europe’s efforts to green its economy. As the continent weans itself off fossil fuels that poison the air and heat the planet, demand for lithium is surging, to build batteries that can run electric vehicles and balance renewable-heavy power grids.Thousands of Serbians protest in Belgrade against lithium mineRead moreAcross Europe, people living near lithium deposits appear unconvinced that mines will bring good jobs and are unmoved by pleas to stop a bigger ecological threat. Attempts to push projects through in the face of local resistance have been met with cries of “colonialism”.In Serbia, broad swathes of society have taken to the streets over the past year to protest against a lithium mine planned for the Jadar valley. In France, a lithium mine planned beneath a kaolin quarry in Allier has alarmed activists and divided residents. In Covas do Barroso, in northern Portugal, people say their village – at the heart of a heritage farming region recognised by theUnited Nations– has been turned into a “sacrifice zone”.“You’re talking about destroying an area that has been classified as a globally important agricultural heritage site, an example of sustainability, an area with a system of water management that is at least over 500 years old,” said Catarina Alves Scarrott, a member of the protest group Unidos em Defesa de Covas do Barroso (UDCB). “You’re going to sacrifice all of this for open-pit mines. And then, you start to ask: for what?”The answer, for EU officials and the Portuguese government, is to obtain a soft white metal that is needed to stop burning fuels that make extreme weather dramatically worse – and do so without relying exclusively on foreign suppliers. Europe produces almost no lithium itself. More than three-quarters of the world’s raw supply comes from just three countries: Australia, Chile and China. The latter dominates the refined supply of lithium too.A chart showing the world’s top lithium-producing countriesGuardian graphicAnxious about energy security and scrambling to get more mines dug at home, the European Commission set a target last year of meeting 10% of demand for critical raw materials from domestic sources by 2030. In March, it listed the planned mine in Covas as one of 47 strategic mineral projects that would benefit from “coordinated support” to become operational. The decision is being challenged by MiningWatchPortugal, ClientEarth and UDCB, which lodged a complaint with the commission in June.Environmental concerns about waste and water are not the only factors that have left communities such as Covas wary of prospectors. Kwasi Ampofo, a metals and mining analyst at BloombergNEF, said the sales pitch had been made harder by the mining industry’s historically poor reputation for safety and the lack of skilled domestic labour forces to profit from the work.“It’s going to be very hard for the EU to develop primary sources of lithium domestically,” he said. “Not impossible, but very hard.”In Covas, the long-running struggle between villagers and miners has intensified as political support for the project has grown. The Portuguese environment ministry granted the British mining company Savannah Resources a one-year “administrative easement” in December that allows it to prospect in the land around Covas. The villagers filed an injunction that held up the process, but the ministry quickly allowed work to resume, arguing it was in the public interest.People in the village, where a tattered banner declares “no to the mine, yes to life”, say they feel misled by the miners and betrayed by the government. They accuse the company of trespassing on land it does not own – much of which is held in common ownership – and downplaying the nature and scale of the project. But opinions in the surrounding Boticas region are mixed, with some hopeful the project will boost a neglected rural economy.Savannah Resources declined to comment. It has previously told local media it is acting within the law and makes efforts to keep people informed. It projects the mine will produce enough lithium for half a million EV batteries a year and describes itself as “enabling Europe’s energy transition”.But the continent-wide resistance to lithium mining reveals a snag thatgreen groupsand mining companies alike have been reluctant to acknowledge. While surveys find vast public support for stronger climate action – as much as80-89%, according to a project by the Guardian and newsrooms around the world – the infrastructure for a carbon-free economy carries trade-offs that affected communities are often reluctant to bear.Some residents of Covas, which is itselfthreatened by wildfires and droughts, say they recognise the tension, even if they consider the costs too great.“Every village faced with a mine will say ‘no, no, no’, I get that,” said Jorge Esteves, a forestry worker. “But what’s different here is the proximity to our homes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gomes wants policymakers to find a solution that reflects society’s needs.Photograph: Ajit Niranjan/The GuardianStudies have shown that a societal shift away from private cars – such as creating walkable cities with good public transport – would greatlylimit the risein demand for lithium, as would halting the surge in SUVs that need big batteries.Analysts note there are also significant quantities of lithium in electronic waste such as phones and laptops that do not get recycled. For the lithium that does need to be extracted, harvesting it from brine does less damage to the environment than mining it from rocks.But with 250m combustion engine cars on EU roads and next to no lithium produced at home, electrifying vehicle fleets without domestic sources of lithium would still mean extracting more abroad. Analysts fear this would largely take place in regions with weaker environment and human rights laws.“It’s not necessarily a dilemma with no exit, but it’s a real one,” said Thea Riofrancos, a political scientist at Providence College who visited Covas and several others mining regions when writing a book about lithium extraction.UK urged not to exploit poor countries in rush for critical mineralsRead moreMines were most likely to face resistance from people when developers failed to include them in the decision-making process, she added.“It’s not the environmental risks or the water risks on their own – if they’re not combined with a sense of exclusion, then oftentimes those don’t in and of themselves cause protests,” she said. “It’s the harm combined with the lack of voice to be able to say something about that harm.”In the green hills of Covas, it is unclear whether a friendlier approach by Savannah and the authorities would have won people over or simply tempered their rage. But the anger at the process is palpable.“The biggest shock initially was not even the impact of the mine,” said Alves Scarrott, who grew up in Covas and moved to London. “It’s the attack on democracy, and democratic processes, and the rights of the people that live there.”Explore more on these topicsMiningLithium-ion batteriesPortugalClimate crisisEuropeUnited NationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A study shows how they are influenced by the length of the day.Photograph: Robin Weaver/AlamyTrees and forestsWhy the summer solstice is a ‘celestial starting gun’ for treesResearch suggests longest day is a cue for beeches and other species to launch their growth strategiesLinda GeddesSat 21 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTShareFor millennia, the summer solstice has marked a pivotal moment in the human calendar – a turning point steeped in mythology, when the oak king is said to yield to the holly king, and the days begin to shorten.Now, science is increasingly revealing that trees really do respond to this celestial shift, with changes in their growth and reproductive strategies occuring immediately after the calendar’s longest day. A study gives fresh insights into why this happens, with implications for how forests might adapt to changing climates.Although it has long been known that plants use daylight to cue seasonal activities such as leaf growth, botanists have recently begun to question whether the summer solstice itself, which occurs between 20 and 22 June in the northern hemisphere, could act as a celestial “starting gun” for certain events.Last year, researchers led by Prof Michał Bogdziewicz at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland discovered that, regardless of where in Europe beech trees live, they abruptly open atemperature-sensing window on the solstice, using it to decide how many seeds to manufacture the following year. If it is warm in the days after the solstice, they will produce more flower buds the following spring, leading to a bumper crop of beech nuts in the autumn. But if it’s cool they might produce none – a phenomenon known as masting.“The window of temperature sensitivity opens at the solstice and remains open for about 30 to 40 days. There is no other phenomenon that could so tightly anchor beech trees all across Europe at exactly the same time,” Bogdziewicz said.Swiss researchers also recently discovered that trees in temperate horthern hemisphere forests seeminglyswitch their growth strategyat around the solstice: warm temperatures before this date accelerate the ageing of their leaves, whereas warm temperatures after it slow down this process. This means it takes longer for their leaves to turn brown in the autumn, maximising their ability to photosynthesise and grow when conditions are favourable.The latest study, published inProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provides a fresh insight into the relationship between trees and the summer solstice.Dr Victor Van der Meersch and Dr Elizabeth Wolkovich at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, analysed 1,000 years of temperature records across Europe and North America, combining them with future climate projections. Their findings suggest that trees reach their thermal optimum – the temperature range where their physiological processes hum most efficiently – around the summer solstice. Remarkably, this peak has remained stable across centuries.”In Spain the optimal period is slightly earlier, and in Scandinavia it is slightly later – on average across Europe and North America, the summer solstice seems to be an optimal time for plants to make decisions,” Van der Meersch said. “This was quite surprising because the warmest days are usually in July or August – they are not around the summer solstice.”If the solstice consistently coincides with peak growing conditions, it could make evolutionary sense for plants to use it as a cue – especially since this thermal sweet spot appears to have held steady across time.“Plants are always trying to find a balance between risk and opportunities,” Van der Meersch explained. “The further they go into the growing season, the easier it is for them to know if it’s a good growing year or a bad one – but there’s also less time left to use this information.”The solstice seems to represent a critical juncture in this decision-making process. “It makes sense for them to switch between one growth strategy or another at this time.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

These are going to be built.”He added: “We love the harbour and it’s hugely successful. I fear we’re going to lose some of the amazing things that have been done down there, but I can’t see any material reasons to refuse this application and potentially subject this council to legal action.”View image in fullscreenResidents say the new development will ruin the natural beauty of Folkestone’s coast.Illustration: Folkestone Harbour Seafront DevelopmentThe company behind the development, Folkestone Harbour and Seafront Development Company (FHSDC), claimed the construction would generate £21m a year for the local economy and create more than 700 long-term jobs. A spokesperson for FHSDC hailed the approval of the development as a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to secure real, lasting prosperity” for the town that would unlock “a transformational set of benefits for Folkestone”.Many in Folkestone, however, are unimpressed with the development, feeling that the units will destroy the natural beauty of the town’s coast and beachfront.Mark Hourahane, the vice-chair of the New Folkestone Society – a “voice for the community” – lamented the decision to approve the development, saying the new buildings would “permanently and irreversibly change the appearance” of Folkestone’s seafront.“Whilst the New Folkestone Society acknowledges there have been minor tweaks to the ‘harbour plan’ since it was unveiled in 2023, our survey showed that 91% of 1,350 people who took it were against the plans for the plots around the station. We are deeply disappointed that it has now been approved,” he said.View image in fullscreenDevelopers hailed the projects as an opportunity to secure ‘real, lasting prosperity’ for the town.Illustration: Folkestone Harbour Seafront DevelopmentThere are also concerns about the financial feasibility of the plans.Luxury flats that have already been built on the seafront have not sold well, and a construction on the site of the former Leas Pavilion was paused in March due to apparent financial issues.Tony Vaughan, the MP for Folkestone and Hythe, expressed reservations about the harbour project, echoing concerns that it would not fit into the town’s landscape and would be unaffordable for locals.“The strength of feeling among many local people about the development has been significant and understandable,” he said.“I think that people worry about the development’s impact on the local heritage and character of the seafront, and feel like a development of this nature is not what Folkestone needs when there is a housing crisis in the local area. Folkestone desperately needs more affordable housing.”Folkestone & Hythe district council has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsKentHousingShareReuse this content"

The labels must be “bold and unambiguous”, said the WorldCancerResearch Fund (WCRF), which coordinated the letter.“The evidence is clear: health labelling on alcoholic drinks is urgently needed in the UK to help save lives,” it said. “They should carry strong, clear messages about the health risks, which include the risk of cancer, far beyond vague advice like ‘consume in moderation’.”Kate Oldridge-Turner, the WCRF’s head of policy and public affairs, said: “Providing alcohol warning labels would empower millions to make informed choices by clearly understanding the risks.”Evidence cited by charities such as the WCRF and Cancer Research UK shows that alcohol increases the risk of breast, bowel, stomach, head, neck, liver and mouth cancer.Ireland is to become the first country in the world to include cancer warning labels on alcoholic products. From next May, alcohol sold in the republic will have to carry a warning that “there is a direct link between alcohol and fatal cancers”. The labels will also warn that drinking can cause liver disease and affect foetuses.Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, the chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance,urged the UK to follow suit. He said: “We must look to the fearless work of our neighbours in Ireland whose new labelling policy provides a level playing field for all producers, leaving no room for loopholes or hiding information behind QR codes or tiny print.“Improved alcohol labelling, including clear health warnings about the link to cancer, is not just a public health measure, it’s a fundamental consumer right. People deserve to know the risks so they can make informed choices about their health. But current labels and weak regulations are keeping drinkers in the dark.”The drinks industry dismissed the call and said warnings would make drinkers anxious.A spokesperson for the Portman Group, a drinks industry-funded body that oversees alcohol labelling in the UK, said: “Whilst we do not dispute the link between alcohol and certain cancers, and that drinking at harmful levels is dangerous and increases risks, blanket cancer warning labels are not a proportionate policy measure and do not put the risks into an appropriate context.“This can create unnecessary anxiety, eroding trust in health advice and alienating the very people who require support.”The spokesperson said most alcohol products already included advice from the chief medical officers of the UK’s four home nations to drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week. “Most people already drink within this guidance, which means their risks for associated diseases are low”, they said.In February, the World Health Organization’s European officedeclared: “Clear and prominent health warning labels on alcohol, which include a specific cancer warning, are a cornerstone of the right to health.”In a report, it urged governments to introduce them to help reduce alcohol-related harm and raise awareness of the link between drinking and cancer.Dr Gauden Galea, a WHO adviser, said in the report that policymakers should “resist all the pressure that will inevitably come from commercial actors” who claim such warnings do not work.In January, Vivek Murthy, the US surgeon general under the then president, Joe Biden, said cancer warning labels were needed because drinking led to about 100,000 cancer diagnoses a year in the US. It was the third most common preventable cause of cancer after tobacco and obesity, he added.A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “Drinking alcohol increases the risk of a range of health issues, including several cancers. That is why we recommend people drink within the UK chief medical officer’s alcohol guidelines of fewer than 14 units a week, and strongly recommend these are displayed clearly on all alcohol products.“We recognise the need for more action on the impact of alcohol on health; for too long there has been an unwillingness to lead on this issue. Our plan for change will shift healthcare towards prevention, including through early intervention, to support people to live longer, healthier lives across the UK.”Explore more on these topicsAlcoholCancerHealthHealth policyFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Now scientists say the approach might not be somethin’ stupid.Stewart, 80, is still entertaining fans with his raspy vocals and energetic stage performances and earlier this month he revealed that as well as running and playing some football, swimming also played a key part in his campaign to stay forever young.He is due to play the legends slot at Glastonbury next Sunday and has more than 40 other shows lined up in Europe and America this year, and he incorporated swimming into his fitness regime to help keep his vocals fine-tuned.“We do a lot of underwater training, where the trainer throws a brick into the pool and I have to dive in, push the brick to the end of the pool and come up,”Stewart told the AARPmagazine.Stewart said the advice came from Sinatra himself, who told him: “Rod, the secret to being a great singer is having powerful lungs. Do lots of underwater swimming, where you hold your breath.”Dr Rebecca Moseley-Morgan, the chair of research at the British Voice Association, said respiratory function was one of the main areas to suffer due to age-related changes, leading to problems including having insufficient breath for long musical phrases.But she noted it could be maintained through cardio exercise of any sort, including swimming, while breath management exercises could also help.Stewart said: “I keep myself very fit. I played soccer all my life – don’t so much any more, because I had a knee replacement. And I’ve always had a trainer – same guy for 38 years.”He has also taken up running 100 metres on a private track at his huge estate to keep himself “very fit”, he said, and is now working on his speed, aiming to break a world record.“I got it down to 19 seconds by learning how to push off,” he told AARP magazine. “I’m going to try and do 17 seconds, which I think is a world record for an 80-year-old.”View image in fullscreenRod Stewart pictured in the pool, left, picks up bricks in a pool to practice holding his breath.Photograph: InstagramMoseley-Morgan said: “Thinking of Rod Stewart … he will be feeling the age-related changes and sensibly, in my opinion, is trying to rectify matters. The breath is the power source of the voice, so without it singing is not possible.”Prof Monica McHenry, the director of the speech and voice physiology lab at New York Medical College, said underwater swimming may help people hold their breath, which could help them tolerate the drop in oxygen in the body that occurs when singing – potentially helping them sing long phrases or hold on to a note for a long time.“The basis for holding a note is having enough air to keep the vocal folds vibrating as you sustain the note,” she said. “Holding your breath will not help you get more air … but it will help you feel less breathless as you do it.”Dr Keir Philip, of Imperial College London, who specialises in respiratory medicine, said professional singers and swimmers had been found to have better lung function than the general public, with larger lung volumes and stronger respiratory muscles.While Philip said it could be that people who are genetically predisposed to have better lung function are more likely to be swimmers or singers, it was possible such activities boosted lung function. As a result, swimming may be beneficial for singers.“[Stewart] is a very active performer, and that goes beyond just your breath control. It’s the cardiovascular fitness, the strength, stamina and flexibility to be a performer,” Philip said, noting that swimming is a low-impact form of exercise that is good for older people and those, like Stewart, who have had knee replacements.“I also think that if Rod Stewart and Frank Sinatra think it has helped them then it probably has. Their lived experience and expertise is valuable on a topic currently lacking in large [randomised control trials],” he said.Sailing towards Glastonbury: Rod Stewart’s greatest solo songs – ranked!Read moreBut Philip cautioned that the general public should consult with their doctor before trying underwater swimming and breath-holding, noting it would not be a good idea for people with certain conditions.“Although there is reason to [think] these approaches might help, there is definitely not sufficient evidence to advise people in general to use this approach,” he said.“If people would like to improve their general lung health, they should prioritise not smoking or vaping, avoiding indoor and outdoor air pollution, regular exercise, eating well, sleeping well and building good social networks.”Not all singers swear by swimming. David Alacey, a renowned Sinatra tribute performer, said: “I did try the underwater method but it didn’t work for me as I felt it distracted from the whole idea of singing. Far be it for me to disagree with Mr Sinatra’s methods but I found working on the diaphragm far more effective.”Indeed, when it comes to performing, it seems anything goes. “Sinatra also developed a little cheat method where he would grab an extra breath out of the corner of his mouth while singing,” Alacey said. “That’s also great tool for singers.”Explore more on these topicsRod StewartSwimmingFitnessHealth & wellbeingHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

His father, Albert Gamboa, told the Associated Press since the shooting that his son was “an innocent guy” who was “in the wrong place at the wrong time”.Utahis an open-carry state, meaning people who can legally own a firearm are generally allowed to carry it on a public street. The volunteer has not been publicly identified as investigators work to determine who was at fault.Judge James Blanch said in the release order that Gamboa must live with his father and is forbidden from possessing firearms. The conditions terminate after two months or if criminal charges against him are pursued, Blanch wrote.Gamboa’s attorney, Greg Skordas, did not immediately respond to a telephone message left for him seeking comment.Police said the day after the shooting that witnesses reported seeing Gamboa lift the rifle when he was ordered to drop it – and that instead he began running toward the crowd. He fled but was arrested nearby, accused of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo’s death.Salt Lake City police said in a statement the next day that Gamboa “knowingly engaged in conduct … that ultimately caused the death of an innocent community member”.But three days after Gamboa was booked into jail, with no formal charges filed, police acknowledged that the circumstances surrounding the shooting remained uncertain. They issued a public appeal for any video footage related to the shooting or Gamboa and said detectives were still trying “to piece together exactly what happened”.The volunteer who confronted Gamboa was described by event organizers as a military veteran whose role as a safety volunteer was to maintain order.Experts say it’s extremely rare for such individuals, often called safety marshals, to be armed. They typically rely on calm demeanor, communication, and relationships with police and protesters to help keep order, said Edward Maguire, an Arizona State University criminology and criminal justice professor.Police said the permit for the protest did not specify that there would be armed security.Protest organizers have not said whether or how the safety volunteer who shot Ah Loo was trained or explained why he was armed. All attendees, including those in safety roles, were asked not to bring weapons, according to Sarah Parker, a national coordinator for the 50501 Movement. Parker’s organization on Thursday said it was dissociating itself from a local chapter of the group that helped organize the Utah protest.The demonstration involving about 18,000 people was otherwise peaceful. It was one of hundreds nationwide against Donald Trump’s military parade in Washington, which marked the US army’s 250th anniversary and coincided with the president’s birthday.Explore more on these topicsUtahGun crimeProtestUS crimeUS justice systemnewsShareReuse this content"

Later on Saturday, a drone strike hit a residential building in north Israel, damaging the building. No casualties were reported from the missile barrage or the drone strike.Araghchi’s meeting in Geneva had been aimed at reviving nuclear negotiations between Washington and Tehran in an attempt to reach a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. The foreign ministers of the UK, Germany and France, along with the EU’s high representative, set out a proposal that included Iran moving to zero uranium enrichment, restrictions on its missile programme and ending Tehran’s financing of proxy groups.View image in fullscreenIsraeli soldiers and first responders check the damage caused to a building from an Iranian strike in Beit She’an.Photograph: Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty ImagesEmmanuel Macron redoubled diplomatic efforts on Saturday, speaking with the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian. The French president emphasised that Iran must “never acquire nuclear weapons” and said talks should be expedited.“I am convinced that a path exists to end war and avoid even greater dangers. To achieve this, we will accelerate the negotiations led by France and its European partners with Iran,” said Macron in a post on X.But Iran seemed unimpressed by the European diplomatic initiative, with one senior Iranian official telling Reuters that zero uranium enrichment was a dead end and that it would not negotiate over its ballistic missile programme.“In any case, Iran will review the European proposals in Tehran and present its responses in the next meeting,” the Iranian official said.Speaking in Istanbul, Araghchi said it would be “very, very dangerous for everyone” if the US intervened militarily in Israel’s war with Iran.Donald Trump has said thathe will decide within two weekswhether or not the US will join Israel in its bombing of Iran, saying he is waiting to give diplomacy a chance. On Saturday it was reported that the US is moving B-2 bombers to the Pacific island of Guam as Trump weighs possible strikes.Earlier, Yemen’s Houthis said they would target US ships in the Red Sea if Washington became involved in attacks on Iran.In May, the US and the Houthis agreed a ceasefire under which neither side would target the other.The war began on 13 June after Israel launched a wave of pre-dawn strikes on Iran in what it said was an operation aimed at preventing the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran quickly responded with missile and drone attacks, kicking off an escalating cycle of tit-for-tat bombings that has now entered its ninth day.A week of war that left Iran stunned and bloodiedRead moreIn Iran, at least 430 people had been killed and 3,500 wounded by Israeli strikes since fighting began, state media said. At least 25 people have been killed and hundreds injured by Iranian strikes in Israel.At root of the diplomatic impasse was Iran’s insistence that talks with the US were impossible under Israeli fire – and Israel’s refusal to halt its bombing, a stance bolstered by Washington.“It is obvious that I can’t go to negotiations with the US when our people are under bombardments under the support of the US,” Araghchi told reporters in Istanbul, where he was attending a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.On Friday, Trump said: “Israel is doing well, in terms of war, and Iran … is doing less well. It’s a little bit hard to get somebody to stop.” He added that the US was “ready, willing and able” to negotiate and that it had been speaking to Iran.European politicians have urged the use of diplomacy to reach a ceasefire, stressing that an expanded Israeli-US-Iran war could spiral out of control.Vladimir Putin has said he is willing to mediate between Israel and Iran, thelatter of which is a close ally of the Kremlin. In an interview with Sky News Arabia on Saturday, the Russian president said Moscow was opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons but there was no evidence that Iran aimed to build any.“We believe Iran has the right to use nuclear energy peacefully, and we are ready to help,” Putin said, echoing Iran’s insistence that its nuclear programme was meant for civilian purposes.View image in fullscreenMissiles fired from Iran in retaliation for Israeli attacks in the sky over Hebron.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn a 31 May report, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran had produced enriched uranium to a level of 60%, which the nuclear watchdog said was of “serious concern”. US intelligence said Iran was up to three years away from producing a nuclear weapon.Israel deployed 50 aircraft over Iran overnight, hitting the Isfahan nuclear site for the second time. Later in the day, large explosions were reported in the oil-producing region of Khuzestan in western Iran, as Israel’s military said that it was attacking “military infrastructure” in the area.Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said in an interview on Saturday that its attacks had delayed Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb for at least “two or three years”, and that the Israeli military campaign would continue.Explore more on these topicsIsraelIranMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Back then, having been in office for just six months, Spain’s socialist prime minister could afford to mock his opponents’ frequently hyperbolic attempts to depict him and his administration as an existential threat to the country.“I know you think I’m a dangerous, extreme leftwinger who’s trying to breakSpainapart,”he told the senate at the end of October that year. “I know that everything I do, and everything my government does, is illegal, immoral and even fattening.”Almost seven years on, that barb hasn’t aged well. The EU’s last centre-left leader is fighting the most crucial battle of his political life. The events of the past seven days – and, indeed the past year – have battered the reputation of Spain’s socialist-led minority government and of the man who came to power as a self-declared scourge of corruption.Sánchez, 53, made Spanish political history in June 2018 when he became the first opposition leader to successfully use a motion of no confidenceto oust a sitting governmentand become prime minister. By then, the conservative People’s party (PP) had been in power for seven years, was mired in graft scandals and had just been irreparably damaged by a court’s rulingthat the party had profitedfrom an illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme. Its then leader, Mariano Rajoy, had also suffered the ignominy of becoming the first serving Spanish prime ministerto give evidence in a criminal trial.Unveiling his no-confidence motion, Sánchez complained that the PP had “seriously damaged the health of our democracy” and plunged the country’s politics into what he termed a “corruption thriller”.It is another phrase that hasn’t aged well. Today it is his government and his circle that sit at the centre of a web of alleged plots that would seem too numerous, too unlikely and too convoluted for an airport novel.The question now is whether the great survivor of Spanish politics will make it to the next general election, scheduled for 2027.To mangle Hemingway’s line on going bankrupt, how does a government slide into ethical and electoral insolvency? “Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly.”Last week, Sánchez’s right-hand man, Santos Cerdán, the organisational secretary of the prime minister’s Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE), resigned after a supreme court judge found “firm evidence” of his possible involvement in taking kickbacks on public construction contracts. His case is tied to those of two other men, the former transport minister José Luis Ábalos – who was Cerdán’s predecessor as the PSOE’s organisational secretary – and Ábalos’s former aide Koldo García.View image in fullscreenSantos Cerdán leaving his home in Madrid, Spain.Photograph: Fernando Villar/EPAÁbalos was sacked from Sánchez’s cabinet in 2021 andsuspended by the PSOEin February last year after refusing to resign when García was accused of taking bribes to facilitate mask contracts during the Covid crisis. Both men have denied any wrongdoing.Over the past few days, leaked evidence handed to the Guardia Civil’s anti-corruption unit has purported to show Cerdán discussing kickbacks with Ábalos and García, andCerdán instructing García to interfere with the 2014 party vote that saw Sánchez elected PSOE leader. Audio of a crude discussion between Ábalos and García in which they appear to discuss the various attributes of different sex workershas also surfaced.It’s little wonder then that Sánchezproclaimed on Thursday of last week that he should never have trusted Cerdán, who insists he is innocent. The prime minister’s accompanying mea culpa – “I have many shortcomings … but I have always believed in working for clean politics and fair play in politics” – came hours after the PSOE had denied that Cerdán had ever been involved in any conversations about taking bribes.Those cases are not the only graft allegations facing those around the prime minister. Both Sánchez’s wife, Begoña Gómez, and his brother, David Sánchez, are also under investigation.Gómez is being investigated for alleged corruption and influence-peddling after a complaint by the pressure group Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), a self-styled trade union with far-right links that has a long history of using the courts to pursue political targets. Manos Limpias hasaccused Gómez of using her influenceas the wife of the prime minister to secure sponsors for a university master’s degree course that she ran. Sánchez has complained of being the victim of “lawfare” and has described the case against his wife as baseless and “an ugly fit-up driven by the far-right groups behind the complaint”. The emergence of the allegations last yearled him to take a five-day break from his public duties while he considered whether to carry on as prime minister.View image in fullscreenPedro Sánchez with his wife, Begoña Gómez.Photograph: Julio Munoz/EPADavid Sánchez, meanwhile, is facing trial over allegations of influence-peddling and other offences in a case that also began with accusations from Manos Limpias and other groups. He denies the charges.It doesn’t end there. A former PSOE member has beenaccused of trying to wage a smear campaign against the Guardia Civil anti-corruption unit, which is also investigating Gómez and David Sánchez. AndSpain’s top prosecutor could face trialfor allegedly leaking confidential information from a tax fraud case involving the partner of Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the populist PP leader of the Madrid region who is also one of Pedro Sánchez’s loudest and brashest critics.No degree in political science is needed to see just how bad things are for the PSOE. Sánchez’s big worry now is that there could be still more damaging revelations to come about the activities of the “toxic triangle” of Cerdán, Ábalos and García. On Friday morning, Guardia Civil officers visited the PSOE’s Madrid HQ and the transport ministry to clone Cerdán and Ábalos’s email accounts.Although the PP, now led by Alberto Núñez Feijóo, doesn’t yet have the votes it needs to bring a no-confidence vote against the government, the PSOE’s parliamentary allies – who include small Basque and Catalan nationalist parties – could decide that the socialist brand is too radioactive for them to be associated with.In the meantime, Sánchez, a politician known for confounding expectations and opponents – and a man who famously called his 2019 memoir Manual de Resistencia (Resistance Manual) – is insisting that the PSOE is not institutionally rotten.“I will not allow you to turn an anecdote into a category,” he told his adversaries during a loud and rancorous session in congress on Wednesday. “The left is not corrupt.”The PP, which believes it may finally have Sánchez cornered, is not without its own issues. Ayuso – whose eccentric pronouncements tend to eclipse Feijóo’s more muted leadership style – is still under pressure overher boyfriend’s judicial issues with the tax authorities, and over her government’s Covid protocols aftermore than 7,200 people died in the region’s care homes during the early stages of the Covid pandemic.The party is also facing continuing scrutiny overits response to last year’s deadly floods in Valencia, another of the regions it governs. Then there is its own well-documented history of corruption, not to mention the inconvenient fact that the PP is all but certain to have to rely on a deal with the far-right Vox party to govern.But there is a growing sense that what was supposed to be one of Europe’s few remaining beacons of social democracy is dimming, even as the far right is gaining strength around the continent and beyond. If successive conservative and socialist governments in Spain are brought down by corruption scandals, the big winners are likely to be those, such as Vox, who rage against what they say is an old and rotten two-party system.Recentevents over the border in Portugalare also sobering. In last month’s snap election, the Portuguese socialist party –which was forced from government by a corruption scandal in 2023– finished third behind the far-right Chega party. While a similar outcome in Spain is deeply improbable, Vox’s appeal –especially to young men– is increasing.As the accusations mount,the achievements of the Sánchez administrationrisk disappearing under the rapidly accumulating weight of mud.As well as delivering an enviably strong economy and calming the tensions in Catalonia after the failed 2017 push for independence, the government has, in conjunction with its successive, more leftwing partners, introduced menstrual leave, a minimum basic income scheme, a euthanasia law and updated abortion legislation.Perhaps most eye-catchingly of all,Sánchez has also bucked the continent-wide political trend by defending immigration and its benefits.“Spain needs to choose between being an open and prosperous country or a closed-off, poor country,”he told parliamentin October. “It’s as simple as that.”The coming weeks will determine the prime minister’s future, but some believe the days of the Sánchez government are numbered.“As I see it, the legislature is already over,” said Pablo Simón, a political scientist at Madrid’s Carlos III University. While he acknowledged his view might sound harsh, he said the recent revelations were damaging precisely because they struck at the very heart of the PSOE’s progressive and administrative credibility.Simón said the allegations of irregularities in the PSOE primaries, the apparent use of sex workers – “which breaks that whole image of a feminist government that believes in equality” – the perceived hypocrisy of a party that professed a zero tolerance approach to corruption, and Sánchez’s repeated cries of lawfare and conspiracy, now added up to a damning whole.“With those four corners of the government’s narrative demolished, the situation is now terminal,” he said. “We don’t know how the legislature will end or when it will end, but we’re now in the final countdown … No one knows exactly what else could come out.”Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropePedro SánchezfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Backers of the law argue the Ten Commandments belong in classrooms because they are historical and part of the foundation of US law.Court’s gender-affirming care ruling will impair all sex-based rights, say criticsRead moreHeather L Weaver, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, said Friday’s ruling “heldLouisianaaccountable to a core constitutional promise: public schools are not Sunday schools, and they must welcome all students, regardless of faith”.The plaintiffs’ attorneys and Louisiana disagreed on whether the appeals court’s decision applied to every public school district in the state or only the districts party to the lawsuit.“All school districts in the state are bound to comply with the US constitution,” said Liz Hayes, a spokesperson for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which served as co-counsel for the plaintiffs.The appeals court’s rulings “interpret the law for all of Louisiana”, Hayes added. “Thus, all school districts must abide by this decision and should not post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms.”Louisiana’s attorney general, Liz Murrill, said she disagreed and believed the ruling only applied to school districts in the five parishes that were party to the lawsuit. Murrill added that she would appeal the ruling, including taking it to the US supreme court if necessary.The panel of judges reviewing the case was unusually liberal for the fifth US circuit court of appeals. In a court with more than twice as many Republican-appointed judges, two of the three judges involved in the ruling were appointed by Democratic presidents.The court’s ruling stems from a lawsuit filed last year by parents of Louisiana schoolchildren from various religious backgrounds, who said the law violates language in the US constitution’s first amendment guaranteeing religious liberty and forbidding government establishment of religion.The ruling also backs an order issued last fall by US district judge John deGravelles, who declared the mandate unconstitutional and ordered state education officials not to enforce it and to notify all local school boards in the state of his decision.The state’s Republican governor, Jeff Landry, signed the mandate into law last June.Landry said in a statement on Friday that he supports the attorney general’s plans to appeal.“The Ten Commandments are the foundation of our laws – serving both an educational and historical purpose in our classrooms,” Landry said.Law experts have long said they expect the Louisiana case to make its way to the US supreme court, testing the court on the issue of religion and government.Similar laws have been challenged in court.A group of Arkansas families filed a federal lawsuit recently challenging a near-identical law passed in their state. And comparable legislation in Texas currently awaits Governor Greg Abbott’s signature.In 1980, the supreme court ruled that a Kentucky law violated the establishment clause of the US constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an establishment of religion”. The court found that the law had no secular purpose but served a plainly religious purpose.And in 2005, the supreme court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the US constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state capitol in Austin.Explore more on these topicsLouisianaUS constitution and civil libertiesReligionLaw (US)US politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Three novels fully absorbed me recently.Fleshby David Szalay is a very smart and stylish novel about the 1%, filtered through the life of a Hungarian bodyguard/driver in their midst. Cécé by Emmelie Prophète (out 23 September) vividly depicts the slums of contemporary Haiti via a very online young sex worker who lives her best life on Facebook.Dream Countby Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie features a series of unforgettable women trying to work out what love means. The summer read I’m looking forward to myself isConvenience Store Womanby Sayaka Murata, a true original.David NichollsI would recommend two books, 800 pages and a shade under 150, depending on what you can carry.Helen Garner’s collected diaries, How to End a Story, are frank, gripping and revealing about family, marriage and the writing life, while Anthony Shapland’s debut, A Room Above a Shop, is a small, tender love story, almost a poem.View image in fullscreenBernardine EvaristoNo Small Thingby Orlaine McDonald is one of the best debut novels I’ve read in recent years. A family of women, mother, daughter and granddaughter, carry unresolved and unspoken trauma that’s passed down through the generations. This poisons their relationships and ability to fully function in society. Intense, visceral and beautifully written, McDonald’s novel captures their damaged souls.Stag Danceby Torrey Peters is the follow-up to her bestselling novelDetransition, Baby. Consisting of three short stories and a novella, this is adventurous, mind-expanding and provocative fiction that skilfully serves up different possibilities of gender and sexuality.Yael van der WoudenThe Pretenderby Jo Harkin tells the story of Lambert Simnel, the Tudor Pretender. It’sfunnyand it’s devastating. I’m having a fantastic time reading it.Katherine RundellMy favourite novel so far this year has beenJamesby Percival Everett. It has the satirical bite of his previous work, but a furious generosity that is its own. A reimagining of Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn, its premise is that the language of the enslaved is a learned facade to appease the white slavers. I read Huckleberry Finn first and then James immediately afterwards: a fantastic reading experience.Olivia LaingI savedGliffby Ali Smith for the perfect moment: the day that Keir Starmer gave his “island of strangers” speech. What a balm and a corrective, then, to read this propulsive dystopian novel about how to refuse the imperatives of fascism, how to stay open to strangers in all their guises. Beautiful and visionary.Reading about spycops might not seem the obvious beach activity, butDisclosureby Kate Wilson is a gripping account of an environmental activist who discovered her former boyfriend was a police spy, a technique regularly used to infiltrate and discredit non-violent activists. The most invigorating aspect of this disturbing book is how the women turned the tables, piecing together evidence and eventually winning a victory in court.View image in fullscreenJonathan CoeIf you’re heading to a British seaside town this summer, the book you should take with you isBirdingby Rose Ruane. Set in a desolate unnamed resort where the pastel facades of Victorian buildings “crumble like stale cake after a party”, and the pier boasts a helter skelter “crusted with stalactites of guano”, this is the bleak but hopeful story of Lydia, once one half of a fleetingly successful girl band, piecing her life back together in the face of falsely remembered trauma. Ruane is a marvellous writer whose prose glitters with perfect metaphors and wincingly caustic one-liners. In fact you should take this on holiday wherever you’re going.View image in fullscreenAnne EnrightLiterary biographies are a great choice for the summer: I raced through Frances Wilson’s whip-smartElectric Spark: The Enigma of Muriel Spark, and am currently lovingAn Afterlife, Francesca Wade’s searching and eloquent double biography of the life and posthumous reputation of Gertrude Stein. In fiction, my big recent discovery has been the work of Samanta Schweblin. Good and Evil and Other Stories is coming out in August and they are just stellar – extreme, uncanny and beautifully controlled. Also there’s a backlist for me to catch up on. Time to clear a new space on my bookshelf.View image in fullscreenSamantha HarveyAbdulrazak Gurnah’sTheftis complex in its themes of class and entitlement, but it’s also, fundamentally, a piece of great, satisfying storytelling to lose yourself in. Katie Kitamura’s latest novel,Audition, is slick, sharp, strange and singular. I love her work; she’s a writer who can conjure intrigue from the scantest detail, and you’ll gulp this novel down in one in-breath.View image in fullscreenMichael RosenKiku: The Japanese Art of Good Listeningby Dr Haru Yamada. It’s strange that when we say the word “conversation”, the first thing we think of is speakers. Yet, an equal part of conversation is listening. In fact, the speaker speaks with an eye and ear out on who the listener is and how they’re reacting. This is a great insight into how all this plays out, seen through the prism of Japanese culture and language.I’d also recommendBeyond the Secret Garden: Racially Minoritised People in British Children’s Books by Darren Chetty and Karen Sands-O’Connor. What’s it like as a child to read classic children’s books if you can’t see yourself in the garden? Or to only see yourself there as people who are “less than” the great characters and heroes? Or flip that over and ask, what does all this do for those who see themselves in books as always centre stage?View image in fullscreenColm TóibínMore than a quarter of a century ago in Sydney, I caught a glimpse across a room of the novelist Helen Garner and her companion, the novelist Murray Bail. I could hardly imagine that I would become obsessed with both of them courtesy of Garner’s marvellousHow to End a Story: Collected Diaries, all 800 pages of it. This diary begins by registering what is ordinary, how days are, what it is like to be a writer, a daughter, a mother, a lover, a citizen of Melbourne. Part of it is a doomed love story. So, I have also been reading some of the writings of the object of Garner’s attention, three short books by Bail: Longhand: A Writer’s Notebook; Notebooks 1970-2003; and his luminous and mysterious semi-novel calledHe.View image in fullscreenAli SmithIt’s a Muriel Spark summer for me. There’s the first volume of herLetters (1944-1963)edited by Dan Gunn (out 28 August); I can’t wait to read it. Brand new right now is Frances Wilson’s truly amazing biography of Spark’s formative years and work,Electric Spark: The Enigma of Muriel Spark. An electrifying work in itself, often as mazy and gripping as a psychological thriller and as unsettling, sharp and playfully uncanny as a piece of Spark’s own fiction, it’s also one of the most revealing books about societal postwar paranoia and nervous fracture I’ve ever read. My other summer recommendation is also a touch Sparkian in a world distracted by fakery: Nell Stevens’s marvel of a novelThe Original, a story of creativity, legacy and real worth, is full of narrative cunning, narrative goodness. What a very good heart it has.View image in fullscreenMick HerronIf poetry on the beach appeals – and why wouldn’t it; it sounds like a cocktail – Michael Longley’sAsh Keys, published shortly before hisdeath in January, is strongly recommended. Selected volumes are intended to provoke new readings of familiar poems, and this one works superbly – I had undervalued his later verse, thinking it slight in comparison to earlier work. This proves me wrong. Abigail Dean’s third novel, meanwhile, continues her winning streak, confirming her aptitude for examining the aftermath of trauma.The Death of Us, a love story interrupted by violent intrusion, is moving and deeply impressive.View image in fullscreenCurtis SittenfeldAnimal Instinctby Amy Shearn is a delicious, sexy, insightful, big-hearted joy (that, believe it or not, features both the pandemic and divorce). After her marriage ends, middle-aged Brooklyn mom-of-three Rachel Bloomstein goes on many dates with men and women, has wild yet as-responsible-as-possible sex, and works on creating an AI chatbot that will combine the best parts of all her romantic prospects. Rachel is so open, generous-hearted and funny that reading about her makes you feel like one of the friends who comes over for drinks on her balcony.View image in fullscreenRutger BregmanBury the Chainsby Adam Hochschild andSuffrageby Ellen Carol DuBois are two gripping accounts of what may be the greatest human rights movements in history: the fight to end slavery and the struggle for women’s suffrage. Both are powerful reminders that real change demands extraordinary perseverance. Of the 12 founders of the British Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade, only one lived to see slavery abolished across the empire. Of the 68 women at theSeneca Falls convention, just one lived to see women gain the vote – and she was too ill to cast a ballot. Their stories are a call to all of us still fighting today: for tax justice, for democracy, for an end to the moral catastrophe of factory farming, and so much more.View image in fullscreenWilliam DalrympleFara Dabhoiwala’s remarkable global history,What Is Free Speech?is ostensibly a very different book from his first, on the origins of sex, yet it shares its predecessor’s wit, fluency anddazzling erudition. Constantly surprising, it reminds us quite what an innovative idea free speech was when it was first upheld as a civilised goal in the 18th century. Examining who in history could speak, and who was silenced, Dabhoiwala reminds us of the crucial relationship between speech and power.How the World Made the Westby Josephine Quinn is one of the most fascinating works of global history to appear for years. Incredibly wide-ranging, it connects disparate parts of the ancient world with dazzling shafts of insight and intuition, held together by vast scholarship, elegant prose and an enviable lightness of touch. It completelyreframes our conception of the western classical world, allowing us to understand just how globalised and interconnected mankind has always been.Finally, Pankaj Mishra illuminates the darkest of landscapes inThe World After Gaza. It is as thoughtful, scholarly and subtle as it isbrave and original. By a long way the most horrifying and thought-provoking book I have read this year.View image in fullscreenSarah PerrySarah Hall’s new novelHelm(out 28 August) is incandescently good (even by her incandescent standards). It spans thousands of years up to the present day, and concerns the Helm wind, a phenomenon that blows down from a Cumbrian hilltop and wreaks mischievous havoc. There are meteorologists and stone-age women visionaries and peculiar unbiddable girls and terrifying medieval priests: it is sexy and funny and erudite and strange, and the prose is dizzyingly good. Up there with her best.I’m also looking forward to reading Mic Wright’sBreaking: How the Media Works, When it Doesn’t and Why it Matters. Wright is always excoriatingly funny and righteously indignant: this promises to be all those things and more.View image in fullscreenNussaibah YounisJen Beagin’s clever, hilarious and absolutely bonkers novelBig Swisswill have you laughing out loud and questioning everything you think you know about trauma. Greta, a middle-aged woman fleeing her past, takes a job with therapist Om, transcribing his therapy sessions. But this is small town Hudson, and Greta soon bumps into voices she recognises. When she develops an obsession with Om’s sardonic and larger-than-life client Big Swiss, shenanigans ensue.Stag Danceby Torrey Peters, a quartet of stories, covers utterly original ground, and will keep you captivated with its voice, energy and wit. There’s a hormone-inhibiting virus forcing cis people into parity with trans people; there are two loggers in the 1900s battling for the affections of the axeman-in-chief; there’s a sexually confused boarding school love story; and a trans fetishist competing for legitimacy with a trans traditionalist. And, randomly, there are a lot of pigs.View image in fullscreenFlorence KnappKakigori Summerby Emily Itami follows three sisters as they briefly return to their childhood home on the Japanese coast. It’s a book about belonging, often explored through language, with piercing observations around a family’s shorthand, a grandmother’s admonishments, and how the peculiarities of Japanese and English culture are highlighted in the words that are absent, and uniquely present, in our vocabularies. It is funny, gentle and warm, though Itami’s sentences are never fluffy. And it contains one of the best descriptions of overthinking I’ve ever read: “the inside of her head is like the final note of some operatic calamity vibrato-ing without end”.View image in fullscreenPeter FrankopanI greatly enjoyed Oliver Moody’sBaltic: The Future of Europe, which provides revelatory coverage of a region that is not only important but looks likely to be the next arena for competition between Russia and its neighbours. Patrick McGee’sApple in China: The Capture of the World’s Greatest Companyis terrific too – not only charting Apple’s rise but also that of China’s tech sector and its economy as a whole. McGee argues that Apple helped Make China Great Again. I also admired Bijan Omrani’sGod is an Englishman: Christianity and the Creation of England– a finely judged and beautifully written account.To explore all the books in the Guardian’s summer reading list visitguardianbookshop.com.

Last weekend the Hollywood ingenue was serenading surprised shoppers, but since her performance of Don’t Cry For Me Argentina went viral it’s become the hottest (free) ticket in the West End.Some stand in wait for two hours to catch the seven-minute scene. But what is the experience actually like – and is it worth hanging around for?View image in fullscreenOnlookers capture Zegler’s performance on their phones from Argyll Street in London’s West EndPhotograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAOn Wednesday night, the crowd was a mix of musical theatre fans and Rachel Zegler stans. Most were in their 20s and 30s, although an older couple on holiday from Nebraska had been sent along by their daughter, and Susan, who had been there longest, was a 76-year-old who had seen the original production with Elaine Paige.“We’re both interested in the accessibility of the arts,” said 25-year-old Sian, who had come with her drama-school buddy. “I don’t know the show, but I know that the context of the song is her singing out to the peasants. And we’re the peasants!” That sense only increased when theatregoers stepped out during the interval to video the ticketless hordes on their phones.Some in the crowd had already seen the show and were returning for an IRL version of the performance they had watched on screen inside the playhouse. “Evita’s my favourite musical and I’ve seen a number of productions,” said 37-year-old Rowena. “But this one’s really cleverly done: the staging’s very bare, no props or decoration really, but they do a lot with it.”Don’t cry for me, all you boozers! The trouble with shifting Evita’s big balcony number from stage to streetRead moreAround 9pm a stagehand emerged on to the balcony to unleash the long-armed camera that would capture the images projected to the audience inside. A dozenchorus members costumed in athleisure emerged on to the street and hush descended as their faces were dabbed by attendant make-up artists. “I’m actually not ready for this,” a young man whispered. “My heart is pounding.”A few moments later the song’s intro piped over the speakers – its familiar melody sung out by strings – and Zegler glided across to the centre of the balcony with a blond updo and huge diamond clusters glittering from her neck and ears. She looked out over the crowd tenderly, and a little searchingly, as if looking for connection, before beginning with those iconic lines: “It won’t be easy, you’ll think it strange …”It’s a famous song that’s been interpreted in different ways by stars from Patti Lupone to Madonna. Zegler’s voice has a clarity and innocence well suited to its frequently ingenuous lyrics. Her tiny Disney princess hands clasped the edge of the iron railing and there was even a Snow White smile. But you felt a sense of Eva Perón’s egoism and manipulation as the diva gestures – the regal wave, the arms to the sky – took over and Game of Thrones lovers may have found themselves having Daenerys Targaryen flashbacks.View image in fullscreenHundreds gather to watch the seven-minute song, which is livestreamed on to a screen for the audience in the theatrePhotograph: Ian West/PABy the end she was turning away from us to secure her closeup, proclaiming “Every word is true” even as flutes trilled laughingly in the background. The crowd’s whooping and applause became as much a part of the performance as the chorus’s accompanying hums. By the time Perón was spouting her Robin Hood lies about stealing from the oligarchs for the good of the people, Argyll Street was screaming its approval.The fact that the road remains open as a pedestrian thoroughfare during the performance added colour, with passersby approaching door staff to ask what on earth was going on. And the speed of dispersal when Zegler returned inside was theatrical magic: the street transformed from the Casa Rosada back to a grimy shortcut to the tube in a Cinderella instant.Nina, from Argentina, was one of the handful of ardent fans who stuck around a further hour to join the secondary crowd of autograph-hunters by the stage door after the show. She was impressed by Zegler’s pronunciation, and wished she could see the whole production. But all the cheap tickets for under-30s were sold out, and the rest were too expensive.Explore more on these topicsStageMusicalsLondon PalladiumCelebrityWest EndTheatreJamie LloydfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s brutal, cruel and, sadly, brings back the animal-mask wearing VIPs whose season one appearance caused global mockeryRhik SamadderSat 21 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareLook alive –Squid Gamereturns this week! There’s still no sign of any squid, which is the kind of false advertising that ruined The Pink Panther. But that’s good, because squid are terrifying. Once, showing off on holiday, I offered to cook for a group of friends. I didn’t speak the language where we were, and ended up leaving the fishmonger with a big bag of tentacles. As I attempted to remove the head, guts, beak and skin of the creatures, their internal sacs burst, coating me in viscous black ink. I suffered an allergic reaction, don’t eat squid any more, and don’t see those friends.Squid Game the TV show (Netflix, Friday 26 June) has proved even more traumatising. Set on a hidden island, the competition pits hundreds of desperate, indebted people against each other in a series of children’s games. The winner gets millions, while the losers are executed by guards, or die via gruesome, in-game accidents. The show’s brilliance is the way it amplifies the emotional stakes of each set-up. Players bond, form alliances, then have to murder each other to survive. The weak are ganged up on, cowards exploit loopholes in the rules to screw over everyone else, while those who make selfless choices are punished. Usually.It’s hard to discuss Squid Game without spoilering it to Buckaroo. It is such an enclosed world, a Jenga puzzle of individual choices and group consequence. This third, final series was intended to be part of the second, and filmed back to back. Which is to say, don’t drop in here if you haven’t seen the first two. It’ll still be upsetting, it just won’t make any sense.Let’s speak broadly of the characters, voluntary kidnappees on a starvation diet. The winner of the first Squid Game, who re-enteredthe secondto take revenge on its creators, is now dealing with the fallout of a failed insurrection. They spend much of their time chained to a bunk, looking more haunted than a Coney Island funfair. Their nemesis is the Front Man – an overseer who wears a voice-distorting mask and looks like Kryten fromRed Dwarfdipped in petrol. Other players include a drugged-up psychopath, whose simple pleasures involve watching the light fade in the eyes of the dying. There is also a mother and son, who probably won’t get to stay on the same team. Very upsetty, no spaghetti.Sadly, the VIPs also recur. Members of a wealthy elite, who created the tournament for their amusement. Wearing golden animal masks to make it crystal clear they are ciphers of decadence, they spectate from a neon pot-planted chamber, betting on who lives or dies. Imagine if the participants of Kubrick’sEyes Wide Shutran a board game night. These flimsy characters deliver dialogue so wooden it could have fallen off the back of a Jewson’s lorry. If our world has shown us anything, it is that the evil billionaires are not lazy, grape-eating emperors. They are narcissistic businessmen who get up at 4am to ruin the entire world, not just one small island.View image in fullscreenStuck in the middle … Lee Jung-jae as Seong Gi-hun in Squid Game season three.Photograph: ./NetflixI’m also less engaged by the storylines of organ-harvesting guards, or the ongoing efforts of detective Hwang Jun-ho to locate the island and find his missing brother. Squid Game is compelling because of its games. These diabolical tests plumb the depths of avarice and selfishness, or offer occasions for self-sacrifice and stoicism, depending how they’re played. “Do you still have faith in people?” is a question the overseer poses the hero, who stands on the precipice of an impossible choice. As characters, they embody opposite answers.Game theory, a branch of mathematics that analyses competitive strategies between rational actors, has proved that cooperation outperforms exploitation. In other words, it’s in all our interests to not be bastards. The problem is people are not rational; and having a gun to their heads tends not to help. Moreover, you know what a few rotten apples do to a barrel. This is why Squid Game grips us – we’re afraid of who we really are. We need to be shown ourselves, in the least flattering mirror, yet still be shown not all bad.What will the show’s verdict on us be? There is such cruelty in its premise, vivid glee in its sadism, and previous seasons have hardly ended on an upper. But the game’s not over till it’s over. Let’s see, through a squid darkly.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherSquid GameTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In this series, Serena tells her own story – though, of course, Venus chips in.

This weird but joyous documentary from Morgan Neville uses Lego to encapsulate the life of the wildly successful Neptunes producer and musician. Williams having synaesthesia – he experiences sound as colour – means the film can go off on visual flights of fancy; the beats he creates becoming rainbow fireworks or vibrant waves. All this trippy imagery covers up the fact that his rise to stardom has been fairly frictionless, but contributions from Lego versions of Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg et al attest to his offbeat worldview and hyperactive creativity.Simon WardellSaint Omer, 9pm, BBC FourView image in fullscreenA murky, moving courtroom drama … Saint Omer on BBC Four.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyWhy would a mother leave her 15-month-old daughter on a beach to drown?

Democrats need to know after their election drubbing by Donald Trump and the “manosphere” last year. They have responded by commissioning “Speaking with American Men”,a strategic planthat will study “the syntax, language and content that gains attention and virality” in online spaces.News of the two-year $20m project reinforced critics’ view that Democrats have become the party of an aloof, college-educated liberal elite whose pursuit of working class men resembles a Victorian explorer wielding a butterfly net. Which makes the publication of David Litt’s book,It’s Only Drowning, a timely contribution to Democrats’ ongoing post-mortem.Litt is a former senior speechwriter for Barack Obama dubbed “the comic muse for the president” for his work onWhite House Correspondents’ Association dinnermonologues. The 38-year-old has written speeches and jokes for athletes, chief executives and philanthropists and was head writer and producer in the Washington office of the comedy studio Funny or Die.It’s Only Drowning,his third book, centres on an improbable friendship that develops between Litt, a Yale-educated liberal with a fear of sharks, and his brother-in-law Matt Kappler, a tattooed truck-driving electrician who listens to podcaster Joe Rogan and never registered to vote.Their chasmic differences in background, education, ideology and lifestyle initially seem unbridgeable but, when Litt asks Kappler to help him learn how to surf, the shared experience provides neutral ground for connection.“What started as a surfing book became a story about basically a will-they won’t-they?, except it’s whether an Obama speechwriter and a Joe Rogan superfan can become friends,” Litt says in an interview at the Guardian’s office in Washington.“Like a lot ofDemocrats, my natural inclination is to be a little annoying and condescending. I certainly wasn’t doing that when I was the one who desperately needed to learn from him.”View image in fullscreenDavid Litt.Photograph: Lawrence JacksonLitt, who divides his time between Washington andAsbury Park, New Jersey, describes himself as a high-functioning, high-anxiety person who experienced situational depression during the coronavirus pandemic. He had a feeling of overwhelming dread, difficulty getting out of bed and found himself endlessly doomscrolling.His wife Jacqui’sbrother, by contrast, seemed to be thriving. Kappler is a guitar player, a motorcycle enthusiast and a daredevil surfer. Litt reflects: “I had always thought of him as a crazy person, and I still do, but he was able to deal with the ups and downs of life in a world that’s on fire in a way that I began to envy.“He did well during the pandemic and he seemed resilient in a way that, to be totally honest, I didn’t. I definitely was not about to get tattoos or try to drive a truck because I would bump into things, but I could see myself trying to surf and that’s what happened.”It would not be easy. At the age of 35, it required developing new muscles and confronting intense fear and humiliation. Still, Litt moved to the Jersey Shore and enlisted Kappler to help with surfing lessons. After months of struggle, he set the ambitious goal of riding a big wave in Hawaii.Surfing became a metaphor for confronting fear, both physical and existential, and an antidote to Litt’s habitual overthinking. He says: “Weirdly, the feeling I get, that sense of dread when a wave is about to crash down right on top of me, is actually somewhat analogous to the feeling I get when reading the news these days. It’s that sense of looming disaster and there’s nothing you can do about it.”And most importantly, Litt came to consider Kappler a friend. “One of the only things more difficult than learning to surf is making a new friend in your 30s, so I feel like I might be even more proud that I was able to accomplish that than riding an overhead wave on the North Shore.”As he tells this story, Litt reflects on America’s deep political and cultural divisions and how they were exacerbated by the pandemic. Differences in taste and lifestyle become “identifiers” declaring political allegiance. Litt admits that, had Kappler been a friend rather than family, he would probably have cut off contact after learning that Kappler refused the Covid shot.“He played electric guitar in a ska band that is a big deal on the Shore; I played ultimate frisbee. He was into death metal and I was into Stephen Sondheim. So we never had anything in common. In the run up to the pandemic all of these differences weren’t always political but then somehow they started to feel like they were telling us what team we were on. It felt like we’d been drafted into opposite sides of the culture war.”Litt does not pretend that there was a Hollywood ending in which he and Kappler found common ground and changed each other’s minds. But he does argue in favour of shared activities that allow for connection and understanding between individuals with differing views.“What we found was this neutral ground. Surfing is a space that is not politically coded and you can talk about something that isn’t one of the gazillion fault lines in our society right now. It’s hard to find those spaces but, for the exact same reason, it’s worth trying.Its Only Drowning.Photograph: Simon & Schuster“I heard from a lot of people in the run-up to this book coming out who said, ‘I have a friend or family member where politics is tearing us apart. We can’t talk about anything in the news and how do I convince them?’ What I would say now is talk about something else. Don’t talk about what’s in the news.“Start by looking for that neutral ground and forgetting about this idea of common ground, because the reason it feels like we have no common ground is that we don’t. We just disagree on a lot of important things as a society.”Litt knows that, had Kappler been registered to vote, he would certainly not have done so for Democratic nomineeKamala Harris. Back in 2016, Kappler said he would have backed either Trump or Bernie Sanders because they were the most entertaining.Litt says: “Truly the biggest divide between us politically is that I think about politics a lot and that’s part of how I define myself. Matt watches the news, he cares about what’s going on in the world, but that’s not his identity. He’s not a political person.“One of the problems that Democrats have right now is we’re very much the party of news junkies and most Americans are not news junkies.”Celebrity politics and cultural influence have moved towards Republicans and the likes of Rogan andElon Musk, who appeal to anti-establishment sentiment and claim to prioritise common sense over political parties. A new generation of rightwing podcasters and influencers started out as entertainers and latched on to issues later.“Democrats are still lagging.” Litt says. ‘The new media voices that are developing, many of them are great, but they tend to be political first and entertainment second, or politics as entertainment, and so they don’t appeal as much to people who don’t find politics entertaining and those are the voters we’re going to need in ‘28.”Democrats also have a well documented class problem. It has come to be seen by many as the party of Hollywood celebrities and college-educated elites, with a whiff of contempt for blue collar workers in the heartland, summed up by Hillary Clinton’s dismissal of half of Trump supporters as a “basket of deplorables.”The party’s perceived shift toward identity politics and social justice issues alienated some working class voters who once formed its base. Ahead of the 2016 election,Senator Chuck Schumer declared: “For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia.”It turned out to be bad maths. Last November Republicans swept the White House and both chambers of Congress. Trump won56% of voters without a college degree, compared with 42% who favoured Harris, a shift from 2020 when Trump and Joe Biden were roughly even.Litt points out the homogeneity of Democratic circles and the lack of organic relationships with working-class people, particularly those without college degrees. This disconnect hinders their ability to understand their issues or effectively communicate.Recalling his time volunteering for Harris’s ill-starred election campaign, he says: “I would sometimes be on conference calls and people would talk about a policy or message and say, ‘Do we think this is going to work? Do we think this is going to be effective?’ I would basically say, well, let me go surfing and find out.“Nobody else said, ‘Oh, let me go talk to my working class friend,’ because Democrats often do not have working friends who don’t have college degrees. The people who are in office, and the people who work for those who are in office, almost all are college educated and almost all their friends are college educated.“You have Democrats sit in rooms where literally everyone has a college degree, and they say, how come people without college degrees don’t feel like we’re thinking about them or that we’re welcoming to them? Well, look around the room.”Litt acknowledges that he is writing about a friendship with one other white man, the smallest possible sample size, making it hard to draw sociological conclusions about working class people of colour.But he also notes that Republicans have sought to “repolarise” the country on educational and culture war lines while making race less important in determining how people vote. Polls show that Trump did makebig inroads with Latino menand, to a lesser extent, with African American men.Litt says: “I don’t know that race stopped mattering but I do think there was a Democratic view that race mattered so much more than anything else, especially for people who are not white.“What we saw is very clearly no, that’s not true and was maybe not the most empirically based attitude to have. The base of the Democratic partyis still Black womenbut I do think there was some some of that racial depolarisation.”Democrats do have a strong policy agenda for blue collar workers but have failed to communicate it, Litt argues. His friendship with Kappler will not explain everything. But he offers it as a start for a party that somehow allowed Trump – a millionaire businessman who cuts taxes for the rich – to steal its clothes.“If you had asked me three years ago, do you have a lot to learn from your brother-in-law, I would have said not really, and one of the things I had to learn was that’s a deeply obnoxious attitude. I’m still a professional Democrat – I can still be plenty annoying – but I think I am less self-righteous than I used to be. And it turns out life is more fun and you’re more persuasive that way.

But the 90s romcom reminded me that I didn’t have to settle for anyoneAs told toKitty DrakeSat 21 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareWhen my boyfriend proposed, I said yes – not because I was madly in love with him, but because it seemed like the correct thing to do. We’d been together for eight years and all of our friends were getting engaged; my life felt like a constant cycle of hen nights. I knew something was wrong but I suppressed it. Sometimes I’d get these flashes of anxiety. I’d worry about the fact that I no longer felt excited when my boyfriend walked into a room, or that we didn’t have sex any more – but I was 28, which at that point felt ancient to me, and I was frightened of being alone. I told myself I was experiencing nothing more than a classic case of pre-wedding jitters. I threw myself into buying the big white dress and designing the invitations. I planned to stash a bottle of gin in the church, so I could have a shot to calm my nerves before I walked down the aisle.About three months before the wedding, I was home alone one evening and decided to watchSleepless in Seattle. It was my father’s favourite film – he loved the classic jazz soundtrack and Nora Ephron’s dialogue. It had been on in the background a lot during my childhood and teenage years, so I was expecting it to be a comfort watch; something to almost lull me to sleep. I’d remembered the film as being about a man (Tom Hanks) and his cute son grieving the death of his wife. But that night I interpreted the film completely differently. I was sucked into the perspective of Meg Ryan’s character, Annie, who is engaged to a perfectly decent but slightly boring man – and deciding whether or not to call it off. I’d always seen Sleepless in Seattle as being about bereavement, but that night on my sofa, it felt like a film about one woman’s decision whether to get married, and play it safe, or give it all up and take a leap.My wedding venue was booked, the deposit paid. But as the film went on I began to feel this overwhelming sadnessThere’s a scene towards the beginning where Annie is trying on a wedding dress at her family home. Her mother is talking about the “magic” she felt when she first laid eyes on her own husband, and Annie’s face just goes completely blank. You can tell she doesn’t feel anything close to “magic” with Walter, her fiance. Watching that scene, I felt the familiar squirm of panic, but I squashed it down. I did love my boyfriend, in a way. We trusted each other and were good friends and he cared for me. I told myself: I’m not going to be the person who has the magic, and I’m OK with that. I’m going to be the person who has a sensible, kind husband, and children, and a life that is beautifully mapped out.But as the film went on I began to feel this overwhelming sadness. My wedding venue was booked, the deposit was paid – but watching Annie agonise over whether or not to leave Walter, I began to realise that the way I was feeling about my own wedding couldn’t be ignored. Right at the end, Annie tells Walter about her doubts, and he has a line that illuminated everything for me: “I don’t want to be someone that anyone settles for.Marriageis hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn’t it?” I realised, listening to that, how selfish I was being. My boyfriend was good and generous. He didn’t deserve to be “settled” for. He didn’t deserve to have a wife who had to get drunk to force herself down the aisle.That night when he came home, I said I wanted to postpone the wedding. I wasn’t brave enough to outright ask to call it off, but he told me that if I didn’t want to marry him now, he didn’t want to be with me. I like to think perhaps he was having doubts too, but wasn’t able to voice them – I hope that’s true. I emailed all of our guests and told them that the wedding was cancelled, and people were generally supportive. I remember being so grateful that I didn’t have to “face” anyone. I could call the whole thing off while hiding behind a screen. I told my father thatSleepless in Seattlehad inspired me to make the decision, but I kept that part a secret from everyone else in my life. He understood, but I suspected other people would think I’d gone mad.I spent about 11 years being single after the breakup, so I definitely had to face my fear of being alone. Often it was hard, feeling like a spare part at my friends’ parties, but as I got older, being “coupled up” and safe lost some of its allure. I saw the cracks in the marriages around me, and I realised coupledom doesn’t actually insulate you from loneliness. I am married now, but I don’t completely buy into the idea that there has to be “magic” in a romantic partnership. I don’t believe in the Disneyland, mind-altering, life-completing version of romance – that part of Sleepless in Seattle just doesn’t ring true to me. But I still believe you should never settle for anyone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.We’ve asked design experts and home organisers for their best tips on how to hide it all, from furniture with charging drawers to hidden living room storage, cable clips and sleeves to an overlooked, hidden bathroom storage spot. And remember: storage baskets are your friend.A gif of a minimalist wooden kitchen. A wooden fronted dishwasher opens and closes, revealing lots of clutter spilling outPhotography: Ilka & FranzConceal cables with clips, sleeves and boxesRachel Burditt, home organiser atThe Declutter Darling, says clients often ask for help hiding the cables that dangle from lamps, speakers and TVs. Her solution? Using small cable clips (available from DIY stores such as Toolstation) to hold them in place on the back or side of the item. You just stick or nail the clip on to a hidden spot and feed the cable through it, keeping it out of sight. For cables that need to run along the floor, she recommends using cord sleeves – essentially jackets for your wires – that blend into your decor. She gets hers from Amazon, but you’ll find them in all DIY shops.In areas where multiple cables are needed, it might be worth investing in a cable box. They’re neutral containers you can sit a block of sockets in, keeping wires and plugs hidden and stopping them from gathering dust. Muji’s white, steel cable organiser looks like a desk tidy and fits into even the most minimalist aesthetic.“You can also get trays that attach under tables to keep wires tidy, which work well if you’ve got a home office,”Burditt says. Try Livivo’s under-desk cord organiser.View image in fullscreenAmazon cord sleeves£5.10 at AmazonView image in fullscreenMuji steel cable organiser£19.95 at MujiView image in fullscreenLivivo cord organiser£14.99 at B&Q£14.99 at AmazonCreate a ‘tech garage’The games consoles, tablets, laptops and phones that litter surfaces while they’re charging can also be hidden. Interior designerLoren Kreissrecommends creating a charging drawer in a bedside table or chest of drawers. Drill or cut a hole in the back. Put a block of sockets inside, run an extension cord through the hole and connect them to the nearest power outlet. Then leave your chargers in the drawer, ready to go.Interior designer Wesley Moon takes a similar approach with beauty devices: “I always build outlets into a drawer in vanity stations so things like hairdryers can stay plugged in.” This means they’re always tidied away. If you’re DIY-phobic, check out Wayfair, which has a range of cable management cabinets with holes pre-cut into the back. Try the stylish Holz Stainless Steel 2 with a ridged, moody black finish and a slot for wires at the back.View image in fullscreenHolz stainless steel 2 cabinet£125.99 at WayfairDiscover the magic of a small trolleyIf you don’t have an office and don’t want your home to look like a student library post-6pm on WFH days, an easy way to clear away your tech, stationery and paperwork is a must. Burditt recommends using a butcher’s trolley from Ikea, such as the Räskog – a stack of three baskets on wheels that you can fill with your work essentials and then stow away easily. “They’re really small [61 x 28 x 38cm]. Mine fits in my under-the-stairs cupboard.”They are also great for handbag collections, tool kits and more. Burditt recommends them for storing kids’ craft materials – allowing you to wheel the glue, glitter, felt tips, card etc out of sight after your little one has finished their masterpiece.Want a way to store the artworks they’re making? “Get one of the My Little Davinci picture frames,” says Imani Keal, DIY content creator at@imaniathome. “They allow you to store up to 50 sheets of paper, and you can display the nicest one on the outside.”View image in fullscreenIkeaRåskog£25 at IkeaView image in fullscreenMy Little Davinci multi-storage picture frames£29.99 at My Little Davinci£29.99 at AmazonTuck away air fryersin a hidden pantryBulky kitchen appliances such as air fryers and toasters take up valuable counter space. “If people have enough room, a walk-in pantry with a dedicated worktop is a great place to store appliances,” says Emma Perkin, director of Emil Eve Architects. “But of course, that’s not achievable for everyone.”For smaller kitchens, Perkin recommends adapting standard cupboards. “You can modify a tall, open-backed Ikea cabinet – for example, a Metod high cabinet – by adding a worktop-height work surface to one of the shelves and installing a plug socket. By removing or reducing the depth of the shelves above this (by either cutting them narrower or using shelves from thematching wall unit, which are only 360mmdeep), you can create space for your toaster and air fryer inside a cupboard, with shelves for spices, jars and bottles above.”View image in fullscreenMetod high cabinet£146 at IkeaStore kids’ toys in furniture“I don’t want plastic scattered everywhere, so I use hidden storage for toys,” says Burditt. She labels thin, flat storage bags – such as underbed grey storage bags from Dunelm – to keep puzzles, games and Lego under her sofa. “It’s all tucked away, but my kids know exactly where to find their things.”For larger items, she says an ottoman works well. “Just close it up, throw a blanket and some cushions over it, and suddenly it’s extra seating.” With a capacity of 117 litres, you could fit plenty of Lego in Swyft’s cushioned storage 02 bench, available in velvet, boucle or linen.Moon takes a similar, but built-in, approach. “In one New York apartment, we created a banquette along one wall. It worked as a dining nook, but the seat lifted up to reveal compartments underneath. Each child had their own section for toys, and we made sure the lids had spring mechanisms so they stayed open – no pinched fingers!”View image in fullscreenDunelm storage bags£5 at DunelmView image in fullscreenSwyft storage benchFrom £299 at SwyftFrom £340 at John Lewisskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

He used New York-basedArchitectural Grilleto make custom-designed sides, working with a carpenter on the frame. “We bolted it to the floor so its table surface didn’t wobble when the dog moved,” he says.Lots of furniture designers are selling similar dog crate furniture on Etsy. Tolotun dog house makes mid-century modern dog crates that look more like kooky 1970s display cabinets. Meanwhile,Kurr Pets’ dog and cat beds and houses, made of Baltic birch plywood and jewel- and pastel-tone fabric, would blend into a contemporary flat.View image in fullscreenFeandrea litter cabinet£50.99 at Songmics£78.39 at B&QView image in fullscreenTolotun dog houseFrom £279.56 at EtsyHide your gasmeter and boiler withshelvingBurditt has a simple idea for keeping an exposed gas meter concealed, which she used for a recent client. “We got a picture shelf and put that underneath it, and then got a few big prints to put in front of it.”Perkin says: “Hiding an ugly boiler inside a cupboard can make a massive difference. There are lots available specifically for this, or you could incorporate the boiler into a larger cupboard, perhaps with shelving around it for additional storage. She recommends Lark & Larks, who make tall cupboards specifically designed to conceal boilers, starting at £75.16. “You need to make sure you leave adequate space around and in front of the boiler for ventilation and access.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: brizmaker/Getty ImagesLark & Larks boiler cupboard£75.16 at Larks & LarksDiscover secret hiding spots in your bathroom“You know the panel on your bath? On some – usually the wooden ones – you can actually slide that out and use the space behind it,” says Burditt. If not, she recommends installing a Ceramica bath storage panel, which turns the space around your bath into a hidden cupboard with a sliding, lockable door. She says this is good for storing kids’ bathroom toys, spare beauty and cleaning products and loo rolls.Perkin says if you’re planning to renovate your bathroom and you’re getting a concealed cistern and wall-hung toilet installed, you have an opportunity to put in hidden storage. “You’re building out the wall anyway for the cistern to sit behind,” she says. “So you can get a carpenter to build in recessed shelves above the cistern, with mirrored doors flush with your new wall.”View image in fullscreenCeramica panel£119.99 at Plumb WorldKeepyourhallway paraphernalia under wrapsTryIkea’s Trones storage cabinet. “They are only 18cm deep and work in every single space,” says Keal. It looks like a clean white box, and was designed to store shoes, but she uses it to hide her wifi router, incoming post, her dog’s leash, food and toys. “And you can use the top of it to put a little basket or drop your keys on.”And for the shoe littering? Perkin says if you’re undergoing renovations and you have a generous living room next to the entrance hall, “you could look to borrow a bit of space from this to create recessed shoe and coat storage from the hallway.” Like Keal, she recommends fold-out racks for storing shoes away in narrow spaces. More than 10 pairs of shoes can be tucked away in the five-tiered steel Logan shoe rack fromSklum(£209.95). Wayfair also has a range of similar shoe tidies, such as the Sheringham six-pair storage with a wooden slatted finish.View image in fullscreenIkea Trones cabinet£25 for two at IkeaView image in fullscreenSheringham shoe storage£78.99 at WayfairAnd for everything else?View image in fullscreenWhether they’re wardrobes or kitchen units, Perkin recommends always building cupboards up to the ceiling. “We will often try to avoid any form of cupboards or wardrobes that stop below, because it creates a dust trap and you’re just wasting space that you could use.” While that space might be hard to get to, it’s a great place to store the things you only need every now and then – boxes of Christmas decorations, for example. You can do this by stacking two standard kitchen units on top of each other.“I always recommend getting a bed that’s at least eight to 12 inches off the ground,” says Keal, “so you can slide suitcases and other items under it.”DuskandLoafboth have great options with vast ottoman storage. “It’s the perfect space for things you don’t need access to all the time and want to keep out of sight.”Explore more on these topicsInteriorsThe FilterDIYHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Within a week of moving house, three years ago, I was dreaming of climbing plants: anything that could clothe the uninspiring domesticity of my new garden’s bare fences.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Three summers on, I have a good sense of which climbers thrust ahead and which take their time to get established; which spread thinly or densely; which annuals offer up a temporary, seasonal backdrop; which climb perfectly well unaided; and which benefit from a supportive frame. Here are 10 climbers I’ve enjoyed growing, and how to nurture them.The best climbing plantsWoodyclimbersOften slower-growing yet enduringly structural, woody climbers produce hardened stems that lignify in place. They include plants such as ceanothus, trumpet vine, wisteria, akebia and rose, many of which require the sturdy support of wire or trellis. Undoubtedly, woody plants demand more patience, but they can prove low-maintenance in the long term, and are easy to train and shape.HoneysuckleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: TonyBaggett/Getty ImagesFrom £7.99 at J Parker’s£11.69 at B&QA house-warming gift, one of the first climbers added to my garden was the cream yellow-flowered honeysuckle,Lonicera periclymenumGraham Thomas. A woodlander at home in low light, it was planted in the north-facing shade of our house, where its dark, glaucous-leaved stems clamber over horizontal wires, producing phenomenal, night-scented midsummer blooms visited by moths.Climbing hydrangeaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Elisabeth Schittenhelm/Getty Images£9.99 at Jacksons NurseriesFrom £11.24 at CrocusThis one will take time to get going, but few climbing plants are as rewarding asHydrangea petiolaris. Endlessly elegant with clusters of refined white, the deciduous petiolaris uses aerial roots to attach itself to surfaces, though wires can offer a leg up while it establishes itself. Growing happily in semi-shade, and relatively unfussy of soil preference, the only difficulty with this heavily set hydrangea is keeping it from bushing out from the wall or fence. To avoid this, prune outwardly extended stems back by a few buds right after summer flowering.Climbing roseView image in fullscreenPhotograph: GAP Photos/Jo Whitworth - Garden: David Austin Rose GardensThe Pilgrim£33 at BurfordView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Colin Underhill/AlamyMadame Alfred Carrière£21.59 at Carbeth plants£23.38 at B&QUnlike the often untamable “rambling” rose, climbers can be heavily micromanaged – so you can tie them into artful loops or swirls, which can become obsessive, trust me. The temptation with roses might be to direct the stems upwards for quicker results, but the key for maximum surface coverage is to get strong, long stems tied down horizontally, incrementally in succession up a wall or fence: horizontals promote more flowers and further vertical growth, which will add density at a surprising pace. Planted in full sun, favourites from my garden include bold-blooming, butter yellow the Pilgrim and fellow David Austin cultivar Mme Alfred Carrière, whose pink-tinged buds open a blushed, strongly scented white.Actinidia kolomiktaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: emer1940/Getty Images£19.95 at Gardening Express£24 at Ornamental TreesSurprisingly hardy given its somewhat precious appearance, this thickly foliaged kiwi relative bears curiously white and pink-tipped heart-shaped leaves. Once established in a sunny yet wind-sheltered spot and supported with wires, its woody stems will quickly advance and offer up a foliar blanket.The best pressure washers: eight expert picks for cleaning garden furniture and patiosRead morePerennial climbersWhile many climbing plants form a lasting framework, others can be cut down to regrow each year. These include some of the showiest varieties, whose well-established roots promote speedy, active growth each spring.Virginia creeperView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rosa María Fernández Rz/Getty ImagesFrom £3.99 at J Parker’sFrom £11.24 at CrocusBy far the most vigorous shady climber in my – or indeed any – garden, virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia) will attain heights by any means available. Often seen scrambling lamp-posts as it does woodland trees in its native Appalachia, this is one to keep in check, if necessary, by cutting back to a couple of feet each spring, once established. I got mine going on wires initially, however, it will self-adhere without fuss. Before shedding, its leaves blaze ochre through red across autumn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Cut down to 40-50cm from the ground in early spring and sending up energetic new shoots, this latter category includes popularviticella cultivarssuch as the blue-violet Perle d’Azur and the endearingly wild, lemony Clematis tangutica.How to get your garden ready for summer: 13 things you can do right now, according to the expertsRead moreCrimson glory vineView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Tim Gainey/Alamy£29.99 at Gardening ExpressAnother vigorous contender, the grape relativeVitis coignetiaecomes into its own in autumn, when its huge, lobed leaves become emboldened with dramatic hues of crimson, orange and plum. Grow on wires or up a tree in free-draining soil.AnnualclimbersIn my view, annuals are often overlooked as fence-covering climbers. This might be due to their impermanence – here for one season and gone the next – but this can also be their strength. They are very quick growing, can act as temporary fillers while woodier climbers are getting going, and very often produce excellent flowers and attractive, sometimes edible seed pods. Although typically grown on “teepees” or canes, by threading twigs (such as hazel or birch) through fence wires, they’ll have lots to cling to, encouraging quick growth.SweetpeaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: GAP Photos/Tim Gainey99p for 20 seeds at Thompson & MorganFrom £3.29 for 20 seeds at CrocusI’ll never tire of growing sweet peas – their fragrance is alluring and their range considerable, from showy mauves and maroons to subtle whites and greens. Easily germinated on a windowsill indoors, they can be planted out in spring sunshine and, owing to grappling tendrils, scale a fence by midsummer. Among the copious options, I particularly like growing the profuse cultivarsCedric Morris(plum-purple) and Painted Lady (pink-white).Cobaea scandensView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Tatiana Terekhina/Getty ImagesFrom £3.69 for 15 seeds at Crocus£3.79 for 15 seeds at Waitrose GardenCommonly known as the cup-and-saucer vine and hailing from Mexico, where its large bell-shaped flowers in purple and cream are pollinated by bats, cobaea is a stunning single-season addition. Climbing its way up with anchoring tendrils, it blooms in late summer for an extended period. Performs best from early sowings, however, small plants can be bought about now, saving the trouble of home germination.Runner beanView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Tom Meaker/Getty Images/iStockphoto£3.59 for 30 seeds at Thompson & Morgan£3.99 for 30 seeds at AmazonDespite the clear culinary associations, it is sometimes forgotten that runner beans were once cultivated as ornamentals, their vibrant scarlet, white and salmon flowers tumbling from twining vines. I say you can have both, and as anyone who has ever grown runner beans will attest, you can definitely have too many runners. Initially, deadhead the spent flowers before they can produce pods, and enjoy the rampant blooming before allowing them to fruit. Position in full sun if possible, and keep well watered.Matt Collins is a garden, nature and travel writer, and head gardener at the Garden Museum in LondonExplore more on these topicsGardensThe FilterGardening advicePlantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Add the bicarb and bring to a boil, then cook until completely soft (about an hour). Drain and reserve a ladleful of the cooking water (aquafaba), then transfer the beans to a blender.Add the olive oil, garlic, lemon juice and tahini, and blend for two to three minutes, until completely smooth. If slightly thick, add a splash of aquafaba. Check the seasoning; it should taste rich with a nice acidic lift from the lemon juice.

Add the diced tomatoes and salt, and cook until they break down. Add the vadouvan spice mix, the fresh broad beans and water, then cover with a lid and cook for about 30 minutes, until the beans are tender. Remove from the heat, add the lemon juice, then check the seasoning.For the crisped beans, heat the rapeseed oil in a pan until 180C, checking with a thermometer (if you don’t have one, add a cube of bread and when it sizzles, it’s ready). Carefully submerge the fava beans and fry until they stop bubbling and are crisp – a few minutes. Drain on kitchen roll and season with flaky salt.Spoon the fava bean dip on to a plate, making a well in the middle.

It was unusual behaviour from me, and more so because the sandwich in question was packed with an excessive amount of spring greens, but then, that is the genius ofBrooks Headley, chef/owner ofSuperiority Burger: like Midas, he has an ability to turn the ordinary into gold. Here, I’ve tried to recreate it by cooking down a kilo of spring greens until they are melting, soft, collapsed and buttery, before tossing them with sharp cheddar. It’s pure picnic gold.Spring greens and cheddar picnic focacciaYou don’thaveto have this on a picnic, but it really does work well, plus you can make the greens in advance and refrigerate them, provided you give them time to come up to room temperature afterwards. Buy the best focaccia you can find, or make your own – I makea 20cm x 30cm one like this(minus the garlic).Prep10 minCook30 minServes61kgbaby spring greens80g unsalted dairy butter4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil1 tsp fine sea salt100g mature cheddar, grated – I likeTicklerFocaccia, to serve (homemade or bought in)Wash the greens, shake off the excess water, then cut off the ends and compost them or save for soup – as a general guide, I cut away any stalks that are thicker than the base of my little finger. Shred the leaves into 3cm- to 4cm-wide strips.Put half the butter and half the oil in each of two large, deep frying pans and put them on a medium heat. When the butter has melted and started to foam, distribute the leaves and salt between the two pans and cook, stirring occasionally, for 25-30 minutes, until the greens have given up all hope of freshness and turned forest-black, glossy and soft. Tip all the leaves into one of the pans, toss through the grated cheese, then take off the heat.View image in fullscreenFind more than 6,000 recipes in the brilliant Feast app. Scan or clickherefor 30% off an annual subscription.Slice open the focaccia horizontally, then evenly pile the greens on the bottom half. Slap the lid on top and compress. If you like a bit of theatre, tightly wrap the focaccia in foil, pop it in a bread tin and pack with a large bread knife; once on location, turn out and slice with panache. Or, more sensibly, slice into portions before you leave and wrap individually.Explore more on these topicsSummer food and drinkMeera Sodha recipesVegetablesFoodBreadCheeseBakingItalian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

Shesaid recentlythat a lot of money was being put into cash savings accounts “when it could be invested in equities, in stock markets, and earn a better return”.The good news is that the rise of DIY tools and mobile apps means it is now easier than ever to get investing. However, the vast array of options can make it daunting to know where to start.For new investors who don’t have the time or confidence to manage a portfolio, “robo-advisers” can be a good option. They might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie but are basically online investment platforms that use technology to help automate the process. Most are app-based and typically offer a range of ready-made investment portfolios tailored to your individual preferences.You usually fill in a short questionnaire to determine your goals, how long you want to invest for, and how much risk you want to take.Typically, the longer you are investing for, the more risk you can afford to take. But you need to factor in your personal attitude to risk, too. Stocks and shares have historically delivered better returns than savings accounts, but there is also a chance you could lose money – and there will be ups and downs along the way – so you need to feel comfortable about this before taking the leap.The ready-made portfolios typically invest in a selection of exchange traded funds (ETFs). These are low-cost funds that track a chosen index such as a UK or US stock market, government bonds (such as UK gilts or US Treasury bills) or the price of a commodity such as gold.The apps put a selection of these funds together to create a balanced portfolio which spreads your money across different assets.So which of the apps – if any – is right for you? We looked at some of the most popular ones to see how they stack up.View image in fullscreenExchange traded funds (ETFs) track a chosen index such as the UK or US stock market, or government bonds.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersNutmegWho?One of the first robo-advisers to hit the market, Nutmeg launched in 2012, and in 2021 it was bought by the investment company JPMorgan Chase. It has more than 200,000 users in the UK, with more than £4.5bn invested through the app.Minimum investment:£500 forIsasand pensions, £100 for lifetime Isas and junior Isas.Investment choice:Nutmeg has different tiers of service, which will affect costs. With its fully managed option, you choose a risk level from one to 10, and a team monitors the portfolio and makes regular adjustments. With the fixed allocation option, there are five risk levels and the portfolio is set by the investment team once a year.Fees:Nutmeg says the total charge for the fully managed option is 0.98%. Someone investing £3,000 would pay about £29.40 a year. For fixed allocation, it is 0.65% – about £19.60 a year for that example.We like:Nutmeg is transparent about performance, and you can see how its fully managed portfolios have done over the past decade. For example, the 6/10 risk portfolio has returned 43.4% over 10 years, compared with 36.7% on average for comparable funds. The 5/10 portfolio is up 31.9% over that time, compared with 36.7% for its peers.Anything else?For those who want more support, Nutmeg offers free guidance to help with general questions, and full financial advice starting from £900.MoneyboxView image in fullscreenMoneybox is said to have more than 1.5 million customers.Photograph: mundissima/AlamyWho?Launched in 2016, Moneybox specialises in savings and investments and is reported to now have more than 1.5 million customers and in excess of £10bn of assets under management.Minimum investment:You can open an account with as little as £1.Investment choice:There are just three core options: cautious, balanced and adventurous. The cautious option has just 15% in company shares, with 40% in bonds and 40% in cash, which makes it less risky but means your returns may not be as impressive as with other options. The adventurous option has 80% in shares, 15% in property and 5% in bonds.Fees:A £1-a-month subscription fee covers trading costs. Then there’s a 0.45% platform fee, plus the cost of your actual investments – 0.17% for the core funds. Moneybox says someone with £3,000 invested in its balanced fund would pay total charges of 0.85% – about £25.60 a year.We like:The round-ups feature. Link your bank account or credit card to the app, and it will round your spending to the nearest pound and automatically invest the difference. For example, if you spent £1.87, it would be rounded to £2, with 13p invested – a handy way to boost your contributions.Anything else?Those who feel more confident can pick their own ETFs to invest in rather than the ready-made portfolios. Or, if you want to cherrypick specific companies, there is a limited range of stocks to select – though currently only US stocks are available.DodlWho?Dodl is the newest of this cohort, launched only in 2022, but it is owned by the wealth management giant AJ Bell, which has been around since 1995. Dodl offers a simpler process and lower minimum investment level than its parent company, and a more limited choice of investments.Minimum investment:£100, or set up a direct debit from £25 a month.Fees:0.15% a year, with a minimum of £1 a month, plus the cost of your investments – 0.31% for the core range. Someone with £3,000 invested would pay about £19.30 a year.Investment choice:The range of ready-made funds, run by AJ Bell, are labelled by risk level – from cautious to global growth. You can also choose individual shares, with the ability to browse by region (either the UK or US) and sector (such as finance, health or technology).We like:The option to invest by theme, which directs you to a relevant ETF for your trend of choice. For example, the “On top of the world” theme invests in the HSBC FTSE All-World, an index of some of the biggest companies around the globe, which charges 0.13%. Other options include “the home team” for UK-focused investments, and “robo revolution” for a fund investing in robotics companies.Anything else?It pays a competitive 4.25% (variable) on cash you have not yet invested.View image in fullscreenDodl’s ‘robo revolution’ fund invests in robotics companies.Photograph: Costfoto/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockWealthifyWho?Founded in 2014, Wealthify is now owned by the insurance giant Aviva and has about 100,000 customers. It has a big focus on keeping things simple and jargon-free.Minimum investment:Currently £1 for Isas and £50 for pensions, though from Wednesday 25 June the minimums will be £1 for junior Isas, and £500 for stocks and shares Isas and pensions.Investment choice:There are five risk levels: cautious, tentative, confident, ambitious and adventurous. The cautious portfolio has 85% of its assets in government bonds and just 5% in company shares. The adventurous option has 74% in shares and 14% in government bonds, and also invests in property and infrastructure.Fees:The platform fee is 0.6%, which includes the cost of managing your portfolio. The cost of your investment on top is 0.16% for a general portfolio, and 0.7% for the ethical option. That adds up to £22.80 a year, or £39 for the ethical option, for someone with £3,000 invested. There is no minimum fee.We like:Its outlook page, which offers a short overview of the prospects for different investment regions and assets. It’s a handy way for investors to learn a bit more without hours of research.Anything else?Wealthify boasts of various customer service awards on its website – a good reminder to consider factors aside from fees and the investment range. Always be sure to do your own research and read independent reviews before choosing a provider.MoneyfarmWho?Moneyfarm originated in Italy and launched in the UK in 2016. It now has about 160,000 active users and more than £5bn in assets under management. The firm has backing from big investment groups such as M&G and Allianz.Minimum investment:£500.Investment choice:There are seven risk levels for its managed funds, which are regularly rebalanced by the investment team. For example, the 6/7 risk option has 72% of its assets in developed market companies and 10% in emerging markets companies, while the 2/7 risk option invests predominantly in bonds.Fees:Someone with £3,000 in the actively managed option would pay management fees of 0.75%, plus 0.3% for their investments – equivalent to about £31.56 a year. For the fixed allocation options, which are adjusted just once a year, the management fee is 0.45% plus 0.17% for the investments – a total of 0.62%, or about £18.60 a year for that example.We like:It is easy to see a breakdown of each portfolio on the website to understand how it is invested. You can see how it invests by asset type, region and sector – and there’s a simple explanation of each, too.Anything else?As with most of these apps, there is an option to apply environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria to your investments, which is good for any investor worried about where their money is going. This will screen out certain investments – for example, heavy polluters or companies with a poor human rights record. Selecting this option typically increases the costs.View image in fullscreenSome ETFs (exchange traded funds) track the price of a commodity such as gold.Photograph: Leonhard Föger/ReutersNeed to knowBefore choosing a robo-advice app or service, make sure the company is regulated by UK watchdog theFinancial Conduct Authority(FCA).It should also be a member of theFinancial Services Compensation Scheme(FSCS), the UK’s official consumer “lifeboat” scheme which protects up to £85,000 of your money if your provider collapses.Most apps offer a variety of accounts, but a stocks and shares Isa is usually the best choice. You can put up to £20,000 a year into an Isa, and any interest or growth is sheltered from HMRC, meaning you get to keep all of your gains.When it comes to fees, you are usually charged a percentage of the amount you invest – for example, if you invested £1,000 and the fee was 1%, you would pay £10 a year. However, sometimes there is a minimum charge, so check carefully what you would pay.Explore more on these topicsInvestmentsInvestment fundsSharesBondsSavingsIsasConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

According tola Repubblica, his absence comes after a brief stint in hospital.Speaking to the Guardian in January, the man known in Italy as “Re Giorgio” (King George), said that “age is undoubtedly a factor to contend with”. While he would “continue as long as my health and energy permit”, he also said that “taking a step back in the near future [was] inevitable”.Last year, the designer toldthe Corriere della Sera newspaper he planned to retire in the next few years regardless, but that the Armani brand would continue without him. In his first live show after the pandemic in 2021, Armanishowed a scarfrom surgery to his arm that resulted from a fall during a visit to the cinema.In the current fashion landscape, which is dominated by conglomerates such as LVMH and Kering, Armani is one of the few designers to remain the sole shareholder of his company while also overseeing every single collection produced in its 50-year history. Arecent valuation by Forbessuggested the Armani group was worth £10bn.Giorgio Armani strives for harmony in Milan amid global tumultRead moreThe designer, who turns 91 next month, is widely credited with transforming stiff suiting for men, getting women into menswear and bringing Italian style to Hollywood. It is thought he is missing this weekend’s shows as a precautionary measure so he is able to attend the couture – or Privé – show next month in Paris.One of the Milanese’s key contributions to high fashion has been his invention – and reinvention – of celebrity dressing, with Hollywood’s bold and beautiful, including Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett and Angelina Jolie, all wearing his couture gowns on the red carpet.Taking the requisite designer bow at the end of Saturday’s Emporio Armani show and Monday’s Giorgio Armani show will be Leo Dell’Orco, his collaborator and head of menswear design. The statement also confirmed that Armani had worked “with his usual dedication” on both collections, and that he planned to watch the shows.As yet, there is no obvious heir to the Armani throne.Explore more on these topicsArmaniMilan fashion weeknewsShareReuse this content"

She was talking about champagne – but could equally have been talking about her popular basket, which is now arguably the accessory of the summer.“It’s such a weird story, because as a useful bag it doesn’t really function,” says fashion historian Tony Glenville. The then CEO of Hermès, Jean-Louis Dumas, apparently watched as the contents of one of Birkin’s baskets spilled out on an Air France flight to London in 1984. The bag’s obvious design flaws – no zips or pockets – inspired Dumas to create theleather Birkin handbag.Design flaws aside, the high street is awash with baskets: Next, New Look, Mango and M&S are all offering cut-price versions. Luxury fashion has hopped on the wicker wagon, too, the most sought-after version said to be by the Spanish luxury brand Loewe. In the last three months alone, searches for Loewe’s raffia bags have increased by 1600% on Net-a-Porter.View image in fullscreenLoewe’s raffia bags are said to be the most sought-after luxury-brand baskets.Photograph: Loewe“It’s like a trend that’s never gone out of fashion,” says Sarah Corbett-Winder, a fashion stylist who owns “embarrassingly, at least 40” basket bags. “It’s got the route to Jane Birkin, and I think that just makes it sort of ‘forever’ … She’s just so iconic.”For Glenville, it’s about what these bags signal. “They say: ‘I’m a bit creative, I also like a picnic, and I’ve just grabbed this delicious straw bag from the hall table in my country house, or chateau.’” As such, he says, “they should ideally hold a sketching kit, some dog biscuits and a jar of homemade preserve”.Corbett-Winder also thinks that “probably subconsciously there is a connection to that sort of era and that time; it was just very carefree”, as well as “that French girliness that we all love massively”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Basketmaking has since declined in the south of France, however.Photograph: Jean Jacques Levy/APWhile the leather Birkin is one of the world’s most expensive bags, the basket can be one of the most affordable.It also helps that there are many different styles. The market shopper – roomy, and usually with leather straps – is the most commonly spotted, and probably the most practical. Birkin herself largely went for a rigid, almost egg-shaped fisher’s wicker basket.Although the bags are associated with the south ofFrance, there are very few basketmakers there nowadays. According to a representative of the Terre d’Argence tourist agency, “it is not a very lucrative job”. In the commune of Vallabrègues, where there is a basketry museum, “in the beginning of the 20th century, one could count up to 400 basketmakers in the village. Nowadays there is only one remaining,” they said.We can expect to see baskets continue to flourish, as they are the epitome of summer. But will we ever see them out of the house in the colder months? Glenville thinks not. “One would never use them after September or before Easter,” he says.But Corbett-Winder has tried. “They do still, I feel, work – but not as well,” she says.Explore more on these topicsFashionJane BirkinRetail industryFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are also a good excuse to meet up  with family and friends for a party in the forestJohnny GreenSat 21 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareTowards dusk a bonfire was lit and, one after another, the friends we were eating and drinking with hurdled the leaping flames, a pagan ritual thought to provide benefits including improved physical and mental strength, prosperity and fertility.Further heat came from a sauna we made using five sacks of logs – too many, we agreed afterwards. When it got too hot, we escaped into the cool shallows of the pond just a few metres away, repeating this cycle several times.View image in fullscreenAs we soak up the long, light days of summer, I’m reminded of this magical time I spent in Lithuania celebrating the summer solstice, or Joninės as it’s called there. A suitable translation is Saint John’s festival, a public holiday celebrated each year on 23 and 24 June. The name pays homage to John the Baptist and coincides with his feast day, yet the traditions of Joninės are deeply rooted in the pagan celebration of midsummer, predating Christianity.View image in fullscreenSwimming in a pond near Čiobiškis, during midsummer solstice.Photograph: Johnny GreenSimilar pagan festivals take place in the Baltic nations of Estonia and Latvia, known as Jaanipäev and Jāņi,respectively. It’s a time when people travel from the city to gather in the countryside to eat, drink, sing and observe ancient folk traditions relating to fertility, harvest and renewal.I travelled by train from Tallinn to Riga, and on to Kaunas, Lithuania’s second-largest city, to meet my girlfriend, Jūratė. From there, it’s a further 50 miles east to just outside Čiobiškis, where we meet Jūratė’s extended family – about 80 of them, from newly borns to octogenarians, of which Julė is the elder and true matriarch presiding over the Joninės celebrations.A short drive through the forest brings us to what resembles a bespoke and bijou festival, laden with copious amount of food and drinkThe journey from Čiobiškis to the surrounding countryside requires us to take the smallPadaliai-Čiobiškis ferryacross the Neris river – travel at its most rustic and serene. This is followed by a short drive through a forest, which brings us to what resembles a bespoke and bijou festival, with family members having travelled from across Lithuania and beyond, all of us laden with copious amounts of food and drink for the two-day celebration.It’s beautiful countryside – fairly flat and wooded, full of waterways providing an abundance of blue mixed with the verdant hues of surrounding vegetation, and punctuated with bright, colourful splashes from the many species of wildflower, such as lupin, cornflower, chicory, yarrow and buttercup.We watch the Neris meandering downstream to the right, and two fishermen, Julius and Česiukas, attempting to catch a trout, perch, bream or perhaps salmon for the table. Meanwhile, Jūratė and her friend Eglė collect small posies of wild flowers to weave into flower crowns, symbols of love and fertility, while I rest on the riverbank enjoying this bucolic scene.View image in fullscreenA summery sunset in Kaunas.Photograph: Airimas Vasiliunas/Getty ImagesAt the centre of the celebrations, beneath a huge structure created from local timber, tables have been joined together to form one great community banquet, flanked by benches on either side. It’s here I taste the intriguing-lookingšakotisfor the first time – a layered cake resembling a tree, made of butter, eggs, flour, sugar and cream, and cooked on a spit. Its jagged spikes look almost too sharp and angular to eat, but it’s delicious.Dishes brought by Jūratė’s family include salted herring, chanterelles spread on rye bread, a beef and vegetable stew which is very much to my liking, and a boiled tongue wrapped in smoked pig’s ear, which is less so.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My favourite isbalandėliai, cabbage leaves filled again with pork mince and served with potatoes. It’s hearty fare for the longest day of the year, washed down with the exquisite cherry liqueurŽagarės.As another bonfire is lit, everyone gathers around the campfire to tell stories and sing traditional folk songs. It is believed that the brighter the flames, the more abundant the harvest will be. Beer, oralus, is in plentiful supply, but the more pagan among us opt for homemadesidras(cider) or the stronger stillsamanė(moonshine) all of which helps make camping a little more comfortable.A further ritual begins from midnight: the search forpapartis, a fern that, legend has it, produces a magic white flower on midsummer eve. Couples wander into the forest to hunt for this mythical bloom, discovering, perhaps, far more besides. I’m told the most common date that babies are born is 25 March, some nine months later on Gandrinės or Stork Day – with the arrival of the country’s national bird signifying the beginning of spring as they return from their winter migration.Yet another name for summer solstice is Rasos, or Dew festival, since it is believed that dew collected on the morning of midsummer is especially potent for fertility, while wild herbs gathered on the night of Joninėsare believed to possess magical and healing properties, since this is when nature is at its most powerful.View image in fullscreenJūratė (right) and her cousin Simona (left) wear flower crowns on family land outside Čiobiškis in Vilnius county.Photograph: Johnny GreenWhile paying our own dues to some of the ancient traditions, we also do things our own way, combining music from the radio station LRT Opus with further consumption ofalusand Žagarės.I’m sure every family and group of friends celebrate differently, but all that really matters is being together, in nature, with skylarks visible high above and cuckoos audible in the woods.The magnificence of Joninės was captured by the Lithuanian poet and philosopher Vydūnas, who described it as the “feast of the bonfire light meeting the all-encompassing sunlight”. As we make our way a few miles south to the hamlet of Mikalaučiškės for a gathering with some of Jūratė’s friends – since Joninės is very much about celebrating with friends as well as bloodlines – I think of those words written by Vydūnas a century ago. Today’s bonfire is already burning bright amid an everlasting twilight of deep orange, pink and blue, painted above the horizon.Baltic Gentlyorganises various Joninės packages across Lithuania, from €75 to €130Explore more on these topicsLithuania holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the time I was experiencing a degree of sloth I decided to dress up as indignation: I emailed back saying I knew nothing of so-called bin shoes, that I had one pair of stout boots that served me in all circumstances.This was more or less true – I’m on my sixth pair of identical pull-on ankle boots, which suit both formal and informal occasions, and all seasons. I wear them on long hikes, even though I probably shouldn’t, and I slip them on late at night, without socks, when I have forgotten to put out the bins.Of course I do own other shoes, including some classic branded trainers that were deeply fashionable when I was nine, but which my mother would not buy me, presenting me instead with suspect lookalikes.“They’re supposed to have three stripes,” I said. “These have four.”“A bonus stripe,” my mother said.“These are bobos,” I said, using my peer group’s common slang for cheap knock-off trainers.“What’s the difference?” she said.The difference, I explained, was that when I went to school in them the other children would gather round me and sing “Bobos, they make your feet feel fine/Bobos, they cost a dollar ninety-nine…” to the tune of the Colonel Bogey March. My mother thought this was hilarious.When I go to leave the house I find a single pair of black boots by the front door: one size 8½, the other a 10Anyway, last autumn my middle son let it be known that his work shoes had worn out, and that he was seeking an all-purpose footwear solution.“What about Dad’s boots?” my wife said. The middle one leaned over the kitchen table to examine my feet.“They’re very versatile,” I said.“Yeah, maybe,” he said, frowning a little.“I’ve worn these babies to funerals,” I said. “And I’ve worn them to the beach.”In spite of his reservations, my wife bought him a pair. He was so pleased with them that she gave our other two sons a pair each for Christmas. For a short period I considered myself an intergenerational influencer, before the trouble started.The first time it happens I’m on my way to the shops when I notice something disquieting about my gait. I feel graceless, rackety and slow. It’s just age, I tell myself, but I’m still out of sorts when I reach the front door, where I am greeted by the middle one standing in his socks.“Are you wearing my boots?” he says.“No,” I say looking down.“Yes, you are,” he says, “and I need to go to Birmingham.”“Wow, they really are identical,” I say. “Actually I did notice something weird when I …”“Take them off,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But evidently he has. Coincidentally, the day before my classic branded trainers had split a seam, so the toe of the right one hung open, slack-jawed. I can’t wear those, I think. Nor can I wear two boots of markedly different sizes, even though my son apparently can.Upstairs in my cupboard I find a pair of Slovakian canvas sneakers my wife once bought me. There is, I think, nothing else for it.As we sit in the recording studio listening to the drummer add extra cymbal crashes to a track, the guitar player turns and looks me over.“This is a new style for you, isn’t it?” he says. I look down at myself. I have on a densely patterned half-sleeved shirt I found in my holiday luggage, and shoes that might accurately be described as bobos.“You appear to think of me as someone who doesn’t have summer looks,” I say, “but I have summer looks.”“I wasn’t criticising,” he says.“I’ve got lightweight knits,” I say. “I’ve got structured linens. ”My phone pings – my oldest son’s reply to my recent text. “I’m wearing trainers,” he writes. “All the boots are in the house.”As I look down at my feet an ancient tune threads through my head: “Bobos, they’re made for hoboes, so get your bobos for hoboes today.”Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lowestoft’s more visible gull problem, however, is its kittiwakes, another gull species whose population has grown from a single breeding pair in the 1950s to more than 1,000 nests today, splodged messily on to window sills, architraves and shopfronts throughout the town centre and leaving anyone passing underneath at risk of a foul-smelling guano splat.View image in fullscreenLowestoft’s lifeboatman statue.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianAnd this is not just a problem for Lowestoft.All over Britain, and coastal areas in Europe and the US, communities are in a flap about seagulls.North Yorkshire council is developing what it calls agull management strategyin response to increasing complaints of “gull mugging attacks” in towns from Scarborough to Whitby. InLyme Regis, Dorset, authorities have introduced a public space protection order (PSPO) banning the feeding of birds to deter swooping herring gulls, having also tried flying drones and birds of prey to scare them away.The Highland council recently conducteda census of the birdsto feed into its own management plans as herring gull numbers in Inverness and elsewhere soar. It is illegal, otherwise, to harm or capture any wild bird or interfere with its nest. Nevertheless, in March the former Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross,called on the Scottish parliamentto give people licenses to kill gulls, mentioning other Scottish councils that had spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on the problem “to no effect”. Put to a newspaper poll,two-thirds agreed.View image in fullscreenA gull at Lowestoft’s habourside.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianIf it can seem at times that seagulls are taking over British towns, the fact is that their numbers aren’t rising at all – they are falling sharply. “Seagulls”, in fact, don’t really exist – the term is a catchall for 50 species of gull worldwide, six of which are commonly found in the UK.Of these, both the kittiwake and herring gull are “red listed”, meaning their breeding populations have experienced perilous drops in recent decades; while other species including the great and lesser black-backed gulls and the (now misnamed) common gull are on the amber list, meaning moderate but still concerning decline.In some traditional coastal nesting sites, the most recent national seabird census found, the populations haveall but collapsed. South Walney nature reserve in Cumbria had more than 10,000 herring gulls’ nests in 1999 and just 444 in 2020, a drop of 96%, according to Dr Viola Ross-Smith, agull expertat the British Trust for Ornithology. The crash in numbers of lesser black-backed gulls at the same site was even greater, at 98%.Why? Alongside the wider biodiversity crisis, say experts, it’s partly because Britain’s gulls are moving into town.View image in fullscreenLowestoft’s gull population has risen to an estimated 10,000 herring gulls, plus more than 1,000 kittiwake nests.Photograph: Ali Smith/The Guardian“When we talk about urban gulls, not only in coastal communities or towns but also increasingly in large urban centres, it’s about recognising that these birds are moving,” saysHelen F Wilson, a professor of geography at Durham university whose work focuses on the social and cultural geography of humans and other species sharing the same space. “It’s not that they’re increasing in number, but they are shifting away from where we might have expected to see them.”There are lots of possible reasons for that she says – warming seas, falls in their prey species, changing in fishing practices, more violent winter storms. Rather than seeing gulls as malign dive-bombers that are after our chips, in other words, we ought perhaps to consider their vulnerability. “We need to think about what [their growth in towns and cities] tells us about what is happening elsewhere,” she says. “Because for whatever reason, these birds are now finding urban environments much better than the coast.”View image in fullscreenGulls Albert and Alberta have arrived for opening time at Lowestoft’s On a Roll food stall for the past three years.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianThey are also just carrying out their natural behaviour. “We often describe herring gulls in very sinister ways: they’re cool, calculating, muggers, cannibalistic – these very moral ways of talking about them. But what we’re actually describing is natural behaviour, whether that’s protecting a nest or simply feeding. Herring gulls snatch food from other birds in the wild, so it stands to reason that they would take things from people’s hands.”Ross-Smith agrees. Herring gulls, for instance, can be especially aggressive – she prefers “aggressively defensive” – while their chicks are fledging, “but I wish people understood that the gull is merely being a very protective parent”.“We are part of an ecosystem, and we’re in a biodiversity crisis, and I think we need to be a bit more tolerant of the other species around us,” she says.View image in fullscreenHerring gulls can be ‘aggressively defensive’.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianAs well as big environmental stresses, each town has specific local factors that may have encouraged gulls to settle. In Inverness, for example, the closure of a nearby landfill site in 2005 was one of the drivers of a very sharp increase in the city centre, according to David Haas, a senior community development manager for the Highland council. Having previously reduced the number of nests by physically removing eggs (under license), they have now moved to a range of non-lethal deterrents including the use of lasers, sonar and hawks.“As we changed over to these methods, it’s caused a lot of angst amongst people, understandably,” says Hass. They are also mindful that birds shooed from the town centre may simply move to the suburbs, “and we have had evidence of that, where they’re going into residential areas and causing a bit of mayhem in certain spots. But we’re addressing that too. It’s work in progress.”View image in fullscreenDick Houghton, a member of Lowestoft Seagull Action Group.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianSimilarly, the initial migration of Lowestoft’s kittiwakes from its docks to its main shopping street and beyond followed the demolition of a derelict structure on which a small number of pairs were happily nesting. Finding town centre ledges even more to their liking than the cliff sides where they naturally roost, their numbers had reached 430 nests by 2018, then 650 in 2021, and more than 1,000 today, according to Dick Houghton, a retired fisheries scientist who now unofficially monitors the birds. “And there are thousands of sites in the town where they could nest,” he says.Steam-cleaning kittiwake dung – a pungent brew, given the birds’ diet of sand eels and herring sprat – from the pavement below Lowestoft’s nesting sites is now a daily task, costing East Suffolk council £50,000 a year, according to Kerry Blair, the council’s strategic director. “That’s difficult to sustain in the current financial environment, but we can’t not do it,” he says.Lowestoft, too, has experimented with nest removal and egg oiling (which stops them developing) in the past, “but we’ve come a long way in terms of understanding our responsibilities”, says Blair. That’s included learning about the birds themselves, he says. Unlike other gulls, kittiwakes don’t snatch food, and spend their winters out to sea in the North Atlantic, allowing old nests to be removed each winter. But they also like to nest in the same spot each year. So if they can’t access that spot next year, it doesn’t mean they’ll fly back out to sea – they’ll simply move to the next available windowsill along.View image in fullscreenPurpose-built nesting ledges for kittiwakes in Lowestoft.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianIt has led to the recognition that the birds aren’t going anywhere, so people will have to learn new ways of living with them, says Blair. Rather than merely ousting the birds from their facades, for instance, building owners are now encouraged to build bespoke nesting ledges for them on more discreet walls away from public footpaths. A row of simple wooden ledges drilled to the side of a BT building now houses as many as 120 kittiwake nests, leaving the public space free of their mess.“That’s the journey that the council has been on,” says Blair. “The Lowestoft kittiwake, when we started to look at [the issue], was about the dirt on the pavement, but it’s turned into something else … It’s about trying to see it as an amazing gift, really, to have these very endearing creatures living among us. Yes, it brings a few problems. Let’s deal with all those problems and learn to love them living alongside us. That’s a journey, I think, and more people than you’d expect in this town are starting to feel the same.”This article was amended on 21 June 2025 to refer to East Suffolk council, not East Sussex council."

A 4-mile hop to central London makes for an easy journey to work, especially for one kind of commuter: cyclists.On the morning we visit Clapham High Street, at the height of rush hour, their presence is immediate.In every direction bikes are weaving through traffic, filtering through busy roads in stops and starts. Drivers shout, horns blare and cars cut across each other. Adding to the sense of chaos are pedestrians who step off pavements without looking up from their phones. Near misses are common.At a junction with traffic lights, cyclists, many of them ebike riders with no helmets, zoom through the red lights as if they’re not there. Some swerve in and out of bike lanes; one speeds up the wrong side of the road, narrowly avoiding a bus.Video showing cyclists having near misses with other trafficFootage of traffic at an intersection near the worst junction in Great Britain for accidents involving cyclistsIf the scene looks dangerous, statistics on collisions involving bikes suggest it is. This is the stretch of road in Great Britain where the most accidents involving cyclists have happened since 2020.We visited the street as part of a Guardian investigation into the safety of roads inEngland, Wales and Scotland. From 2020-23, there were 23 accidents involving cyclists reported to emergency services at the junction where Clapham High Street meets Gauden Road and Lendal Terrace.One pedestrian on the high street said crossing the road had become increasingly frightening because cyclists ran red lights, particularly since the arrival of ebikes. “Cyclists put the fear of death into pedestrians now. They jump lights, they go on the pavement, they go counter to the traffic. It’s awful,” she said.On the day we visit the high street there are more law-abiding cyclists than those running red lights or cutting in front of cars. But during the observation period at a controlled intersection just north of the High-Gauden-Lendal junction, a bike could be seen hurtling through a red light once every 90 seconds on average.Simon Munk, the head of campaigns and community development atLondon Cycling Campaign, said junctions could be particularly risky for cyclists even where there were cycle lanes, as there are at the Clapham junction.“A hugely high proportion of serious and fatal collisions happen at junctions for people cycling and so junctions are the spot where danger is at its most intense.”Road design also played a big part. “Some junctions are almost designed in a way that creates conflict by introducing too many traffic movements across the cycle lanes,” he said. This meant any benefits of the designated lanes “completely disappear”.Kyle Linch, a chef in Mayfair, said he regularly saw cycling accidents around Clapham. “I saw one girl fall off her Lime [bike] yesterday. These two cars came out of nowhere,” he said. “The traffic’s always mental so it’s not that surprising. I definitely wouldn’t say it’s safe.”The popularity of ebikes undoubtedly contributes to the congestion on the road on the morning of our visit. The dockless bicycles whizz around in all directions, irking even other cyclists.One commuter riding their own bike said: “There’s a lot of cycle lanes and I think drivers are quite cautious.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ebikes seem to be the worst – running red lights, no helmets – and perhaps that’s because most of the people who ride them have less experience.”For campaigners who want to encourage people to take up cycling, the focus on accident data and dangerous riding is unhelpful. Duncan Dollimore, the head of campaigns atCyclingUK, a charitable membership organisation, said the statistics did not capture the experience of cycling.“Cycling is not an unsafe activity, in fact it’s statistically safe,” said Dollimore. “But that’s not how it feels to many people.”Making the roads safer for cyclists would help to overcome that perception, he said. “The more protection and coherence and separation of infrastructure there is, the more people are likely to cycle, and do so safely.”For the Clapham High Street commuters, good news may be at hand. Helen Cansick, Transport for London’s head of healthy streets investment, said changes were planned for this summer.“We are committed to making changes across the capital so that people can travel safely, whatever mode of transport they choose,” she said.A spokesperson for Lime said the rental company supported the TfL and London councils’ investment in cycling infrastructure. “Cyclists running red lights not only endanger themselves and others, but also undermine public confidence in cycling as a safe, sustainable mode of transport,” they said.“Through regular rider communications, training programmes and penalties for dangerous behaviour, we work to educate riders and encourage safer cycling on our roads.”This article was amended on 21 June 2025 to refer to Lendal Terrace rather than “Lenden Terrace”, and to clarify that some observations, including video footage, were made at an intersection near the worst junction for cycling accidents, as well as at the worst junction itself.Explore more on these topicsCyclingLondonEnglandRoad transportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My first call of course is to my local police station,” he said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“The police reluctantly tell me they have no legislative power to move these people on, which I find incredibly disappointing. The vagrancy act is no longer applicable and unless there is demonstrable public disturbance the police, I am told, cannot move them on.

Councils in the Gold Coast,Moreton Bay and Brisbanehave carried out a campaign of clearing the camps in recent months.Council rangers don’t have the same powers of detention as arrest, though they can levy a fine and can remove property such as tents from public land. Police typically accompany them during homeless camp clearances butonly as a supporting element.A University of Queensland law professor, Tamara Walsh – who has long studied laws criminalising homelessness – said police can still charge people with public nuisance offences.But they tend not to because doing so is extremely expensive to the taxpayer, due to the cost of putting an offender through court and jail.“If people are living in poverty and unhoused, then that is a housing issue. It’s a social welfare issue, it’s not a criminal law issue,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It concluded the pipeline did not need a national environmental impact statement before going ahead.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterAPA Group, an energy infrastructure business, plans to build the 37km pipeline to connect a fracking operation in the NT’s Beetaloo gas basin with the existing Amadeus pipeline. About 134 hectares of vegetation – equivalent to about 18 football grounds – would be cleared in the NT outback, about 600km south of Darwin. The new pipelineis expected to operate for 40 years.The environment department said that the construction would clear “high -quality habitat” for the critically endangered northern blue-tongued skink, including about 29 hectares that was “likely critical for the survival of the species”.But it decided the pipeline route did “not form part of the species’ area of occupancy” and concern about the skink was not grounds to fully assess the development.Collins’ delegate disagreed. They said the pipeline should be fully assessed due to its potential impact on threatened species habitat and the assessment should consider “cumulative impacts” – that is, that the pipeline and the Shenandoah pilot fracking project developed by Tamboran Resources should be considered together.View image in fullscreenAgriculture minister Julie Collins in the House of Representatives.Photograph: Mike Bowers/The GuardianThe delegate argued that approval of the development should include conditions to protect “the resource base on which agriculture depends” – including groundwater – and Indigenous culture.McCarthy’s delegate told the environment department that First Nations groups were concerned about the project’s connection to fracking, which they opposed due to its potential impact on “water supplies and aquifers, the environment, culture, sacred sites and songlines”.But a delegate for the minister for resources and northern Australia, Madeleine King, backed APA Group’s view that the pipeline did not need a full assessment, arguing it was “unlikely to cause significant impact on protected matters” under environment law and was “key enabling infrastructure to Tamboran’s activity within the Beetaloo basin”.Download original documentHannah Ekin, from the Arid Lands Environment Centre, said in her opinion the brief showed gas industry interests had been prioritised over concerns about the environment and Indigenous culture.She said it was “really frustrating” that Plibersek did not act on calls for the pipeline to be fully assessed, and particularly that McCarthy’s comments had been disregarded, given she was an NT senator familiar with the region and local Indigenous concerns.Ekin said the environment department brief indicated the pipeline was found to not need an assessment in part because it was deemed as not “integral” to the extraction of gas. She said this made no sense given the pipeline’s explicit purpose was to ensure gas from Shenandoah could get to Darwin and be usedunder a deal between Tamboran and the NT government.She said the impact of the pipeline and the fracking development should have been assessed as one. “The federal government must stop putting off looking at the terrible impacts this fracking project will have on the local environment and on the climate,” Ekin said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Otherwise, she said, “it’s only a matter of time before we have an environmental disaster”.Georgina Woods, from the grassroots environmental organisation Lock the Gate Alliance, said the pipeline was “part of the apparatus for fracking in the NT” and should have activated a “water trigger” in federal law for a full assessment. The trigger requires the environment minister to consider the impact of major fossil fuel developments on water resources.“We don’t feel enough attention is being paid by the federal government to the environmental consequences already under way in the NT as part of the fracking industry,” Woods said. “To see the agriculture department raise concerns, to see the Indigenous affairs department raise concerns, and for these not to be taken up and acted upon is frustrating.”Federal ministers and the environment department declined to respond to questions from Guardian Australia. APA Group also declined to comment. The NT government was asked for its response.Warnings of ‘environmental catastrophe’Lock the Gate is challenging Tamboran Resources’ Shenandoah pilot project in the federal court, alleging it is likely to affect water resources and should not be allowed to go ahead unless referred to Watt for assessment. A hearing starts on Monday.Fracking in the Beetaloo basin is part of a planned major gas industry expansion overseen by the NT Country Liberal party government. It said this week it hadabandoned a commitment made before it was elected last yearto set a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for 2030.Scientists and environmentalists have accused the NT government of also overseeing a ramping up of forest and vegetation destruction on pastoral properties. Nearly 26,000 hectares – an area about 90 times larger than the Sydney CBD – was approved for clearing in the first six months of this year.More than half of the clearing was given the green light by the NT government’s pastoral land board in a nine-day period earlier this month. None of it was deemed significant enough to refer for assessment under federal environment laws for the potential impact on threatened species and ecosystems.Australia’s emissions up slightly in 2024 as Labor faces heat over ‘climate-wrecking’ gas projectRead moreKirsty Howey, from the Environment Centre NT, accused the CLP of unleashing an “environmental catastrophe” and “approving more deforestation in six months than has been approved in any one year in the last decade”.Watt this week met with representatives from industry, environment, farming and First Nations organisations to discuss changes to nature laws. He suggested they could both improve environmental protection and lead to faster approval decisions for development proposals.Howey said the laws should be immediately reformed “to stop the rampant deforestation and nature destruction occurring across northern Australia before it’s too late for the largest intact savanna woodland left on Earth”.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentNorthern TerritoryAnthony AlbaneseTanya PlibersekIndigenous AustraliansGasAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sea water was pumped from the hull as it was lifted.TMC Maritime, a British-based consultancy, said the vessel would be held upright, out of the water, for checks and preparations for its final journey.On Sunday, it is anticipated the floating crane platform will move the Bayesian to a special steel cradle at Termini Imerese.View image in fullscreenThe Bayesian being lifted by cranes during salvage operations on Saturday.Photograph: Igor Petyx/ReutersThe Bayesian was anchored just offshore near the port of Porticello, in the province of Palermo, when it sank during a violent storm shortly before dawn on 19 August 2024.Lynchhad beencleared two months earlier of fraud chargesin the US relating to the purchase of his company,Autonomy, by Hewlett-Packard in 2011, and was enjoying a voyage around Sicily to celebrate with his 18-year-old daughter, Hannah, and his wife, Angela Bacares, whose company owned the Bayesian.The lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife, Neda, the banker Jonathan Bloomer and his wife, Judy, and the yacht’s chef, Recaldo Thomas, were also killed when the vessel sank.

These “vulnerabilities” were “unknown to either the owner or the crew” as they were not included in the stability information book onboard.The MAIB said a possible “tornadic waterspout” headed towards the boats in the harbour.

He was given a 40-year ban from re-entering the country.Serdiuk’s home town of Komysh-Zoria, in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, was part of the territory occupied in the first weeks of Russia’s full-scale invasion in spring 2022. According to Moscow, it is now part of Russia. And because Serdiuk, the headteacher of a local school, refused to work for the new authorities, they decided he had no place living there.“I was born there, I’ve lived my whole life there, in the same place,” said Serdiuk, in a recent interview in the city of Zaporizhzhia, the regional capital still controlled by Kyiv, where he now lives. “Now I am kicked out of my own home and told I didn’t live in the country I thought I lived in? How is this possible?”The deportation of Serdiuk and his family is part of a continuing “cleansing” operation of the occupied territories, which may accelerate if US-led attempts to push Russia and Ukraine into a peace deal result in the freezing of the current frontlines, solidifying Russian control over the territory Moscow has seized over the past three years.View image in fullscreenVolunteers at a humanitarian hub show their ruined homes in Zaporizhzhia region.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianIn the early months of the invasion, Russian forces used lists to identify potentially troublesome pro-Ukrainian members of society in the occupied territories. Many werekidnapped, tortured and held in Russian jails. Perhaps wary of the cost and resources required to jail thousands more people, authorities have now employed a new tactic.“There were cases when they just came to people and said, ‘It’s in your interests to disappear from here, or we’ll have to take you to the basement,’ and then people left by themselves,” Serdiuk recalled.View image in fullscreenIvan Fedorov, the governor of Zaporizhzhia region.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianBut in his case and some others the authorities did not leave it to chance. Ivan Fedorov, the governor of Zaporizhzhia region, estimated that “hundreds” of people had been deported from the occupied part of the region in recent months. Vladimir Putin signed a decree in March that stipulates “Ukrainian citizens who have no legal basis for living in the Russian Federation are obliged to leave” by 10 September, or take Russian citizenship.Serdiuk was born in Komysh-Zoria, a small town home to around 2,000 people, and had lived there his whole life, except for a few years studying in nearby Berdiansk. He started working at the local school, which had about 240 pupils, in 1999, beginning as a maths teacher and in 2018 being made headteacher.View image in fullscreenPins on a map from people who moved or were deported from the occupied areas, at a humanitarian hub in Zaporizhzhia.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianKomysh-Zoria was occupied, without major fighting, in the first days of the full-scale invasion, and by April 2022, the new Russian authorities called a meeting of the school’s 30 teachers, demanding that they open the school and teach the Russian curriculum. Serdiuk refused, and most of the teachers followed suit.In the ensuing weeks, Russian soldiers came to Serdiuk’s home and tried to persuade him to open the school. First, they were polite. Then, the threats started: “If you don’t want all your employees to have house searches, tell them to go to work.” One PE teacher agreed to work for the Russians immediately, but most of the others held out, he said. His school remains closed, and students now attend schools in one of two nearby towns.“I told them I’d never work for them and I kept to that,” said Serdiuk. For three years, he sat at home, unemployed, as Russian control solidified over the region.At the end of 2023, Serdiuk was told that he and his family would be deported. They were given three days to prepare, and packed their possessions into a few suitcases, but then were left waiting for more than a month. Their passports had been seized so they could not leave of their own volition. Eventually, at the end of January, they were driven to the regional capital of Melitopol and then put in a minibus with another family. Each deportee was sat on a pair of seats, handcuffed to a guard sitting beside them.The minibus drove for 20 hours until it reached the mountainous border between Russia and Georgia. Two drivers took turns at the wheel. At the border, the Ukrainians were handed back their passports and told to cross to the Georgian side. Serdiuk and his wife were given a 40-year ban from Russian territory; his 21-year-old daughter was given 50 years.From Georgia, they flew to Moldova, then back into Ukraine and all the way to Zaporizhzhia, to arrive at a spot around 90 miles (140km) away from their homes. Serdiuk is now teaching private maths lessons in the city, and plans to find a job at a local school. “At least here I can talk normally and not be scared of every passing car,” he said.View image in fullscreenAt the humanitarian hub in Zaporizhzhia.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianBut the forced deportation brings with it a lot of pain, most notably that he had to leave behind his mother, who has advanced dementia, in occupied territory. Before 2022, she had been taking medication to slow the progression of the condition, but after the invasion the family was unable to get the pills and the effect was swift and devastating.“She can talk and walk but she can’t look after herself. It required constant vigilance, otherwise she would slip out of the house and walk back to the house where she was born,” said Serdiuk. When notice of the deportation came, Serdiuk drove his mother to his sister’s house and bade her farewell. He does not know if he will ever see her again.View image in fullscreenA woman at the humanitarian hub in Zaporizhzhia.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianDuring a long interview, Serdiuk used humour and sarcasm to offset the depressing reality, but the one time he became visibly emotional was when asked for his thoughts on possible plans to freeze the frontlines as part of a peace settlement.The idea is something being pushed by the US, and many in Ukraine also support this, feeling that a temporary respite would be better than continuing the grinding, bloody fight. For Serdiuk, however, it would mean an unacceptable sacrifice. “How could I support this? How could I say that it’s fine that I was pushed out of my home and can’t go back?”He also fears for his former pupils. While Russia has sent in new teachers to the occupied areas, Serdiuk said this mainly concerned bigger cities. In the small settlements of his district, most of the teachers remained local, he said, and might be trying to avoid some of the harsher aspects of the new Russian curriculum. However, he said that with the pressure to conform to the needs of the new authorities, the respite would only be temporary.“They are demanding that there are portraits of Putin on the walls, that the children draw pictures and write wishes for their soldiers,” he said. “This all breaks the psychological balance of a child. A year ago we lived in Ukraine, and now Ukraine is bad and we are drawing pictures of our liberators? If we freeze this conflict, then in two or three years these children will already be lost.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The prospecting has sparked resistance from residents who fear the mines will foul the soil, drain the water and fill the air with the rumbling thunder of heavy trucks.“They are destroying everything,” said Gomes, who runs the only cafe in the village with his partner. “They are taking our peace.”Covas do Barroso is among the first villages caught up in Europe’s efforts to green its economy. As the continent weans itself off fossil fuels that poison the air and heat the planet, demand for lithium is surging, to build batteries that can run electric vehicles and balance renewable-heavy power grids.Thousands of Serbians protest in Belgrade against lithium mineRead moreAcross Europe, people living near lithium deposits appear unconvinced that mines will bring good jobs and are unmoved by pleas to stop a bigger ecological threat. Attempts to push projects through in the face of local resistance have been met with cries of “colonialism”.In Serbia, broad swathes of society have taken to the streets over the past year to protest against a lithium mine planned for the Jadar valley. In France, a lithium mine planned beneath a kaolin quarry in Allier has alarmed activists and divided residents. In Covas do Barroso, in northern Portugal, people say their village – at the heart of a heritage farming region recognised by theUnited Nations– has been turned into a “sacrifice zone”.“You’re talking about destroying an area that has been classified as a globally important agricultural heritage site, an example of sustainability, an area with a system of water management that is at least over 500 years old,” said Catarina Alves Scarrott, a member of the protest group Unidos em Defesa de Covas do Barroso (UDCB). “You’re going to sacrifice all of this for open-pit mines. And then, you start to ask: for what?”The answer, for EU officials and the Portuguese government, is to obtain a soft white metal that is needed to stop burning fuels that make extreme weather dramatically worse – and do so without relying exclusively on foreign suppliers. Europe produces almost no lithium itself. More than three-quarters of the world’s raw supply comes from just three countries: Australia, Chile and China. The latter dominates the refined supply of lithium too.A chart showing the world’s top lithium-producing countriesGuardian graphicAnxious about energy security and scrambling to get more mines dug at home, the European Commission set a target last year of meeting 10% of demand for critical raw materials from domestic sources by 2030. In March, it listed the planned mine in Covas as one of 47 strategic mineral projects that would benefit from “coordinated support” to become operational. The decision is being challenged by MiningWatchPortugal, ClientEarth and UDCB, which lodged a complaint with the commission in June.Environmental concerns about waste and water are not the only factors that have left communities such as Covas wary of prospectors. Kwasi Ampofo, a metals and mining analyst at BloombergNEF, said the sales pitch had been made harder by the mining industry’s historically poor reputation for safety and the lack of skilled domestic labour forces to profit from the work.“It’s going to be very hard for the EU to develop primary sources of lithium domestically,” he said. “Not impossible, but very hard.”In Covas, the long-running struggle between villagers and miners has intensified as political support for the project has grown. The Portuguese environment ministry granted the British mining company Savannah Resources a one-year “administrative easement” in December that allows it to prospect in the land around Covas. The villagers filed an injunction that held up the process, but the ministry quickly allowed work to resume, arguing it was in the public interest.People in the village, where a tattered banner declares “no to the mine, yes to life”, say they feel misled by the miners and betrayed by the government. They accuse the company of trespassing on land it does not own – much of which is held in common ownership – and downplaying the nature and scale of the project. But opinions in the surrounding Boticas region are mixed, with some hopeful the project will boost a neglected rural economy.Savannah Resources declined to comment. It has previously told local media it is acting within the law and makes efforts to keep people informed. It projects the mine will produce enough lithium for half a million EV batteries a year and describes itself as “enabling Europe’s energy transition”.But the continent-wide resistance to lithium mining reveals a snag thatgreen groupsand mining companies alike have been reluctant to acknowledge. While surveys find vast public support for stronger climate action – as much as80-89%, according to a project by the Guardian and newsrooms around the world – the infrastructure for a carbon-free economy carries trade-offs that affected communities are often reluctant to bear.Some residents of Covas, which is itselfthreatened by wildfires and droughts, say they recognise the tension, even if they consider the costs too great.“Every village faced with a mine will say ‘no, no, no’, I get that,” said Jorge Esteves, a forestry worker. “But what’s different here is the proximity to our homes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gomes wants policymakers to find a solution that reflects society’s needs.Photograph: Ajit Niranjan/The GuardianStudies have shown that a societal shift away from private cars – such as creating walkable cities with good public transport – would greatlylimit the risein demand for lithium, as would halting the surge in SUVs that need big batteries.Analysts note there are also significant quantities of lithium in electronic waste such as phones and laptops that do not get recycled. For the lithium that does need to be extracted, harvesting it from brine does less damage to the environment than mining it from rocks.But with 250m combustion engine cars on EU roads and next to no lithium produced at home, electrifying vehicle fleets without domestic sources of lithium would still mean extracting more abroad. Analysts fear this would largely take place in regions with weaker environment and human rights laws.“It’s not necessarily a dilemma with no exit, but it’s a real one,” said Thea Riofrancos, a political scientist at Providence College who visited Covas and several others mining regions when writing a book about lithium extraction.UK urged not to exploit poor countries in rush for critical mineralsRead moreMines were most likely to face resistance from people when developers failed to include them in the decision-making process, she added.“It’s not the environmental risks or the water risks on their own – if they’re not combined with a sense of exclusion, then oftentimes those don’t in and of themselves cause protests,” she said. “It’s the harm combined with the lack of voice to be able to say something about that harm.”In the green hills of Covas, it is unclear whether a friendlier approach by Savannah and the authorities would have won people over or simply tempered their rage. But the anger at the process is palpable.“The biggest shock initially was not even the impact of the mine,” said Alves Scarrott, who grew up in Covas and moved to London. “It’s the attack on democracy, and democratic processes, and the rights of the people that live there.”Explore more on these topicsMiningLithium-ion batteriesPortugalClimate crisisEuropeUnited NationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The French president emphasised that Iran must “never acquire nuclear weapons” and said talks should be expedited.“I am convinced that a path exists to end war and avoid even greater dangers. To achieve this, we will accelerate the negotiations led by France and its European partners with Iran,” said Macron in a post on X.But Iran seemed unimpressed by the European diplomatic initiative, with one senior Iranian official telling Reuters that zero uranium enrichment was a dead end and that it would not negotiate over its ballistic missile programme.“In any case, Iran will review the European proposals in Tehran and present its responses in the next meeting,” the Iranian official said.Speaking in Istanbul, Araghchi said it would be “very, very dangerous for everyone” if the US intervened militarily in Israel’s war with Iran.Donald Trump has said thathe will decide within two weekswhether or not the US will join Israel in its bombing of Iran, saying he is waiting to give diplomacy a chance. On Saturday it was reported that the US is moving B-2 bombers to the Pacific island of Guam as Trump weighs possible strikes.Earlier, Yemen’s Houthis said they would target US ships in the Red Sea if Washington became involved in attacks on Iran.In May, the US and the Houthis agreed a ceasefire under which neither side would target the other.The war began on 13 June after Israel launched a wave of pre-dawn strikes on Iran in what it said was an operation aimed at preventing the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran quickly responded with missile and drone attacks, kicking off an escalating cycle of tit-for-tat bombings that has now entered its ninth day.A week of war that left Iran stunned and bloodiedRead moreIn Iran, at least 430 people had been killed and 3,500 wounded by Israeli strikes since fighting began, state media said. At least 25 people have been killed and hundreds injured by Iranian strikes in Israel.At root of the diplomatic impasse was Iran’s insistence that talks with the US were impossible under Israeli fire – and Israel’s refusal to halt its bombing, a stance bolstered by Washington.“It is obvious that I can’t go to negotiations with the US when our people are under bombardments under the support of the US,” Araghchi told reporters in Istanbul, where he was attending a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.On Friday, Trump said: “Israel is doing well, in terms of war, and Iran … is doing less well. It’s a little bit hard to get somebody to stop.” He added that the US was “ready, willing and able” to negotiate and that it had been speaking to Iran.European politicians have urged the use of diplomacy to reach a ceasefire, stressing that an expanded Israeli-US-Iran war could spiral out of control.Vladimir Putin has said he is willing to mediate between Israel and Iran, thelatter of which is a close ally of the Kremlin. In an interview with Sky News Arabia on Saturday, the Russian president said Moscow was opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons but there was no evidence that Iran aimed to build any.“We believe Iran has the right to use nuclear energy peacefully, and we are ready to help,” Putin said, echoing Iran’s insistence that its nuclear programme was meant for civilian purposes.View image in fullscreenMissiles fired from Iran in retaliation for Israeli attacks in the sky over Hebron.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn a 31 May report, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran had produced enriched uranium to a level of 60%, which the nuclear watchdog said was of “serious concern”. US intelligence said Iran was up to three years away from producing a nuclear weapon.Israel deployed 50 aircraft over Iran overnight, hitting the Isfahan nuclear site for the second time. Later in the day, large explosions were reported in the oil-producing region of Khuzestan in western Iran, as Israel’s military said that it was attacking “military infrastructure” in the area.Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said in an interview on Saturday that its attacks had delayed Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb for at least “two or three years”, and that the Israeli military campaign would continue.Explore more on these topicsIsraelIranMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

President Trump has been clear that can’t happen, and I agree.”Gabbard wasnominated to her positionin large part because of her scepticism of the US intelligence community and its role in the US involvement in a series of “forever wars” in the Middle East, especially the Iraq war.Her transition from Democrat to Trump supporter is indicative of the broad coalition that the president has united under his America First movement – and the potential for a schism as the US grows closer to launching an attack on Iran.Steve Bannon, an influential adviser who has been critical of the potential for a US-Iran war, was seen having lunch at the White House with Trump this week, after a series of podcast episodes in which he and other popular Maga pundits criticised what they saw as preparations for a preemptive US strike against Iran.Bannon came to lunch armed with talking points that the Iran strike would be a bad idea and the massive 30,000lb bunker-buster bombs that could target the Iranian uranium enrichment facility at Fordow may not destroy the target.The Guardian previously reported that Trump was not fully convinced the bombs would destroy the target, and has held off authorising strikes as he also awaits the possibility that the threat of US involvement would leadIranto talks.Others close to the administration have pushed back forcefully in support of a strike on Iran.Republican congressmen including Mitch McConnell and Tom Cotton have lashed out against the isolationist wing of Trump’s support; the radio host Mark Levin has personally spoken with Trump in support of stronger backing for Israel; and other top members of the administration – including secretary of state Marco Rubio – are avowed Iran hawks.Others, such as vice-president JD Vance, are public anti-interventionists but have limited their criticism of potential strikes to allow Trump the space to make a decision.But Bannon is believed to have an outsized influence on Trump’s decision-making on the war. According to US media, he has warned the president he shouldn’t trust Israeli intelligence that the Iranian government was seeking a nuclear weapon imminently.Others in the Maga wing of Trump’s support have sought to rebuild ties after sharply criticising the president’s positioning on the Israeli strikes against Iran. Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host, had called Trump earlier this week in order to apologise after blasting those advising Trump to launch strikes against Iran as “warmongers”.“Tucker is a nice guy,” Trump said from the Oval Office on Wednesday. “He called and apologised the other day because he thought he said things that were a little bit too strong, and I appreciated that.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpIranMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

There was no immediate response from Washington. A spokesperson for the Indian government did not respond to a request for comment.In May,a surprise announcementby Trump of a ceasefire brought an abrupt end to a four-day conflict between nuclear-armed foes India and Pakistan. Trump has since repeatedly said that he averted a nuclear war, saved millions of lives and grumbled that he got no credit for it.Pakistan agrees that US diplomatic intervention ended the fighting, butIndiasays it was a bilateral agreement between the two militaries. In a phone call with Trump last week, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, had made it “absolutely clear” that hostilities ceased only after Pakistan requested a ceasefire, and that no third-party mediation had taken place, said India’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri.Thawing of relations between Pakistan and US raises eyebrows in IndiaRead moreIn a social media post on Friday, Trump gave a long list of conflicts he said he had resolved, including India and Pakistan and the Abraham accords in his first term between Israel and some Muslim-majority countries.He added: “No, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do, including Russia/Ukraine, and Israel/Iran, whatever those outcomes may be, but the people know, and that’s all that matters to me!”Pakistan’s move to nominate Trump camein the same weekits army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, met the US leader for lunch. It was the first time that a Pakistani military leader had been invited to the White House when a civilian government was in place in Islamabad.Mushahid Hussain, a former chair of the senate defence committee in Pakistan’s parliament, suggested nominating Trump for the peace prize was justified.“Trump is good for Pakistan,” he said. “If this panders to Trump’s ego, so be it. All the European leaders have been sucking up to him big time.”But the move was not universally applauded in Pakistan, where Trump’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza has inflamed tensions.“Israel’s sugar daddy in Gaza and cheerleader of its attacks on Iran isn’t a candidate for any prize,” said Talat Hussain, a prominent Pakistani television political talkshow host, in a post on X.Explore more on these topicsPakistanDonald TrumpIndiaSouth and central AsiaNobel peace prizeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The timing now is deliberate – a policy-heavy counteroffensive in theso-called red wall, where Reform UK has surged in recent polling.The skills package responds to a stark reality: one in seven young people are not in education or employment, and the number of apprenticeships has fallen by nearly 20% since 2016.The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, called the strategy an “economic and social reset”. “Skills rightly run right through the heart of this industrial strategy because they are key to breaking the link between background and success for young people,” she said.The strategy builds on previous announcements, including a £187m package for AI training announced during London Tech Week and a £3bn apprenticeship fund to create 120,000 places in healthcare, carpentry and construction.But the scale of new funding is modest – about £275m spread over four years, including roughly £200m for infrastructure and course delivery – and Labour may face pressure from industry and unions to go further in reforming the apprenticeship levy, immigration skills charge and energy costs for heavy industry.Explore more on these topicsIndustrial policyLabourManufacturing sectorApprenticeshipsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

One Kneecap band member is currently on bail, charged under the Terrorism Act.“As a publicly funded platform, the BBC should not be rewarding extremism.”Badenoch previously called for the group to be banned from Glastonbury. Last year Kneecap won a discrimination case against the UK government in Belfast high court after Badenoch tried to refuse them a £14,250 funding award when she was a minister in the previous government.A BBC spokesperson said: “As the broadcast partner, the BBC will be bringing audiences extensive music coverage from Glastonbury, with artists booked by the festival organisers.“Whilst the BBC doesn’t ban artists, our plans will ensure that our programming will meet our editorial guidelines. Decisions about our output will be made in the lead-up to the festival.”On Wednesday, Ó hAnnaidh, who performs under the stage name Mo Chara, was cheered by hundreds of supporters as he arrived with bandmates Naoise O Cairealláin and JJ Ó Dochartaigh at Westminster magistrates court in “Free Mo Chara” T-shirts.Ó hAnnaidh was released on unconditional bail until his next hearing on 20 August.After the hearing, the rapper said: “For anybody going to Glastonbury, you can see us there at 4pm on the Saturday.“If you can’t be there we’ll be on the BBC, if anybody watches the BBC. We’ll be at Wembley in September.“But most importantly: free, free Palestine.”The charge followed a counter-terrorism police investigation after gig footage came to light, which also allegedly showed the group calling for the deaths of MPs. In April, Kneecap apologised to the families of murdered MPs but said footage of the incident had been “exploited and weaponised”.Explore more on these topicsKneecapKeir StarmerGlastonbury 2025newsShareReuse this content"

First, he contacted a minister he knew, asking for an introduction to the minister who was best placed to make the decision. Second, he sent an email pressing a civil servant to set up a meeting. “My intervention is to elevate the discussion to ministerial level,” he wrote.Less than two weeks later, Dannatt and an executive behind the bid met Lee Rowley, the relevant business minister, to push for government backing.At issue is whether Dannatt broke the House of Lords rules that bar peers from lobbying ministers and officials in return for payment or financial incentive.Dannatt said he was not paid for engaging with the government. He said he helped a friend, a leading businessperson in the consortium, attempt to buy the factory as he believed it would save jobs and help the country. “Put simply, I was helping a friend achieve an outcome very much in the national interest,” he said.Dannatt later received four payments during the period he was chairing the venture. He described these as “honorarium” payments, but would not say how much he received.He was also the public face and “chairman” of the “embryonic” venture.Dannatt said his name and position added credibility to the discussions with the US company. “I am not sure how else a retired four-star general who sits in the House of Lords could be described to the Americans,” he said, but he had agreed to take the title despite there being “no board to chair, no meetings to attend or other business to conduct”.His involvement with the consortium, which was ultimately unsuccessful in its bid, ended in February 2023.Dannatt hasbeen under investigation by the House of Lords authoritiessince March after the Guardian revealed he had offered to secure meetings with ministers for undercover reporters pretending to be commercial clients wanting to lobby the government.He had been secretly filmedtelling the undercover reportershe could make introductions within the government and that he would “make a point of getting to know” the best-placed minister.He is being investigated by the House of Lords commissioner for standards, the watchdog who scrutinises claims of wrongdoing in the upper chamber.Dannatt, 74, has previously denied the allegations, saying: “I am well aware of … the Lords code of conduct … I have always acted on my personal honour.”He is one of five peers toface conduct inquiries after a months-long investigationby the Guardian.The Lords debate project examined the commercial interests of members of the House of Lords amid concerns their activities were not being properly regulated. It revealed that 91 peers had been paidby commercial companies to give political or policy advice.The new documents regarding Dannatt’s communications with the government in June2022 were disclosed under freedom of information legislation.At the time Dannatt was fronting a group of investors who wanted to buy a fertiliser factory in Cheshire. CF Industries, the US owners, planned to permanently close the factory after energy prices made it unprofitable.The consortium of investors argued that their proposal would save 500 jobs and keep important products used in the agriculture and hospitality industries within the UK.On 10 June 2022, Dannatt emailed a junior business minister he knew, asking if he could tell him who was the minister with responsibility for this area. “If you could point me in the right direction, ideally with an introduction, and I can take it from there.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Six days later, the peer emailed a senior official in the business department, saying: “I am aware that [Dannatt’s friend] has been talking with officials but my intervention is to elevate the discussion to ministerial level. There are some quite key issues at stake here relating to jobs in the north-west and the price of some key commodities.”On 27 June, Dannatt and Mark Law, his friend who was also leading the consortium, met Rowley, then a minister in the business department.The Financial Times has previouslyreported that the consortium sought a government loan of up to £10m to help restart the factory.The government refused, arguing that it was purely a commercial matter. The consortium later collapsed.Dannatt said he had not had any formal arrangements or contract with the consortium, nor had he discussed with Law what his future role might have been if they had managed to buy the factory. “My motivation and purpose was to get a deal over the line, in the national interest,” he said.He said any assumption that he “would have developed a substantive and remunerated role as chairman and taken an active role in the work of the company” was wrong. He added that if the bid had been successful, “it would have been a very different matter”.As well as the continuing investigation by the House of Lords authorities, another watchdog has examined Dannatt’s conduct. Last month, it cleared Dannatt of being paid by the consortium to lobby the government.Harry Rich, the registrar of consultant lobbyists, is responsible for investigating whether individuals have broken the law by failing to declare that they have received money from a third party to lobby ministers or Whitehall’s most senior officials.However the House of Lords watchdog is considering the matter under a different set of rules which take a wider view of lobbying than the registrar of consultant lobbyists.The question now is whether, as the consortium’s chair, he advocated for the venture on the understanding that he could at some point benefit personally. This could be a breach of the Lords rules.Dannatt has passed his correspondence with the Guardian about his involvement with the consortium to the House of Lords commissioner who is investigating his conduct when speaking to undercover reporters.Do you have information about this story?

Arkansas also has a similar law that has been challenged in federal court.The Texas measure easily passed in the Republican-controlled state House and Senate in the legislative session that ended on 2 June.“The focus of this bill is to look at what is historically important to our nation educationally and judicially,” Republican state representative Candy Noble, a co-sponsor of the bill, said when it passed the House.The Ten Commandments laws are among efforts, mainly in conservative-led states, to insert religion into public schools. Texas lawmakers also passed a bill that lets school districts provide students and staff a daily voluntary period of prayer or time to read a religious text during school hours.Texas’ law requires public schools to post in classrooms a 16 x 20in (41 x 51cm) poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments, even though translations and interpretations vary across denominations, faiths and languages and may differ in homes and houses of worship.Supporters say the Ten Commandments are part of the foundation of the United States’ judicial and educational systems and should be displayed.Opponents, including some Christian and other faith leaders, say the Ten Commandments and prayer measures infringe on others’ religious freedom.A letter signed this year by dozens of Christian and Jewish faith leaders opposing the bill noted that Texas has thousands of students of other faiths who might have no connection to the Ten Commandments. Texas has nearly 6 million students in about 9,100 public schools.In 2005, Abbott, who was state attorney general at the time, successfully argued before the supreme court that Texas could keep a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of its capitol.Louisiana’s law has twice been ruled unconstitutional by federal courts, first by US district judge John deGravelles and then again by a three-judge panel of the fifth US circuit court of appeals, which also considers cases from Texas.State attorney general Liz Murrell said she would appeal and pledged to take it to the US supreme court if necessary.Explore more on these topicsTexasUS politicsRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

Thousands of households lost power.Hours earlier the National Weather Service in Grand Forksconfirmedon social media that two deaths were attributed to a tornado that hit a home.Timothy Lynch, lead forecaster with the NWS office in Grand Forks, said the storm was confirmed as a tornado but crews were still working to determine its strength and highest wind speeds. He said the storm impacted the neighboring counties of Cass and Ransom.“We still have people out investigating and gathering information on what happened. It was a pretty major event,” Lynch told the Associated Press.Governor Kelly Armstrong said in a statement that the NWS confirmed a second tornado touched down near Spiritwood, which is about 80 miles (130km) west of Fargo. Armstrong issued a statewide disaster declaration to respond to the damage.Heavy winds also swept across localized areas ofMinnesota, and the NWS reported wind gusts of up to 106mph (171km/h) at Bemidji regional airport overnight.“I cannot ever recall hearing a rushing wind like that!” Bemidji mayor Jorge Prince posted on Facebook in the early hours of Saturday. “Emerged from our basement to find our neighborhood with lots of trees down and several homes with severe damage.”Prince also said officials were responding to many knocked down power lines and several gas line leaks. Localized torrential rain flooded the city’s downtown and stalled vehicles, Beltrami county emergency management director Christopher Muller said.Many Bemidji-area businesses posted on social media to say they were without power and closed for the day. Muller warned people to prepare for “long-term power outages” because of damage to infrastructure.Hurley said that same storm moved on in a weakened state to parts of Michigan. It was expected to cross over lower Ontario and back into the United States to hit upstate New York on Saturday night into Sunday.“Still wind and hail threat,” Hurley said of the enhanced risk to upstate New York. “It doesn’t look like it’s going to be as robust perhaps as we saw last night.”Warm and dry conditions coupled with frequent thunderstorms and lightning have resulted in more than 100 fires in the state since Wednesday.“A lot of those fires are in vast wilderness areas of Alaska where fire is allowed to take its natural course,” said Sam Harrel, an information officer with the state’s Division of Forestry and Fire Protection.But some fires were threatening populated areas, prompting evacuations in the interior region. Among them was a go order issued Friday for areas near Fairbanks, according to Harrel.A fire burning about 30 miles (50km) north of the entrance to Denali national park and preserve also prompted an evacuation “due to escalating fire conditions”, the Denali Borough said via Facebook.“Numerous structures are now imminently threatened so aircraft including Air Tankers and helicopters are supporting the fire with retardant and water drops,” the borough added.Harrel said the fire was not affecting the status of the park but the smoke could worsen air quality for visitors.Explore more on these topicsUS weatherNorth DakotaMinnesotaTornadoesnewsShareReuse this content"

That is the weapon that experts say could be used to strike Iran’s nuclear program, including Fordow.The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, declined to disclose any further details. One official said no forward orders had been given yet to move the bombers beyondGuam. They did not say how many B-2 bombers are being moved.The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Experts and officials are closely watching to see whether the B-2 bombers will move forward to a US-British military base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia. Experts say that Diego Garcia is in an ideal position to operate in the Middle East.The United States had B-2 bombers on Diego Garcia up until last month, when they were replaced with B-52 bombers.Israel said on Saturday it had killed a veteran Iranian commander during attacks by both sides in the more than week-long air war, while Tehran said it would not negotiate over its nuclear program while under threat.Israel says Iran was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons, while Iran says its atomic program is only for peaceful purposes.Trump has said he would take up to two weeks to decide whether the United States should enter the conflict on Israel’s side, enough time “to see whether or not people come to their senses,” he said.Reuters was first to report this week the movement of a large number of tanker aircraft to Europe and other military assets to the Middle East, including the deployment of more fighter jets.An aircraft carrier in the Indo-Pacific is also heading to the Middle East.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryDonald TrumpGuamUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

I’m happy to hear that the Dodgers have done that, and it’s certainly the right thing to do.”The Dodgers were briefly at the center of southern California’s opposition to federal immigration policy when the team asked federal agents to leave the stadium grounds on Thursday after they amassed at a parking lot near one of the gates.Dozens of federal agents with their faces covered arrived at a lot near the stadium’s Gate E entrance in SUVs and cargo vans. A group of protesters carrying signs against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrived shortly afterward, and the agents eventually left.Roberts claimed his players had not extensively discussed the situation in the clubhouse, but some Dodgers have been paying attention.Kiké Hernández, a Puerto Rico native, sharply criticized the raids on social media last weekend. “I may not be born and raised, but this city adopted me as one of their own,” Hernández wrote. “I cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart. ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights.”Baseball Hall of Famer Jaime Jarrín, the Dodgers’ lead Spanish-language broadcaster from 1959 until his retirement in 2022, also spoke up against the federal actions. “As an immigrant who came to this country 70 years ago, I know firsthand the hope, courage and determination it takes to build a new life in a new land,” Jarrín posted Tuesday on social media. “I have always believed that immigration is not just part of the American story; it is the American story.“Los Angeles is my home,” Jarrín added. “This city is my family. And it breaks my heart to see the growing division in our community and across the country. We all deserve to be treated with dignity, respect and humanity.”The mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, praised the Dodgers in the team’s news release.“I want to thank the Dodgers for leading with this action to support the immigrant community of Los Angeles,” Bass said. “These last weeks have sent shockwaves of fear rippling through every neighborhood and have had a direct impact on our economy. My message to all Angelenos is clear: We will stick together during this time and we will not turn our backs on one another – that’s what makes this the greatest city in the world.”Fans and lawmakers have called upon the Dodgers for several days to make an unequivocal statement of opposition to the raids, given their vast Latino fan base and heavy influence in the region. Other teams in the region have expressed their solidarity with the immigrant community, including LAFC and Angel City FC.Congressman Jimmy Gomez, who represents the Los Angeles area, went on social media to ask the Dodgers to speak up.“In a city where 36% of the residents are immigrants and nearly 40% of the team’s fan base is Latino, saying nothing is not just disappointing – it’s a betrayal and an insult,” Gomez wrote. “Silence is not an option. It’s a choice.”Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles DodgersBaseballMLBUS sportsLos Angeles Ice protestsCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Quite aside from the endless politicking, the forever-war with Uefa, the consorting with autocrats and the intriguing broadcast rights and partnership deals, there has been, not a new, but growing sense during theClub World Cupthat Fifa doesn’t really get football. There is something cargo-cultish about it, creating outcomes without engaging in processes.Perhaps that is inevitable with Gianni Infantino’s style of leadership; like all populists, he is big on vision and short on practical reality. It was there in theexpansion of the World Cupto 48 teams.America is showing us football in its final dictator form – we can’t afford to look away | Barney RonayRead moreOK: how will the tournament be organised? Sixteen groups of three. Won’t that mean either lots of potential dead rubbers (one team from each group goes through) or opportunities for collusion (two go through)? Oh, actually, the four-team groups at the 2022 have worked so well, we’ll go with 12 groups of four. Sure, but then you have eight best third-place teams going through which: a) diminishes jeopardy; and b) undermines sporting integrity by giving an advantage to teams in later groups because they have a clearer idea of what is needed to progress, again offering opportunities for collusion. No response, because all that matters is a bigger tournament equals more votes for the president and (in the short term) more revenue.One of the oddest aspects of the Club World Cup has been the way players are greeted on to the pitch individually, like swimmers before an Olympic final. At Ulsan HD v Mamelodi Sundowns, they may as well have gone on and introduced the crowd as well. Who needs this? Who wants this? Why does the first player out have to hang around for several minutes waiting for the 22nd player?For well over a century the two teams have walked out side by side. This has always been part of the gladiatorial ritual of football. This is the contest: one team against another. But asFifahas sought desperately to improve attendances and stimulate interest, its focus has become more and more on the individual.View image in fullscreenWhile the desire to see Lionel Messi is understandable, his club, Inter Miami are sixth in MLS’s Western Conference.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAThat is why there was all that talk, much of it emanating from Infantino, about Cristiano Ronaldo potentially securing a short-term deal with a qualifier, and why qualifying was gerrymandered to ensure the presence of Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami. But there is a potentially self-defeating short-termism to this.While the desire to see Messi is entirely understandable, especially as he enters the late autumn of his career, Inter Miami are sixth in MLS’s Western Conference, theirform having disintegratedsince the end of March. From an MLS point of view, the ideal scenario would have been for one of their sides to beat a storied opponent, perhaps push on to the quarter-finals, generating interest in North America’s domestic league. The best way of doing that would have been to have the best-possible MLS representation, but Inter Miami are in no sense one of the best three sides.As it is, none of the MLS sides won their opening game, althoughPorto’s dismal form and Messi’s dead-ball abilitymay get Inter Miami through anyway. It might also be pointed out that Auckland City are not the best side in New Zealand, nor are Red Bull Salzburg one of the best 12 sides in Europe, but the consequences are greater for the host nation, particularly when there is apparently so much potential for growth.The celebritisation of football is not new, but it is intensifying. When Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in 2016 and, rather than speaking of the Premier League or becoming a European champion, said he dreamed of winning the Ballon d’Or, it felt shocking, a player elevating his own interests and a silly bauble above the glory of team success. But that has become normal. Improving his Ballon d’Or chances is one of the reasons Neymar left Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain; even Trent Alexander-Arnold mentioned the Ballon d’Or asa motivation for joining Real Madrid(good luck with that from right-back).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s been particularly so at the Club World Cup, but it is true of almost every competition. Even the way lineups are introduced on Sky’s Premier League coverage, with the players performing a fake celebration, seems designed to introduce them as characters.Yet there is a tension there. While individual players are celebrated, the increasing use of data means image and self-projection may never have mattered less. The stats will find the talent, even if the talent has no gift for self-promotion. At the same time, the best teams have never been so cohesive, so integrated.View image in fullscreenBenfica’s Nicolás Otamendi walks on to the pitch before the game against Boca Juniors as the players are introduced one by one.Photograph: Marco Bello/ReutersPSG provide a useful case study. For years they signed stars with seemingly little thought to how they might play together. Although their immense resources won them the French league, they habitually choked in Europe. Then there was a change of approach, the money was spent not on Neymar and Messi but on players on the way up who still had a hunger for success and who could play together. The result was the Champions League and,despite their defeat by Botafogo, possibly the inaugural world title in the expanded format.If it was conceived as a two-stage strategy – build the brand through celebrity, then win the actual competitions – it has worked to perfection; in reality, it’s probably trial and error that has brought them to this point. At Real Madrid, meanwhile, Florentino Pérez still seems locked in hisgalácticovision of football, insisting on adding Kylian Mbappé to a squad that already contained Vinícius Júnior and Rodrygo, resulting in imbalance and an expensive downturn in form.This goes deeper than transfer policies, though. This feels like a fundamental tension at the heart of the game. What, after all, is success in modern football? Manchester City for the past decade have been a much better football team than PSG, and yet they have nothing like the brand awareness. Is success winning trophies, or making money? Is it winning trophies or becoming more famous? Is it winning trophies or marketing the individual?The individual walk-ons only blur the lines further, suggest organisers who struggle with the concept that football, perhaps more than any other sport, is a game of the team.Explore more on these topicsFifaInside footballClub World Cup 2025Paris Saint-GermainClub World CupFootball politicsInter MiamiLionel MessicommentShareReuse this content"

I’m happy to hear that the Dodgers have done that, and it’s certainly the right thing to do.”The Dodgers were briefly at the center of southern California’s opposition to federal immigration policy when the team asked federal agents to leave the stadium grounds on Thursday after they amassed at a parking lot near one of the gates.Dozens of federal agents with their faces covered arrived at a lot near the stadium’s Gate E entrance in SUVs and cargo vans. A group of protesters carrying signs against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrived shortly afterward, and the agents eventually left.Roberts claimed his players had not extensively discussed the situation in the clubhouse, but some Dodgers have been paying attention.Kiké Hernández, a Puerto Rico native, sharply criticized the raids on social media last weekend. “I may not be born and raised, but this city adopted me as one of their own,” Hernández wrote. “I cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart. ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights.”Baseball Hall of Famer Jaime Jarrín, the Dodgers’ lead Spanish-language broadcaster from 1959 until his retirement in 2022, also spoke up against the federal actions. “As an immigrant who came to this country 70 years ago, I know firsthand the hope, courage and determination it takes to build a new life in a new land,” Jarrín posted Tuesday on social media. “I have always believed that immigration is not just part of the American story; it is the American story.“Los Angeles is my home,” Jarrín added. “This city is my family. And it breaks my heart to see the growing division in our community and across the country. We all deserve to be treated with dignity, respect and humanity.”The mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, praised the Dodgers in the team’s news release.“I want to thank the Dodgers for leading with this action to support the immigrant community of Los Angeles,” Bass said. “These last weeks have sent shockwaves of fear rippling through every neighborhood and have had a direct impact on our economy. My message to all Angelenos is clear: We will stick together during this time and we will not turn our backs on one another – that’s what makes this the greatest city in the world.”Fans and lawmakers have called upon the Dodgers for several days to make an unequivocal statement of opposition to the raids, given their vast Latino fan base and heavy influence in the region. Other teams in the region have expressed their solidarity with the immigrant community, including LAFC and Angel City FC.Congressman Jimmy Gomez, who represents the Los Angeles area, went on social media to ask the Dodgers to speak up.“In a city where 36% of the residents are immigrants and nearly 40% of the team’s fan base is Latino, saying nothing is not just disappointing – it’s a betrayal and an insult,” Gomez wrote. “Silence is not an option. It’s a choice.”Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles DodgersBaseballMLBUS sportsLos Angeles Ice protestsCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

An impressive quarter-final victory over a Spain side who were the pre-tournament favourites and intent on dishing out revenge will certainly not have done either any harm.After Englandstruggled to reach the last eightwith an inexperienced squad that is one of the youngest in Slovakia, goals from James McAtee and Harvey Elliott – both of whom have uncertain futures at their clubs – and a late penalty from Elliot Anderson sealed another triumph for Carsley over the same opponents England saw offin the 2023 final. With the Netherlands up next in Wednesday’s semi-final in Bratislava, he is now two matches away from matching Dave Sexton’s feat of winning this competition in 1982 and 1984.Spain 1-3 England: European Under-21 Championship quarter-final – live reactionRead more“In the first half we were so good,” said Carsley. “The big thing is this can’t be our final – there’s better nights to come.”Spain have become regular opponents for England in the latter stages of various youth tournaments over recent years, although only their coach, Santi Denia, remained from their bad-tempered defeat in the final two years ago, when when both sides had a member of the coaching staff and a player sent off. There were similar scenes in Trnava at the final whistle as tempers flared between the benches but it was a reflection of how England had frustrated Spain after they pulled back a goal from Javi Guerra’s penalty late in the first half.“There was a major difference from start to finish: we were disciplined and compact,” said Elliott, who along with Charlie Cresswell is the only surviving member of the 2023 triumph in Georgia. “We trusted in our own ability. The football was incredible, we need to take a lot from this into the next game.”View image in fullscreenJames McAtee opens the scoring in the 10th minute.Photograph: Petr David Josek/APCarsley’s side looked like they might be overwhelmed in the first two minutes when Diego López headed over from close range and the Italian referee, Simone Sozza, pointed to the spot for the first time after a powerful shot from López struck Cresswell on the arm. But the video assistant referee saw it differently and – to the Toulouse defender’s relief as he pumped his fist in celebration – the penalty was overturned.That proved to be the wake-up call England needed. McAtee looks likely to leave Manchester City this summer, having been allowed to play here rather than travel to the Club World Cup, and showed his eye for goal when he was quickest to react after Spain made a hash of clearing Alex Scott’s corner.Jarell Quansah was the architect of the second after Birmingham’s Jay Stansfield, leading the line one of four changes from the defeat to Germany in midweek, forced a loose pass. The Liverpool defender is on the verge of joining Bayer Leverkusen for £30m, while Elliott’s future at Anfield is also in question following the arrival of Florian Wirtz from the German club. But when Quansah strode forward and unleashed a shot that was not convincingly saved, Elliott was on hand to turn in the rebound.

Scott gave the ball away in a dangerous area and when Quansah tripped Alberto Moleiro, this time there was no debate as Guerra swept home the penalty.England looked determined to finish the job at the start of the second half but Stansfield’s touch let him down following another surging run from Quansah and his shot deflected over, with Cresswell heading the corner inches wide. There were hearts in mouths when a cross from the right fizzed across the six-yard area but Cresswell came to England’s rescue with an acrobatic clearance.Spain continued to press for an equaliser and Jack Hinshelwood could have settled Carsley’s nerves had he directed a free header from Anderson’s cross on target rather than over the crossbar. But when the substitute Jonathan Rowe was brought down by Alejandro Iturbe in injury time, Anderson made no mistake with his penalty, before an ugly confrontation in which members of Spain’s coaching staff had to be separated from their England counterparts.Explore more on these topicsEuropean Under-21 ChampionshipEngland Under-21snewsShareReuse this content"

Palace are looking to cash in on the England defender, who is a target for Liverpool, Newcastle and Tottenham, but there is a possibility of the club losing one of their biggest assets on a free transfer next year.Guéhi, who has no intention of signing an extension, remains open-minded about his next destination and a big consideration for the 24-year-old is making sure he has plenty of playing time next season.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreThe former Chelsea centre-back, who played an integral rolein Palace winning the FA Cup, needs to safeguard his place in the England squad before the 2026 World Cup. That means there is an obvious benefit in joining a club who can offer Guéhi a quick route into their starting XI.Liverpool have emerged as strong contenders to sign Guéhi and could bid for him once they sell Jarell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen for £30m. A potential stumbling block, however, is that Liverpool still have the outstanding duo of Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté as their first-choice pairing in central defence. Van Dijk, 33, has extended his contract with the Premier League champions and is showing no sign of slowing down.The sale of Quansah will leave Liverpool short of defensive cover. The 22-year-old centre-back made 25 appearances for Arne Slot’s team last season and can also play at right-back. Konaté is entering the final year of his deal and has struggled with injuries at times. Joe Gomez, another of Liverpool’s defensive options, has been out since February with a hamstring injury.Guéhi will face a big decision if Liverpool follow up their interest in him by offering enough for Palace to sell. A chance to join the best team in England and work with Slot would be hard to turn down. At the same time there are indications that clubs who can immediately guarantee him regular football retain a good chance of signing him.View image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi needs to safeguard his position in England’s squad with the World Cup next year.Photograph: Adam Davy/PANewcastletried to buy Guéhilast summer, only to be put off by Palace’s asking price of about £70m, and they remain in the mix after qualifying for the Champions League. Their current options at centre-back include three players in their 30s – Dan Burn, Fabian Schär and Jamaal Lascelles – and the 25-year-old Sven Botman, who missed much of last season through injury.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Spurs, who have qualified for the Champions League, had an offer of £55m plus £15m in add-ons rejected in January. There seems little prospect of Chelsea following up preliminary interest in Guéhi.Guéhi staying at Palace for another year before leaving for nothing has not been ruled out. He can speak to foreign clubs about signing a pre-contract from January. For Palace, there is a question of making sure their demands remain realistic this summer.

Dortmund were behind after 11 minutes to the South African champions at the TQL Stadium in Cincinnati but rallied to win their second game in Group F and move top of the standings with four points, one more than Sundowns.Felix Nmecha, Serhou Guirassy and Jobe Bellingham scored for the Bundesliga club, who also profited from an own goal. Lucas Ribeiro had given Sundowns the lead while Iqraam Rayners and Lebo Mothiba scored in the second half as they looked to rally from 4-1 down in blazing hot conditions.America is showing us football in its final dictator form – we can’t afford to look away | Barney RonayRead moreDortmund’s coach, Niko Kovac, said: “We had a hard battle against the heat and an opponent who could handle the conditions better. This is a tournament that we want to compete in and try to win a World Cup title but the conditions are very hard for all for the teams.” Dortmund released a picture showing their substitutes watching the first half in the dressing room, to escape the heat.Ribeiro burst through a static Dortmund defence, picking up the ball on the halfway line and gliding past two opponents to score a shock opener. But the lead lasted only five minutes before a calamitous error from Sundowns goalkeeper Ronwen Williams, whose short misplaced pass to Nmecha gave him an easy tap-in for the equaliser.Dortmund went ahead after a slick set of one-two passes between Julian Brandt and Guirassy, who powered home with his head. Bellingham, in his second appearance for Dortmund, made it 3-1 on the stroke of half-time as Williams parried Brandt’s cross straight at him, and he delayed shooting for a split second before wrongfooting the goalkeeper.View image in fullscreenBorussia Dortmund’s Serhou Guirassy scores their second goal against Sundowns.Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/ReutersRayners struck the woodwork for Sundowns 10 minutes into the second half but on the hour mark Daniel Svensson’s cross from the left took a wicked deflection off Sundowns’ full-back Khuliso Mudau as Dortmund extended their lead.Two minutes later, the South African side pulled one back as Teboho Mokoena’s free-kick was floated to Rayners, who struck the foot of the post but the rebound bounced back on to his head and he did not waste the second opportunity.Mothiba struck in the 90th minute as Sundowns stole away possession and the substitute scored from close range but they could not find an equaliser.The Sundowns coach, Miguel Cardoso, said: “I think it was clear that we pushed the level of the game to the maximum and that we were able to pay an open game against such a strong opponent. I’m very proud of the resilience that we showed.”Inter 2-1 Urawa Red DiamondsValentin Carboni scored in the second minute of added time to complete Inter’s rally to a 2-1 victory overUrawa Red Diamondsin their Group E match in Seattle. Carboni’s strike secured all three points for Inter 14 minutes after Lautaro Martínez’s brilliant volleyed equaliser from a corner.Shusaku Nishikawa scored early for the second goal of the tournament and first from open play for the Red Diamonds, who were overwhelmingly on the back foot from there on.Inter led their Japanese foes 26-5 in total shots and 4-3 in efforts on target, though their first shot on frame did not come until Martínez levelled the score with his 24th goal in all competitions this season.Against the run of play, Watanabe put Red Diamonds in front in the 11th minute. Takuro Kaneko created the opportunity with a wonderful slaloming run from the right into the penalty area that split two Inter defenders, before dragging a cross back toward the penalty spot. Watanabe met it with a first-time, side-footed shot that deflected off another defender, wrongfooting Yann Sommer on its way into the bottom right corner.Inter finally began to show more menace in the final stages, beginning with Martínez’s leveller. Nicolò Barella sent in the outswinging corner. With his back to goal, Martínez shielded a defender from the ball, then met it waist high with a volley sent over his back past goalkeeper Shusaku Nishikawa. It was Martínez’s second goal of the tournament after he pulled Inter level against Monterrey with a set piece goal late in the first half of a 1-1 draw on Tuesday.View image in fullscreenLautaro Martínez contorts himself to bring Inter level in Seattle.Photograph: Stephen Brashear/Imagn Images/ReutersThen in stoppage time, Carboni was first to the rebound of Petar Sucic’s blocked shot from the edge of the penalty area, driving a low and hard finish from 10 yards into the bottom left corner.River Plate, whom Inter face in their last group game on Wednesday, are playing Monterrey later on Saturday in California, looking to move back to the top of the group.Fluminense 4-2 UlsanJuan Freytes put Fluminense in front in the 83rd minute and Keno’s added time header sealed a 4-2 victory over UIsan HD in an engrossing Group F contest in East Rutherford on Saturday night.Freytes’ winner – his first goal for the Brazilian club – came 17 minutes after teammate Nonato leveled during a contest where the lead twice changed hands.John Arias also scored from an early free kick as Fluminense moved even on points and goal difference with Dortmund at theClub World Cup.Jinhyun Lee and Um Won-Sang scored for Ulsan but it wasn’t enough and the South Korean club was eliminated with the result.Freytes put Fluminense in front for good after the South Koreans failed to clear a corner, dispatching a composed finish inside the right post after receiving German Cano’s tidy pass.View image in fullscreenJuan Freytes celebrates with German Cano after scoring his team’s third goal at MetLife Stadium.Photograph: Elsa/FIFA/Getty ImagesNine minutes later, Keno’s header from a Jhon Arias cross sealed the victory against a clearly fatigued Ulsan defence.Ulsan struck twice inside the final 10 minutes of the first half to turn an early deficit into a half-time lead before Fluminense levelled at 2-2 through a composed Nonato finish in the 66th minute.Late in the first half, Lee Jin-hyun leveled for Ulsan in the 37th minute on an exceptional counterattack. Darijan Bojanic’s initial pass from just beyond his own box sprung Um Won-Sang down the right. Won Sang’s low cross rolled all the way across the box and beyond goalkeeper Fabio’s dive before Lee met it on the opposite flank. From a tight angle, Lee delivered an excellent first-touch finish into an open goal.It was the same duo connecting in reverse in first-half added time, when after a poor Fluminense partial clearance Won Sang met Lee’s cross with a powerful diving header beyond Fabio’s dive into the bottom left corner.For the opening 30 minutes it was Fluminense who looked far more likely to score. The lead eventually came through Arias in the 27th minute on his ferociously struck free kick that beat goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo to the top right corner.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Borussia DortmundInternazionaleUrawa Red DiamondsClub World CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Onana, however, is keen to remain at United despite his patchy form at the club.Why Hugo Ekitike is hot property in the summer transfer windowRead moreSince joining in July 2023 from Inter, the Cameroonian has been an inconsistent performer, making a number of costly errors. Last season Amorim dropped Onana for a4-1 defeat by Newcastleon 13 April due to his culpability for both Lyon goals in the2-2 Europa League quarter-final drawin United’s previous match.While the head coach reinstated Onana for the return leg, and he played well inthe 5-4 win, Amorim may consider recruiting a new first-choice goalkeeper if a viable deal was possible.“We are going to make that evaluation for any position in the squad,” Amorim said. “We need to improve. We cannot change all the players. We need to improve every position on the field. Goalkeeper is the same; we can work with André. André Onana already proved he is a top player with Inter. We have some seasons where we are [all] underperforming.”Financial constrictions may require that Onana, who has three years left on his United contract, departs to generate the funds for a new goalkeeper. Altay Bayindir, Onana’s understudy, is expected to leave Old Trafford in the next window.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedMonacoTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Is it best to stay away from next summer’s Trump-Infantino US World Cup? Depending on your politics the answer may be a resoundingnoor a bemused shrug. Some will see pure drive-by entertainment. Why would anyone want to boycott a month-long end-of-days Grand Soccer Parade staged by two of the world’s most cinematic egomaniacs?But it is a question that has been asked, and will be asked a lot more in the next year. Those who intend to travel will need to answer it by action or omission. Would it be better for dissenting media and discomfited football fans to simply no-platform this event?The picture is at least clearer now. After a week of the new steroid-fedClub World Cupwe know what this thing will feel like and who it will benefit. There is no mystery with these events now, no sense of politics lurking coyly out of sight.UnderGianni InfantinoFifa has become a kind of mobile propaganda agency for indulgent regimes, right out in front twirling its pompoms, hitching its leotard, twerking along at the front of the parade like an unholy Uncle Sam.So we had thegrisly sight this week of Donald Trumpnot just borrowing football’s light, but wrestling it on to his lap and ruffling its hair, burbling like a random hot-button word generator about women and trans people, while Juventus players gawped in the background.0:42Trump asks Juventus players during White House visit whether a woman would make their team – videoWe have the spectacle of both club and international football hijacked as a personal vanity platform for Infantino, the dictator’s fluffer, the man who sold the world not once but twice.Infantino’s status as a wildly over-promoted administratorhas always had an operatic quality. But there is something far more sinister in his political over-reach, out there nodding along at the latest Oval Office freak-off, helping to legitimise each divisive statement, each casual erasure of process.Nobody gaveFifaa mandate to behave like this. Its mission is to promote and regulate. And yet here is it acting as a commercial disruptor in its own sport and as a lickspittle to the powerful, disregarding the human rights fluff and political neutrality enshrined in its “statutes”, offering zero transparency or accountability.View image in fullscreenLionel Messi’s fame has added a lustre to the Club World Cup but the tournament is hardly noticeable in the US outside the stadiums.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersTo date Infantino’s only public interface in the US is a “fireside chat”, AKA approved PR interview, at the Dick’s Sporting Goods stage in New York. There he is, up there on the Stage of Dick’s, mouthing platitudes to pre-programmed questions, high on his own power supply, the newly acquired Gianni glow-up eyebrows arched in a patina of inauthenticity. They say celebrity is a mask that eats into the face. Take a look at what football can do to you.And so far this tournament has presented the full grotesquery in store. What is the Club World Cup like on the ground? Pretty much the same as it is on the screen given this event is invisible in physical form beyond the stadiums.The key takeaway is confirmation of the weirdly jackboot, cult-like nature of the Infantino-shaped universe. Even the optics are trying to tell you something, all black holes, hard surfaces, gold, power-flash.Why does Fifa have its own vast lighted branding on the pitch like a global super-corporation or a military dictatorship? What is the Club World Cup logo supposed to represent, with its weird angular lines, the void at its heart? An obscure Stalinist plug socket? Darth Vader’s space fighter? Not to mention the bizarre obsession with that shapeless and indefinable trophy, present on the big screen in every ground in weird scrolling closeup, one minute a Sauron’s eye, the next some kind of finger-snapping torture instrument, with its secret draws full of ectoplasm, a dead crow, the personal effects of Pol Pot.Mainly there is the very openly manipulative nature of the spectacle, football in its final dictator form, with a sense of utter disdain for its captive consumer-subjects. Yes, they will literally put up with anything if we pipe it into their smartphones. So here is beauty, love, colour, connection, the things you’re hard-wired to respond to, cattle-prodded into your nervous system for the benefit of assorted interests. Here is football reimagined as a kind of mass online pornography. Fifa even calls its media website Fifahub.View image in fullscreenWhy does Fifa have its own vast lighted branding on the pitch like a global super-corporation or a military dictatorship?Photograph: Marco Bello/ReutersWith all this in mind some have suggesteda World Cup and US boycottis the correct and logical response, not least in two recent articlespublished in these pages. The organisation Human Rights Watch has carried a warning about the implications of staging the tournament under the Trump regime. Guardian readers and social media voices have asked the same question from all sides of discourse.The hostile versions of this: if you don’t like it then just don’t come, we don’t want you anyway [expletives deleted]. If you were worried about us in Qatar, western imperialist, why are you going to the US? And from the liberal left a concern that to report on sport is also to condone a regime that sends deportation officers to games, imposes travel bans on Fifa members and is edging towards another remote war.And all the while marches football around in a headlock, snapping its underwear elastic, saying thanks, Gianni, for the distracting firework show.This is not a normal situation. So why normalise it? Why give it legitimising light and heat? And yet, one week into the World Cup’s rehearsal dinner, the only logical response is: you just have to go. Not only would a boycott serve no practical purpose; it would be counterproductive, an act of compliance for a regime that will happily operate without an opposing voice on the stage.There are two structural reasons for this. And a third that relates to the United States itself, or at least to the idea of the United States, to its possibilities, which are not defined by Trump, by the latest military action, or by Infantino.Most obviously, if you leave the stage you abandon the argument to the other person. Dissent remains a useful commodity. However pointless, ineffective and landlocked the process of pointing out the flaws and contradictions may have become, it is necessary to keep doing so. Qatar 2022 was a dictator show that simply sailed above the criticisms. But someone, however minor, has to make them, to offer at least some kind of counter-view.No-platforming an autocrat’s show makes no sense on a basic level. These people would prefer you weren’t there in any case. Whereas in reality the people platforming and enabling Trump and Infantino are not journalists trying to give another version of events, but the people who keep voting them into power, friendly dictators, subservient football associations and client media who will be present whatever happens.View image in fullscreenRumours of raids outside the stadiums at the Club World Cup by ICE, the US immigration agency, has added a sinister tone to the tournament.Photograph: Jonathan Alcorn/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockFifa and its Saudi-backed broadcast partner Dazn are glossing up an army of in-house influencers and content-wanglers to generate a wall of approving noise. Is it healthy if these are the only voices at the show? Shouting into a void may have little effect. But you still have to shout.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is why it is coveted, courted and used like a weapon. Last week these pages carnied alogical, entirely legitimate wider view, written by two academics from City University New York, which concluded that a boycott was not just an option but “necessary”.At the same time, the article defined the football World Cup as something that basically has no value, “spectacles of recreation designed to distract people from their day-to-day lives, cultural and political branding opportunities for their hosts. For authoritarians, they have long been used as a tool to distract from or launder stains of human rights violations and corruption.”Which is definitely true. But it also reads like a vision of sport defined by the most joyless version of AI invented. Under this version of events no World Cup or Olympics would have taken place, because they are essentially worthless, home only to malevolent actors, lacking any notion of colour, human spirt, joy, art, beauty or connection.Who knows, maybe this is accurate now. It is undeniably true that the idea of football as a collective people’s game is fairly absurd. Fans of football clubs struggle with this state of cognitive dissonance on a daily basis, the contrast of legacy identity and hard commercial reality. Liverpool are a community club owned by a US hedge fund. Manchester City see themselves as outsiders and underdogs, and are also owned by the Abu Dhabi royal family. Football is the enemy these days.But both sides of this are important, because without that emotional connection, without the act of faith that enables the warm, human part, everything becomes diminished, all our institutions toxic shells. To give up is to abandon sport for ever to the dictators and the sales people, to say, yeah, this just belongs to you now. No-platforming something that still means connection and culture and history. Are we ready for that yet? There will be another version of the present at some point.View image in fullscreenDespite the political issues surrounding the tournament, some of the games in the Club World Cup so far have had good atmospheres.Photograph: Jae C Hong/APThe final point is about the US, a deeply divided and unhappy place right now, and a much-derided host nation, not least by members of its own populace. What has it been like here? The evidence is that an actual World Cup is going to be very hard to negotiate, spread over vast spaces, with baffling travel times, unreliable infrastructure, and a 24-hour attention industry that is already busy gorging on every other spectacle available to the human race.The US has a reputation for peerless razzmatazz around public events. And while this is undeniably true with cultural spectacles it invented – rock’n’roll, presidential races, galactic shopping malls, enormous food, rural tornadoes, its own continental-scale sports – the US’s version of other people’s specialities, from cheese to professional football, can seem a little mannered.But the fact remains the actual games have been quite good. There has been a European-flavoured focus on tickets and empty seats. But 25,000 people on a weekday to watch Chelsea in an ill-defined game is decent evidence of willingness to stage this thing and develop the market.The dismay at 3,500 turning up to Mamelodi Sundowns v Ulsan HD in Orlando overlooks the upside, the fact that 3,500 people actually turned up to Mamelodi Sundowns v Ulsan HD in Orlando. Sundowns get 9,000-odd even at home. How many of their South African fans can afford to travel for this? Fifa, which uses its faux-benevolence cleverly, will point out an African team received $2m (£1.7m) for winning that game. Do we want to develop something or not?A wider point is that football here is a game beloved of immigrant populations. There is a different kind of warmth, often among people without a platform or the means to make it to the matches so far. The waiter who adores Cristiano Ronaldo. The taxi driver who wants to talk for 40 minutes about Chelsea’s wastefulness with academy players. The cop who loves the Colombian national team and is desperate for his son to see them in the flesh.As for the US itself, it still feels like false equivalence to state that this is now an actual dictatorship, a lost land, a place that doesn’t deserve this show because of its flaws and structural violence. This has always been a pretty brutal nation, human life as a constant pressure wave, mainlining heat and light into your veins, but also always taking a bite.The opening week in Miami captured this feeling, football’s most hungrily transactional event staged on a sunken green peninsula, a place where the sea seems to be punching holes in the land, but which is still constantly throbbing with life and warmth and beautiful things.View image in fullscreenEmpty seats at lots of stadiums have become a prominent issue during the Club World Cup.Photograph: Mike Segar/ReutersThere is a nostalgic attachment to the idea of the US for people of a certain age, 20th-century holdovers, brought up on its flaws and imperialism, but also its culture and brilliance. But for the visitor America does seem in a worse state than it did 20 years ago. There is an unhappiness, a more obvious underclass, a sense of neglected parts and surfaces. All the things that were supposed to be good – cars, plenitude, markets, voting, empowerment, civil rights, cultural unity, all the Cokes being good and all the Cokes being the same – seem to have gone bad.But this is also a democracy with an elected leader, albeit one with a lust for executive power and some sinister tendencies. Mainly the US seems to have a massive self-loathing problem. Perhaps you can say it is correct in this, that Trump is enacting actual harms. But Trump is also a symptom of that alienation and perceived decline. He’s an algorithm-driven apparition. Say his name enough times and this cartoon will appear. America remains a great, messy, dangerous, flawed idea of a place. What else is the world currently offering?This is in any case where football will now live for the next year, an unquestioning supplicant in the form of its own autocratic leader. The game is not an indestructible product. It can be stretched thin and ruined by greed, is already at war with itself in many key places. It will at some point be necessary to pay the ferryman, even as the US is packed away a year from now and the sails set at Fifa House for all corners of the globe and then Saudi Arabia. However stormy the prospects, it is not quite the moment to abandon this ship for good.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupFifaDonald TrumpGianni InfantinoFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

To English football fans with particularly sharp memories, they are the former Middlesbrough and Derby youngsters who left to play in the MLS. To each other, Seb Hines and Giles Barnes are just old mates, stretching back to their days sharing a room on England youth international camps.“It brings an unwavering trust. We can challenge each other and there’s no ill intent behind it,” is how Barnes sums up the benefits of a head coach and his assistant being longtime friends. Yet the unlikely chain of events that led to their reunion in Florida is almost as improbable as Orlando Pride leaping from 10th placeto the titlein two years.Hannah Hampton aims to live up to Mary Earps’ legacy as England No 1Read moreHines may never have moved to the US had it not been for a call to Barnes. When Hines was contemplating leaving Middlesbrough in 2015, it was Barnes – playing for Houston Dynamo at the time – who helped make up his mind.“I asked Giles: ‘What’s the lifestyle like? Is it right for my family? And what’s the standard like?’ And he sold it to me. He said: ‘This is a growing league. You get to play against some of the best players in the world.’ Maybe if I hadn’t had that conversation, I might be stacking shelves in England or something,” says Hines, who knew he had made the right choice on making his Orlando City debut in front of 62,510 alongside Kaká.Barnes’s ownlife-changing move to the MLShad come three years earlier, after a string of serious injuries while at Doncaster after spells at West Brom and his initial breakthrough at Derby.“As a young kid I had a lot going for me. Then I got injured pretty severely to the point where I was told to retire,” Barnes says. “After I came back from knee surgery, I snapped my Achilles twice.“When I was playing for Doncaster, I wasn’t enjoying football and it was purely because I didn’t feel like the same player. I was still young and there were still all these expectations. I never really recovered properly from my injury and that sat with me in a dark place for a long time. I didn’t feel football in my body any more. I was a bit heartbroken. I came to the end of that season and I told my dad I was done with football.View image in fullscreenGiles Barnes (left) and Seb Hines with the NWSL shield and championship trophies Orlando Pride won last season.Photograph: Jeremy Reper/Orlando Pride“I sat on the couch for I don’t know how long and then I got a random phone call from an agent saying: ‘How do you feel about playing for LA Galaxy?’ and I thought: ‘OK you’ve got my attention’. I ended up going to Houston and just enjoying my life, in a new city where no one’s asking: ‘What happened to Giles Barnes, the wonder kid?’ and I could just enjoy football. I started to feel a little better in myself when I started to get the love back for football. I came to MLS in a dark time of my life and in my career and it saved me.”Barnes would go on toplay for Jamaicaand have spells in Canada, Mexico and India before getting a break in coaching after the former USA manager Bob Bradley invited him to join Toronto FC during pre-season while in Florida his old roommate’s own coaching career was set for an unexpected twist.Hines had been working in the backroom staff at Orlando Pride when, in 2022, the NWSL club placed theirhead coach, Amanda Cromwell, on leaveand Hines was promoted to interim head coach.Cromwell was later sackedafter “engaging in retaliatory conduct” towards players who had complained against her in a previous investigation.The team needed a reset and Hines knew who to call. “It was a no-brainer to bring Giles in,” Hines says. “We started out with the culture. We made training fun and enjoyable, but hard work as well. We have to make sure it’s enjoyable because you can’t hate playing football, it’s the best job in the world.”Barnes says: “It was simple – I wanted to help him, he’s such a good guy. I did have some questions, because the club had been in a little bit of turmoil, they’d had a lot of investigations, and I was just like: ‘Seb, what’s it going to take?’ and he said: ‘We need to just get the culture right and it will be good’.

The investment from the ownership group has been tremendous, really trusting us. Everything has come together nicely, on an upward trajectory. Now it’s about trying to sustain success and it not just being a one-off. We’ve set a standard and expectation now.”Rose Lavelle returns as Emma Hayes names domestic-heavy roster for US friendliesRead moreHines had already madeNWSLhistory by becoming the league’s first Black head coach, something that surprised him. “I didn’t know until I got the job. The league had been going for [more than] 10 years so it came as a bit of a shock. You would like to see a lot more Black coaches or minorities getting those opportunities to be successful in multiple leagues and I want to be a role model and to make sure everyone can have the same aspirations.”A former England youth captain, Hines worked under two England managers, Steve McClaren and Gareth Southgate, at Middlesbrough as well as the former Scotland manager Gordon Strachan and Tony Mowbray – “He was great for me, he trusted me and helped me develop” – and finally Aitor Karanka. “It’s not a bad list of coaches,” Hines says. “I’ve been able to take little pieces away from them which I’ve tried to implement here.”As the NWSL approaches its halfway break – for the Euros – Orlando Pride sit second in the table. Barnes says: “It’s not just about winning one championship. It’s ‘can you win another one?’” Barnes and Hines have no intention of stopping.Explore more on these topicsNWSLWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 51-year-old guided Forest to a seventh-place finish inthe Premier Leaguethis past season, securing European qualification for the first time since 1995-96.For much of the campaign, it looked as though Forest would qualify for the Champions League, but they lost five of their last eight games. However, that has not prevented the club’s owner, Evangelos Marinakis, from rewarding Nuno after the club’s highest league finish for 30 years, while they also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup before losing to Manchester City.Confident, ambitious, serious – the Nuno effect is taking Forest into dreamlandRead moreNuno said: “I am delighted to be able to continue our journey at this fantastic football club. Since we arrived at Forest, we have worked extremely hard to create a special bond between the players, the fans and everyone at the club, which helped us achieve great things last season.“I would like to thank our owner, Mr Marinakis, for his constant support and backing. It is important to me to share a strong relationship with our ownership and we have thoroughly enjoyed working together ever since I arrived at Forest. Now is the time to work harder than ever as we strive for more special memories together.”The former Wolves and Tottenham manager arrived at the City Ground in December 2023 after the sacking of Steve Cooper, and helped the club avoid relegation on the final day of that season.Marinakis said: “Nuno has made a great impact and performed very well during his time with us so far. He has demonstrated that he maximises player performance and is an expert at developing players, whilst also embedding our young talent into the first-team setup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He did so by dealing with Jasprit Bumrah, the world’s best bowler, in glorious form and by coping with the worst batting conditions of the game tocompile his ninth Test century, sealed in the final moments of an extended day, with celebrations both in the middle and in England’s dressing room.Pope resists Bumrah to lift England after bowlers claw control away from IndiaRead moreDuckett, who by the time Pope raised his bat was watching from the players’ balcony having scored 62, described his “goosebumps” when Pope scored the single he required to tick into triple figures minutes before stumps.“He was just so calm coming out,” Duckett said. “He probably couldn’t come out in tougher conditions, with Jasprit Bumrah running down the hill with the lights on. I don’t know what’s inside his head, but he’s just stayed true to the way he plays, and there’s no better feeling than that, scoring a hundred against that attack, coming out in the first over. You could see it in the way he celebrated, and it didn’t just mean a lot to him, it meant a huge amount in the dressing room as well. I had goosebumps for him.”View image in fullscreenBen Duckett takes the applause after reaching a half century.Photograph: Alan Martin/Colorsport/ShutterstockSpeculation about Pope’s place in the team had persisteddespite his 171in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe last month, though the quality and importance of his latest century, given the match situation when he emerged – England 467 behind and Zak Crawley having been dismissed off the final ball of the first over, by an extraordinary and utterly unplayable delivery from Bumrah – will surely silence the sceptics for a while at least.“We’re very good at keeping things in the dressing room, but obviously you can hear the noise from outside of it,” Duckett said. “There’s noise outside the dressing room but there’s no noise in it. We’re not having discussions about who’s going to play. The way Pope has dealt with that has just been superb and just sums up and proves why he’s England’s No 3 and doing the things that he’s doing.”The mesmerising Bumrah took all three of the English wickets to fall – including snaring Joe Root with the ball after Pope’s century celebrations – and also had Harry Brook caught at midwicket in the final over of the day only for the umpire to signal a no-ball, while India dropped three catches to allow England to reach 209 for three at stumps, still trailing by 262.“He’s the best bowler in the world,” Duckett said of Bumrah. “He’s extremely hard to face. He’s good in any conditions, and when he’s coming in down the hill with the lights on and it’s swinging both ways, it’s tough. Just his ability to bowl three or four different balls with no cue – you don’t know if he’s bowling a bouncer, or a slow ball, a yorker, an away-swinger or an inswinger until it comes out of his hand. You’ve got to watch the ball so hard with him.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was expecting better than that, but it can happen. After 430 for three you expect to get a big score, because you’re sitting on a comfortable position, but after losing the toss it was very good. Headingley normally on day one a lot of wickets get taken by the bowling side, so I think we batted well.”Josh Tongue took four of the last five, to demonstrate why Duckett’s nickname for him is so apposite. “I call him the mop, for mopping up the tails at the end,” Duckett said.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

The hosts were still some way from flipping the advantage they had handed India but by stumps, after an earlier fightback with the ball, Ollie Pope’s unbeaten 100 had established something akin to a foothold in the contest.Pope came into this Test with questions being asked about his spot at No 3; questions that centred around a poor record against India and Australia and not quelled bythat 171 against Zimbabwe. Jacob Bethell, flavour of the month in New Zealand late last year, was breathing down his neck, even if potential, rather than back catalogue, was the driver.Jasprit Bumrah turns the series into two – when he’s bowling and when he’s not | Andy BullRead moreAnd yet as England closed on 209 for three in reply to India’s 471 all out – a total derailed by a collapse of seven for 41 – Stokes was grateful to his vice-captain for holding firm in the face of a typically electric display by Jasprit Bumrah. It would be wrong to roll out Graham Gooch’s old line about Richard Hadlee – “World XI at one end, Ilford 2nds at the other” – but when Bumrah was on, the smell of wickets hung in the clammy air.View image in fullscreenIndia’s Yashasvi Jaiswal drops Ollie Pope on 60. off the bowling of Jasprit Bumrah.Photograph: Allan McKenzie/SWpix.com/ShutterstockIndia’s remarkable slingshot could easily have had more than his three for 48 from 13 overs, not least the edge that Yashasvi Jaiswal had earlier grassed at slip when Pope was on 60. His day underlined where the crux of this series likely sits but ended with those broad shoulders slumped. Harry Brook, on nought simply tasked with seeing out the final over, was caught playing a wild hook, only for a front-foot no-ball to be called.The Yorkshire faithful could have been forgiven for grumbling about there being “more brains in a pork pie” – a charge that at least could not be laid at Pope. His one life aside, England’s No 3 had been largely equal to his unique challenge of Bumrah and the spikiness of Mohammed Siraj. Emerging after the loss of Zak Crawley sixth ball, and looking in touch from the outset, Pope sent 13 fours cruising along this fast outfield.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Josh Tongue took four wickets for eight runs in 17 balls.Photograph: John Mallett/ProSports/ShutterstockPope looked a bit like a local at times, picking up runs behind square as they tend to do in these parts and sealing his ninth Test century before the close. The celebration was one of pent up frustration being released. But he also needed partners, Ben Duckett making a typically punchy 62 in a stand of 122 runs and Joe Root adding 28 in an alliance worth of 80. Both had early reprieves – Duckett dropped on 15, Root overturning an lbw on seven – and both were ultimately Bumrah’d in the end.It was never going to be straightforward, with India’s collapse either side of lunch as welcome for England as it was potentially ominous. The clouds had rolled over Headingley to start the Dukes ball hooping and only made way in the evening. For Josh Tongue this was simply manna from heaven, day one figures of none for 75 from 16 transformed into four for 86 from 20 courtesy of a rapid demolition of the tail. As Stokes joked in his celebrations, Tongue was devouring some rabbit pie here.View image in fullscreenIndia’s Rishabh Pant celebrates his century in acrobatic style. His wildly entertaining 134 from 178 balls included 12 fours and six sixes.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAAlthough the spark was Shoaib Bashir getting the breakthrough that his performance 24 hours earlier had deserved when Shubman Gill looked to take down the off-spinner on 147 and skewed the ball to deep backward square. Gill and Pant had put on 209 for the fourth wicket, the latter turning his overnight 65 into three figures and celebrating with a superb somersault. Going by the ovation, the locals thought was flippin’ marvellous.Pant sure is an entertainer, his eventual 134 from 178 balls packed with more fun than a day at Disney. And yet for all the tumbling scoops and range hitting into the Western Terrace – 12 fours and six sixes – it was stitched together with watchful defence. This, as much as the mischief, is why only three wicketkeepers – Adam Gilchrist (17), Andy Flower (12) and Les Ames (8) – have scored more than his seven Test centuries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among the three ducks that made it so was poor Karun Nair, who had spent eight years waiting for a Test recall and chipped his fourth delivery from Stokes to a flying Pope at short cover. It really can be a cruel sport at times.Our graphic is for a right-hander, to keep all the wagon wheels consistent, so 88 of his 134 runs came on the leg sideOur graphic is for a right-hander, to keep all the wagon wheels consistent, so 88 of his 134 runs came on the leg side.Tongue knows it all too well, of course, the fast bowler back this summer after an 18-month battle with injuries. Reward for this perseverance came with the eventual removal of Pant, a switch to around the wicket messing up the left-hander’s calibrations and leading to an odd-looking lbw offering no shot. Jamie Smith, who had earlier missed a stumping off Pant when he was on 124, could also breathe a sigh of relief.This was possibly surpassed by those from Duckett and Crawley after Tongue gobbled up his rabbit pie and 40 minutes of rain then intervened. Not that conditions improved much after the restart, Bumrah steaming in under lights, squaring up Crawley in his first over, and seeing an edge fly into the cordon. But on this sticky second day Indian hands lost some of their adhesiveness and Pope wriggled England free.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025India cricket teamEngland cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

After over two furious hours of battle, their form was reflected in the final scoreline as Lehecka toppled a frustrated Draper, the second seed, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 to reach the biggest final of his career, againstCarlos Alcaraz.Draper, who will nonethelessbe among the top four seedsat Wimbledon as a result of this run, had been struggling with his game and apparent illness this week and revealed he had been diagnosed with tonsillitis. Draper competed admirably during the tournament, digging deep to find a way through two tough three-set winsover Alexei Popyrinand Brandon Nakashima before putting himself in position to compete for a first grass-court title. He ends with a crushing result.Nick Kyrgios: ‘If I’d acted a bit differently, I would have had a Wimbledon title’Read more“I’m obviously very gutted,” said Draper. “I gave myself a chance. I could have been out there tomorrow. This is a tournament I have watched since I was young and always really motivated to come here. It hurts a bit more because it’s at home. It isn’t the big one, but every match I lose, I take it really hard.”View image in fullscreenJiri Lehecka has been the outstanding performer at Queen’s Club.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAs Draper’s hopes of competing for his first title on home soil faded in the form of a searing backhand down-the-line winner from Lehecka that secured the decisive break in the third set, his emotions finally boiled over. Draper pounded his racket into the LED screen on the side of the court, temporarily disabling a small rectangular part of the screen. In addition to cracking his racket, Draper grazed his knee. Coincidentally, the screen had been showing an advertisement for Dunlop, his racket sponsor, before it turned black.Draper made no excuses about his tendency to sometimes lose his composure in the heat of battle, but he views it as a part of his intense competitive nature: “When you’re not feeling great, when your energy is really low, you use everything you can to get yourself up,” he said. “I’m almost getting angry to get fired up. When you do that, when you give everything you have, not just in tennis, like in anything, you’re a bit less mellow and playing a bit more on a tightrope. So when you try your best and things don’t go your way, it’s easy to spill over. That’s what happened.“I don’t want to behave like that, but that’s just the way I am as a competitor. Sometimes I just play on a bit of a tightrope. I don’t want to be behaving like that.”Before the semi-finals, Lehecka had been the most impressive performer this week, defeating the fifth seed, Alex de Minaur, in the opening round and then rolling through the rest of the draw. His massive first serve and clean, destructive forehand dominated the first hour of the match. In the decisive final moments deep in the final set, Lehecka outserved Draper and dictated from the baseline.View image in fullscreenJack Draper struggling with the heat at Queens.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAlthough Draper fought impressively and served well to turn the match around, he has struggled with his forehand throughout the week meaning once he lost his service rhythm in his final two service games, he was vulnerable.

No, not at all. I’m in the semi-finals at Queen’s. I’d probably go on court with a broken leg. I wouldn’t have pulled out for anything. So I went out there, gave all I had, and I can be very proud of that.”Quick GuideRoundup: tough draw for Raducanu, Vondrousova vanquishes SabalenkaShowEmma Raducanu has been handed a testing draw at the Eastbourne Open, where she is expected to make a return after managing a back problem that has troubled the British No 1 since she competed in Strasbourg last month, before the French Open.The 2021 US Open champion took an off-court medical timeout during her quarter-final loss to Zheng Qinwen at Queen's Club last week, after which it was confirmed she would miss this week's Berlin Open, having been offered a wildcard.Seeded seventh in the draw for Eastbourne, Raducanu has been drawn against the American Ann Li in the first round, with the two-time Wimbledon runner-up Ons Jabeur her likely second-round opponent.

The Czech, who has been working her way back from shoulder surgery, has seen her ranking drop to 164th. \"I didn't play for a long time. I am just happy to be back healthy, and so grateful to play these matches,\" Vondrousova said on the WTA Tour website.\"When I saw the field here, I was like: 'OK, let's just try to win the first round,' and then, you know, now this is happening.\"The 25-year-old will play Chinese qualifierWang Xinyuin the final.

The French Open champion, who was watched for much of the match by his new mixed doubles partner, Emma Raducanu, produced his best performance of the week here to return to the final with a 6-4, 6-4 win over his veteran countryman Roberto Bautista Agut.After struggling with his serve throughout his marathon second-roundwin against Jaume Munar, Alcaraz served 15 aces against Bautista Agut and struck his forehand brilliantly.

Lazzat, the 9-2 winner, galloped loose around the track for about a quarter of an hour and delayed the presentations after throwing his jockey, James Doyle, shortly after crossing the line.“I did apologise to the king and queen when I went to collect my prize,” Doyle said, “and said I should have stayed in Pony Club a bit longer than I did. We had a good laugh about that.”Parades, picnics and parasols: Royal Ascot 2025 – in picturesRead moreIt had already been a good meeting for Doyle, with three winners for his main employer, the increasingly powerful Wathnan Racing operation, but a Group One win on a horse bought to join Wathnan less than a month ago took his week to a new level.Lazzat was quickly away and soon leading a group of 10 horses racing down the middle of the track. While the Japanese hope Satono Reve, backed down to start favourite at 2-1, fired a serious challenge at him in the final furlong under João “Magic Man” Moreira, Lazzat was a half-length in front at the line, with another recent Wathnan purchase, Flora Of Bermuda, another three lengths away in third.“It’s been an amazing week and that has capped it off,” Richard Brown, Wathnan’s racing manager, said. “What an amazing horse race, he’s locked up with the Japanese horse and they’ve gone a long way clear in a six-furlong sprint. That was an absolutely phenomenal race to watch.“When you saw him [Satono Reve] come in, he’s a monster walking round here but that is a very, very brave performance. That’s two brilliant rides from James from the front.” Doyle had won the opening Chesham Stakes on Humidity.Japan’s wait for a firstRoyal Ascotwinner goes on. Satono Reve ran a fine race to finish a half-length second, but he raced in a group of five runners near the stand rail as Lazzat led a larger group in the middle of the track.

The most dependable and high-achieving horse in the yard delivered for his trainer when he needed it with a one-and-three-quarter-length defeat of Al Riffa.William Buick sent Rebel’s Romance to the front well over a furlong out and the seven-times Group One winner stayed on strongly all the way to the line. He will now attempt to win an eighth Group One, taking his prize money earnings past £11m in the process, in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over the same course and distance next month.“I’ve got a picture of this fellow on my bedside table, he means that much to us all,” Appleby said. “Full credit to the horse first and foremost, and full credit to all the team.

To win with them is just a bonus.”As a gelding, Rebel’s Romance’s racing career is relatively open-ended and after the King George, the seven-year-old is likely to be aimed towards an attempt to become the first three-time winner of the Breeders’ Cup Turf.“He’s kept the whole yard afloat this week and you just don’t come across these horses often in your career,” Appleby said. “He’s our stable favourite and always will be.”Ryan Moore, who rode Sober to victory in the concluding Queen Alexandra Stakes, finished the week as the meeting’s leading jockey for the 12th time with seven winners, while John & Thady Gosden, who tied with Aidan O’Brien on five winners after both drew a blank on Saturday, won the trainers’ award thanks to one more runner-up.The trainers’ award has now been won by either the O’Brien or Gosden stable at the past 11 Royal meetings.Explore more on these topicsRoyal AscotHorse racing tipsHorse racingAscotnewsShareReuse this content"

Along the way Kane also scored one, made one and walked off with the Superior Player Of the Match laurels asBayern Munichedged their way to a relentlessly entertaining 2-1 defeat of Boca Juniors in front of a high-energy full house.As a result, Bayern are now though to the knockout stage of theClub World Cup. A European team has also finally beaten a South American opponent at this tournament. But defeat still leaves Boca in effect in charge of their own destiny, with the fall-guys of Auckland City to come. They basically need to win by a spectacular margin and rely on Bayern to beat Benfica.Flamengo stun Chelsea with comeback victory at Club World Cup as Jackson sees redRead moreThere had been a lot of talk before this game about a night of full-contact combat in store for Bayern’s attack and midfield. The central defender Lauturo Di Lollo had been asked ahead of this tournament how he planned to cope with Kane, and replied: “I’m going to kill him.” It was meant as a joke. Probably. But there was an excellent opportunity to test this from kick-off as Di Lollo started in central defence right up against his intended victim.The opening hour was something of a controlled suffocation as Bayern kept the ball and took the lead. But Boca dragged their way back into this game, blocking shots, hurling themselves into contact and equalising in the second half, before finding ultimately that Bayern just had too much quality in the clinches.This was a rare 9pm kick-off, a much more sensible piece of scheduling in south Florida, by which time the heat has generally transitioned from Nordic sauna on the surface of the planet Venus levels to merely very hot and humid. It felt like a proper football match from two hours before kick-off as the vast shimmering surrounds of the Hard Rock Stadium were thronged with red, blue and yellow.This was a meeting of boisterous, alpha clubs, perhaps even distant cousins on Bavaria-La Plata continuum: domestic powerhouses, rousing music, regional meat culture. Although their only previous competitive meeting was the infamous 2001 Intercontinental Cup Final, which Bayern won 1-0. Among Boca fans that game is still remembered as the Robbery of the Century because of an allegedly dubious second yellow card awarded to Chelo Delgado.View image in fullscreenMiguel Merentiel celebrates with Boca Juniors fans after scoring a stunning solo goal against Bayern Munich.Photograph: Patrícia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty ImagesIt doesn’t look like a robbery now, with the benefit of YouTube hindsight. It looks like a stunningly beautiful through pass from Juan Roman Riquelme, followed by a very obvious dive. But there is at least a reassuring universality in the reactions of football supporters to such things.The Hard Rock Stadium was a Friday night sell-out from the start, packed to the far reaches of the upper tiers beneath the vast steel lattice roof. The ludicrous WWE-style player walk-ons once again ate up four minutes of everyone’s life that they’ll never get back. This must be stopped. Nobody anywhere in the world needs to hear the words “KONRAD LAIMER!” in a throaty scream across the stadium PA, while an embarrassed-looking Konrad Laimer walks out slowly across a piece of grass towards a lineup of bored-looking teammates.Bayern kicked off with Michael Olise, Serge Gnabry and Kingsley Coman behind Kane, and the familiar Goretzka-Kimmich double pivot in midfield. Jonathan Tah, a new addition in central defence, also started here, aged 29 and a well-worn Bundesliga figure.Not much happened for a while as Bayern kept the ball comfortably. And Kane opened the scoring on 18 minutes, a nice finish after a sightly heavy first touch, easing the ball into the bottom corner, off the studs of his left boot. The ball had fallen to him from a deflection off Coman as he challenged for a cross. Kane was unspectacularly in the right place.View image in fullscreenMichael Olise celebrates with Bayern Munich teammates after scoring a late goal against Boca Juniors.Photograph: Lynne Sladky/APThomas Tuchel was watching all this from the plush Fifa seats. Kane scoring in America, late June, South American defence, full house. This felt like good optics, a vibe, something packed away.Bayern had dominated every metric to that point, with 74% possession, 101 passes to 29, three shots and two corners to zero and zero. This has been the way Boca have played here, an attacking plan based on swift collective breaks. It involves a lot of waiting, a lot of singing in the stands while the opposition pass across the face of a low, muscular block.Boca had their first shot, a veering drive from a free-kick by Kevin Zenon that Manuel Neuer double-fisted away in the Continental Style. And Neuer made a very good save moments later, batting away with his left hand as Zenon shot again from a similar angle.It was a good game by now. Luis Advincula was booked for the latest in a series of conga-style hip-grabs on Coman as he spun away. Kane was taken out by Costa, left crumpled and clutching his ankle after a hip-swivelling full body block.Boca began to emerge from their defensive crouch after half-time, although this coincided with a little extra space at the other end. Kane shot just over after good work from Gnabry. Olise, who played inside his own portable pocket of air all night, eased about radiating menace.Club World Cup didn’t start the fire – it didn’t light it but we’ll try to fight it | Max RushdenRead moreBut it was Boca who began to wrench at the throttle. And they equalised on 67 minutes with an excellent goal from Miguel Merentiel. It came from a break close to the halfway line. A fine through pass from Alan Velasco inside Tah left Rentier with space in front of him. Tah had no chance, treading through heavy water as Merentiel sniped in on goal then lifted his finish past Neuer.The Hard Rock Stadium erupted, the bodies tumbling in the stands, drinks thrown, scarves twirled, a vast roar barrelling from one Boca end to the other Boca end. But it was Bayern who managed to rev up through the gears again, despite the worrying sight of Jamal Musiala, a second-half sub, limping off injured once again.With seven minutes left Olise scored the winner, shooting low into a corner after a really smart little touch from Kane, finding just enough order out of a scramble and a press of bodies to nudge the ball back into Olise’s path. So Bayern can rest and tend to their bruises for the final group game against Benfica. The amateurs of Auckland will be bracing themselves for next Tuesday night at Geodis Park in Nashville, Tennessee.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupBayern MunichBoca JuniorsUS sportsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "TechnologyDo electric vehicles make people more carsick?An increasing number of people are experiencing motion sickness in EVs, and there is a scientific explanation as to whyJess ThomsonSat 21 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTShareView image in fullscreenIllustration: The Guardian/Charles DesmaraisWith electric cars skyrocketing in popularity around the world – in 2024,22% of new car salesworldwide were electric vehicles, compared with 18% in 2023 – a growing body of studies and an increasing number of people have found that they feel more motion sick riding in EVs than in traditional petrol or diesel cars. Anecdotes offeeling sickin the passenger or back seat of electric cars littersocial media, as doquestionsfrom wary prospective buyers.There is a scientific explanation behind why a person might feel more sick in an EV, though, according to multiple academic studies.“Greater sickness in EVs can be attributed to a lack of previous experience, as both a driver and as a passenger, where the brain lacks accuracy in estimating the motion forces because it relies on previous experience in other types of cars,” said William Emond, a PhD student researching car sickness at the Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard in France.The Cybertruck was supposed to be apocalypse-proof. Can it even survive a trip to the grocery store?Read moreThough EVs are becoming more popular, combustion cars still dominate. Riders have a longer history with gas cars and so have had more time to adapt to their specific cues. If a person has spent most of their life driving a combustion engine car, their brain anticipates acceleration after the rev of the engine, a warning that they are about to experience a change in speed. In a battery-powered car, the electric motor makes no such noises.In addition to general unfamiliarity, research has found links between specific features common to electric vehicles and motion sickness. One2024 studyconcluded that there were strong correlations between motion sickness severity and the seat vibrations of electric vehicles, while a2020 studyfound that the lack of engine sound in an EV might be a major contributing factor to increased feelings of carsickness.“If we are accustomed to traveling in non-EVs, we are used to understanding the car’s motion based on signals such as engine revs, engine vibrations, torque, etc. Yet, traveling in an EV for the first time is a new motion environment for the brain, which needs adaptation,” Emond explains.Additionally, the regenerative braking technology used in EVs – where the motor converts the slowing car’s kinetic energy into electricity that then is stored in the battery – results inlow-frequency deceleration, meaning that the vehicle slows down gradually and steadily, over a relatively longer period, rather than rapidly or in quick pulses. Such low-frequency deceleration tends to be associated withhigher levels of motion sickness.A2024 studysuggested the feature acted as one of the main triggers of motion sickness in electric vehicles. The study’s authors wrote: “Our results confirmed that higher levels of RB [regenerative braking] can induce MS [motion sickness].”Motion sickness is thought to be caused by a mismatch between various sensory signals the brain simultaneously receives about the body’s movement. Specifically, it happens when the inner ear, which helps control balance, the eyes, and the body send conflicting information to the brain.“Better knowledge on self-motion allows us to anticipate motion forces, which is crucial for motion sickness. Yet, when the motion forces as estimated or anticipated by the brain differ from what actually is experienced, then the brain interprets this ‘neural mismatch’ as a situation of conflict,” Emond said. “If this conflict persists over time, it may surpass a threshold for triggering autonomic reactions of the body such as symptoms apparent to ‘motion sickness’.”Being able to anticipate the movement of a vehicle appears to be integral to the experience of motion sickness, which is why people who are driving a car don’t tend to experience symptoms. They know what is coming.The interplay between anticipation of motion and actual motion experienced may be why EVs are associated with worse motion sickness, as these vehicles provide fewer clues regarding upcoming movements.“When discovering a new motion environment, the brain needs to habituate because there is no knowledge of previous experience in such a context. This is, for example, why almost everyone becomes sick in zero-gravity environments,” Emond says.As EV ownership continues to increase, some researchers are already looking into a solution for the cars’ specific type of nausea. Several research papers have suggested that motion sickness in autonomous EVs could be treated byusing visualsignals, such as interactive screens and ambient lighting, orvibrational cuesto allow a passenger’s brain to anticipate motion changes, alleviating the lurching feeling in the back of an electric taxi."

For more than a decade he was in the living rooms of millions of Americans most weeks, picking winners, barking his judgment. Viewers did not see the squadrons of producers, camera operators, sound people, makeup artists, fixers and fawners. Truthiness trumps honesty as most of us understand the concept of accuracy.As a nearly 80-year-old, DJT has instinctively absorbed the lessons of television all his life. While others struggled to make sense of communications scholar Marshall McLuhan’s theory that “the medium is the message”, he lived it. He strove to be an influencer before the term was invented; he was, and continues to be, theultimate product placement. The sneers of others fed him.Fibs and exaggeration have always been part of politics – but who knows what lies are now being pushed online? | Julianne SchultzRead moreFor all the talk about the power of social media, Elon Musk, learned at his expense that while his platform is great for proclamations, self-promotion and advertising, its narrative power still does not match the ingrained habits of television storytelling. “I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far,” he posted, waving a white flag on X.Meanwhile, the rest of us nodded sagely, we knew this would happen, pass the popcorn, enjoy the show.Except this is not a show, even though the logic of television we have all grown up with encourages us to think it is. The man at its centre has the capacity, literally, to destroy the world.This fact that no doubt lingered in the minds of other world leaders as he made a typically attention-winning departure from the G7 Canadian summit last week. Hequickly slapped down the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who with typical candour, suggested the president had left to broker peace in the Middle East.Like all stars, DJT also has an enormous capacity to charm. Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic who did enormous (temporary) damage to the new regime when he revealed he had been included in a classified group chat on Signal organised by Mike Waltz, who not long afterwards ceased to be the president’s national security adviser. Goldberg describes a subsequent meeting in thegilded Oval Office: “What I found on this particular meeting was a Trump who was low-key, attentive and eager to convince us that he is good at his job and good for the country. It isn’t easy to escape the tractor beam of his charisma, but somehow we managed.”While a young DJT was absorbing the lessons of the age of television in midtown Manhattan, 50 blocks south, Neil Postman, a brilliant scholar at New York University, feared where this new manufactured reality might lead. In his erudite, yet snappily titled treatise, Amusing Ourselves to Death, Postman described the way the methods of television had transformed, and in his mind debased, the public sphere. Entertainment and emotion prevail; the worst tendencies in human nature pandered to; truthiness is enough.Postman had little objection to television as entertainment, what worried him was when these methods and rituals were also adopted in news and current affairs, in the serious programs that provide the information that inform big decisions. As we would say now, nuance and complexity are lost.He turned time and again to Aldous Huxley to make sense of what he feared was unfolding. “He was trying to tell us that what afflicted the people in Brave New World was not that they were laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know what they were laughing about and why they had stopped thinking.”Australians have soundly rejected Trump-style culture wars. Now Albanese must act with courage and vision | Julianne SchultzRead moreWe are the poorer for not knowing what Postman would make of this moment. He died a year before the first season of The Apprentice went to air in 2004, with “decent ratings and mocking reviews”. DJT took an elevator 21 floors down to the pretend boardroom on the fourth floor of Trump Tower, where contestants who had been set tasks to rescue his failing enterprises awaited his judgment.As Emily Nussbaum documents in Cue the Sun, at that point no one understood how he would use the platform as a stepping stone to his grander ambition. When he did, one of the early apprentices urged voters to look beyond the artifice of television and recognise the risk.Celebrity was transformed into a vocation. The real world a B-roll backdrop.Australian networks were quick to adopt the formats of reality television, in the process creating some of the best in the genre. Our Housewives of … are considered some of the greatest, and Alone has restored a lost sense of authenticity.Despite Pauline Hanson dancing with the stars, there is still a line between public life and entertainment. But it is getting fuzzier as the attention seeking demands of the contemporary online media environment reward froth and emotion more than substance. Preserving this distinction between real and make-believe is more important than ever.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of Australia, the co-editor ofFirst Things First (Griffith Review)and the librettist of the multi-award-winning opera Black RiverExplore more on these topicsMediaOpinionReality TVDonald TrumpTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

The 40-year-old billionaire founder and CEO of the messaging app Telegram revealed last year–in a post on his own app– that while he isn’t married and prefers to live alone, he has over 100 biological children in 12 countries via sperm donation.Durov’s reproductive choices madeheadlinesagain this week after the tech tycoon told the French political magazineLe Pointthat he is going to leave his fortune, estimated at almost $14bn, to all of his children. Durov has six children he fathered naturally with three different partners as well as the children he has via sperm donation.“They are all my children and will all have the same rights. I don’t want them to tear each other apart after my death,” he told Le Point.What possessed Durov, who wascharged last year in Franceover allegations that Telegram is being used for illicit activity, to populate the world with so many mini-mes? (Hehas denied failing to cooperatewith authorities and Telegram has denied having poor moderation.) Well, like Elon Musk and a number of other tech types, Durov is a pronatalist who is worried about global fertility rates declining. He’s chosen to take a hands-on approach to tackling the issue, fundingfree IVF treatmentsfor women at AltraVita IVF Clinic inMoscowfor anyone who uses his sperm. If you’re interested, and I’m sure that a lot of people will be now that Durov has laid out the terms of his will, he’s still gotsperm on ice at the clinic.Durov first donated his sperm over 15 years ago, in order to help a friend. Then, he said in hisTelegrampost last year, he realised he ought to donate more widely. “The boss of the clinic told me that ‘high quality donor material’ was in short supply and that it was my civic duty to donate more sperm to anonymously help more couples,” Durov said in the post. Durov added that he wants to “help destigmatize the whole notion of sperm donation and incentivize more healthy men to do it.”Having used a sperm donor to conceive my own child, I’m all for destigmatizing sperm donation. Particularly as there is amajor lack of sperm donorsamong certain demographics: at one point last year, for example, there were only adozen Black sperm donorsat the four main cryobanks in the US.But, and this is a very bigbut,there is an enormous difference between destigmatizing artificial insemination and one person thinking it is their “civic duty” to conceive 100-plus children. Allowing a single individual to procreate so prolifically raises complex ethical issues. There’s the possibility of accidental incest in the future, as well as the potential psychological impact that stems from someone discovering they have 100 siblings. There are also potential medical problems:earlier this year it was reportedthat the sperm of a man with a rare cancer-causing mutation was used to conceive at least 67 children.Is Durov even allowed to donate to so many different couples? The short answer is yes. The law regarding how many children can be conceived from one donor is complicated and varies from country to country. In places like France there are strict national limits while in the US (and Russia) there is no national law limiting the number of donations one person can make. Reputable cryobanks, however, do claim to have their own self-imposed limits. The European Sperm Bank applies aworldwide limitof 75 families for each sperm donor. California Cryobank, one of the largest providers in the US, has said it tries to limit donations toabout 25-30 families.However these cryobanks are also extremelyexpensive, particularly after the pandemic, when shortages meant spermflation kicked in, and there is a completely unregulated market for sperm via Facebook groups and private websites where people can match with potential donors. This has allowed unscrupulous people like Jonathan Jacob Meijer of the Netherlands tofather hundreds of children.As artificial insemination becomes more common, there is a desperate need to better regulate the industry and limit the number of children conceived from a single sperm donor. Indeed, Sweden, along with seven other countries including Belgium,raised the topicwith EU ministers this week. “This issue has been left unresolved for too long,”an official from Belgiumtold POLITICO, adding that an “international limit is a first step in the right direction.”Let’s hope that these limits get put in place sooner rather than later. Because I have an inkling that Elon Musk, who seems to be going alittle off the rails, might take all the chatter about Durov’s progeny as a personal challenge.New Rio law requires public hospitals to display anti-abortion signsThese include messages like: “Did you know that the unborn child is discarded as hospital waste?”The Guardian reportsthat this is the “latest example of a growing trend acrossBrazilto further restrict access to abortion in a country that already has some of the world’s most restrictive laws”.Melanoma cases rise in women under 50The caveat here is that overdiagnosis could be contributing to this increasing.Per Axios, one study “found that routine skin exams have increased and pathologists now more often classify ambiguous lesions as melanoma”.

There, he shot Hoffman nine times, critically wounding him, and shot his wife eight times as,relatives say, she threw her body over her daughter to shield her. He next drove to the home of the former house speakerMelissa Hortman, forced his way in, and killed her and her husband, officials say.The police arrived and Boelter fled, abandoning his car. In it they allegedly discovered a “kill list” of dozens offederal and state Democratic officials, mostly from Minnesota but also prominent Democrats in other midwestern states, and the sites of women’s healthcare centers and Planned Parenthood donors. He left behind notebooks with detailed descriptions of his target locations. On the lam, Boelter sent atext messageto his family: “Dad went to war last night.”As soon as the earliest reports of the murders were published, with the sketchy information that Boelter had been appointed by Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, to one of many state boards, on which there are currently more than 342 vacancies, therightwing swarm began spreading the falsehoodthat he was Walz’s hitman. Mike Cernovich, a notorious conspiracy-monger with a large following on X,tweeted: “Did Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?”A US senator’s X posts after the Minnesota shootings were horrific – and predictable | Austin SaratRead moreElon Musk jumped in, writing on X: “The far left is murderously violent.” The far-right activistLaura Loomer, who occasionally surfaces as an intimate of Donald Trump,tweetedthat Boelter and Walz were “friends” and that Walz should be “detained” by the FBI.Within hours, Mike Lee, a Republican senator for Utah, used the platform of his office to push the disinformation. Over eerie night-time photos of Boelter in his mask and police outfit standing at Hortman’s door seconds before he opened fire, Lee tweeted, first at 9.50am on 15 June: “This is what happens. When Marxists don’t get their way.” At 10.15am, he tweeted, “Nightmare on Waltz Street,” misspelling Walz’s name.Lee expressed no sympathy or shock over the assassinations. He assumed the distance of the online tormentor gave him license. Like the mask-wearer, both were disinhibited by their contrived personas. Anything goes. Lee was doing more than blaming Walz for carrying out a bloody vendetta that conspiracy theorists had conjured. Lee created a cartoon. The killer was enlisted by the evil liberal governor to rub out someone who was in reality one of his closest allies. Like Boelter, Lee felt a compulsion to push himself in. The clamor of the far right pre-empted the emergence of the facts for Lee and served as his incitement.But, of course, Lee is a learned man who knew that what he was doing was malicious. The facts were always irrelevant. He trivialized a tragedy in order to implicate Walz as the villain commissioning the hit. Lee’s tone was one of mocking derision to belittle and distort. The killer, Walz and the victims were all tiny, dehumanized figures he arranged to illustrate his tweets. His manipulation was more than a maneuver. It was a revelation of Lee’s own mentality and political imagination he believed would be embraced to his advantage. His depraved humor was designed to cement fellow feeling between the jokester and his intended audience. He was playing to the gallery that he knew how to own the libs. He would gain approval and acceptance. In the hothouse in which he operates, he thought his mindless cruelty passed as wit.Soon enough it was reported that Boelter was not a Marxist or for that matter a hitman hired by Marxists. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that Walz “did not know him” and Walz was on his “kill list”. Boelterwas reportedlyan abortion opponent, an evangelical Christian and a registered Republican who attended Trump rallies.Mike Lee is also a man in a mask. He altered his identity, discarding the veneer of a statesman for the Maga mask. Both Boelter and Lee profess to be men of faith, draping themselves in the authority of the law as one allegedly committed murder and the other hooted at it. They have both posed as heroic avengers and truth-tellers as they target victims. While speaking of God, the law and a higher calling, they worship at the shrine of Trump. The allegedassassin and the character assassin embody parallel lives that have intersected at the tragedy under the influence of Trump.One grew up in a traditional middle-class family; the other is a privileged son. Each of their fathers were prominent in their communities – one a high school coach, the other solicitor general of the United States. One graduated from St Cloud State University, the other from Brigham Young and its law school. One appeared susceptible to the latest conspiracy theories; the other knows these are lies but amplifies them anyway for personal aggrandizement to win the approval of the mob and its boss. One is a true believer; the other is a cynical opportunist. One is a “loser” in the Trump parlance. The other is a winner in the Trump galaxy. Both put their enemies in their crosshairs. One has been booked for homicide; the other is disgraced as a moral reprobate. One is indicted for his alleged crimes; the other has indicted himself. Both spiraled under Trump and both became lost souls, though Boelter would believe that he was found at last.Vance Luther Boelter grew up in the town of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, one of five siblings, living in a large house, the captain of the high school basketball team, voted “most courteous” and “most friendly”, according to theWashington Post, and his father acclaimed in the Minnesota State High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame. But when he was 17, the mainstream Lutheran young man became a born-again Christian, living in a tent in the local park and shouting sermons to passersby.Ice is cracking down on Trump’s own supporters. Will they change their minds? | Tayo BeroRead moreAfter he received a degree from a state university, he wound up at the Christ for the Nations Institute, a Texas Bible school that emerged in 1970 from a faith healing group founded by Gordon Lindsay. On the lobby wall of the school is a Lindsay saying: “Everyone ought to pray at least one violent prayer each day.”Lindsay was also an organizer for theAnglo-Saxon World Federation, an antisemitic organization in the 1930s and 1940s that spread the doctrine of what was called British Israelism, that Anglo-Saxons, not the Jews, were the chosen people of God. The group distributed Henry Ford’s antisemitic tract, The International Jew: The World’s Foremost Problem, as well as Nazi propaganda, and preached that God would punish Franklin D Roosevelt. Lindsay was a close associate of Gerald Winrod, a pro-Nazi demagogue, who ran a group called Defenders of the Faith and was indicted for seditious conspiracy in 1944. After the war, British Israelism was rebranded as Christian Identity, a theocratic doctrine based in part on racist distinctions between superior and inferior races. Lindsay preached “spiritual war” against the satanic demons of secular culture.Boelter graduated in 1990 from the Christ for the Nations Institute with a degree in practical theology. He wandered as a missionary spreading his gospel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In one sermon, hesaid: “There’s people, especially in America, they don’t know what sex they are. They don’t know their sexual orientation. They’re confused. The enemy has gotten so far into their mind and their soul.”Boelter claimed he was theCEO of the Red Lion security group. He continued his soul-saving. “In the Middle East, I went to the West Bank, the Gaza strip, southern Lebanon, and I would give pamphlets to everybody I could,” he saidin one sermon. He created a website for a religious group hecalled Revoformation. He managed a 7-Eleven store, a gas station, and after taking courses in mortuary science worked transporting bodies to a funeral home. HelistenedtoAlex Jones’s stream of conspiracy-mongering, Infowars.Boelter created a website for a security firm called Praetorian Guard for which his wife was listed as the CEO and he was thehead of security. He bought two cars that he fitted out to look like police cars, stockpiled weapons and uniforms, but had no known business. On 14 June, with his “kill list” in hand, he sent amessageto a longtime friend: “I made some choices, and you guys don’t know anything about this, but I’m going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly …”Boelter’s apparentdisguise as a law enforcement officerwas an expedient that tricked his victims into opening their doors. Pretending to be a police officer, he traduced the law to impose his idea of order.Christ for the Nations Institute issued astatementrenouncing Boelter: “Christ For The Nations does not believe in, defend or support violence against human beings in any form.” It added that the school “continues Gordon Lindsay’s slogan of encouraging our students to incorporate passion in their prayers as they contend for what God has for them and push back against evil spiritual forces in our world”.Mike Lee took the news of the assassinations as thesignal for him to tweet. Lee was born to Mormon royalty in Utah. His father, Rex Lee, was Ronald Reagan’s solicitor general, a principled conservative with an independent streak. He resisted pressure to argue cases on behalf of the administration against separation of church and state that would endorse government-sponsored prayer and religious symbols. He resigned in 1985,stating: “There has been a notion that my job is to press the Administration’s policies at every turn and announce true conservative principles through the pages of my briefs. It is not. I’m the solicitor general, not the pamphleteer general.” Rex Lee became the president of Brigham Young University and dean of its law school, both of which his son attended.Lee was elected to the Senate in great part on the strength of the family name. In 2016, Lee endorsed Ted Cruz for the Republican nomination for president. When Trump wrapped up the nomination, Lee refused to endorse him. “I mean we can get into the fact that he accused my best friend’s father of conspiring to kill JFK,” Leesaid. “We can go through the fact that he has made some statements that some have identified correctly as religiously intolerant.” Lee demanded: “I would like some assurances that he is going to be a vigorous defender of the US constitution. That he is not going to be an autocrat. That he is not going to be an authoritarian.” Lee remained a holdout at the convention until the very end.By 2020, Lee touted Trump as a virtuous figure, comparing him to the self-sacrificing leader in the Book of Mormon. “To my Mormon friends, my Latter-day Saint friends, think of him as Captain Moroni,” a hero in the Book of Mormon, Leetold a rally, with Trump standing beside him. “He seeks not power, but to pull it down. He seeks not the praise of the world or the fake news, but he seeks the wellbeing and the peace of the American people.”After Trump lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden, Lee sent John Eastman, a law professor with a scheme to have the vice-president throw out the votes of the electoral college on January 6, to the Trump White House. While Trump focused on the insurrection, Lee strategized with the chief of staff, Mark Meadows – “trying to figure out a path that I can persuasively defend”,Lee texted Meadows. Lee diligently worked to realize the coup plan using fraudulent electors. “I’ve been calling state legislators for hours today, and am going to spend hours doing the same tomorrow,” Lee wrote Meadows.The anti-Trump camp was in disarray. How has No Kings managed to unite it? | Emma BrockesRead moreThe journalist Tim Alberta, writing inthe Atlantic, described a conversation Lee recounted with one of his staffers about Trump that went far to explain his motive for switching from a critic of Trump’s authoritarianism to a defender. “Donald Trump walks up to the bar,” said the staffer, “and he’s got a beer bottle in his hand, and he breaks the beer bottle in half over the counter and brandishes it.” Lee said he replied: “Immediately, a bunch of people in the room get behind him. Because he’s being assertive. And odds are lower, as they perceive it, that they’ll be hurt if they get behind him.”As Vance Boelter’s life unraveled, perhaps he imagined himself risen into aspirit warrior.Mike Lee knows better. To know better, but not to be better, is his peculiar disgrace. He lacks introspection into the source of his hateful behavior, except to offer the excuse that he won’t “be hurt” by Trump. Not to feel any ordinary emotion for the victims of a terrible and unprovoked crime and instead to engage in taunts betrays his father’s legacy and the shining figure of Captain Moroni, whom Lee has upheld. His fall from grace is one of the incidents that illuminates not only his but also the true character of the Trump era.Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

In a nearly two-hour long interview on Carlson’s own channel and in Cruz’s Washington office, Carlson repeatedly grilled, roasted, and fried the Texas senator, exposing a deepening rift within the Maga movement and showing us the hollowness of our so-called leaders along the way.You don’t have to be a fan of Carlson to enjoy the spectacle of a Republican civil war. Carlson, who once hosted a show on CNN, established his reputation on Fox News and then became “a racist demagogue and promoter of far-right disinformation and dangerous conspiracy theories”, as a 2023 profile in Mother Jonesdescribedhim. While at Fox, he was for a time thehighest ratedpersonality on cable TV and was deeply influential in setting the conservative agenda. On air at Fox – and inthis essayfor Politico – he praised Trump. Off-air, he wastextinghis colleagues a different opinion: “We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights,” Carlson wrote in a text sent on 4 January 2021. “I truly can’t wait,” he wrote, adding: “I hate him passionately.”So there’s something fishy about Carlson. We all know it. Even Fox knew it. He was abruptly fired from the network in 2023 and later launched his own streaming service, the Tucker Carlson Network, in December 2023. His 2024 interview of Vladimir Putin has raised questions about judgment. “I am definitely more sympathetic to Putin than Zelenskyy,” hetoldNewsNation. Questionable, to say the least.Carlson is also a much under-appreciated actor. He will explode in giddy laughter in one second only to turn accusatory the next. He lures you in with a goofy gaze, but he is extremely quick on his feet. He somehow always looks like he just got back from summer vacation. People call him a pundit. I think of him more as a performance artist.While the interview with Cruz illustrates some of Carlson’s abilities, it was also a masterclass in highlighting Cruz’s main talent. Over the years, Cruz has honed the marvelous skill of brilliantly showcasing his own limitations (such as the time Cruzran offto Cancún in the middle of a devastating power outage that occurred during a deep freeze in Texas).The Carlson-Cruz interview centered on a few topics: the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) on American politics, if Aipac should register as a foreign agent (Carlson: Yes. Cruz: No), and who blew up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, among others.The question of the United States going to war with Iran, however, was at the center of theinterview, as it is also at the center of our national politics right now.“How many people live inIran, by the way?” Carlson asks Cruz. “I don’t know the population,” Cruz responds. “You don’t know the population of the country you seek to topple?” Carlson asks, incredulously. Cruz shoots back. “How many people live in Iran?” Carlson quickly responds, “92 million. How could you not know that?” “I don’t sit around memorizing population tables,” Cruz says defensively.“Well, it’s kind of relevant because you’re calling for the overthrow of the government,” Carlson says. “I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran!” “You’re a senator who’s calling for the overthrow of their government. You don’t know anything about the country!” “No. You don’t know anything about the country!”And so it went. The whole fiasco was at times childish, other moments vindictive, but all over simply wonderful, as the Maga world implodes on its own fissures, ignorance, and contradictions.A case in point. Cruz repeatedly lashes out at the Iranian regime for basing its politics on religion, while he wishes to use his own theology to justify his politics. Carlson is having none of it. Itbeganwith Cruz telling Carlson that he was “taught from the bible that those who bless Israel will be blessed, and those who curse Israel will be cursed. And from my perspective, I want to be on the blessing side of things.”“Those who bless the government of Israel?” Carlson asks. Cruz responds that “it doesn’t say the government of Israel. It says the nation of Israel. That’s in the Bible. As a Christian, I believe that.” Carlson presses Cruz. “Where is that?” “I can find it for you. I don’t have the scripture off the tip of my, pull out the phone and use Google.”“It’s in Genesis,” Carlson quickly says. “So you’re quoting a Bible phrase that you don’t have context for and you don’t know where it is, and that’s like your theology? I’m confused.”The Maga movement is doomed to self-destruct at some point, full as it of too many contradictory tendencies. We already saw it crack when Elon and Donald took a relationship pause recently. But there are other fractures. Trump ran on a platform that was supposed to end all wars immediately. That clearly hasn’t happened. In fact, he may soon bring the United States into another endless war in the Middle East.The prospect iswidely disliked, even by his base. Only 19% of those who voted for Trump in 2024think“the US military should get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran”. Maga diehard Marjorie Taylor Greene now calls Fox News “propaganda”,sayingthe American people have been “brainwashed into believing that America has to engage in these foreign wars in order for us to survive, and it’s absolutely not true.” Steve Bannon, a key influence on Trump,toldreporters this week that “We don’t want any more forever wars.” He added: “We can’t do this again. We’ll tear the country apart. We can’t have another Iraq.”For his part, Trump offered his typically bold leadership by tellingreporters“Nobody knows what I’m going to do.” Presumably that nobody also includes him. The White House latersaidthat Trump will “make a decision on whether to attack Iran within two weeks”. Bannon further believes that, if Trump does drag the US into war, most of his base will ultimately follow. The Democratic party, unsurprisingly, can’t decide what it wants, though only10%of those who voted for Harris in 2024 favor going to war.In other words, the US entering Israel’s war with Iran is massively disliked across the political spectrum. But that doesn’t mean it won’t happen. Our fractured and hollow politics may actually enable it. If it happens, the Maga movement may not survive, but do they really have to take the rest of us down with them along the way?Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpIranUS foreign policyTed CruzTucker CarlsonMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Is it best to stay away from next summer’s Trump-Infantino US World Cup? Depending on your politics the answer may be a resoundingnoor a bemused shrug. Some will see pure drive-by entertainment. Why would anyone want to boycott a month-long end-of-days Grand Soccer Parade staged by two of the world’s most cinematic egomaniacs?But it is a question that has been asked, and will be asked a lot more in the next year. Those who intend to travel will need to answer it by action or omission. Would it be better for dissenting media and discomfited football fans to simply no-platform this event?The picture is at least clearer now. After a week of the new steroid-fedClub World Cupwe know what this thing will feel like and who it will benefit. There is no mystery with these events now, no sense of politics lurking coyly out of sight.UnderGianni InfantinoFifa has become a kind of mobile propaganda agency for indulgent regimes, right out in front twirling its pompoms, hitching its leotard, twerking along at the front of the parade like an unholy Uncle Sam.So we had thegrisly sight this week of Donald Trumpnot just borrowing football’s light, but wrestling it on to his lap and ruffling its hair, burbling like a random hot-button word generator about women and trans people, while Juventus players gawped in the background.0:42Trump asks Juventus players during White House visit whether a woman would make their team – videoWe have the spectacle of both club and international football hijacked as a personal vanity platform for Infantino, the dictator’s fluffer, the man who sold the world not once but twice.Infantino’s status as a wildly over-promoted administratorhas always had an operatic quality. But there is something far more sinister in his political over-reach, out there nodding along at the latest Oval Office freak-off, helping to legitimise each divisive statement, each casual erasure of process.Nobody gaveFifaa mandate to behave like this. Its mission is to promote and regulate. And yet here is it acting as a commercial disruptor in its own sport and as a lickspittle to the powerful, disregarding the human rights fluff and political neutrality enshrined in its “statutes”, offering zero transparency or accountability.View image in fullscreenLionel Messi’s fame has added a lustre to the Club World Cup but the tournament is hardly noticeable in the US outside the stadiums.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersTo date Infantino’s only public interface in the US is a “fireside chat”, AKA approved PR interview, at the Dick’s Sporting Goods stage in New York. There he is, up there on the Stage of Dick’s, mouthing platitudes to pre-programmed questions, high on his own power supply, the newly acquired Gianni glow-up eyebrows arched in a patina of inauthenticity. They say celebrity is a mask that eats into the face. Take a look at what football can do to you.And so far this tournament has presented the full grotesquery in store. What is the Club World Cup like on the ground? Pretty much the same as it is on the screen given this event is invisible in physical form beyond the stadiums.The key takeaway is confirmation of the weirdly jackboot, cult-like nature of the Infantino-shaped universe. Even the optics are trying to tell you something, all black holes, hard surfaces, gold, power-flash.Why does Fifa have its own vast lighted branding on the pitch like a global super-corporation or a military dictatorship? What is the Club World Cup logo supposed to represent, with its weird angular lines, the void at its heart? An obscure Stalinist plug socket? Darth Vader’s space fighter? Not to mention the bizarre obsession with that shapeless and indefinable trophy, present on the big screen in every ground in weird scrolling closeup, one minute a Sauron’s eye, the next some kind of finger-snapping torture instrument, with its secret draws full of ectoplasm, a dead crow, the personal effects of Pol Pot.Mainly there is the very openly manipulative nature of the spectacle, football in its final dictator form, with a sense of utter disdain for its captive consumer-subjects. Yes, they will literally put up with anything if we pipe it into their smartphones. So here is beauty, love, colour, connection, the things you’re hard-wired to respond to, cattle-prodded into your nervous system for the benefit of assorted interests. Here is football reimagined as a kind of mass online pornography. Fifa even calls its media website Fifahub.View image in fullscreenWhy does Fifa have its own vast lighted branding on the pitch like a global super-corporation or a military dictatorship?Photograph: Marco Bello/ReutersWith all this in mind some have suggesteda World Cup and US boycottis the correct and logical response, not least in two recent articlespublished in these pages. The organisation Human Rights Watch has carried a warning about the implications of staging the tournament under the Trump regime. Guardian readers and social media voices have asked the same question from all sides of discourse.The hostile versions of this: if you don’t like it then just don’t come, we don’t want you anyway [expletives deleted]. If you were worried about us in Qatar, western imperialist, why are you going to the US? And from the liberal left a concern that to report on sport is also to condone a regime that sends deportation officers to games, imposes travel bans on Fifa members and is edging towards another remote war.And all the while marches football around in a headlock, snapping its underwear elastic, saying thanks, Gianni, for the distracting firework show.This is not a normal situation. So why normalise it? Why give it legitimising light and heat? And yet, one week into the World Cup’s rehearsal dinner, the only logical response is: you just have to go. Not only would a boycott serve no practical purpose; it would be counterproductive, an act of compliance for a regime that will happily operate without an opposing voice on the stage.There are two structural reasons for this. And a third that relates to the United States itself, or at least to the idea of the United States, to its possibilities, which are not defined by Trump, by the latest military action, or by Infantino.Most obviously, if you leave the stage you abandon the argument to the other person. Dissent remains a useful commodity. However pointless, ineffective and landlocked the process of pointing out the flaws and contradictions may have become, it is necessary to keep doing so. Qatar 2022 was a dictator show that simply sailed above the criticisms. But someone, however minor, has to make them, to offer at least some kind of counter-view.No-platforming an autocrat’s show makes no sense on a basic level. These people would prefer you weren’t there in any case. Whereas in reality the people platforming and enabling Trump and Infantino are not journalists trying to give another version of events, but the people who keep voting them into power, friendly dictators, subservient football associations and client media who will be present whatever happens.View image in fullscreenRumours of raids outside the stadiums at the Club World Cup by ICE, the US immigration agency, has added a sinister tone to the tournament.Photograph: Jonathan Alcorn/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockFifa and its Saudi-backed broadcast partner Dazn are glossing up an army of in-house influencers and content-wanglers to generate a wall of approving noise. Is it healthy if these are the only voices at the show? Shouting into a void may have little effect. But you still have to shout.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is why it is coveted, courted and used like a weapon. Last week these pages carnied alogical, entirely legitimate wider view, written by two academics from City University New York, which concluded that a boycott was not just an option but “necessary”.At the same time, the article defined the football World Cup as something that basically has no value, “spectacles of recreation designed to distract people from their day-to-day lives, cultural and political branding opportunities for their hosts. For authoritarians, they have long been used as a tool to distract from or launder stains of human rights violations and corruption.”Which is definitely true. But it also reads like a vision of sport defined by the most joyless version of AI invented. Under this version of events no World Cup or Olympics would have taken place, because they are essentially worthless, home only to malevolent actors, lacking any notion of colour, human spirt, joy, art, beauty or connection.Who knows, maybe this is accurate now. It is undeniably true that the idea of football as a collective people’s game is fairly absurd. Fans of football clubs struggle with this state of cognitive dissonance on a daily basis, the contrast of legacy identity and hard commercial reality. Liverpool are a community club owned by a US hedge fund. Manchester City see themselves as outsiders and underdogs, and are also owned by the Abu Dhabi royal family. Football is the enemy these days.But both sides of this are important, because without that emotional connection, without the act of faith that enables the warm, human part, everything becomes diminished, all our institutions toxic shells. To give up is to abandon sport for ever to the dictators and the sales people, to say, yeah, this just belongs to you now. No-platforming something that still means connection and culture and history. Are we ready for that yet? There will be another version of the present at some point.View image in fullscreenDespite the political issues surrounding the tournament, some of the games in the Club World Cup so far have had good atmospheres.Photograph: Jae C Hong/APThe final point is about the US, a deeply divided and unhappy place right now, and a much-derided host nation, not least by members of its own populace. What has it been like here? The evidence is that an actual World Cup is going to be very hard to negotiate, spread over vast spaces, with baffling travel times, unreliable infrastructure, and a 24-hour attention industry that is already busy gorging on every other spectacle available to the human race.The US has a reputation for peerless razzmatazz around public events. And while this is undeniably true with cultural spectacles it invented – rock’n’roll, presidential races, galactic shopping malls, enormous food, rural tornadoes, its own continental-scale sports – the US’s version of other people’s specialities, from cheese to professional football, can seem a little mannered.But the fact remains the actual games have been quite good. There has been a European-flavoured focus on tickets and empty seats. But 25,000 people on a weekday to watch Chelsea in an ill-defined game is decent evidence of willingness to stage this thing and develop the market.The dismay at 3,500 turning up to Mamelodi Sundowns v Ulsan HD in Orlando overlooks the upside, the fact that 3,500 people actually turned up to Mamelodi Sundowns v Ulsan HD in Orlando. Sundowns get 9,000-odd even at home. How many of their South African fans can afford to travel for this? Fifa, which uses its faux-benevolence cleverly, will point out an African team received $2m (£1.7m) for winning that game. Do we want to develop something or not?A wider point is that football here is a game beloved of immigrant populations. There is a different kind of warmth, often among people without a platform or the means to make it to the matches so far. The waiter who adores Cristiano Ronaldo. The taxi driver who wants to talk for 40 minutes about Chelsea’s wastefulness with academy players. The cop who loves the Colombian national team and is desperate for his son to see them in the flesh.As for the US itself, it still feels like false equivalence to state that this is now an actual dictatorship, a lost land, a place that doesn’t deserve this show because of its flaws and structural violence. This has always been a pretty brutal nation, human life as a constant pressure wave, mainlining heat and light into your veins, but also always taking a bite.The opening week in Miami captured this feeling, football’s most hungrily transactional event staged on a sunken green peninsula, a place where the sea seems to be punching holes in the land, but which is still constantly throbbing with life and warmth and beautiful things.View image in fullscreenEmpty seats at lots of stadiums have become a prominent issue during the Club World Cup.Photograph: Mike Segar/ReutersThere is a nostalgic attachment to the idea of the US for people of a certain age, 20th-century holdovers, brought up on its flaws and imperialism, but also its culture and brilliance. But for the visitor America does seem in a worse state than it did 20 years ago. There is an unhappiness, a more obvious underclass, a sense of neglected parts and surfaces. All the things that were supposed to be good – cars, plenitude, markets, voting, empowerment, civil rights, cultural unity, all the Cokes being good and all the Cokes being the same – seem to have gone bad.But this is also a democracy with an elected leader, albeit one with a lust for executive power and some sinister tendencies. Mainly the US seems to have a massive self-loathing problem. Perhaps you can say it is correct in this, that Trump is enacting actual harms. But Trump is also a symptom of that alienation and perceived decline. He’s an algorithm-driven apparition. Say his name enough times and this cartoon will appear. America remains a great, messy, dangerous, flawed idea of a place. What else is the world currently offering?This is in any case where football will now live for the next year, an unquestioning supplicant in the form of its own autocratic leader. The game is not an indestructible product. It can be stretched thin and ruined by greed, is already at war with itself in many key places. It will at some point be necessary to pay the ferryman, even as the US is packed away a year from now and the sails set at Fifa House for all corners of the globe and then Saudi Arabia. However stormy the prospects, it is not quite the moment to abandon this ship for good.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupFifaDonald TrumpGianni InfantinoFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Stop this madness nowDale VinceThe evidence against the Drax power station is damning, yet the government wants to continue its massive public fundingSat 21 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 21 Jun 2025 06.14 EDTShareHow green is this? We pay billions of pounds to cut downancient forestsin the US and Canada, ship the wood across the Atlantic in diesel tankers, then burn it in a Yorkshire-based power station.Welcome to the scandal of Drax, whereBritain’s biggest pollutergets to play climate hero. The reality is that billions in public subsidies has enabled Drax to generate electricity by burning300m trees. Now the government is trying to force through anextensionthat would grant Drax an estimated£1.8bn in public subsidieson top of the£11bn it has already pocketed, keeping this circus going until at least 2031.This isn’t green energy. The mathematics alone should horrify anyone who cares about value for money or the environment. Burning wood creates18% more CO2 emissions than coal. Even if you replant every tree Drax destroys,it takes up to a centuryfor new growth to reabsorb the carbon released. We’re supposed to reach net zero by 2050, not 2125.Yet through circus-trick accounting, all of Drax’s massive emissions magically disappear from Britain’s climate ledger. They’ve simply been wished away –counted as “zero”, while the company becomes our largest single contributor to climate breakdown.Extraordinarily, this scandal unites opposition across the political spectrum. From the Greens to Reform, from the Morning Star to the Daily Telegraph, there’s rare consensus thatDraxrepresents everything wrong with our approach to climate policy.The Labour-dominated public accounts committeecondemnedDrax as a “white elephant” that’s been allowed to “mark its own homework” while claiming “billions upon billions” in subsidies. A Lords committee agreed, saying parliament needs to see key documentsbefore approving any more funding.I don’t agree with Ed Miliband on everything – we clearly have different views on nuclear power. I respect the energy secretary’s commitment to tackling climate crisis, and it is worth noting that the further subsidies arehalf of what was previously on offerfor Drax. But that’s exactly why continuing to subsidise Drax at all is so disappointing.When Miliband announced his plans to “ramp up”biomass burning back in 2009, he was genuinely trying to find alternatives to fossil fuels. But 16 years on, this policy has gone badly astray. What was meant to be a bridge to renewable energy is actually making emissions worse.If,on Monday, the House of Lords votes to extend this unabated wood burning for another four years, what is to stop these subsidies being extended again and again? And why should the government deal with a firm as untrustworthy as Drax? Perhaps most damning is what Drax refuses to reveal. After the BBC’s devastatingPanorama investigationinto the company’s destruction of Canadian primary forests, Drax asked auditor KPMG to investigate, hoping for a clean bill of health. However, the evidence was so damning that the reports are still beinghidden from the public.If Drax has nothing to hide, why not publish these reports? A former top Treasury official turned whistleblower accused it of deliberatelyconcealing unsustainable practicesto secure subsidies. The case, now settled, raises questions of dishonesty that should disqualify any company from public funding.The extra billions Drax is seeking could help build enough wind and solar capacity to power millions of homes. It could create permanent jobs in genuine renewable industries, not temporary employment destroying irreplaceable ecosystems. Every pound spent subsidising tree burning is a pound not invested in technologies that could actually deliver net zero. While other countries race ahead with wind, solar and battery storage, we’re burning money on the most primitive fuel known to humanity.Calls for Drax to be forced to fully disclose its biomass sourcingRead moreThere’s a huge loophole in the government’s pledge to stop Drax burning trees from primary forest. Their restrictions on Drax only apply to subsidised electricity supplied to the grid. Drax wants to power private data centres but there is no plan that prevents it from destroying ancient forests to power 21st-century AI searches.That means Drax could be cutting down even more primary forests than it does today. MPs have lost trust in the government’s ability to hold Drax to account – the criticism from parliamentary committees has been brutal.The environmental movement didn’t fight to establish renewable energy so politicians could facilitate the burning of ancient forests that took millennia to grow. Real climate action means making hard choices, not hiding behind accounting tricks that make our emissions disappear on paper while making them worse in reality.It is time forLabourMPs to speak up; the fight for net zero is hard enough. More subsidies for Drax’s wood burning in the name of sustainability is just more fuel on that fire.Dale Vince is a green energy industrialist and campaignerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s ironic, then, that the past is precisely where Carpenter’s most outspoken critics could do with looking. It’s clear that the general consensus is lurching grimly to the right when it comes to gender, and a new generation of young, female critics should be wary of falling into step. The debate about how we look at women, and what they want, risks limply missing the point.In the past few weeks, Sydney Sweeney has been chastised forselling sexy soap, and Addison Rae scolded for dancing in her underwear on stage. It’s odd that the backlash has been so immense, given the celebration of Halina Reijn’s Babygirl film just a few months ago. The SheEO Nicole Kidman slurping milk out of a saucer? Hot. Sweeney’s dirty bathwater? Degrading and vapid. Seemingly, Kidman’s age made the former radically feminist, and by extension, permissible in the eyes of the kink police.It is relevant that these debates now take place on online platforms. At their best, these spaces could provide a rare forum for popular culture to be taken seriously. From uses of the “sexy virgin” trope to golden-age glam fantasies of whiteness, to the transformative influence of a queer audience, there are so many interesting things to say about women such as Carpenter, Sweeney and Rae, and how we are encouraged to read them. Instead, the conversation is dictated by sexist algorithms, financially rewarding those with the most extreme views. Liberation no longer brings clicks, and so to open TikTok is to fall headfirst into a sea of diatribes so puritanical they’d bring a tear to Oliver Cromwell’s eye.View image in fullscreenAddison Rae performs live in New York on 5 June.Photograph: Daniel Zuchnik/Getty Images for SpotifyNone of this is to say that to criticise the pop girlies is blasphemy, but vitriolic chastisement is no substitute for meaningful critique. One TikTok user, priding herself on inspiring tellings of “Herstory”, asserts: “Sabrina knows nothing … [she is] a disgrace to every woman that has ever lived.” Oddly, accounts like this have a fetishistic preference for girlbosses centuries dead, happy to build a brand around celebrating “first” women (authors, chemists, queens, you name it), while throwing abuse at those making headlines today. If only, the inference usually seems to be, young women such as Carpenter could be as good at feminism as Jane Austen or Anne Boleyn.In fact, the real lessons are to be learned from histories a little more recent. These critiques seem largely ignorant of the “sex wars” of the 1970s, which saw militant feminists such as Andrea Dworkin argue that whatever the context, pornographic imagery was hateful, exploitative and male. Against her were sex-positive feminists such as Angela Carter, attempting to think generously and with complexity about desire and domination in women’s lives. If anyone could be bothered to dig it out, Carter’s 1978 book The Sadeian Woman might turn the argument about Carpenter on its head. There, she historicises the “good bad girl”, “blonde, buxom” with a “childlike charm”, suggesting the impossibility of writing about power and sex without writing about capitalism too. For Carter, pornographic imagery, playing on domination and subordination, wasn’t to be straightforwardly judged or disregarded, but might instead be seen as “a critique of current relations”.View image in fullscreenThe cover of Carpenter’s new album, Man’s Best Friend.Photograph: Island RecordsFor all that the sex wars were aggressively fought, they were also full of rich argument, breadth and a long-lost awareness of economic forces. One thing Dworkin did get right was pornography’s grim realities when constrained to a ruthless commercial sphere. When it comes to the multibillion-pound porn industry and the world of pop, those with the real power, much like the anonymous, suited man on the cover of Carpenter’s album, rarely appear in frame.It’s ironic, then, that in January, no less than the record producer Pete Waterman singled out Carpenter as a small blond symbol of sexism. She was, he claimed, setting women’s rights back years, adding: “If you’re asking to be respected, don’t come on in a G-string.” I’m not sure Carpenter needs to beg for respect from those cooped up in the retirement home for pop producers presumably still profiting from Kylie’s hotpants, but those comments serve to remind us that little has changed when it comes to raking in the cash. That latter-day Pete Watermans are still those benefiting, in this case from charged debates about violence against women, is what socialist-feminists would have been pointing out decades ago, and precisely what we should be talking about today.If images of sexual subordination make some feminists uncomfortable, we should talk about that too. Instead, we’re reverting to ironically paternalistic tellings off. Of course, it should come as little surprise to find the parameters of feminine sexuality being policed under the patronising pretence of concern for women’s safety. It’s precisely this logic that has been weaponised against transgender women for years. The result? A feminism that packs women into smaller and smaller boxes with every convenient transgression that comes along.We might ask questions about the unhappy marriage of capitalism and kink, but suggesting that women who want to experiment consensually with images of domination should in some way take the blame for male violence is dangerous, distracting and ignorant of history. Decades of work (against, for instance, the so-called “rough sex defence”) have been spent protecting women’s right to express themselves sexually without fear of harm – it isn’t “choice feminism” to try to hold that ground.“I can’t escape your history,” sings Carpenter on a 2022 track. If only those attacking her felt the same way about the feminism they invoke, they might see what’s really going on here. It’s not so much a return to sexy pop that is restricting women as the censorious criticisms that pop’s profit-driven branding seems perfectly calculated to provoke.Jennifer Jasmine White is a writer and academicExplore more on these topicsFeminismOpinionSabrina CarpenterWomenMusic industryPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

Even from their bomb shelters, most Israelis support his warAluf BennWithin Israel, Iran is seen as the ultimate threat. The prime minister knows this is his chance to rewrite his bloodied legacySat 21 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTShare“It’s 1938 and Iran is Germany … The Jewish people will not allow a second Holocaust.” Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, recited slogans like theseincessantly for decades, urging action against the gravest threat to the Jewish state – a nuclear-armed Iran. He conveyed the message to successive US presidents. He presented abomb cartoon at the UN. At countless Holocaust memorial events he described Iran’s nuclear ambitions as the present-day “final solution”.Netanyahu talked and talked about the pressing Iranian threat, but his listeners were not convinced. They dismissed him as an alarmist whose deadlineIrancrossed year after year without deploying a nuclear weapon (it still hasn’t). Netanyahu’s critics at home taunted him as a chicken who would never dare to attack Iran’s nuclear installations – unlike his more decisive predecessors, who had ordered the bombing of nuclear reactors in Iraq and Syria.Everything changed on Friday 13 June.At 3am local time, Israelis were woken by an urgent alert from the Home Front Command, ordering us to stay near our safe rooms or bomb shelters. Shortly after, an official announcement told us that Israel hadattacked Iran’s nuclear plantsand air defences, and assassinated its top military brass and nuclear scientists. When the night came, a barrage of Iranian missiles hit Tel Aviv and its outskirts. The exchanges of bombs, drones and missiles have continued ever since, causing more than260 civilian deathsin Iran and 24 in Israel, and inflicting considerable damage.To Netanyahu and his followers, 13 June is the big vindication. An opportunity to rewrite his legacy, which has beenmarred by his failure to prevent the disaster of 7 October 2023, when Hamas attackedIsrael, killing about 1,200 and kidnapping 250 hostages to Gaza, and igniting a devastating war that is still going on. The prime minister ignored warnings of imminent war while pushing autocracy, then blamed the security services, spreading excuses and conspiracy theories only his diehard supporters believed.The ensuing Gaza war did little to boost Netanyahu’s leadership credentials. Even after Israel had killed more than55,000 Palestiniansit failed to achieve the “ultimate victory” pledged by the prime minister. Hamas, however decimated, is still in charge, and 53 Israeli hostages – 20 of them believed to be alive – are still in captivity. To many around the world, Netanyahu’s name is synonymous with mass murder. Even in Israel, anti-war sentiment began to rise after he broke a fragile ceasefire on 18 March.Attacking Iran, however, is far more consensual in Israel. A poll by the Israel Democracy Institute released on Thursday showed 82% of Jewish respondents – including 57% who consider themselves leftwing –support the decisionto attack Iran. Among Arab respondents, 11% support and 65% oppose striking Iran.To Israelis, Iran is the ultimate, scariest enemy. Since the revolution in 1979, it has been preaching the destruction of the “Zionist regime”. Over the years it built and armed a “ring of fire” around Israel, led by the Lebanese Hezbollah and its arsenal of rockets and missiles. In recent years, Iran and its allies contemplated a plan to destroy Israel through a combination of cross-border invasion and pinpoint missile attacks. But on 7 October Hamas acted alone, enabling Israel to regroup and hit its enemies one by one.Last autumn, the “ring of fire” collapsed. Israel defeated Hezbollah andkilled its leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, took out Iran’s key air defences, and watched the Syrian Assad regime, Iran’s oldest regional ally, collapse overnight. Tehran’s skies were now open to Israeli bombers, just like Gaza’s, and rising voices called on Netanyahu to fulfil his lifelong mission and attack Iran – including the former prime minister Naftali Bennett, his apparent rival in the next election.Military opportunity notwithstanding, the turning point in Israel’s war planning was Donald Trump’s second coming to the White House. Netanyahu believed he could extract an unprecedented green light to hit the uranium-enrichment and missile plants in Iran. Israel’s military top brass was reluctant to act without the US consent that had never arrived. With Trump back in office, Netanyahu overcame his doubts. The Americans were aware of the war preparations in Israel. But Trump had bad news for Netanyahu. He opted for negotiating a new nuclear deal with Iran, seven years afterhe had ditchedBarack Obama’s agreement under Netanyahu’s prodding. The Israeli leader postponed the operation, only to launch it when Trump’s 60-day deadline to Tehran expired. From Netanyahu’s perspective, Trump’s support for the attack – howeverlukewarm at first– has been the peak diplomatic achievement of his career.To many Israelis, the successful first strike echoed Israel’s greatest military victory, the six-day war of 1967. American analysts were quick to declare Israel the new regional hegemon. Even as millions of Israelis were running to their shelters several times a day, Netanyahu and the IDF leadership exuded euphoria, all but eager to erase their 7 October disaster and the Gaza quicksand. They raised high expectations for direct US intervention – needed to destroy Iran’sunderground nuclear plant– and for regime change in Tehran, threatening the assassination of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.We’re on the brink of a disastrous, illegal conflagration in the Middle East. Trump must be stopped | Fawaz GergesRead moreBut Netanyahu, who was drafted to IDF special forces shortly after the six-day war, should have known the dire lessons of 1967: bragging leads to complacency, which leads to disaster – as happened in 1973, when Egypt and Syria fought back. Brilliant tactical moves are no guarantee for victory, as they morph into mission creep and indecisive attrition. Israel’s success in rolling back Iran’s nuclear programme is still unclear, but conducting a “war of cities” between Tehran and Tel Aviv will be clearly devastating.The first days of his Iranian campaign brought Netanyahu a moment of relief from his political troubles. His corruption trial, where he is facing cross-examination, is postponed. Opposition leaders applauded his decision to attack Iran. And the 7 October reruns and stories about the hostages, constant reminders of Netanyahu’s failure, are off primetime television.Yet true to form, Netanyahu is showing no interest in reconciliation with his real or imaginary rivals. On the contrary, he appears to view his new heroic credentials as a means to double down on his race to turn Israel into a theocratic autocracy, a Hebrew-speaking version of Iran. His critics were hardly surprised when, visiting a bombed hospital in Beersheba, he spoke of his familypaying the “cost” of war, having had to postpone his younger son’s wedding. To them it was another example of his condescending detachment from the plight of ordinary Israelis. His critics dismiss the decision to attack Iran as politically motivated and careless. They are a minority, according to a Channel 13 poll released on Wednesday, in which 64% of respondentsbelieved that Netanyahutruly wants to rid Israel of Iran’s nukes and missiles, and only 28% attributed political motives to his war decision. But their support for the destruction ofNatanz and Fordow, and even of getting rid of Iran’s rulers, was not translated to an intention to vote for the current coalition, which remains unpopular.Netanyahu’s vindication, apparently, would take much more than bombing sorties over Iran.Aluf Benn is the editor-in-chief of HaaretzExplore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuOpinionIsraelIranMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Growing your own food has environmental benefits too, especially if you use acompost heap, worm farm or bokashi binto divert kitchen scraps from landfill.But can you garden without a back yard? To meet Australia’s housing challenge, more city dwellers will live in apartments and townhouses, and gardening in small spaces like balconies and courtyards can be challenging.I found this out last summer when I planted tomatoes in pots on our west-facing balcony. By Christmas, the plants were vigorous and tall, providing a calming wall of green outside my 20th-floor window. But sweltering January days put paid to my hopes of a bountiful crop. Despite plenty of water, the plants couldn’t cope with drying winds and the belting afternoon sun, its rays magnified through glass balustrades.What to consider when gardening at heightHorticulturist Charlotte Harrison fromSustainable Gardening Australiathinks I might have had better luck if I’d planted tomatoes later in the season.“Gardening at height is more extreme than gardening at ground level,” she says. “There’s heaps of extra heat radiating from the concrete of the building plus extra light reflected from glass.”Downsizing the Australian dream: why families are trading houses with back yards for apartmentsRead moreAs a rule of thumb, Harrison reckons high-rise balconies can be one climate zone warmer than is normal for the local area. On our Melbourne balcony, she says, I’d do better to consult a Sydney planting chart when deciding what to grow and when.“Think about the microclimate of the space you’re gardening in,” advises Harrison. “Consider how these conditions might be replicated in nature and what might grow there naturally.”An east-facing space is generally more conducive to growing vegetables in summer than a west-facing one. Plants enjoy early light, when the sun is gentler, and shade in the afternoon as the temperature rises.Winds are stronger higher up a building, so our balcony could be compared to a seaside cliff in the Mediterranean, better suited to hardy plants like olives and rosemary than to tomatoes. If conditions are too harsh for fruit or vegetables, then succulents and other desert plants can help to green a space instead.No shade? Solutions for following (or avoiding) the sunCreating shade on a balcony can be tricky. Body corporate rules may restrict what can be fixed to the building, but anything not securely anchored could blow away and injure someone below. One option is planter boxes with attached shade hoods. Harrison recommends choosing one that is light in colour to reflect heat and that has awicking bedso plants can draw on a reservoir of water. Make sure you’re not overloading your balcony or deck – a planter box full of soil can double in weight when watered.Is my rented garden an act of resistance to the precarity of my living situation? Possibly | Jaimee Frances EdwardsRead moreWhen growing in pots, bigger is generally better, says Harrison, because soil in small pots dries out quickly, even when well mulched. Most plants need as much space for roots below as their branches and leaves take up above, so it’s better to grow four plants together in one large pot to share soil and resources than separately in four little ones. Before planting, put large pots on low stands with heavy duty castors so they can be easily moved to follow (or avoid) the sun as it shifts with the seasons. And don’t forget drip trays to conserve water and avoid annoying downstairs neighbours.Selecting the right plants: try trellises and compact varietiesThink carefully about plant selection based on your conditions. Compact varieties of tomatoes, chillies or lemons will be less prone to wind and sun damage than taller traditional varieties. Root vegetables are good for windy settings because soil protects them from the elements.Too much sun is one challenge for gardening in small spaces, too little is another. There’s no point in trying flowering vegetables in spots lacking direct sunlight. For a shady position, leafy greens are a better option, or perhaps you can grow upwards to reach the light. A zucchini plant, for example, is a vine and can be trained to grow up a trellis or a stake.“Growing vertically can really increase growing space,” says Harrison. But the horticulturist is wary of vertical gardens. They look good, but often need dedicated watering systems and involve plants in small pots that need constant replacement. “For most home gardeners, having a trellis makes far more sense,” she says.Gardening is a source of great pleasure and makes the concrete jungle a bit greener. Acommunity gardencan be a great way to get your fingers in the dirt and meet your neighbours. But don’t let limited space deter you from gardening at home too. Harrison’s advice: “Dream big, but start small.”Explore more on these topicsGardensChange by degreesEthical and green livingGardening adviceAustralian lifestyleVegetablesFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, with a highly anticipated Glastonbury slot, the California-dwelling earth mother is ready to let rip again …Sat 21 Jun 2025 06.45 EDTShareAlanis Morissette asks which version of herI wish to hear from: “The hormonal bitch who has a lot to say? The people-pleasing, kind, amenable part? They’re all here.” It’s 9am in sunny Los Angeles and the ­Canadian-born singer-songwriter is ­wearing a slouchy top, her wavy hair loose. She’s long been aware of these different“parts”, that her life is full of contradiction. “I have 14 different opinions about one thing.” It’s why, aged 19, she wrote Hand In My Pocket (lyrics include:I’m high, but I’m grounded/ I’m sane, but I’m ­overwhelmed), one of several anthems on Jagged ­Little Pill, the album released 30 years ago this month. Back then, in the unenlightened 90s, people found this sort of talk unnerving. “They were like, ‘Whoa, that’s scary. What are you talking about?’”“They called it my ‘psychobabble’. I’m like, ‘I’m going to stay the course with my psychobabble.’” It’s what she sees as her “karmic assignment” and feels not a little vindicated now that these ideas are welcomed by the mainstream. There’s a whole seam of psychotherapy that views the mind as composed of distinct “parts”, called Internal Family Systems. Morissette speaks at the symposiums, as well as summits on trauma, or wholeness verses wellness, career, art and feminism. She hosted a podcast devoted to this stuff. “The healing arts,” she says, adding drily: “I am from California, never forget that. California, because if I were in any other state my head might explode.”Morissette hair-whipped into our consciousness, a waif with a wide smile belting raw honesty in an outsized mezzo-soprano, with You Oughta Know. It wasn’t just the “psychobabble” that caused consternation. It was the unsettling range of female emotion, the androgyny, the ‘monstrous feminine’. “I used to say, ‘I’m on the frontlines, I get my head chopped off.’” Jimmy Fallon compared her to a troll doll. Rolling Stone called her “rage-filled”, put her on theNovember 1995 coverwith the headline Angry White Female. Purists cleared their throats over the use of “ironic” in her track of that title. The New York Times declared the things she described – “a black fly in your chardonnay”, “rain on your wedding day” – “distinctlyunironic”. Morissette said yes, she was sometimes “the malapropism queen”. But her fans understood. And 33m of them bought Jagged Little Pill, so.Since then, she’s sold 75m records, released 10 albums, most recently The Storm Before the Calm, featuring 11 guided meditations. She’s acted in films, led healingworkshops, raised awareness on issues such as sex abuse, postpartum depression, disordered eating, addiction. We’ve met because this Friday evening she will step on to Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage. She’s never been to Glastonbury – which seems incredible; in so many ways she might have been hatched in a tent in the Healing Field – but as an artist, she says, “It was bucket-listy.”View image in fullscreenMorissette at John Anson Ford theater in Hollywood, California, in 1995.Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic, IncShe’s grateful to still be able to perform work from her 30-year oeuvre without compromising herself. It’s because she still believes every lyric, she says, “value systems-wise and in terms of passions”. There’s only one she’s iffy about. It’s a song about partnerships called Not the Doctor, which says, essentially, “I don’t want to worry about your stuff. Your stuff is your stuff. My stuff’s my stuff. Never the twain shall meet.” She pulls a face. “Now I’ve been married 15 years, I’m like, Oh, the twain shall meet. The twain are very much meeting every day.”This morning she’s at her desk in the home she shares with the rapper Souleye (whom she met at a meditation retreat in 2009) and their three children, sons Ever, 14, and Winter, five, and daughter Onyx, nine. Also in the house, “so many dogs and animals, holy fuck”. The camera her end tips up from time to time creating a sensation for me of being capsized.Ifirst met Morissette five years ago when she was in London for the launch of her album Such Pretty Forks in The Road. She was breastfeeding her youngest, then a few months old, and grappling with “lacto-menopause” (What’s that? “It’s a fucking shitshow”). My takeaway then: Morissette doesn’t do half measures, but she does do gallows humour. She had been living in Berkeley, California, enjoying the community spirit, people dropping round with smoothies and hot soup. She found the microclimate calming on her nervous system when the energy in LA got too much. “There’s a lot of unfinished trauma in LA,” she told me then.Before moving to Berkeley, she’d been in the western suburbs of LA for 24 years. They then lived in Malibu, but were driven out by fires in 2019. She has occasionally tried to live outside the state, “briefly” on Bowen Island, Vancouver. And she tried New York for a year. “But that Pacific Ocean, it keeps pulling me back,” she says. Yup, she’s “a Californian girl through and through”.By January this year, they had been living in Pacific Palisades in LA for just a few months when thewildfirestore through their neighbourhood, writing off their house and 85% of their belongings. More than 200,000 people were displaced. Many of her friends fled to New York, whole communities upped sticks.It was the ocean, the communal living vibe, the generalfeeling the feelsthat made her want to stay in California. The family initially found a temporary solution, living “communally” with four friends between January and May. About a month ago, Morissette worked “feverishly” to find the house she’s in now, a block from where she used to live, surrounded by hills, “room-mating indefinitely” with a friend who lost his home in Altadena, north LA.She says a heaviness persists in the city, “a grief”. She avoids the devastated areas, even if it means taking long detours, “because when you drive through Sunset all the way down, it’s still surreality”. She says her mind can’t compute what her eyes are seeing. And the beach is out, because any time she contemplates going in the water she remembers, “it’s likely filled with toxins” from the ash. “It’s a different city now, but it’s always a cool city. I’m pretty in love with Los Angeles.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Shelby DuncanA few days after we speak, the city lit up again, this time with protests against Donald Trump’s immigration raids, whichspread across the countryafter the US president’s deployment of the national guard. The night before Morissette and her family left for Norway for the first date of her summer tour, a curfew was imposed by the LA mayor.I ask about living in Trump’s America, and she says (with a touch of sarcasm) that she was looking forward to this part of the conversation. “The gift of travelling the planet is I get glimpses of how the international community perceive America,” she says. She has a way of summing up how Canadians respond to rudeness. They are, “Nice, nice, nice. Then piss us off on the wrong day and we explode.” Is this prime minister Mark Carney’s way of doing business with Trump? She laughs. “It becomes a hard no. We try to be amenable, but then it’s a very hard no. Unequivocal. So that’s kind of our thing, culturally. We came by it honestly.”Morissette’s tour will take in cities all over Europe including London, Dublin, Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow. She says when she’s touring, she’s pretty nocturnal, going to bed as late as 4am. Mornings are sharpened with a bulletproof coffee and she practises “intuitive” intermittent fasting. When she’s at home, she “putters – you know, organising and cleaning with no agenda. I’ll get back to you on what that means neurobiologically.” She says her awareness is “diffuse” while she does this, which is “instantly feminine”.“You can be aware that your child just stubbed his toe, the dog needs his food, the husband needs a snug. That’s the divine feminine capacity.” Her mentor, the late author and addiction specialist Pia Mellody, once said vacuuming was her spiritual practice. “I was like, ‘That’s mine, too!’ So, if you see a clean environment, it means I was meditating.”While we talk, her husband, whose real name is Mario Treadway, is padding about somewhere in the house. He’s released nine albums, and there’s some thematic crossover with his wife in terms of an interest in spirituality, “inner child work” and mental health (he lost an older brother to suicide). Certainly, from the outside – see Instagram – their home is a sweet, functioning environment. He’s the kind of husband who wears a Patriarchy Hurts Us All T-shirt and makes juices (spinach, celery and lemon) for breakfast before shouldering his share of the children’s home schooling. As musicians, they “make sense to each other”, Morissette says. “I’m not strange to him. I’m not weird or freakish.”But they put the work in. She can’t imagine how relationships manage without couples counselling. “I’m a huge couples therapist person. I have been for ever.” Her non-negotiable is that the therapist be “trauma-informed” and “addiction-informed”. “I can’t be supported by someone who doesn’t look through those lenses.”Any addiction, if we keep going with it, we’re dead. It is great for 20 minutes, then you’re deadShe’s long been frank about addiction, deliberately so. “I call addiction ‘relief-seeking measures that kill you eventually’.” Work, love, sex and shopping, “those are the chestnuts” for her. They are “Whac-a-Mole”, in that as soon as she’s bashed one, another pops up. Being a workaholic is “especially” hard. “Because the number one priority is being clicked into some seed of productivity. There’s no worth in justbeing. And it’s a higher power thing, so work addiction is also called the praise addiction.”For instance: “If I said, ‘Oh, I did heroin till four in the morning and totally blacked out,’ people would be like, ‘Oh shit. Bitch needs some help.’But if I said, ‘I’ve been working my fucking ass off for this deadline and I finished at 4.15am,’ people would be patting my back and be, like, ‘Good work, girl.’ It’s equally corrosive. Because any addiction, if we keep going with it, we’re dead. It is great for 20 minutes, then you’re dead.”She’s joking about the “20 minutes” and at the same time very much not joking about the “dead”. She describes herself as part of the 20% of the population who are “highly sensitive” as well as part of the 4% who are “empaths” – meaning she’ll walk into a room porous to everyone else’s issues, pain and general unresolved junk. It’s a cursed trait, she says. Society loves the “yield” of the sensitive person: “They love the songs, the photos, the art. But they don’t love the human.” Without therapy, she “would not be alive”.She was suicidal? “All the time. I still struggle with it. I have an anxious, depressive tendency. Those who are sensitive are much more susceptible to their environmental information. If you put a highly sensitive person in an environment where they’re brow-beaten or reduced, they’ll basically want to kill themselves. It’s the worst. If you put a highly sensitive person in an environment where they’re supported, championed and listened to, they thrive.”For her own children, Morissette has tried to create an environment where their “multiple intelligences” are nurtured. A word about “multiple intelligences” for the uninitiated. It’s a theory developed by the US psychologist Howard Gardner, who identified eight different types of intelligences alongside the old “academic, sit in your chair and get good grades in a test” type. Morissette is a fierce advocate of the intelligences. I’ll let her take it from here: “My job has always been to understand an entire model through clinical training and otherwise, and then update it. Expand it. So when I interviewed Gardner on the podcast, I said, ‘Can I update the multiple intelligences?’ And he said, ‘You can do whatever you want, Alanis.’”“So now I have 16 intelligences. Not only do I use that as a template when I’m home schooling, but I also use it as a template if friends come to me worried about their kids. Or if we’re talking about the conventional curriculum in public schools, or what the government’s up to with education. I constantly reference multiple intelligences, because so many kids say, ‘I’m really dumb.’ And it kills me. I’m just like, ‘What do you mean? Where are your intelligences? Where do you spark up? Where do you jump out of bed in the morning?’ And it might be physical intelligence. It might be that you’re meant to do backflips in a way that I’ll never do. I’ll need a stunt double for that. So I go through it with anybody who’s across from me and seeking support.”She calls home school “unschool”, and the kids are allowed to opt into the mainstream the moment they choose. Ever, for instance, chose to go at seventh grade. I ask her to give me a flavour. “Like, Winter will be singing to us his whole day, channelling his stream of consciousness. And then Onyx is twirling around the room. Artistry as a way of life is so normalised in our family. It’s not like if one person’s loving their academic moment, that isn’t recognised. If someone’s loving the backflip they just mastered, we’re like, ‘Awesome!’ So there is a celebration of process here. Destination is fun, butprocessis everything. We value that here.”View image in fullscreenOn stage in Paris with her husband Souleye, 2012.Photograph: David Wolff/Patrick/Redferns/Getty ImagesMorissette calls the people who help the family the “caregiving gang”, certainly a nicer way of putting it than “nannies and tutors”. Everybody in that gang knows about the multiple intelligence system. “What I’ve done is laminated maps and posters to indicate what each might look like. For example, musical intelligence might look like Souleye in the studio writing a song. He’ll bring Onyx in, and she’ll write a song, and he’ll record it.”Naturalist intelligence is another. The family have a farm in northern California where they keep cows, turkeys, ducks, snakes “and tons of chickens. Onyx is super knowledgable, to the point where, when I don’t know a thing about an animal, I just turn to her. So we’ve got our naturalist intelligence there, our animal empath. I can’t even keep a plant alive.”She loves the tranquillity of the farm, the peaceful escape. “I love anywhere where there’s a vortex,” she says. For a second, I think:vortex?The internet informs me that there’s an alternative definition. A vortex in this context is “a state of alignment with one’s desires and source energy”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s a linguistic issue.” She loves words, loves using them, “but sometimes I play with them a little much”. She’ll create words – tangentalise, decohesify – that intuitively seem to fit.How does she talk to her kids about the postpartum depression she experienced after all three were born? “I apologise all the time. They’ll say, ‘I remember that whole era,’ and I’ll say, ‘Well, I wasn’t exactly available to show up for you in the full way that I wanted to.’ I am pretty transparent about how I failed them. And my running joke, which is not a joke, is that I have accounts set up for their potential college fees, if that’s the route they take, but I also have whole accounts set up for their therapy, because they’re going to need it.”View image in fullscreenPlaying in Budapest, 2008.Photograph: Karoly Arvai/ReutersMy hair is a band mate. It’s a way of expressing and flailing and raging. It’s a friend who protects me when I’m feeling vulnerable on stageShe says interest in postpartum depression is better than it was, say, 30 years ago. “But ‘interest’ isn’t salve. Being interested in someone’s suffering isn’t the same as showing up for it. There’s not a lot of education around anything feminine, but this one especially. So, it’s rugged. But I really consider myself a sort of existential cockroach. There’s a tenacity – I don’t know where it comes from, probably my parents – to keep going.” She puts on a voice here of someone asking a question after the birth of Winter, when she was 45: “‘Why would you get pregnant again if you’ve already been through it twice and it gets progressively worse?’ I’m like, ‘Well, look at my children. I’ll do anything for these kids. To meet them, even, I’ll suffer anything.’” She pauses then adds: “It’s also a generation X thing. We’re known for our white-knuckle approach to fricking everything.”She’s tugging the ends of her hair. I should say something about her hair. It’s still long, brown, middle-parted and what the kids would call iconic in the way Janis Joplin’s was, too. Morissette helicoptered it on stage, semi-dreaded it in You Learn, wore it as her only clothes in her video for Thank U. “I mean, my hair is a band mate,” she says. “It’s a way of expressing and flailing and raging. It’s like a typewriter, it speaks on my behalf. Without me, even. It’s a friend who protects me when I’m feeling vulnerable on stage. If you have 80,000 or 200,000 people looking, a well-placed moment of deep” – she mimes retreating behind her hair – “and then I’m back” – she mimes re-emerging – “It’s a pretty way of hiding. The perfect tool for an introvert. And I’ve always felt androgynous, so in some ways my earrings or my hair length can remind someone that it’s a female body.”She doesn’t mind when it’s long and greasy, she likes the “aesthetic of dirty chic” (I fear Glastonbury may test even the steeliest Californian). Plus, her hair supplied a fierce and tangible shift from the way she’d been moulded as a child star back home in Canada.Born in Ottawa, Alanis Morissette was one of three children of teachers Alan Morissette and Georgia Feuerstein; her mother’s family escaped the Hungarian revolution when she was 10. “Basically, they were on a train, someone leaned over and said, ‘Hey, we just want to let you know that every family getting off at the next stop is being taken away to be killed. Your family might want to jump off.’ They did, looked back from the field, and saw everyone being executed.”Morissette has an older brother Chad, and a twin, Wade. By all accounts she was a child in constant motion, always spinning, singing. “My twin brother used to joke he would be playing soccer while I was writing songs about fate,” she has said. She tells me two clear things about her early life. One that she had a “prophetic” vision of herself travelling the planet and singing. “That’s what I saw as a very young person.” The second is that her “psychological leanings” were always there. “We all have our funny roles in our family, and my role was the ‘psyche understander’ and the conflict resolver. Some might think that made me the peacemaker, but really, I was just the family therapist. Which is exciting, but also horrifying.” (Does she still have that role? She laughs. “I quit.” She mimes handing out other therapists’ numbers, “Here’s a couple of business cards.”)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Shelby DuncanAt the age of 10, Morissette – Lady Di hairdo and roll-up jeans – appeared in five episodes of the Nickelodeon kids’ series You Can’t Do That on Television. She used the money she earned to make her first album. At the same time, she was a competitive swimmer with a punishing training schedule. Not long after, she was signed by MCA, who turned her into a cringy pop princess bopping with Paula Abdul-style dance moves in a crucifix and bra top. She even opened for rapper Vanilla Ice. She was cutting records in studios until 3am and still attending school – even if the classroom desk was just a chance to catch up on sleep.Behind the teen gloss, of course, were the predatory men, the exploitative financial deals, the criticisms about her looks and weight. All this, in an era that celebrated size zero, cemented a severe eating disorder.After high school, she learned to play guitar and started writing songs. Aged 19, she moved to LA and spent her days trying to navigate a culture where no one asked her a question and just writing, writing, writing on the beach. Music was suddenly an outlet. Her lyrics were, “psychologically, spiritually, emotionally informed”. She was signed by Madonna’s label Maverick and Jagged Little Pill was released when she was 21, selling half a million copies in one week. Nonetheless, it was a “rough time” to be a solo artist. “There was no one to hide behind. What I found in terms of the lovely patriarchy, was that at that time if men couldn’t fuck me, they didn’t know what to do with me.”When she looked around her in the musical landscape, the people who seemed successful were “secure in their loudness, à la Courtney Love. That seemed to be valued. I was like, ‘OK, I’m going to pretend to be an extrovert for the next 25 years.’ So, tequila – anything that allowed me to be the life of the party – or if I was doing a talk, Xanax. Anything that would help me pretend I’m not me.”I’m working micro-feminisms into every board meetingShe takes a deep breath and says as if speedily wrapping up, “And that’s why perimenopause is so great, because now there’s zero desire to present as something that I’m not. I spent 25 years trying to be someone who didn’t have this temperament. At 51, I feel this is just what it is like.”She says that menopause is “rough and amazing, both”. She interrupts herself to ask if I know about the micro-feminism trend, “where you just impose the feminine on everything. It’s anything’s like, ‘Oh, I need to talk to a doctor, becauseshe’lltell me … ’ I do it all the time. If someone sees a bug, ‘Oh my gosh,she’sgorgeous.’ Because, obviously, patriarchy would have it be such that every fucking thing is male, including the creatures. I’m working those micro-feminisms into every board meeting.”She hates that the hyper-sexuality of the 90s and 00s is back. That “size zero” is back. “We thought that whole era was done, right? We sorted this out! Didn’t we? Oh, we didn’t. We dropped the ball. The collarbone thing came back in … and the hyper-sexualization thing is so boring.” She laughs: “Of course, a perimenopausal woman’s going to say that, right? My procreative imperative is, thank fucking God, chilling out. There are gorgeous things that come along with that – less people-pleasing, more directness. But I’m still in the middle of it. And that can be disconcerting. Most of my friends are in the middle of it, too, so we cut each other a lot of slack. My menopausal women friends are like, ‘Honey, it gets fucking great.’ It’s the best news.”Morissette believes medicine should embrace all the woo-woo, including psilocybin (the hallucinogenic compound found in some mushrooms) or MDMA treatments for PTSD. “I think it’s all fantastic. The future in medicine – pharma is not maybe going to be so happy hearing this – is prevention, heading things off at the pass; understanding things hormonally, emotionally, circumstantially, relationally to past traumas. So that includes microdosing, ketamine, or whatever you need to do. We’ve come a long way; people know how to do this now, so I’m excited.”Does this mean her view of sobriety is nuanced? “There are some people who would get very mad at me for implying at all that it’s nuanced. Because for those of us who were drinking at seven in the morning, well there’s nothing nuanced about that. So, I guess it depends. For me, it’s whichever addiction is bringing you to death very fast. Which one is it? Which one’s ruining your relationships? And then there’s the Whac-a-Mole approach, which is, ‘OK, I’ve stopped not eating. And now I’m working my ass off. Oh, yeah, and I took a few too many pills.’ The Whac-a-Mole, that’s what we have to keep an eye on.”She’s looking ahead to Glastonbury, which is part of what she calls her “summer of communalism”. She’ll be travelling with her family and ever-expanding caravan of friends. When she takes to the stage, that long hair billowing, she expects to be wide-eyed, taking in the crowd in front of her, and “beholding the shit out of everything”.Tickets for Alanis Morissette’s European tour are available to buyhere.In the UK,Action on Addictionis available on 0300 330 0659.In the US, call or textSAMHSA’s National Helpline at 988.

Three novels fully absorbed me recently.Fleshby David Szalay is a very smart and stylish novel about the 1%, filtered through the life of a Hungarian bodyguard/driver in their midst. Cécé by Emmelie Prophète (out 23 September) vividly depicts the slums of contemporary Haiti via a very online young sex worker who lives her best life on Facebook.Dream Countby Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie features a series of unforgettable women trying to work out what love means. The summer read I’m looking forward to myself isConvenience Store Womanby Sayaka Murata, a true original.David NichollsI would recommend two books, 800 pages and a shade under 150, depending on what you can carry.Helen Garner’s collected diaries, How to End a Story, are frank, gripping and revealing about family, marriage and the writing life, while Anthony Shapland’s debut, A Room Above a Shop, is a small, tender love story, almost a poem.View image in fullscreenBernardine EvaristoNo Small Thingby Orlaine McDonald is one of the best debut novels I’ve read in recent years. A family of women, mother, daughter and granddaughter, carry unresolved and unspoken trauma that’s passed down through the generations. This poisons their relationships and ability to fully function in society. Intense, visceral and beautifully written, McDonald’s novel captures their damaged souls.Stag Danceby Torrey Peters is the follow-up to her bestselling novelDetransition, Baby. Consisting of three short stories and a novella, this is adventurous, mind-expanding and provocative fiction that skilfully serves up different possibilities of gender and sexuality.Yael van der WoudenThe Pretenderby Jo Harkin tells the story of Lambert Simnel, the Tudor Pretender. It’sfunnyand it’s devastating. I’m having a fantastic time reading it.Katherine RundellMy favourite novel so far this year has beenJamesby Percival Everett. It has the satirical bite of his previous work, but a furious generosity that is its own. A reimagining of Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn, its premise is that the language of the enslaved is a learned facade to appease the white slavers. I read Huckleberry Finn first and then James immediately afterwards: a fantastic reading experience.Olivia LaingI savedGliffby Ali Smith for the perfect moment: the day that Keir Starmer gave his “island of strangers” speech. What a balm and a corrective, then, to read this propulsive dystopian novel about how to refuse the imperatives of fascism, how to stay open to strangers in all their guises. Beautiful and visionary.Reading about spycops might not seem the obvious beach activity, butDisclosureby Kate Wilson is a gripping account of an environmental activist who discovered her former boyfriend was a police spy, a technique regularly used to infiltrate and discredit non-violent activists. The most invigorating aspect of this disturbing book is how the women turned the tables, piecing together evidence and eventually winning a victory in court.View image in fullscreenJonathan CoeIf you’re heading to a British seaside town this summer, the book you should take with you isBirdingby Rose Ruane. Set in a desolate unnamed resort where the pastel facades of Victorian buildings “crumble like stale cake after a party”, and the pier boasts a helter skelter “crusted with stalactites of guano”, this is the bleak but hopeful story of Lydia, once one half of a fleetingly successful girl band, piecing her life back together in the face of falsely remembered trauma. Ruane is a marvellous writer whose prose glitters with perfect metaphors and wincingly caustic one-liners. In fact you should take this on holiday wherever you’re going.View image in fullscreenAnne EnrightLiterary biographies are a great choice for the summer: I raced through Frances Wilson’s whip-smartElectric Spark: The Enigma of Muriel Spark, and am currently lovingAn Afterlife, Francesca Wade’s searching and eloquent double biography of the life and posthumous reputation of Gertrude Stein. In fiction, my big recent discovery has been the work of Samanta Schweblin. Good and Evil and Other Stories is coming out in August and they are just stellar – extreme, uncanny and beautifully controlled. Also there’s a backlist for me to catch up on. Time to clear a new space on my bookshelf.View image in fullscreenSamantha HarveyAbdulrazak Gurnah’sTheftis complex in its themes of class and entitlement, but it’s also, fundamentally, a piece of great, satisfying storytelling to lose yourself in. Katie Kitamura’s latest novel,Audition, is slick, sharp, strange and singular. I love her work; she’s a writer who can conjure intrigue from the scantest detail, and you’ll gulp this novel down in one in-breath.View image in fullscreenMichael RosenKiku: The Japanese Art of Good Listeningby Dr Haru Yamada. It’s strange that when we say the word “conversation”, the first thing we think of is speakers. Yet, an equal part of conversation is listening. In fact, the speaker speaks with an eye and ear out on who the listener is and how they’re reacting. This is a great insight into how all this plays out, seen through the prism of Japanese culture and language.I’d also recommendBeyond the Secret Garden: Racially Minoritised People in British Children’s Books by Darren Chetty and Karen Sands-O’Connor. What’s it like as a child to read classic children’s books if you can’t see yourself in the garden? Or to only see yourself there as people who are “less than” the great characters and heroes? Or flip that over and ask, what does all this do for those who see themselves in books as always centre stage?View image in fullscreenColm TóibínMore than a quarter of a century ago in Sydney, I caught a glimpse across a room of the novelist Helen Garner and her companion, the novelist Murray Bail. I could hardly imagine that I would become obsessed with both of them courtesy of Garner’s marvellousHow to End a Story: Collected Diaries, all 800 pages of it. This diary begins by registering what is ordinary, how days are, what it is like to be a writer, a daughter, a mother, a lover, a citizen of Melbourne. Part of it is a doomed love story. So, I have also been reading some of the writings of the object of Garner’s attention, three short books by Bail: Longhand: A Writer’s Notebook; Notebooks 1970-2003; and his luminous and mysterious semi-novel calledHe.View image in fullscreenAli SmithIt’s a Muriel Spark summer for me. There’s the first volume of herLetters (1944-1963)edited by Dan Gunn (out 28 August); I can’t wait to read it. Brand new right now is Frances Wilson’s truly amazing biography of Spark’s formative years and work,Electric Spark: The Enigma of Muriel Spark. An electrifying work in itself, often as mazy and gripping as a psychological thriller and as unsettling, sharp and playfully uncanny as a piece of Spark’s own fiction, it’s also one of the most revealing books about societal postwar paranoia and nervous fracture I’ve ever read. My other summer recommendation is also a touch Sparkian in a world distracted by fakery: Nell Stevens’s marvel of a novelThe Original, a story of creativity, legacy and real worth, is full of narrative cunning, narrative goodness. What a very good heart it has.View image in fullscreenMick HerronIf poetry on the beach appeals – and why wouldn’t it; it sounds like a cocktail – Michael Longley’sAsh Keys, published shortly before hisdeath in January, is strongly recommended. Selected volumes are intended to provoke new readings of familiar poems, and this one works superbly – I had undervalued his later verse, thinking it slight in comparison to earlier work. This proves me wrong. Abigail Dean’s third novel, meanwhile, continues her winning streak, confirming her aptitude for examining the aftermath of trauma.The Death of Us, a love story interrupted by violent intrusion, is moving and deeply impressive.View image in fullscreenCurtis SittenfeldAnimal Instinctby Amy Shearn is a delicious, sexy, insightful, big-hearted joy (that, believe it or not, features both the pandemic and divorce). After her marriage ends, middle-aged Brooklyn mom-of-three Rachel Bloomstein goes on many dates with men and women, has wild yet as-responsible-as-possible sex, and works on creating an AI chatbot that will combine the best parts of all her romantic prospects. Rachel is so open, generous-hearted and funny that reading about her makes you feel like one of the friends who comes over for drinks on her balcony.View image in fullscreenRutger BregmanBury the Chainsby Adam Hochschild andSuffrageby Ellen Carol DuBois are two gripping accounts of what may be the greatest human rights movements in history: the fight to end slavery and the struggle for women’s suffrage. Both are powerful reminders that real change demands extraordinary perseverance. Of the 12 founders of the British Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade, only one lived to see slavery abolished across the empire. Of the 68 women at theSeneca Falls convention, just one lived to see women gain the vote – and she was too ill to cast a ballot. Their stories are a call to all of us still fighting today: for tax justice, for democracy, for an end to the moral catastrophe of factory farming, and so much more.View image in fullscreenWilliam DalrympleFara Dabhoiwala’s remarkable global history,What Is Free Speech?is ostensibly a very different book from his first, on the origins of sex, yet it shares its predecessor’s wit, fluency anddazzling erudition. Constantly surprising, it reminds us quite what an innovative idea free speech was when it was first upheld as a civilised goal in the 18th century. Examining who in history could speak, and who was silenced, Dabhoiwala reminds us of the crucial relationship between speech and power.How the World Made the Westby Josephine Quinn is one of the most fascinating works of global history to appear for years. Incredibly wide-ranging, it connects disparate parts of the ancient world with dazzling shafts of insight and intuition, held together by vast scholarship, elegant prose and an enviable lightness of touch. It completelyreframes our conception of the western classical world, allowing us to understand just how globalised and interconnected mankind has always been.Finally, Pankaj Mishra illuminates the darkest of landscapes inThe World After Gaza. It is as thoughtful, scholarly and subtle as it isbrave and original. By a long way the most horrifying and thought-provoking book I have read this year.View image in fullscreenSarah PerrySarah Hall’s new novelHelm(out 28 August) is incandescently good (even by her incandescent standards). It spans thousands of years up to the present day, and concerns the Helm wind, a phenomenon that blows down from a Cumbrian hilltop and wreaks mischievous havoc. There are meteorologists and stone-age women visionaries and peculiar unbiddable girls and terrifying medieval priests: it is sexy and funny and erudite and strange, and the prose is dizzyingly good. Up there with her best.I’m also looking forward to reading Mic Wright’sBreaking: How the Media Works, When it Doesn’t and Why it Matters. Wright is always excoriatingly funny and righteously indignant: this promises to be all those things and more.View image in fullscreenNussaibah YounisJen Beagin’s clever, hilarious and absolutely bonkers novelBig Swisswill have you laughing out loud and questioning everything you think you know about trauma. Greta, a middle-aged woman fleeing her past, takes a job with therapist Om, transcribing his therapy sessions. But this is small town Hudson, and Greta soon bumps into voices she recognises. When she develops an obsession with Om’s sardonic and larger-than-life client Big Swiss, shenanigans ensue.Stag Danceby Torrey Peters, a quartet of stories, covers utterly original ground, and will keep you captivated with its voice, energy and wit. There’s a hormone-inhibiting virus forcing cis people into parity with trans people; there are two loggers in the 1900s battling for the affections of the axeman-in-chief; there’s a sexually confused boarding school love story; and a trans fetishist competing for legitimacy with a trans traditionalist. And, randomly, there are a lot of pigs.View image in fullscreenFlorence KnappKakigori Summerby Emily Itami follows three sisters as they briefly return to their childhood home on the Japanese coast. It’s a book about belonging, often explored through language, with piercing observations around a family’s shorthand, a grandmother’s admonishments, and how the peculiarities of Japanese and English culture are highlighted in the words that are absent, and uniquely present, in our vocabularies. It is funny, gentle and warm, though Itami’s sentences are never fluffy. And it contains one of the best descriptions of overthinking I’ve ever read: “the inside of her head is like the final note of some operatic calamity vibrato-ing without end”.View image in fullscreenPeter FrankopanI greatly enjoyed Oliver Moody’sBaltic: The Future of Europe, which provides revelatory coverage of a region that is not only important but looks likely to be the next arena for competition between Russia and its neighbours. Patrick McGee’sApple in China: The Capture of the World’s Greatest Companyis terrific too – not only charting Apple’s rise but also that of China’s tech sector and its economy as a whole. McGee argues that Apple helped Make China Great Again. I also admired Bijan Omrani’sGod is an Englishman: Christianity and the Creation of England– a finely judged and beautifully written account.To explore all the books in the Guardian’s summer reading list visitguardianbookshop.com.

It’s brutal, cruel and, sadly, brings back the animal-mask wearing VIPs whose season one appearance caused global mockeryRhik SamadderSat 21 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareLook alive –Squid Gamereturns this week! There’s still no sign of any squid, which is the kind of false advertising that ruined The Pink Panther. But that’s good, because squid are terrifying. Once, showing off on holiday, I offered to cook for a group of friends. I didn’t speak the language where we were, and ended up leaving the fishmonger with a big bag of tentacles. As I attempted to remove the head, guts, beak and skin of the creatures, their internal sacs burst, coating me in viscous black ink. I suffered an allergic reaction, don’t eat squid any more, and don’t see those friends.Squid Game the TV show (Netflix, Friday 26 June) has proved even more traumatising. Set on a hidden island, the competition pits hundreds of desperate, indebted people against each other in a series of children’s games. The winner gets millions, while the losers are executed by guards, or die via gruesome, in-game accidents. The show’s brilliance is the way it amplifies the emotional stakes of each set-up. Players bond, form alliances, then have to murder each other to survive. The weak are ganged up on, cowards exploit loopholes in the rules to screw over everyone else, while those who make selfless choices are punished. Usually.It’s hard to discuss Squid Game without spoilering it to Buckaroo. It is such an enclosed world, a Jenga puzzle of individual choices and group consequence. This third, final series was intended to be part of the second, and filmed back to back. Which is to say, don’t drop in here if you haven’t seen the first two. It’ll still be upsetting, it just won’t make any sense.Let’s speak broadly of the characters, voluntary kidnappees on a starvation diet. The winner of the first Squid Game, who re-enteredthe secondto take revenge on its creators, is now dealing with the fallout of a failed insurrection. They spend much of their time chained to a bunk, looking more haunted than a Coney Island funfair. Their nemesis is the Front Man – an overseer who wears a voice-distorting mask and looks like Kryten fromRed Dwarfdipped in petrol. Other players include a drugged-up psychopath, whose simple pleasures involve watching the light fade in the eyes of the dying. There is also a mother and son, who probably won’t get to stay on the same team. Very upsetty, no spaghetti.Sadly, the VIPs also recur. Members of a wealthy elite, who created the tournament for their amusement. Wearing golden animal masks to make it crystal clear they are ciphers of decadence, they spectate from a neon pot-planted chamber, betting on who lives or dies. Imagine if the participants of Kubrick’sEyes Wide Shutran a board game night. These flimsy characters deliver dialogue so wooden it could have fallen off the back of a Jewson’s lorry. If our world has shown us anything, it is that the evil billionaires are not lazy, grape-eating emperors. They are narcissistic businessmen who get up at 4am to ruin the entire world, not just one small island.View image in fullscreenStuck in the middle … Lee Jung-jae as Seong Gi-hun in Squid Game season three.Photograph: ./NetflixI’m also less engaged by the storylines of organ-harvesting guards, or the ongoing efforts of detective Hwang Jun-ho to locate the island and find his missing brother. Squid Game is compelling because of its games. These diabolical tests plumb the depths of avarice and selfishness, or offer occasions for self-sacrifice and stoicism, depending how they’re played. “Do you still have faith in people?” is a question the overseer poses the hero, who stands on the precipice of an impossible choice. As characters, they embody opposite answers.Game theory, a branch of mathematics that analyses competitive strategies between rational actors, has proved that cooperation outperforms exploitation. In other words, it’s in all our interests to not be bastards. The problem is people are not rational; and having a gun to their heads tends not to help. Moreover, you know what a few rotten apples do to a barrel. This is why Squid Game grips us – we’re afraid of who we really are. We need to be shown ourselves, in the least flattering mirror, yet still be shown not all bad.What will the show’s verdict on us be? There is such cruelty in its premise, vivid glee in its sadism, and previous seasons have hardly ended on an upper. But the game’s not over till it’s over. Let’s see, through a squid darkly.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherSquid GameTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the 90s romcom reminded me that I didn’t have to settle for anyoneAs told toKitty DrakeSat 21 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareWhen my boyfriend proposed, I said yes – not because I was madly in love with him, but because it seemed like the correct thing to do. We’d been together for eight years and all of our friends were getting engaged; my life felt like a constant cycle of hen nights. I knew something was wrong but I suppressed it. Sometimes I’d get these flashes of anxiety. I’d worry about the fact that I no longer felt excited when my boyfriend walked into a room, or that we didn’t have sex any more – but I was 28, which at that point felt ancient to me, and I was frightened of being alone. I told myself I was experiencing nothing more than a classic case of pre-wedding jitters. I threw myself into buying the big white dress and designing the invitations. I planned to stash a bottle of gin in the church, so I could have a shot to calm my nerves before I walked down the aisle.About three months before the wedding, I was home alone one evening and decided to watchSleepless in Seattle. It was my father’s favourite film – he loved the classic jazz soundtrack and Nora Ephron’s dialogue. It had been on in the background a lot during my childhood and teenage years, so I was expecting it to be a comfort watch; something to almost lull me to sleep. I’d remembered the film as being about a man (Tom Hanks) and his cute son grieving the death of his wife. But that night I interpreted the film completely differently. I was sucked into the perspective of Meg Ryan’s character, Annie, who is engaged to a perfectly decent but slightly boring man – and deciding whether or not to call it off. I’d always seen Sleepless in Seattle as being about bereavement, but that night on my sofa, it felt like a film about one woman’s decision whether to get married, and play it safe, or give it all up and take a leap.My wedding venue was booked, the deposit paid. But as the film went on I began to feel this overwhelming sadnessThere’s a scene towards the beginning where Annie is trying on a wedding dress at her family home. Her mother is talking about the “magic” she felt when she first laid eyes on her own husband, and Annie’s face just goes completely blank. You can tell she doesn’t feel anything close to “magic” with Walter, her fiance. Watching that scene, I felt the familiar squirm of panic, but I squashed it down. I did love my boyfriend, in a way. We trusted each other and were good friends and he cared for me. I told myself: I’m not going to be the person who has the magic, and I’m OK with that. I’m going to be the person who has a sensible, kind husband, and children, and a life that is beautifully mapped out.But as the film went on I began to feel this overwhelming sadness. My wedding venue was booked, the deposit was paid – but watching Annie agonise over whether or not to leave Walter, I began to realise that the way I was feeling about my own wedding couldn’t be ignored. Right at the end, Annie tells Walter about her doubts, and he has a line that illuminated everything for me: “I don’t want to be someone that anyone settles for.Marriageis hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn’t it?” I realised, listening to that, how selfish I was being. My boyfriend was good and generous. He didn’t deserve to be “settled” for. He didn’t deserve to have a wife who had to get drunk to force herself down the aisle.That night when he came home, I said I wanted to postpone the wedding. I wasn’t brave enough to outright ask to call it off, but he told me that if I didn’t want to marry him now, he didn’t want to be with me. I like to think perhaps he was having doubts too, but wasn’t able to voice them – I hope that’s true. I emailed all of our guests and told them that the wedding was cancelled, and people were generally supportive. I remember being so grateful that I didn’t have to “face” anyone. I could call the whole thing off while hiding behind a screen. I told my father thatSleepless in Seattlehad inspired me to make the decision, but I kept that part a secret from everyone else in my life. He understood, but I suspected other people would think I’d gone mad.I spent about 11 years being single after the breakup, so I definitely had to face my fear of being alone. Often it was hard, feeling like a spare part at my friends’ parties, but as I got older, being “coupled up” and safe lost some of its allure. I saw the cracks in the marriages around me, and I realised coupledom doesn’t actually insulate you from loneliness. I am married now, but I don’t completely buy into the idea that there has to be “magic” in a romantic partnership. I don’t believe in the Disneyland, mind-altering, life-completing version of romance – that part of Sleepless in Seattle just doesn’t ring true to me. But I still believe you should never settle for anyone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In this series, Serena tells her own story – though, of course, Venus chips in. The opening episode looks at the influence of their father Richard, who saw tennis as his family’s passport out of Compton. But Serena initially had other ideas: she is a Green Day fan and fancied herself as a punk guitarist. “All my dreams weren’t on the tennis court,” she says.Phil HarrisonOasis at the BBC8.35pm, BBC TwoWith their reunion concerts looming, what better time to revisit the couple of years when Oasis felt furiously essential.

It mined laughter from a difficult period in his life – he’d lost his mum, had a stroke and struggled with infertility. Sadly, a cancer diagnosis was just round the corner, which gives the show added poignancy.PHFilm choicePiece By Piece, 8.25am, 4.20pm, Sky Cinema PremiereWe’ve had Robbie Williams played by a CGI chimp so why not Pharrell Williams as a collection of small plastic bricks? This weird but joyous documentary from Morgan Neville uses Lego to encapsulate the life of the wildly successful Neptunes producer and musician. Williams having synaesthesia – he experiences sound as colour – means the film can go off on visual flights of fancy; the beats he creates becoming rainbow fireworks or vibrant waves. All this trippy imagery covers up the fact that his rise to stardom has been fairly frictionless, but contributions from Lego versions of Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg et al attest to his offbeat worldview and hyperactive creativity.Simon WardellSaint Omer, 9pm, BBC FourView image in fullscreenA murky, moving courtroom drama … Saint Omer on BBC Four.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyWhy would a mother leave her 15-month-old daughter on a beach to drown? That’s the central question in French film-maker Alice Diop’s murky, moving courtroom drama, as a young Senegalese woman, Laurence (Guslagie Malanda), is put on trial. Lecturer Rama (Kayije Kagame) attends in the hope of writing a book about it, but uneasy resonances with her own life – immigrant family, pregnancy, mixed-race relationship – throw her off-track. Even the evasive, inconsistent Laurence appears unsure as to why she committed such a horrific act.SWLive sportMen’s Test Cricket: England v India, 10.15am, Sky Sports Main EventDay two of the first Test in the five-match series at Headingley, Leeds, with Shubman Gill captaining the visitors for the first time.Men’s Tennis: Queens, 1pm, BBC TwoThe semi-finals of the grass-court tournament at Queen’s Club.Racing: Royal Ascot, 1.30pm, ITV1The final day of the meet, featuring the Jersey Stakes at 4.20pm.International Men’s Football: European Under-21s Championship, 4.45pm, Channel 4The first quarter-finals, as the winners of Group C face the Group D runners-up.

But is it a seven-minute stunt worth waiting for?Emma JohnSat 21 Jun 2025 06.02 EDTLast modified on Sat 21 Jun 2025 06.42 EDTShareMove over Romeo: theatre’s second most famous balcony scene has stolen the show.Every night this week Rachel Zegler has emerged halfway through Jamie Lloyd’s production of Evita at theLondon Palladiumto sing its biggest number to the Oxford Circus crowds. Last weekend the Hollywood ingenue was serenading surprised shoppers, but since her performance of Don’t Cry For Me Argentina went viral it’s become the hottest (free) ticket in the West End.Some stand in wait for two hours to catch the seven-minute scene. But what is the experience actually like – and is it worth hanging around for?View image in fullscreenOnlookers capture Zegler’s performance on their phones from Argyll Street in London’s West EndPhotograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAOn Wednesday night, the crowd was a mix of musical theatre fans and Rachel Zegler stans. Most were in their 20s and 30s, although an older couple on holiday from Nebraska had been sent along by their daughter, and Susan, who had been there longest, was a 76-year-old who had seen the original production with Elaine Paige.“We’re both interested in the accessibility of the arts,” said 25-year-old Sian, who had come with her drama-school buddy. “I don’t know the show, but I know that the context of the song is her singing out to the peasants. And we’re the peasants!” That sense only increased when theatregoers stepped out during the interval to video the ticketless hordes on their phones.Some in the crowd had already seen the show and were returning for an IRL version of the performance they had watched on screen inside the playhouse. “Evita’s my favourite musical and I’ve seen a number of productions,” said 37-year-old Rowena. “But this one’s really cleverly done: the staging’s very bare, no props or decoration really, but they do a lot with it.”Don’t cry for me, all you boozers! The trouble with shifting Evita’s big balcony number from stage to streetRead moreAround 9pm a stagehand emerged on to the balcony to unleash the long-armed camera that would capture the images projected to the audience inside. A dozenchorus members costumed in athleisure emerged on to the street and hush descended as their faces were dabbed by attendant make-up artists. “I’m actually not ready for this,” a young man whispered. “My heart is pounding.”A few moments later the song’s intro piped over the speakers – its familiar melody sung out by strings – and Zegler glided across to the centre of the balcony with a blond updo and huge diamond clusters glittering from her neck and ears. She looked out over the crowd tenderly, and a little searchingly, as if looking for connection, before beginning with those iconic lines: “It won’t be easy, you’ll think it strange …”It’s a famous song that’s been interpreted in different ways by stars from Patti Lupone to Madonna. Zegler’s voice has a clarity and innocence well suited to its frequently ingenuous lyrics. Her tiny Disney princess hands clasped the edge of the iron railing and there was even a Snow White smile. But you felt a sense of Eva Perón’s egoism and manipulation as the diva gestures – the regal wave, the arms to the sky – took over and Game of Thrones lovers may have found themselves having Daenerys Targaryen flashbacks.View image in fullscreenHundreds gather to watch the seven-minute song, which is livestreamed on to a screen for the audience in the theatrePhotograph: Ian West/PABy the end she was turning away from us to secure her closeup, proclaiming “Every word is true” even as flutes trilled laughingly in the background. The crowd’s whooping and applause became as much a part of the performance as the chorus’s accompanying hums. By the time Perón was spouting her Robin Hood lies about stealing from the oligarchs for the good of the people, Argyll Street was screaming its approval.The fact that the road remains open as a pedestrian thoroughfare during the performance added colour, with passersby approaching door staff to ask what on earth was going on. And the speed of dispersal when Zegler returned inside was theatrical magic: the street transformed from the Casa Rosada back to a grimy shortcut to the tube in a Cinderella instant.Nina, from Argentina, was one of the handful of ardent fans who stuck around a further hour to join the secondary crowd of autograph-hunters by the stage door after the show. She was impressed by Zegler’s pronunciation, and wished she could see the whole production. But all the cheap tickets for under-30s were sold out, and the rest were too expensive.Explore more on these topicsStageMusicalsLondon PalladiumCelebrityWest EndTheatreJamie LloydfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are also a good excuse to meet up  with family and friends for a party in the forestJohnny GreenSat 21 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareTowards dusk a bonfire was lit and, one after another, the friends we were eating and drinking with hurdled the leaping flames, a pagan ritual thought to provide benefits including improved physical and mental strength, prosperity and fertility.Further heat came from a sauna we made using five sacks of logs – too many, we agreed afterwards. When it got too hot, we escaped into the cool shallows of the pond just a few metres away, repeating this cycle several times.View image in fullscreenAs we soak up the long, light days of summer, I’m reminded of this magical time I spent in Lithuania celebrating the summer solstice, or Joninės as it’s called there. A suitable translation is Saint John’s festival, a public holiday celebrated each year on 23 and 24 June. The name pays homage to John the Baptist and coincides with his feast day, yet the traditions of Joninės are deeply rooted in the pagan celebration of midsummer, predating Christianity.View image in fullscreenSwimming in a pond near Čiobiškis, during midsummer solstice.Photograph: Johnny GreenSimilar pagan festivals take place in the Baltic nations of Estonia and Latvia, known as Jaanipäev and Jāņi,respectively. It’s a time when people travel from the city to gather in the countryside to eat, drink, sing and observe ancient folk traditions relating to fertility, harvest and renewal.I travelled by train from Tallinn to Riga, and on to Kaunas, Lithuania’s second-largest city, to meet my girlfriend, Jūratė. From there, it’s a further 50 miles east to just outside Čiobiškis, where we meet Jūratė’s extended family – about 80 of them, from newly borns to octogenarians, of which Julė is the elder and true matriarch presiding over the Joninės celebrations.A short drive through the forest brings us to what resembles a bespoke and bijou festival, laden with copious amount of food and drinkThe journey from Čiobiškis to the surrounding countryside requires us to take the smallPadaliai-Čiobiškis ferryacross the Neris river – travel at its most rustic and serene. This is followed by a short drive through a forest, which brings us to what resembles a bespoke and bijou festival, with family members having travelled from across Lithuania and beyond, all of us laden with copious amounts of food and drink for the two-day celebration.It’s beautiful countryside – fairly flat and wooded, full of waterways providing an abundance of blue mixed with the verdant hues of surrounding vegetation, and punctuated with bright, colourful splashes from the many species of wildflower, such as lupin, cornflower, chicory, yarrow and buttercup.We watch the Neris meandering downstream to the right, and two fishermen, Julius and Česiukas, attempting to catch a trout, perch, bream or perhaps salmon for the table. Meanwhile, Jūratė and her friend Eglė collect small posies of wild flowers to weave into flower crowns, symbols of love and fertility, while I rest on the riverbank enjoying this bucolic scene.View image in fullscreenA summery sunset in Kaunas.Photograph: Airimas Vasiliunas/Getty ImagesAt the centre of the celebrations, beneath a huge structure created from local timber, tables have been joined together to form one great community banquet, flanked by benches on either side. It’s here I taste the intriguing-lookingšakotisfor the first time – a layered cake resembling a tree, made of butter, eggs, flour, sugar and cream, and cooked on a spit. Its jagged spikes look almost too sharp and angular to eat, but it’s delicious.Dishes brought by Jūratė’s family include salted herring, chanterelles spread on rye bread, a beef and vegetable stew which is very much to my liking, and a boiled tongue wrapped in smoked pig’s ear, which is less so.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My favourite isbalandėliai, cabbage leaves filled again with pork mince and served with potatoes. It’s hearty fare for the longest day of the year, washed down with the exquisite cherry liqueurŽagarės.As another bonfire is lit, everyone gathers around the campfire to tell stories and sing traditional folk songs. It is believed that the brighter the flames, the more abundant the harvest will be. Beer, oralus, is in plentiful supply, but the more pagan among us opt for homemadesidras(cider) or the stronger stillsamanė(moonshine) all of which helps make camping a little more comfortable.A further ritual begins from midnight: the search forpapartis, a fern that, legend has it, produces a magic white flower on midsummer eve. Couples wander into the forest to hunt for this mythical bloom, discovering, perhaps, far more besides. I’m told the most common date that babies are born is 25 March, some nine months later on Gandrinės or Stork Day – with the arrival of the country’s national bird signifying the beginning of spring as they return from their winter migration.Yet another name for summer solstice is Rasos, or Dew festival, since it is believed that dew collected on the morning of midsummer is especially potent for fertility, while wild herbs gathered on the night of Joninėsare believed to possess magical and healing properties, since this is when nature is at its most powerful.View image in fullscreenJūratė (right) and her cousin Simona (left) wear flower crowns on family land outside Čiobiškis in Vilnius county.Photograph: Johnny GreenWhile paying our own dues to some of the ancient traditions, we also do things our own way, combining music from the radio station LRT Opus with further consumption ofalusand Žagarės.I’m sure every family and group of friends celebrate differently, but all that really matters is being together, in nature, with skylarks visible high above and cuckoos audible in the woods.The magnificence of Joninės was captured by the Lithuanian poet and philosopher Vydūnas, who described it as the “feast of the bonfire light meeting the all-encompassing sunlight”. As we make our way a few miles south to the hamlet of Mikalaučiškės for a gathering with some of Jūratė’s friends – since Joninės is very much about celebrating with friends as well as bloodlines – I think of those words written by Vydūnas a century ago. Today’s bonfire is already burning bright amid an everlasting twilight of deep orange, pink and blue, painted above the horizon.Baltic Gentlyorganises various Joninės packages across Lithuania, from €75 to €130Explore more on these topicsLithuania holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Six years ago we were living in a tiny apartment in Sydney’s inner west, and I was paying extra for a studio. It wasn’t sustainable so we decided to move to Katoomba, on the traditional lands of the Dharug and Gundungurra people.I read an article recentlysaying something like “skip it, it’s not at its best” but Katoomba has a beautiful authenticity, even if it’s not quite polished.Our closest upper mountain towns are Leura and Blackheath. Katoomba is all old-world treasures and beautiful building facades. Blackheath has the incredibleVictory Theatre Antique Centre, Gleebooks,Hat Hill Records & Audioand great rock climbing and hikes. Leura has an upscale main drag full of lifestyle and fashion stores, but it gets busy on weekends. I recommend walking the backstreets to see the cute cottages and gardens.FoodView image in fullscreenCake and Australian wine at Tempus Katoomba.Photograph: Maja Baska/TempusOur favourite place to eat is the award-winningAtesin Blackheath.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Honey shouldn’t just be “sweet”, though. Its taste, colour and viscosity are shaped by a range of factors – from the season it was harvested and the location, to the pollen of the plants nearby. Many cheaper options blend honey from more than one country, whereas single-origin honey is clearly labelled and typically has more distinctive, layered flavours specific to where it was produced. I’ll happily be adding a few of these into my rotation, so much so that I sense a honey-themed dinner party is on the way.The best supermarket honeyBestall-rounder:Odysea Greek pine & fir tree raw honeyView image in fullscreen£4.90 for 250g at Sainsbury’s (£1.96/100g)£3.92 for 250g at Amazon (£1.96/100g)★★★★☆Noticeably less sweet than many of the others, and with a rich and complex malty flavour and savoury notes that I really enjoyed.

The broad beans on top make a perfect garnish, because they are, in essence, fresh fava beans, while thevadouvanseasoning, although untraditional, has the same sweet, warm and earthy flavours as the fava. Then, a take on a vegan borani, enriched with coconut cream instead of the more usual yoghurt. It hits the spot with its tang, heat and sweetness, with an intense beetroot flavour from the salt-baking and a generous dollop of pomegranate molasses to add punch.Fava bean,vadouvanoil and braised broad bean dipWe buy our fava beans fromHodmedod’s, who are doing brilliant things when it comes to regenerative farming, soil health and a better food system.Prep10 minSoakovernightCook1 hr 30 minServes6¾ tsp vadouvan spice mix40mlrapeseed oilFor the fava bean dip75g fava beansA pinch of bicarbonate of soda60ml olive oil1½garlic cloves,peeled1½ tbsp lemon juice30g tahiniFor the braised broad beans5 tspolive oil⅓white onion, finely diced1½garlic cloves,peeled and sliced20gtomato(¼ small tomato),dicedA pinch of flaky sea salt1½ tsp vadouvan spice mix55g podded broad beans3 tsp water1½ tsp lemon juiceFor the crisp fava beans40g fava beans100mlrapeseed oil(enough to fill a pan by 3cm)A pinch of flaky sea saltThe night before, soak both batches of dried fava beans overnight: this should be 115g in total (75g for the dip and 40g to fry).For the vadouvan oil, whisk the spice mix with the oil on a gentle heat for about ten minutes, until it reaches 75C – check with a temperature probe. It should infuse, but don’t let it bubble aggressively or smoke.Set aside.Drain then cover the 75g fava beans with plenty of fresh water.

Drain and reserve a ladleful of the cooking water (aquafaba), then transfer the beans to a blender.Add the olive oil, garlic, lemon juice and tahini, and blend for two to three minutes, until completely smooth.

Add the diced tomatoes and salt, and cook until they break down. Add the vadouvan spice mix, the fresh broad beans and water, then cover with a lid and cook for about 30 minutes, until the beans are tender. Remove from the heat, add the lemon juice, then check the seasoning.For the crisped beans, heat the rapeseed oil in a pan until 180C, checking with a thermometer (if you don’t have one, add a cube of bread and when it sizzles, it’s ready). Carefully submerge the fava beans and fry until they stop bubbling and are crisp – a few minutes.

It was unusual behaviour from me, and more so because the sandwich in question was packed with an excessive amount of spring greens, but then, that is the genius ofBrooks Headley, chef/owner ofSuperiority Burger: like Midas, he has an ability to turn the ordinary into gold. Here, I’ve tried to recreate it by cooking down a kilo of spring greens until they are melting, soft, collapsed and buttery, before tossing them with sharp cheddar. It’s pure picnic gold.Spring greens and cheddar picnic focacciaYou don’thaveto have this on a picnic, but it really does work well, plus you can make the greens in advance and refrigerate them, provided you give them time to come up to room temperature afterwards. Buy the best focaccia you can find, or make your own – I makea 20cm x 30cm one like this(minus the garlic).Prep10 minCook30 minServes61kgbaby spring greens80g unsalted dairy butter4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil1 tsp fine sea salt100g mature cheddar, grated – I likeTicklerFocaccia, to serve (homemade or bought in)Wash the greens, shake off the excess water, then cut off the ends and compost them or save for soup – as a general guide, I cut away any stalks that are thicker than the base of my little finger. Shred the leaves into 3cm- to 4cm-wide strips.Put half the butter and half the oil in each of two large, deep frying pans and put them on a medium heat. When the butter has melted and started to foam, distribute the leaves and salt between the two pans and cook, stirring occasionally, for 25-30 minutes, until the greens have given up all hope of freshness and turned forest-black, glossy and soft. Tip all the leaves into one of the pans, toss through the grated cheese, then take off the heat.View image in fullscreenFind more than 6,000 recipes in the brilliant Feast app. Scan or clickherefor 30% off an annual subscription.Slice open the focaccia horizontally, then evenly pile the greens on the bottom half. Slap the lid on top and compress. If you like a bit of theatre, tightly wrap the focaccia in foil, pop it in a bread tin and pack with a large bread knife; once on location, turn out and slice with panache. Or, more sensibly, slice into portions before you leave and wrap individually.Explore more on these topicsSummer food and drinkMeera Sodha recipesVegetablesFoodBreadCheeseBakingItalian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
