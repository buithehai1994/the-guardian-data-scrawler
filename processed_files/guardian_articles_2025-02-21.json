Macron is a friend of mine, and I’ve met with the prime minister, he’s a very nice guy … [but] nobody’s done anything,” he told Fox News.Trump is tearing up the transatlantic alliance. Can Starmer’s US visit change the weather?Read moreHis comments came amid mounting condemnation among European leaders over his assertions that Zelenskyy is a dictator and that Ukraine began the war in 2022.Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, called Trump’s statements “wrong and dangerous”, while Zelenskyy himself accused the US president ofliving in a “disinformation bubble”.With transatlantic relations at a low, Starmer and Macron will travel to Washington next week for talks that they hope will help determine the fate of an independent Ukraine.While Macron has promised to give a blunt message to Trump about the risk of looking weak in the face of Putin, Starmer is hoping to defuse the row, including by avoiding direct reference to the president’s recent comments.One British official said: “We want to focus on the future rather than relitigating any of the disputes there have been in recent days. If the president asks our view then we will give it, in line with statements we have made. But it is always better to focus on the future rather than trying to go over arguments of the past.”Starmer’s trip comes as European leaders express alarm at having been left out of talks between the US and Russia, and at the tone of Trump’s recent remarks about Ukraine.The US president has wrongly accused Ukraine of having started the war, and warned this week in alengthy social media post: “Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a country left.”Keith Kellogg, Trump’s Ukraine envoy, sought to soften the tone on Friday,calling Zelenskyy “the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war”. But western officials worry that the vitriol of the president’s comments this week has left the pro-Ukrainian alliance of western democracies all but dead.Macron said on Thursday he would take a tough tone with the American president, warning Trump not to embolden China. “I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of President Putin. It’s not you, it’s not what you’re made of and it’s not in your interests,”the French president said.British officials indicate they will take a different tone. “Macron will be there representing the European Union,” said one. “Our role is slightly different – we want to play a bridging role between the US and Europe.”The comments reflect Starmer’s broader approach to dealing with Trump, which has been to avoid commenting on his frequent controversies and focus instead on the goals of protecting Ukraine and avoiding trade tariffs.That approach will be tested on Monday when the UK imposes new sanctions against Russia and faces a clash at the UN over whether to accuse the Russians of having invaded Ukraine.Officials say Starmer will bring up trade during his visit to the White House, arguing their countries should increase bilateral trade rather than being squeezed by new barriers.Downing Street has been encouraged that Trump has so far left Britain off the list of countries on which he is imposing tariffs, and by thewarm wordshe has used about the bilateral relationship and Starmer in particular.The prime minister will hope to use that goodwill to persuade Trump to offer air, communications and logistical support to any European troops who are deployed to protect a peace deal in Ukraine. Starmer has said the UK would be willing to offer soldiers towards a European force, but that any such deployment would becontingent on a US “backstop”to keep it safe.The prime minister will also point to his manifesto commitment to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, but officials say he is not planning to make any announcements about when or how his government will hit that target.John Healey, the defence secretary, will lay out the timetable to reach 2.5% as part of astrategic defence review later this spring, but Downing Street is resisting pressure from some in the military to increase the target further.While the prime minister hopes his diplomatic approach will help him cut through where others have failed, some are urging him to be more direct.HR McMaster, one of Trump’s national security advisers during his first term, said on Friday: “The Europeans need to come out with a clear message: ‘Whatever you do, do not give Putin what he wants upfront.’“What does he want upfront? Sanctions relief. Keep him backed into the damned corner.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsKeir StarmerDonald TrumpUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

McDonald’s responded by saying it was “not funding or supporting any governments involved in this conflict, and any actions from our local development licensee business partners were made independently without McDonald’s consent or approval”.Sales nonetheless dropped in Muslim-majority countries and McDonald’s bought back the franchises from Alonyal in April 2024, saying it was “committed to the Israeli market and to ensuring a positive employee and customer experience going forward”.While the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement does not name McDonald’s as one of its central targets for consumer boycott, it continues to support the broader “organic boycott” movement against the company.Stormzy is a vocal supporter of Palestine. In an Instagram post after the outbreak of the October 2023 conflict, he wrote: “Free Palestine … if there is ever a clear injustice in the world, no matter how big or small 100 times out of 100 I will be on the side of the oppressed.”He also performed at a benefit concert for causes in Palestine and Sudan in January 2024.The “Free Palestine” post is no longer visible on Instagram, and in his statement, published via his Instagram stories, Stormzy denied it was removed because of the criticism of his McDonald’s campaign.“I didn’t archive the post where I came out in support of Palestine for any reason outside of me archiving loads of [Instagram] posts last year,” he said. “In that post, I spoke about #FreePalestine, oppression and injustice and my stance on this has not changed.”He added: “The brands I work with can’t tell me what to do and don’t tell me what to do otherwise I wouldn’t work with them. I do my own research on all brands I work with, gather my own information, form my own opinion and come to my own conclusion before doing business.”Stormzy said he knew he had supporters “who are genuinely confused and hurt by what they think has happened … I understand it must feel disappointing and disheartening when it seems like someone you’ve championed has compromised their beliefs for commercial gain but this isn’t the case here”.The Guardian has contacted McDonald’s for comment.Among those criticising Stormzy for his McDonald’s partnership was Jeremy Corbyn’s Peace & Justice Project, which said on its website that the campaign allowed McDonald’s “to culture-wash their reputation”.Having announced festival shows in the summer, Stormzy is expected to release new music in the coming months: likely an album to follow his three previous chart-topping LPs. The most recent, This Is What I Mean, was released in November 2022.Since then he has topped the singles chart with Backbone, a collaboration with Chase and Status, and released collaborative tracks with Fredo, Raye and AP Dhillon.Explore more on these topicsStormzyMcDonald'sIsraelPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

More than a third (36%) of the organisations’ chief executives or other executive directors went to private schools.The analysis also found that 17.5% of artistic directors and more than a quarter (26%) of chief executives went to Oxford or Cambridge, compared with less than 1% of the general population.Andy Haldane, the chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts, said he was “shocked by that finding but not especially surprised”.Haldane, who is a former chief economist at the Bank of England, said: “As one of the most dynamic sectors of the economy, the creative industries will need to do a much better job of nurturing socioeconomic mobility to realise their potential.”The Guardian was able to find information for 76 leadership roles at 49 of the 50 organisations.Research by theSutton Trusthas highlighted a stark overrepresentation in the arts for those from the most affluent backgrounds, which it defined as “upper middle-class backgrounds”.The report found that 43% of Britain’s best-selling classical musicians and 35% of Bafta-nominated actors were alumni of private schools. Among classical musicians, 58% had attended university, as well as 64% of top actors.Researchers found a less stark divide in pop music, where only 8% of artists were educated privately and 20% university-educated, both close to the national averages.The number of UK students taking arts subjects has also plummeted in recent years, leading to what the Guardian dubbed a “creativity crisis” in state schools. Since 2010, enrolment in arts GCSEs hasfallen by 40%and the number of arts teachers has declined by 23%.Research last year found that about half of all A-level students took at least one humanities subject a decade ago. But by 2021-22, that had fallen to 38%, with the proportion taking arts subjects such as music, design and media studiesdropping to 24%.Figures from across arts and culture told the Guardian that perceptions of the sector as inaccessible to working-class people and the rising cost of being an artist were discouraging a generation from trying to establish themselves in creative industries.“I think the real problem is that working-class people look at the arts and think this isn’t something that people like me do,” said Knight. “There is a perception across the board that there is something about the arts that is unattainable.”Meadows, the director of This Is England, said the kind of schemes and courses to which he had access as a young artist were now too rare. “The projects that existed and were open to me have vanished from so many places,” he said.View image in fullscreenUK artists say the industry is elitist and does not appear welcoming to people from different backgrounds.Composite: Guardian Design/Getty ImagesMichael Socha, who starred recently in the Meadows drama The Gallows Pole and got his start in acting via theTelevision Workshop in Nottingham, said the middle-class environment of film and TV in the UK could be difficult to navigate. “There’s a lot of impostor syndrome sometimes,” he said. “When I get a job, like a big job, I often get quite intimidated by how elitist it is.”Happy Valley’s showrunner, Sally Wainwright, said: “When I was a kid, I remember my dad saying to me: ‘People like us don’t become writers.’ He was a headteacher and a senior lecturer at a polytechnic, but he still thought that people like us didn’t make money out of writing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The game is rigged.”Darling, the 2023 Turner prize winner, said the wider issue of access to the arts for working-class people was rooted in a lack of government support and the shrinking of the welfare state.“The problem with arts participation and diversity is that there is no welfare state any more,” he said. “The Britpop acts and the Young British Artists didn’t pay for school, they lived on the dole and had housing benefits – that was their government patronage.“Now there’s wage labour and the housing crisis, and the welfare state has become increasingly difficult to access. I was able to access the last gasps of that system, including working tax credits, while university loans hadn’t ballooned to the amounts we see now.”The award-winningplaywright Beth Steelsaid she was able to get a foothold in the world of theatre by securing a place as a live-in property guardian in London where her rent, including bills, was £135 a month. That allowed her to work on her breakthrough play, Wonderland, about the mining community in Nottinghamshire where she was raised.“It is still very rare to have contemporary regional working-class voices on these big main stages, unless it’s nostalgic,” she said. “People need to see something of themselves to think there is a possibility that they can also do that.”Steel added that schemes such asTheatre 503that she was part of need to be better-funded to allow playwrights from working-class backgrounds to focus solely on writing.Mark Simpson, the composer and clarinettist who won the BBC Young Musician of the Year in 2006, said the reduction in local and national government-supported schemes meant someone from his roots would struggle to break through in the classical world today. “The limitations now that kids from my background face are almost too high to get through,” he said.Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said: “Who tells the story determines the story that is told. So if you don’t have a diverse workforce in the arts world, then too many people’s stories will be erased from our national story … As a government, we’re absolutely determined that that is going to change.”An Arts Council England spokesperson said: “We’re very aware that people seeking to forge careers in the arts can face a range of barriers, and that social class is one of them. Our own data shows clearly that the better off are better represented in the workforce.” But they said they were confident “progress could be made” and ACE has started to track social mobility within the organisations it funds.Explore more on these topicsInequalityClass act: how the British arts are failing on diversityClass issuesTelevision industryTelevisionFilm industryClassical musicnewsShareReuse this content"

Maybe with something else.”Nearly three hours later, a male suspect approached an officer in the cordon around the memorial grounds. “He had blood on his hands and this made him very suspicious,” Nath said.The spokesperson said police arrested the man and seized the attack weapon.The victim was identified as a 30-year-old Spanish man, who was taken to a hospital.View image in fullscreenEmergency services personnel use a crane at the scene where a person was stabbed near the Holocaust memorial on 21 February.Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty ImagesThe monument, one of the German capital’s most sacred sites, commemorates the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis during the second world war.Germany’s national election campaign – in which polls suggest a far-right party could come in second place for the first time in 90 years – has been marred by a series of high-profile attacks.

I therefore took the immediate decision to cancel my speech that had been scheduled this afternoon.”The National Rally partywas bestedin France’ssnap electionlast summer by a leftwing alliance.Bannon on Thursday night fired up the CPAC crowd, where he spoke directly after Musk, the man who has eclipsed him in Trump’s circle and with whom Bannon isnot on good terms.“The only way that they win is if we retreat, and we are not going to retreat, we’re not going to surrender, we are not going to quit – we’re going to fight, fight, fight,” Bannon said of opponents, echoing Trump’sexhortation to supportersfollowing theassassination attempton him.Bannon then flung out his right arm at an angle with his palm pointing down. The Nazi salute is perhaps more familiar, especially from historical footage ofAdolf Hitler, with the arm pointing straight forward – but the fascist overtone of Bannonand Musk’s signalshas been unmistakable.The Anti-Defamation League, which campaigns against antisemitism,definesthe Nazi salute as “raising an outstretched right arm with the palm down”.“Steve Bannon’s long and disturbing history of stoking antisemitism and hate, threatening violence, and empowering extremists is well known and well documented by ADL and others,” the Anti-Defamation League wrote on X in response, adding: “We are not surprised, but are concerned about the normalization of this behavior.”Bannon, speaking to a French journalist from Le Point news magazine on Friday, said the gesture was not a Nazi salute but was “a wave like I did all the time”.“I do it at the end of all of my speeches to thank the crowd,” Bannon said.However, from video, when he shoots his arm in the brief, straight-arm gesture, then nods sharply with a smile, to audience cheers, and says “amen”, it looks distinctly different from the very end of his address, when Bannon walked about the stage saluting the audience, throwing first his right arm out, then his left arm out, in a looser gesture that looked much more like conventional post-speech acknowledgment of a crowd.Online, some far-right users suggested Bannon had made the gesture purposely to “trigger” liberals and the media. Others distanced themselves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some rightwing supporters have argued, without evidence, that the Roman salute originated in ancient Rome.Historians have found, instead, that it was adopted by the Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini in the 1920s, and then Hitler’s Nazi party in Germany.However the ADL concluded that in that group’s view Musk had “made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute”.Trump administration’s mass firings could leave federal government with ‘monumental’ bill, say expertsRead moreThe Bannon speech showcasedCPAC’s evolutionfrom a traditional conservative conference to an all-out Trump-centric rally. Bannon also spoke about the forthcoming election in 2028, prompting cheers of “We want Trump,” and saying himself: “We want Trump in 28.”The statement echoed those of Trump himself, who on Wednesday asked a crowd if he should run again, was met with calls of “four more years”, and called himself a “KING” in a post on social media. US presidents are limited to two terms.Meanwhile, Musk on Thursday brandished a chainsaw at CPAC, gloating over theslashing of federal jobshe is overseeing across multiple departments, in the face of legal challenges and protests. He called it “the chainsaw for bureaucracy”.It was handed to him on stage by Argentina’s rightwing president,Javier Milei.Explore more on these topicsSteve BannonFar right (US)The far rightMarylandDonald TrumpTrump administrationElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Clarke has filed 15 witness statements in support of his case.The court of appeal judgment noted “almost all” of the witnesses were expected to give evidence at the libel trial in March.The case before the appeal court related to a late application from Clarke’s legal team to introduce a claim of “unlawful means conspiracy”, which would have involved adding six proposed co-defendants.They include the Guardian’s head of investigations, Paul Lewis, and five other people who were journalistic sources or individuals Clarke claims were confidential journalistic sources.At a pre-trial review hearing on 20 January, lawyers for the Guardian described Clarke’s conspiracy claim and attempt to join the six co-defendants as “meritless” and “a means of trying to avoid the March trial and of intimidating and deterring witnesses”.However, in legal submissions to the court of appeal this week, Clarke’s legal team described the proposed six co-defendants as “conspirators” and accused them of being involved in a criminal attempt to “sabotage his career and reputation”.The issue before the court of appeal was not the application itself, but whether it should be heard before or after the trial.Steyn had ruled that hearing Clarke’s “conspiracy” application in the few weeks remaining before the trial would threaten to disrupt proceedings. She noted that Clarke’s application could result in an adjournment to the trial.“The nature of the claim is such that there are numerous witnesses who are due to give evidence in relation to allegations of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct. The articles, as I have said, were almost all published four years ago, and the trial has been listed for quite some time,” she said.“I accept that many of the witnesses have been anxiously awaiting it and that it has been looming over them, casting a shadow over their lives. If the trial date were to be adjourned, potentially for many months, then there is the risk that the court would not necessarily have the benefit of all the witnesses who are currently prepared to give evidence.”Steyn added she was “not persuaded” that such considerations were outweighed by any prejudice to Clarke if the application was postponed until after the trial.In the court of appeal ruling on Friday, Warby said: “If the judge makes no error of law, takes the relevant factors into account, does not overlook any relevant matters and reaches a tenable conclusion it is not for this court to substitute its own assessment.”His decision to dismiss Clarke’s appeal was supported by the other appeal court judges, Lord Justice Popplewell and Lord Justice Phillips.A spokesperson for GNM said: “We welcome the court of appeal’s unanimous decision.“Our reporting on Mr Clarke in 2021 was based on the accounts of 20 brave women. After we published our first article, more women came forward.“At trial, 32 witnesses are set to testify against Mr Clarke under oath. We look forward to the judge hearing the evidence.”Clarke has been ordered by the high court to pay the legal costs of Lewis and the five other co-defendants, whose legal representatives attended January’s pre-trial review.Clarke has denied any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing. He said in November 2023: “I have always disputed the content of the eight Guardian articles.”Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianNational newspapersNewspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

He could receive up to 25 years in prison at a sentencing hearing tentatively set for 23 April.Jurors deliberated for less than two hours on Friday afternoon, after lawyers’ closing arguments followed days of testimony that included a vivid account from Rushdie of how he was certain he was going to die at the hands of a man who rushed him on stage with a knife.Matar was also found guilty of assault on the man Rushdie was talking to on stage, Ralph Henry Reese, who was wounded in the attack.Salman Rushdie tells stabbing trial: ‘It occurred to me quite clearly I was dying’Read moreThe district attorney, Jason Schmidt, had played a slow-motion video of the attack for the jury on Friday morning, pointing out the assailant as he emerged from the audience, walked up a staircase to the stage and broke into a run toward Rushdie.After Matar’s conviction, Schmidt said such evidence “really is as compelling as it can possibly get”.“Mr Matar came into this community as a visitor,” Schmidt remarked. “And, really, it’s my job that he stays a resident ofNew Yorkstate for the next 25 years.”Seated at the defense table, Matar had no obvious reaction to his conviction. His public defender, Nathaniel Barone, later said Matar was “disappointed” but “quite frankly … well prepared for the verdict”.The shocking attack occurred more than 35 years after Rushdie, 77, the Indian-born British American novelist, was first placed under a death warrant, or fatwa, by Iranian religious leadersangry at his depictionof Islam in his 1988 novel The Satanic Verses.View image in fullscreenHadi Matar is led into court in Mayville, New York, on Friday.Photograph: Adrian Kraus/APThe assistant public defender Andrew Brautigan told the jury that prosecutors had not proved that Matar intended to kill Rushdie. Therefore, Brautigan argued that prosecutors had not proven their case against Matar.“You will agree something bad happened to Mr Rushdie, but you don’t know what Mr Matar’s conscious objective was,” Brautigan said.Matar had attacked with him knives, not a gun or bomb, his attorneys have said previously. And in response to testimony that the injuries were life-threatening, they have noted that Rushdie’s heart and lungs were uninjured.Rushdie had earlier described to the court how he was on the stage at the open-air event, facing co-speakerReese– who helped launch an organization providing sanctuary to writers exiled under the threat of persecution – and the audience, when “this assault began”.“I was aware of this person rushing at me from my right-hand side,” Rushdie recounted. “I was aware of someone with dark hair and dark clothes … I was struck by his eyes which seemed dark and ferocious to me … He hit me very hard … I saw a large quantity of blood pouring on to my clothes. He was hitting me repeatedly. Hitting and slashing.”The author told jurors that as he was stabbed repeatedly, “it occurred to me quite clearly I was dying”. He lost the sight in one eye as well as other lasting injuries.During the trial, Schmidt said while it was not possible to read Matar’s mind, “it’s foreseeable that if you’re going to stab someone 10 or 15 times about the face and neck, it’s going to result in a fatality”.Audience members ultimately pulled the attacker off, detaining him until authorities arrested him.Schmidt reminded jurors about the testimony of a trauma surgeon, who said Rushdie’s injuries would have been deadly without quick treatment.The district attorney also slowed down video showing Matar approaching the seated Rushdie from behind and reaching around him to stab at his torso with a knife. Rushdie raised his arms and stood from his seat, walking and stumbling for a few steps with Matar hanging on, swinging and stabbing until they both fell and were surrounded by onlookers who separated them.Rushdie could be seen flailing, waving a hand covered in bright red blood. Schmidt froze on a frame showing Rushdie, his face also bloodied, as he was surrounded by people.A tsunami of outrage: Salman Rushdie and The Satanic VersesRead more“We’ve shown you intent,” Schmidt said.The video evidence also picked up the gasps and screams from audience members listening to Rushdie talk to Reese about keeping writers safe. Reese suffered a gash to his forehead.A separate but related federal indictment alleges that Matar’s motivation to try to kill Rushdie was a 2006 speech in which the leader of Iran-backedHezbollahendorsed a decades-old fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie’s death.Rushdie spent years in hiding. But after Iran announced that it would not enforce the decree, he traveled freely for the last 25 years.A trial for Matar on federal terrorism-related charges is scheduled for later in US district court in Buffalo.PEN America, one of the US’s largest nonprofits and dedicated to protecting free expression in literature, issued a statement saying convicting Rushdie’s would-be killer was “an important step toward justice for this unparalleled writer”.“And [it] reaffirms that violence can never be the answer to ideas,” the statement said.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsSalman RushdieNew YorkUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

It would also mean all data was accessible by Apple, which could share it with law enforcement if they had a warrant.Earlier this month the Home Officeserved Apple a requestunder the Investigatory Powers Act, which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies, asking for the right to see users’ encrypted data, which currently not even Apple can access.After the change at 3pm on Friday, new users had no access to the ADP tool and existing users would need to disable the security feature at a later date. Messaging services like iMessage and FaceTime would remain end-to-end encrypted by default.Apple said: “We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy. Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before.“Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the UK.As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.”Alan Woodward, from the University of Sussex, said Apple’s move was “quite an extraordinary development”. The cybersecurity professor said: “It was incredibly naive of the British government to think they could tell Apple what to do.“Unpleasant a fact of life as it may be, you simply can’t tell a large US technology company what to do. You have to work with them, [practise] diplomacy – that’s what has been tried before and was working. Waving a UK law at them was not going to work.”He said Apple was sending a message that “you cannot weaken encryption for your enemies without weakening it for your friends”, and that all the government could achieve would be to make its applications less secure for UK users, while obtaining no benefit for intelligence operations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many lawyers, including at Acacia and ImmDef, had continued to represent and work with clients despite the order, saying that absurdly leaving children without legal representation could have dire consequences and would violate the ethical codes stipulated in their legal licenses.“In the past 48 hours, people appalled by the cruelty shown to migrant children sent over 15,000 letters to Congress,”saidLindsay Toczylowski, ImmDef’s president and CEO. “They demanded that legal access for unaccompanied children be restored, and that this administration protect children in their care. We are deeply grateful for their support. Now, children across the nation won’t have to face the immediate threat.”Among the children affected by this stop-work order are those who presented themselves to officials at the border without their parents and were put under the custody of ORR. Some are in foster care or in group homes.About 50% of children have legal representation in immigration court.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

You can’t do a world premiere on a streaming platform and what makes Bond official is that world premiere.”View image in fullscreenA speedboat stunt scene from The World Is Not Enough. Bond films are renowned for their real-life action scenes.Photograph: Cinetext/United Artists/AllstarMark Wooldridge, film and media director of the 007GB Fan Club, who still gets goose bumps thinking of the first time he saw GoldenEye in the cinema, said the handover of creative control to Amazon threatens what he sees as the most important legacy of the franchise – the real-life action scenes.“The Bond movies pride themselves on doing action for real with very, very minimal computer graphics or CGI,” he said. “There’s plenty of action movies that have been produced by various streaming services where as you watch it you know it’s not real … often it can be like watching a video game.”After months of speculation, it was announced on Thursday that Amazon MGM Studios would be taking over creative controlfrom long-serving masterminds Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson.One person who is positive about the takeover is Daniel Craig lookalike Steve Wright. He said he was not opposed to Amazon releasing new films straight to streaming. “I think this is a good thing because it just needs to keep reviving,” he said. “I think the big cinema experience has definitely changed and I think you just have to keep up with the times, with technology and the way people actually view films.“I don’t think they’re going to bring Daniel Craig back, so personally less great … Although technically you never actually saw him die”.Other fans remain hopeful that the move to Amazon could also give the franchise a new lease of life.David Zaritsky, the creator of the YouTube channel Bond Experience, said: “Many fear that they’re going to take the films to online streaming et cetera. I don’t think that’s going to happen. What I think they could do is create satellite mini-franchises around the characters, a series about Moneypenny, a series about Q that feeds into the movies every two years, for example.“I think it’s a resuscitation of the franchise and I’m looking forward to the next steps.”Explore more on these topicsJames BondAmazonnewsShareReuse this content"

No other German party has been as successful as the AfD on these social media platforms, especially on TikTok.View image in fullscreenKatrin Nolte, an author for rightwing media such as the Deutschland-Kurier online outlet, films content in Potsdam shortly after the announcement of the results of the Brandenburg state elections. 22 September 2024.There is an increasing attempt to push conspiracy theories and historical revisionism into the mainstream. In January, the AfD co-leader Alice Weidel falsely claimed inan online discussion with Elon Muskthat “Hitler was a communist”. The AfD has sinceinvited Musk to a campaign event, despite himmaking a gesture that was widely interpreted in Germany as a Hitler salute. In response, the artists’ group Zentrum für Politische Schönheit (ZPS)projected an imageof Musk’s gesture on to a Tesla factory in Brandenburg. Ironically, ZPS, which has repeatedly campaigned for the prohibition of the AfD, is now under police investigation for displaying unconstitutional symbols – the Hitler salute is forbidden in Germany.View image in fullscreenThe AfD decorates its election party room in the Hessian state parliament, Wiesbaden, 8 October 2023.The AfD often plays with ambiguities or statements that are close to criminal offences. The 2025 election campaign slogan,Alice für Deutschland(Alice for Germany),is strongly reminiscentof the slogan of theSturmabteilung(SA, or Storm Division, the Nazi party’s paramilitary wing)Alles für Deutschland(Everything for Germany). These are ambiguous signs, but the target rightwing extremist audiences understand them perfectly while more bourgeois voters often play them down.View image in fullscreenThe memorial stone for Habil Kılıç, a victim of the NSU terrorist cell that operated as an underground organisation, is partially overgrown by grass.

Zwickau, Saxony, 28 May 2024.Escalatingviolence andhistoricalparallelsSupport for the AfD is rising rapidly, particularly in rural areas struggling economically and with poor infrastructure, and where politicians such asBjörn Höcke, the AfD’s leader in Thuringia, andMaximilian Krah, an MEP and the party’s top candidate in the 2024 European parliament elections, are regarded as role models for many young men despite numerous scandals. Both specifically appeal to their young audiences at campaign events and on social media. Höcke, who is also considered a powerful leader of the nationalist wing within the AfD, was found guilty by a court in 2024 for using a banned Nazi slogan.Germany has had a long history of rightwing violence since the end of the second world war, and deadly attacks have continued.

Reports indicate that radicalised youths are not only consuming propaganda online but forming violent groups. These groups target minorities, political opponents and journalists, often glorifying past rightwing terrorist acts. Training camps and self-defence courses with links to far-right networks have been uncovered, where young men are trained in combat techniques under the guise of “self-protection”.

Incidents such as the recent distribution of fake “deportation flight tickets” in Karlsruhe, southern Germany, and similar actions have led to police investigations, revealing the party’s more radical undercurrents.

Polling consistently shows the US president is deeply unpopular with British voters, a majority of whom think ministers should now prioritise building bridges with the EU over the US.A YouGov poll this week suggested half of voters thought it was in the UK’s interest to stand up to Trump and criticise his actions, compared with 30% who thought it better to build a positive relationship and refrain from criticism.Voters’ desire to see Starmer channel Hugh Grant rebuking the fictional president inLove Actuallyreflects how unpopular Trump is in the UK. A More in Common poll last month found that 59% had a negative view of Trump and just 24% had a positive one, giving him a lower approval rating than any UK politician.Meanwhile, a study by the Policy Institute at King’s College London concluded there had been a reversal of public attitudes towards the EU and US compared with 60 years ago. The study, based on a poll by Focaldata, found that 53% of voters today think Britain should prioritise Europe over the US if needed, compared with 31% who chose the US. In 1967, the public favoured America over Europe by 53% to 33%.When voters were asked by YouGovin Decemberwhy they were unhappy that Trump had won the presidential election, respondents most commonly cited his criminal record and misogynistic attitudes, but also used a range of unflattering adjectives including racist, crazy, authoritarian and dangerous.Given all this, getting tough with Trump could win Starmer – whose own approval rating has plummeted since the general election – some fans in Britain. But the prime minister is keen not to rock the boat with the world’s most powerful country and its notoriously thin-skinned president.Part of the reason has to do with potential repercussions for the British economy, given the damage that would be caused by the tariffs Trump hasthreatened to impose.Equally important is British security. When Starmer travels to Washington, he will want to gently persuade Trump not to agree a hasty ceasefire in Ukraine that favours Russia, and toprovide US air coverto any eventual western peacekeeping force in Ukraine.Starmer is not the only politician walking something of a tightrope when it comes to the US. Kemi Badenoch has sought to align herself with Trump since he won office, likening her leadership of the Conservative party to his second termat a conference last week, even though attitudes towards the US president among Tory voters are divided.Trump’s adoption of the Russian narrative on Ukraine, includingcalling Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator, put Badenoch in a difficult position and elicited a carefully worded statement in which she contradicted Trump on Zelenskyy but said he was right that European countries needed to increase defence spending.As forNigel Farage, his close links to Trump and full-throated support for his agenda play well with his voter base – Reform UK voters are the only political group who were by and large happy to see Trump re-elected as president.However, by tying himself so closely to Trump, Farage risks putting a ceiling on his support, and he has alsofaced difficult questionsafter Trump’s rapprochement with Vladimir Putin.For Ed Davey, things are pretty simple: he has been able to position himself as the major party leadermost willing to attack Trump, an approach Liberal Democrat voters are strongly in favour of. This helps Davey appeal to the large numbers of Labour and Tory voters who want to see those parties take a tougher stance.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerKemi BadenochNigel FarageEd DaveyLabourConservativesanalysisShareReuse this content"

I’m in constant fight or flight.”Speaking at the end of a two-week inquest that concluded on Friday – which laid bare failings in Ben’s care and was often contradictory, complex and, as his parents see it, adversarial – Allyn said their precious memories of Ben had been taken away by the approach of the trust that runs the hospital.“Up to the point he went into Bristol, Ben was a very well baby,” said Allyn, a former Olympic athlete. “We had good memories of Ben. Over the 10 years since, they’ve evaporated those good memories, they’ve taken every good memory.”Ben was born prematurely on 17 February 2015. In April, he developed breathing difficulties and was taken to the children’s hospital, where doctors diagnosed human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a respiratory infection. He declined rapidly, had two cardiac arrests on 17 April and died.The Condons were immediately told that no postmortem examination was needed as the cause of death was straightforward. Doctors recorded acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hMPV and prematurity on his death certificate and his body was cremated. But several weeks after Ben died his parents were told that he also had a bacterial infection.A first inquest, in 2016, concluded thattwo respiratory illnesses and prematuritycaused Ben’s death, but the next year, after the Condons continued to press, the University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust admitted that afailure to give him antibiotics in a timely mannerfor the bacterial infection contributed to his death.In 2021, the NHS ombudsman said Ben died after“a catalogue of failings”in his treatment and there was an attempt to “deceive” his parents. The high court quashed the conclusions of the first inquest and a new inquest has taken place at Avon coroner’s court near Bristol.Jenny and Allyn Condon with their son Nate. Jenny was five months pregnant with Ben at the time.Photograph: No byline/Family handoutOn Friday, the coroner who has heard the second inquest, Robert Sowersby, backed the Condons’ belief that the death certificate and conclusion of the first inquest were incomplete.He ruled that a pseudomonas bacterial infection, as well as the two respiratory illnesses and prematurity, caused his death.Sowersby, the assistant coroner for Avon, stated that between 14 and 16 April consultants decided not to give Ben antibiotics. Sowersby said: “I find Ben should have been given antibiotics by 16 April at the latest,” and added that if he had been given antibiotics it would have stopped the pseudomonas infection entering his bloodstream.The coroner said some medics had a “patronising approach” to Ben’s parents and that Jenny and Allyn were not told what was going on or why and were not involved in important decisions. He said it was “hard” to understand a delay in telling them how sick Ben was.Sowersby said: “A lot of mistakes were made. The actions of various employees who were involved in Ben’s care or in subsequent investigations understandably aroused suspicion and contributed to the family’s inability to believe anything they were being told.”He also criticised how some hospital staff gave evidence to the inquest, saying they had not done all they could to help him objectively assess what had happened.He concluded: “I hope that perhaps Ben’s family can take some tiny element of pride in what they have achieved in their battle for the truth.”Jenny, 43, said: “He should have had a postmortem. If that had been done properly none of this would have happened.”Troubling evidence that surfaced during the inquest included the suggestion thattissue samples may have been taken from Ben after he died– his parents presume for testing – even though they were told that the cause of his death was so straightforward that no postmortem examination was needed.The Condons will ask the Human Tissue Authority to investigate whether samples were taken and, if it believes they were, to refer their findings to the police.Jenny said: “You’re signing a death certificate, you’re telling us there’s no postmortem needed but you’re doing your own investigations after death.”Allyn, 50, said the trust continued to “muddy the waters” during the second inquest. He and Jenny have been upset by the benches of lawyers representing the trust and medical staff. “It’s been defence, defence, defence. And it’s been awful. They have let the wholeNHSdown.”Stuart Walker, hospital managing director for UniversityHospitalsBristol & Weston NHS foundation trust, said: “We remain deeply sorry that Ben died while in our care in 2015, and for how we communicated with Ben’s family following his death.FT“We have undertaken significant learning and reflection in the 10 years since then. This learning is outlined in the independent assurance review commissioned by the trust, which provided assurance to the assistant coroner that all of that learning has been embedded.“We accept the conclusion of the assistant coroner, and I would again like to acknowledge the distress experienced by Ben’s family.”Mary Smith, the head of inquests, human rights and fatal negligence at New South Law, who represented the family at the second inquest, said: “For 10 years, this family has faced institutional defensiveness, withheld clinical records, and a disturbing lack of candour from the trust.“The psychological harm caused by the trust’s actions is profound – and entirely avoidable. These parents simply wanted the truth.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Many designers have closed their doors, or cannot afford to splash out on a show. At just four days long, London fashion week has shrunk to half the duration of the Paris shows.Cash is in short supply, but ambition and creativity are not. At SS Daley, the Harry Styles-backed brandwhose trench coats are now sold at John Lewis, the show opened with the sound of Big Ben, included “Stay Faithfull to Marianne” sweaters intribute to the late British style icon, and closed with a general clamour for selfies with front row guest of honour, the Amandaland actor Lucy Punch. Actor Debi Mazar took the stage for jewellery brand Completedworks, playing a television shopping channel hostess on the verge of a nervous breakdown, hawking the “mermaid realness” of pearl earrings while sipping a martini. At the Tate Modern, Florence Pugh opened Harris Reed’s show with a monologue in praise of “the art of dressing up”.View image in fullscreenFlorence Pugh on the runway at the Harris Reed show.Photograph: Dave Benett/Jed Cullen/Getty Images for Harris ReedBritish fashion still has status on the world stage, leveraging soft power as a revered incubator of superstar designers. London fashion week retains a strong sense of national pride accordingly, tempered with a very British dose of self-deprecation and humour. The recent high-profile appointments ofSarah Burton to Givenchy, Peter Copping to Lanvin in Paris and Louise Trotter at Bottega Veneta in Milan attest to British creatives as a highly prized resource.Steven Stokey-Daley, designer of SS Daley, made a last-minute decision to join the schedule after plans for a show in Paris last month fell through. “There is a bit of a damp spirit, an empty feeling, to theLondonschedule at the moment,” admitted the designer before his show. “The data does show that London doesn’t get the same attention [as other fashion cities], so there has been a feeling of designers evacuating a bit. But London has always been good to us, and we thought it would be nice to do something to help bring buzz.” Daley still plans to show in Paris soon. “Romantically, I love London, and we are very much about British culture. But a lot of our most important buyers don’t come to London.”A recent report by Lefty, which tracks the impact of influencer coverage on brands, reported the Earned Media Value of last September’s London fashion week at $20.9m, compared with $132m for New York, $250m for Milan and $437m for Paris.The latest SS Daley collection was a celebration of the classic British coat rack, with duffle coats, donkey jackets and trench coats. “I was interested in the political ties of the donkey jacket – of who wore that in Britain, in the 1970s and 1980s,” said the designer. The elegant trench coats tipped a hat to Burberry, London’s one remaining luxury house, where Daley’s name has been mentioned as a future designer.View image in fullscreenJewellery on display at the Completedworks show.Photograph: Joe Maher/Getty ImagesFor Anna Jewsbury, designer of Completedworks jewellery, the incongruity of using a catwalk to show jewellery rather than clothes is exactly the point. “No one expects to see an accessories designer doing a fashion show. It is a way to show people that we have a point of view, a sense of humour, that is a bit different from what other brands are doing,” she said. She joined the ranks of London fashion week designers last year “partly out of naivety – I had no idea how stressful a show would be, or the resources it would take up. But it’s such a thrill.”Some designers are cutting costs by choosing to sit out alternate fashion weeks, showing just once a year. The fashion system of having a new look each September and March, which once tied the industry to biannual shows, has fallen away in favour of a more fluid era of vibes and microtrends. Conner Ives is one of the designers choosing to show annually, returning this weekend with a show in the Beaufort Bar of the Savoy hotel, based on the 1979 Bob Fosse musical All That Jazz.Explore more on these topicsLondon fashion weekLondonFashion weeksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We have been extremely unhappy for a number of years.Our relationship has frequent conflictsover small things. When we disagree on something, I am blamed for mystubbornness or lack of empathy. Innocuous exchanges can turn into confrontations that end frequently with my partner blaming my behaviour. I have been described as moody, insensitive, immature and condescending.I have been told on a number of occasions thatI drag us down. I tried to discuss the issues with her, writing emails explaining my feelings, but I have rarely received a reply.I proposed couple counselling. We attendedfour or five sessions and when I thought we were moving in the right direction,my partner asked to stop. When I asked why she didn’t want to continue,she said that I was looking for a third person to validate my points.Confrontations can go on for hours. My partner never steps back, even when I tell hershe is hurting me. I decided some time ago to try to defuse the conflict by leaving the room when I saw where the discussion was heading. I have been told that by leaving the room I was running away.I know Ihave my shortcomings. I have explained that if she has reached the conclusion that I’m not the right person for her,we can end the relationship. She has never agreed to move in that direction.I feel stuck in a relationship that doesn’t fulfileither partner.Any advice on how to move forward would be really appreciated.There was a real sense of resignation in your letter, but also some hope because you know you want things to be different. And they can be. Whether with your partner or on your own remains to be seen. I have to say there were also elements of potential emotional abuse, which I’d like you to be aware of.I went to UKCP-registered psychotherapist Jacquie Keelan. She said: “You saying you have ‘frequent conflicts out of small things’ suggests it’s not the small things in your relationship that are the real problem, but the themes that underlie them. These can actually be about power imbalance, or lack of respect or care.”These “small things” clearly have roots elsewhere and it might be worth digging deep to work out what they are; counselling is the ideal way to do this. But you cannot force your partner into it, so why not consider going alone where your voice can be heard – and validated? It’s a real shame she won’t consider it because, as Keelan says, couples counselling is not about one partner being right and the other wrong, but “‘translating’ one person to the other in turn; that is, helping each person to hear what’s really being said, not what they expect to hear or think they already know.”Always winning or being right is a short-term victory, that comes at a price in the longer term“The issue of blame,” Keelan continued, “comes across very clearly in your letter – how hurtful it is and how it closes down communication. But in reality it’s very rare that one individual is wholly responsible for the difficulties in a relationship.” It is important to try to resolve difficulties, she said. “And if we’re focused on winning or being in the right, we’re missing the opportunity to challenge old unhelpful ways of relating and resolving conflict. Always winning or being right is a short-term victory that comes at a price in the longer term.”When one partner locates all the blame (as seems to be happening here) and won’t try to resolve anything, and won’t even reply to emails (rude and very blocking), then the couple is, as you so aptly say, stuck. Maybe your partner was never allowed to be in the wrong growing up, or was severely punished, or there’s shame involved in admitting any fault. Or maybe she is afraid of looking at the reality of what your relationship has become.This is why I think individual therapy, at least as a start, would really help, because it may focus you. Unfortunately, if your partner won’t engage, you will need to think about your future.Sixty is young, and there are still many years left ahead for (both of) you, so it’s a long time to be unhappy. I’m also mindful that you have children who need to be considered. This can’t be easy for them either. Children, even adult ones, learn by the example set by their parents. That may give you something to consider. Good luck.Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

She added that “it was devastating to … feel so betrayed by the system”. She is now signed to Island, a subsidiary ofUniversal MusicGroup (UMG), and her speech seemed to be addressed specifically to major labels, whose profits have soared in recent years even as revenue for artists has gone down.Musicians including Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx and Noah Kahan have backed her, each matching a $25,000 donation she made to the music mental-health charity Backline, but her speech was also met witha scathing op-edby Jeff Rabhan, a former chair of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music in New York, who called her comments misguided. His piece was widely maligned, but was symptomatic of an industry fretting at the prospect of its longstanding labour practices being revolutionised by artists.Chappell Roan accepts her award for best new artist at the 2025 Grammys – video.Stories of overwork, poor mental health and precarious contracts are common among artists; fresh concern over pastoral care has been triggered by thedrug-related deathof the singer Liam Payne, who was dropped by his label amid his addiction struggles. Jillian Banks – AKA pop musician Banks – found success in the major-label system with her first two albums in the mid-2010s, and says that, as a major-label signee you are “not really viewed as a sensitive human that creates art – you’re now a product, and so they are viewing everything through the lens of trying to make you make money for them”.She describes the label-mandated schedule she had to adhere to early in her career as “essentially inhumane – it was every day, interviews and shoots all day long, flying here and there … if you said you weren’t OK with it, there was always some sort of backlash”. Eventually, she had to begin cancelling promotional opportunities because of burnout.View image in fullscreenBanks describes the label-mandated schedule she was subjected to as ‘essentially inhumane’.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianJoey DeFrancesco, co-founder of the United Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW) group, says that labels “should certainly be providing benefits” like healthcare to artists such as those in the development stages of their career. “[Those artists] are often signing contracts where the artist is working for this label in an extremely full-time capacity – the label is providing the PR, the booking agents, all these parts of a musician’s life, so the artist is very much working for that label,” he says. “In such circumstances where you’re working full-time for an employer, the employer is supposed to give you benefits. But so often what happens is that employers intentionally misclassify employees as independent contractors or freelancers, not technically employees under legal definition, [so they] don’t give them benefits.”Musicians signed to UMG, Sony Music Entertainment (SME) and Warner Music Group (WMG) – the “big three” major labels – and their subsidiaries qualify for insurance through the Sag-Aftra union throughout the period that they are signed with the label. UMG and SME also have partnerships with the Music Health Alliance (MHA), a non-profit organisation that provides musicians with healthcare advocacy and support at no cost. (In some cases, this may be offering assistance in applying forMedicaid.)Last week,UMG announceda further partnership with MHA called the Music Industry Mental Health Fund for UMG artists and the broader industry. It’s certainly necessary: the UK mental-health charity Mind says that musicians are up tothree times more likelyto suffer from depression than non-musicians, owing to the insecure nature of their income, pressure from fans and labels, and access to alcohol and drugs. (Representatives from UMG and SME declined to comment on the record; reps for WMG were not immediately available for comment.)This coverage does not account for Roan’s appeal for broader artist support, including for those who may be tied up in development deals that ultimately result in contract termination. David Airaudi, manager of indie-pop star Steve Lacy and author of forthcoming artist handbook Made Art, says “There [have] to be systems in place to take care of the artists that drive our business,” but that “we’ve gotten so far away from that over the years.”“It’s profits over people – when you put for-profit entities in charge of products that are the result of human suffering, trial, toil and soul, you’re going to get a disconnect,” he says. Airaudi says that putting the onus on labels to provide this kind of support shifts focus away from an industry-wide problem, in which overstuffed touring schedules can become “incredibly taxing”, resulting in mental-health issues; and where managers don’t always teach financial literacy to their artists.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Following Roan’s Grammys speech, the UK songwriting groupIvors Academyannounced plans to lobby for better treatment of songwriters, including label-funded daily expenses, minimum royalty cuts from master recordings to songwriters, and more. Early last year, Rashida Tlaib and Jamaal Bowman introduced a bill to the US Congress called theLiving Wage for Musicians Act, which would require streaming services to introduce a subscription fee that would go directly to artists and to put a percentage of non-subscription revenue into a new royalty fund which would pay out directly to musicians. (UMAW worked on the bill with Tlaib and Bowman.)Earlier this week, industry executive Troy Carter – an early manager of Lady Gaga – pledged on Instagram that his label, Venice, would write healthcare stipends into its contracts, although it’s unclear whether Venice has any signees or operates beyond distribution services.Nearly a third of professional UK musicians report poor mental wellbeingRead moreBoth DeFrancesco and Airaudi say that there will always be musicians who fall through the cracks of any industry-wide pushes for healthcare, and that ultimately such initiatives are stopgaps for a country without a centrally funded national health service. “The vast majority of UMAW members are not on major labels,” says DeFrancesco. “We need musicians, like all workers, to be demanding better healthcare from their employers, but also getting organised politically to defend the Medicaid that we have right now and then expand it further into that single payer system.”In the meantime, says Banks, major labels don’t seem willing to budge on their treatment of musicians. “The way the culture is set up, it’s kind of about quantity over quality, where everything’s about money and a major label can sign an artist for one song, and if it doesn’t work out, let’s move on to the next,” she says. “If they were to actually develop artists, they would have to invest in healthcare.”Explore more on these topicsMusicMusic industryPop and rockChappell RoanMental healthUniversal MusicMedicaidfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Amid the recent gloom, struggles and doubts besetting Britain’s railway there is a bright beacon of hope: the Elizabeth line.Now accounting for one in seven national rail journeys, the east-west cross-London railway has smashed forecasts and remoulded the travel habits and urban geography of the south-east.So far, so good for the lucky Londoners upgraded from the tube to a far quicker, cleaner and quieter ride. But beyond, with the north of England still waiting for promised better railways, and a chancellor beating the drum for infrastructure investment, the line serves to demonstrate that the nation can indeed still build things, and that the people will absolutely come.Last month the Elizabeth line reached a milestone of 500 million passengers since itopened in May 2022. That figure has all but restored rail’s official passenger numbers to pre-Covid levels, fuelling the belief of those in the industry who forecast usage would boom again.The well-heeled commuters from the stockbroker belt who once poured into London are yet, if ever, to return in pre-pandemic numbers, but the Elizabeth-line stations of Liverpool Street and Paddington have overtaken Waterloo in the list of Britain’s busiest.From Paddington’s smart office development in west London, to houses, jobs and conferences landing near new stations at points east, such as Woolwich and Thamesmead, regeneration has been the story of the line.graphicIn recent reports published byTransportfor London (TfL) and the engineering consultancy Arup analysing the line’s impact – based on data that was yet to capture the full swell of passengers – more than 90% of customers said it had changed their area for the better. Nearly two-thirds said it had also made it easier to access jobs and employment.TfL’s analysis shows that within a kilometre of an Elizabeth line station in London, the number of new houses is 8-14% higher, and nearly 400,000 jobs have been created since 2015. House prices around the stations have alsoincreased sharply.Launching the report, London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, concluded: “When you invest in high-quality transport infrastructure it can provide huge benefits for increased jobs, growth and the new housing we need in London and across the country.”The latest TfL figures show that Elizabeth line growth continues to outstrip its budgeted increase: a 16% rise in traffic in the first quarter of 2024-25. The line’s director, Howard Smith, director of the Elizabeth line, also said it had not just improved links and capacity but “transformed accessibility”, with level boarding and lifts throughout, and “had vital economic impact across the whole country via a UK-wide supply chain”, including more trains beingbuilt in Alstom’s factory in Derby.“We will continue to focus on improving … and look forward to introducing ten additional Elizabeth line trains to support passenger demand, including at Old Oak Common when it opens as the initial terminus for HS2 services,” he said.Confidence in infrastructure building has been dented, at the very least, by theHS2 high-speed rail project’s experienceof ripped-up plans and blown budgets, but the intersection at Old Oak Common ploughs ahead. The Elizabeth line was similarlyplagued by delaysand indecision, with construction eventually finished three years late and £3.5bn over budget – which perhaps demonstrates how soon the issues are forgotten once construction is done.“It’s a step change up in technology and I think that’s what makes it so attractive, really unlike any underground railway in any city,” said Christian Wolmar, the author of The Story ofCrossrail, as the project was originally known.“When you get off the cramped tube, at somewhere like Tottenham Court Road, and emerge into these huge platforms and 250-metre long trains, this completely different world … If only we could have three or four lines like that the whole city would be transformed. We don’t quite have the imagination or the money to make it happen.”The comparatively swish functioning – from the back-end control and operations to the wide platforms, safety doors and spacious carriages – does not make it immune from all of rail’s problems. In the coming weeks it facesfour days of drivers’ strikescalled by Aslef over pay. Sharing a railway with the national network has made parts of the line to the west, in particular, as susceptible as any to delay. And being unequipped with toilets its trains are potentiallyfar worse places to be stuck,as when the overhead cables came down in December 2023.But latest performance figures – well over 90% of trains on time with less than 2% cancelled, and customer satisfaction scores comfortably exceeding the rest of the TfL network – show clear improvement along with booming ridership.About 35% of its passengers come from pure “abstraction”, in Department for Transport parlance: luring customers in from other lines, who might otherwise have commuted in on a Great Western train from Maidenhead, chugged through the West End on the Central line, or taken the far pricier Heathrow Express train to the airport. Another third of the passengers were already on TfL Rail, the outer London precursor subsumed into the Elizabeth line.But almost 30% are people who would have driven or previously decided that the journey was not worth the effort.This matters significantly for rail because investment decisions have been torn between two camps: the traditional Treasury benefit-cost ratios, which critics saw as unduly leaning towards building more infrastructure or improving connections that people already used; or the faith that better public transport will inevitably stimulate new houses, jobs and journeys.Given its location in the most populated corner of Britain, the Elizabeth line, with a guaranteed market, might never sway the first camp. Nonetheless, the appeal of better links throughout the country is visible in the success of 10 years of Borders Rail, the 30-mile Edinburgh-Tweedbank line, and the instant appeal of thenew Northumberland Line, which carried 50,000 passengers in its first month.Henri Murison, the chief executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said: “The assumptions on benefits are always wildly lower … they underestimate how transformational the projects will be.”Despite the strength of feeling onrelative underinvestmentin the north, Murison stressed the importance of focusing on the Elizabeth line’s success: “It gives an informed discussion on what’s genuinely possible: it’s generated huge opportunities in London and that’s exactly what we could generate in Northern cities with the line – you’d get significant wider investment as well.”Rachel Reeves has loosened the fiscal rules and committed to fuelling infrastructure investment, but expectations for public spending on rail are muted since the cancellation of HS2’s northern leg. Stung by a decade of inaction since what Murison terms the “grandiose commitments” ofmore than oneConservative leaderto a high-speed line across the north, steadily securing the pieces of the jigsaw – the TransPennine upgrade,a Bradford station, Manchester’s airport link – is now seen as the surer path.However long that infrastructure takes, the Elizabeth line should demonstrate that it is a prize worth pursuing. As Wolmar put it: “It shows very strongly that if you spend a little bit of extra money making the tunnels bigger and design something attractive, that brings people to it. It justifies public investment, and doing it to a decent standard.”Explore more on these topicsRail industryRail transportTransportTransport policyLondonCrossrailfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The result is a fine of more than €10,000, a ban from going within 200 metres of Hermoso or communicating with her and €3,000 in compensation to the striker.Lucy Bronze praises Spanish players for speaking out during Luis Rubiales trialRead moreHowever, Rubiales escaped a custodial sentence and was acquitted of a charge of coercion, alongside three co-defendants, for allegedly having put pressure on Hermoso to say the kiss had been consensual.That is the partial cause of the bitter aftertaste. Irene Paredes, one of the players to testify alongside Hermoso, said of the ruling: “I think the conviction for sexual assault is correct. What I find somehow striking and strange is that there is no conviction for coercion.”Hermoso’s lawyer has said she intends to appeal.Rubiales, too, has said he will appeal. Many will think that the punishment was light, with a fine that is about 1.5% of what his €675,762 salary was. His three-year ban from all football-related activity will expire on 30 October next year after his appeal against it was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport yesterday.It has been a 550-day battle to reach this point, 550 days between the kiss that shocked the world and overshadowed a heroic and historic first World Cup win for Spain and the verdict’s delivery. For 550 days, Hermoso, despite being a victim of sexual assault, has been under intense pressure. Pressure and scrutiny, for pushing back in a patriarchal society still heavily influenced by the machismo values encouraged under the dictatorship of Franco where women were expected to stay at home and have children and where feminism was essentially co-opted by the regime to encourage a faithful adherence to domesticity.View image in fullscreenJenni Hermoso said the incident ‘tainted one of the happiest days of my life’.Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty ImagesToday, attempts to grapple with the issue of sexual assault have had mixed results. The new Sexual Consent law (also known as the “only yes means yes” law) introduced in 2023, while progressive, inadvertently allowed almost 1,000 prisoners to have their sentences reduced, forcing the prime minister to publicly apologise. The UN special rapporteur Reem Alsalem “expressed concern”over the new law, called for stronger protections for the victims of sexual assault in Spain and said that “for a country with a high rate of femicide, reducing the sentences of those found guilty of perpetrating sexual violence – against women and children – sends the wrong message about the State’s priorities when it comes to ending violence against women and children and fighting impunity for such crimes”.The future doesn’t look brighter for women and girls in the country either, with a “significant” rise in sexual assaults by minors, including several high-profile gang rape cases, according to the prosecutor in charge of minors, Eduardo Esteban. Against this backdrop, the conviction of Rubiales for sexual assault, after a trial reported on around the world, is a huge step forward. It sends a powerful message not just about consent but about how seriously women are taken. But what was the cost? Hermoso said that the incident and fallout had “tainted one of the happiest days of my life” and several of her Spain teammates testified to the huge emotional impact it had had on her.Hermoso was in a position of power, a World Cup winner and Spain’s record goalscorer. She, along with many of her teammates, had complained about the federation’s treatment of the squad. It required the assault by her boss being broadcast live around the world for people to take seriously that the environment around the team was not appropriate. Even then she needed to endure a trial and hope the judge would deliver a guilty verdict. What about the women who don’t have their assaults broadcast live around the world and lack the international profile of a successful elite athlete? What chance do they have of justice?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She has paid a heavy and long-term price for the stand she has taken. The easier option would have been to toe the line, lie, say it was consensual, and have the world move on. Except, the Spanish women’s national team have a history of struggle for better conditions and treatment behind them.Time and again the team have butted heads with their federation and lost, their claims dismissed, players forced out and small rebellions brutally quashed. This time, with Hermoso’s assault viral, there could be no dodging when she sacrificed her mental wellbeing and pursued the issue.It went beyond her as an individual, her case enabling the team’s ongoing and long-term issues with a patriarchally run federation to be brought to the fore. Finally, they would be believed. That is where the rest of the bitter aftertaste comes from: the price Hermoso and the team have had to pay for minimal justice.Explore more on these topicsSpain women's football teamWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

One Red Rose win in seven attempts and four consecutive victories for Gregor Townsend’s side has certainly been an uncomfortable sequence for those who, for decades, regarded death and taxes as only marginally more inevitable than Scotland losing down south.So much for the supposed dead weight of history. “What’s done cannot be undone,” murmured Lady Macbeth but she wasn’t privy to the skill and daring of Finn Russell or the killer finishing of Duhan van der Merwe. The last time England lost three or more consecutive home games in this fixture was in the early 1900s before Twickenham became their spiritual home.Scotland happy to let England play favourites before Calcutta Cup clashRead moreThe cyclical nature of sport and sheer weight of numbers, though, would suggest an English revival has to materialise at some point. The big question is when – and Saturday, in theory, offers a perfect opportunity. Boosted bytheir thrilling win over France– and with their aches and pains nicely rested – this is theoretically a re-energised England side with their tail up.All of which ignores one niggling little word. Consistency. England have tended to be a side who wax and wane, not only from week to week or half to half but from minute to minute. Even against France they were required to ride their luck and might have been 20 points down in the first half ifLes Bleushad not seemingly been playing with a piece of soap.Last year at Murrayfield was another prime example. It is easy to forget England made an encouraging start, conjuring a lovely early try for George Furbank not dissimilar in its execution to Elliot Daly’s dramatic score against France last Saturday week. But a fumble here and a missed tackle there allowed their grateful hosts to sneak back into the contest and, thereafter, English shoulders started to drop.Small wonder a number of players have since described that wounding experience as a line in the sand. The following week they vowed that, in future, they would be bolder, stick in the fight and not roll over as easily. Aside from some frustrating autumn performances, when defensive uncertainty cost them, they have mostly stayed true to that pledge.View image in fullscreenEngland’s players vowed after last year’s wounding 30–21 defeat at Murrayfield that they would become tougher as a team.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesHence why this now feels to be a potentially pivotal stepping stone for English self-esteem and their medium-term outlook. Win again and there will be every chance of a top-twoSix Nationsfinish, their first since 2020. Succumb once again to the wiles of Russell and Van der Merwe, who has scored five tries against England in his past two games facing the “auld enemy”, and Caledonian sniggering will grow ever louder.In pursuit of extra motivation, England’s coaches could do a lot worse on the eve of this game than replay the episode of Full Contact, the Netflix fly-on-the-wall show based around last year’s Six Nations, in which a grinning Russell cheekily refers to a tartan Calcutta Cup victory as “normal” these days. It is no coincidence that Scotland’s solitary recent defeat by England, in 2020, came when Russell was absent. Wiping that familiar smile off the Bath ringmaster’s face will be high on English wishlists.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Apply pressure with and without the ball, safely defuse the restarts and slow down Scotland’s trademark ruck speed and opponents generally prosper.It is the reason why Scotland, when it comes to the crunch, have struggled to take the final title leap, even with probably their best all-round squad of the modern era. Beating England has proved much more straightforward than upsetting the Irish or the Springboks, either home or away. In terms of Six Nations consistency, the Scots have been as up and down as their neighbours.To regain the high road Townsend’s team will first need to resow a few seeds of doubt in English minds, particularly in the first quarter. For all the white-shirted determination to chase and hustle Russell and cut the supply lines to Scotland’s talented outside backs, the flipside equally applies. Marcus Smith one on one against a charging Van der Merwe? Fin Smith forced to backpedal against the land of his father, Andrew, and mother, Judith? England have 98 fewer caps in their starting XV than the visitors and have won only two of their past eight Tests.View image in fullscreenFin Smith has been handed his second Test start for England, 70 years after his grandfather Tom Elliot made his debut for Scotland in the Five Nations.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesBut what if England’s pack properly turn up? Ollie Chessum has quietly become a key cog in Steve Borthwick’s squad and his absences over the past year have been keenly felt. At lasthe is back starting at lock, intent on disrupting opposition lineout ball and generally making a nuisance of himself. With Tom Curry having started the tournament outstandingly, Tom Willis adding extra ball-carrying heft and the underrated Ted Hill now set to feature off the bench, England are unlikely to go down meekly.It is also approaching 18 months since Borthwick’s side lost to anybody by a double-figure margin and Scotland, who have rattled up at least 29 points in each of their past two victories against England, will probably need to do so again to avoid a first away loss in this fixture since March 2017. How they must wish Sione Tuipulotu and Graham were also available for what could easily be another tense thriller.Quick GuideSix Nations: England v Scotland teamsShowEngland:M Smith (Harlequins); T Freeman (Northampton), O Lawrence (Bath), H Slade (Exeter), O Sleightholme (Northampton); F Smith (Northampton), A Mitchell (Northampton); E Genge (Bristol), L Cowan-Dickie (Sale), W Stuart (Bath), M Itoje (Saracens, capt), O Chessum (Leicester), T Curry (Sale), B Earl (Saracens), T Willis (Saracens).Replacements:J George (Saracens), F Baxter (Harlequins), J Heyes (Leicester), T Hill (Bath), C Cunningham-South (Harlequins), B Curry (Sale), H Randall (Bristol), E Daly (Saracens).Scotland:B Kinghorn (Toulouse), K Rowe (Glasgow), H Jones (Glasgow), T Jordan (Glasgow), D Van der Merwe (Edinburgh), F Russell (Bath, co-capt), B White (Toulon); P Schoeman (Edinburgh), D Cherry (Edinburgh), Z Fagerson (Glasgow), J Gray (Bordeaux), G Gilchrist (Edinburgh), J Ritchie (Edinburgh), R Darge (Glasgow, co-capt), J Dempsey (Glasgow).Replacements:E Ashman (Edinburgh), R Sutherland (Glasgow), W Hurd (Leicester), S Skinner (Edinburgh), G Brown (Glasgow), M Fagerson (Glasgow), J Dobie (Glasgow), S McDowall (Glasgow).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.England may privately be thinking likewise about Furbank and Immanuel Feyi-Waboso but, with Jamie George set for his 99th England cap off the bench, the 143rd Test between the countries really should produce a narrow home win this time. Lay to rest the toil and trouble of recent Scottish disappointments and their closing fixtures, at home to Italy and away to Wales, will feel even more enticing.All that remains, then, is for England to shake off their modern Calcutta Cup blues and to start writing their own Shakespearean dramas again. The world’s oldest international fixture always has a defining quality to it, for better or worse. Back in 1955, for instance, a noted Scottish prop, the late Tom Elliot, swore he had scored a triple crown-clinching try at Twickenham only for the referee to be unsighted and England to scrape a 9-6 win. Seventy years later his grandson, the aforementioned Fin Smith, will have a red rose on his chest. Could history be about to come full circle or is this the year England finally turn their Scotch Corner?Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025England rugby union teamScotland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the very least, can we please stop comparing him unfavourably with Andy Carroll. This should be taken as a general cease-and-desist plea from those of us with an interest in preserving the Carroll legacy. But it also feels like an important note of distinction in a week when Arne Slot has unexpectedly made Núñez into a person of interest in the Premier League title race bydwelling on his now-famous missagainst Aston Villa.There may be sound internal reasons for this. Slot is very shrewd. The season has so far been an exercise in control and smart judgment. But from the outside, telling Núñez off in public feels unnecessary at this late stage, like shoehorning jeopardy into the third act of a generic Hollywood movie, the needless car chase four-fifths of the way through Paddington 5: Paddington Harder.Champions League last 16: tie-by-tie analysis and predictionsRead morePossibly, and all conclusions will as ever be outcome-based, this will end up being a significant mistake. But it’s also interesting in its own right, and for various reasons.First the Núñez/Carroll dynamic. This comparison is purely visual. Both are tall and have slick dark ponytails in the “Croydon facelift” style. The music press used to do this a lot, grouping bands together on the basis of hairstyles. Núñez-as-Carroll is like listing both Spandau Ballet and Soft Cell as New Romantics in the early 1980s.Both had quiffy, feathery haircuts. But watching an early Spandau Ballet performance is like being jostled by angry handsome plumbers shouting Marvin Gaye songs. Whereas listening to Marc Almond is like perching on a stool in a basement bar while a skinny, unsettling man sings Jacques Brel-style torch ballads dressed only in a metal codpiece and nipple clamps. Both good. Both with good hair. But contrasting vibes.In football terms the key difference between Núñez and Carroll is spatial and range-based. Carroll at his best was a set of powerful and surprisingly precise patterns enacted in a small space. Núñez, by contrast, is about creating space with unpredictable movements over a much larger area.View image in fullscreenDarwin Núñez blasts the ball over the bar from close range against Aston Villa.Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty ImagesCarroll was a footballer of the skies, which led to him being compared to many things during his career. The carcass of an ox siege-catapulted over the castle walls. A mattress thrown from a balcony on to a crowded dancefloor. But his best moments were at close-quarters and precise, from the famous header for England against Sweden at Euro 2012, perfect spatial awareness, elite neck-muscle flex, to those overhead kicks where he seemed somehow to have turned the rest of the world upside down while he remained static, a foot suddenly where his head used to be, a miracle of explosive control in a very narrow range.Núñez operates at ground level, and more expansively. There was the goal at Brentford last season where he ran 60 yards, just eating the space, and produced a finish so absurdly out-there, a floating miracle-scoop on the move, that it seemed to really upset people, to say, yes, this is frankly unsustainable. This season heproduced a winning turnat the same ground when he came late into a tight, settled game and broke it open with his more random angles.And now we have this, Wednesday night, That Miss, and Slot’s decisions to dwell on it as a significant note after the game. Is this a sign of being rattled? Probably not. Slot is super-smart. Dutch people often just say things. There may have been a dressing room imperative to employ the nuclear option of going public. Maybe being rattled is OK anyway. Football is rattling. People who win also get rattled. We just don’t hold it against them for years on the internet.Slot was also very clear it was Núñez’s perceived lack of effort afterwards that bothered him, not the miss itself. This makes sense. A Núñez who gets discouraged when he misses is basically a 1% Núñez, the butterfly-lifespan Núñez. This person cannot exist on a football pitch.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreOn the other hand is it actually wise to do this when everyone out there is looking for cracks and signs of stress, a plateauing that could, in the broadcasters’ most fevered dreams, turn into a choke-based entertainment vehicle? If Slot really doesn’t want that moment to “get in his head”, how is hearing his manager talk about it going to help with this?The real objection is that to raise it in public seems to miss what Núñez’s role is going to be in a successful title run with 12 games to go and the need to just not collapse. Asking him to be hyper-professional, shaming him in public. Is it the moment? In this situation Núñez is the spirit animal, the hype man, the goodwill mascot, there at the end, beaming and dancing and firing a champagne cork into his own eye.Núñez is also the only part of the entity Slot inherited from Jürgen Klopp that doesn’t really work properly, which adds a slight note of ingratitude. It is important to be clear at this stage. Núñez has not been a success. His transfer fee remains an absurdity.It hasn’t all been bad. He was good last season when Mohamed Salah was injured. But he is also a player who spends a lot of time sprinting away from the game, making all the right runs, just not necessarily in the right order. He misses a lot. He doesn’t have that ice-cold filter. He isn’t a good fit in a high-precision team. The Darwin-verse is a looser, chancier place. It makes him great fun to watch as a neutral, exhilarating and maddening if you’re a supporter, and a one-man heart attack if you’re his manager.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The formerLiverpooldata analyst Ian Graham wrote an interesting book about his time at the club called How To Win the Premier League. Sadio Mané (massive success) is mentioned 50 times, Salah (even massiver success) 41 times and Lionel Messi (random, but great brand recognition) 129 times. Darwin, who was signed on his watch: zero times.But then, Graham has a job to do and a company to promote, not to mention his Pitch Control model designed to “mathematically understand the game the way a professional footballer understands it”, which isn’t really going to fit here. Throw your calculator down the stairs and then stamp on it. This is the best way into the maths of Darwin’s game.View image in fullscreenDarwin Núñez is perhaps the only part of the team Jürgen Klopp left behind that doesn’t really work properly.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAGraham has pointed out in interviews that it was Klopp who made the call on Núñez based on two good performances against Liverpool. And in fairness he also admits that the data said yes, that the model had him as “one of the best young strikers in the world”.This is also significant. In many ways Núñez-to-Liverpool is a victim of modern metrics. What we have here is a set of elite physical attributes crowbarred into the outline of an elite footballer. Take his top speed, his distances covered, a rare combination of height, pace and agility. Add one good goalscoring season. It kind of makes sense in a Klopp attack, although not in a Slot team, where picking Núñez is like living in an immaculate 17th-floor apartment with an overexcited labrador who won’t stop knocking over your laptop, spraying the Barcelona chair with mud, drinking out of the toilet.This is also why Núñez is so much fun to watch. Modern football can be tediously risk-averse and systems-based. Perhaps the real lesson of Núñez is that building a team or trying to understand talent should never go too far one way into either data or feelings. An old-school Kenny Dalglish-style sniff test would probably save you from signing Núñez. The data wanglers could stop you spending £30m on Carroll.There is still a place for Núñez in this world. Probably he should be at a less overclass club, using his energy to disrupt more orderly teams. He may even end up winning Liverpool the league this season in a more arms-length kind of way. There is no doubt Arsenal would be a more potent team right now if they’d taken a chance and splashed out on a goalscorer.Why didn’t they? Because data says this is a risky move that often doesn’t pay? Hmm. And who is the most persuasive current example of this, living proof that when in doubt it’s better to save your money and go for control? Clue: he’s tall and has a ponytail.This is perhaps a stretch. For now, 12 games from the end, there is surely more to be gained from taking it steady with Núñez, from tickling his neck and just making him feel good.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotcommentShareReuse this content"

Series results have nose-dived, both world titles were surrendered meekly, and the messaging has often been confusing.Matthew Mott paid the price as head coachlast year but not every shortcoming was his.Rohit Sharma hits century as India surge to ODI series victory over EnglandRead moreTo that end, Brendon McCullum’s role expanded to incorporate the white-ball teams this year and his contract was extended to 2027. But while the New Zealander has been able to let the imposing Ben Stokes set the tone of the Test side and serve as facilitator, his brief with Buttler has been one of lightening the load. The first move was to tell him to start enjoying his cricket, before peeling away the wicket-keeping gloves to improve his control of events on the field and reboot his batting.The latter is surely the key, with Buttler’s place in the pantheon of white-ball greats assured but his returns as captain taking a downward turn. In the carbuncle thatwas the 2023 World Cup campaign, he averaged a sorry 15, and while this rises to 33 as permanent captain of the ODI team, only one of his 11 centuries has come in this time. The latest attempt to change his fortunes is to move back down to No 6 in the order, England opting to stick Jamie Smith at first drop and pack the batting.Quick GuideChampions Trophy: South Africa see off AfghanistanShowSouth Africa opener Ryan Rickelton scored his maiden one-day international century with a fluent 103 as his side eased to a 107-run win over Afghanistan in their opening Champions Trophy Group B fixture at Karachi.The Proteas won the toss and elected to bat, amassing 315 for six in their 50 overs on a wicket with pace and bounce that was more akin to their home conditions than a sub-continent pitch. Temba Bavuma scored 58 as he put on 129 with Rickelton [pictured] for the second wicket, with Rassie van der Dussen adding 52 and Aiden Markram ending unbeaten on the same score.Afghanistan's Rahmat Shah scored a fighting 90 but South Africa's seamers stifled the run-rate and picked up regular wickets as their opponents fell well short of their target, bowled out for 208 in 43.3 overs. Shah could not form a reliable partnership as Kagiso Rabada finished with 3-36 in 8.3 overs and was well supported by Wiaan Mulder, who took 2-36 in his nine overs.South Africa will next play Australia in Rawalpindi on Tuesday, while Afghanistan meet England in Lahore on Wednesday in what is already a must-win game, regardless of the outcome between England and Australia on Saturday.ReutersPhotograph: Zoral Naik/REUTERSWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I feel like 50 overs has been my best format over my career,” said Buttler. “It’s where I’ve had the most impact and I want to try and double down on that super-strength of being in the middle order, playing impactful innings and being really true to my own identity as a cricketer. I think that’s really something I’m tapping back into. That’s what I want to get out of this tournament and going forward. Over the rest of my career I want to be true to that and, if I can, I’ll be very content.”While Buttler likely needs positive results for his own job security, such thoughts – much like the Test team under Stokes and McCullum – are being parked. Ben Duckett caused a stir during the recent 3-0 defeat in India when hesaid he did not care about the whitewashif England went on to win the Champions Trophy; a statement that saw its qualifier widely ignored and annoyed a good deal of supporters in the process. For Buttler, having also defended his team’s work ethic in India, it was misunderstood. “Every single player who plays international sport, no matter what sport it is, I can guarantee would not have got there if they weren’t ultra-competitive and didn’t want to win,” said Buttler, clarifying his opener’s remarks.“What people must understand is that people saying you want to win doesn’t guarantee results.“You have to find ways to look after the things that you can control; to work out how to be really present at a tournament like the Champions Trophy. Getting close to what we’re capable of is the thing I want most out of us, and if we’re doing that then the results will come as well.”View image in fullscreenJoe Root’s batting is taken for granted but his bowling will also be required in the Champions Trophy.Photograph: Sameer Ali/Getty ImagesFirst up in a group that features Afghanistan and South Africa are Australia, the first of a derby-themed weekend with India versus Pakistan to follow. Not since 2011 have Australia’s men gone into a global tournament without at least one of Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc at their disposal; a golden opportunity, one would think, and not least on a Lahore surface tipped to be full of runs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a team structure that brought New Zealand success in the recent tri-series in Pakistan, notably, and there is every chance Australia match up similarly. Word is that Glenn Maxwell will bat at No 7, with his off-breaks, plus Travis Head and Matthew Short, expected to make up the shortfall.The great unknown is whether dew will become a factor during the second-innings run chase and make the toss more significant, with England’s one training session under lights having taken place after a day of thunderstorms and so offering few clues. “You’ve got to plan and be prepared,” said Buttler, when asked about this. “But also not have too many preconceived ideas and play the game in front of you.”Quick GuideEngland v Australia: probable teamsShowEngland (confirmed): Phil Salt, Ben Duckett, Jamie Smith (wk), Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jos Buttler (c), Liam Livingstone, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood.Australia (possible):Travis Head, Matt Short, Steve Smith (c), Josh Inglis (wk), Marnus Labuschagne, Alex Carey, Glenn Maxwell, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Adam Zampa, Spencer JohnsonWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It takes place at the Gaddafi ­Stadium, a ground that has undergone extensive work just in time for the tournament and looks mighty impressive for it.

Sarina Wiegman’s Lionesses began their Nations League campaign with a profligate and frustrating 1-1 draw against Portugal in Portimão.“I’m disappointed about the result,” said the England manager, who also took time after the game to express her solidarity with Spain’s players after Luis Rubialeswas convicted of sexual assaultfor kissing Jenni Hermoso after the World Cup final against England. “I stand with the Spanish players and it’s really sad they have this on their path. They are changing society, and they have so much courage to stand for this and themselves and we stand in solidarity with them. We have the Nations League starting tonight, we are talking about this but we should be talking about the Spanish team and how good they are at football.”In a group with the World Cup holders, also the world’s No 2 side, and Belgium and Portugal, ranked 19th and 22nd in the world respectively, England needed a strong start. But Kika Nazareth’s goal to cancel out Alessia Russo’s first-half effort will be a frustrating and potentially dangerous one. Spain, meanwhile, came from two goals down to earn a 3-2 win over Belgium deep into injury time.Portugal v England: Women’s Nations League – liveRead moreWithout Georgia Stanway, Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood, who are all absent with medium- to long-term injuries, and Beth Mead, who withdrew from the squad late on with a calf injury, Wiegman handed starts to two of England’s brightest young talents. The steady integration with the senior regulars of Manchester United’s Grace Clinton and Manchester City’s Jess Park is gathering pace ahead of the Euros, the injuries quickening the necessity.Against Portugal Clinton shone, her relationship with club teammate Ella Toone and Chelsea’s Keira Walsh growing stronger by the minute. The 21-year-old was metronomic in the first half, and showed her value defensively early on when England failed to clear Joana Marchão’s free-kick and the midfielder made a shot-blocking tackle.Portugal have not been easy prey for England. The last meeting between the two teams came in July 2023, as both sides prepared for the World Cup, andended in a stalemate. Preceding that, a scrappy second-half Mead goal salvaged a win for England in Setúbal in October 2019 – towards the end of Phil Neville’s tenure.In Portimão, on the Algarve, it took 10 minutes for England to find their feet but by the 15-minute mark they were ahead and playing with a fluidity that belied the four-month absence of international football. The goal itself was particularly special, Lauren James’s crossfield ball was met by Lucy Bronze at the byline and the full-back, who is half Portuguese and played with both flags printed on her boots, delivered an unexpected and sumptuous cross in for an unmarked Russo to sidefoot in from close range.View image in fullscreenAlessia Russo tucks home the opening goal for England during their draw.Photograph: Rodrigo Antunes/ReutersClearcut chances were few and far between, Francisco Neto’s side a well-organised unit, but England arguably should have had a penalty moments before the break, Clinton furious after being pulled back as she drove through the middle to meet Russo’s header back across goal. “Yes, honest answer,” said Wiegman on whether she felt it was a penalty, before adding that, regardless, England had enough opportunities outside of that chance to get the second goal.Bronze did not return after half-time, a precaution said Wiegman afterwards, but England struggled to stay ticking.Neto credited the shift in momentum in favour of his side to a change in formation to a 4-4-2. “I felt like the result was really fair for us,” he said. “England had problems before Kika came on in the second half, when we changed formation, we started to dominate the game and felt really comfortable.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But she made England pay for their profligacy in the second half, the substitute shrugging off the challenge of England’s young dynamo before curling the ball into the top corner from just inside the box.Late call-up Chloe Kelly and the Chelsea forward Aggie Beever-Jones were thrown into the mix late on, but it was Portugal that would go closest to a winner, the centre-back pairing Millie Bright and Leah Williamson both called upon to make blocks minutes apart as the clock ticked towards full time.England head to Wembley on Wednesday night to play Spain for the first timesince the World Cup final, while Portugal travel to Belgium. Lose to the world champions, and England will heap the pressure on themselves as they head into April’s fixtures, their inability to escape the group stage last season, and failure to qualify for the Olympics as a result, weighing heavy.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Nations LeagueEngland women's football teamPortugal women’s football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Having played a short pass to Josh Cullen, Edwards received the return, benefited from a ricochet off Shea Charles and showed neat footwork before producing a close-range finish.Swansea crave end to crisis after self-inflicted slump and parade of exitsRead moreIt was a cruel way for Danny Röhl’s team to fall behind after they had made light of Burnley’s incredible defensive record this season. The opening 34 league games have seen the Clarets concede just nine goals. Wednesday missed three great chances to end Burnley’s run of 11 games and 1,000 minutes without conceding in the first 19 minutes alone.Michael Ihiekwe produced a shot which clipped the outside of a post, the winger Djeidi Gassama crossed for Stuart Armstrong, who put a six-yard shot wide, before Gassama was again the architect, this time setting up Josh Windass, whose effort flew wide via the defender Maxime Esteve.Wednesday started the second half as they had the first, with Windass and Armstrong both having glorious chances blocked by defenders. As had been the case earlier, Wednesday paid for those misses with Brownhill scoring with his first touch after coming on as a 62nd-minute substitute. Burnley maintained the pressure from a half-cleared corner, with Josh Laurent sending Jaidon Anthony away down the right and his cross being met by Brownhill, who scored from close range.Roberts was somehow unmarked to add a third after 70 minutes, side-footing in from another Anthony cross.

Villa may be grateful for that: had they taken a point from that game they would have been facing Bayern in the last 16. That said, as domestic form has stagnated,the victory over Bayern, a repeat of the scoreline from the 1982 European Cup final, probably represents the high point of their season so far. Domestically this hasn’t been a great campaign for Brugge either. They lie eight points behind Racing Genk but for them too the Champions League has provided salvation. They sneaked into the playoffs with three wins but then were much the better side against Atalanta, winning home and away.Verdict:NarrowAston VillawinLiverpool face PSG as Champions League last-16 draw sets up Madrid derbyRead moreBorussia Dortmund v LilleLille were perhaps the biggest surprise of the league stage, beating Atlético and Real Madrid and hammering Feyenoord as they finished seventh. Canada’s Jonathan David, who scored six times, isclearly a dangerous front manbut a lack of creativity may hold them back; there is a reason why they are fifth in Ligue 1, having scored eight goals fewer than any side above them. This has been a difficult season for Dortmund, who are 11th in the Bundesliga. Nuri Sahin was sacked after four straight defeats following the winter break and, while three wins in seven under Niko Kovac isn’t a startling uptick, the Guinea centre-forward Serhou Guirassy has hit form and that run did include an impressive 3-0 win at Sporting in the playoffs – albeit the Lisbon side are not what they were before the departure of Ruben Amorim.Verdict:NarrowLillewinView image in fullscreenBorussia Dortmund’s Serhou Guirassy has found his scoring touch of late.Photograph: Armando França/APReal Madrid v Atlético MadridReal Madrid lie one point and one position above Atlético in La Liga, and both league meetings this season finished 1-1, so it should be tight – although on all five previous occasions they have met in European competition, Real Madrid have come out on top. Atlético were the form team in Europe until last month’s defeat at Leganés, having won 15 in a row, a run that enabled them to surge back after two early defeats to qualify fifth in the league phase. Even though results have dipped slightly over the past month, they have lost only one of their past 23, as Diego Simeone continues to defy convention. As Kylian Mbappé demonstrated with hishat-trick against Manchester Cityon Wednesday, he is finally beginning to settle at Madrid, but this remains a battle between a team based on discipline and organisation and one reliant on the inspiration of brilliant individuals.Verdict:NarrowReal MadridwinBayern Munich v Bayer LeverkusenThe sidesdrew 1-1 in Munichin September before agoalless draw at the BayArenalast week, a game in which Leverkusen looked much the better side and hit the woodwork twice. Bayern are eight points clear at the top of the Bundesliga but doubts remain about Vincent Kompany, largely because of performances in Europe. They lost to Villa, Barcelona and Feyenoord in the group stage, and squeaked through their playoff against Celtic only with an injury-time winner after a performance in which they looked worryingly slow and mannered. Following last season’s undefeated Bundesliga success was always going to be difficult for Xabi Alonso’s Leverkusen side, but while they have probably drawn too many games, they have lost only once in the league. Group-stage results were a mixed bag: Leverkusen were the only side to beat Inter, but they lost at Atlético and were well beaten at Liverpool. Florian Wirtz’s recent form could be decisive.Verdict:Narrow Leverkusen winPSV v ArsenalDefensively,Arsenalare the best team in the Premier League, and only Inter conceded fewer in the league stage, but they had goalscoring problems even before their front three went down with hamstring injuries. Inter were the only team to beat them in the league stage and they have lost only twice in the Premier League. Given Mikel Arteta’s emphasis on control, two-leg ties may suit them, but set plays and Mikel Merino may not be sufficient sources of goals. Peter Bosz’s side lost to Juventus in the league phase, then lost to them again in the first leg of their playoff, but victory in the second leg took them through after extra time. Second in the Eredivisie, PSV are a typical Bosz side, full of goals and leaky at the back. When the sides met in last season’s group, they drew in Eindhoven but Arsenal were 4-0 winners at the Emirates.Verdict:Comfortable Arsenal winskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most impressive was their defensive record: one goal conceded in those eight games, although they have been less stingy in Serie A. Lautaro Martínez, meanwhile, continues to be a forward who divides opinion, somehow simultaneously prolific and profligate.Feyenoord, fourth in the Eredivisie, sacked Brian Priske last week and are yet to appoint a full-time replacement, though Robin van Persie has been lined up. Their group stage was erratic: they came from 3-0 down to draw at Manchester City, won at Benfica, beat Bayern 3-0 and yet also went down 6-1 at Lille. Most confusingly, their playoff win over Milan, under the interim Pascal Bosschaart, was based on containment. Much will depend on the battle of the Inter wing-backs Denzel Dumfries and Federico Di Marco with Feyenoord’s wide forwards Anis Moussa and Igor Paixão.Verdict:Comfortable Inter winQuick GuideChampions League: last 16 drawShowPSV Eindhoven v ArsenalReal Madrid v AtléticoParis Saint-Germain v LiverpoolClub Brugge v Aston VillaBenfica v BarcelonaBorussia Dortmund v LilleBayern Munich v LeverkusenFeyenoord v InterBracket is in order after home/away fixtures were drawn; so winner of PSV v Arsenal will be at home first in quarter-final against Real or Atlético, and so on.Ties take place on 4/5 & 11/12 March.Quarter finals take place on 8/9 & 15/16 April.Semi finals take place on 29/30 April & 6/7 May.Final: 31 May (Allianz Arena, Munich).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Paris Saint-Germain v LiverpoolTop of the Premier League, Liverpool also topped the Champions League group, but they are not playing as well as they were when they outplayed Real Madrid in November. They have failed to win seven of their past 14 games and, while it’s true that none of their three defeats in that spell were particularly consequential, it’s also true that league form has become scratchier, most notably in the second half of Sunday’sweirdly anxious win over Wolves. Obliterating French sides has rarely been a problem for Paris Saint-Germain, so it was no great surprise when they thrashed Brest 10-0 on aggregate in the playoffs. And while it was a struggle to get there, after one victory from their first five group games, PSG have won their past five Champions League matches, a run that includes the 4-2 demolition of Manchester City. This new celebrity-free PSG may be finding their feet.Verdict:Narrow PSG winBarcelona v BenficaTheir meeting last month produced arguably the match of the league stage asBarcelonawon 5-4, a game that highlighted the attacking strengths and defensive weaknesses of both sides. No team scored more in the league phase, but no side in the top half conceded more than Barcelona, who would have finished top had they beaten rather than drawn with Atalanta on the final day. A run of four wins after four without a win has taken them back to the top of La Liga. Benfica have a similar energy: under Bruno Lage they’re a much breezier side than his Wolves ever were, with goals throughout the side. Even the second leg of their playoff against Monaco, as they protected a 1-0 lead, ended up as a 3-3 nerve-shredder. Ángel Di María, whose capacity to orchestrate breaks remains supreme despite his loss of pace, should be back from hamstring problems to play.Verdict:Narrow Barcelona winExplore more on these topicsChampions LeagueClub BruggeAston VillaBorussia DortmundLilleReal MadridAtlético MadridanalysisShareReuse this content"

Lehecka had stunned Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals in Doha and looked on course to claim another scalp when he won the first set.Draper required a tie-break to get the match back on level terms before he showed his class in the decider to take victory by a 3-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3 score.Both Lehecka and Draper had spent more than two hours on court for their last-eight triumphs, but it did not prevent a high-quality start to their semi-final. A number of powerful blows were mixed in with touches of finesse with one particular Draper drop shot in the sixth game getting the crowd off their feet.Sports quiz of the week: fights, shocks, records, mistakes and a comebackRead moreThe former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was among those in attendance, but it failed to bring any initial luck for London-born Draper as Lehecka struck with his only break point of the first set to move in front.Draper impressively kept his composure and after a nip-and-tuck second set, he upped his play in the tie-break to force a decider. This was Draper’s first tournament since he retired from the Australian Open with a hip issue, but he repeatedly outlasted Lehecka in several rallies to take control of the third set.A first break was swiftly followed by a second as Draper edged out his Czech opponent in two hours and 23 minutes to set up a final clash against fifth seed Andrey Rublev on Saturday. World No 16 Draper has claimed eight victories from nine matches in 2025, with three of them five-set wins at the Australian Open to highlight his improved resilience.“End of last year, I started to pick up some real momentum and was playing good tennis. I was building it and then – all of a sudden – I couldn’t play for about a month,” Draper said, with reference to a recent hip injury.“I went out to Australia and my level was all over the place, but it gave me a lot of confidence coming through those five-set matches. Mentally that was really good for me, even though my tennis wasn’t there. When I came back it was about getting the tennis right, getting my body in the right place and building on that fitness I had done in Melbourne. Coming here, I felt better about my tennis and even better about my body.”Rublev has triumphed in all three of his meetings with Draper and booked his place in the final with a 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (5) win over Félix Auger-Aliassime.The Russian teenage sensation Mirra Andreeva continued her giant-slaying exploits at the DubaiTennisChampionships by upsetting the sixth seed Elena Rybakina 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 in the semi-finals on Friday.View image in fullscreenMirra Andreeva became the youngest player to beat three grand slam winners at a single event since compatriot Maria Sharapova in 2004.Photograph: Christopher Pike/Getty ImagesDenmark’s Clara Tauson set up a final showdown with Andreeva after overcoming Karolina Muchovaha 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-3.Andreeva, who had stunned five-time grand slam champion Iga Swiatek in the quarters and former Wimbledon winner Marketa Vondrousova in the round of 32, is the youngest player to reach a WTA 1000 Final. The 17-year-old French Open semi-finalist also becomes the youngest player to beat three grand slam winners at a single event since her compatriot Maria Sharapova in 2004.Rybakina, ranked seventh in the world, let a slender 2-1 lead slip in a tight opening set as momentum swung back and forth before Andreeva came out on top. However, Rybakina forced a decider after a close second set where she had built a 4-3 lead and just as she looked to run away with the win after racing to a 3-1 lead in the final set, Andreeva roared back to win five successive games. With the victory, world No 14 Andreeva also avenged her 2023 Beijing last-16 defeat by Rybakina.“Last time we played it was a really tough match … she went for her shots and killed me in the end,” Andreeva said. “This time I knew she’d hit hard. I tried to fight for every point and kept believing.”Explore more on these topicsTennisJack DrapernewsShareReuse this content"

He’s the patsy: giving everything away, getting little in returnFri 21 Feb 2025 10.21 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 12.16 ESTShareHe parades as a strongman, but in fact he’s weak, weak, weak. In the face of America’s adversariesDonald Trumpis, as he might put it, a patsy, a sucker, a pushover. He folds like a pack of cards. He’s a human doormat. A loser.Just consider the gifts he has handed Vladimir Putin this week. He has brought Russia in from the diplomatic cold after three years of ostracism following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, whose anniversary is nearly upon us. Sergei Lavrov, Putin’s foreign minister, was meant to be persona non grata; heremains under international sanctions. Nevertheless, this week in Riyadh he met Trump’s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, inso-called peace talks.The mere fact of that meeting gave Putin something he has long desired: parity with the US. It signalled that Washington regards Moscow as its equal: not a pariah state that has committed an unconscionable act of aggression, but a fellow great power, even superpower, to be treated with respect. Whatever was agreed in Saudi Arabia, Putin will chalk that up as a win.But Trump’s generosity did not end there. For who was not in the room in Riyadh? Answer:the Ukrainians. Remember, these were talks to discuss the future of Ukraine. To end a war in Ukraine. After the invasion of Ukraine. The exclusion of Ukrainians from discussions to determine their own future is obviously an enormous concession to Putin: it ensures he ends the war on his terms. But it’s a gift of a deeper kind too. It implicitly endorses Putin’s claim that Ukraine is not a real country, that it was only ever a province of the great Russian motherland with no sovereignty of its own.There were others shut out in Saudi Arabia, and their exclusion was another kindness to the Russian dictator. The nations of Europe were not represented, even though they have a direct stake in what happens on their eastern frontier. They have been allies of Kyiv, aiding in the defence ofUkraine, and therefore their presence was deemed too uncongenial to the Russians. So they were not invited.Again, though, this concession contained another, larger one. For what is one of the great strategic goals of Putin, which explains so much of his activity over recent years, including his meddling in foreign elections? It is the fragmenting of the western alliance. He loved Brexit,cheers on the far right in Europeand backed Trump because he wants to see the crumbling of the western bloc that has stood firm against him. For a US president to follow that script, icing out America’s most longstanding allies, is a huge win for the Kremlin.Not least because it came straight after the US vice-president, JD Vance, had travelled to Munich – a city whose name will for ever be associated with the appeasement of dictators – to berate the democracies of Europe,lecturing them on free speechand culture wars, while making no mention of Russia’s suppression of all dissent, manifested in the unfortunate tendency of Putin’s internal critics to end up dead.All of this would have represented a spectacular set of concessions to Moscow. But there was more. For one thing, Trump’s comically unqualified defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, had earlierwarned Ukrainethat it would never recover the lands stolen from it by Russia and that it should abandon all dreams of joining Nato. Again, two more items on Putin’s wishlist ticked off.But then, Trump posteda social media rantthat echoed a raft of Putin’s favourite talking points. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is “A Dictator without Elections,” Trump wrote, massively unpopular with his own people, ripping off the west as Ukraine corruptly swallows up billions of dollars. To cap it all, he endorsed the Orwellian, black-is-white inversion of truth advanced by the Kremlin when he said:“You should have never started it.”As if it were Ukraine that invaded Russia three years ago, rather than the other way around.That, then, is everything Trump handed to Putin in the last week or so. And what has he got in return? Nothing, save flattery and the dangled promise oflucrative energy dealswith Moscow. Indeed, he did not so much as ask for anything in return. The supposed strongman fell to his knees and kissed the Russian dictator’s feet before they had even entered the negotiating chamber. Small wonder that Kurt Volker, who resigned as Trump’s point man on Ukraine in 2019, told me for thelatest Politics Weekly America podcastthat the president has a “blind spot on Putin,” one Volker admits he does not understand.What are we to make of Trump’s Ukraine policy? | Matt DussRead moreAll of which makes it laughable for Trump to claim he is “successfully negotiating an end to the war”, something only he could do, or for his cheerleaders to hail“the art of the peace deal”, or indeed for the meeting in Riyadh to be described as “peace talks” at all. They are nothing of the kind. If you give one side everything they want, which they naturally accept, while denying the other side everything they need, which they naturally reject, that is not a peace agreement: it is nothing more than a coerced surrender. Anybody could do that. It is no achievement at all.And Trump has form in this area, the supposed master of the deal repeatedly giving away everything and getting nothing in return. Recall hisphoto-op meetingwith Kim Jong-un in 2018. The North Korean tyrant and ruler of a slave state was rewarded with the legitimacy of a summit with – and the effusive praise of – a US president. Kim also won asuspension of US military exercisesin the Korean peninsula. These were concrete, high-value gains. In return, Kim conceded nothing but some vague aspirations for a world without nuclear weapons. He played Trump like a slot machine.To be clear, presidential weakness is not the gravest sin here. More serious is the capitulation to a dictator, the acquiescence in an invasion and the lasting precedent it sets, the abandonment of an ally fighting for its life and an apparent decision to break apart an alliance that has delivered relative peace and prosperity to the west, including the US, for eight decades.Trump’s explainers say he’s doing thisfor a hard-headed reason: to end the distraction of a war that does not affect the US directly, so that it can focus its resources on the real threat, China. But even judged on its own terms, this move is a failure. Because a broken west makes a future dominated by China more, not less, likely.The rest of the west, including Britain, needs to decide very quickly how to navigate the new world that emerged with vivid clarity this week. The postwar era is over. The global architecture built in 1945 is being burned to the ground by Trump. Europeans need to plan for, and invest in, a future where they have to defend themselves without the US. That future does not loom in the distance. It is already here.For now, there is a political job that can be done. It is the puncturing of the image Trump has done so much to cultivate, and which he relies on to intimidate others, at home and abroad. The Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal made a good start this week, when he said:“The president’s surrender is pathetic and weak.”This is the right language to use. Trump may be the greatest showman, but he is the weakest strongman the world has ever seen.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So why isn’t Labour shouting about it?Polly SmytheWhy would the government water down and downplay such a popular policy? Because the business lobby doesn’t like itFri 21 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 12.25 ESTShareAt last year’s TUC conference, the employment rights minister, Justin Madders, described Labour’s workers’ rights package as “the sort of thing that would make you say to the person on the street: ‘It does matter who you vote for.’” Despite the bill’s initial offering havingbeen diluted, he is right: day one employment rights, an end to “exploitative” zero-hours contracts and a clampdown on fire-and-rehire.In the midst of abysmal polling, you would thinkLabour, desperate to prove that after more than a decade of Tory dysfunction the government can improve people’s daily lives, would loudly embrace its overhaul of worker protections. But that is not what has happened. Instead, even as the government has launched a frenzied publicity offensive over its “tough” immigration stance, it has remained comparably silent over its employment reforms, seeming to shyaway from letting news of the bill even reach the person on the street.What is going on? The answer is simple: fevered controversy surrounding Labour’s modest employment reform has the government running scared. Spearheading the alarmism is thebusiness lobby– in a reprisal of its hysteria prior to the introduction of the minimum wage – which is prophesyingjob lossesandcompany closuresas a result of reform. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has been open about“lobbying hard”against the bill. The group’s chair, Rupert Soames, has accused Labour of treating business like a“cash cow”, and insisted that the combination of the new reforms with a raise in the national minimum wage and employers’ national insurance contributions will prompt an“ugly rush”of sackings.Parts of the media have been more than happy to amplify these scare stories. AFinancial Times editorialtitled “Labour needs to compromise on employment rights” claimed that, if the party is to “foster the economic dynamism the UK needs”, it will need to go “much further in adjusting the legislation to meet business concerns.”.Reform UK has voted against the employment rights bill at every stage, with Nigel Farage using hisGB News slotto allege that protecting workers from third-party harassment spelled the end for pub banter.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has also taken aim at the legislation, accusing Keir Starmer of proposing not an employment bill but an “unemployment bill” that would leave the public with “higher prices, fewer jobs and less growth”.That the attacks on the bill, and on Labour’s links with the unions, are so predictable is what makes the government’s vulnerability to them so disappointing. Trade unions – who have fought line by line over the reforms with Labour for years – know full well that the government’s reticence to champion the bill puts it at greater risk of being further derailed.Not one to flinch from a challenge, Mick Lynch, when asked about the CBI’s defence of fire-and-rehire, told theemployment rights committeethere is no doubt that the Factories Act – a Victorian law restricting children labour – was “a bit burdensome for the mill owners and mining companies of this country”.With the bill under siege, robust ripostes like these are needed to protect it. Before it had even reached parliament, key provisions had been walked back. Gone are universal plans for “fair pay agreements”, which would have imposed sectoral collective bargaining across the economy, but will now only be used in the adult social care sector. Also scrapped is the pledge to pay in full the wages of workers on zero-hours contracts who have their shifts cancelled “without appropriate notice”, replaced instead by “compensation that is proportionate”.And with Labour having left much of the hard work of fleshing out the bill to future secondary legislation and consultations, there is growing anxiety among unions over the potential for even further backsliding. Take the question of employment status. With entitlement to many of the new rights unveiled by Labour hinging on the question of worker classification, clarification on the boundary between employment and self-employment is urgently needed to ensure the maximum number of workers benefit.Yet despite an initial commitment to move “towards a single status of worker and transition towards a simpler two-part framework for employment status”, this policy will instead be subject to a “full and detailed consultation”. After years of debate and two backbench bills on the subject, it is hard to know what could be left to consult on. “You can probably consult till the cows come home,”said Margaret Beels, the government’s independent director of labour market enforcement. “It’s about time to do something about it.”Starmer’s aides will not be able to fix his problems. He has to do that himself | Tom BaldwinRead moreWith the employment bill expected to make its way back to the Commons soon, unions are working hard to ensure that the promises Labour made them in opposition are the policies it delivers while in government. Last week, the 11 general secretaries of trade unions affiliated to Labour, including Unite and GMB, called on the government in anopen letterto “stand firm on workers’ rights” and “face down the naysayers”.With Labour so fixated on establishing its economic credibility in the eyes of the corporate world, it has fallen to the TUC to make the point that the new workers’ rights bill supports, and not hinders, the government’s growth strategy. Rather than cede to Reform on immigration, Labour is being pushed by the TUC to use its expansion in workers’ rights as ammunition in the fight against the party,publishing a pollshowing the popularity of the bill among Reform voters.Taking the results of this pollto the streets, the TUC asked Clacton residents who they thought had opposed the employment rights bill. They shot back with “businesspeople, obviously”, “the employer” and “company owners”. When told that it was in fact their MP, Nigel Farage, they reacted with genuine shock. “Nigel? No!” replied one woman. “I am really surprised. Because I thought he was working for the public.”Labour should take this as proof that failing to talk about workers’ rights is not only morally weak, but a strategic miscalculation. Remaining silent on a policy that makes workers’ lives more stable and dignified leaves space for Reform to step in and present itself as the party providing solutions for working people. If Labour caves in further to corporate scaremongering, it will be more than just its relationship with the unions that is at stake.Polly Smythe is labour movement correspondent at Novara MediaExplore more on these topicsWorkers' rightsOpinionLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

With Reform targeting Labour’s working-class support, a reappraisal is overdueFri 21 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 07.26 ESTShareAs one poll this month placed Nigel Farage’sReform UK aheadof Labour and the Conservatives for the first time, I sought distraction on holiday in Jonathan Coe’s latest novel. Set during the brief seven-week premiership of Liz Truss,The Proof of My Innocenceis a Graham Greene-style “entertainment”, rather than another Coe state-of-the-nation book like Middle England or Bournville. But it does deal with a serious political theme: the morphing of British conservatism, from the 1980s onwards, into the radical, insurgent force that culminated in Brexit, Boris Johnson and Kwasi Kwarteng’s budget.Coe writes wonderfully well, and with empathy about very different social worlds. But his overall perspective generally stays within an embattled liberal-left comfort zone. Towards the end of the book, a twentysomething character offers her take on the disruptions that led to our present discontent: “Britain changed. What we had before: consensus more or less. What came after: libertarianism/individualism. Every man and woman for his/herself.” Earlier, the revelation of a secret plot to sell the NHS out to big pharma – involving a high-profile Brexiter – underlines a gradual eclipse of public virtue by private monied interests.Malign and greedy motives cloaked in false patriotism, driving an elite that is bent on misinforming and hoodwinking the less well off and the less well educated. This is one standard progressive explanation for how Britain went off the rails. And as I turned the final pages of The Proof of My Innocence, politics was imitating art in the House of Commons.At a recent prime minister’s questions, Keir Starmer used a planted backbench question tosound the alarmover Reform’s plans to sell out the NHS. Farage’s sympathy for insurance-based healthcare, Labour research suggests, is viewed with deep suspicion in the kinds of seats that Reform hopes to win en masse in 2029. There will be much more of the same before May’s council elections, as Starmer seeks to detach blue-collar voters from a movement that is visibly reassembling the Get Brexit Done coalition of 2019.Fair enough. “When in doubt, campaign on the NHS” is an unwritten law on the British centre-left. Obeying it is an understandable manoeuvre from a government increasingly traumatised by Farage’s rise. But as the wind from the radical right blows ever harder through western democracies, the politics of the moment require more than defensive pieties, buttressed with technocratic talk about policy “delivery”.All over again, Labour is losing its working-class audience. Among non-graduates andyoung men, among the inhabitants of unlevelled-up towns, and among those nostalgic for a lost sense of community cohesion, Farage is making hay. As talk of anelectoral pactbetween Reform and the Conservatives begins on the right, the remain/leave divide in British politics is back.It never really went away – although Covid and its scandals scuppered Johnson’s attempt to seize the moment for the right. A post-industrial cleavage both cultural and economic was never just about the case for and against leaving the European Union. At its most basic, the blue-collar leave vote expressed a desire for rupture with a globalised capitalism that had undermined the power and agency of the western working class. It also reflected a latent perception that compassionate “one world” social liberalism coexisted happily with a callous economic version; one that had stripped people and places of dignity, status and self-esteem.So what now? Following the post-pandemic Tory implosion, the last election represented a historic opportunity for a radical social-democratic response to an ongoing crisis of trust. But whether through naivety, timidity or a hapless lack of curiosity regarding the social class it was founded to represent,Labourtook its handsome victory as evidence of a national desire that normal “grownup” service should resume. Predictably, after six arid months amid plunging poll ratings, it is now planning tougher Reform-style rhetoric on immigration, in the hope of shoring up its position among the Farage-facing.The heart sinks at the lack of ambition and insight. But there is still time to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past in the lead up to 2029. It is, for example, heartening to learn that the much maligned, much misunderstood Blue Labour movement is nowgetting a hearingin Downing Street. Afledgling caucusof sympathetic MPs has also formed in parliament, interestingly including a number from the former Corbynite left.Founded in 2009 by the iconoclastic peer Maurice Glasman, Blue Labour made brief waves as a proto “left-conservative” grouping, focused on protecting blue-collar communities from the depredations of free-market capitalism. It then sank beneath those waves – in a tide of opprobrium – when it emerged that such protections would include restrictions on the import of cheaper migrant labour.Starmer’s dislike of real politics is plain to see. It’s why his government has no direction | John HarrisRead moreSupport for Brexit, and a communitarian emphasis on “family, faith and flag”, further scandalised secular liberal progressives. Glasman and other leading figures were anathematised. Jonathan Rutherford, a former speechwriter for the ex-Labour MP Jon Cruddas, made a list of the insults that came their way. “Weirdos, misogynists, authoritarians, Brexit, thick leave voters, ageing left-behind men, not welcome, fuck off and join the Tories” were at the politer end of the spectrum.Yet in its analysis of the dynamics of western democracies in the early 21st century, Blue Labour got a remarkable amount right. On immigration, the issue that supposedly rendered it beyond the pale, its views will never mesh with those of Labour’s liberal left, but areno longer outlying. The crucial point is that they were always contained within a wider critique of contemporary capitalism, and the contemporary left, that will be key to challenging a Faragian right.Over the past quarter-century, progressive parties became more middle class, more city based and focused more on individual rights than social class. As Blue Labour has argued, they failed to seriously challenge the economic and social consequences of a world constructed to suit the restless, indifferent, profit-seeking interests of financial capital. The result has been a growing division of people and, just as significantly, places into winners and losers – adeepening dividethat individualist rhetoric about equality of opportunity will not bridge.Phyl, Coe’s youthful protagonist in The Proof of My Innocence, was right. Thatcherism did deliver, and morally justify, a selfish “me first” world. But Faragism, as it prosecutes an exclusionary politics of identity and belonging, is as much a response to that legacy as a continuation of it. Faced with a form of rightwing communitarianism that is shaping a dark future, Blue Labour thinking can be part of a successful response. Time for it to come in from the cold.Julian Coman is a Guardian associate editorExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionReform UKKeir StarmerNigel FarageJonathan CoecommentShareReuse this content"

Renewed conflict with Hezbollah is loomingFri 21 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 09.35 ESTShareAs global attention remains focused on the hostage-prisoner swaps between Hamas andIsrael, another ceasefire in the region hangs in the balance.The 14-month war between Israel and Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim militia which has been the most dominant political faction in Lebanon for the past two decades, was paused by a US-brokeredceasefire in late November. The agreement also paved the way to end years of political deadlock in Beirut. Lebanon has formed anew government, and finally has leaders chosen for their promises to carry out reforms, rather than their sectarian affiliations – but the future of the ceasefire deal has left them facing an immediate crisis.The original 60-day ceasefire was intended to give the two sides time to negotiate a longer truce. Under the deal, Israeli was supposed to fully withdraw its troops from parts of southern Lebanon it had invaded in October, whileHezbollahagreed to move its fighters and weapons north of the Litani river, about 16 miles (25 km) from the Israel-Lebanon border. The Israeli and Hezbollah withdrawals would allow the Lebanese army to move into southern Lebanon.As the deadline for Israel to pull out its forces neared, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government said itwould not complywith a full withdrawal and the ceasefire was extended for three weeks until 18 February. That extension has now expired, and while Israel withdrew from a number of Lebanese towns and villages, it is keeping troopsin five strategic locationsacross southern Lebanon that provide vantage points or are located across from communities in northern Israel. While Israeli officials are calling it a “temporary” deployment of troops inside Lebanon, it’s an occupation of Lebanese territory and it could lead to the ceasefire’s collapse.In a speech on Sunday, Hezbollah’s leader, Naim Qassem, warned thatIsrael must completely withdrawits forces by the 18 February deadline. While he stopped short of promising to renew Hezbollah’s attacks, he cautioned: “Everyone knows how an occupation is dealt with.” In fact, Hezbollah was founded in the 1980s – with the help of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards – to fight the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, which followed Israel’s 1982 invasion that was intended to expel the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) from Lebanon. While Israel succeeded in driving out the PLO and other Palestinian factions, the subsequent occupation gave birth to one of Israel’s most formidable enemies: Hezbollah, which fought an 18-year guerilla war that eventually forced Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon in 2000.Hezbollah has been severely weakened by its most recent war with Israel,which assassinated most of the group’s top leadersand destroyed a significant portion of its estimatedarsenal of more than100,000 missiles and rockets. But, as it has done in the past, Israel risks overreaching after its initial victory on the battlefield, especially as the US failed to restrain Netanyahu from prolonging Israel’s war in Gaza and expanding it into Lebanon. Netanyahu’s government has convinced Donald Trump and his administration to allow Israel to keep a “long term” military presence in southern Lebanon, according toIsraeli press reports.If Israel continues to occupy parts ofLebanon, with Trump’s blessing, it would not only risk renewed conflict with Hezbollah, but also deal a death blow to Lebanon’s new leadership.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump at a press conference at the White House on 4 February.Photograph: Alex Brandon/APThe new president, Joseph Aoun, and prime minister, Nawaf Salam, have pledged to prioritise economic reforms, manage reconstruction after the devastating war with Israel and deploy the Lebanese army in areas that had been controlled by Hezbollah. But they will lose most of their momentum to implement reforms unless Israel withdraws its remaining troops from Lebanon and the two countries can negotiate a more permanent truce.A prolonged Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory – even if Israel tries to portray it as a defensive move intended to protect Israeli communities across the border – would cripple Lebanon’s new leaders before they’ve had a chance to tackle the country’s deep economic and social problems, which long predate the recent war.The latest Israel-Hezbollah conflict started a day after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel. The militia’s leaders said it was an effort to support their Palestinian allies and divert Israeli military resources from Gaza. For 11 months, the daily exchange of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border fluctuated, as Hezbollah tried to avoid a wider war it feared losing. By September, Israel dramatically escalated the conflict when it detonatedthousands of pagers and walkie-talkiesused by Hezbollah members, killing dozens and wounding more than 3,000 people. Israel then assassinated the group’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in a massive airstrike on a building complex in Beirut’s southern suburbs.By December, Israeli attacks over 14 months had killedmore than 4,000 peopleand displaced more than 1 million, nearly a quarter of Lebanon’s population. The World Bank estimated that the conflict caused $8.5bn ineconomic losses to Lebanon, including nearly 100,000 housing units that were damaged or fully destroyed.Even before the recent war, Lebanon was suffering from an economic crisis precipitated by the country’s dysfunctional political structure and its corrupt former warlords who took control of the state in the early 1990s at the end of a 15-year civil war. The economic collapse began in the fall of 2019, when banks ran out of dollars to pay their depositors and the Lebanese currency eventually lost more than 98% of its value.The World Bank labelledit as one of the most severe economic collapses worldwide since the mid-19th century.As a majority of Lebanese peoplestruggled to secure food, medicine, fuel and other necessities, the country’s sectarian leaders continued to bicker over control of various ministries and were unable to elect a president or form a cabinet for years. But the political class was finally able to break the deadlock after the ceasefire and Hezbollah’s weakening.The task of rebuilding the economy – and swaths of Lebanon newly devastated by war with Israel – falls to a new Lebanese government that must maintain a perilous truce and keep a powerful neighbour at bay.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor at New York UniversityDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

To put it bluntly, she’s just not very good. Borderline hopeless. She seems to have put in little or no preparation and has made what should be an awkward session for Keir Starmer into one of his most enjoyable moments of the week.Now seniorConservativeshave started to say much the same thing and are openly wondering if they might have elected the wrong leader. Some are even suggesting Kemi may need to be replaced in the not so distant future. This would be unlikely: forcing Badenoch out would be an even worse look for the Tories. But what is really causing them angst is that Kemi doesn’t seem to be improving. We are living in serious times and she gives the impression of being a deeply unserious politician.Today was a case in point. There is a real war going on in Ukraine, and the US and Russia are trying to broker a deal without the Ukrainians. This is a critical moment for the west. And what was Kemi doing? Speaking at the “alt-right” Alliance for Responsible Citizenship conference about how the real danger the west was facing was the culture wars. “I am saying the unsayable,” she said. She was unaware that no one was stopping her saying anything.Everyone at the conferencewas free to say whatever nonsense they wanted.TuesdayDonald Trump built his reputation in real estate and television on being the Master of the Deal. His stated shtick in his 1987 ghost-written book was always to get the best deal for himself and let someone else take the hit. Presumably that’s why his businesses filed for bankruptcy six times. More fool his creditors.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump: ‘I’m telling you, folks. It was Poland that bombed Pearl harbour.’Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/APWhich is why the US president’s latest venture to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia has blindsided every western country. Because at first glance he appeared to have given away all his bargaining chips before he had sat round the table: excluded Ukraine from the first round of talks; surrendered Ukrainian territory unilaterally; declared that no US troops would be put on the ground as peacekeepers. It’s a deal that makes sense only if you reckon Trump’s primary goal is to keep the Russians happy. Vladimir Putin must be delighted with the way things are shaping up: a chance for two dictators to carve up the mineral and land rights of a third country.Up until now,Keir Starmerhas tried to keep The Donald sweet. Going out of his way to find things to praise him for. Like indulging a badly behaved toddler. Well done for recognising Gaza is mainly rubble, Mr President. And then trying to steer him towards a more realistic option. But that boat has now sailed. Trump just takes flattery as his due and has no respect for those who give it. Starmer offering to be a bridge between the EU and the US feels like a doomed project. So it’s time to choose a side, align with the rest of Europe and back Ukraine unequivocally. This is about democratic values and sovereignty. Not a macho power game.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer with a CT scanner: ‘Can it tell if I’m still alive?’Photograph: Darren Staples/ReutersWednesdaySeason three of The White Lotuswas always going to be appointment television. The first episode was something of a slow burn, though that rather added to the pleasure. We all know the formula by now. The opening sequence of a dead body (or bodies) before cutting back to a week earlier and the arrival of several groups of dysfunctional guests. Mostly rich, smug and entitled Americans with an iffy private life. Over the next six weeks, under the safe direction of Mike White, we know we are in for a treat as we watch the dark comedy psychodrama of the characters unravelling in turn until we eventually discover which one ends up dead and why.Though you can’t help feelingThe White Lotuschain is massively unlucky to have had so many violent deaths in the past four years. Or maybe, never having been to an upmarket resort, I’m out of the loop and this sort of thing goes on all the time. When it gets to Season Four, I’d like to volunteer for the writers’ room and suggest that all the guests have only booked The White Lotus because it’s the perfect venue to kill one another. But not everyone is as thrilled with the return of The White Lotus as I. Some have said their enjoyment has been ruined by the new theme tune being inferior to the ones in seasons one and two. To which there is only one response. WTAF?ThursdayAll is well in my football world again. I realise now that my brief falling out of love with the current Spurs side was not born out of despair. Quite the opposite: it came from a place of hope. Despite recognising that the team was totally lacking in confidence, tactically inept and generally useless, a part of me clung on to the belief that maybe, just maybe, this year we might win something.Now that this is to all intents and purposes an impossibility, I feel a sense that normal service has been returned. To play an entire 90 minutes in the second leg of the Carabao Cup – the most important game of the season – without managing a single shot on target was a piece of performance art. As was the fourth-round FA Cup tie against Aston Villa three days later.My friend Matthew spent hours on a coach with his daughter to get to Birmingham, only for Spurs to concede a goal inside a minute thanks to a ridiculous goalkeeping error. These are the moments Tottenham fans live for. All of which made Spurs’ drab 1-0 win over an even worse Manchester United side agreeably pointless. A classic in non-entertainment as there is no prospect of relegation or qualification for Europe. Just 13 more league games of no consequence. I felt I had my Spurs mojo back.FridayIt won’t have come as a surprise to anyone that the UK’s loudest cheerleader for Donald Trump this week has beenBoris Johnson. After all, Boris was the only Briton to make the cut for a seat in the Rotunda at the US president’s inauguration last month. Even Nigel Farage fell unusually silent for a few days after The Donald had declared President Zelenskyy was a dictator whose approval ratings were just 4% and who had denied Ukraine elections. To cap it all, Trump asserted that Ukraine had been the aggressor in the war with Russia.Johnson took to X to argue that Trump did have a point. We just shouldn’t get lost in the weeds of how accurate The Donald had been, as he had never meant anyone to take him seriously. Everyone knew that half of everything Trump said was untrue and we should just focus on the bits that were. You could almost hear Boris pleading for forgiveness for his own inability to tell the truth.There again, Johnson is something of a lost soul these days. He may now have all the money he ever wanted thanks to his gigs on the right-wing lecture circuit, but he has lost the thing that really matters to him: the adoration. There is no clamour for him to come back into frontline politics. People have had enough of him. His autobiography was a financial disaster for his publishers. Now he is just an expensive curiosity.In September, Boris is doing a live event in Edinburgh where front row tickets cost £160. If you are daft enough to want aselfie and an autograph that will set you back another £121. For what? To hear Johnson trot out the same old lies. May I suggest an alternative? Come and hear me instead. I am at Chelmsford theatre on Saturday night and I can guarantee you more truths and more laughs for an eighth of the price.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochDigested weekConservativesConservative leadershipDonald TrumpBoris JohnsonKeir StarmerThe White LotuscommentShareReuse this content"

In the Trumpian era, Europe is on its ownAlexander HurstTrump and JD Vance are clear: the US is no longer an ally, but an antagonist to democratic valuesFri 21 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 05.47 ESTShareIn 1966, after years of friction with the US over whether France should have its own independent nuclear deterrent, the French president, Charles de Gaulle, withdrew his country from Nato’s integrated command (not, however, from the alliance itself – a common misconception) and asked all US forces stationed in France to leave. In response, the US secretary of state, Dean Rusk,asked de Gaulle: “Does that include the dead Americans in military cemeteries as well?”In a single weekend, JD Vance’sdirect attackson European democracy at the Munich Security Conference and hismeeting withfar-right, anti-Europeanpolitical forces in Germany, have given de Gaulle his historic vindication.There are some things that you avoid saying for as long as you can, for fear that just uttering the words will help bring them into being.For as long as Vladimir Putin has been in power, his geopolitical project has been twofold: to break apartNatoand the EU. Sowing doubt and scepticism has been a prime strategy towards that end. But a tipping point has been reached, and clinging to something that no longer exists is more dangerous than naming its disappearance, so here it is.The “west”, in any coherent sense, is over.Constructivist scholars of international relations hold that states’ interests are ultimately products of the systems of meaning that we create with each other. Many long viewed Nato as the pre-eminent example of constructivism in action. After the second world war, the Nato military alliance solved a trust gap by redefining European security as a collective affair. It thereby opened the door for European states to go even deeper in relinquishing some of their sovereignty in pursuit of political union as well.Nato’s core members were also the core of the “west”, not only because they saw the Soviet Union as a threat, but because they had a “we-feeling” with each other. They practised liberal democracy, based on free and fair elections and the subjugation of pure power to the rule of law (not just domestically, but also internationally – even if imperfectly). In short, a values-based community, from which Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Vance and the US far right have self-deported.In 2019, Emmanuel Macron generated a backlash bydeclaring NATO “brain dead,”only for the alliance to have a resurgence of purpose after Putin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In reality, that resurgence has been more like terminal lucidity than resuscitation; Trump’s election was the pull of the plug. Whatever institutions may linger on impotently, or whatever meetings are held with the necessary diplomatic pomp, there is only one substantive and operative question. Does anyone truly believe that Trump would honour an invocation of article 5 of the Nato treaty, under which an attack on one member state is an attack on all?Forget about benign neglect. With threats to conduct economic war or outright invade in order to annex Canada and Greenland, the US is now the primary menace facing its peaceful northern neighbour, and the second largest threat to its erstwhile European allies. The European public understands this:only 22%see the US as an ally.In the same way as Nato cannot – for the moment – functionally exist without the US, its most powerful member, the “west” cannot conceptually exist when the country representing 35% of its roughly 1 billion inhabitants and more than 40% of its economy appears hostile to liberal democratic values under the rule of law, favouring instead a techno-nihilist oligarchyunder competitive authoritarianism.Musk is an acting, unelected monarch,whose minionshave gone into secure government buildings, taken over IT systems and carried out wholesaleinformation erasure. The administration hasended USAidwithout Congress’s approval – a move described as “unconstitutional and illegal” by Democratic lawmakers – thrusting millions into hunger, sickness and despair. Both Trump and Vancehave suggestedthey could ignore court orders, install tens of thousands of loyalists, and wield the state as a weapon against journalists, activists and their political opposition. Apurge of the federal civil serviceis already under way. As a bonus, Trump has alsosigned an executive orderto halt the prosecution of Americans accused of bribing foreign government officials to win business. None of this radical remaking of the US constitutional order is hidden – Trump has,more than once, mentioned serving a third term, despite US presidential term limits. Only last weekend heinvoked the ghost of Napoleonand appeared to declare he was utterly above the law when he posted: “He who saves his country does not violate any laws.”Even if – and the probability of this is dropping fast – the US has free andfairelections in 2028 that remove Trump and the Republicans from power, there is no unbreaking what is now shattered. Not just domestically, but internationally. The US is unpredictable. A future “friendly” administration would be incapable of making any long-term commitments beyond its own stint in power. The sheer economic size of the US makes its current and future chaos untenable for the rest of the world, which must now try to cordon it off as much as possible. Perhaps with100% import tariffs on Teslato start – as Chrystia Freeland, a candidate to become Canada’s next prime minister, has been promoting – and quickly moving on to compensating for the Trump administration’s assault on global climate goals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A ban on X? Long overdue. Dependence on Starlink, SpaceX, or anything else Musk-related? The Trojan horse could not be more obvious even if it were literally written out in the stars.Every bit of soft power that the US relinquishes, Europe should grab with both hands. For example, where USAid has been hobbled, the EU should see a prime opportunity to step in. And while we shouldn’t be under any illusions about China – an authoritarian state with imperialist territorial designs, colonialist economic policies all over the African continent and an atrocious human rights record – unlike the US, it is the only global player with the ability to move at the scale and speed necessary in decarbonising enough emissions for us to still have a chance of limiting global heating to 2C. If there is a chance to strike a climate-focused deal, the EU shouldn’t hesitate to prioritise doing so above the US’s eventual objections.Certainly, Europe must be able to deter aggression entirely on its own – regardless of who the aggressor is. And then it should summon the spirit of de Gaulle and tell the US that its time on the continent is over. As for the dead Americans in military cemeteries? For now, at least, it is in Europe that the values they sacrificed themselves for still endure.Alexander Hurst is a GuardianEuropecolumnistExplore more on these topicsNatoOpinionEuropeUS foreign policyJD VanceEuropean UnionDonald TrumpElon MuskcommentShareReuse this content"

In the United States, Donald Trump had just won a decisive victory and was promising to move fast and break things. With a political storm brewing, was this the right time for the EU’s most important member state to embark on a period of prolonged introspection?Three tumultuous months later, with German democracy itself in thecrosshairsof a hostile Trump administration, Sunday’s poll feels more like a valuable opportunity for an emergency reset. Any federal election carries huge significance beyond Germany’s borders. This poll is distinguished by being the first of a new era – one in which the transatlantic alliance that underpinned Europe’s postwar security can no longer be relied upon. Its outcome will be fundamental to shaping the EU’s response to that new reality, as existential decisions are made overdefence spendingand protecting Ukraine.With the centre-right coalition of the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union comfortablyaheadin the polls, the strong likelihood is that Mr Scholz, a Social Democrat, will be replaced as chancellor by Friedrich Merz. Mr Merz hasemphasisedthe need to stand up to bullying from Mr Trump over Ukraine and potential trade tariffs. Increasingly hawkish on Russia and the need to protect the EU’s eastern flank, he would be likely to take a more expansive approach on the European stage than Mr Scholz, whose inward focusexasperatedthe French president, Emmanuel Macron.Mr Scholz had his reasons for that. However alarming the international outlook, for many voters Germany’s urgent priorities remain narrowly domestic. A spate of fatal attacks involving migrant suspects has been ruthlessly exploited by the far‑right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, driving immigration to the top of the political agenda.All mainstream parties remain committed to the traditionalfirewallexcluding the AfD from power (though Mr Merzreliedon its votes to pass a recent opposition motion on stricter migration rules). But polls suggest it will achieve a comfortable second place on Sunday – a deeply disturbing position of strength for an ethno-nationalist party officially classified as suspected extremist. The party’s growingpopularityamong under-35 voters, and particularly among young men, is ominous.The rise of the far right has been accelerated by prolonged economicstagnation. Post-pandemic, Germany’s business model has been crushed by an end to the era of cheap Russian energy, higher interest rates and falling demand for its exports. Since Covid, almost a quarter of a millionmanufacturing jobshave been lost, in a country that prided itself on being Europe’s industrial powerhouse. A historic reluctance to borrow to invest – constitutionally enshrined in the 2008 debt brake – has become a liability, stymieing Mr Scholz’s attempts to respond.A suddenly isolated Europe needs a confident and prospering Germany at its heart. In a fragmented political landscape, it will almost certainly fall to another broad coalition government, led by Mr Merz, to try to deliver this. The AfD will, meanwhile, position itself as a Trumpian alternative-in-waiting, talked up by the likes ofElon Muskand the US vice‑president, JD Vance. Rarely has it been so important that the politics of moderation and consensus should succeed. In the post‑reunification era, the stakes both inside and outside Germany have never felt higher.Explore more on these topicsGermanyOpinionOlaf ScholzThe far rightAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)EuropeUkraineDonald TrumpeditorialsShareReuse this content"

But there is still much to celebrate about British soap operasFri 21 Feb 2025 13.25 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 21.30 ESTShare“It wasn’t exactly like On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer or turning to page one of War and Peace, but you have to say the BBC did its best to make the start of its new twice-weekly soap EastEnders go with a bang,” opined theGuardian’s TV critic in 1985. It would take a year, the review concluded, to see if the show was a goer. This week EastEnders marked its 40th anniversary.But as with every celebration in Albert Square, a less cheery story is lurking in the background, despite an eventfullive edition, nostalgic documentaries andbest-of lists. The BBC’s one-time ratings giant, commanding 30 million viewers on Christmas Day in 1986, is suffering a midlife crisis. This year’s Christmas show figures were a sobering 4.39 million. It is a similar picture over on ITV, where next year Coronation Street and Emmerdale will revert from one‑hour to30-minute episodes.Reality TV, streaming, budget cuts, “prestige” dramas, changing viewing habits,AI– there are more new players queueing up to kill off British soap operas than there were suspects for the shooting of Phil Mitchell in 2001. Then there are the self‑inflicted wounds: overstretching the number and duration of episodes and sacrificing social realism and strong characterisation to silly storylines. Back when the biggest spectacles on Coronation Street belonged to Deirdre Barlow, the writer Paul Abbott described the thrill of writing atrial script about Jack Duckworth getting a window cleaning round. It wouldn’t make the cut today.Unlike the glitzier, shoulder-padded Dallas and Dynasty in the US, British soaps have always been grittier celebrations of working-class families and life. Corrie came out of the kitchen-sink dramas of the 1950s.EastEnderswas born into the shifting landscape of Thatcherite London. The worlds they portray no longer exist. The idea of a pub as the heart of a community is as dated as a Babycham – the Queen Vic would surely be a gastropub by now.But soaps gave voice to people who didn’t speak with Radio 4 accents, and roles to people rarely seen on our screens, not least older women. Albert Square belongs to a long line of matriarchs with big hearts and even bigger earrings. Fromthe first gay kiss in a British soapon EastEnders in 1989, these shows have also played an important role in tackling taboo issues.Today’s TV shows are as much part of our cultural DNA as Dickens’s novels (often cited as the precursors to soaps): the names Elsie Tanner and Dirty Den as familiar as Miss Havisham or the Artful Dodger. Simon May’s “doof, doof” EastEnders theme tune (voted more recognisable than the national anthem in 2008) has been the soundtrack to countless TV dinners. The plaintive opening notes to Corrie, written to capture the sense of sunshine bursting through clouds, has signalled the end of the day for generations. No matter what disasters occurred in Walford or Weatherfield, they promised comfort and escapism from our own lives. There’s all too little sunshine across the TV schedules these days.While viewing figures will never match those of their heyday, these shows are still loved by millions. The BBC invested£87mon a new set for EastEnders, and plans for an expansion to the Coronation Street set wereannounced in 2022, so they won’t be joining Crossroads, Brookside andNeighbourson the soap scrapheap anytime soon. Will they survive until the next significant birthday?Doof, doof…Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromPaul Goldreich, Russell SimpsonandRobin ShohetFri 21 Feb 2025 12.40 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 12.43 ESTShareZoe Williams argues that fascism’s gradual arrival induces a sense of paralysis (The new world order is exactly what it looks like. Are we too frozen with fear to name it?, 17 February). Her words immediately brought to mind the “smoky room experiment”.In this study, when a person is alone in a room that begins to fill with smoke, three-quarters raise the alarm within minutes. Yet, when surrounded by others who remain passive, only 10% take action. This is the “bystander effect”, identified by Latané and Darley in the 1970s, which reveals how a silent, unresponsive crowd can stifle our instincts – even when our own lives are at stake.I often reference this experiment when discussing climate change, urging people to voice their fears to friends and colleagues. The same principle applies when fascism begins to creep in around us. Trusting your instincts, naming the threat and sharing your fears isn’t just cathartic – it’s empowering. It might even save your life.Dr Caroline VincentLondonZoe Williams is so right. I worked as a psychotherapist at theHolocaustSurvivors’ Centre in Hendon from 1990 to 2000. For 10 years I listened to my clients talking about their experiences of a world that turned from normal to nightmare in a matter of months. They survived Auschwitz and other death camps while their families were murdered by the Nazi death process. This kind of work leaves one with a very clear and specific understanding of fascism and nazism.When we watched Donald Trump’s inauguration, and witnessed Elon Musk parading Hitler-like around the stage before throwing his arm into the air in that familiar salute, I was dumbstruck for a brief moment. I thought, wait a minute, has he just made a Nazi salute? I had to rewatch three times before my brain would allow me to fully recognise it for what it was.This was the moment I knew the Trump train had lurched into a new order. Zoe Williams is right. We can’t stand by and watch, incredulous. We need to say loudly what this is.Paul GoldreichEastbourne, East SussexI was thrilled to see Zoe Williams mention the little-known book by Charlotte Beradt – The Third Reich of Dreams – to help us understand why we might be so passive in resisting dictators. I came across the book in the early 80s and had it republished in 1986. It is being re-republished in April. The author collected dreams from ordinary people in Nazi Germany between 1933 and 1939. What makes the book so relevant is that the dreams show how we might consciously despise a totalitarian regime, but there is a part of us that wants to belong and be accepted, which explains a passivity, or even collusion.So, for example, a dream is related in which the dreamer sees people from his balcony goose-stepping and thinks how ridiculous and then finds himself joining them and noticing how good that felt. Or a Jewish doctor saves Hitler’s life and feels pleased he is being acknowledged. In our unconscious we might be more complicit in allowing the likes of Trump than we realise. Beradt found that the only people who did not have such ambivalent dreams were those who were active in opposing the regime. Perhaps we can all take note.Robin ShohetLondonTo let Zoe Williams’ insightful analogy unspool a little further, the problem with being frozen in paralysis is that we are ready prey, delicate statues quickly shattered with the flick of a finger. We must resist what is quickly becoming a mass palsy, a kind of hypnotic awe at the audacity of it all. We must admit the infection of fascism in our communal organism so that we can cauterise it together. Start with your own sphere of influence, no matter its reach: your friends and your family, for example. Call it fascism, out loud, then encourage yourself and those you love to act in opposition, with decency and intersectional compassion.Russell SimpsonHelen’s Bay, County DownDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

There was the palliative care nurse at our front door waiting to be let in, standing by our small red car. My husband had terminal cancer and this amazing nurse was incredibly supportive to all of us. The car was his little runaround while he was still able to drive. The picture must have been taken in 2017, not long before he died. An innocuous picture for those filming, but full of heft for my family.Susan DenningStroud, GloucestershireAdrian Chiles’s comments about seeing a picture of his dad onGoogleMaps chimes with my own experience. My first wife died 10 years ago this week. Four or five years afterwards, while searching the area where we used to live, I came across a picture of Sue, about to cross our old road. Like Adrian, my first reaction was shock, followed by surprise and then by a smile. His article prompted me to check to see if she’s still there – she is.Ian HortonLlanbradach, CaerphillyMy own dad died, unexpectedly, just last November. I understand Adrian’s mixed emotions on being confronted with his own father on Street View; I’d give anything to see mine like that, alive and just going about his day – as though I could just pop round for a cuppa. My maternal uncle can still similarly be seen, standing at the window of his home, watching the camera doing its thing. He died four years ago, but I can still drop in online to say “hi” occasionally.Liz NorthGuiseley, West YorkshireOur dad, John, passed away four months ago, but if we visit the family home on Street View, through the living room window, we can still see the top of his head, as he sits in a favourite chair, probably reading the Guardian.Phil GyfordAbbey Dore, HerefordshireMyself and my wife, with our beautiful dog Fred, were lucky enough to be photographed by Google Maps’ cameras while cycling near our house in France in 2014. It brings a tear to my eye looking at how free and fit we all were then. My beautiful wife, Joyce, was diagnosed with a horrible blood cancer in 2018 after falling while running in our forest and rupturing her spleen. The hospital in Mont-de-Marsan was fantastic and fixed her up so quickly. She is now under Christie’s in Manchester. Our gorgeous Fred died three years ago.Stephen GibbonNantyr, DenbighshireReading Adrian Chiles telling of how he was sent a screen shot from Street View featuring his late father reminded me that a few years ago, when Street View was in its infancy, our daughter and some of her friends were similarly caught, but this time bunking off school.Tony FletcherBryncoch, NeathExplore more on these topicsGoogle Street ViewGoogleMapping technologiesFamilylettersShareReuse this content"

A widespread funding freeze for federally backed scientific work also has been imposed, throwing the US scientific community into chaos.Critics say Trump’s executive orders to reshape the NIH ‘will kill’ AmericansRead moreResearchers said work mentioning climate is being particularly targeted. One environmental scientist working in the western US who did not want to be named said their previously awarded grant from the Department of Transportation for climate-adaption research had been withdrawn, until they retitled it to remove the word “climate”.“I still have the grant because I changed the title,” the scientist said. “I was told that I needed to do so before the title of the grant was published on the US DoT [Department of Transportation] website in order to keep it. The explanation was that the priorities of the current administration don’t include climate change and other topics considered ‘woke’.”The researcher said they were “shocked because the grant was already awarded and I would have risked losing it. I’m very concerned about science being politically influenced. If researchers can’t use certain words, it’s likely that some science will be biased.”References to climate are being scrubbed elsewhere, too. Course materials at the National Disaster Preparedness Training Center at the University of Hawaii will delete mentions of “climate change”, leaked emails seen by the Guardian show. The alterations, at the behest of the Trump administration, affect about a dozen different course materials.“Specifically, references to ‘climate change’ and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) have been removed or revised to align with the new priorities,” an administrator at the center wrote. “Please exercise caution when referencing these topics during instruction.”The administration’s animus towards climate research has even extended overseas via the US’s Fulbright exchange program, which offers about 8,000 grants a year to American and foreign teachers and scholars.Kaarle Hämeri, chancellor of the University of Helsinki in Finland, said the descriptions for Fulbright grants had been changed to remove or alter the words “climate change”, as well as “equitable society”, “inclusive societies” and “women in society”.Hämeri said that one grant to his university had already been withdrawn as a result of changes he said were also being imposed across other countries involved in the Fulbright program. Fulbright and the US state department were asked about the extent of the wording bans.“I understand that these actions are due to changed priorities in US government,” said Hämeri. “It will harm research in several important fields, especially as in many cases the US researchers are among the best in their field.”At the National Science Foundation (NSF), a $9bn federal agency that supports research in science and engineering, teams have been combing through active projectslookingfor dozens of words, including “women”, “biased” and “equality” that may violate Trump’s ban on certain grants.The NSF, which has justfiredabout 10% of its workforce, did not respond to questions over whether climate is also on the banned list. Regardless, grants supporting an array of scientific work have been frozen amid this zealous mission to install a newspeak among scientists, despite a court order demanding the freeze be reversed.“[The] NSF is working expeditiously to conduct a comprehensive review of our projects, programs and activities to be compliant with the existing executive orders,” a foundation spokesperson said.The freeze on grants has upended scientific work across federal agencies, hospitals and universities, placing the future of hundreds of millions of dollars’ of research into question.“The people most vulnerable in our society in terms of health and public safety are now even further at risk,” said Jennifer Jones, director of the center for science and democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.“This administration doesn’t have a plan to advance science, they have a plan to remove obstacles for the oil and gas industry. They want to return to an era where kids have polio, rivers are on fire and cities are blanketed by pollution.”Jones said that the US government may be moving in the direction of Florida, where Republicansbannedmention of climate change in state laws. “I live in a state where we are under threat more than ever from climate change but state employees can’t mention it,” she said. “This administration wants scientists to feel threatened. We’ve seen this before but Trump is doing it at an unprecedented scale now.”The attack upon science “feels very personal right now” and may deter a new generation of young scientists from entering their areas of research, according to Joanne Carney, chief government affairs officer at the American Association for the Advancement of Science.“We could see a reduction in whole fields of scientific research that will slow down our ability to understand the natural world and craft policies to protect society and national security,” Carney said.“We’re concerned about the signal this is sending out to any young student interest in Stem [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] who might not think they can see a future in the US,” she said. “We need greater investment in science and technology to be a global leader at this moment. Our adversaries will be very happy with this.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The seventh carbon budget, which will be published on Wednesday, is the latest in a series stretching back to 2008.The timeframe for this advice goes far beyond the usual political horizon: the budget will set carbon levels from 2038 to 2042. But the Climate Change Committee, the statutory adviser under the Climate Change Act, isexpected to warn that the UK is already falling badly behind.Although the CCC cannot prescribe policy, it can make recommendations and set out the limits within which the government can act – for instance, if airports are expanded and people take more flights, there will need to be much deeper cuts to carbon elsewhere in the economy.For that reason, the advice is likely to make uncomfortable reading for senior ministers. Green campaigners and businesses have grown increasingly alarmed at the rhetoric from sections of the cabinet, which has sometimesseemed to pit economic growth against environmental aims.Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, warned of a “growth at all costs, growth is king narrative” that was painting climate and nature concerns as a hindrance.Some recent decisions – togreenlight a new runway at Heathrow, and to continuesubsidising the tree-burning power station Drax, albeit at a lower rate than before – have been protested against. Far worse has been the rhetoric: Rachel Reeves, the chancellor the exchequer, alarmed many when she said planning reforms would let developers “focus on getting things built and stop worrying over the bats and the newts”.View image in fullscreenA recent decision to continue subsiding the tree-burning Drax power station cast doubt on Labour’s green credentials.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverTheeconomic arguments for climate action are clear and well-established. Mike Childs, the head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said: “The cost to the global economy [of failing to control temperature rises] could reach $38tn a year, according to research published in 2024. In the UK, about 6.3 million households are currently at risk of flooding, which could rise to around 8 million by 2050, according to the Environment Agency. It is not just economically prudent to invest in reducing carbon emissions – it would be extreme economic folly not to do so.”Several other big decisions are still in play, includingregulations on housebuilders to make new-build homes low-carbon, and areview of nature and farming regulation. But most divisive of all is likely to be the decision over new oil and gas fields in the North Sea, many of which – includingone of the biggest, Rosebank– are already in the licensing system. As Labour’s manifesto commitment was to award no new licences without revoking current ones, some in government are arguing for Rosebank to go ahead.Pitting green as the antithesis to growth also risks alienating business, says Rachel Solomon Williams, the executive director at the Aldersgate Group of companies that push for a green economy. “To create a strong and resilient economy we need to be taking the lead in the low-carbon sectors that will drive sustainable growth in the future,” she said. “Businesses across the country want to see a regulatory and policy landscape that rewards ambition and innovation in the private sector, rather than a race to the bottom.”With the UKwell off track to meet its current carbon budgets, more action will be needed in theshort and longer term, in every sector of the economy, involving changes to nearly every aspect of our lives from how we live at home to how we get around, what we work on and what we eat.Ministers must set the seventh carbon budget by the end of June 2026. They are likely to accept the recommended overall carbon target, but the detailed policy advice will be up for grabs. A spokesperson for the Department ofEnergySecurity and Net Zero said: “We are committed to meeting our ambitious targets. Britain is back in the business of climate leadership because the only way to protect current and future generations is by becoming a clean energy superpower and leading global climate action.”EnergyIf the government meets its target ofdecarbonising the electricity system almost completely by 2030– a very large “if” – that will not be the end of the story. Electricity supply must roughly double to meet future demand. Ed Matthew, the director of the UK programme at the E3G thinktank, said: “The power system is key because both heating and transport and about two-thirds of industry will need to be electrified. The 2030 target is really just the start of the electrification journey.”Grid upgrades will be needed, along with more focus on demand management, and storage will be key. E3G is calling for more investment in hydrogen, which can be stored in solid or liquid form for producing energy on demand.HomesHome heating makes up roughly 18% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, largely from using gas. By the 2040s, most homes will need to be usingheat pumps, but their takeup has so far beenstubbornly slow. Last summer, only about 250,000 homes were using heat pumps.They are more expensive to install than gas boilers and are still not as cheap to run as they should be, because the way the UK’s electricity market works makes electricity much dearer compared with gas. There are even question marks over whether new homes will be built with heat pumps under forthcoming building regulations called the “future homes standard”.View image in fullscreenBy the 2040s, most homes will need to be using heat pumps, but the take-up so far has been stubbornly low.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PAEd Miliband, the energy and net zero secretary, sounded lukewarm on the technology recently when hetold a select committee: “I am very wary of saying that we will stop people having gas boilers at a point when we cannot guarantee that heat pumps will be cheaper for people.”Yet there are no real alternatives to mass heat pump installations if the UK is to be weaned off gas. The CCC is expected to make this point forcefully.IndustryGiving up fossil fuels in industry will require far more electrification and investment in new technologies, such aselectric arc furnaces for steel-making; hydrogen for use in chemicals, plastics and fertilisers; andlow-carbon versions of cement. For some industries, the only option will be carbon capture and storage, to which the government will devote more than £20bn in the next two decades.All of this will require investment, but few private sector companies are taking the steps needed. Some are likely to be waiting to see what help the government might offer; others may be in engaged in a game of chicken, trying to bully ministers into watering down the UK’s net zero commitments.Williams, of the Aldersgate Group, said: “By making clear that it’s firmly committed to rapid decarbonisation, the government will provide much-needed economic certainty that will ultimately drive investment and generate prosperity.”TransportFrom 2035, it will beimpossible to buy a new petrol or diesel car. Most of the UK’s 30m-strong fleet is likely still be reliant on fossil fuels for some years after, however. Electric vehicles are also no panacea: they stillproduce significant air pollutionand arebecoming heavier along with conventional cars.If decarbonisation targets are to be met, people will need to use public transport far more in future. This should also stimulate economic growth – according to the National Infrastructure Commission, the UK lags badly behind other European countries in the availability of public transport in many of its major regional cities, and this is amajor brake on productivity.Although the government has begun to take the railways back into public ownership, returned bus services to regulatory oversight and backed an Oxford-Cambridge corridor, there is little sign of the joined-up national public transport strategy and investment in local networks such as trams that experts say is needed.FarmingHooting tractors jamming Whitehall in protest at theremoval of inheritance tax breakshave set the tone for this government’s relationship with farmers. Yet farmers are vital to any net zero strategy, to grow more trees, preserve and re-wet peatlands, and reduce the increasing share of emissions from agriculture – which has already overtaken electricity and will be the biggest source of greenhouse gases in just over a decade, according to analysis from the Energy Climate Intelligence Unit.Methane, a powerful greenhouse gas of which animal manure is a leading source,must be tackled as a matter of urgencyif the world is to avoid the worst ravages of climate breakdown.View image in fullscreenFarmers, who have been protesting against the removal of inheritance tax breaks, are vital to any net zero strategy.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAAction is also in farmers’ own interests, according to Tom Lancaster, an analyst at the ECIU. “Farming is the sector perhaps most exposed to the risks of climate change. We’ve just seen one of the worst harvests in decades in the UK, as farmers battled through the wettest 18 months on record and relentless winter rainfall, made worse by climate change,” he said. “We will only see more terrible harvests and flooded and drought-stricken farms in the future if we don’t do more now to move faster towards net zero.”Behavioural changeThe last government refused to countenance any message thatpeople would have to adapt their behaviourin order to bring down carbon emissions. But all the analysis from the CCC so far shows that, without changing consumption, it will not be possible to create the low-carbon society needed. This need not be drastic, and it would be good for us: walking more, cycling where possible, taking public transport instead of the car, and eating less meat would all improve most people’s health.Getting across that message will face deep-seated obstacles, however, including accusations of nanny state-ism – andKeir Starmer’s claim that carbon targets can be reached “without telling people how to live their lives”. Childs, at Friends of the Earth, said proving the benefits was key: “The policy pathway for meeting our carbon budget must not only be robust enough to achieve them – it must also make people’s lives tangibly better, if the mandate for change is to remain strong.”Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsGreenhouse gas emissionsGreen economyClimate crisisClimate Change CommitteeLabourHeat pumpsexplainersShareReuse this content"

She said: “She was everything I aspired to be. She was confident, creative and always her authentic self. She has the most positive outlook on life. I’m older but she was wiser than me. She had a goal, she had prospects, she always knew what she wanted.”She said it had been hard to speak out but felt she wanted to do so for her sister. “I’ve not accepted that this is my reality and it hurts to talk about it but, if it was on the other foot and it was Jaysley sitting here, she’d do me proud.”Emilli said her sister would be glad her story was being told. “I think Jaysley would be proud that her struggles have not gone unheard. I think shining a light on her story will hopefully encourage people to speak up.”Jaysley took her own life afterserious errorswere made in the way the army investigated an alleged sexual assault on her by Battery Sgt Maj Michael Webber. Webber was dealt with by “a minor administrative action” and wrote Jaysley a letter of apology rather than being reported to the police.The inquest in Salisbury heard that the way the complaint was handled made her reluctant to report her line manager, Bdr Ryan Mason, when he launched an “onslaught” of “inappropriate messages” against her later that year.Nicholas Rheinberg, the assistant coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon,strongly criticised“systemic” flaws in the way the army had investigated the alleged sexual assault.View image in fullscreenJaysley Beck joined the army after recruiters attended her school in CumbriaPhotograph: family handout/PAEmilli said: “They cover their own backs, they’ve got their own interests at heart. Jaysley’s complaint against Webber was manipulated as it went up the chain of command to make it sound less severe than the truth, and it makes me feel sick. It took Jaysley a lot of courage to speak up.”She said the alleged assault should have been reported to the police. “It needed to be handled by the police. That could have ultimately left us with Jaysley still here today. I think for that, they’ve got blood on their hands.”The inquest heard that Capt James Hook, who organised the exercise that was running when Jaysley was allegedly assaulted, suspected she might have been trying to “generate a situation”.Emilli said: “He never believed it. He just thought she wanted to get off of the trip. If he had listened to Jaysley, we could have been in a completely different place than we are today.”Jaysley joined the army after recruiters attended her school in Cumbria. Emilli said: “She just thought: ‘I could definitely do this.’”Asked what she would say to young women thinking of doing the same as her sister and signing up, Emilli said: “I wouldn’t advise it, going through what we have gone through and learning how these allegations are swept under the carpet.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Emilli said: “I think people don’t speak up because they think they’re not going to be believed.”Emilli talked to Jaysley the day before she died in December 2021. “We spoke to her every day, without fail.” When her family didn’t hear from her on 15 December, they knew something was wrong. “We left it a little while because they’d been out partying. We just thought it’s so strange.“I said to Mum: ‘I’m just going to try and contact some of her friends and see if they’ve heard from her.’ It just didn’t sit right and I was getting more and more worried. And it wasn’t until we contacted her friends that we learned of her passing.”Emilli criticised the army for appearing to suggest in its own report on Jaysley’s death that “family issues” may have played part. They are a close, happy family. “I think it’s another prime example of the army trying to deflect some of the blame away.”Emilli recalled a time she visited Jaysley at Larkhill camp in Wiltshire. “We ordered a Wagamama, went for a walk. At any given moment that we possibly could, we did everything together. We truly were best friends and always will be – just because she’s gone that doesn’t change anything.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Those could include Cologne, Frankfurt, Geneva and Zurich. Getlink has previously said it wanted new services to beup and running by 2029.Eurostar is the only company that has carried foot passengers across the Channel during the 30 years of the tunnel’s operations, although Getlink’s Le Shuttle also takes cars with drivers and passengers. However, Eurostar has facedcriticism over high prices, and it has ditched international services from Ashford and Ebbsfleet in Kent.The Eurostar network runs from London to Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam, as well as to Bourg-Saint-Maurice in the French Alps during the ski season. It is a far cry from theinitial promisesof a network stretching as far as Manchester and Edinburgh.Train companies believe there could be increased interest in European destinations from travellers keen to avoid the large carbon emissions produced by air travel.Several companies have emerged as possible competitors to Eurostar, including the billionaire Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, theSpanish rail company Evolynand the Dutch startup Heuro.However, St Pancras would require significant changes to cope with more passengers, as it alreadystruggles during peak timeswith security and border checks for thousands of people who are then crowded into waiting areas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whether it’s in our NHS, our economy, or our schools the SNP is taking Scotland in the wrong direction.”Sarwar promised that Scottish Labour would reverse the SNP’s longstanding ban on new nuclear power stations to support new jobs and secure baseload energy as part of its pursuit of clean energy.He claimed Labour would also end rough sleeping, which had cost 242 lives last year, by ensuring there was enough emergency hostel spaces. Labour sources said they would draw on experience in Manchester, where the council focused on helping persistent rough sleepers.Labour would also ban mobile phones in classrooms, without breaching health or disability equalities rights, because of the scourge of cyber-bullying and mobile phone-fuelled violence in playgrounds, he said.On health policy, he said family doctors would be required to see all patients within 48 hours, with people able to use apps to book appointments, after a rewriting of the GP contract.Most of Scotland’s 50 health boards would be merged, and Scottish ministers would make greater use of English hospitals and private providers to cut waiting lists – a reform close to NHS policy in England and Wales. “Under our plans, the money will follow the patient,” he said.A recent decision by the Scottish governmentto reinstate peak fares on domestic rail serviceswould be reversed, while Labour would also reform local government by allowing regions to elect mayors on the English model.He said John Swinney’s SNP government “have had their chance”.“If they were going to fix the problems, they would have done it by now,” Sarwar said. “The fact is every institution is weaker after 18 years of the SNP in government and they have squandered the opportunity Scotland gave them.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandAnas SarwarnewsShareReuse this content"

The materials were corrected, and we closed the matter with no further action based on all the evidence we had at the time.“However, we’ve now become aware of further information, so we will look at this.”The spokesperson would not say why the regulator had changed its position since Wednesday.The decision came after Robert Jenrick wrote to the SRA demanding a new inquiry. The shadow justice secretary earlier this week accused Reynolds of “criminal conduct” and called on the prime minister, Keir Starmer, to sack him.ALabourspokesperson said: “Jonathan looks forward to engaging fully with the Solicitors Regulation Authority and drawing a line under the matter.”Reynolds trained as a solicitor but left before finishing his training contract to run for parliament in 2010.In recent days he has come under pressure to explain why he referred to himself as a solicitor, not only on his LinkedIn page but also on a previous version of his website and in the Commons. He told MPs in 2014 he had “worked as a solicitor in Manchester city centre”.Diana Johnson, a Home Office minister, said this week that the errors on Reynolds’ LinkedIn profile had been “mistakes made by administrative staff”. Neither Labour nor Reynolds have commented on why he referred to himself as a solicitor in the Commons.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has also had tocorrect her LinkedIn profileafter it said she had been an economist at the bank HBOS when she actually worked in retail banking.

The paper is similar but not identical to proposals being discussed by Arab foreign ministers in Riyadh, which has a strong international component and would prevent Hamas ruling in Gaza.But Starmer’s team also intend to raise the Chagos deal in which the UK pays theMauritiusgovernment for a 99-year lease on the islands, a series of atolls in the Indian Ocean that have been described as Britain’s last African colony.Why giving up the Chagos Islands could cost Britain £9bn – podcastRead moreThey will emphasise the deal was a decision based on a security assessment and not by a desire to adhere to the principles of international law, a concept that does not impress the Trump administration.Ministers havefaced criticism over the agreementto hand control of the islands to Mauritius, although it will remain under UK control for almost a century under the deal.An interim deal was agreed last year, building on work that began under the Conservative government, but after Navin Ramgoolam was re-elected as the Mauritian prime minister in November, he demanded torenegotiate the proposals.A steady stream of UK Conservatives has since been trying to persuade the Trump team to reject the deal, embarrassing the Starmer administration. The interim deal negotiated between the Labour government and the previous Mauritian administration last year was endorsed by the outgoing Biden administration.The UK recognises that the new Trump team has the right to review the deal’s implications for its base at Diego Garcia, but hope that the Pentagon officials who cleared the deal under Biden will maintain their previous support in their advice to the new defence secretary, Peter Hegseth.The UK is expecting a US decision in weeks not months, and if Trump vetoed the sale the UK would have little option but to pull out of the draft agreement with Mauritius.The UK argues that even though an international court of justice opinion in 2019 stating the islands belonged to Mauritius was advisory, it would at some stage become binding, and that would have implications for law of the sea rulings, as well as the provision of services on the island by third parties.The UK is arguing a deal struck now that the UK government is confident will last the next 100 years is seen as a better way of taking the US lease on the base out of difficult geopolitics.If no deal was struck, the UK argues the Chinese could use the legally disputed status of the islands to start building listening posts or bases on the outer islands, creating a contested security environment in the Indian Ocean analogous to the current tensions in the SouthChinaSea.Downing Street said: “The legal and security advice is very clear that the operation of the base will be at risk if there is not a deal.”The UK and Mauritius have refused so far to detail the precise cost to the British taxpayer of leasing the islands, but insist a cited £18bn figure is wrong. The deal is front loaded and parts of it are inflation indexed.The US built a military base on the strategic islands after the expulsion of the native Chagossians in the 1960s and 1970s. UK officials claim links between the Mauritian government and China are a myth, and that India is the influential regional power with Mauritius, one of the few countries in the region that has refused to take part in China’s belt and road initiative.Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsKeir StarmerDonald TrumpMauritiusForeign policyChinaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s very rarely questioned. Society accepts that it has a role in protecting people who are vulnerable and at risk. We look after our friends when they’re in crisis. We sit up all night with them. We look out for strangers on a bridge.“My concern is that if we decide as a society, if we concede the principle that people who want to take their own lives should be helped through that crisis and out the other side, then conceding that ground is a huge step.”Appleby said if the bill passed MPs should consider introducing a cooling-off period, as is the case in some other jurisdictions, once an assisted death has been requested.He said he had been deeply moved by some of the stories of terminally ill people who wanted the right to an assisted death, but he argued this would open up the possibility of a validated suicide.“I’m worried once you say some suicides are acceptable, some self-inflicted deaths are understandable and we actually provide the means to facilitate the self-inflicted death,” he said. “That seems to me to be so far removed from what we currently do and from the principle that’s always guided us on despairing individuals, that it’s an enormous change with far-reaching implications.”“It does mean that you start saying certain kinds of suffering are so terrible and so irremediable that we have to support people in this action to take their lives – which in every other sense we would try to prevent.”The private members’ bill, which is sponsored by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater and is in the scrutiny stage where a committee of MPs is considering amendments, would restrict assisted dying to terminally ill people with fewer than six months to live.Appleby said it was important for MPs to consider the moment at which a terminally ill person might decide to proceed with an assisted death, citing his own analysis on when a terminally ill patient would feel the most suicidal.“It starts with the shock of diagnosis and that sense of ‘my life’s already over’,” he said. “But if you can get people through that period … that initial reaction seems to level out. Getting through that first period of shock and despair is something that’s possible. We have to be prepared to try to support the people who can get through that initial despair and get into a period of life which is acceptable to them.“You have a number of potentially remediable risk factors like isolation, for example. Do something about isolation. Depression, treat depression. It should be the offer of supporting people through the remediable elements of a sense of despair.”MPs will consider further amendments next week when parliament returns, including on whether to replace scrutiny of each case by a high court judge with a panel of experts who would have greater understanding of domestic violence and mental capacity.Leadbeater proposed the changes last week and caused a backlash among some MPs who said it was a potential watering down of safeguards. Proponents of the bill say it makes the system more secure by giving each case scrutiny from a senior legal figure, a psychiatrist and a social worker.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Under UK GDPR rules, platforms are obliged to not keep personal data for longer than necessary.However, the parents were surprised that their children’s data would be deleted so quickly.View image in fullscreenIsaac and Lisa Kenevan. Lisa said she thought it was ‘a complete lie’ that TikTok had deleted her son’s data.“The first reaction is it’s a complete lie,” said Lisa Kenevan, whose son Isaac died aged 13.Liam Walsh expressed scepticism that TikTok would have deleted data for his daughter, Maia, who died aged 14, given that, unlike the other three children, her inquest remains open.Ellen Roome is campaigning in parliament for the introduction of a “Jools’ law”, in tribute to her 12-year-old son Julian, which would give parents the automatic right to their children’s data after their deaths.“If there was a paper diary in their [children’s] bedroom, I guarantee you every single parent would have read that diary to see if they could understand. What’s happened now is that has moved online and for kids social media is the equivalent of a diary. So why are we not looking at their online diary to see if it can give us some sort of answer?” she said.View image in fullscreenArchie Battersbee with his mother, Hollie Dance. Dance should be able to access Archie’s data because he was under 13 when he died, but she has still struggled to obtain it.Photograph: HandoutHollie Dance said that because her son, Archie Battersbee, was 12 when he died she had the automatic right to his data, because GDPR rules apply only from the age of 13, yet has still struggled to obtain it. “There’s still three [of his] accounts that are up. I can see them for myself,” she said.According to TikTok, searches for videos or hashtags related to the challenge have been blocked since 2020. The platform says it prohibits dangerous content or challenges and aims to remove them before they are reported and direct those who search for hashtags or videos to its safety centre.Dance said she had screenshots of dangerous challenges that she had been able to find easily.The parents said they wished they had never allowed their children to access social media, and they did not realise how limited their rights to access their children’s data were.“We’re basically handing our children a hand grenade,” said Kenevan. “Achild’s brain is not fully developed until around 25. The amount of content they are bombarded with, it’s not healthy for them. A lot of them have seen such harmful content. They’ve seen pornography at the age of, like, 10 and 11. They don’t need social media.”View image in fullscreenIsaac Kenevan, who died when he was 13.This year, the Online Safety Act comes into force, which will create a duty of care for platforms to take action against illegal content or content that could be harmful to children where they are likely to come into contact with it. Walsh said he had “no faith” in Ofcom, which will implement the act.Dance said the platforms should pay an organisation to “screen every single video” before it was uploaded.Walsh said that if the US courts determined that “an algorithm sent my child destructive videos and it led to her mindset being into a downward spiral of which she didn’t feel she could get out of”, then he would like to bring corporate manslaughter charges in the UK courts.Roome said the families had filed the lawsuit in the US after coming across the Social Media Victims Law Center because they couldn’t get any UK lawyers to take on the case on a pro bono basis.View image in fullscreenEllen Roome and her son Jools.

The programme will not be available on iPlayer while this is taking place.”The BBC had initially said it would “add some more detail to the film” and leave it available to view on catch-up services. But the escalating pressure prompted executives to take firmer action.Critics of the programme, led by the former BBC One controller Danny Cohen, are asking whether the BBC paid any member of Hamas – a banned terrorist organisation in the UK – as part of the filming of the documentary, which aired on BBC2 on Monday night.Cohen said on Friday that the “documentary fails the most basic of programme standards” because “links to the terrorist group Hamas were not disclosed” and said that “it appears that children have been manipulated by terrorists”.Based on nine months of observational footage filmed in the run-up to last month’s ceasefire, three of the documentary’s main characters are children. It was produced by an independent company, Hoyo films.The day after transmission, the activist and journalist David Collier revealed that the 14-year-old English-speaking narrator, Abdullah, was the son of a Hamas deputy minister for agriculture, Ayman al-Yazouri.Collier described Abdullah “as the child of Hamas royalty” and pointed out his family connection to the group was not explained in the programme. Yazouri’s profile on LinkedIn says he helps “supervise, facilitate and support agricultural activities in Gaza Strip”.At the beginning of the film, Abdullah, then 13, asks viewers: “Have you ever wondered what you’d do if your world is destroyed?” He continues: “Most important, could you stay alive? After all this, you could say we’re experts.”The International Centre of Justice for Palestinians criticised the concerns raised, and urged the BBC to “stand firm against these attempts to prevent first-hand accounts of life in Gaza from reaching audiences”.A statement from the London-based organisation said: “For some, almost any Palestinian perspective appears to be deemed unacceptable. In this case, objections have been raised because Abdullah’s father holds a government role in Gaza’s Hamas-run administration. However, this does not negate the child’s lived experience or invalidate his testimony.”The documentary features Palestinians criticising Hamas on several occasions, and has been praised for its close-up observational style intended to humanise the situation in the territory.After Collier’s criticism, 45 prominent Jewish journalists and members of the media signed a letter demanding the programme be taken down. Signatories included Cohen, the former BBC governor Ruth Deech, the Friday Night Dinner and EastEnders actor Tracy-Ann Oberman and the Strike producer Neil Blair.“Given the serious nature of these concerns, the BBC should immediately postpone any broadcast repeats of the programme, remove it from iPlayer and take down any social media clips of the programme until an independent investigation is carried out and its findings published with full transparency for licence-fee payers,” the letter said.The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, has said she will talk to the BBC about “the way in which they sourced the people who were featured in the programme”. Allies said she intended to raise the topic as part of her routine engagement with the broadcaster.Nandy said: “These things are difficult and I do want to acknowledge that the BBC take more care than most broadcasters … They’ve been attacked for being too pro-Gaza, they’ve been attacked for being anti-Gaza.”Explore more on these topicsBBCGazaMiddle East and north AfricaTelevisionIsrael-Gaza warHamasPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

A group of councillors have also been administratively suspended from the party.“Swift action will be taken if individuals are found to have breached the high standards expected of them as Labour party members,” a spokesperson has said.The Guardian hasreported that the partywas warned more than a year ago about the WhatsApp group involving two of its MPs, local councillors and a series of offensive messages.Gwynne said in a statement after his sacking: “I deeply regret my badly misjudged comments and apologise for any offence I’ve caused.

Income from corporation tax and capitals gains tax was also below its own predictions.Rachel Reeves needs a more substantial boost to the public finances to stay withinthe government’s fiscal rules, which put limits on the annual deficit and the level of debt by the end of the parliament.Reeves is due to make her spring statement to the House of Commons on 26 March, when she is likely to revise some spending plans to stay within the budget constraints.Demands for extra spending on public services and the need to increase defence spendingto join European efforts to support Ukraineare being considered at the Treasury while the bill for borrowing on international financial markets has increased.Arise in the interest rate on government borrowinglast month proved short-lived but the cost of monthly debt payments remains elevated.Reeves said on Thursday that the UK would need to find funds to support higher military spending, but this would have to be found from savings elsewhere in the government budget plans.Responding to the January finances figures, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, said they highlighted the need to examine “every pound spent, line by line”, which he said was being done for the first time in 17 years, “ensuring every penny delivers on the country’s priorities in our plan for change”.There are fears among Labour backbench MPs that many of the initiatives to improve public services with extra investment will be shelved andwelfare claimants will have a tougher time.Business surveys have shown a sharp deterioration in the outlook for the UK economy this year, leading the Bank of England tohalve its 2025 growth forecast to 0.75%.S&P Global’s latest barometer of UK businesses showed the trend continuing after private sector activity improved only modestly this month and job losses accelerated. S&P Global said companies blamed the prospect of higher employment taxes for the job cuts.This survey was in contrast to others, notablythe GfK consumer confidence report and a poll by the recruiters body, the CIPD, which revealed a rebound in hiring intentions and household spending in February.SeparateOffice for National Statistics(ONS) figures on retail sales volumes out on Friday also showed an improvement in the new year, rising 1.7% on the previous month when seasonally adjusted and beating City expectations of a 0.5% increase.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That offset the lost sales reported by clothing retailers and household goods stores, the ONS said.The public finances worsened after borrowing in the financial year from April 2024 to January was £118.2bn, up £11.6bn on the same period in the last financial year and the fourth-highest financial year-to-January borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, the ONS said.Debt interest payments reached £6.5bn in January alone, the second highest January figure since monthly records began 27 years ago, the ONS said.Nabil Taleb, an economist at the accountants PwC, said higher debt payments against a backdrop of weak economic growth reflected the fiscal challenge the chancellor faced. “Higher debt servicing costs as a share of total revenues will leave the public finances more exposed to future economic shocks,” he said.Alex Kerr, an economist at the consultants CapitalEconomics, said January’s figures “will do nothing to reduce the chancellor’s challenges. Even before the ratcheting up of pressure on European governments to increase defence spending, the chancellor’s options ahead of the fiscal update next month were bleak.”The ONS said that taken together, self-assessed income and capital gains tax receipts were provisionally estimated at £36.2bn in January 2025, £3.8bn more than a year earlier, and the highest January receipts since monthly records began in 1999, although 10.1% lower than OBR forecasts.The chancellor usually enjoys a spending surplus in the first month of the year, which coincides with the deadline for self-assessment returns. The boost usually extends into February, whenHMRCcounts the millions of tax returns filed at the last minute.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsRachel ReevesTax and spendingOffice for Budget ResponsibilityOffice for National StatisticsHMRCEconomic policyShareReuse this content"

There was no immediate comment from the militant group on the IDF’s allegation.The remains of the Bibas children, 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz, and a fourth unidentified person who was supposed to be Shiri Bibas, were handed over to Israel on Thursday as part of the first stage of a fragile ceasefire agreement.1:35Israel demands return of Shiri Bibas’s body as Hamas claims it is mixed with other remains – videoHamas said Shiri’s body had been “mistakenly mixed” with others who were killed and buried under the rubble inGaza, after the Israeli military said DNA testing showed the woman’s body released was not Shiri Bibas or any other hostage.Hamas said it was investigating the issue and, late on Friday, released another body to the Red Cross, claiming that it was that of Shiri Babas. Israeli medical authorities said forensic teams were preparing to examine the body.Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, was quick to capitalise on the crisis, accusing Hamas of breaking the truce’s terms. “We will work with determination to bring Shiri home together with all our hostages – both living and dead – and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and malicious violation of the agreement,” he said in a statement.However, relatives of the family have accused the Israeli leader of abandoning their loved ones. They also warned against using their fate as a pretext for a return to fighting amid uncertainty over implementation of the next phase of the deal, which is due to begin in early March.In the second stage, Hamas is supposed to return the remainder of the hostages in exchange for Israel ending the war, but Netanyahu has long resisted pressure to end the hostilities: much of his far-right coalition government opposes such a step if it leaves Hamas as a significant force inside the Gaza Strip. The third phase is supposed to address the exchange of bodies, a reconstruction plan for Gaza and future governance.“It was Israel’s responsibility and obligation to bring them back alive,” said Shiri’s sister-in-law, Ofri Bibas, in a statement released on behalf of the family through the Israeli campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.“Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, we did not receive an apology from you in this painful moment.“Our painful journey, which has already lasted 16 months, is not over. We are still waiting for Shiri … For Ariel and Kfir’s sake, and for Yarden’s sake, we are not seeking revenge right now. We are asking for Shiri.“Their cruelty only emphasises the urgent need to bring Shiri back to us, save the lives of the living hostages and return all the fallen for burial,” she said.The truce in the war in Gaza came into effect on 19 January, pausing 15 months of brutal fighting that killed about 48,000 Palestinians and triggered a devastating humanitarian crisis. About 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas attack that ignited the war, and 250 were taken hostage.On Friday, Hamas released the names of the six living hostages it plans to release at the weekend under the terms of the ceasefire. The Palestinian prisoners media office said more than 600 Palestinian prisoners were also to be freed.The announcements are a sign that the fragile deal remains on track despite the tensions caused by the furore surrounding the Bibas’s fate.Also on Friday, Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said he had ordered the country’s military to ramp up its operations in the occupied West Bank after a series of bus explosions near Tel Aviv the previous day. There were no casualties in the blasts, which a group identifying itself as a branch of Hamas’ military wing, al-Qassam Brigades, from the West Bank city of Tulkarem, stopped short of taking responsibility for in a Telegram post.Israel’s latest operation in the West Bank, launched immediately after the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, has wreaked widespread damage, killed more than 50 Palestinians, caused thousands to flee their homes and ripped up roads and infrastructure in refugee camps.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaHamasBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

He wrote that he was satisfied by the administration’s assurances in court filings thatUSAidpersonnel abroad who were placed on leave would still be protected by US security.Nichols, who was appointed by Donald Trump during his first term, also wrote that, because the affected employees had not gone through an administrative dispute process, he likely did not have jurisdiction to hear the unions’ case or consider their broader arguments that the administration is violating the US constitution by shutting down an agency created and funded by Congress.“We are disappointed in today’s decision and believe the harms faced by USAid workers are real. We remain confident that the courts will find the administration’s efforts to decimate USAid contrary to law,” said Skye Perryman, president of the legal non-profit Democracy Forward, which represents the unions, in a statement.Trump’s dismantling of USAid raises risk of mpox global emergency, experts warnRead moreThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The lawsuit was brought earlier this month by the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Foreign Service Association. The global anti-poverty group Oxfam has since joined the case, though Nichols has not yet considered its claims.Trump ordered a 90-day freeze on all foreign aid on his first day in office, throwing global humanitarian relief efforts into chaos.In the following weeks, officials took steps that have largely shut down USAid’s operations, including placing much of its staff on leave, suspending or terminating most of its contracts and shuttering its Washington headquarters.Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a 4 February letter to Congress that he had taken over as acting director of USAid, which Congress established as an agency independent of the state department in 1998. He wrote that the state department would consult with Congress about absorbing parts of USAid and shutting down the rest.The foreign aid freeze and potential USAid shutdown have prompted multiple legal challenges.Nichols’ order comes a day after a different judge, who is presiding over lawsuits brought against the administration by foreign aid contractors and grant recipients, for the second time ordered the administration to resume payments on frozen contracts and grants after it failed to comply with an earlier order.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUSAidUS politicsLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

South Carolina now directs those on death row to choose how they will be killed – electric chair, lethal injection or shooting. If they decline to make a selection, the state electrocutes them.Attorneys for men on South Carolina’s death row have previously objected to firing squads, raising concerns about the pain caused by shootings and arguing the methodconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment. But Sigmon selected a firing squad in part because of concerns about the state’s lethal injection methods, his attorneys said.The last three executions in the state were carried out with injections of pentobarbital, a sedative. Each time, it took more than 20 minutes for the men to die, and in one case, it appeared to cause a man to suffer a condition akin todrowning and suffocation, lawyers for the men said in court filings. Sigmon’s lawyers have also raised concerns about the secrecy surrounding the state’s lethal injection drugs and protocols.“He has a right to this choice, but it’s not an informed choice,” Gerald “Bo” King, one of Sigmon’s lawyers, said in an interview. “My frustration is we are in a world where he has to choose between being electrocuted, poisoned or shot, and we can’t even get the most basic facts you would want to make that decision.”He wanted his father’s killer to be executed. Until his wish was grantedRead moreSouth Carolina had ceased executions since 2011 in part because it ran out of lethal injection supplies as pharmaceutical companies faced pressure to stop selling drugs to facilitate state killings. But lawmakers in 2023 passed a shield law to keep the identity of suppliers secret, allowing officials to restock lethal drugs and resume executions last year.Sigmon’s attorneys noted in a recent filing that the South Carolina department of corrections (SCDC) was obliged to “disclose some basic facts about the drug’s creation, quality and reliability” and criticized prison officials for failing to provide information about the “potency, purity and stability” of the drugs, their expiration dates, and how they are being tested and stored.In the execution ofRichard Moorein November, autopsy records suggested officials injected him with a second dose of pentobarbital after 10 minutes had passed, even though the SCDC has said the injections are to happen “via a single dose”, lawyers said. His autopsy also showed his lungs were swollen with fluid, “an excruciating condition known as pulmonary edema”.After the Januaryexecution of Marion Bowman, which took roughly 23 minutes, an SCDC officialdeclinedto say how many doses were injected, saying: “We followed our protocol and that is not disclosed.”“You have three executions that have seemingly gone awry,” said King, pointing to previous cases in other states ofbotched executions by lethal injectionandmishandling of the drugs. “It could be excruciatingly painful.”South Carolina officials have previously said that the firing squad protocols involve strapping the person to a chair with an “aim point” placed on his heart and a hood covering his head. Three men armed with rifles will then shoot from behind a wall 15ft away with an opening in it.In 2022, a South Carolina judgesaidthis method “constitutes torture” and was “cruel” and unconstitutional. The judge noted the person was “likely to be conscious for a minimum of 10 seconds after impact” and the pain could be extended “if the ammunition does not fully incapacitate the heart”: “During this time, he will feel excruciating pain resulting from the gunshot wounds and broken bones.” If the person’s vital signs were still present 10 minutes after the first shots, staff would fire a second time, the judge noted.Last year, the state supreme courtruledall methods were lawful since officials were giving the men a choice of method.Sigmon’s potential killing by firing squad comes at a time of increasing scrutiny of methods of execution across the country, and as Donald Trump has pledged torevive capital punishment at the federal leveland help ensure that states have “sufficient supplies” to carry out killings. Alabama has recently been using nitrogen hypoxia, a suffocation method human rights groups sayamounts to torture.Five states currently allow firing squads, andIdaho lawmakersare now pushing to make it the primary execution method. The last firing squad execution in the US wasin 2010 in Utah, theonly stateto use this method in the last 50 years.“I expect many members of the public will be shocked by the graphic and bloody display that will result from a firing squad execution,” said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. “Unlike other forms of execution, this will look exactly like what it is: the deliberate and intentional taking of life by the state, using a vivid and brutal method.”The recent South Carolina executions have been observed by several journalists, and the state’s protocols say the firing squad chair would not directly face witnesses, but observers would see the “right-side profile” of the person being killed.Chrysti Shain, an SCDC spokesperson, said in an email that its lethal injection policies mirrored federal guidelines and that the last three executions “followed protocol”. The US justice department, however,withdrewits pentobarbital protocol in January, just before Trump’s inauguration, citing “uncertainty” over whether the drug “causes unnecessary pain and suffering”.Shain also pointed to the court declaration of an anesthesiologist hired by the state, who said pentobarbital on average would cause unconsciousness within 20 to 30 seconds, and that the individual would not feel pain or suffocation.Sigmon was convicted of the 2001 murders of his ex-girlfriend’s parents. Sigmon admitted his guilt in court, and his lawyers have argued that the killings stemmed from a childhood of physical abuse and neglect and severe, inherited mental illness that went undiagnosed and untreated. In a petition filed on Thursday seeking to stop the execution, his lawyers argued that Sigmon’s trial counsel failed to present evidence of his trauma and mental illness.“This was a horrible crime that was a product of this convergence of mental illness and organic brain injuries that amplified his manic and irrational episodes,” said King, who is the chief of the capital habeas unit for the fourth circuit, which is part of the federal public defender’s office. “Brad is enormously remorseful. He’s a devout Christian and spends a tremendous amount of time on prayer and penitence. He repents every day for what he’s done.”Over the years, Sigmon has become a “source of strength and stability to everyone in the prison – the fellow prisoners, and the guards”, King added.Sigmon would be the oldest person ever executed by South Carolina. In an earlier statement when Sigmon’s execution date was announced, King said: “Executing Brad would serve no purpose except to send a single, chilling message: no matter how profoundly a person repents, South Carolina refuses to recognize redemption.”Explore more on these topicsSouth CarolinaCapital punishmentUS crimeLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Another administration official told the outlet that the Ice team was going to be expanded.Vitello was hand-picked by Trump last December and has 23 years of experience with Ice.In a statement on Truth Social explaining his pick, Trumpsaid: “A member of the Senior Executive Service, with over 23 years of service to [Ice], Caleb currently serves as Assistant Director of the Office of Firearms and Tactical Programs, where he oversees Agency-wide training, equipment, and policy to ensure Officer and Public Safety.”Trump added: “Caleb’s exceptional leadership, extensive experience, and commitment to [Ice]’s mission make him an excellent choice to implement my efforts to enhance the safety and security of American communities who have been victimized by illegal alien crime.”The latest reshuffling follows the recentreassignmentof Russell Hott and Peter Berg at Ice due to frustrations from the Trump administration over the rate of deportations and arrest numbers.Speaking tothe Washington Post which first reported the reassignments of Hott and Berg, a DHS spokesperson said: “Ice needs a culture of accountability that it has been starved of for the past four years. We have a president, DHS secretary, and American people who rightfully demand results, and our Ice leadership will ensure the agency delivers.”According to the outlet, Hott was reassigned to Ice’s local office in Washington while Berg was reassigned to the office in St Paul, Minnesota.Since Trump’s return to the presidency on 20 January, immigration officials have beenarresting826 people daily. At that rate, Trump’s administration would make nearly 25,000 immigration-related arrests in the first 30 days of his second presidency, more than any other month in the past 11 years, which included his first presidency from 2017 to 2021.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Days before an election in which the far right is expected to catapult into second place in Germany’s parliament, the simultaneous rallies in 50 municipalities were billed as a show of strength by an LGBTQ+ community as people braced for what might lie ahead.“Many queer people are unsettled by the social and political situation,” the organisers of the mid-February, cross-country initiative wrote ontheir website. “The tone against us is getting harsher, and liberal democracy is under pressure.”For years, rights campaigners have come up against the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) andits oppositionto marriage equality, safe community spaces and access to healthcare and reproductive justice.Sunday’s election, however, could leave the LGBTQ+ community grappling with an intensified challenge as polls suggest support for the AfD is set to double, yielding a result that would be unprecedented in the country’s postwar history.Alva Träbert, a board member of Germany’s LGBTQ+ umbrella group LSVD and Federation Queer Diversity, said: “We are looking at political actors openly including anti-queer and anti-trans policy in their campaigns as part of a larger effort to scapegoat marginalised groups for bigger social issues, while simultaneously legitimising discrimination and hate towards them.”The AfD’s manifesto for the upcoming election defines family as a “father, mother and children”, to the exclusion of all other forms of families. It calls for minors to be protected from what it describes as “the trans cult, early sexualisation and gender ideology”.In recent years, assupport has surgedfor the far right, the impact has been palpable: campaigners said they were aware of at least 26 attacks by far-right protesters on Pride marches last year. Träbert said in an email: “As heartbreaking and frightening as this development is, it is an unsurprising consequence of the proliferation and normalisation of anti-queer and anti-trans sentiment in politics and the media. We know this from our history: violence begins with words – and words become actions.”Träbert said that as the community had grappled with fear and uncertainty, it had been met with love and support from some quarters, with people travelling across Germany to attend Pride events in person, and others becoming activists for the first time.In the lead-up to Sunday’s elections,polls suggestthe conservative CDU-CSU bloc could emerge as the most-voted party, with about 28% of the vote, followed by the AfD.While the conservative opposition leader, Friedrich Merz, has ruled out any formal cooperation with the AfD, herecently leanedon the party to support a non-binding resolution on border policy, marking a historic breach of a taboo.His willingness to do so added to concerns about the influence of the AfD, said Träbert. “Over the past months, it has been increasingly concerning to see more centrist parties aiming to win back the electorate by appropriating the AfD’s talking points and policies.”Both Merz’s party and the AfD have vowed to revoke theself-determination law, which took effect last November and made it easierfor people to reflect their preferred names and gender on official records. The shared promise posed a “serious threat” to transgender, non-binary and intersex people, Träbert said.The far right’s consistent efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights seemingly contradicts its candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, a lesbian woman who is raising two sons with her Sri Lankan-born wife.“I would say Alice Weidel serves as a kind of fig leaf,” said Constantin Wurthmann, a political scientist at the University of Mannheim. “Because if you say the AfD is racist, you can point to Alice Weidel’s partner who is not white.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I would say that while she has this sexual orientation, she doesn’t share the identity of the community at all.”The AfD did not reply to a request for comment. Speaking to the Financial Times earlier this year, one senior AfD officialsought to explain the paradoxin this way: “She is just gay by biology, but not by political conviction.”In recent months Weidel has courted allies known for their strong stance against LGBTQ+ rights, from Elon Musk,who blamed“the woke mind virus” for his transgender daughter Vivian’s transition; to Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who last yearwas accusedof using a “machinery of fear” to attack the LGBTQ+ community.The apparent contradictions were put to Weidel earlier this month when she visited Budapest to meet Orbán. In an open letter, the Labrisz Lesbian Association, one of the co-founders of the Budapest Pride parade, laid bare what it meant to be LGBTQ+ in Orbán’s Hungary.The letter said:“Welcome to a country where lesbians cannot participate in artificial insemination programmes, cannot adopt children, and if they already have children, only one of them can exercise parental rights.”The association contrasted the situation with Orbán’s reception of the AfD. “Orbán and his homophobic comrades, with their political interests in mind, will no doubt discreetly excuse you for being a lesbian. Orbán will certainly not lecture you that you are unfit to bring up children and that you are corrupting your children. And you will discreetly not think of your partner and two children while smiling into the cameras as you shake hands with Orbán.”The letter finished with a query, echoing the question that had been asked across Hungary, Germany and beyond after the AfD’s announcement of Weidel’s visit to Budapest. “Dear Alice Weidel, what message are you sending to Hungarian lesbians with your visit?”Explore more on these topicsGermanyThe far rightEuropeLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

No. But if the question is ‘is he in danger of death?’, the answer is [also] ‘no’,” Alfieri said, adding that the pope was aware of how serious the situation was. “The pope knows this. He said: ‘I realise that the situation is serious’,” he said.Francis was admitted to hospital last Friday after suffering from what he said was bronchitis for more than a week. He was later diagnosed witha respiratory tract infection and pneumoniaon both lungs,a combination which doctors said made his therapeutic treatment more complex.The pope was “in good humour”, Alfieri said, and on Friday visited the hospital’s chapel to pray. He was also able to do some work, but his health condition could “change day to day” so he would remain in hospital for the whole of next week at least.The pope was taking a “significant” medication load and would not be discharged until he was fully out of the woods, because if he returned home, he would just start working again, said Alfieri. “We need to focus on getting through this phase … the pope is not a person who gives up.”View image in fullscreenSergio Alfieri, a general surgeon at Gemelli University hospital in Rome, told reporters the pope was ‘in good humour’.Photograph: Giuseppe Lami/EPAAlfieri said the pope was “a fragile patient” given his previous health concerns. However, he stressed that the pontiff was “not attached to any machinery” and when he needed to, he put on the nasal cannula “for a little oxygen”, but otherwise he “breathes spontaneously and feeds himself”.He said the pope did not have sepsis, a potentially life-threatening condition when a body responds to an infection by harming its own tissue and organs. However, he said there was always a risk that the infection could spread.Francis had part of his lung removed in his early 20s while he was training to be a priest in his native Argentina.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And will the lottery operator pay out?In whatLe Parisiennewspaper described as a story worthy of a film script, the homeless pair broke into a car parked in the centre of Toulouse, in south-west France, on 3 February and stole a backpack containing credit cards and identity documents belonging to a local man the paper named only as Jean-David.The victim, 42, reported the theft to the police and contacted his bank to block his credit cards. He asked if the cards had been used and was informed that at 3pm that day, the thieves had used one of the cards to buy goods worth €52.50 (about £43.50) at a city-centre newsagents less than 500 metres from where his car had been parked.More concerned about finding his identity papers, Jean-David decided to visit the newsagents the next morning to explain what had happened and see if they had CCTV to identify the thieves.“I hoped at least to get my papers back but the newsagent said he hadn’t found anything. He said he remembered the two homeless men aged 30-40 coming into the shop and buying cigarettes and scratchcards. He found their behaviour suspicious because they paid with one card then wanted to buy something else but it hadn’t gone through and they couldn’t put in the code,” he told police.After scratching the card and discovering they had won the maximum payout of €500,000 (nearly £414,000) the overjoyed pair returned to the shop to collect their winnings and were told to contact Française des Jeux, the company that runs France’s national lottery and had produced the scratchcard.“The shop owner’s wife said she doubted very much I’d find them because she’d checked the card and they had won €500,000. She said they were so happy they even forgot their five packets of cigarettes,” Jean-David said.Since then, the situation remains in a legal limbo. The thieves have not tried to collect their ill-gotten gains and police in Toulouse say Française des Jeux has frozen the winning ticket while investigations continue.Jean-David has now invited the thieves to contact his lawyer. “Why not find a friendly arrangement? Why not share it?” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She talks old flames, being tucked up in bed for her new Agatha Christie mystery, and why she’s happiest when surrounded by donkeysFri 21 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTShareGiven that Lady Tressilian rarely leaves her boudoir, it was an enjoyable role. “I was very happily in bed, one of my favourite places, generally,” saysAnjelica Huston, of the regal aristo she plays in the new BBC adaptation of the 1944 Agatha Christie mystery Towards Zero. Despite the fact she is mostly horizontal, occasionally at a chair by the window and peering through a telescope at the Devon bay beyond, Tressilian is a domineering character, presiding over the younger relations she has assembled at her seaside home and making her displeasure known at their various life choices. There will, of course, be murders.Huston was reminded of the older women she had known from her childhood in Ireland, “mostly on the hunting field, but occasionally in their bedrooms. They were very dignified and gracious, and they ran life with a rod of steel. They were very brave and had big reputations. The men were always a bit in the background.” Tressilian’s bell rings, and everyone from servants to her relations and lawyer (he’s there on the thorny matter of her will), is commanded to attention. “It’s a great way to presage a character, an inbuilt warning,” says Huston.In Huston’s long and impressive career – one that won her an Oscar in 1986 for Prizzi’s Honor, and has seen her work with just about everybody including Francis Ford Coppola, Woody Allen and Wes Anderson, as well as her father, John Huston – she has arrived at the regal roles. Her Lady Tressilian is elegant and beautiful, and also looks her age. This is not a role that, to unfairly name names, someone such as Jane Fonda and her fabulous facelift could have played convincingly. “It’s true, she looks too good,” says Huston, who is 73, with a laugh.View image in fullscreen‘I was very happily in bed’ … Anjelica Huston as Lady Tressilian in the BBC Agatha Christie adaptation, Towards Zero.Photograph: James PardonThere doesn’t seem to be a huge amount of vanity to Huston. A great beauty, though unconventional, she was largely spared the maddening fate of leading actresses who were aged out of roles, and she thinks of herself as “a character actor first. Those are the roles that have always appealed to me, the ones that have something going on underneath.” It’s one reason she wanted to play Tressilian, a small but delicious role. “When I was a child, I used to watch a lot of restoration comedy, and I knew those actresses’ work very well – Edith Evans and Margaret Rutherford – and they were guiding lights. There was no shame to having fun with playing women of a certain age.”She loves to work but, she adds, “not too hard, and with people I love”. Home for now is her ranch, where she’s calling from after fleeing her Los Angeles home in the wildfires. “It’s been kind of a scary month,” she says. “My house almost burned down. It came very, very close. My electricity and water and power are still off, but we were safe.” She hopes to return soon, but her luck at having a beautiful place to escape to is not lost on her. There, she has seven donkeys, six horses and countless dogs and cats. “I’m always happiest when I’m surrounded by my animals.”Huston doesn’t seem old enough to have packed in what seems like several lifetimes. Her parents, the swashbuckling director John Huston and Enrica Soma, a model and ballerina, moved from the US to Ireland in the early 1950s, in horror at the McCarthy witch-hunts. For Huston, it was a wild, country childhood, punctuated with visits from fabulous friends of her parents – the war photographer Robert Capa photographed Huston and her older brother as toddlers; the writer John Steinbeck dressed up as Father Christmas one year. School holidays were spent on her father’s sets. When her parents separated and Huston moved to England, she hit London in the 60s as it was in full swing. By the time she was a model – first photographed by Richard Avedon, a friend of her mother, and soon by David Bailey – and living in New York, she was there in time for the Studio 54 years, befriending Andy Warhol and others.View image in fullscreenFamily plot… Anjelica Huston (far right) in Wes Anderson’s The Royal Tenenbaums.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyIt wasn’t all glitter. Huston’s mother died in a car accident when she was 17. Huston had a couple of relationships that could be considered abusive, and she can’t escape the fact that she was an unwitting witness – though she maintains she didn’t see anything – following Roman Polanski’s arrest for drugging and raping a 13-year-old. Huston had arrived at her on-off boyfriend Jack Nicholson’s house the next day, to find Polanski there with the girl, Samantha Gailey. Huston has said before that Polanski, who fled the US before sentencing in 1978, had “paid his price”. Has anything changed her mind in the intervening years? “No, nothing’s changed,” says Huston. “I didn’t see it, I wasn’t privy to it. I don’t feel like I was part of it.”Huston always wanted to be an actor. “From the age of six,” she says, “when I played one of the three witches in Macbeth. Actually, I left the stage rather prematurely – I declared that I didn’t like it, made myself scarce for a few hours, but I always had a weakness for character acting.” What grabbed her about it? “The reality of it – of playing a mean old witch. It was one of the more fun things you could do.”When she was 16, her father cast her in A Walk With Love and Death. It didn’t go well – they clashed on set, and her reviews were terrible. How did that affect her? “I didn’t work for years after that. He thought he was doing me a big favour and, in fact, it was very difficult. I didn’t really like the part, and it left me a bit at sea. I wasn’t comfortable, and I went back to London and went back to school, very despondent.” It shook her confidence and it would be about four years before she tried acting again. “I knew that I could act, but I didn’t know how to convince anyone else that I knew how to act.”Instead, she became a model. For many young women, it was an industry with situations that were dangerous and intimidating, but Huston says she didn’t experience that. “I worked with really good people who were very protective. It was a very freeing atmosphere, and the designers and the photographers were always very much on my side. I felt like I could do anything.” It was a time for young women, she says, where “we were the first rung of girls who were allowed to have a good time. It was encouraged, we were kind of wild.”View image in fullscreen‘A small but delicious role’ … Anjelica Huston gives an imperious performance in the classic murder mystery.Photograph: Justin Downing/James PardonShe had a much older boyfriend, the fashion photographer Bob Richardson – she was 18 to his 42. Does that not look dubious with a modern perspective on power dynamics? “It was dubious then,” she points out. “He, I would say, was the least good thing about all of that [period], in that I felt like I had to please him. He was a great photographer and knew exactly what he wanted, and there’s nothing better than that, but he was also very challenging and critical, and I had a hard time negotiating how to be.”It didn’t diminish her; Huston seemed to have a well of self-confidence. She wasn’t knocked when one powerful modelling agent told her she needed a nose job, nor when a producer refused to give her a pay rise on Prizzi’s Honor and she overheard him telling her agent she was no good, and he hadn’t wanted her in the film anyway. How did that not crush her? “I think my reaction, which was healthy, was: ‘Well, watch me.’ I always came out swinging and I didn’t have to make excuses for myself. I remember being properly outraged, and thinking: ‘He thinks he knows, but he doesn’t, so I’ll just show him.’” Her performance won her an Oscar.By then, Huston had been in a long relationship with Nicholson, who also starred in the film. Nicholson’s infidelities were legendary over their on-off 17-year relationship, ending finally in 1990 when he fathered a child with someone else (Huston soon would have a happy marriage to the sculptor Robert Graham, until his death in 2008). Why did she stay with Nicholson for so long? “I loved him. I think in the world that I was living in, it wasn’t disrespectful. It was how he was, and it wasn’t so personal. I think as soon as I clocked that, it was all right, I knew how to protect myself. It didn’t make me happy, but I knew what I was doing.” It allowed her to prioritise herself – with work, with other lovers. “I did what I wanted to do, and I did it with sureness. If I wanted something, I knew how to go after it, so it wasn’t as though anything was being done to me. I wasn’t a wilting flower.”They are still in touch. Nicholson called Huston recently as she was fleeing the wildfires. “I was in a car with three dogs, two cats, and the housekeeper, and he called and asked if I was all right, and if I had someplace I was staying. That’s the bottom line with he and I – when the chips are down, he’s there.”Life has taught her to look for beauty: “Remember to admire what’s beautiful and be on the side of beauty and on the side of what you can do to make things better.” She does this when she thinks about her country. “America, at the moment, is in a sad and sorry state. I think it has a lot to learn and hopefully won’t have to learn it the hard way. The world is beautiful, and if you can find something beautiful in [the US], then you’re already on the right track.” It’s hard not to be hopeless, she says, “but there’s a lot to admire too.”Agatha Christie’s Towards Zero starts on BBC One, and is available in full on BBC iPlayer, on 2 March.Explore more on these topicsAnjelica HustonTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

He had been living with Parkinson’s disease.Born to a poor family in Mississippi and then raised in Chicago, Butler originally trained to be a chef – “Jerry could cook like somebody’s mama,” Smokey Robinson later said – but became an influential and versatile musician who came of age as soul music evolved out of doo-wop and mid-century pop.He brought his gospel music background to bear on one of his earliest songs, For Your Precious Love – named as one of the500 greatest of all time by Rolling Stone in 2004– which he wrote and then performed with his group Jerry Butler and the Impressions, taking it to No 11 in the US charts in 1958.View image in fullscreenJerry Butler, top left, and Curtis Mayfield, bottom right, in the Impressions.Photograph: Gilles Petard/RedfernsThe group also featured Butler’s childhood friend Curtis Mayfield, who fronted them after Butler left for a solo career – they found further success with songs such as People Get Ready. But the Butler-Mayfield collaboration continued, with Mayfield writing or co-writing a number of solo Butler songs, including He Will Break Your Heart, a No 7 hit in 1960. Butler also co-wrote other hits, such as Otis Redding’s I’ve Been Loving You Too Long.Butler also found success with his takes on a series of pop standards, including Moon River and Make It Easy on Yourself, but his biggest hit of all was self-penned: Only the Strong Survive, which reached No 4 in 1969. It was co-written with powerhouse Philadelphia duo Gamble and Huff, and together they scored a number of other hits. He earned the nickname “Iceman” for his cool, collected demeanour on stage: “I came through a period when the Isley Brothers were jumping off the stage, and James Brown was sliding across the floor. But I am just a standup singer,” he said.A cover of He Will Break Your Heart became a US No 1 hit for Tony Orlando and Dawn in 1975, under the title He Don’t Love You (Like I Love You). But his own musical success waned in that decade, and he ended up focusing on a beer distribution company he’d founded in 1973.Come the 1980s, he decided to move into politics, and in 1986 was elected to the Board of Commissioners in Cook County, Illinois – it acts as the legislature for the area, and oversees courts, prisons, healthcare and more. He held a position on the 17-strong board until his retirement in 2018.He was made a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 as a member of the Impressions, and his sizeable songbook was also later sampled by hip-hop artists including Snoop Dogg and Missy Elliott.Explore more on these topicsSoulPop and rockIllinoisnewsShareReuse this content"

Now that Neighbours is doomed, it needs to end with a bangAfter the Austalian soap’s previous false ending, it’s almost impossible to imagine it getting a second starry finale – or it finding a new home. This time, its farewell needs to stickStuart HeritageFri 21 Feb 2025 09.50 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 09.53 ESTShareIt’s always sad to write an obituary, especially so when it’s for the second time. Neighbours, the Australian soap opera that made stars of everyone from Kylie Minogue to a man who will forever be known asToadfish, is five months away from death. Again.Yesterday, the show announced that Amazon, the company that resuscitated Neighbours two years ago after its dramatic 2022 finale, would be bringingproduction to an end. In July, filming will cease. In December, the final episode will be shown. True, there is the possibility that another buyer will leap in and save it, but that is looking more and more unlikely. After all, as the saying goes, you can’t make a zombie out of a zombie.Obviously, there’s a lot to examine from the news. Perhaps the most important lesson is that legacy franchises should really think better of jumping into bed with big tech companies. Amazon proved this twice over yesterday alone;first by buying out Eon Productions, the British company that makes the James Bond films, hinting that it will transform a venerable 63-year-old property into a nightmarish Star Wars-style sausage factory of spin-offs and TV shows, and now this. When Amazon bought Neighbours, fans hoped it was a permanent solution, continuing the soap in perpetuity. But streamers operate on a different metric to traditional broadcasters – a long-running show with a loyal audience won’t increase the number of subscribers as much as something buzzy and new – and so it has once again been snuffed out of existence.But hope springs eternal. Inevitably, someone has createda petition to save it. But even that barely has the energy to sustain itself, scraping together just over a thousand signatures in a day. Perhaps the time is right to let it go. After all, the entire history of the show has been spent teetering on the brink of cancellation.View image in fullscreenTakaya Honda (as David Tanaka), Hana Abe-Tucker (as Isla Tanaka-Brennan), Matt Wilson (as Aaron Brennan)Photograph: Jackson Finter/Amazon FreeveeIn Australia, the Seven Network cancelled it after four months before it was revived by Network Ten. It ran for 22 years on BBC One in the UK, until the channel abandoned it in 2008 after Freemantle demanded £300 million for the rights. It was saved when Channel 5 agreed to show it, paying for the bulk of production costs in the process. But even thatstarted to go south over financial disputesin 2017, before Channel 5 officially pulled the plug in 2022, tanking the show for the first time.You will remember that becausethe finale was a big deal. Several big stars who had outgrown Neighbours returned to mark the event, including Margot Robbie, Guy Pearce, Jason Donovan and a bizarrely mute Kylie Minogue. In truth it was a pretty good finale, ending with a wedding that served as a celebration of the history of Ramsay Street. If you’re old enough to have enjoyed Neighbours at its peak, it was a near-perfect send off. And then it was all undone the moment that Amazon bought the rights.View image in fullscreenFamous faces … Guy Pearce (Mike Young) and Annie Jones (Jane Harris) turned up for the first big Neighbours send off before Amazon stepped in.Photograph: Jonathan Birch/Amazon FreeveeThe new series has been, well, fine. It’s Neighbours, so it’s still equal parts plodding and implausible, but after using up all that energy saying goodbye to it once, it was hard to fully embrace its new incarnation. What was once a communal experience – playSuddenly by Angry Anderson, the soundtrack to Scott and Charlene’s wedding in 1987, to a roomful of people in their mid-40s and they’ll all end up snivelling with nostalgia – had become impossibly fragmented. At times it felt like you were the only person in the world watching Neighbours.Now there’s nowhere else to go. It seems likeNeighbourshas run out of road for good. Hopefully, this time it will do the dignified thing and stay dead. If nothing else, a new ending means that it will soon be time for a new finale. This is something to be excited about, at least. After all, the show has blown the chance of another celebrity-filled nostalgiafest because Kylie Minogue clearly isn’t going to risk her reputation by showing up to say goodbye again. So that only leaves the route of harrowing finality.This is Neighbours’ chance to go big or go home. Nothing short of total destruction will do. We’re talking plane crashes, volcanoes, axe murderers. By the time the end credits roll, I want the few remaining viewers permanently traumatised. We cannot risk the possibility of another embarrassing about-face here. If someone wants to make a petition to destroy Erinsborough with an asteroid attack, I promise to sign it first.Explore more on these topicsNeighboursTelevisionDramaSoap operafeaturesShareReuse this content"

A hundred years of reasons, of inequalities and wrongs and rights, of marches and riots, of peaceful sit-downs and kiss-ins, of fortitude and dissent and things kicking off. Things can get ugly. A fire bomb in the road, marbles under the horses’ hooves. Not resisting is uglier.Resistance also presents us with 100 years of photographs. Filled with incident and detail, personal shots and anonymous press images, documentary series and photographs found in archives and culled from collections, they range from journalistic assignments to surreptitious surveillance images, pictures by famous photographers and by anonymous agency ones. Conceived bySteve McQueenand curated by Clarrie Wallis, it is a show of fractured continuities and swerving vantage points.All the images have been scanned in black and white and hung in black frames. There are a few sepia-toned photos but no colour images. All the prints are relatively small and invite close looking. They gather and disperse and they march around the walls of the Turner Contemporary. The images home in and they pull back. We see crowds on the move and groups of the unemployed lying in the road to disrupt the traffic on Oxford Street.Protesters occupy tree houses high above the proposed Newbury bypass and they dance on the missile silos at Greenham Common. We find ourselves in courtrooms and cells, marching among millions and watching Arthur Scargill on the telly in someone’s sitting room in the north-east of England. There’s disenfranchised lassitude and the amazing creativity of the squatters who occupied scaffolding towers and netting above a row of houses to prevent their eviction. A couple dance wildly at an early Caribbean carnival in St Pancras Town Hall in 1959, sound systems are rigged-up in Notting Hill and anti-Iraq war activist Brian Haw begins his 670th day of protest opposite the Houses of Parliament in 2003 (his vigil lasted a decade, until his death in 2011).View image in fullscreenIndividuals as well as crowds … Brian Haw in 2005.Photograph: Andrew Wiard/reportphotos.comThere are riots in the Bogside; Tom Robinson performing at a Rock Against Racism carnival; anti-racists blocking a National Front demonstration in New Cross; and Humphrey Spender documenting the Great Depression in 1936, photographing kids playing in a derelict street in Jarrow and unemployed Tyneside workers on the Newcastle quay, the Tyne Bridge looming behind them. Images such as Spender’s, published in the popular Picture Post, gained enormous currency.Subtitled How Protest Shaped Britain andPhotographyShaped Protest, the exhibition ends at a point when social media and advances in smartphone technology began to irrevocably change our relationship with images, as well as the relationship between photographs and videos and truth.The exhibition is compelling in all sorts of ways. As social history, as documentary, as eye-witness report and as remembering, whether it is of the unemployment marches of the 1930s or the protests against the overwhelming silence surrounding the deaths of 13 young people in a house fire in New Cross in 1981. Resistance is more than a parade of markers or a timeline of dissent.Well-known protests such as the Grunwick Dispute in 1976-8, in which a group of mostly Indian female workers from east Africa walked out of the film processing factory in west London where they suffered low wages, intimidation and exploitation, or the demonstration against the poll tax in 1990, the battles for gay liberation and against Section 28, also meet largely forgotten protests here; members of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds protest “against the use of egret feathers in hats” at a demonstration in London in 1911, and blind people march from cities around England and Wales to London in 1920, petitioning for “Justice not Charity”. In the early 1990s, disabled protesters hold a “Piss on Pity” campaign challenging ITV’s patronising, celebrity telethon appeals, and 30 years on we have “crip rights” and protests.Resistance is more than a parade of markers or a timeline of dissentIt is easy to get caught up in the incidental details. The policeman wheeling his bike behind the Jarrow marchers. The kid, knock-kneed, hands in the pockets of his shorts, staring at the photographerChristine Spenglerwhile she’s taking a picture of a young British soldier on a Belfast corner in 1970. I do a double-take. The kid’s wearing a weirdly comical mask, his own resistance to the presence of soldiers on the streets.The young unemployed sit on the floor and lean at the counter in the dole office, inTish Murtha’s 1981 series Youth Unemployment. From the same series, kids leap from a high window on to a pile of old mattresses in a wretched, partly demolished housing block. An onlooker in the image is holding a ventriloquist’s dummy, which looks back out at us, a sort of bug-eyed rejoinder to our looking.John Deakin, then working for Picture Post, took a group of portraits of delegates at the 1945 Pan African Congress in Manchester. These included Jomo Kenyatta, future president of Kenya, and Jamaican Pan-African activist Amy Garvey. The photographer’s close friend Francis Bacon called Deakin the greatest portrait photographer sinceNadarandJulia Margaret Cameron.View image in fullscreen‘It is easy to get caught up in the incidental details’ … a demonstration against the imminent invasion of Iraq in London in 2003.Photograph: Andrew Wiard/reportphotos.comWe meet individuals as well as crowds here; Tony Benn, speaking in Trafalgar Square during the Suez crisis, and Bertrand Russell, at an anti-nuclear missile protest in 1961 (“Bertrand Russell – King of the kids!”, my father used to shout, whenever the aged philosopher appeared on the television). Oswald Mosley, in ridiculous jodhpurs and riding boots, exchanges a fascist salute with his blackshirt followers at a 1936 rally, and here’s Mosley again, rallying a postwar crowd. He’s ditched his absurd uniform of strongman leather belt and the boots by now.Mosley’s pre-war antisemitism gave way, by the 1970s, to the National Front and broader attacks on immigration and the Black and Asian population, leading to mass demonstrations and shows of revulsion against them. Sometimes resistance has to go on and on and it must never stop. An anti-fascist protester is led away after a mounted police baton charge during the Battle of Cable Street in 1936, and a week later fire runs in the gutter on another East End street.There are flashpoints and long-terms protest, hunger strikes and a picture of a “dirty protester” incarcerated in Belfast’s Maze Prison, smuggled out in 1979. We find covert police images of suffragettes, and another of them in court (the camera hidden in the photographer’s hat). The stories bolster the images and keep the whole thing alive.The exhibition and accompanying book – with numerous essays by Gary Younge, Paul Gilroy, Baroness Chakrabarti and others, and including first-hand accounts of protest movements and acts of resistance – has been several years in the making. McQueen’s highly personal introduction recounts his going to a Saturday school, one of several set up by Black families to help children who were being failed by the education system. It was here that McQueen learned to draw, and to gain confidence. Eventually he went to art school. The first demonstration he went on was against the introduction of student tuition fees in 1988. He knows he could not have gone to art school if he’d had to pay. “My own resistance started with me loving myself,” he writes. “My resistance was my courage to dare and push my ability.” Resistance is inspiring.Resistance is atTurner Contemporary, Margate, from 22 February to 1 JuneExplore more on these topicsPhotographySteve McQueenreviewsShareReuse this content"

But unlike other theatre visits, this time I was surrounded by a number of large cameras.This was not due to some crisis in audience etiquette, but because I was watching the live-capture of the onstage performance. As I was enjoying Ncuti Gatwa’s Algernon pretending to play piano in a dazzling hot-pink dress, production teams in a number of trucks outside were frantically working to ensure the performance would be optimised for cinema screens across the world.This is, of course, the great operation of National Theatre Live. The initiative launched in June 2009 with Helen Mirren’s Phèdre beamed into 70 cinemas across the UK, and has become a resounding success, now featuring in over 850 domestic cinemas and venues, and in thousands of cinemas across the globe. Last year, the theatre celebrated its 100th cinematic release with Nye starring Michael Sheen. With The Importance of Being Earnest opening in UK cinemas last night to an estimated audience of 45,000, and Dr Strangelove premiering next month, National Theatre Live has clearly become a firm fixture of the event cinema landscape.The success of the projectwas not always guaranteed. Initially, there was a lot of scepticism over whether the experience of watching theatre could truly be replicated on screen, or if the production could match up to Hollywood’s ever-advancing cinematography. But as Leo Jordan, head of marketing at the National Theatre, tells me: “Everybody who gives it a go says the same thing: that it works so amazingly. While we’re not ever saying that we’re better than going to the theatre in person, if you can’t get there it is an amazing, alternative way of watching theatre.” And National Theatre Live shows are not only aired in cinemas – they are played in village halls, community centres, and even ona mobile screen that drives around the Scottish Highlands.View image in fullscreenAndrew Scott in National Theatre Live’s Vanya.Photograph: Marc BrennerWhat is the secret behind capturing plays for the screen? Director Sam Yates, whose National Theatre Live production Vanya, a one-man adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s play Uncle Vanya starring Andrew Scott, says that the key is to “give the audience the experience of being in the best seat in the house in the theatre, but also make it stand alone as a film within its own right”. Yates is particularly keen on the use of closeup cameras to translate a stage performance to a more filmic language. He says: “I wanted a camera that would follow Andrew around on a mid [medium camera shot] so that you can capture everything in one shot, and then a camera that was an extreme closeup. So within that, we were able to create startling cinematic images, not just capture what works on the proscenium stage.”Jess Richardson, the head of production at National Theatre Live, talks about the collaborative nature of matching filming considerations with the artistic intent of the stage director. One important thing about capturing plays is that you make decisions for the audience on where they should look, unlike when they’re gazing at a large, expansive stage, where they can choose when to lock in on the action or linger on a background detail. Richardson says that “with captured theatre we’re looking at mid shots or even cowboy shots [where the subject is framed from the mid-thigh to the top of their head] and telling an audience where to look – that’s really important to make sure we’re telling the story in the same way. So where is your eye drawn to on stage? Where’s the action that the director wants you to be looking at?”Unsurprisingly, National Theatre Live is something of a mammoth operation – on a behind-the-scenes tour I’m amazed at the number of screens and buttons and codes that have to be handled during a production. But the production team have the benefit of camera rehearsals before the official live recording, which means that (touch wood) thus far they have avoided any real hiccups. National Theatre Live is also helped by the fact that, unlike in its earlier days, it is no longer aliterallive broadcast – which involves a complex operation of trucks transmitting to a satellite and then transmitting to the venues. Richardson explains: “From 2019 there was some research from our viewers that suggested that as long as they knew it had been captured live, it didn’t necessarily have tobelive. What they enjoyed was that it wasn’t four shows pieced together – it was one night captured.” Truly live broadcast releases are therefore now a rarity.Nearly 16 years on, now an international success, how will National Theatre Live innovate further? It has already startedputting productions on streaming servicessince experimenting with digital releases during the pandemic, and is now looking at other technology. AI is (understandably) a dirty word in entertainment these days but is nonetheless proving to be of invaluable assistance in the creation of smooth live productions.As Richardson says: “You’ve seen in films and Hollywood where AI is being used to replace voices or improve accents – that’s not a world for us. But when it comes to sound mixes and recordings there’s so many AI programmes and softwares that can improve sound quality. How that will come to benefit more areas will remain to be seen over the next few years.” In any case, this revolution in event cinema has expanded the reach of British theatre across the globe (a recent Spanish-subtitled run of Vanya in Mexico hasadded new dates due to demand). Perhaps theatre is becoming an important feature of British soft power.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are used to increasingly long gaps between their release, but with no new lead actor in sight, Bond 26 has still not even reached the starting gate. Eon kept the quest for a new Bond behind completely closed doors, like a sort of state secret, but Bezos’s first act has been to throw the gates open, with an Elon Musk-esque act of quasi-crowdsourcing. It may be just a PR-grabbing gesture, but it demonstrates that Amazon is planning to do things differently from now on.View image in fullscreenPassing the baton … Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli in 2024.Photograph: Valérie Macon/AFP/Getty ImagesThe focus, understandably, is how Amazon might develop the franchise. Eon’s method has been to protect the brand like hawks, pouring all their efforts into one huge film, and refusing all suggestions of spin-offs, adaptations, remakes. And it worked: every Bond film has been a box office giant, meaning that this 60-year-old spy-movie series is still bigger than Batman, Lord of the Rings or X-Men. (The only time Broccoli and Wilson caved in to the pressure of a TV spin-off wasAmazon’s poorly recieved challenge show 007: Road to a Million, which they presumably felt was far enough removed from the core Bond purpose that it couldn’t really dilute it.) Amazon will be undoubtedly looking to other mainstream “cinematic universes” as a model, and seeking to imitate Star Wars and Marvel’s mix of “main narrative” feature films, standalone spin-off films (Moneypenny: The Early Years and the like), and streaming shows (Rosa Klebb’s Adventures in Space/Time, with any luck) to extend the reach of the storylines.Of course, picking a new Bond is vital, and who Amazon settles on will determine the nature of what follows. Eon, to outsiders, seemed caught between keeping the traditional audience on side by picking someone not dissimilar to previous incumbents (ie British, white, male, in early middle age) and following its own liberal instincts by installing an actor outside that demographic (towards which they made a tentative move giving Lashana Lynch a role as 007 in No Time to Die). Idris Elbafor years was touted as a possible replacementbut, as the actor himself said in the past, the blunt truth is that, at 52, he is probably to be too old.The bookies’ choicesare more traditional: Happy Valley’s James Norton, Aaron Taylor Johnson (Kick-Ass, Kraven the Hunter, Nocturnal Animals etc), and Babygirl’s Harris Dickinson. Will Bezos go down the progressive route? In the current political climate it’s – frankly – become much less likely.View image in fullscreenJames Norton, pictured at last week’s Baftas, is one of the bookies’ favourites for the next Bond.Photograph: Joe Maher/Getty Images for BaftaHowever, Amazon’s first order of business isn’t casting; it’ll have to appoint an executive (or team) to supervise the franchise. (Experience has shown that even the biggest movie operations need focused figureheads to run things, a la Kevin Feige at Marvel, Kathleen Kennedy at Star Wars, and James Gunn and Peter Safran for DC.) What Amazon is really after, in common with the other standalone giants Netflix and Apple, is to crack the blockbuster movie business, something that for all its prowess in delivering product, it has never really managed – in sharp contrast to the streamer’s conquest of high-end TV. All the while the established Hollywood studios, led by Disney and Warner Bros, have used their film-making prowess to make inroads into the streamers’ core business, using their own bespoke players (Disney+ and Max respectively). Purchasing expensive IP, as Disney did with Star Wars and Marvel, as Netflix did with Narnia and Amazon itself with Tolkien, is the main weapon.Bezos’s first act has been to throw the gates openThe way Bond films are financed will probably change also. Eon wasthe master of the brand partnership, with which it accrued vast amounts of production funding: leaked emails revealed that Heineken paid £28m to be involved in Skyfall; in return,they got Craig for a huge global advertising campaign. With less need to focus on individual films’ finances, Amazon may feel less obliged to continue Bond’s brand-stuffed aesthetic, and may feel less inclined to cast a lead who looks good holding a beer can. But it remains to be seen how far Amazon will go in developing Bond as a “universe”; Eon made its own tentative attempts to establish a set of potential spin-off villains in Spectre, but appeared to retreat from that back to winding up Bond’s personal narrative in No Time to Die. There is a finite amount of original Bond material to draw on, however, and that point seemed to be reached several movies back, with Quantum of Solace the most recent title actually taken from a Fleming story. (All practical possibilities seem to have been exhausted; we’re never likely to see films called The Hildebrand Rarity or Risico.)The timing of the deal means that Broccoli and Wilson have chosen to bow out as the series is at a crossroads; decisions made now will affect it for years. Having shepherded Bond together since 1995, the half-brother and sister team have overseen two major transformations (to Pierce Brosnan, and then Craig) and can look back with complete satisfaction. The keys to the Bond kingdom are now entirely in Amazon’s hands.Explore more on these topicsFilmJames BondAmazon Prime VideoAction and adventure filmsanalysisShareReuse this content"

But all too often, our pillows let us down. I can’t be the only person to have bought a comfy-feeling pillow from a reputable brand only to feel it becoming increasingly flat or lumpy with time, or after putting it through the wash.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Synthetic pillows are touted as a squishy yet supportive alternative to traditional feather and down pillows, and they’re versatile and easy to clean. Plus, they’re a great option for people with asthma, or dust and feather allergies, like me.From hollow, micro- or ball-fibre polyester to cubes or shreds of foam, the choice of synthetic fillings is greater than ever. Some are biodegradable, potentially reducing their environmental impact when they reach the end of their useful lives, and luxury options are equipped with antibacterial or cooling covers, or air vents to reduce overheating. But which pillow is best?In recent years, I’ve become obsessed with trying to find a synthetic pillow that will retain its plumpness night after night, without being so plump that it feels too firm to sleep on or my neck cricks. I regularly unsheathe hotel pillows to learn which brands or materials they use, but with so many options available, I wanted to conduct a more comprehensive test to find the best synthetic pillows available.The best bedding brands interior designers use at home, from luxury linen to cool cottonRead moreAt a glanceBest synthetic pillow overall:Brightr Nox vegan down pillow£79.99 at Brightr SleepBest pillow for side sleepers:Hanse Select feather-free pillowFrom €99 (about £82) at HanseBest pillow for back sleepers:Richard Haworth Soft micro-down hypoallergenic pillow£26.36 at Richard HaworthWhy you should trust meI am the author of abook on circadian rhythms and sleep, and a science journalist who’s scrutinised health and science claims, separating the facts from marketing hype, for two decades. I also love my sleep and need at least seven-and-a-half hours a night to function the next day, so having a supportive pillow is very important to me.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘We put our shortlisted options through a pillow fight.’Photograph: Linda Geddes/The GuardianMy family and I cosied up with 17 different synthetic pillows to assess their comfort and durability. Despite having different sleeping styles and body shapes, we found a surprising amount of common ground in our shortlisted favourites.Comfort was the biggest factor. Each pillow was initially scored out of 10, and the average was used to identify the five pillows preferred by side sleepers and the five favoured by the back sleepers in our family. We then spent at least three nights sleeping on each shortlisted pillow – or more, if we fell in love with them. After the sleep test, our shortlisted pillows were rated again.Washability was another factor. All shortlisted pillows were taken to a launderette and put through a washing machine, before being tumble-dried following the manufacturers’ instructions. Only pillows that could be washed – or had a padded outer cover that could be washed – and dried without losing their shape and comfort made it on to our recommended list.Since pillows must be durable enough to withstand being squashed, plumped and shaken in and out of pillowcases, we also put each shortlisted option through a pillow fight, to ensure they retained their shape and showed no signs of falling apart. Although the focus of this review was synthetic pillows, rather than those containing natural fibre fillings, bonus points were awarded for the use of sustainable or biodegradable materials in their construction. Finally, because no pillow is perfect for everyone, we favoured products with a right-of-return policy.The best anti-allergy pillows in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Linda Geddes/The GuardianBest synthetic pillow overall:Brightr Nox vegan down pillowView image in fullscreenThis pillow was lauded by side and back sleepers alike, due to its adjustability and squishy, down-like comfort. Its design is unusual, consisting of a padded outer case that can be filled with different combinations of medium- and low-loft inserts. There’s even an extra bag of microfibre stuffing that can be added via a zipper to the medium-loft layer for further customisation. Some side sleepers liked it with both inserts, others with just the medium-loft one, while our back sleeper preferred the low-loft insert. The heft of the fully stuffed pillow also proved a formidable weapon in our pillow fight.Another interesting feature is the weaving of copper fibres into the cover to fight bacteria, viruses and allergens. Although Brightr doesn’t specify which allergens this targets, independentstudies have suggested the viability of dust mites may be reduced by copper. It also hasantimicrobial and antifungal properties, so such claims are plausible, even though we didn’t test them ourselves.Care should be taken when laundering this pillow. Although Brightr claimed it was fully washable, ours went a bit lumpy after the first wash and tumble dry. Upon rereading the care instructions, we tried putting it back into the tumble dryer with a tennis ball, which restored its former fluffiness.It’s a shame that …while spare copper-infused pillowcases can be bought, these aren’t padded like the original. This means that any unused inserts can’t be repurposed into a second pillow and are therefore wasted.Height:variable, adjustable; 22cm when fully stuffedSupport:adjustable from very firm to soft.

The filling is composed of polyfibre “pearls” (polyester fibres rolled into small fluffy balls that glide over one another, making the pillow easy to plump).Hanse is also about to launch a biodegradable option: the same pillow, except the filling has been treated with enzymes designed to gradually break down the material when it is exposed to soil, moisture and warmth. Fortunately, this doesn’t happen during regular machine washing. We tested both the standard and biodegradable pillows and our side sleepers found them impressively comfortable, although they were too plump for our back sleeper. A firm versionis also available, which we didn’t test – it’s labelled “fest”via this link, whereas the soft version we tested is labelled “weich”.It’s a shame that …the height of this pillow isn’t adjustable, as some others are.Height:18cmSupport: soft (weich) or firm (fest)Filling:100% polyfibreWashability:fully washableAllergy claims:feather-free and suitable for house dust allergy sufferers.Oeko-Texcertified harmless to healthSustainability:a biodegradable version is expected to launch shortlyReturns/guarantee if bought direct from brand:14-day risk-free right of return, two-year manufacturing quality guaranteeFrom €99 (about £82) at HanseBest pillow for back sleepers:Richard Haworth Soft micro-down hypo-allergenic pillowView image in fullscreenI first encountered Richard Haworth pillows at a friend’s ski chalet, where I was so impressed that I pulled off the pillowcases to inspect the labels. Although my friend had boughtthe brand’s Clusterfill pillows– which we also tested and would recommend for side sleepers – it was the softer micro-down pillow that our back sleeper rated as his joint favourite (alongside the Brightr pillow). These were also some of the cheapest pillows that we tested.Since the company primarily serves the hotel industry, you’d expect its pillows to survive rough handling and a wash cycle unscathed, which they did. And though soft, they still felt supportive and bounced back into shape after being slept on.Amarginally plumper standard versionof this pillow is also available, which our side sleepers favoured.It’s a shame that …these pillows could be more sustainable, even though Richard Haworth is a member of theBetter Cotton Initiative.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The “hybrid” label stems from its filling: cubes of open-cell foam, which provide the mouldable cushioning of memory foam pillows, with the feel of a more traditional pillow. Opinions were split over its comfort: some of our side sleepers loved it, others found it a little on the soft side. The amount of filling can easily be reduced via a handy zipper, lowering its height, although our back sleeper then found it a little “lumpy”.The pillow’s padded, outer jacket has Stratos “cool-touch” tech woven in, which means the surface feels cool, while mesh panels in the sides help to dissipate moisture and heat. Overheating can be a problem with solid memory foam pillows, but our testers didn’t report any issues with this. The foam cubes can’t be washed, but the padded outer jacket can, and the pillow’s comfort was unaffected by doing so. The cover also dried quickly, without the need for a tumble dryer, which was another benefit.It didn’t make the final cut because …my side-sleeper children found it too soft, and my back-sleeper husband too firm, even though I loved sleeping on this pillow.Extra filling can be bought from Simba’s Amazon store, which may benefit side sleepers who prefer a loftier pillow, although we didn’t try this.Height:adjustable; 18cm when fully stuffed;support:medium firm to soft;filling:quilted outer cover filled with polyester fibres, inner core of foam nanocubes;washability:padded cover washable, foam core not washable;allergy claims:hypoallergenic outer cover.

Like the Brightr pillow, they’re filled with very fine denier polyester “microfibres”, providing a squishy, down-like experience, yet they’re still plump enough to provide the support side sleepers need to keep their necks and spines aligned. They’re also surprisingly weighty, making them feel more like a traditional feather pillow – and were excellent weapons in our pillow fights.We liked the medium-firm pillow, but soft-medium and extra-firm options are also available.It didn’t make the final cut because …our back sleeper did not like this pillow, although our side sleepers did.

It’s what you do with that feeling that mattersJulieanne SmolinskiFri 21 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTShareAcouple of years ago, I decided to go for more “achievable” new year resolutions: challenging and life-enhancing but also small to the point of near-stupidity. For example, near the end of last year, I decided I would stop using my car’s horn in non-life-threatening situations.If you’re wondering what kind of asshole uses the horn in non-life-threatening situations, I know it’s noise pollution, and childish, and rude.On any given day, I range from “grouchy dad in a movie set in the 1950s” to “PMDD Jerry Seinfeld”. You know: “When did they start putting these dumb adhesive bands on bananas? They come naturally bunched!”, et cetera. And for whatever reason, I’m at my worst in the car. When I’m overwrought, I don’t scream at my kids or pick fights with my husband – that all gets saved for the car, when I’m by myself, with no one else to hear me but God and my upholstery. I get disproportionately angry with strangers who are texting when they should be realizing that the light is green. So I take my very dumb revenge via honk.When I shared this with a therapist I was seeing at the time, she offered a number of “helpful suggestions”. (I’d recently made the switch from a tough-love therapist to the kind who just sides with you on everything for an extra $150.) Her suggestions were based on actual anger management guidance for people even more irritable than I am, people who have been brought up on charges for real-deal rage incidents. One strategy is – seriously – saying the words “beep beep” instead of using your horn. Another is trying to express your feelings without involving or engaging the other person (for example, yelling “I am upset that you didn’t use your turn signal, because I am late for work!” to yourself, instead of at someone who might get out of their car and slap you).I appreciate these non-violent solutions, yet I also must urge you to picture the angriest person you know – like, I don’t know, my cousin who got reprimanded at his UPS delivery job for listening to Korn too loudly. Imagine them gently shouting “beep beep” to themselves after almost being T-boned by a twentysomething who zoned out while trying to open a third Celsius in a Dodge Challenger. You can see how, in addition to being a little silly, it might not give the user the same sense of satisfaction upon deployment.Not long after I received that therapist’s advice and totally failed to apply it, something exciting happened.I was en route to school with my kids, late as usual and stuck on a narrow stretch of Franklin Avenue in Hollywood (one that half of LA seems to need to pass through at the busiest time of the morning), when a private waste management truck parked at a 45-degree angle in the center of the road. Two gentlemen in coveralls leisurely exited the truck and began dragging an enormous dumpster from the parking lot of a nearby shopping center, so that they might empty it into their trash truck.When I say “leisurely”, I mean so jolly and unhurried they seemed as if they were in some kind of ambulatory book club, just dying to talk aboutAll Foursover a couple of canned rosés, rather than two idiots blithely blocking both lanes of rush-hour traffic.I could actually see the people in the cars around me going from the usual city-dweller “Can you believe this?” to throwing up their hands in despair and shaking them, like actors in a local production of Les Misérables.Two full cycles of the stoplight passed without traffic moving in either direction, as our unbothered heroes wheeled the dumpster in a zig-zag pattern around the shopping center parking lot, still chatting amiably about, I don’t know, the latest season of the The Morning Show.Here’s where things got good: the door to a dingy little white hatchback a few cars ahead of me opened up, and out popped a muscly short guy. And he was mad.You may not have seen this particular guy before, but you’ve seen a “this guy” before. You know: the type who looks like he’s sculpted out of ground turkey, or has a bad photorealistic tattoo of a toddler on his forearm. The type who gets into it with the hostess at Outback Steakhouse because he saw an elderly couple who came in after him get seated first. The type of guy who wears tank tops in winter, because he’s built like a shaved Lorax on human growth hormone.This guy yelled something at the two waste disposal gentlemen. When they didn’t respond, he spun around with great purpose, heading for his trunk.My kids leaned forward in their car seats (they’re five, six and seven – ages pediatricians frequently cite as a child’s most bloodlustful). I could see other stuck drivers doing the same, although with a little more concern about whether actual violence might be about to unfold. I could tell we were all picturing being on that evening’s edition of KTLA news, wearing a bewildered expression as we told a Juvédermed anchor named Kirk what happened.There was a collective clench as the guy’s beefy little torso disappeared into his tiny car, where he rooted around angrily for something. We looked from him back to the two oblivious dumpster wranglers, who seemed to be moving with even less urgency than before, pushing the big container on to the truck’s hydraulic lift as if it were a toddler in a baby swing. All despite the fact that they were maybe about to be publicly super-murdered.A tense moment later, the muscly guy emerged holding an absolutely enormous bullhorn.Well, now we could all relax. Then the real fun started.“ATTENTION JERKOFFS! MOVE YOUR FUCKIN’ TRUCK! I’M TALKING TO YOU, PIN DICKS!

Maybe he had a bullhorn just so he could yell at people in traffic. It didn’t matter. He said “assholes” like it was two separate words, and he said it loud. This went on for some time; in a true feat of poetry, or improvisation, he never repeated the same florid insult twice.Oh, no! It takes 162,335 minutes a year to maintain my health and wellbeingRead moreEverybody started applauding and hooting. And honking, but in that fun, jovial way that happens when your team wins the World Series. The garbage twins seemed to notice us all for the first time, and more importantly, they began to hustle. That small angry hotdog of a man had performed an everyday, big city miracle: the men moved their garbage truck, the cars advanced, and my children made it to school armed with several brand new words.As for me, I hadn’t been cheering as loud as everybody else – definitely not as loud as my five-year-old, who was still holding out hope that somebody might get a good whack with the bullhorn. I was busy worrying, fretting, being afraid of anger. From the bullhorn guy, from everybody in the other cars, but also from me.I want to be the kind of citizen and mother who keeps a cool head, who can stay grounded and helpful through the inconvenient and the scary and the infuriating. I wish I was a person with great reserves of fortitude and patience, who stabilizes and comforts other people in times when we’re all frightened, inconvenienced and furious. We need those people, the peaceful ones who wait for things to pass and know that they will. I wish I was, but I’m afraid I’m not.Shortly after the dumpster excitement, I went back to my “tough love” therapist, who told me that my nice therapist had given me dumb advice. This therapist-on-therapist beef alone was worth the price of eating two copays. But my tough-love therapist said that as long as I wasn’t hurting anybody, it was fine to be angry. Normal, even. “Better to punch a pillow than kick the dog,” she said.My tough-love therapist said that as long as I wasn’t hurting anybody, it was fine to be angry. Normal, evenTrying to not be angry was impossible – it’s what you do with the feeling that matters. This applies equally to sitting in traffic, getting cut in line for an oil change, or watching the world you wanted for your kids fall irrevocably apart, day after day after day.That rage, she said, is not unique to me or to the particular time and place in which we’re living. We have jobs to do, people to raise – and the worst thing you could do is let the worst feeling become the guiding principle of your short time here. You could certainly honk, or make the choice to start carrying a bullhorn in your car. Or you could realize that new challenges require new coping strategies that don’t involve the daily venting of our rage in front of our children. While admittedly fun, it’s just not a sustainable way to live if you don’t want to end up in a trembling fetal position under your duvet every night, or, perhaps, in a glassy-eyed mugshot on the evening news.

They divorced when I was six, and I grew up living with my dad in the shipyard in the Netherlands where he worked.I started planning my trip around the world at the age of eight after reading the American sailor Tania Aebi’s memoir, Maiden Voyage. I began saving and sailing as much as possible to make that dream a reality. I was a confident sailor: at 13, I crossed the Channel solo. I didn’t tell my parents before I left; I didn’t think they’d say yes.Then I started seriously thinking about sailing around the world. My parents weren’t thrilled with the idea, but after talking to them about it, they became supportive – they knew I’d do it anyway, and thought it would be better to make it as safe as possible.After learning of my plans, social services got involved to take away my dad’s custody and prevent my voyage. It becamea controversial news story. It was worse than any storm I’ve faced – people left comments online saying: “I hope you die.” It was a real shock.After eight court cases, my dad got custody back. Soon after, at 14, I set off on my 38ft sailboat, Guppy, in August 2010. My dad sailed with me from the Netherlands to Gibraltar – that way we could test the boat together and make sure I had her well under control.As I set off from Gibraltar on my own, my emotions were one big jumble. I felt on top of the world and at the same time so nervous I couldn’t sleep for the first few days.I was never really afraid: I had done a lot of training with my dad to keep my emotions under controlSpotting my first destination on the horizon – the Canary Islands – felt amazing. I knew then I’d keep going: across the Atlantic and the Pacific, through the Torres Strait on to the Indian Ocean, around South Africa and on to my finish line, Sint Maarten in the Caribbean.Things weren’t always easy. Crossing the North Atlantic, there were periods of no wind but also big swells – waves coming from a distance – so I was rolling back and forth, my sails tearing apart. I also had to dodge reefs and ships. The longest I slept at sea was 50 minutes at a time. Your body adjusts. I was never really afraid: I had trained with my dad to keep my emotions under control.I completed my education through distance learning. Over the course of the voyage, I made more than 20 stops. Sometimes I stayed just a day or two; rarely, I’d stay for a couple of weeks if my boat needed repairs. For money, I worked odd jobs along the way.At sea I washed with saltwater, and cleaned my clothes with fresh water ashore. Rain was my best friend – it meant free laundry and showering. For fun, I’d play guitar, read and write. I didn’t really get lonely, even though I was only with other people when I was invited to dinner on their boats, or went ashore. During stops, I’d take my laptop to a cafe, Skype with my family and update my blog about my voyage. I had a long-distance radio so I could send messages to my dad while I was at sea.View image in fullscreenDekker, who now runs a sailing foundation for teenagers.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianI’m not much of a cook, and one of the toughest things about the journey was the food. I ended up eating a lot of pasta, rice, canned food and pancakes – before finding out, three months in, that one really needs veggies. One of my favourite places was French Polynesia. It’s beautiful, with big mountains, blue water, coral reefs and a community-oriented culture.

But don’t let that put you off; in fact, I found the jeopardy rather exciting.Stark by Ben and Sophie Crittenden is the latest reprise of the pair’s former12-seater in Broadstairs, Kent. The couple, seeking a better work/life balance, upped sticks here to the Côte d’Azur of Colchester, to open this brand-new Stark, which has slightly more covers (20 or so) and is, frankly, about as “independent” as a restaurant can get. We made the trek one Saturday evening, and were originally booked in for 6pm, until the Crittendens called to ask if we’d not prefer to eat later, because we’d be dining alone, a sweet attention to detail that only small operations such as this have time to pick up on (see alsothe Troublesome Lodgerin Marlow).Stark’s premises are delightfully homespun, and err on the side of a glorified timber gazebo. There is no reception desk or cloakroom, no art installations, wine cave, private dining mezzanine or other such frippery. And at the back of this prettified shed, chef Ben works solo as an army of one. No sous chef, chef de partie, patissier et al: just a man and his pans, serving six courses methodically. He used to work at Michelin-starredthe West Housein Kent and competed on MasterChef: The Professionals in 2014 before opening the Broadstairs incarnation of Stark, which itself quickly gained a Michelin star; just last week, this Mersea Island manifestation retained that star.View image in fullscreen‘Perfectly judged’: Stark’s cod with mussels and mushrooms.Expect the likes of pungent, earthy duck liver parfait served in a neat quenelle on a blob of rich onion marmalade, or a bowl of perfectly judged cod with mussels, or sea bass on a perch of caramelised fennel with a dainty prawn toast. Stark’s greeter, server, sommelier and occasional kitchen porter is Ben’s partner, Sophie, a calming, ebullient presence who you’d want on your side during a minor land battle. “Are you warm enough?” she asked as we settled in. Most restaurants in winter wouldn’t care if you ate in a bobble hat.The menu changes frequently, of course – you can do that when you’re a one-man band – and has in the past featuredshh’annu lambwith aubergine, and seared duck breast with apple and hazelnut. Some will cough that these dishes are more like mouthfuls, but even the most faff-phobic diner would find it hard to quibble with a sublime portion of medium-rare Scottish beef fillet on a rich jus with a single yet exemplary confit potato and a neat blob of whipped horseradish.A bowl of whipped goat’s curd appears towards the end of dinner – but is it pudding or another savoury course? Who can tell? It’s cheesy, certainly whiffy, with layers of thinly sliced grape, micro herbs, pistachio cake and chopped pistachio. It’s also quite unlike anything I’ve ever been served.View image in fullscreen‘Pungent and earthy’: Stark’s duck liver parfait.Crittenden makes fine produce the star of his show, then plates it up in curious, delicate, punchily flavoured pieces of art. There is a wine pairing for an extra £55 a head of French, Italian and Austrian wines. A grüner veltliner to match with the cod dish and a pale, sticky moscato to go with an artichoke and chocolate dessert. After a trying experience with an artichoke millefeuille, Charles has a vehement dislike of the annual winter “artichoke as pudding” season, but I adored this bowl of chocolate creme with candied artichoke, praline truffle and a scattering of chopped hazelnut. That was our final course of six, which we’d whistled through in about 90 minutes.The place was by this point full of Mersea Island’s great and good, many of whom were tackling the wine flight like troupers. “I bet the gossip that goes down in here is terrific,” I said to Charles.View image in fullscreen‘Dainty’: Stark’s sea bass with caramelised fennel and prawn toast.Stark is a gem. Some will scoff at its lack of airs and graces, at its minute team and at the fact that it’s a bit like eating in a summer house. But this very much feels like a restaurant opened on the Crittendens’ terms, in pursuit of that quasi-fantastical dream harboured by many hospitality veterans: how about if we opened a tiny place, and took away all those fussy, stressful bits of restaurateuring such as staffing, posh fit-outs and lengthy menus? Those things still feel necessary to climb ladders and grace fancy lists drawn up by tyre companies, but they can also turn a restaurant into a behemoth that gobbles up lives and turns the owner’s children into strangers. Stark is a lesson in simplicity. Check the tides, take an open mind and give it a go.StarkEast Road, East Mersea, near Colchester, Essex, 01206 616430 or starkmersea@gmail.com.

Much Ado About Nothing may be more than 400 years old but Jamie Lloyd’scurrent spin in London’s West Endplants it very much in the modern day. Key to its contemporary update? The costumes, which look as if they have been plucked straight from a Hollywood red carpet.View image in fullscreenHarry Styles is among the male stars who have embraced jewellery.Photograph: Ian West/PARecently, menswear has been leaning into a new fun fashion era. Bland black tuxes are out. In their place? Everything from sheer chiffon shirts to sparkly jewellery. Greta Gerwig’s box office-breaking Barbie film, in which Ryan Gosling leaned into his himbo character Ken on and off-screen, may be approaching its two-year anniversary but its impact is still reverberating in menswear. No one, fromthe 72-year-old Jeff Goldblumto gen Z’s Timothée Chalamet, can resist. Even atthis year’s Bafta awards, usually a more restrained carpet, a dazzling brooch was a menswear staple.And now the Kenification effect has come to theatreland.Soutra Gilmour, the costume and set designer for Much Ado About Nothing, which is atTheatreRoyal Drury Lane, says she started by looking at how menswear has evolved over the past couple of years. “It’s moved away from those massive oversized shapes and instead has become more conscious of the body,” she says. “The fabrics and textures have also been elevated.”Bridget Escolme, the author of Shakespeare and Costume in Practice and a professor of theatre and performance at Queen Mary University ofLondon, says evidence suggests that Shakespeare’s original audiences would have seen its actors also “dressed in the fashions of the day”.Gilmour began by getting the cast to try on different types of clothing. “On stage, you’re not actually looking at the clothes,” shesays. “You are looking at the person. Their body is a tool so you need to clothe them in a way that elevates rather than obliterates them.”View image in fullscreenGerald Kyd as Don Pedro (second left) has a hot pink look in Much Ado About Nothing.Photograph: Marc BrennerGilmour andTom Hiddleston(who plays Benedick) decided on the character’s navy silk shirt and matching knife-pleated trousers because they look “like a second skin”. Gilmour adds: “This sculpts his body while still allowing him to move.”The shirt’s giant lapels were chosen to draw attention to his face. But it is the shimmering belt added to give the look “more of a fever dream quality” that steals the spotlight as he shimmies and body rolls across the stage. Hiddleston leans into the peacock aesthetic, flashing his abs as he proclaims”: “I am loved of all ladies.”Gilmour also wanted to challenge the norms of gender conformity. “I didn’t want to get too bogged down in whether people were wearing male or female clothes,” she says. “It’s something I’ve been doing for a long time. And it’s a constant conversation, thinking about masculinity and femininity and what those terms actually mean.”The result? King Don Pedro (played by Gerald Kyd) wears a hot pink look including a silk blouse unbuttoned to the navel. The antagonist Don John (Tim Steed) plots Hero’s (Mara Huf) downfall in florals and pearls and at one stage the cunning Borachio (Mika Onyx Johnson) appears in a full-length flamingo pink faux fur coat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Beatrice (Hayley Atwell) and Hero wear towering shoes while Beatrice’s jumpsuit has oversized shoulder pads.“I wanted the women to physically take up space. I think it’s interesting to soften the men’s presence and define and raise the women’s physical presence,” says Gilmour.Part of Shakespeare’s enduring appeal is his modern thinking, she adds. “Four-hundred years later it still feels relevant.

However, I’ve decided to break the rules and go in a different direction with a nutty, buttery filling that feels reminiscent of a florentine. I think these fit the bill for a good Sunday lunch pudding, too. Serve warm and still a little gooey with some cold cream.Honey nut galettesPrep10 minChill1 hr 20 minCook1 hr 15 minMakes4For the pastry180gplain flour,plus extra for dusting130g unsalted butter20g caster sugarSaltEgg wash2 tbspdemerara sugarCold cream,to serveFor the filling100g honey30g unsalted butter30g light brown sugar60ml double cream½ tsp flaky sea salt1 egg yolk10g plain flour100g toasted flaked almondsTo make the pastry, put the flour, butter, sugar and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Use your fingertips to rub in the butter until you have a coarse mixture with small, slightly uneven chunks of butter in it. Make a well in the centre, pour in 35-40ml cold water, then use a table knife to bring the mix together into a dough. Pat it into a disc, wrap in clingfilm and chill for at least an hour.For the filling, put the honey, butter, sugar, double cream and salt in a small saucepan, and heat gently until melted and smooth. Take off the heat and leave it to cool a little.Whisk in the egg yolk and flour, then tip in the flaked almonds, stirring to make sure everything is well coated.Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/400F/gas 6½. Cut the chilled pastry into four, then roll out each piece on a lightly floured surface into a disc about 5mm thick. Spoon some of the filling on top, leaving a border around the edge, and fold the edges of the pastry up and over the filling. Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling.Transfer the galettes to a lined baking tray and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes. Brush with egg wash, sprinkle with demerara sugar, then bake for 10 minutes. Turn down the oven temperature to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and bake for a further 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is browned.

Yet while Sheinbaum has made some concessions, she has also charmed Trump and won plaudits at home, with approval ratingsthat touch 80%.“Sheinbaum has kept a cool head, and the capacity to hold firm and react to Trump,” said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political scientist. “ButMexicois in a situation of emergency with the US. And it will have to play this game for four years straight.”Mexico will not stand US ‘invasion’ in fight against cartels, president saysRead moreSheinbaum led Morena, a leftwing populist party, to a landslide victory in June last year, and had barely taken power when Trump won re-election in November.Many wondered how Sheinbaum, a climate scientist before she became a politician, would handle the US president. But the two have struck up a relationship, with Trump describing Sheinbaum as a “marvellous woman” even as he claims Mexico is “essentially run by cartels”.Since Trump announced a plan to hit all goods imported from Mexico with a25% tariff, citing its alleged failure to stop migrants and fentanyl entering the US, Sheinbaum has offered to negotiate, while avoiding gestures of obeisance – such as Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau’strip to Mar-a-Lago– or defiance – like Colombian president Gustavo Petro’stirade against Trump on X.Sheinbaum has also shown a willingness to do more on fentanyl, with Mexican security forcesnotching a record seizurejust days after Trump’s announcement, and underlined that Mexico was already doing a great deal tokeep migrants away from the US-Mexico border.View image in fullscreenMexican national guard officers at the border.Photograph: Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty ImagesAt the same time, she picked battles that allowed her to show strength to a domestic audience while avoiding direct confrontation with Trump himself – for example, threatening Google with a lawsuit after it bowed to Trump and renamed international waters in theGulf of Mexico as the Gulf of Americaon Google Maps.She has pledged to expandlegal actionagainst US gun manufacturers who produce the majority of weapons used in Mexico, and implicitly turned Trump’s rhetoric on its head by warning that her countrywould not tolerate an “invasion” of its national sovereignty by US forces.“Sheinbaum found the sweet spot between the submission of Trudeau and the bravado of Petro,” said Pérez Ricart.The first real crunch came earlier this month, as the deadline for Trump’s tariff threat loomed.Sheinbaum was poised to announce retaliatory measures when last-minute talks defused the situation, with Trumpagreeing to delaythe tariffs for a month in exchange for Mexico sending 10,000 more soldiers to the border.It is unclear how those extra soldiers will reduce the flow of fentanyl, a substance so potent that only relatively small volumes are moved, andthe great majority of whichis trafficked through ports of entry by US citizens.“What I see is a show for the Mexican and American publics,” said Martha Bárcena, a former Mexican ambassador to the US. “It’s clear that Trump is talking to his base and Sheinbaum to hers. But we don’t know what is happening in the conversations between them.”“The president bought time – but the negotiation is not over,” Bárcena added.The next deadline, on 4 March, for Trump’s tariffs will likely bring another round of feverish talks, as Mexico tries to convince the US of results made on fentanyl and migration.“But if we don’t know what they want or how they want to measure it, then Trump can keep threatening us from here to the end of his government,” said Bárcena.The US has also ratcheted up the pressure by adding six Mexican organised crime groups – including the Jalisco New Generation and Sinaloa cartels, two of the world’s biggest drug trafficking organisations – toits list of foreign terrorist organisations(FTOs).While the designation of cartels as FTOs itself does not authorise US military action in Mexico, some fear it is a first step towards it.Mexico threatens to escalate US gunmakers lawsuit with terror chargesRead moreDefense secretary Pete Hegseth recently said “all options will be on the table” when it comes to dealing with the cartels. “Ultimately, we will hold nothing back to secure the American people,” he added.Meanwhile, Mexico’s economy edges towards recession. The mere threat of tariffs has already helped dragged growth projections down, with Mexico’s central bank predicting0.6% GDP growth for 2025.That makes staving off tariffs and holding the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement together only more important for Sheinbaum.“For 30 years, Mexico anchored itself to a policy of trade and development in North America. It bet its growth, its identity, on integration into North America,” said Pérez Ricart. “And now this idea is being challenged. Trump doesn’t believe in it. This is a very delicate situation for Sheinbaum, and for the country.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoUS politicsDonald TrumpUS foreign policyAmericasUS-Mexico borderClaudia SheinbaumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As its organizers confront another four years of Trump’s leadership, they are stretching beyond party lines with speakers such as the billionaire Mark Cuban and Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, to craft their vision for a new approach toUS politics.That vision looks quite different than it did six years ago, when the conservative attorney Heath Mayo founded Principles First. At the time, Mayo, formerly a rank-and-file Republican who supported the presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio, hoped to present an anti-Trump alternative to fellow conservatives.“It started as disgruntledRepublicansand conservatives, but that was back in 2019 when that objective seemed to be perhaps more realistic or people were holding out hope that the party would come to its senses,” Mayo said. “Over the years, it’s grown.”‘I feel betrayed’: federal health workers fired by Trump tell of ‘nightmare’Read moreThe group’s first summit attracted just a couple of hundred attenders in 2020, but the guest count at this year’s sold-out event has increased to about 1,100.“We’ve been surprised actually with the number of people that have signed up to come,” Mayo said. “I think it’s this hunger for new spaces in our politics – new ideas, new faces.”Those new faces include Cuban, who plans to address the summit on Saturday as his name has been floated as a potential presidential candidate in 2028. A vocal supporter of Kamala Harris’s campaign for the White House last year, Cuban might seem like an unorthodox choice for a presidential candidate, as he has never served in public office, but the same was said of Trump 10 years ago.“Clearly we live in a moment of disruption. Things are changing really fast …Democratsmay have learned that lesson the hard way in November,” Mayo said. “That’s what I hope the weekend will be – a time for people to set aside the party labels and really ask where we’re going as a country.”The summit’s list of speakers reflects that mission, ranging from John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, to Polis, the Colorado governor who has occasionallyclashedwith fellow Democrats over how to navigate the new Trump era. Other speakers include Chris Christie, the former Republican governor of New Jersey who has become a fierce critic of Trump, and four of the police officers who responded to the Capitol on 6 January 2021, as a group of the president’s supporters attempted to disrupt the congressional certification of Joe Biden’s electoral victory.View image in fullscreenMark Cuban answers questions during a small business town hall as part of the Harris-Walz campaign on 31 October 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“I feel like character and integrity are two non-negotiable, key components of Principles First,” said Rich Logis, founder of a group called Leaving Maga and a speaker at the summit. “If you look at the attendees, it’s a large, diverse swath of authors, thinkers and former elected officials. It doesn’t skew rightwing. It doesn’t skew leftwing. But what they all share in common is that they’re devoted to truth, democracy, liberal democracy and the rule of law.”Kyle Sweetser, another speaker at the summit and a former Trump supporter whovoted for Harrisin November, hopes that the event can offer an example of productive political discourse to fellow voters.“I think it’s more crucial than ever to offer some sort of platform, at least to reaffirm our commitment to core democratic values and principles,” Sweetser said. “And I’m really looking forward to some good discussion and hopefully some exchange of ideas that will strengthen our democracy.”Sweetser knows firsthand how difficult it can be to reach Trump supporters who have embraced the Maga movement. He voted for Trump twice before starting to question that loyalty, prompting him to diversify his media diet and seek out more information about the president’s record. He considers himself proof that Trump supporters can change their ways, a message he wants to bring to the Principles First summit.“I want some of the Democrats to understand that there’s a lot of Republicans out there that are good people, and if Democrats work for those people, then they will be able to pull some of those people over to their side,” Swisher said. “But unfortunately, it’s going to be a heavy lift. It’s going to take a lot of work, and it’s going to take patience.”I am wagering a bet that many in the Maga community … are going to realize that the president is not going to fix anything for themRich LogisSweetser and Logis both predicted that Trump’s eventual failure to follow through on key campaign promises, like addressing the high inflation seen in recent years, would chip away at the president’s base and perhaps spur some of his supporters to reconsider their political identity.Some early examples of this trend may already be emerging. In Sweetser’s home state of Alabama, about 250 customers of a public utility company based in Huntsville justlearnedthey would see a $100 surcharge on their energy bills after one of Trump’s executive orders paused a program aimed at lowering heating costs for low-income households.“I am wagering a bet that many in the Maga community right now are going to realize that the president is not going to fix anything for them,” Logis said. “When the scales start to fall a bit from the eyes, I want them to know that there’s an exit ramp.”That exit ramp eventually brought Logis to the Democratic national convention, where he was featured ina videoexplaining his transformation from a diehard Trump supporter to a Harris voter. Harris may not have been successful in November, but Mayo still sees a potential path to victory for a pro-democracy candidate who can unify the ideologically diverse group represented at Principles First.“There’s still a broad coalition out there that can be assembled, and it has got to be constructive. It’s got to have ideas and solutions for the challenges that Americans face, like the affordability crisis,” Mayo said. “At a time when it feels hopeless, it feels like there is a reason to be hopeful when you see that many people coming together to talk about these things.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsFar right (US)Washington DCDemocratsDonald TrumpRepublicansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ever since the 2008 financial crisis Berlin has sought to burnish a reputation as the world capital of fiscal discipline, with a near-pious aversion to debt and pride in strong government finances.Under a rule known as the “debt brake” – introduced in 2009 byAngela Merkelto show Germany was committed to balancing the books after the banking crash – the federal government is required to limit annual borrowing to 0.35% of GDP.Afterthis weekend’s electionsit might not be long before the constitutional handbrake is relaxed to help reboot Europe’s largest economy with debt-funded firepower, and to find room for higher defence spending.“It is seismic. We are about to take a new direction in the economic policies ofEurope,” said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at the ING bank.“Back then [2009] the German approach [to sustainable public finances] was one completely ignoring growth, trying to lead by example with the debt brake. Now we see Germany paying the price for having fiscal rules that were too simplistically looking at the public finances and not growth.”All eyes on far-right AfD in German election rocked by violence and US interferenceRead moreGermans will vote on Sunday in a snap general election, after last November’scollapse of the “traffic light” coalitionled by chancellor Olaf Scholz’s centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), with the Free Democratic party (FDP) and the Greens.Opinion polls suggest that the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader, Friedrich Merz, is likely to become the next chancellor, in a possible grand coalition with the SPD, after ruling out a formal agreement with the far-rightAlternative für Deutschland(AfD).With Germany in effective recession after the economyshrank for two consecutive years, in 2023 and 2024 – and for only the third time since the 1950s – rebooting growth and raising living standards is a top issue on the ballot. Each of the major parties has promised to revive the economy, with policies either to slash taxes or drastically increase spending to pump-prime growth. However, these costly options are likely to require the debt brake to be relaxed.The proposals follow an “almost stereotypical” split between centre-left and centre-right economic policies, says Brzeski. The SPD and Greens propose investment subsidies and tax rises for the rich, alongside reforms to the debt brake, while the CDU wants tax cuts for corporate households, public expenditure cuts, and “hoping for the magic Laffer curve to bring in more tax revenues via higher growth”.The CDU had promised in its manifesto to stick to the debt brake, orschuldenbremse. But Merz has indicated a willingness to reform the policy amid growing acknowledgment of Germany’s growth headache. Critically, Merkel, the most recent CDU chancellor, whose successive governments demanded deep austerity from other eurozone countries during the 2010s’ sovereign debt crisis, hascalled for it to be dropped.View image in fullscreenAngela Merkel, who introduced the debt brake in 2009, has recently called for it to be dropped.Photograph: Maja Hitij/Getty ImagesCritics of the debt brake say baking in austerity in tax and spending decisions contributed to the rise of the far right as low-income households were hit hard. It also rattled Scholz’s coalition, amid fierce battles over multibillion-euro holes in the federal budget, paving the way for this weekend’s elections.Engelbert Stockhammer, a professor of international political economy at King’s College London, said lifting the debt brake would be key to Germany’s revival. “It [the brake] condemns the state to inactivity in times of crisis, whether the crisis be economic, the climate crisis or about security.”He said while the economic debate ahead of the election centred on whether to lift the brake to fund business tax breaks versus a more statist agenda of public investment to improve roads, the rail network and the digital infrastructure, the need for a bigger military budget will provide the new government with political cover.“It’s the geopolitical situation that is going to achieve it. The armed forces need an offensive capability and arguing for that is something conservative politicians will feel comfortable doing.”With EU nations under pressure to increase defence spending asDonald Trump obliterates the decades-old world order, Germany in particular will need to change its approach. The country has historically spent less than the 2% of GDP target Nato countries must spend on defence. While it said itmet the goal in 2024, it falls short of Trump’s calls for spending as much as 5%.Analysts say a new government could get around this by utilising special purpose vehicles earmarked for long-term investment, which would be excluded from the accounts for the debt rule. Defence spending could also be exempted. EU nations are also exploring the option of joint defence bonds, or an escape clause from the blocs’ “Stability and Growth Pact,” which Germany currently meets, which limits government deficits to 3% of GDP and debt under 60%However, the brake may need relaxing further to deal with a cocktail of economic problems facing the German economy – including extreme pressure on the country’s traditionally dominant industrial base, faltering domestic demand and mounting competition from Chinese manufacturers.Trump’s threat of hitting the EU with tariffswould add further to the squeeze.Albrecht Ritschl, a professor of economic history at the London School ofEconomics, said: “The lack of machine tool sales acts like a flat tyre on the economy. And this combines with a confluence of factors that have all come together at the same time – a fall in trade with the UK due to Brexit, no more sales to Russia, the cost of energy and a dramatic decline in the fertility rate.”Reforming the debt brake requires a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag, as it forms part of the German constitution, meaning the ability to make changes will depend on the outcome of the election. In a splintered political landscape, reforms may also take time to negotiate.“The chances are extremely high it will be relaxed, whatever outcome,” said Brzeski. “It is obvious there are large investment needs in the economy. They won’t manage without touching the debt brake.”Explore more on these topicsEconomicsGermanyEuropeAngela MerkelanalysisShareReuse this content"

Can Starmer’s US visit change the weather?As the US president turns on allies and embraces Russia, can the UK prime minister persuade Trump to listen to Europe’s concernsEurope live – latest updatesPatrick WintourDiplomatic editorFri 21 Feb 2025 05.41 ESTFirst published on Fri 21 Feb 2025 05.39 ESTShareIn November 1940, Winston Churchill sent a telegram to Franklin Roosevelt expressing relief both at the US president’s re-election and the victory of his anti-appeasement policy. “Things are afoot which will be remembered as long as the English language is spoken in any quarter of the globe, and in expressing the comfort I feel that the people of the United States have once again cast these great burdens upon you, I must now avow my sure faith that the lights by which we steer will bring us safely to anchor,” he wrote.As Keir Starmer andEmmanuel Macronprepare to meet a very different US president, things are once again afoot that will live long in the memory – but this time the lights seem to be going out on a ship adrift in a sea of chaos.In hisArsenal of Democracyspeech, Roosevelt spurned those who asked to “throw the US weight on the scale in favour of a dictated peace”. He also saw past Nazi Germany’s “parade of pious purpose” to observe “in the background the concentration camps and ‘servants of God’ in chains”.View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Macron welcomes Keir Starmer in Paris before an informal summit of European leaders to discuss the situation in Ukraine and European security.Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/GettyDonald Trump, by contrast, glories in the prospect of a US-dictated peace and in Russia he sees no gulags.Starmer’s nightmare is that the transatlantic alliance forged in the second world war is crumbling before his eyes. The inconceivable has become not just possible, but probable, or as Macron put it on Wednesday: “Do not think that the unthinkable cannot happen, including the worst.”If the central tenets of the postwar order are disintegrating, one of the casualties is likely to be Britain’s self-appointed role as the US’s bridge toEurope. There is a macabre circularity that France and the UK feel it necessary to plead with Trump to recall the US’s history as the generous country that kept the flame of freedom alive in Europe.1:36US must provide ‘backstop’ to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again, says Starmer – videoMargaret MacMillan, a professor of international history at Oxford, fears Trump will not listen to their case. “Never underestimate the importance of individuals in history, especially if they wield a great deal of power, and Donald Trump has got his hands on the levers of the most powerful country in the world. He is not controllable by anyone … He does not have a clear set of policies, but a set of likes and dislikes. Decisions are based on emotion and whim and last moment ideas,” she said.“Even great powers need allies – and yet he is turning on his allies.”Europe was braced psychologically for Trump to refuse further military aid to Ukraine on the basis the US had dispensed enough, and the killing had become a senseless stalemate. But it was never foreseen that in turning off the tap he would parrot Russian propaganda, baselessly accusing Ukraine’s leadership of starting the war, and falselydescribing Volodymr Zelenskyy as a “dictator”.View image in fullscreenPeople wear masks of Elon Musk, the AfD candidate for chancellor Alice Weidel, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and JD Vance in protest against the support of US and Russia for the far-right AfD party in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.Photograph: Ebrahim Noroozi/APSuch language risks in effect Trump’s America swapping sides in the war. How does Europe react?The necessary first response, out of self-respect, was to reject the US president’s framing of the war, as did the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, when he described Trump’s words as “an unprecedented distortion of reality and extremely dangerous”.The second step has been to appeal to those with sense in the US that their leader is taking them down a disastrous path. But Trump long ago cleansed the current Republican party of politicians that challenged his rule. Republicans have discovered challenging Trump was not a profitable career path.Trump brings Russia in from the cold, but at what cost to Ukraine? – podcastRead moreTrump’s chief consideration inassembling his foreign policy team has been loyalty, not talent.It leaves foreign diplomats with few pressure points to exploit.H R McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser during his first term, insisted there were still ways to talk Trump around. “He is reflexively contrarian – if you go to him and say everybody agrees on this Mr President, he will do the opposite just to spite you. The technique I would use is to say: ‘This is what Vladimir Putin wants you to say, and this is why he wants you to say it.’ I would show to him what is happening in Russian markets and say: ‘You have just given this psychological gift tothe Russians who are celebrating.’“The Europeans need to come out with a clear message: ‘Whatever you do, do not give Putin what he wants upfront.’ What does he want upfront? Sanctions relief. Keep him backed into the damned corner.”Kim Darroch, the former UK ambassador to Washington, suggested Macron and Starmer force Trump to focus on the details, such as how he intends to apply pressure on Putin – something that is absent from his current discourse.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump meets Volodymyr Zelenskyy in New York in September. The US president has dismissed the Ukraine president as a ‘minor comic’.Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/ReutersAlexander Stubb, the Finnish president, suggested Trump simply did not understand what might be at stake for the US. He said: “We have to convince the US that Ukraine’s future is a decisive question not only forUkraine, but also for European security, the international system and the US’s status as a great power. Our duty is to make clear what the consequences would be if Putin gets what he wants.”Macron and Starmer know Europe’s hand badly needs strengthening, especially since it became clear that Europe was not only going to be sidelined in talks betweenRussiaand the US, but would still be expected to police any settlement – without any help from the Americans.In Paris, first with the major European leaders in person, and then by video with the smaller EU countries, Macron tried to adopt the role of convener in chief. In the words of the former French defence official Camille Grand, the aim was to show Europe “deserved to be at the table but not on the menu”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scholz, facing federal elections this weekend, left early describing discussion of troops as premature, and insisting nothing could be done without US support. Giorgia Meloni arrived late, and was suspicious that the US was being undermined. Smaller nations were nervous of an electoral backlash.Only Starmer, after four hours of talks with British defence officials,went public with a firm if imprecise offer of troops–contingent on a US “backstop”since without its air, logistics and communications support, the operation would not be safe. It was a bold move by the normally cautious Starmer, but he was nervous of the corrosive impact Trump’s remarks would have on Ukrainian troop morale. Macron characterised it as a “dissuasion” force, saying “if there is no such dissuasion, Russia will not keep its word”.Western officials added that the purpose of the US backstop would be to make sure a European landforce would not be challenged by Russia – which would require air support and efforts to make the Black Sea safe international waters.The landforce would not need to be as high as 30,000, since the US backstop – probably US aircraft based in Romania and Lask airbase in Poland – would be ready to respond if the ceasefire was about to be breached.The European landforce would provide confidence to Ukrainians, undertaking protection tasks, and in the process encouraging Ukrainians abroad to return to their homeland.So the kernel of the talks in Washington will be persuasive and probing. Trump will be asked to drop his objection to a US backstop, and to lay out clearly how and on what terms he expects Putin permanently to end the war.But Trump’svicious dismissalof the “minor comic” Zelenskyy and the US refusal to describe Russia as the aggressor in planned UN and G7 statements do not bode well for a ceasefire – let alone a peace treaty.1:45US and Russia to explore closer relations after Ukraine talks in Riyadh, Rubio says – videoSuch comments show how Trump’s apparent personal grudge against Zelenskyy has become hard policy, and reflect his framing of the conflict in which Ukraine is not the victim, but the aggressor – and so does not deserve a seat at the negotiating table.As Richard Haass, the director of the Council on Foreign Relations, said from the US perspective: “The phase in whichVladimir Putinis treated as a pariah is over.”Opposition to Russian aggression has been the centrepiece of UK foreign policy since Ernest Bevin was the foreign secretary. As recently as 2023, the Strategic Defence Review described Russia as the most acute threat to the UK’s security. And last September, the directors of MI6 and the CIA issued a rare joint statement warning that Russian intelligence was waging a campaign of sabotage across Europe and“[using] technology to spread lies and disinformation to drive wedges between us”.Jonathan Powell, Starmer’s national security adviser, warned in 2010 that the UK would be in danger of sliding into irrelevance “if we have neither the strong transatlantic relationship or a strong role in Europe”.Powell urged the UK to stay close to US presidents, even when things get tough because they will remember it and reward the UK by letting its officials give counsel to the world’s only superpower. The necessary price for such influence was discretion and domestic accusations of being the US’s poodle.Fifteen years later that strategy is under intolerable strain.Brexit has happened and if Trump continues on its current path towards Russia, the UK faces the unenviable choice of distancing itself from its most important postwar partner – or renouncing all that it has ever believed about Russia.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerDonald TrumpEmmanuel MacronRussiaUkraineEuropean UnionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Romanian government hassinceconfirmed this was a request but denied there was political “pressure”.The alliance between theTrump administrationand the Tate brothers has been in the making for a long time. Paul Ingrassia, one of the lawyers Andrew Tate hired to fight his human trafficking case, was recently sworn in as the White House liaison for the Department of Justice. According to him, the Tate brothers were “sacrificed on the altar of the Matrix under the banner of egregious crimes they never committed”.Andrew Tate has been friends since 2016 withDonald Trump Jr, who called Tate’s detention “absolute insanity”. Donald Trump himself also appeared on a stream with the Andrew Tate sycophant and collaborator Adin Ross in August 2024. Around the same time, JD Vance appeared on the pro-Tate podcast the Nelk Boys.Elon Musk responded to Tate’s plan to “run for prime minister of the UK” by saying “he’s not wrong” and JD Vance followed both Tate brothers on X in December.View image in fullscreenAndrew Tate is led by police officers to the court of appeal in Bucharest, Romania on 12 March 2024, following his and his brother’s arrests.Photograph: Daniel Mihăilescu/AFP/Getty ImagesAlina Habba, who now holds the high-ranking political adviser role of counselor to the president, has said she is a “big fan” ofAndrew Tate. “I sympathize with you,” Habba told Tate on a rightwing podcast, “because I think you go through a lot of the same ‘show-me-the-person-I’ll-find-the-crime’ that President Trump has gone through … I agree with everything you say, and I have your back, out here in the States.”After Trump won the 2024 election, Tate tweeted that his case would be “dismissed”. “Watch this space ;-),” he said.Tate has access to the highest levels of Trump’s inner circle. If, as he is insinuating, he has convinced the administration to act on his behalf, they would be attempting to interfere with dozens of alleged human trafficking and rape victims’ quest for justice.Trump and Tate have a lot in common, and both stand to gain much from each other. They are disinformation virtuosos, having sought to delegitimize criminal allegations against them through information warfare. They both mastered their loud, obnoxious performance of self under the lights and cameras of reality TV (The Apprenticefor Trump,Big Brotherfor Tate), before using the same model to dominate social media. There, among the likes and the shares and the algorithms, they learned that while truth and integrity get you nothing, controversy, lies and extremism can be easily transmuted into fame, wealth and power.Tate is aware of the value he can offer politicians. In January he instructed his associates tocalltwo Romanian rightwing politicians to tell them: “You will get a lot of votes when Tate says you took their side,” according to prosecutors who tapped his phone. Whereas this Romanian politician ultimately turned Andrew Tate down, the Trump administration apparently has fewer scruples.But the Tate-Trump alliance is about more than just votes, especially now Trump has won. The Trump administration and Tate are both promoting a conspiracy theory thatUSAidand the mainstream media have worked together to fabricate charges against Tate. By supporting him, the Trump administration is forging a new axis of disinformation to go after the press and the very idea of justice and due process.Before we get into that, let’s remind ourselves of what exactly the Tate brothers are being accused of.Andrew Tate is a misogynist influencer and conspiracy theorist. The charges against him and his brother mostly relate to the webcam sex businesses they operated first in the UK and then inRomania.Tate and his brother are accused of either trafficking, raping, grooming or abusing at least 48 alleged victims in total. They have denied all charges.Four of these women are pursuing a civil case in the UK against Andrew for rape or physical abuse (three of them had previously reported Tate to the UK police for sexual violence and physical abuse, but the Crown Prosecution Service decided against bringing charges in 2019). Both brothers are also being investigated for crimes of sexual aggression relating to at least two separate women by Bedfordshire police, who have obtained a European arrest warrant for them.In 2023 Romanian authorities formally charged the Tate brothers with rape, human trafficking and forming an organised crime group to sexually exploit women, naming seven alleged victims. Prosecutors allege Andrew Tate raped at least one of them repeatedly and coerced the women through threats of violence and financial ruin. In 2024 they filed a second indictment which mentions 35 alleged victims of trafficking, including one who was 15 years old at the time. Both Tate brothers deny all of these allegations, and have repeatedly characterised them as a coordinated attack by “the Matrix”.View image in fullscreenAndrew Tate and his brother Tristan, right, in Bucharest, Romania, on 30 January 2024.Photograph: Vadim Ghirdă/APOurworkuncoveredAndrew Tate’s War Room Network, which trains men how to manipulate vulnerable women into sex work. Andrew Tate denies any wrongdoing and says he is prepared to defend his innocence.I have met many of these women. Their stories are horrific. Many have told me stories of violent strangulation. Andrew Tate texted one of them: “I love raping you.” When asked about this text in 2023 and 2024 Tate did not respond, but he has denied any accusation of rape.Rightwing pundits have been attempting to delegitimize the cases against the Tates for years.When they came forward with their allegations, many of the alleged victims werecalledmisogynistic slurs by thousands of Tate supporters, liars by manosphere podcasters like Sneako and Fresh and Fit, and “paid actresses” in viral posts on X. Some also suffered witness intimidation and abuse. Tate’s other lawyer, Joseph McBride, who worked with the White House official Paul Ingrassia, publicly named one of the alleged victims (who was meant to stay anonymous) and discussed her “body count” on the Fresh and Fit podcast, leading to online harassment. Another Tate ally, the self-proclaimed “investigative journalist”, Sulaiman Ahmed, showed up outside one of the alleged victims’ parents’ house in Florida. The victims’ legal representatives claimhe was paidby Tate to silence her in a conspiracy that “amounts to witness tampering”.Court documents from the second Tate indictment in Romania allege that after he was moved from jail to house arrest, Tate attempted to pay one of his alleged victims – a 15-year-old – €2,500to say“only good things” about him to the Romanian authorities.The potential for witness tampering and interference is one of the reasons the Tate brothers have been placed under judicial control. Another is that they might try to escape Romania. (The streamer Adin Ross said Tate told him he at one point planned to leave Romania and “never come back”.) Tate’s team have denied the brothers are a flight risk.By pressuring the Romanian authorities to release the Tate brothers from judicial control, Trump’s special envoy Grenell could be seen as hampering Romanian due process and multiple human trafficking investigations, not to mention breaking Article 41 of the Vienna convention which requires that diplomats don’t interfere with domestic affairs in their guest country. If someone was accused of similar crimes in the US, they would almost certainly not be allowed to leave the country – and the administration knows this.So why support someone being investigated for human trafficking?For those of us following closely, all the signs of a coordinated disinformation attack on the media and the courts by the Trump administration, the Tates, and a network of far-right agitators and pundits are there. Tate’s attack lines are parroted by the Trump administration and vice versa.On 3 February, Tristan Tatesuggesteda conspiracy theory on X that USAid could somehow be involved in the investigation into the Tates. Hours later, Grenell, Trump’s special envoy,respondedthat Romania was the “latest example” of how “USAid programs were weaponised against people and politicians who weren’t woke”. The implication that it is “woke” to oppose the Tates is a new low for the “Maga” movement. But this is simply the latest round of artillery in an information war in which Andrew Tate and Trump are natural allies.The day after Grenell’s comment on X, Elon Musk boosted a post saying that “USAid funds the BBC”. (The reality? USAid made a $1.9m donation to the BBC’s media charity in India.) Andrew Tate was quick to jump on the bandwagon,replyingto Elon: “The real redpill as that all of these ‘other’ funders of the BBC are ALSO funded by USAID. ALL OF IT IS USAID. Propaganda arm of The Matrix.” (Tate hates the BBC because the documentaries I’ve made about him were commissioned there.)View image in fullscreenAndrew and Tristan Tate are escorted by police officers outside the headquarters of the court of appeal, in Bucharest, Romania, on 10 January 2023.Photograph: Inquam Photos/OCTAV GANEA/ReutersOn 17 February, the conspiracy evolved, with Tate nowclaiming: “It was Biden who locked us up in the first place. USAid-sponsored attack. UK Foreign Office heavily involved. They want me to serve time for tweets. None of the charges against me were ever real.”USAid. The legacy media. The Romanian courts. The Biden administration. Tate seamlessly weaves them all into one giant convoluted conspiracy that’s bent on putting him in jail to prevent his wisdom from freeing young men. He does so with support from the Trump administration and Musk. (In January Musk, who reinstated Tate’s account after buying Twitter, tweeted “Great point” to an Xpostthat read: “The same government and journalists who accused the Tates of sex trafficking overlooked actual sex trafficking.” One of his “department of government efficiency” employeesappears to be a Tate fan.)Paul Ingrassia, the former Tate lawyer who is now a White House liaison for the Department of Justice, once wrote a sycophanticblog post about the Tatesin which he never discusses the allegations or the case itself but audaciously accuses the media of using the Tate brothers as scapegoats to “drown out” the “real victims” and “legitimate cases of sexual abuse and sex trafficking”.Ingrassia never responds to specific allegations or evidence, nor provides an argument as to why the allegations are “bald-faced lies”. The facts are never discussed.The idea that someone could be accused of heinous sexual crimes and successfully delegitimize those allegations as a politically motivated sham is presumably appealing to Trump and his inner circle, many of whom have themselves faced allegations of sexual assault.Not once has an official in the Trump administration said anything about the 48 alleged victims who say they were either raped, trafficked, physically abused, or a combination of the above, one of whom is an American citizen. They deserve due process without interference.Judicial independence is protected by law in Romania, but in practice judges have beenunlawfully influenced. They will hopefully carry out their investigation regardless of what Trump’s cronies say.Ingrassia, in his excoriation of the supposedly anti-Tate media, wrote: “The real victims are once again forgotten, lost beneath the howls and cries of those in command of the mainstream media loudspeaker, who drown out – and thereby, exacerbate – legitimate cases of sexual abuse and sex trafficking.”But this quote reeks of projection. It is true in reverse, as the loudspeaker belongs to “Maga” and Tate. The challenge journalists now face is to be louder.Matt Shea is a film-maker and the co-author ofClown Word, Four Years Inside Andrew Tate’s MansophereExplore more on these topicsAndrew TateDonald TrumpTrump administrationThe far rightFar right (US)RomaniaEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Now – after a frenzied election campaign in which most politicians have scrambledto ward offthe rise of the far rightwith tough talk on migrants – she wondered what the consequences would be for the lives they had painstakingly built.“It’s scary,” she said. Worse still, the torrent of anti-migrant rhetoric had seemingly done little tostem the rise of the Alternative für Deutschlandparty (AfD), with polls suggesting that the far-right party is poised to vault into an unprecedented second place in Sunday’s election.“They are against Islam, against Arabs,” she added. “Who knows if they will bring in laws against us? It’s really upsetting.”Her words were a hint of the high stakes at play as Germany heads to the ballot box. Migration has loomed large in the lead-up to the election, cast repeatedly as a problem to be solved; from Olaf Scholz’spromise to “deport people more often and faster”to the proposals by the conservative opposition leader, Friedrich Merz, to turn away asylum seekers at Germany’s borders and revoke the citizenship of dual nationals who commit a crime.Both have seemingly sought to keep pace with the AfD, who have peddledpromises of remigrationand repeatedly tied migration to crime, falsely tarring the millions of Germans who hail from around the world and live peacefully in and contribute to the country.“It’s the first time, I would say, that I really feel like a foreigner in my own country,” said Cihan Sinanoğlu, a social scientist who works with the German Centre for Integration and Migration Research. “Racialised people and groups understand that the whole debate about migration is also a debate about us, about what it means to be German and who’s in and who’s out.”German election 2025 poll tracker: which party is leading and who could be chancellor?Read moreThe myopic focus on migration had also allowed most politicians to skirt around the many challenges facingGermany, from soaring housing costs to the climate crisis and widening inequality. “Nobody wants to talk about structural problems,” said Sinanoğlu. “So all of the bad things in the world are projected on to this figure of the migrant or asylum seeker; rents, economy systems, poverty. That’s crazy.”The result was an election that had left many reeling. “I’m super scared and many of my friends are scared,” said one 28-year-old, who asked not to be named.She had arrived in Germany from Syria in 2015, as a wave of“welcome culture” swept across the country, transforming Germany into a safe place for more than a million people fleeing conflict and persecution. Now she wondered how many people she knew were gearing up to embrace a far-right partywhose ranks include neo-Nazis.“They are our neighbours, they are parents. And they are daring to again choose fascism,” she said.View image in fullscreenTyron Ricketts, who said that the election campaign has bypassed any notion of strength found in diversity.Photograph: Steffen Roth/The GuardianThe campaign had laid bare politicians’ stunning failure to tell a different story about Germany, one capable of capturing how the country’s diversity – from those with migration backgrounds to LGBTQ+ people – could be harnessed to tackle challenges such as ageing infrastructure and an ailing economy, said Tyron Ricketts, a film-maker and storyteller.“Even before the election, the political climate was hijacked by the right-wing party,” he said. “And that comes with the tragic terrorist attacks being politicised rather than talking about the other real problems.”The absence of any kind of inclusive model has helped to fuel scapegoating, said Ricketts. “I know that has worked before and especially in Germany, but it’s just a super dangerous game,” he said. “And I think it’s quite shameful for the parties that call themselves democratic and centre, or centre-right, to adopt those kinds of techniques.”This week, the Munich-based Ifo Institutepublished a studythat found there was “no correlation” between migration and higher crime rates. “The same applies in particular to refugees,” a researcher, Jean-Victor Alipour, said in a statement.View image in fullscreenIsabel, 21, and Samira, 25, who feels that migration has added to German society.Photograph: Steffen Roth/The GuardianIn central Berlin, surrounded by shops staffed by migrants, Samira, 25, lamented how politicians had chosen to depict those who come from abroad. “Migrants are a big part of Berlin and Germany in general,” she said, pointing to her father’s roots in the African country of Chad. “Without migrants, we wouldn’t have a lot of things that we currently have … I don’t really see why we should push them out.”It was a point that has been highlighted throughout the campaign by trade unions, economists and thinktanks. After the fall of the Assad regime ledsome politicians to call for Syrians to returnto their home country, the German Economic Institute swiftly said that about 80,000 Syrians were working in sectors experiencing deep labour shortages, from the auto industry to dentistry and childcare.More than 5,000 Syrian doctors were also fully employed in the country, meaning returns could result in “critical shortages” in medical services, it noted.The country’s reliance on migration to sustain its economy, however, has rarely been addressed by politicians during the campaign. Instead, many have leaned on a one-sided narrative, emboldening the far right in a way that could have dire impacts on people of colour, said Olivia, 23, whose father hails from Nigeria.“You can feel it already,” she added. “It’s shifting already but it will probably get worse. I’m scared of seeing that in the future.”All eyes on far-right AfD in German election rocked by violence and US interferenceRead moreIn September, Germany’s federal anti-discrimination commissioner, Ferda Ataman, linked the rise of the far right to a “discrimination crisis”,citing the morethan 20,000 cases that had poured into her office between 2021 and 2023.“Millions of people are afraid for their future,” Ataman said at the time. “In view of the electoral successes of right-wing extremists, it is more important than ever to protect people effectively from hatred and exclusion.”In Germany’s eastern states, where nearly a third of voters cast their ballots for the far right in lastautumn’s state elections, migrant groupshave warned of a spike in attacksas people report being spat on, sworn at, attacked, and punched in the face.View image in fullscreenMarkus Beeko, 57, feels that the election narratives have driven a wedge between sections of German society.Photograph: Steffen Roth/The GuardianWith days left until the vote, far-right actors like the AfD have already had success in that they have managed to usher in new divisions across Germany, said Markus Beeko as he crossed through one of the city boroughs formerly divided between East and West Berlin.“You don’t see that there’s enough sensitivity around the fact that this is a debate where everyone should stand up. Like if you’re in a workplace, you want people to say ‘OK, we understand that this is an attack on you as a colleague and we are standing with you.’”While somehad taken to the streetsto protest against the shifting political climate, many others in media and beyond had not clearly rejected far-right views, added the 57-year-old.“And I think for many people who feel attacked – be it that you are female, transgender, or have a different cultural background – for many people it really stresses the feeling that they don’t belong,” he said. “And I think this is something which would be hard to heal and reconcile with because it has a lasting effect.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’re at Acmi’s celebration of The Sims’ 25th birthday, inside a Y2K-inspired pop-up styled by the interior designer influencers and diehard Simmers Josh and Matt. There are a couple of blocky PCs where people can play the original Sims. There is also a grim reaper and a llama wandering around.The pool question makes a lot of sense to anyone who has ever spent hours on the blockbuster game. Any dedicated player knows the terrifying death by drowning that awaits their Sim if theytake away the pool ladder.View image in fullscreenAcmi’s birthday party for The Sims featured blocky PCs and Y2K designs. And also … a llama.Photograph: Arianna HarryIt’s just one of the dark – and borderline off-putting – details that made the original Sims game so great.On paper, the Sims is the archetype of the cosy life simulator game, which has continued in popularity with blockbusters including Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley. The franchise has sold nearly 200m copies worldwide, and is one of the bestselling video game series of all time.Wait! The Sims is a lot bleaker than I rememberRead moreBut like many games in the 2000s, there was a kind of wild-west weirdness to the original Sims. Lynchian details like a sad clown who would come to your house unless you burn a painting of him. The year I was obsessed with The Sims, I was meant to be studying for my HSC exams, but instead compulsively built houses full of people from school that I disliked, and then elaborately organised ways to murder them. Sometimes your Sims would just get stuck in a corner and slowly piss themselves to death.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning“I’d put men who have wronged me and certain politicians in my pool,” my friend informs me. I have to agree.Of course, there is more than sociopathy to the game. While later Sims incarnations fleshed out the scope of the suburban simulator to such a degree that you had vampires and fairies and all sorts of exotic additions, the first game was a kind of terrifying facsimile of life that boiled down to work and survival.View image in fullscreenAcmi’s installation celebrating all things Sims – including the famous woohoo bed.Photograph: Arianna HarryYour Sims lived in a perpetual work-week without break, never ageing, fearing the randomness of a watery death, perpetually hustling towards the goal of earning enough money so they could buy a television to increase their happiness levels. Life, as The Sims forecast, is brief and repetitive: all about buying enough stuff so that you can remove enough stress from your life to breed before you die. Or before you burn to death in a kitchen without doors.The only way you could escape the relentless and punishing grind of capitalism was to use the widely popular cheat codes – a lesson I’m sure has led to more than a fair share of Sims players to white-collar crimes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While everybody is clearly having a good time, nobody dances. All the attenders mill around with a lack of purpose that feels entirely … Sim-like.Gretel Killeen is on hand to launch the party with her acerbic wit; at the end of her speech she thanks the audience of gamers for leaving their chairs to be here. Killeen focuses on the nostalgia of the Sims era, forcing us to remember what life looked like circa 2000 – not just in the game, but in our own homes, with our computer rooms and landlines.View image in fullscreen‘It hardly feels like a coincidence that Big Brother and The Sims were such massive hits at the same time’: Gretel Killeen presents at the Acmi launch party.Photograph: Arianna HarryKilleen’s breakout, of course, came in the same era withBig Brother, and it hardly feels like a coincidence that the reality show and The Sims were such massive hits at the same time. It was an era where curiosity and voyeurism about other people’s lives was a novelty, and the kind of mundane surveillance that both these franchises provided was weirdly intoxicating. I was so obsessed with the 2002 season of Big Brother that I even replicated the Big Brother mansion in The Sims, complete with a pixelated Gretel Killeen wandering around. I never put her in the pool.The greatest twist of Acmi’s party, perhaps, is that it’s on a Thursday night, and most of us are working tomorrow. Maybe that’s the true sadism of The Sims, too: the fact we spent so many hours simulating the inescapable grind of work as children, only to enter it in real life years later. I can only hope that someone up there takes pity on me, and lets me gather enough belongings in my life to be happy, and pays enough attention to me that I don’t die from pissing myself in a corner of a house somewhere.Acmi’sweekend of Sims 25th birthday celebrationsruns until Sunday 23 February in MelbourneExplore more on these topicsCultureGamesSimulation gamesPCBig BrotherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is laughable that they pretend it is,” said Iryna, 26, a lawyer from Kyiv.Iryna was among thousands of Ukrainians who got in touch with the Guardian to share how they felt about the Trump administration-led peace talks with Russia, which excludeUkraine.“It doesn’t seem like a negotiation to me, more like a cruel auction. My main concern is that we are being sold for someone else’s gain. I am afraid that the USA sees us as just an asset to sell and move on, whileEuropeis too concerned about itself.”Iryna’s comments were echoed by many other respondents to a callout, with Ukrainians living in the wartorn country as well as in other countries around the globe voicing their shock and frustration, but also defiance of what they deemed absurd and unacceptable proposals emerging from talks between Washington and the Kremlin about a possible deal to end the war.While outrage overTrump’s comments in recent dayswas most common, hundreds of Ukrainians also vented their frustrations about European leaders and previous US administrations, who they felt had never supported them sufficiently in their fight against Putin since hisannexation of Crimea in 2014.“There is only one problem: insufficient and untimely military assistance from allies, including the United States,” said Serhii, a 50-year-old accountant. Although he described Trump’s behaviour as “disgusting”, Serhii felt Russia’s track record of ignoring legally binding international agreements made it futile to negotiate an ordinary peace deal withRussia.“Another document, the so-called peace agreement, will turn into another piece of paper,” he said. “Trump can flex his muscles only in front of a country that adheres to international law. Therefore, all that Trump can do [if he wants to strike a deal] is accuse and put pressure on Ukraine and force it to make concessions to Russia.”I feel betrayed by the US and other states that could have done morePavlo, 24, from the north-western city of Lutsk, was among many who expressed hopelessness and despair.“I had hoped that we could put an end to the bloodshed, negotiate a fair deal for Ukraine, get some real security guarantees,” he said. “But in the light of recent events, our hopes have faded. We are very pessimistic about the outcome of the negotiations. The future is dark – either we keep fighting, losing friends and family to war, or we’ll be forced to accept a very bad deal and live in fear of future aggression from Russia. I feel betrayed by the US and other states that could have done more.”Pavlo was among many who shared how they felt about Trump’s call for elections in Ukraine and his portrayal of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, asillegitimately clinging to power. Zelensky, Pavlo said, was “widely regarded as an acceptable leader in Ukraine”.“Some Ukrainians criticise him – for example, for his appointed ministers. However, he delivers the voice of the majority of Ukrainians and is a 100% legitimate leader. No one in Ukraine, including the opposition, thinks it’s a good idea to have elections now.”Yulia*, 43, was as a postal worker in Mariupol until the Russian invasion. “Now,” she said, “I have no housing, no job, I’m a refugee.”“In short, Trump is [seemingly] proposing to give Putin my home town. Where Putin’s troopskilled [thousands of] civilians. They almost killed me and my child. Trump is proposing that the Russians get away with this monstrous crime, that the Russians get their illegal reward forkilling the civilians of Mariupol.View image in fullscreenPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy gives a press conference in Kyiv on Wednesday.Photograph: Tetiana Dzhafarova/AP“I will never agree to Russian murderers taking my city. Six generations of my ancestors are buried in Mariupol. My son was born in Mariupol. Russians stole our home, stole all our things, and now Trump [may want to] formalise this crime.”Despite her harsh criticism of the Trump administration, Yulia described herself as an opponent of President Zelenskyy, but did not contest his legitimacy and rejected US calls for fresh elections.Zelenskyy’s government, she felt, did not offer enough support to internally displaced people like herself, who lost their homes or jobs in the occupied territories.“My main problem is the lack of housing and work. People like me are forced to rely only on the help of European philanthropists. [Nonetheless], I think that elections are an internal matter of our country.”Trump doesn’t give a damn about UkraineThirty-year-old Oleksandra, a product marketer living in Kyiv, was born in the central city of Poltava, where her parents remain. The city is thesite of one of the deadliest attacks of the war, after a Russian missile strike hit a military training institute and a nearby hospital, killing at least 51 people and injuring more than 200 others.“Pushing us to elect a new leader while part of our territory is occupied and millions of people are either displaced or on the frontlines would benefit Russia, because it would force us to lift martial law, bring soldiers back home, and create the perfect opportunity for a new offensive.“But most importantly, according to our constitution, elections cannot be held under martial law. So Putin is trying to pressure us into disregarding our own legal system.”Trump, she added, echoing the views of many, should ask Putin to hold Russian elections first.“I don’t think Trump gives a damn about Ukraine,” she said. “And his so-called“deal” about natural resources?It feels like we’re the ones expected to pay reparations instead of Russia. It’s insane.”Trump wants to show he can achieve a deal in months, not yearsDaniel, a 27-year-old data scientist from Odesa who lives in the Netherlands, echoed the comments of others who assessed the situation through a prism of realpolitik.“It is not uncommon to not invite weaker parties to the table during diplomacy talks,” he said. “I can see Trump trying to get bonus diplomacy points in the eyes of his nation by showing that what the Democrats had been doing for almost three years before his election could actually be achieved in months, not years.”Trump’s vision for a more powerful America, he felt, was in line with Putin’s vision for a Russia that could be made great again – both of them visions, he reckoned, that were a direct consequence of “Europe’s infantility”, inability to make decisions and unwillingness to sacrifice a temporary stagnation of living standards in the fight against Putin.“Trump is ready to burden the costs of this war on Europe. I am almost sure that Europe won’t have enough willpower to take decisive actions to [respond effectively to] Trump’s initiatives.”Pavlo, 29, a marketing professional from Kyiv, was among many who felt that the US administration’s main focus was on portraying Trump as a successful deal-maker.“I feel that Trump wants to become a hero, to be the next Reagan, who warmed relations with the USSR which later led to its dissolution and an American win in the cold war,” he said. “Personally, I really want this war to end. It’s no fun to wake up every night to raid alert sirens and explosions. But I don’t want it on terms of total disrespect from our closest ally.”Hundreds of Ukrainians told the Guardian that they would reject any deal that involved concessions to Putin, and that they remained committed to fighting a neighbour they felt could not be trusted to make peace with.Ukraine will fight for as long as it canAmong them was a 31-year-old woman who had moved from Crimea to Kyiv and wanted to stay anonymous, as her family, members of the Indigenous ethnic minority of Crimean Tatars, remained in occupied Crimea. She had advised her mother and brother to not do web searches that could raise questions. Her close friend’s fiance, she said, had been killed a few days ago.“We as citizens are scared of peace on Trump’s and Putin’s terms, but we are not scared to keep fighting.” Ukraine, she felt certain, would never agree to give up Crimea. “People keep dying, but Ukraine will fight for as long as it can.”“Ukraine will have to keep fighting – deal or no deal,” said Katarina, 37, an interior designer and architect who left Kyiv when the war began and now lives in a small village in a suburb of the Ukrainian capital.“Obviously it’s going to be hard for us, but it’s definitely not the time to give up. What will happen if Ukraine stops fighting?”There was, Katarina felt, “a silver lining” to the dramatic situation the world now found itself in, with Trump’s plans for Russia having the potential to shock Europe into action.“Europe needs to get stronger. Europe needs to get united. Europe needs to get ready. Everyone should be spending more on defence considering the circumstances – Trump or no Trump.”*Name has been changed.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

That created a debt, along with the fact that resources of the Caribbean and the profits of these resources were sent to Europe, to North America, to build their cities, their universities, to develop the technologies, to advance their economies, and they left the Caribbean region bereft of necessary institutions for development – not even have proper educational facilities or healthcare facilities.”The issue of transatlantic slavery reparations dominated headlines in October when the British prime minister, Keir Starmer,resisted pressure from member statesto include reparations on the agenda at the Commonwealth summit.The move has triggered months of criticism and speculation about Britain’s engagement with Caribbean nations on the topic.Browne’s sentiments were echoed by the St Vincent and the Grenadines prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, who was a founding member of the Caribbean reparations movement.“Reparations are about addressing the legacies of underdevelopment which have been caused by native genocide and the enslavement of African bodies. We are asking those who benefited from slavery – including the European countries – for some recompense, some reparation, some repairing,” he said.Confirming reports thatCaricom’s 10-point planfor reparatory justice was being updated, he said that the slavery reparations movement is making progress: “It’s [been] raised in the US Congress, in the European Union and the British parliament, and the archbishop of Canterbury has addressed it, families from the past have addressed it. People thought when it started it was some little fringe thing, but it is moving to centre stage.”Exact reparations figures have not been agreed, the leaders said, but the focus now is on constructive collaboration on the issue, which they confirmed was raised during closed meetings on Thursday, which were also attended by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen,.In his final address as Caricom chairman, the Grenadian prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, said: “Your excellency, Ursula von der Leyen, I don’t mean to be impolite, but I will say to you that the issue of reparations for the transatlantic slavery … is an issue that we will take up with you.”He stressed that Caricom’s demand for reparations was not just about historical redress but about securing a commitment to justice that would prevent any form of human exploitation in the future.“As long as we do not openly and explicitly reject the idea that one human being can own another human being, we run the risk that that idea may somehow take root again and be allowed to flourish,” he warned.“And so, as descendants of people who fought for their freedom from chattel slavery, we owe it to ourselves and to future generations of humanity to ensure that the transatlantic slave trade and the enslavement of Africans in the Caribbean, Latin, Central, South and North America is accepted as a crime against humanity and that the appropriate apology and compensation is paid.”Mitchell also cited the issue of chattel slavery as he advocated for continued support of Haiti, whererampant gang warhas plunged the country into bloody anarchy.“Make no mistake, Haiti symbolises the revolution that changed this part of the world,” Mitchell said. “Had it not been for Haiti, the idea that one human being could own another human being as chattel slavery and put him to work for their profit may very well still be persisting.“And so we owe it to that island, all of us who are freed – the descendants of freed men and women who fought for their freedom – to ensure that we continue supporting and advocating for the partnership and the support to bring Haiti back from the brink.”Explore more on these topicsCaribbeanSlaveryEuropean UnionAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Early leaders of the Democratic party played a key role in shaping “one country, two systems”, a constitutional arrangement that promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and rights protections.After the city was handed over to China in 1997, the party became the most influential voice of opposition in Hong Kong’s legislature and led peaceful street demonstrations. The party’s fortunes declined after Beijing tightened its grip and imposed anational security lawin Hong Kong, afterhuge and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in 2019.“Developing democracy in Hong Kong is always difficult,” Lo said on Thursday. In recent years “we see a lot of civil society groups or political parties disbanding”, he added.Asked whether the democrats were pressured by Beijing to fold, Lo said he would not disclose details of internal discussions.Four of the party’s ex-lawmakers – including the former party leader Wu Chi-wai – are serving prison sentences after being found guilty of subversion under the national security law last year.The party no longer holds any legislature seats after Hong Kong changed its electoral system in 2021to ensure only “patriots” can take office.Emily Lau, a former legislator who has been with the Democratic party since its inception, said the development came as a shock. “We only had an AGM in December and we elected a new central committee … There was no sign there was no enthusiasm or money. Everyone knew the difficulties,” she said.Lau noted several parties had shut down since the crackdown on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement, suggesting the last signs of the “one country two systems” regime were being crushed. “It must show that freedom of association and expression and all that is a thing of the past.”Asked about the Democratic party’s legacy, Lau said: “Some Hong Kong people have very fond memories of the party and we have tried hard to work for the people and speak for the people. I’m not saying we’re the best, but we were one of the biggest and now we have no seats. It’s very sad.”A three-person team that includes Lo will look into the legal and accounting rules on party dissolution, as the start of a multi-step process. The group has 400 members and is not experiencing acute financial stress, according to Lo.A vote to dissolve the party will require the support of 75% of meeting participants.Lo said he hoped Hong Kong could return to values such as “diversity, inclusion and democracy” that underpinned its past success.Well-known figures from the party includeMartin Lee – hailed by some as Hong Kong’s “father of democracy”– as well as Albert Ho, who organised annual vigils to mark the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.Western nations including the US have criticised Hong Kong for curtailing rights.

The drill was conducted in international waters and in accordance with international law.‘Wilful acts of bastardry’: former Treasury secretary says young Australian workers ‘robbed’ by tax systemRead moreIt is understood at least three commercial flights diverted their course.The three Chinese naval ships – known as Taskgroup 107 – advised Australia early on Friday of plans to conduct a live-fire exercise.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe flotilla was being shadowed by a NZ navy vessel, which observed the drill. The ships changed formation and placed a target in the water, manoeuvred again, and then recovered the target. No live fire was observed, but the change in formation was consistent with a live-fire drill.It is understood there was no surface-to-air firing.Australia has askedChina– through defence attaches in Canberra and Beijing – for more information on the live-fire drill and plans for any further exercises.It is understood the drill, conducted at short notice, was viewed within theAustralian militaryas a “significant disruption” but not one that posed an elevated risk to airspace users.Anthony Albanese said China had issued an alert that it would be conducting the activities, including the potential use of live fire.“It’s outside of Australia’s exclusive economic zone,” he said.“Australia and New Zealand ships and aircraft have been monitoring the Chinese fleet while they have been travelling down the coast of Australia … as you would expect us to be doing.”Asked what his level of concern was, Albanese said the activity was consistent with international law and the Chinese had given warning.The shadow minister for defence, Andrew Hastie, accused the Chinese government of using “gunboat diplomacy”, blaming the “latest provocation” on weakness from the prime minister.“For two and a half years, Anthony Albanese and Richard Marles have refused to stand up for our ADF personnel,” he said.“The Australian people deserve to know what is going on, and they deserve better leadership from our weak prime minister.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are also working together to coordinate advice to operators and pilots.”The airspace protection zone – 18km around the Chinese vessels and up to 45,000ft – remained current.According to earlier Chinese media reports, the PLA-Navy frigate, cruiser and replenishment vessel have been conducting “real-combat” exercises in an unspecified part of the Pacific Ocean over the past month.The ships’ presence off Australia’s coast closely follows an incident in the SouthChinaSea last week in which a Chinese fighter jet released flares in front of an Australian military plane.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsChinaNew ZealandAsia PacificAustralian militarynewsShareReuse this content"

More than 30 nationalities have been identified among the workers, although many are from China.Thailand shares a porous border withMyanmar, which has been gripped by civil war since 2021, and it is common for refugees fleeing conflict, as well as commuters, to cross. A lack of enforcement has also allowed criminals to go back and forth to building complexes that stand near the border.On Thursday, double-decker coaches transported Chinese workers across the border. Four flights were due to take Chinese nationals home from Mae Sot on Thursday.Last week, an armed group in Myanmar handed over 260 scam centre workers from a dozen countries, including the Philippines, Ethiopia, Brazil, Nepal and Thailand.Thatchai said Thai officials would not collect the workers from inside Myanmar, but would instead meet them once they have been transferred to the Thai side.The Karen Border Guard Force (BGF), a group allied with the Myanmar junta which controls areas where many scam centres are based, told AFP it would it will deport 10,000 people linked to compounds.Hundreds of thousands of peoplehave been trafficked into the region from across the world, according to the UN,often lured by the promise of a comfortable office job. Once they arrive, they are held against their will and forced to generate income by carrying out online scams, targeting victims globally. Research by the US Institute of Peace estimated these scams generate $63.9bn a year in global revenue, the vast majority of which ($39bn) is generated in Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos.People recently released from the compounds have said they were beaten and electrified, showing media bruises and wounds.Thatchai said such claims should be looked at carefully. “Some of them voluntarily go there and work, try to scam other people, get lots of money and go back,” he said, adding that in other cases people were forced into criminality and subjected to violence.“Some syndicates use violence to control people... When you say ‘I don’t want to work here anymore’. But the syndicate has already invested in them [by paying for] the ticket for the transportation, for the cost of living.”Foreign nationals will be transferred to Thailand over the coming weeks and months, where they will be screened to determine whether they are a victim of human trafficking or have willingly carried out scams. Chinese nationals, who make up a large proportion of the returnees, will be screened in China, Thatchai said.View image in fullscreenAlleged scam centre workers and victims from China handed over from Myanmar board a plane at Mae Sot AirportPhotograph: Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP/Getty ImagesOther workers are from countries including Ethiopia, Kenya, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, he said.The recent crackdown follows thehigh profile disappearance of a Chinese actor Wang Xing, 22, who travelled to Thailand thinking he had a casting call with film producers, but was instead driven 500km to Mae Sot in western Thailand and trafficked over the border to work in a scam compound. His girlfriend, alarmed that she was no longer able to contact him, asked for help on social media and her post drew huge attention.Wang was found in January more than a month after his abduction, returning with a shaved head. The case threw a spotlight on the issue of human trafficking in the region and caused anxiety in Thailand, which feared the incident would damage its reputation as a tourist destination for Chinese tourists, a crucial market.On 4 February, Thailand cut power and internet to five locations inside Myanmar known to be hubs for scam syndicates in Myanmar, and placed restrictions on the sale of fuel.Thailand’s Provincial Electricity Authority has contracts to sell electricity to distributors in some areas of Myanmar.Across the border from Shwe Kokko, one of the infamous scamming hubs, the sound of generators can be heard. Some compounds were still operating, said Thatchai. “But they don’t operate fully, at their capacity,” he added. Previously, they were a 24 hour operation, he said. “Because they [target victims] different parts of the world.”China has shared names of thousands of Chinese nationals suspected of involvement in the syndicates, while China’s public security assistant minister Liu Zhongyi has visited both Bangkok and the border in recent weeks to arrange the repatriation.Thousands rescued from illegal scam compounds in Myanmar as Thailand launches huge crackdownRead moreThe Chinese gangs linked to scam operations in Myanmar were also believed to be linked to similar operations in Cambodia, Thatchai said. Such criminal operations have spread in areas of the region where governance is weak.The repatriation has placed a significant burden on Thailand, which faces the challenge of transporting and temporarily accommodating groups, said Thatchai. Some embassies have not yet committed to funding the repatriation of their nationals.Explore more on these topicsThailandMyanmarAsia PacificSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

It was obviously very disconcerting for the airlines involved in Trans-Tasman flights.”Marles said while Wong raised the issue of the insufficient notice period directly with Wang Yi, the government had additionally raised it with China through Canberra and Beijing channels.The New Zealand defence minister, Judith Collins, said the drills were the “most significant and sophisticated” seen in the region.The Australian and New Zealand military had been monitoring the three People’s Liberation Army-Navy vessels – the Jiangkai-class frigate Hengyang, the Renhai-class cruiser Zunyi and the Fuchi-class replenishment vessel Weishanhu – off the Australian coast for at least a week.The flotilla was about 340 nautical miles or 640km off Eden, on the New South Wales south coast, in international waters, when it notified of the drill.A NZ navy vessel shadowing the flotilla observed the ships change formation and place a target in the water, manoeuvre again and then recover the target. No surface-to-air firing or live fire was observed but the change in formation was consistent with a live-fire drill.Qantas, Emirates and Air New Zealand modified flight paths between Australia and New Zealand after receiving reports of live fire in international waters.China advised of the drill by a verbal radio broadcast on civilian channels, a Defence spokesperson said in a statement.“[China] did not inform Defence of its intent to conduct a live-fire activity and has not provided any further information,” the statement read.“That formation has now reverted to normal, indicating that the live-fire activity has most likely ceased … no weapon firings were heard or seen; however, a floating surface firing target was deployed by [China] and subsequently recovered.”Albanese’s appearance on Abbie Chatfield’s podcast was a calculated move in a tight ‘influencer election’Read moreThe incident follows an Australian air force encounter with the Chinese military last week, when a Chinese fighter jet released flares in front of an RAAF surveillance aircraft during a patrol in international airspace over the South China Sea.The flares had come within 30m of the RAAF plane.Marles said the encounter last week was different to Thursday’s drills, with the former involving “unsafe and unprofessional conduct in our view in relation to Chinese fast jet in the presence of an Australian P8 aircraft”.The RAAF had been acting in accordance with international law and registered concern with China about the fast-jet’s behaviour, Marles said.The presence of the Chinese vessels around Australia was “not unprecedented but it is unusual”, Marles said, and he had asked the defence force to provide correspondingly high levels of monitoring.The incidents were indicative of growing global instability, Marles said.“Whilst I don’t think these events are specifically connected, it points to the fact that we’re living in a difficult time in an uncertain environment,” Marles said. “We face the most complex, in some ways the most threatening strategic circumstances that we have faced since the end of the second world war and that’s actually what we are in many ways experiencing here.”Australian Associated Press contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsChinaPenny WongRichard MarlesnewsShareReuse this content"

The industry group Salmon Tasmania, backed by Liberal and Labor MPs, has argued the threat can be managed and called on Albanese to guarantee workers’ jobs.The prime minister’s letter citeda new scientific report by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studiesthat said recent surveys suggested skate numbers – which crashed last decade – were likely to have significantly increased over the past two years, returning to about 2014 levels. The report stressed the need for continued monitoring.Eight conservation councils led by Environment Tasmania have written to Albanese expressing “grave concern” about his commitment to introduce salmon-specific legislation. They said it would effectively override national law, undermine an ongoing review by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, and disregard Australia’s international obligations under the world heritage convention. About a third of Macquarie Harbour is included in the Tasmanian wilderness world heritage area.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe letter, seen by Guardian Australia, said the prime minister’s decision could lead to the skate being wiped out – at odds with a Plibersek promise that there would be “no new extinctions” – and that the new report showed skate numbers remained critically low and “extremely vulnerable” to an extreme weather event,such as the “inversion” event that led to mass deaths during a storm in 2019.The conservationists also argued Albanese’s plan would have ramifications beyond Tasmania. “If you introduce special legislation for Macquarie Harbour it sets a dangerous precedent that could be replicated across the country,” they said. “The last remaining refuges for many of Australia’s threatened species could be opened up for industrial interests.”Salmon company bosses also wrote to the prime minister, thanking him for his support but expressing frustration about uncertainty over when Albanese would deliver on his promise. The prime minister has said legislation would be introduced when parliament next sits, which most political observers believe is likely to mean after an upcoming federal election.The chief executives of the three companies operating in Tasmania – Tassal Group, Huon Aquaculture and Petuna Seafood – said Plibersek should immediately end a long-running reconsiderationof whether a decision 13 years ago that allowed salmon farms to expand operations in the harbour was legally sound. Failing that, they called on Albanese to put his promised “special legislation” to parliament before the election to give the industry certainty about its future.“We are ready, willing and able to lend any support necessary for the bill to be put before parliament and request this occurs urgently, prior to calling the federal election,” the chief executives said in the letter. “We also request to be consulted on the proposed content and wording of the bill as part of the drafting process.”Albanese’s office was asked for his response.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While the Liberal party holds the seat with an 8% margin, the sitting MP, Gavin Pearce, is retiring. Labor has preselected Anne Urquhart – currently a senator – to take on the Liberal candidate Mal Hingston – a defence contractor.The Coalition’s environment and fisheries spokesperson, Jonno Duniam, said Albanese’s pledge was “nothing more than a hollow commitment” unless it was implemented before the parliament changed.The fight over Macquarie Harbour has coincided with thousands of salmon dying at farms in the D’Entrecasteaux Channel, south of Hobart.The Bob Brown Foundation published photos that showed loads of dead salmon being dumped in skip bins. The state’s Environment Protection Authority said congealed salmon remains – chunks which it described as “fish oil” – had washed up on beaches on Bruny Island and Verona Sands in the Huon Valley over the past week.Salmon Tasmania’s chief executive, Luke Martin, told the ABC that there had been a bacteria outbreak in some salmon leases. He said it was a “really unique and really difficult set of circumstances” that the industry was working to address.The Bob Brown Foundation marine campaigner, Alistair Allan, said the skip bin images showed “just how cruel and disgusting factory-farmed salmon is”.“This is a huge biosecurity breach and disaster,” he said. “The EPA should shut down all these farms and investigate immediately.”The EPA said it had opened an investigation.Explore more on these topicsTasmaniaMarine lifeAnthony AlbaneseAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He’s shocked that Creative Australia would allow itself to be blind-sided by criticism of Sabsabi’s past work, and its refusal to answer predictable attacks with a nuanced conversation.“This could have all been avoided,” Bell says. “Creative Australia should have known that they would come after this work, and prepared the minister.“They could just say, ‘Actually the work’s almost 20 years old, you’re supposed to be talking about the proposal to go to Venice next year, and this so-called “leader of the terrorist group” at the time, wasn’t listed as a terrorist group until 14 years later’.”Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsThe furore began shortly after Sabsabi and curator Michael Dagostino’s selection was announced on 7 February, when Yoni Bashan, a columnist at The Australian, received a “flurry of messages”. Bashan’s background was in crime and business reporting, and last year was given the Sir Keith Murdoch award by his employer for his reporting of the conflict in Gaza, where he was embedded with the Israel Defense Forces.According to The Australian’s daily news podcast, the tip-offs drew Bashan’s attention to the “really unusual decision” byCreative Australia to award the prestigious spotto Sabsabi. Sabsabi’s selection was the result of the same process that saw Archie Moore win the prestigious Gold Lion at last year’s biennale, but Bashan had little familiarity with Sabsabi or Creative Australia — which he has described on the podcast as “another obscure government agency amply funded with millions and millions of taxpayer funds”.View image in fullscreenWestern Sydney artist Khaled Sabsabi (right) with curator Michael Dagostino.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The Guardian“I’m not an arts reporter, I write business gossip in The Australian. This is all a bit too flutey for me, this sort of stuff,” Bashan said on the podcast.Bashan said that when he first investigated Sabsabi’s work, including a 2007 video work entitled You, he found it “a little bit ambiguous” whether the art was in support of Hassan Nasrallah, the now deceased leader of the terrorist group Hezbollah, or not.It didn’t matter.“I’m a journalist. I’m not an arts patron. Me as the writer, as the journo, it’s not for me to figure out or solve the mystery of what Khaled Sabsabi thinks about Hassan Nasrallah.”As the starting point of a media and political storm that has upturned Australia’s art world, this incuriosity would become a defining theme. In the Senate last Thursday, Liberal senator Claire Chandler reduced Sabsabi, an artist with a complex, decades-long body of work, to “a person who highlights a terrorist leader in his artwork”.Albanese’s appearance on Abbie Chatfield’s podcast was a calculated move in a tight ‘influencer election’Read moreWithin hours, Sabsabi and Dagostino had been dropped by the board of Creative Australia.Elizabeth Ann Macgregor, who headed Sydney’s Museum of ContemporaryArt(MCA) at the time it acquired You, says the debate has ignored the original context and impact of his work.“You cannot judge a work of art by a few images online I’m afraid, that’s the nature of art,” Macgregor told the ABC this week.“Once people have the opportunity in a gallery to see the work in its full context and indeed to see other works by the same artist … they very rarely jump down your throat about it.”You was displayed at the MCA for three months in the 2009 exhibition Making it New: Focus on contemporary Australian art, where between 8 September and 11 November a total of 61,276 people visited the exhibition.View image in fullscreen‘No one attacked him at the time, particularly, when he did that work – so why now?,’ artist and curator Djon Mundine says.Photograph: Carly Earl/The GuardianThose 61,276 people could have read the accompanying panel, which drew attention to the “purposefully ambiguous” depiction of the “spiritual and political leader”. Prophetically, the text explained that You was a comment on how media coverage can turn people into heroes or villains and “its ability to generate suspicion or panic through the intensive repetition of imagery on our television screens, day in and day out”.Djon Mundine, Bundjalung artist, curator and recipient of the Australia Council’s Red Ochre lifetime achievement award in 2020, was first exposed to Sabsabi’s work over a decade ago while working at the Campbelltown Arts Centre, where You was on display in a group show with other artists from Western Sydney.“I thought the artwork was actually a great piece of work, it was the first time I’d seen digitally manipulated imagery, really,” Mundine says.The apparent “charisma” of Nasrallah’s portrayal was created in a time where positive representations of Lebanese people in Australia’s public sphere were rare, he added: “There wouldn’t have been a lot of Lebanese heroes you would have found in Sydney, not many teachers or artists.”Like Bell, Mundine also notes that the wider Hezbollah organisation was not proscribed as a terrorist group by Australia until 2021 (the Australian government had, however, listed its External Security Organisation military wing as a terrorist organisation in 2003).Nasrallah was killed in Septemberlast year by an Israeli strike on southern Lebanon. His funeral is scheduled for 23 February.But not every viewer agreed with Mundine’s interpretation.A piece published by online journal Memoon Thursday quoted Western Sydney University academic Cecelia Cmielewski, who viewed You as a critique of Nasrallah, interpreting the venerating light as “laser beams of hate”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Within a few months, Bush had launched a series of military responses, from Afghanistan to Iraq, that would have a profound impact on members of the Arab diaspora around the western world, Sabsabi included.“It’s a quote from George Bush, yes,” Macgregor said. “So it’s irony.”“So when you read that, you know, you get a shiver – but that often is the point with art. You have an initial reaction, and then you have a chance to see it. And you often have a chance to be in a gallery, where there are people to talk about it.”Labor hasn’t delivered on more effective nature laws. It’s not just embarrassing, it’s calamitous | Tim WintonRead moreFor Mundine, You became the start of a long relationship with Sabsabi, whose work has evolved to explore more conceptual and spiritual themes, and a diverse range of mediums including choirs and live performance.“My conversations with him were about somebody who is into Sufism, and he has always been this quite peaceful person. But we also talked about football teams … he’s just a good bloke, that’s all.”At the time, the work inspired no backlash in either the media or the art world.“No one attacked him at the time, particularly, when he did that work – so why now?” Mundine says.Mundine was thrilled to hear of Sabsabi and Dagostino’s selection and, like Bell, was shocked by Creative Australia’s “cowardly” reversal days later.“It showed a very clumsy handling of the whole thing,” he said. “They should have been aware of some of this, that he’d be immediately attacked.”Over at The Australian,the reluctant art critics who launched the attack on Sabsabi’s selection continue to show little interest in the complexities of his work. Reflecting on his depiction of Nasrallah, the column has since declared that, “if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, then it’s probably outright hero worship.”For Bell, the fact that a few words from two journalists was enough to make Creative Australia’s leadership abandon Sabsabi, Australia’s art community, and the complex nature of art itself, remains inexplicable.“Virtually the whole of the art world, the Australian art world, they’ve rallied behind Khaled,” he says. “And yet that counts for nothing.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsArtVenice BiennalenewsShareReuse this content"

I therefore took the immediate decision to cancel my speech that had been scheduled this afternoon.”The National Rally partywas bestedin France’ssnap electionlast summer by a leftwing alliance.Bannon on Thursday night fired up the CPAC crowd, where he spoke directly after Musk, the man who has eclipsed him in Trump’s circle and with whom Bannon isnot on good terms.“The only way that they win is if we retreat, and we are not going to retreat, we’re not going to surrender, we are not going to quit – we’re going to fight, fight, fight,” Bannon said of opponents, echoing Trump’sexhortation to supportersfollowing theassassination attempton him.Bannon then flung out his right arm at an angle with his palm pointing down. The Nazi salute is perhaps more familiar, especially from historical footage ofAdolf Hitler, with the arm pointing straight forward – but the fascist overtone of Bannonand Musk’s signalshas been unmistakable.The Anti-Defamation League, which campaigns against antisemitism,definesthe Nazi salute as “raising an outstretched right arm with the palm down”.“Steve Bannon’s long and disturbing history of stoking antisemitism and hate, threatening violence, and empowering extremists is well known and well documented by ADL and others,” the Anti-Defamation League wrote on X in response, adding: “We are not surprised, but are concerned about the normalization of this behavior.”Bannon, speaking to a French journalist from Le Point news magazine on Friday, said the gesture was not a Nazi salute but was “a wave like I did all the time”.“I do it at the end of all of my speeches to thank the crowd,” Bannon said.However, from video, when he shoots his arm in the brief, straight-arm gesture, then nods sharply with a smile, to audience cheers, and says “amen”, it looks distinctly different from the very end of his address, when Bannon walked about the stage saluting the audience, throwing first his right arm out, then his left arm out, in a looser gesture that looked much more like conventional post-speech acknowledgment of a crowd.Online, some far-right users suggested Bannon had made the gesture purposely to “trigger” liberals and the media. Others distanced themselves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some rightwing supporters have argued, without evidence, that the Roman salute originated in ancient Rome.Historians have found, instead, that it was adopted by the Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini in the 1920s, and then Hitler’s Nazi party in Germany.However the ADL concluded that in that group’s view Musk had “made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute”.Trump administration’s mass firings could leave federal government with ‘monumental’ bill, say expertsRead moreThe Bannon speech showcasedCPAC’s evolutionfrom a traditional conservative conference to an all-out Trump-centric rally. Bannon also spoke about the forthcoming election in 2028, prompting cheers of “We want Trump,” and saying himself: “We want Trump in 28.”The statement echoed those of Trump himself, who on Wednesday asked a crowd if he should run again, was met with calls of “four more years”, and called himself a “KING” in a post on social media. US presidents are limited to two terms.Meanwhile, Musk on Thursday brandished a chainsaw at CPAC, gloating over theslashing of federal jobshe is overseeing across multiple departments, in the face of legal challenges and protests. He called it “the chainsaw for bureaucracy”.It was handed to him on stage by Argentina’s rightwing president,Javier Milei.Explore more on these topicsSteve BannonFar right (US)The far rightMarylandDonald TrumpTrump administrationElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Macron is a friend of mine, and I’ve met with the prime minister, he’s a very nice guy … [but] nobody’s done anything,” he told Fox News.Trump is tearing up the transatlantic alliance. Can Starmer’s US visit change the weather?Read moreHis comments came amid mounting condemnation among European leaders over his assertions that Zelenskyy is a dictator and that Ukraine began the war in 2022.Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, called Trump’s statements “wrong and dangerous”, while Zelenskyy himself accused the US president ofliving in a “disinformation bubble”.With transatlantic relations at a low, Starmer and Macron will travel to Washington next week for talks that they hope will help determine the fate of an independent Ukraine.While Macron has promised to give a blunt message to Trump about the risk of looking weak in the face of Putin, Starmer is hoping to defuse the row, including by avoiding direct reference to the president’s recent comments.One British official said: “We want to focus on the future rather than relitigating any of the disputes there have been in recent days. If the president asks our view then we will give it, in line with statements we have made. But it is always better to focus on the future rather than trying to go over arguments of the past.”Starmer’s trip comes as European leaders express alarm at having been left out of talks between the US and Russia, and at the tone of Trump’s recent remarks about Ukraine.The US president has wrongly accused Ukraine of having started the war, and warned this week in alengthy social media post: “Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a country left.”Keith Kellogg, Trump’s Ukraine envoy, sought to soften the tone on Friday,calling Zelenskyy “the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war”. But western officials worry that the vitriol of the president’s comments this week has left the pro-Ukrainian alliance of western democracies all but dead.Macron said on Thursday he would take a tough tone with the American president, warning Trump not to embolden China. “I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of President Putin. It’s not you, it’s not what you’re made of and it’s not in your interests,”the French president said.British officials indicate they will take a different tone. “Macron will be there representing the European Union,” said one. “Our role is slightly different – we want to play a bridging role between the US and Europe.”The comments reflect Starmer’s broader approach to dealing with Trump, which has been to avoid commenting on his frequent controversies and focus instead on the goals of protecting Ukraine and avoiding trade tariffs.That approach will be tested on Monday when the UK imposes new sanctions against Russia and faces a clash at the UN over whether to accuse the Russians of having invaded Ukraine.Officials say Starmer will bring up trade during his visit to the White House, arguing their countries should increase bilateral trade rather than being squeezed by new barriers.Downing Street has been encouraged that Trump has so far left Britain off the list of countries on which he is imposing tariffs, and by thewarm wordshe has used about the bilateral relationship and Starmer in particular.The prime minister will hope to use that goodwill to persuade Trump to offer air, communications and logistical support to any European troops who are deployed to protect a peace deal in Ukraine. Starmer has said the UK would be willing to offer soldiers towards a European force, but that any such deployment would becontingent on a US “backstop”to keep it safe.The prime minister will also point to his manifesto commitment to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, but officials say he is not planning to make any announcements about when or how his government will hit that target.John Healey, the defence secretary, will lay out the timetable to reach 2.5% as part of astrategic defence review later this spring, but Downing Street is resisting pressure from some in the military to increase the target further.While the prime minister hopes his diplomatic approach will help him cut through where others have failed, some are urging him to be more direct.HR McMaster, one of Trump’s national security advisers during his first term, said on Friday: “The Europeans need to come out with a clear message: ‘Whatever you do, do not give Putin what he wants upfront.’“What does he want upfront? Sanctions relief. Keep him backed into the damned corner.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsKeir StarmerDonald TrumpUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

No. But if the question is ‘is he in danger of death?’, the answer is [also] ‘no’,” Alfieri said, adding that the pope was aware of how serious the situation was. “The pope knows this. He said: ‘I realise that the situation is serious’,” he said.Francis was admitted to hospital last Friday after suffering from what he said was bronchitis for more than a week. He was later diagnosed witha respiratory tract infection and pneumoniaon both lungs,a combination which doctors said made his therapeutic treatment more complex.The pope was “in good humour”, Alfieri said, and on Friday visited the hospital’s chapel to pray. He was also able to do some work, but his health condition could “change day to day” so he would remain in hospital for the whole of next week at least.The pope was taking a “significant” medication load and would not be discharged until he was fully out of the woods, because if he returned home, he would just start working again, said Alfieri. “We need to focus on getting through this phase … the pope is not a person who gives up.”View image in fullscreenSergio Alfieri, a general surgeon at Gemelli University hospital in Rome, told reporters the pope was ‘in good humour’.Photograph: Giuseppe Lami/EPAAlfieri said the pope was “a fragile patient” given his previous health concerns. However, he stressed that the pontiff was “not attached to any machinery” and when he needed to, he put on the nasal cannula “for a little oxygen”, but otherwise he “breathes spontaneously and feeds himself”.He said the pope did not have sepsis, a potentially life-threatening condition when a body responds to an infection by harming its own tissue and organs. However, he said there was always a risk that the infection could spread.Francis had part of his lung removed in his early 20s while he was training to be a priest in his native Argentina.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Days before an election in which the far right is expected to catapult into second place in Germany’s parliament, the simultaneous rallies in 50 municipalities were billed as a show of strength by an LGBTQ+ community as people braced for what might lie ahead.“Many queer people are unsettled by the social and political situation,” the organisers of the mid-February, cross-country initiative wrote ontheir website. “The tone against us is getting harsher, and liberal democracy is under pressure.”For years, rights campaigners have come up against the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) andits oppositionto marriage equality, safe community spaces and access to healthcare and reproductive justice.Sunday’s election, however, could leave the LGBTQ+ community grappling with an intensified challenge as polls suggest support for the AfD is set to double, yielding a result that would be unprecedented in the country’s postwar history.Alva Träbert, a board member of Germany’s LGBTQ+ umbrella group LSVD and Federation Queer Diversity, said: “We are looking at political actors openly including anti-queer and anti-trans policy in their campaigns as part of a larger effort to scapegoat marginalised groups for bigger social issues, while simultaneously legitimising discrimination and hate towards them.”The AfD’s manifesto for the upcoming election defines family as a “father, mother and children”, to the exclusion of all other forms of families. It calls for minors to be protected from what it describes as “the trans cult, early sexualisation and gender ideology”.In recent years, assupport has surgedfor the far right, the impact has been palpable: campaigners said they were aware of at least 26 attacks by far-right protesters on Pride marches last year. Träbert said in an email: “As heartbreaking and frightening as this development is, it is an unsurprising consequence of the proliferation and normalisation of anti-queer and anti-trans sentiment in politics and the media. We know this from our history: violence begins with words – and words become actions.”Träbert said that as the community had grappled with fear and uncertainty, it had been met with love and support from some quarters, with people travelling across Germany to attend Pride events in person, and others becoming activists for the first time.In the lead-up to Sunday’s elections,polls suggestthe conservative CDU-CSU bloc could emerge as the most-voted party, with about 28% of the vote, followed by the AfD.While the conservative opposition leader, Friedrich Merz, has ruled out any formal cooperation with the AfD, herecently leanedon the party to support a non-binding resolution on border policy, marking a historic breach of a taboo.His willingness to do so added to concerns about the influence of the AfD, said Träbert. “Over the past months, it has been increasingly concerning to see more centrist parties aiming to win back the electorate by appropriating the AfD’s talking points and policies.”Both Merz’s party and the AfD have vowed to revoke theself-determination law, which took effect last November and made it easierfor people to reflect their preferred names and gender on official records. The shared promise posed a “serious threat” to transgender, non-binary and intersex people, Träbert said.The far right’s consistent efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights seemingly contradicts its candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, a lesbian woman who is raising two sons with her Sri Lankan-born wife.“I would say Alice Weidel serves as a kind of fig leaf,” said Constantin Wurthmann, a political scientist at the University of Mannheim. “Because if you say the AfD is racist, you can point to Alice Weidel’s partner who is not white.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I would say that while she has this sexual orientation, she doesn’t share the identity of the community at all.”The AfD did not reply to a request for comment. Speaking to the Financial Times earlier this year, one senior AfD officialsought to explain the paradoxin this way: “She is just gay by biology, but not by political conviction.”In recent months Weidel has courted allies known for their strong stance against LGBTQ+ rights, from Elon Musk,who blamed“the woke mind virus” for his transgender daughter Vivian’s transition; to Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who last yearwas accusedof using a “machinery of fear” to attack the LGBTQ+ community.The apparent contradictions were put to Weidel earlier this month when she visited Budapest to meet Orbán. In an open letter, the Labrisz Lesbian Association, one of the co-founders of the Budapest Pride parade, laid bare what it meant to be LGBTQ+ in Orbán’s Hungary.The letter said:“Welcome to a country where lesbians cannot participate in artificial insemination programmes, cannot adopt children, and if they already have children, only one of them can exercise parental rights.”The association contrasted the situation with Orbán’s reception of the AfD. “Orbán and his homophobic comrades, with their political interests in mind, will no doubt discreetly excuse you for being a lesbian. Orbán will certainly not lecture you that you are unfit to bring up children and that you are corrupting your children. And you will discreetly not think of your partner and two children while smiling into the cameras as you shake hands with Orbán.”The letter finished with a query, echoing the question that had been asked across Hungary, Germany and beyond after the AfD’s announcement of Weidel’s visit to Budapest. “Dear Alice Weidel, what message are you sending to Hungarian lesbians with your visit?”Explore more on these topicsGermanyThe far rightEuropeLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

These two innocent children were taken hostage alive, along with their mother, Shiri, from their home on 7 October 2023,” IDF spokesperson Rear Adm.

However, Hadari says those claims are lies, that Ariel and Kfir Bibas were “murdered in cold blood”.Hagari adds:The terrorists did not shoot the two young boys – they killed them with their bare hands. Afterwards, they committed horrific acts to cover up these atrocities. This assessment is based on forensic findings and intelligence that supports these conclusions. We have shared this intelligence and the forensic findings with our partners around the world so they can verify it.The entire world must know exactly how the Hamas terrorist organization operates. Ariel and Kfir were murdered, and then yesterday, their bodies were returned in a cynical and cruel ceremony in Gaza. Shiri Bibas, who was meant to be returned with her children to Israel as part of the agreement, was not returned by Hamas. Hamas lied and violated the agreement.The body that Hamas falsely claimed was Shiri’s was not hers, nor was it any other hostage. Instead, Hamas sent over the body of an unidentified woman. This is yet more evidence of Hamas’s barbaric cruelty.”Hagari says Israel demands that Shiri Bibas be returned to Israel swiftly.It is worth noting thatIsrael’s claimshave yet to be verified by independent sources.ShareUpdated at10.43 EST"

There was no immediate comment from the militant group on the IDF’s allegation.The remains of the Bibas children, 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz, and a fourth unidentified person who was supposed to be Shiri Bibas, were handed over to Israel on Thursday as part of the first stage of a fragile ceasefire agreement.1:35Israel demands return of Shiri Bibas’s body as Hamas claims it is mixed with other remains – videoHamas said Shiri’s body had been “mistakenly mixed” with others who were killed and buried under the rubble inGaza, after the Israeli military said DNA testing showed the woman’s body released was not Shiri Bibas or any other hostage.Hamas said it was investigating the issue and, late on Friday, released another body to the Red Cross, claiming that it was that of Shiri Babas. Israeli medical authorities said forensic teams were preparing to examine the body.Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, was quick to capitalise on the crisis, accusing Hamas of breaking the truce’s terms. “We will work with determination to bring Shiri home together with all our hostages – both living and dead – and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and malicious violation of the agreement,” he said in a statement.However, relatives of the family have accused the Israeli leader of abandoning their loved ones. They also warned against using their fate as a pretext for a return to fighting amid uncertainty over implementation of the next phase of the deal, which is due to begin in early March.In the second stage, Hamas is supposed to return the remainder of the hostages in exchange for Israel ending the war, but Netanyahu has long resisted pressure to end the hostilities: much of his far-right coalition government opposes such a step if it leaves Hamas as a significant force inside the Gaza Strip. The third phase is supposed to address the exchange of bodies, a reconstruction plan for Gaza and future governance.“It was Israel’s responsibility and obligation to bring them back alive,” said Shiri’s sister-in-law, Ofri Bibas, in a statement released on behalf of the family through the Israeli campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.“Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, we did not receive an apology from you in this painful moment.“Our painful journey, which has already lasted 16 months, is not over. We are still waiting for Shiri … For Ariel and Kfir’s sake, and for Yarden’s sake, we are not seeking revenge right now. We are asking for Shiri.“Their cruelty only emphasises the urgent need to bring Shiri back to us, save the lives of the living hostages and return all the fallen for burial,” she said.The truce in the war in Gaza came into effect on 19 January, pausing 15 months of brutal fighting that killed about 48,000 Palestinians and triggered a devastating humanitarian crisis. About 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas attack that ignited the war, and 250 were taken hostage.On Friday, Hamas released the names of the six living hostages it plans to release at the weekend under the terms of the ceasefire. The Palestinian prisoners media office said more than 600 Palestinian prisoners were also to be freed.The announcements are a sign that the fragile deal remains on track despite the tensions caused by the furore surrounding the Bibas’s fate.Also on Friday, Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said he had ordered the country’s military to ramp up its operations in the occupied West Bank after a series of bus explosions near Tel Aviv the previous day. There were no casualties in the blasts, which a group identifying itself as a branch of Hamas’ military wing, al-Qassam Brigades, from the West Bank city of Tulkarem, stopped short of taking responsibility for in a Telegram post.Israel’s latest operation in the West Bank, launched immediately after the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, has wreaked widespread damage, killed more than 50 Palestinians, caused thousands to flee their homes and ripped up roads and infrastructure in refugee camps.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaHamasBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The programme will not be available on iPlayer while this is taking place.”The BBC had initially said it would “add some more detail to the film” and leave it available to view on catch-up services. But the escalating pressure prompted executives to take firmer action.Critics of the programme, led by the former BBC One controller Danny Cohen, are asking whether the BBC paid any member of Hamas – a banned terrorist organisation in the UK – as part of the filming of the documentary, which aired on BBC2 on Monday night.Cohen said on Friday that the “documentary fails the most basic of programme standards” because “links to the terrorist group Hamas were not disclosed” and said that “it appears that children have been manipulated by terrorists”.Based on nine months of observational footage filmed in the run-up to last month’s ceasefire, three of the documentary’s main characters are children. It was produced by an independent company, Hoyo films.The day after transmission, the activist and journalist David Collier revealed that the 14-year-old English-speaking narrator, Abdullah, was the son of a Hamas deputy minister for agriculture, Ayman al-Yazouri.Collier described Abdullah “as the child of Hamas royalty” and pointed out his family connection to the group was not explained in the programme. Yazouri’s profile on LinkedIn says he helps “supervise, facilitate and support agricultural activities in Gaza Strip”.At the beginning of the film, Abdullah, then 13, asks viewers: “Have you ever wondered what you’d do if your world is destroyed?” He continues: “Most important, could you stay alive? After all this, you could say we’re experts.”The International Centre of Justice for Palestinians criticised the concerns raised, and urged the BBC to “stand firm against these attempts to prevent first-hand accounts of life in Gaza from reaching audiences”.A statement from the London-based organisation said: “For some, almost any Palestinian perspective appears to be deemed unacceptable. In this case, objections have been raised because Abdullah’s father holds a government role in Gaza’s Hamas-run administration. However, this does not negate the child’s lived experience or invalidate his testimony.”The documentary features Palestinians criticising Hamas on several occasions, and has been praised for its close-up observational style intended to humanise the situation in the territory.After Collier’s criticism, 45 prominent Jewish journalists and members of the media signed a letter demanding the programme be taken down. Signatories included Cohen, the former BBC governor Ruth Deech, the Friday Night Dinner and EastEnders actor Tracy-Ann Oberman and the Strike producer Neil Blair.“Given the serious nature of these concerns, the BBC should immediately postpone any broadcast repeats of the programme, remove it from iPlayer and take down any social media clips of the programme until an independent investigation is carried out and its findings published with full transparency for licence-fee payers,” the letter said.The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, has said she will talk to the BBC about “the way in which they sourced the people who were featured in the programme”. Allies said she intended to raise the topic as part of her routine engagement with the broadcaster.Nandy said: “These things are difficult and I do want to acknowledge that the BBC take more care than most broadcasters … They’ve been attacked for being too pro-Gaza, they’ve been attacked for being anti-Gaza.”Explore more on these topicsBBCGazaMiddle East and north AfricaTelevisionIsrael-Gaza warHamasPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

However, it added: “During the identification process, it was determined that the additional body received is not that of Shiri Bibas, and no match was found for any other hostage.”Hamas offers handover of all hostages to Israel if next phase of ceasefire agreedRead moreThe development threatens to derail the fragile ceasefire agreement reached with US backing and with the help of Qatari and Egyptian mediators last month. Thursday’s release marked the first time the group has returned the remains of dead hostages.AHamasofficial told Agence France-Presse on Friday that it was likely the body of Bibas had been “mistakenly mixed” with others who were killed and buried under the rubble in Gaza. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, added that the group was “investigating” the issue.Israel’s army said it had notified the family, including Yarden Bibas, Shiri’s husband and the boys’ father, who was released this month as part of the truce deal. It added that intelligence and forensic findings showed that Bibas’s children had been “murdered by terrorists”. Hamas has said the boys and their mother were killed in an Israeli bombing in November 2023.Bibas and her children became a symbol of the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023 that ignited the war inGaza. The identity of the fourth hostage’s body, that of 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz, was confirmed by forensic testing, his family said.0:47Netanyahu says Hamas will pay for not returning Shiri Bibas – videoIsrael’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been quick to inflame other crises in the war, said on Friday that Hamas had handed over the body of a “Gazan woman” instead of Bibas and that Israel would make Hamas pay.“In an unimaginably cynical manner, they did not return Shiri to her small children, the little angels, and instead placed the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin,” Netanyahu said in a video statement. “We will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages – both living and dead – and ensure Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement.”Morgues in Gaza began overflowing early in the war, which has killed about 48,000 people. During the fighting, many of the dead were buried in mass graves with the intention of holding dignified funerals and moving bodies to graveyards when the situation was safer. About 1,200 people were killed in the 7 October attack, and another 250 taken hostage.Friday’s statement came hours after Netanyahu ordered the military to conduct an “intense operation” against “terror hubs” in the occupied West Bank after aseries of explosions on three parked busesin Bat Yam, a city outside Tel Aviv, that authorities said was a suspected terrorist attack. No injuries were reported.Explosives were found on two other buses but did not detonate, the police spokesperson Asi Aharoni told Channel 13 TV. Israeli police said the five bombs were identical and equipped with timers, and bomb squads were defusing the unexploded ones.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosions.View image in fullscreenShiri Bibas with her son Kfir.Photograph: Family handout/PAIsrael has been carrying out intensified raids on the occupied West Bank since October 2023, killing hundreds of people. At least 51 Palestinians including seven children have been killed an a crackdown on the northern West Bank launched by Israel after the Gaza ceasefire went into effect on 19 January,according to the UN.Thursday’s handover of bodies is to be followed by the return of six living hostages on Saturday, in exchange for hundreds more Palestinian prisoners and detainees, expected to be women and minors detained by Israeli forces in Gaza.Negotiations for a second phase, expected to cover the return of about 60 remaining hostages, less than half of whom are believed to be alive, and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip, are expected to begin in the coming days.Netanyahu has long resisted talks aimed at ending the war: much of his far-right coalition government opposes such a step if it leaves Hamas as a significant force inside the strip.News agencies contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaHamasIsraelWest BankPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

McDonald’s responded by saying it was “not funding or supporting any governments involved in this conflict, and any actions from our local development licensee business partners were made independently without McDonald’s consent or approval”.Sales nonetheless dropped in Muslim-majority countries and McDonald’s bought back the franchises from Alonyal in April 2024, saying it was “committed to the Israeli market and to ensuring a positive employee and customer experience going forward”.While the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement does not name McDonald’s as one of its central targets for consumer boycott, it continues to support the broader “organic boycott” movement against the company.Stormzy is a vocal supporter of Palestine. In an Instagram post after the outbreak of the October 2023 conflict, he wrote: “Free Palestine … if there is ever a clear injustice in the world, no matter how big or small 100 times out of 100 I will be on the side of the oppressed.”He also performed at a benefit concert for causes in Palestine and Sudan in January 2024.The “Free Palestine” post is no longer visible on Instagram, and in his statement, published via his Instagram stories, Stormzy denied it was removed because of the criticism of his McDonald’s campaign.“I didn’t archive the post where I came out in support of Palestine for any reason outside of me archiving loads of [Instagram] posts last year,” he said. “In that post, I spoke about #FreePalestine, oppression and injustice and my stance on this has not changed.”He added: “The brands I work with can’t tell me what to do and don’t tell me what to do otherwise I wouldn’t work with them. I do my own research on all brands I work with, gather my own information, form my own opinion and come to my own conclusion before doing business.”Stormzy said he knew he had supporters “who are genuinely confused and hurt by what they think has happened … I understand it must feel disappointing and disheartening when it seems like someone you’ve championed has compromised their beliefs for commercial gain but this isn’t the case here”.The Guardian has contacted McDonald’s for comment.Among those criticising Stormzy for his McDonald’s partnership was Jeremy Corbyn’s Peace & Justice Project, which said on its website that the campaign allowed McDonald’s “to culture-wash their reputation”.Having announced festival shows in the summer, Stormzy is expected to release new music in the coming months: likely an album to follow his three previous chart-topping LPs. The most recent, This Is What I Mean, was released in November 2022.Since then he has topped the singles chart with Backbone, a collaboration with Chase and Status, and released collaborative tracks with Fredo, Raye and AP Dhillon.Explore more on these topicsStormzyMcDonald'sIsraelPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The materials were corrected, and we closed the matter with no further action based on all the evidence we had at the time.“However, we’ve now become aware of further information, so we will look at this.”The spokesperson would not say why the regulator had changed its position since Wednesday.The decision came after Robert Jenrick wrote to the SRA demanding a new inquiry. The shadow justice secretary earlier this week accused Reynolds of “criminal conduct” and called on the prime minister, Keir Starmer, to sack him.ALabourspokesperson said: “Jonathan looks forward to engaging fully with the Solicitors Regulation Authority and drawing a line under the matter.”Reynolds trained as a solicitor but left before finishing his training contract to run for parliament in 2010.In recent days he has come under pressure to explain why he referred to himself as a solicitor, not only on his LinkedIn page but also on a previous version of his website and in the Commons. He told MPs in 2014 he had “worked as a solicitor in Manchester city centre”.Diana Johnson, a Home Office minister, said this week that the errors on Reynolds’ LinkedIn profile had been “mistakes made by administrative staff”. Neither Labour nor Reynolds have commented on why he referred to himself as a solicitor in the Commons.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has also had tocorrect her LinkedIn profileafter it said she had been an economist at the bank HBOS when she actually worked in retail banking. Her profile also said she had worked for the Bank of England until December 2006, when she had left in March that year.Explore more on these topicsJonathan ReynoldsLabourSolicitorsRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

Whether it’s in our NHS, our economy, or our schools the SNP is taking Scotland in the wrong direction.”Sarwar promised that Scottish Labour would reverse the SNP’s longstanding ban on new nuclear power stations to support new jobs and secure baseload energy as part of its pursuit of clean energy.He claimed Labour would also end rough sleeping, which had cost 242 lives last year, by ensuring there was enough emergency hostel spaces. Labour sources said they would draw on experience in Manchester, where the council focused on helping persistent rough sleepers.Labour would also ban mobile phones in classrooms, without breaching health or disability equalities rights, because of the scourge of cyber-bullying and mobile phone-fuelled violence in playgrounds, he said.On health policy, he said family doctors would be required to see all patients within 48 hours, with people able to use apps to book appointments, after a rewriting of the GP contract.Most of Scotland’s 50 health boards would be merged, and Scottish ministers would make greater use of English hospitals and private providers to cut waiting lists – a reform close to NHS policy in England and Wales. “Under our plans, the money will follow the patient,” he said.A recent decision by the Scottish governmentto reinstate peak fares on domestic rail serviceswould be reversed, while Labour would also reform local government by allowing regions to elect mayors on the English model.He said John Swinney’s SNP government “have had their chance”.“If they were going to fix the problems, they would have done it by now,” Sarwar said. “The fact is every institution is weaker after 18 years of the SNP in government and they have squandered the opportunity Scotland gave them.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandAnas SarwarnewsShareReuse this content"

Polling consistently shows the US president is deeply unpopular with British voters, a majority of whom think ministers should now prioritise building bridges with the EU over the US.A YouGov poll this week suggested half of voters thought it was in the UK’s interest to stand up to Trump and criticise his actions, compared with 30% who thought it better to build a positive relationship and refrain from criticism.Voters’ desire to see Starmer channel Hugh Grant rebuking the fictional president inLove Actuallyreflects how unpopular Trump is in the UK. A More in Common poll last month found that 59% had a negative view of Trump and just 24% had a positive one, giving him a lower approval rating than any UK politician.Meanwhile, a study by the Policy Institute at King’s College London concluded there had been a reversal of public attitudes towards the EU and US compared with 60 years ago. The study, based on a poll by Focaldata, found that 53% of voters today think Britain should prioritise Europe over the US if needed, compared with 31% who chose the US. In 1967, the public favoured America over Europe by 53% to 33%.When voters were asked by YouGovin Decemberwhy they were unhappy that Trump had won the presidential election, respondents most commonly cited his criminal record and misogynistic attitudes, but also used a range of unflattering adjectives including racist, crazy, authoritarian and dangerous.Given all this, getting tough with Trump could win Starmer – whose own approval rating has plummeted since the general election – some fans in Britain. But the prime minister is keen not to rock the boat with the world’s most powerful country and its notoriously thin-skinned president.Part of the reason has to do with potential repercussions for the British economy, given the damage that would be caused by the tariffs Trump hasthreatened to impose.Equally important is British security. When Starmer travels to Washington, he will want to gently persuade Trump not to agree a hasty ceasefire in Ukraine that favours Russia, and toprovide US air coverto any eventual western peacekeeping force in Ukraine.Starmer is not the only politician walking something of a tightrope when it comes to the US. Kemi Badenoch has sought to align herself with Trump since he won office, likening her leadership of the Conservative party to his second termat a conference last week, even though attitudes towards the US president among Tory voters are divided.Trump’s adoption of the Russian narrative on Ukraine, includingcalling Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator, put Badenoch in a difficult position and elicited a carefully worded statement in which she contradicted Trump on Zelenskyy but said he was right that European countries needed to increase defence spending.As forNigel Farage, his close links to Trump and full-throated support for his agenda play well with his voter base – Reform UK voters are the only political group who were by and large happy to see Trump re-elected as president.However, by tying himself so closely to Trump, Farage risks putting a ceiling on his support, and he has alsofaced difficult questionsafter Trump’s rapprochement with Vladimir Putin.For Ed Davey, things are pretty simple: he has been able to position himself as the major party leadermost willing to attack Trump, an approach Liberal Democrat voters are strongly in favour of. This helps Davey appeal to the large numbers of Labour and Tory voters who want to see those parties take a tougher stance.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerKemi BadenochNigel FarageEd DaveyLabourConservativesanalysisShareReuse this content"

It would also mean all data was accessible by Apple, which could share it with law enforcement if they had a warrant.Earlier this month the Home Officeserved Apple a requestunder the Investigatory Powers Act, which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies, asking for the right to see users’ encrypted data, which currently not even Apple can access.After the change at 3pm on Friday, new users had no access to the ADP tool and existing users would need to disable the security feature at a later date. Messaging services like iMessage and FaceTime would remain end-to-end encrypted by default.Apple said: “We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy. Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before.“Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the UK.As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.”Alan Woodward, from the University of Sussex, said Apple’s move was “quite an extraordinary development”. The cybersecurity professor said: “It was incredibly naive of the British government to think they could tell Apple what to do.“Unpleasant a fact of life as it may be, you simply can’t tell a large US technology company what to do. You have to work with them, [practise] diplomacy – that’s what has been tried before and was working. Waving a UK law at them was not going to work.”He said Apple was sending a message that “you cannot weaken encryption for your enemies without weakening it for your friends”, and that all the government could achieve would be to make its applications less secure for UK users, while obtaining no benefit for intelligence operations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The paper is similar but not identical to proposals being discussed by Arab foreign ministers in Riyadh, which has a strong international component and would prevent Hamas ruling in Gaza.But Starmer’s team also intend to raise the Chagos deal in which the UK pays theMauritiusgovernment for a 99-year lease on the islands, a series of atolls in the Indian Ocean that have been described as Britain’s last African colony.Why giving up the Chagos Islands could cost Britain £9bn – podcastRead moreThey will emphasise the deal was a decision based on a security assessment and not by a desire to adhere to the principles of international law, a concept that does not impress the Trump administration.Ministers havefaced criticism over the agreementto hand control of the islands to Mauritius, although it will remain under UK control for almost a century under the deal.An interim deal was agreed last year, building on work that began under the Conservative government, but after Navin Ramgoolam was re-elected as the Mauritian prime minister in November, he demanded torenegotiate the proposals.A steady stream of UK Conservatives has since been trying to persuade the Trump team to reject the deal, embarrassing the Starmer administration. The interim deal negotiated between the Labour government and the previous Mauritian administration last year was endorsed by the outgoing Biden administration.The UK recognises that the new Trump team has the right to review the deal’s implications for its base at Diego Garcia, but hope that the Pentagon officials who cleared the deal under Biden will maintain their previous support in their advice to the new defence secretary, Peter Hegseth.The UK is expecting a US decision in weeks not months, and if Trump vetoed the sale the UK would have little option but to pull out of the draft agreement with Mauritius.The UK argues that even though an international court of justice opinion in 2019 stating the islands belonged to Mauritius was advisory, it would at some stage become binding, and that would have implications for law of the sea rulings, as well as the provision of services on the island by third parties.The UK is arguing a deal struck now that the UK government is confident will last the next 100 years is seen as a better way of taking the US lease on the base out of difficult geopolitics.If no deal was struck, the UK argues the Chinese could use the legally disputed status of the islands to start building listening posts or bases on the outer islands, creating a contested security environment in the Indian Ocean analogous to the current tensions in the SouthChinaSea.Downing Street said: “The legal and security advice is very clear that the operation of the base will be at risk if there is not a deal.”The UK and Mauritius have refused so far to detail the precise cost to the British taxpayer of leasing the islands, but insist a cited £18bn figure is wrong. The deal is front loaded and parts of it are inflation indexed.The US built a military base on the strategic islands after the expulsion of the native Chagossians in the 1960s and 1970s. UK officials claim links between the Mauritian government and China are a myth, and that India is the influential regional power with Mauritius, one of the few countries in the region that has refused to take part in China’s belt and road initiative.Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsKeir StarmerDonald TrumpMauritiusForeign policyChinaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Kushner kept dodging on the formal endorsement of his father-in-law. The campaign then tried to settle for merely a statement from him that his father-in-law was not antisemitic.”According to Wolff, Kushner finally said: “No, Ivanka and I aren’t going to do that. We’re not going to go and put our names on something and get in the middle of things. That’s just not what we’re going to do this time.”Kushner and Ivanka Trump were senior advisers to Trump during his first presidency, from 2017 to 2021. But they kept their distance after his attempt to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat to Joe Biden culminated in his supporters’ January 6 attack on Congress. The couple have not taken up roles in his second administration after he won back the presidency in November at the expense of former vice-president Kamala Harris, though Kushner has beenlinkedto Trump’s controversial plans to depopulate and redevelop the Gaza strip after Israel’s relentless assault in response to 7 October.Wolff’s book, All or Nothing: How Trump Recaptured America, is his fourth on the president. The new volume was formally confirmed this week, shortly ahead of its US publication on Tuesday. The Guardian obtained a copy.Wolff’s first Trump book, Fire and Fury, was released in 2018 and sold millions as Trump tried to block it, kicking off a lucrative rush of Trump-focused books that has shown new signs of life since he won re-election.Wolff followed Fire and Fury with Siege and Landslide. Excerpts from All or Nothing have been published inVanity Fairandthe Daily Beast, the latter detailing what Wolff claims is Melania Trump’s “hatred” for her husband.Announcing All or Nothing, publisher Crown said: “Wolff’s thesis in his 18 months of covering the campaign was that the establishment would destroy Trump, or Trump would destroy the establishment. All or Nothing is Wolff’s panoramic and intimate picture of that battle … from indictments, to trials, to assassination attempts, to the humiliation and defenestration of a sitting president, to Trump’s staggering victory.”Last November, as Wolff wrote the book, a group of Trump aides including his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, said: “A number of us have received inquiries from the disgraced authorMichael Wolff, whose previous work can only be described as fiction. He is a known peddler of fake news who routinely concocts situations, conversations, and conclusions that never happened. As a group, we have decided not to respond to his bad faith inquiries, and we encourage others to completely disregard whatever nonsense he eventually publishes. Consider this our blanket response to whatever he writes.”On Friday, the Trump White House’s communications director, Steven Cheung,told the Beast: “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of shit and has been proven to be a fraud.“He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”Among other moments in All or Nothing sure to be widely discussed, Wolff reports that Trump demanded to know “what the fuck is wrong with” Elon Musk, the world’s richest person who became a key campaign backer, and called JD Vance, the vice-presidential pick over whom Wolff says Trump had grave doubts, “shifty, very shifty”.Describinga Trump rallyin Butler, Pennsylvania, in October, where Trump survivedan assassination attemptin July, Wolff writes: “And Elon is here, waiting when [Trump’s team] arrive[s], which is cause for a moment of consternation … Elon! Next only to Trump, there is Elon.”Saying aides viewed Musk as “a new, overwhelming, and discordant presence in the campaign”, generating “an ever-rising tide of bewildering, if not opaque, requests, orders, and recommendations”, Wolff said aides thought Musk had “elevated the Trump campaign in his own mind to a personal mission and religious cause”, while “the Trump circle” was “already anticipating the earth shaking when he and Trump invariably f[e]ll out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This causes a kerfuffle and results in uncertainty over how to attend to him. Someone produces a bag of pretzel sticks.“The suggestion is made that JD is here and would love to speak to him. Musk, sitting down and eating his pretzel sticks, politely declines: ‘I’ve really no interest in speaking to a vice-president.’“Later, called onstage, with no one having any idea what he might say, Musk bounds up and, suddenly – in Mick Jagger style, prancing and jumping – becomes the headline, his T-shirt rising far above his midriff.“What the fuck is wrong with this guy?” says a bewildered Trump. “And why doesn’t his shirt fit?”Elsewhere, Wolff describes Trump’s extensive second thoughts about Vance, in one instance reportedly described in a phone conversation with an unnamed confidant.“Yeah. What the fuck is with that name-change stuff?” Trump is depicted as saying. “How many name changes has he had? That’s shifty, that’s very shifty. That’s my staff fucking up. They know what I think about people changing their names. I think it’s shifty. And they didn’t tell me.”Vance was born James Donald Bowman. After his parents split up he was adopted by his new stepfather and renamed James David Hamel. Long known as “J.D.”, he later changed to his surname to Vance, after the beloved grandmother of whom he writes in Hillbilly Elegy, his bestselling book from 2016. He eventually dropped the periods, to become “JD”.Explore more on these topicsMichael WolffDonald TrumpPolitics booksRepublicansJared KushnerIvanka TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Many lawyers, including at Acacia and ImmDef, had continued to represent and work with clients despite the order, saying that absurdly leaving children without legal representation could have dire consequences and would violate the ethical codes stipulated in their legal licenses.“In the past 48 hours, people appalled by the cruelty shown to migrant children sent over 15,000 letters to Congress,”saidLindsay Toczylowski, ImmDef’s president and CEO. “They demanded that legal access for unaccompanied children be restored, and that this administration protect children in their care. We are deeply grateful for their support. Now, children across the nation won’t have to face the immediate threat.”Among the children affected by this stop-work order are those who presented themselves to officials at the border without their parents and were put under the custody of ORR. Some are in foster care or in group homes.About 50% of children have legal representation in immigration court.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Prosecutors portrayed the brothers, sons of a media executive, as motivated by greed for their multimillion-dollar inheritance. They repeatedly appealed against their convictions without success.District attorney Nathan Hochman said at a press conference on Friday that he does not believe that Erik and Lyle Menendez deserve a new trial – which they petitioned for in 2023 – and cast doubt on the evidence corroborating the testimony that the two brothers were sexually abused by their father.But he also said that he was not ready to announce whether or not his office would support a resentencing in their 1996 murder conviction, a decision that would involve more consideration of the brothers’ rehabilitation in the past 30 years in prison.“Sexual abuse is abhorrent, and we will prosecute sexual abuse in any form it comes. While sexual abuse, in this situation, may have been a motivation for Erik and Lyle to do what they did, it does not constitute self-defense,” Hochman said. Quoting a previous prosecutor on the case, he said: “Sexual abuse does not justify killing your parents.”While the brothers testified about the sexual abuse they said they had experienced, Hochman said: “When it came to any corroborating information about the sexual abuse, it was extremely lacking.”View image in fullscreenNathan Hochman, the new Los Angeles district attorney.Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/APHochman also said the brothers did not initially talk about sexual abuse in their accounts of their parents’ killing: “It was their fourth version – they didn’t come out initially and say, ‘We killed our parents because our father sexually abused us.’”California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has “unilateral” power to commute the brothers’ sentence if he chooses to do so, Hochman said. “He has that power today.”Last year, after more than three decades in prison, the brothers had seenmajor developments in their case, which had been put in the spotlight by a new documentary and a Ryan Murphy-produced Netflix series.Hochman’s announcement comes four months after the city’s previous district attorney, the more politically progressive George Gascón,recommendedthat the brothers be resentenced, a move that supporters had hoped would lead to the brothers’ release.Gascón had made clear that he supported clemency in the brothers’ case, though he reportedly saidnot every attorney in his officeagreed with him.“I do believe the brothers were subjected to a tremendous amount of dysfunction in the home, and molestation,” Gascónsaid in October. “They have been in prison for nearly 35 years. I believe that they have paid their debt to society.”Some supporters had hoped the resentencing would mean the brothers could be released from prison and home by Thanksgiving or by Christmas 2024.But the November election of Hochman, who who ran a tough-on-crime platform and ousted Gascón as district attorney, upended those expectations, as a judge in their case delayed a scheduled hearing to give Hochman more time toreview the caseand make his own recommendation.View image in fullscreenLyle Menendez and his brother Erik in court in Beverly Hills in 1990.Photograph: Nick Ut/APOn Friday, in his first public statement on the substance of the case, Hochman made clear his critical view about many aspects of the brothers’ behavior in the case, highlighting the brothers’ changing statements, their “lies”, and the brutality of the shotgun killings of their parents.In a press conference that delved heavily into legal details of the case, Hochman said, “The court should deny the current habeas petition by the two brothers,” arguing that the new evidence that they brothers had presented in 2023 was not fresh, relevant or substantive enough to merit a new trial. The district attorney’s office shared avideothey had breaking down evidence in the Menendezes’s case.Hochman said he was filing an informal response to the habeas petition urging the court to reject it.Newsomannounced in Novemberhe wouldpostpone a decisionon whether to offer the brothers clemency until the new district attorney had reviewed the case.In January, the superior court judge Michael Jesicpushed the hearingout another two months – to 20 and 21 March – because of the Los Angeles wildfires.Hochman, who took office in December, had not previously said whether he supported the proposed resentencing for the brothers, which will be taken up at the March hearing and would make them immediately eligible for parole.Menendez brothers’ 2024 saw hopes of release soar but ended in uncertaintyRead moreIn December, Bryan Freedman, an attorney who represents a group of 24 Menendez family members who support the brothers’ release, hadpublicly accusing Hochman’s office of a conflict of interest in the case, a criticism that a spokesperson for the office called “meritless”.Since then,Hochman has met with more of the brothers’ relativesas he reviews their case, which includes thousands of pages of prison records to determine the “rehabilitation aspect” of their resentencing.Most of their extended family supports the brothers’ release, andhave saidthey deserve to be free after decades behind bars. Several relatives have said that in today’s world – which is more aware of the impact of sexual abuse – the brothers would not have been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life, as they were in 1996.Lyle Menendez, who in 1989 was 21, and Erik Menendez, who was 18, admitted they fatally shot their parents, but they said they feared their parents were about to kill them to prevent disclosure of their father’s long-term molestation of Erik.Prosecutors said at the time there was no evidence of molestation, and many details in their story of sexual abuse were not permitted in the trial that led to their conviction in 1996. Prosecutors accused the brothers of killing their parents for money.In 2023, two important new pieces of evidence had surfaced in the case: a letter written by Erik before the killings that corroborated his allegations of abuse, and testimony by a former member of the boy band Menudo who said he was also abused by Jose Menendez, the brothers’ father. The brothers filed a habeas petition in response to the new evidence surfaced in 2023 challenging their convictions as unconstitutional.Last year, a new documentary, and a controversial Netflix series by Ryan Murphy, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, criticized by some family members as “grotesque shockudrama”, put the spotlight on the brothers’ story and the evidence of the abuse they had suffered. A growing number of supporters have rallied behind the brothers, including Kim Kardashian, who has called publicly for their release,writing last yearthat the brothers, now in their 50s, were not the same people they had been when they were convicted.“I have spent time with Lyle and Erik; they are not monsters,”Kardashian wrote. “They are kind, intelligent and honest men.”Dani Anguiano and the Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsCaliforniaLos AngelesWest CoastUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

In many cases it’s not true, according to employees embroiled in the blitz, many of whom are now seeking legal advice.Jacob Malcom was acting deputy assistant secretary for policy and environmental management, and director of the office of policy analysis at the US Department of the Interior – until this week, when he resigned in protest against the mass firings of probationary employees.“This is being done under the guise of ‘poor performance’ or ‘skills not aligned with needs’ but neither are true,” he told the Guardian. “First, no evidence was provided that would suggest that poor performance; in fact, I know some of the individuals that were down my chain of supervision and know they were among the best performers.“Second, [there has been] no evidence or analysis of a lack of alignment with needs. Some of the people terminated in my chain actually work on performance and efficiency, so they literally work on the public argument of the Doge.”The so-called “department of government efficiency”, a unit led by billionaire tycoonElon Musk, has been permitted by Trump to conduct a wide-ranging blitz across the federal government in the name of improving efficiency.But Suzanne Summerlin, a labor attorney, said an “astounding” level of “fraud, waste and abuse” had been occurring as theTrump administrationsought to overhaul a string of departments and agencies.“These firings they’re conducting without following the law will result in hundreds of thousands of former federal employees being owed back pay, plus interest, plus benefits, plus attorneys fees,” said Summerlin. “When the bill comes it will be monumental.”Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, said: “President Trump and his administration are delivering on the American people’s mandate to eliminate wasteful spending and make federal agencies more efficient, which includes removing probationary employees who are not mission critical.”The office of personnel management and Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment.On Thursday, a federal judge ruled against a lawsuit filed by a string of unions requesting a restraining order and preliminary injunction to block the Trump administration’s mass firings. The judge claimed the court did not have jurisdiction, and that the unions must file with the federal labor board.Thousands of the more than 220,000 probationary employees working for the federal government around the US havereceivedtermination notices in recent days as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to dramatically reduce the federal workforce.One veteran federal worker who spoke to the Guardian had only been a few weeks away from passing her one-year probationary period to be hired permanently by the US Forest Service. Instead they received a termination notice citing poor performance. They had, in fact, received positive performance reviews, a copy of which they shared with the Guardian.“I would have been a permanent employee on March 10,” they said. “I’ve lost my medical insurance. I have an incurable disease that I kind of need a doctor for. I won’t be able to pay those bills. I’m waiting for my eviction notice right now.”They were also to sign a non-disclosure agreement, seen by the Guardian, but refused. They requested to remain anonymous for fear of further retaliation toward prospective jobs.“Elon Musk destroyed 19 years of my career, it’s gone. He put a label on us. We’ve been labeled the fraud, the waste and the bloat of the government,” the worker said. “They have effectively destroyed our careers. We won’t recover from this. There’s no way. The financial fallout is catastrophic, and he’s dismantling everything. I mean, I don’t know how this helps the working man.“We’re all taxpayers here. I pay taxes, and I work my ass off for my job, despite whatever the rest of the public thinks about federal workers.”The mass terminations have caused chaos in the federal government.

Its businesses touch health technology, pharmacy benefits and physician practices.Man charged in UnitedHealthcare CEO killing to appear in Manhattan courtRead moreThe company is so large that one industry analyst estimated5% of US gross domestic productflowed through its infrastructure each day. It is the largest employer of doctors in the US with more than 90,000 physicians in 2023, or nearlyone in 10 American doctors.According to the report, the justice department is now conducting a civil fraud investigation.Medicare is a public health insurance program for the elderly and disabled that covers more than 65 million Americans. About half of those beneficiaries use Medicare Advantage plans – a program started by Congress to allow private insurers to manage beneficiaries’ care.At the time it was created, during the George W Bush administration, supporters argued private corporations would be able to more efficiently provide the same services as government and save taxpayers money.However, a raft of studies now show the program probably costs taxpayers billions more each year. A study by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (Medpac) found that in 2024 alone, Medicare Advantage plans probablycost taxpayers $83bn (22%) morethan traditional Medicare.Further, anincreasing number of patientshave complained about how the program makes it difficult to access care, for example by requiring patients to seek permission, or “prior authorization”, from insurers before treatment.The investigation into UnitedHealthcare is being carried out by the Department of Justice’s civil fraud division and the Department of Health and Human Services office of the inspector general, the journal reported. The investigation is separate from an ongoing Department of Justice antitrust inquiry.In a statement responding to the journal’s report, UnitedHealthgroup said: “The Wall Street Journal continues to report misinformation on the Medicare Advantage (MA) program. The government regularly reviews all [Medicare Advantage] plans to ensure compliance and we consistently perform at the industry’s highest levels on those reviews.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are aware, however, that the Journal has engaged in a year-long campaign to defend a legacy system that rewards volume over keeping patients healthy and addressing their underlying conditions. Any suggestion that our practices are fraudulent is outrageous and false.”The enormous company has come under scrutiny for other parts of its business as well. UnitedHealth Group owns Change Healthcare, a technology company that facilitates as much as one-third of all payments from insurers to providers. A huge data breach in 2024 allowed hackers to “exfiltrate” as many as 85m patient records – the event was described by one analyst as healthcare’s “Deepwater Horizon moment”.More scrutiny of the company was brought by the murder ofUnitedHealthcare’s CEO, Brian Thompson. The killing of the executive described as a kind family man was met withapathy and derisionfrom the American public, who described routinely being denied healthcare.UnitedHealth’s stock declined 10% in early morning trading on the news.Explore more on these topicsUS newsBrian Thompson shootingHealthcare industryUS MedicarenewsShareReuse this content"

The report of the Tesla investment proposal came after Nissan this monthcalled off the Honda merger talksafter balking at the idea of becoming a subsidiary of the larger company.The merger plans were first prompted by an approach to buy Nissan shares from Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, which produces iPhones in China for Apple.Foxconn has big ambitions to produce a large proportion of the world’s electric cars. Japan’s Nikkei newspaper reported on Friday that it had approached Honda about forming a partnership.The mootedTeslainvestment plan was reported by the Financial Times, which said the push was being led by Suga, who was Japan’s premier for a year in 2020-21, along with his former aide Hiroto Izumi and the former Tesla board member Hiro Mizuno. Several board members at Nissan were aware of the proposal, the FT said.A sale of plants could make sense for Nissan, which is in theprocess of cutting 9,000 jobs worldwideas part of its turnaround efforts. Extra US plants could help Tesla as the US president, Donald Trump, appears set on imposing tariffs on the car industry, despite his close relationship with Musk.The world’s richest man was the biggest single funder of Trump’s presidential campaign, and is running adeeply controversial effort to cut backentire US government departments for Trump.However, Musk has long said that Tesla’s manufacturing process is a key advantage over rivals in electric vehicle production, meaning taking over another carmaker’s plant may be less attractive.He has touted significant investment in Tesla’s own metal stamping and robotics, including on Tesla’s next vehicle, ataxi called the Cybercabthat is planned to be fully autonomous.Responding to a post about the report on X, the social network he owns, Musk wrote: “The Tesla factory IS the product. The Cybercab production line is like nothing else in the automotive industry.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ever since the 2008 financial crisis Berlin has sought to burnish a reputation as the world capital of fiscal discipline, with a near-pious aversion to debt and pride in strong government finances.Under a rule known as the “debt brake” – introduced in 2009 byAngela Merkelto show Germany was committed to balancing the books after the banking crash – the federal government is required to limit annual borrowing to 0.35% of GDP.Afterthis weekend’s electionsit might not be long before the constitutional handbrake is relaxed to help reboot Europe’s largest economy with debt-funded firepower, and to find room for higher defence spending.“It is seismic. We are about to take a new direction in the economic policies ofEurope,” said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at the ING bank.“Back then [2009] the German approach [to sustainable public finances] was one completely ignoring growth, trying to lead by example with the debt brake. Now we see Germany paying the price for having fiscal rules that were too simplistically looking at the public finances and not growth.”All eyes on far-right AfD in German election rocked by violence and US interferenceRead moreGermans will vote on Sunday in a snap general election, after last November’scollapse of the “traffic light” coalitionled by chancellor Olaf Scholz’s centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), with the Free Democratic party (FDP) and the Greens.Opinion polls suggest that the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader, Friedrich Merz, is likely to become the next chancellor, in a possible grand coalition with the SPD, after ruling out a formal agreement with the far-rightAlternative für Deutschland(AfD).With Germany in effective recession after the economyshrank for two consecutive years, in 2023 and 2024 – and for only the third time since the 1950s – rebooting growth and raising living standards is a top issue on the ballot. Each of the major parties has promised to revive the economy, with policies either to slash taxes or drastically increase spending to pump-prime growth. However, these costly options are likely to require the debt brake to be relaxed.The proposals follow an “almost stereotypical” split between centre-left and centre-right economic policies, says Brzeski. The SPD and Greens propose investment subsidies and tax rises for the rich, alongside reforms to the debt brake, while the CDU wants tax cuts for corporate households, public expenditure cuts, and “hoping for the magic Laffer curve to bring in more tax revenues via higher growth”.The CDU had promised in its manifesto to stick to the debt brake, orschuldenbremse. But Merz has indicated a willingness to reform the policy amid growing acknowledgment of Germany’s growth headache. Critically, Merkel, the most recent CDU chancellor, whose successive governments demanded deep austerity from other eurozone countries during the 2010s’ sovereign debt crisis, hascalled for it to be dropped.View image in fullscreenAngela Merkel, who introduced the debt brake in 2009, has recently called for it to be dropped.Photograph: Maja Hitij/Getty ImagesCritics of the debt brake say baking in austerity in tax and spending decisions contributed to the rise of the far right as low-income households were hit hard. It also rattled Scholz’s coalition, amid fierce battles over multibillion-euro holes in the federal budget, paving the way for this weekend’s elections.Engelbert Stockhammer, a professor of international political economy at King’s College London, said lifting the debt brake would be key to Germany’s revival. “It [the brake] condemns the state to inactivity in times of crisis, whether the crisis be economic, the climate crisis or about security.”He said while the economic debate ahead of the election centred on whether to lift the brake to fund business tax breaks versus a more statist agenda of public investment to improve roads, the rail network and the digital infrastructure, the need for a bigger military budget will provide the new government with political cover.“It’s the geopolitical situation that is going to achieve it. The armed forces need an offensive capability and arguing for that is something conservative politicians will feel comfortable doing.”With EU nations under pressure to increase defence spending asDonald Trump obliterates the decades-old world order, Germany in particular will need to change its approach. The country has historically spent less than the 2% of GDP target Nato countries must spend on defence. While it said itmet the goal in 2024, it falls short of Trump’s calls for spending as much as 5%.Analysts say a new government could get around this by utilising special purpose vehicles earmarked for long-term investment, which would be excluded from the accounts for the debt rule. Defence spending could also be exempted. EU nations are also exploring the option of joint defence bonds, or an escape clause from the blocs’ “Stability and Growth Pact,” which Germany currently meets, which limits government deficits to 3% of GDP and debt under 60%However, the brake may need relaxing further to deal with a cocktail of economic problems facing the German economy – including extreme pressure on the country’s traditionally dominant industrial base, faltering domestic demand and mounting competition from Chinese manufacturers.Trump’s threat of hitting the EU with tariffswould add further to the squeeze.Albrecht Ritschl, a professor of economic history at the London School ofEconomics, said: “The lack of machine tool sales acts like a flat tyre on the economy. And this combines with a confluence of factors that have all come together at the same time – a fall in trade with the UK due to Brexit, no more sales to Russia, the cost of energy and a dramatic decline in the fertility rate.”Reforming the debt brake requires a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag, as it forms part of the German constitution, meaning the ability to make changes will depend on the outcome of the election. In a splintered political landscape, reforms may also take time to negotiate.“The chances are extremely high it will be relaxed, whatever outcome,” said Brzeski. “It is obvious there are large investment needs in the economy. They won’t manage without touching the debt brake.”Explore more on these topicsEconomicsGermanyEuropeAngela MerkelanalysisShareReuse this content"

The overall fall the previous year was just eight.While Siba’s UK brewery tracker is only in its third year, the data it uses is comparable to figures from the real ale group Camra, because they both count only companies that are actually producing beer.How will alcohol duty changes affect the price of drinks?Read moreAlthough the rate of closures slowed during the year, the drop recorded in 2024 is larger than any single-year decline recorded by either Siba or Camra.Other than in the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of small breweries had grown significantly since 2002, when Gordon Brown, as chancellor,introduced tax breaks for small brewers, leading to a “craft beer revolution”.But recently, the sector has been buffeted by a maelstrom of adverse factors, including aggressive competition tactics from big brewers, rising costs and consumers tightening their belts.Margins in the sector have been erodedby wage and ingredient inflation in recent years, while many smaller players are still paying off loans taken to tide them through the Covid-19 pandemic.The cost of living crisis has also made it harder for drinkers to afford craft beers, which are often more expensive because their hops and malts are often higher quality or imported.A recent rise in alcohol duty, approved by Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government, increases duties on higher-strength brews, which are often favoured by fans of independent producers.Large brewing companies have also responded to the rise of smaller competitors by buying them out and then labelling them as “craft”.These can then be marketed through pub groups that are often owned by the brewers themselves, squeezing smaller competitors off the bar.Andy Slee, the chief executive of Siba, said demand for indie beer was still high but that small brewers were finding it hard to sell to local pubs.“Given the demand for independent beer isn’t being met locally, you have to wonder whether more local beer in community pubs would help pub closure rates as well,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Usually, comparing the two is a game of numbers: revenue, viewers, salaries, that kind of thing. But over the past 10 days, passion has emerged as a differentiator. “You can step on to an NBA floor and go through the motions,” Subban said on ESPN. “You can’t do that in hockey – you can’t. Like, the culture of our sport, you have to play it with passion. You have to be willing to fight. You have to be willing to leave it on the ice. That’s what fans are investing in.”That investment has paid off most recently with the 4 Nations Face-off tournament, which wrapped up on Thursday night in Boston.The thrilling finalbetween Canada and the US was a rematch of last Saturday’s marquee round-robin clash, a contest marked bythree fights in the opening nine seconds. The rest of the game was pretty good, too, ending with a US win. On Thursday, the tables turned. It was Canada that scored first – again – and last. Canadawon the game narrowly 3-2, after the US left Connor McDavid, the best player on the planet, open in the slot in sudden-death overtime. He made no mistake.View image in fullscreenSidney Crosby of Team Canada celebrates with his teammates after Thursday’s win in Boston.Photograph: Bruce Bennett/Getty ImagesOne of the reasons Subban was on ESPN in the first place was because of that first Canada-US game. Its intensity seemed to surprise Americans unfamiliar with the longstanding rivalry, or hockey more generally. Indeed, Subban’s mention of the NBA was no accident. It was the other reason he was on the show. Basketball fans couldn’t help but notice the difference between how little interest NBA players had shown in that league’s All-Star game over the weekend compared to the ferocity with which NHLers were competing in their mid-season showcase. But then again, the NBA also didn’t have Donald Trump in the mix. Trump’s timely geopolitical intervention – the cross-border forays ofpotential tariffs and counter-tariffsand his increasingly blunt threats against the border’s existence – was a much more unpredictable and meaningful surprise than any gimmick even the smartest NBA marketing whiz could have dreamed up for its All-Star weekend.Earlier this week, USA Hockey general manager (and former NHLer) Bill Guerintold Fox Newsthat the team “would love it if President Trump was in attendance” at the final. Trump declined, but on Thursday morning ina post on Truth Social, he said he planned to call the US hockey team “to spur them towards victory tonight against Canada, which with FAR LOWER TAXES AND MUCH STRONGER security will someday, maybe soon, become our cherished, and very important, Fifty First State”.It’s roughly here that the fun stops. As much as the tense atmosphere rewarded hockey fans with a more intense game, you get the sense that this all worked out pretty well for Trump, too. Another opportunity to broadcast his deranged plans and make something about him. We didn’t need him. Canada-US games have always been exciting – the1996 World Cupbetween the two, vicious; the2002 Olympic gold medal game, cathartic;2010, a heart-stopper. Trump’s impact, as is always the case, was to bring renewed focus on a dividing line, not to bridge it but to deepen it.View image in fullscreenAn Edmonton Oilers fan in Edmonton, Alberta, watches Canada face the United States in the final of the 4 Nations Face-Off on Thursday night.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesBut you can see why it worked. The foundation of this hockey rivalry has always been rooted in something greater, something felt but that remains unseen. Just like most other sports rivalries, only a fraction of its foundation lies directly beneath the game itself, with the rest buried deeper in history – or, in this case, in the snow. Canada v USA is really about an inherently unbalanced relationship that for two centuries or so has seen the smaller of the two partners defending itself. Through it all, hockey has been one of Canada’s few enduring emblems of supremacy – evidence it can present to the world at regular intervals to prove that it has not yet been totally subsumed, culturally or politically, by its neighbor (or neighbour). “I think we’re out there playing for the flag, not the cameras,” Team Canada forward Brandon Hagelsaid this week. “That’s a part of Canada that we have in there.”Yet, at the same time, hockey is one of Canada’s most effective tools of soft power. It would be overstating it to say that the x-factor Subban was talking about – that thing that most agree after watching the 4 Nations Face-off seems to be missing from other North American sports cultures – is Canadians (after all, there are Canadian teams in the NBA, MLB and MLS). But it would not be wrong to suggest that what all those other leagues might lack is Canadian-ness. The tenacity and drive to compete against all odds – to literally fight when called to. This thing that hockey has and others don’t could only have come from up here, somewhere along this northern territory. Trump can try to co-opt hockey into his skewed vision of America, but the reality is that no matter where you’re from, when you step on to the ice, something about you will always be Canadian.Explore more on these topicsIce hockeyCanadaWinter Olympics 2026US sportsDonald TrumpJustin TrudeaufeaturesShareReuse this content"

Leicester fans started streaming out afterBrentfordmade it 3-0 just after the half-hour mark and those who did stay to brave a torrential second-half downpour were left with the depressing claim to fame that they were there to witness an English top-flight team lose a sixth consecutive home league game without scoring for the first time in history.Leicester have lost 10 of their last 11 Premier League games – thank goodnessthey faced Tottenhamin the midst of this run – and faith that they can retain their status is starting to run out. Even Ruud van Nistelrooy appeared to be admitting his players are not good enough to stay up.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“Of course we are disappointed,” the Leicester manager said. “Every individual will reflect and recover from this. It’s blow after blow after blow. There’s a lot of hard work put in, without results, with some performances that you can take some hope from.“But we have to accept that we are in a position now where every week we face a better team. We have to prepare every week in a way to be the best we can be. We cannot ask more from ourselves. You have to look at performing at the maximum of your capabilities. And with the squad we have, it’s a huge mountain to climb to stay in this league.“You can only do the best you can. And then we’ll see at the end if it’s enough or not. But so far we’re in that bottom three for a while and every game we face a better side than ourselves.”Having signed only one player in last month’s transfer window – and Woyo Coulibaly was withdrawn at half-time of his full league debut here – they look set to mark the ninth anniversary of winning thePremier Leaguewith relegation.By the time Fábio Carvalho stabbed home Brentford’s fourth goal in the 89th minute, the remaining Leicester fans were at least united, as they chanted “sack the board”. Jon Rudkin, the director of football, is the chief target for their angst but the team are defensively soft and, with Jamie Vardy’s goals drying up since his 38th birthday last month, it is difficult to find solace. By the time they visit West Ham on Thursday, they could be eight points adrift.Brentford were excellent, extending their record sequence of consecutive away wins in the Premier League to four. Mikkel Damsgaard made two of the goals, taking his tally of assists to 10, but Thomas Frank’s team purred throughout. “It’s not always in a season you are in such sync but we’ve been playing some really good football and performing consistently,” the Brentford manager said.They are now six points off the European places. “We want to aim as high as possible but it’s about the next game,” Frank added. “I have said many times if we can keep players fit we have a really good team and players. Keep as many as possible fit and we will find a way.”View image in fullscreenLeicester’s Mads Hermansen reacts after Brentford’s Fábio Carvalho scores their fourth goal.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersGoals from Yoane Wissa, Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Nørgaard arrived after Leicester had enjoyed some excellent early incisions, with Vardy cutting his way through before Mark Flekken saved superbly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Mbuemo made it 2-0 with ease as, receiving Damsgaard’s pass wide on the right, he showed Victor Kristiansen exactly where he wanted to go, still cut inside on to his favoured left foot and curled home into the gaping net.Then Nørgaard headed home unopposed at the near post from Mbeumo’s free-kick. There was still time before the interval for Kristoffer Ajer to head against a post and Keane Lewis-Potter to have a goal ruled out for handball after Wout Faes nearly put Wissa’s cross past his own goalkeeper.Van Nistelrooy made two substitutions at half-time, with one crowd favourite, Stephy Mavididi, entering the fray; Jannik Vestergaard also came on. But the home fans’ biggest cheer of the night was reserved for the introduction of Facundo Buonanotte 10 minutes later when he replaced Jordan Ayew being the player he replaced.The Leicester faithful’s verdict on Van Nistelrooy may still be in the balance but his refusal to give Buonanotte a regular start does little for his popularity. For Leicester, however, it is starting to look like thank you and good night already.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeicester CityBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He called the ban “outdated” and “somewhat unreasonable”.“This generation, the vast majority of 20, 30s-into-the-40s men in this country have beards,” Steinbrenner said during a news conference, flanked by general manager Brian Cashman. “It is a part of who these younger men are. It’s part of their character. It’s part of their persona. Do I totally relate to that? It’s difficult for me. I’m an older guy who’s never had a beard in his life but it’s a very important thing to them. They feel it defines their character.”George Steinbrenner announced the facial policy during spring training in 1976, mandating no long hair or beards – mustaches were allowed. Players complied but some pushed boundaries by going unshaven or letting hair fall over their collars.“My dad was in the military. He believed that a team should look in a disciplined manner,” Hal Steinbrenner said. “Very important to my father, but again [for] my father, nothing is more important than winning and that’s in the back of my mind.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided by Instagram.

Steinbrenner then issued a statement Friday morning that “we will be amending our expectations to allow our players and uniformed personnel to have well-groomed beards moving forward”.Cashman said CC Sabathia hesitated because of the hair policy before signing with the Yankees ahead of the 2009 season and the agent of a player contemplating a minor league contract this offseason wasn’t sure his client would be willing to shave.Cashman said some current players had told him of the facial hair ban: “It’s not what I want. It’s not my preference, but I will honor the rules of the land.”As recently as Monday, the Yankees had left reminders on the clubhouse chair of each player to arrive clean shaven the following morning for photo day.All-Star closer Devin Williams, acquired in an offseason trade from Milwaukee, had hair on his chin for his photo. Williams, eligible for free agency after this season, had a beard when he played for the Brewers.“The New York Yankees are different,” Cashman said. “This is obviously a special place in baseball history. That logo has a lot of meaning behind it and we want our past and our present players to recognize that, and the future players to recognize that. So ultimately there’s still going to be things that we’re going to hold onto that are important for us, but I think as just Hal said more importantly is always trying to be a championship-caliber franchise and chasing winning.”Outfielder Alex Verdugo was forced to trim his previously long hair when he was traded to the Yankees ahead of the 2024 season. Clay Holmes and Gleyber Torres arrived at spring training this year with beards after leaving the Yankees.“It’s somewhat surprising just because of how long the rule’s been around,” Holmes said.George Steinbrenner, who bought the Yankees in 1973, died in 2010.“I have nothing against long hair per se,” George Steinbrenner said in 1976, according to The New York Times. “But I’m trying to instill certain sense of order and discipline in the ballclub because I think discipline is important in an athlete.”The Cincinnati Reds banned facial hair in 1902 and under general manager Bon Howsam started strict enforcement in 1967. The ban was lifted by owner Marge Schott in February 1999 at the behest of outfielder Greg Vaughn, who had just been acquired from San Diego.Explore more on these topicsNew York YankeesMLBBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But stopping home invasions can be difficultTom DartFri 21 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 05.03 ESTShareAs Joe Burrow led the Cincinnati Bengals to a 27-20 victory over the Dallas Cowboys last December a group allegedly robbed the quarterback’s home during a cross-country crime spree that targeted at least six high-profile athletes.The thefts highlight the unique vulnerabilities faced by famous athletes whose salaries and work schedules are accessible on the internet in seconds, as well as the mix of careful planning and brazen tactics used by criminals to elude security measures.Burrow’s security detail was posted in his front driveway while he was in Texas but the burglars entered from the rear of the property, making off with about $300,000 in designer luggage, glasses, watches and jewellery, according to a court document.In acriminal complaintunsealed on Tuesday, federal prosecutors in Florida allege that a group of seven Chilean men stole items worth millions of dollars from the homes of at least four NFL and two NBA players during break-ins last year.In October the houses of the Kansas City Chiefs’ biggest stars, Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes,were robbed of valuablesincluding watches, cash and jewelry. Mahomes was burgled two days before the Chiefs hosted the New Orleans Saints on 7 October, while $20,000 in cash was stolen from Kelce’s home on the day of the game.Later that month an unnamed Tampa Bay Buccaneers player had $167,000 worth of goods taken while the Buccaneers played the Baltimore Ravens, according to the FBI, including a Louis Vuitton suitcase, Rolex watches and a gun. The alleged thieves have also been linked to items valued at $1m stolen from two-time NBA All-StarJa Morantduring a game and $1.5m worth of goods taken from the home of a Milwaukee Bucks player,Bobby Portis Jr, around tip-off time as the Bucks faced the Cleveland Cavaliers on 2 November.Last November the NFLissued an alertto warn team security directors and the players’ union about the threat. The league saidin an articlethat the perpetrators conducted “extensive surveillance”, tracked team schedules and the social media accounts of players and their families, broke in to empty properties and focused on items in master bedrooms and closets. It urged players to install security systems, hide valuables and avoid posting in real time on social media.TheNBAand FBI alsodisseminated warnings. “Organized theft groups bypass alarm systems, use wifi jammers to block wifi connections and disable devices, cover security cameras, and obfuscate their identities,” the agency cautioned. “These homes are targeted for burglary due to the perception they may have high-end goods like designer handbags, jewellery, watches, and cash.”The FBI complaint alleges that the modus operandi of the Chilean group was to approach residences from cover such as wooded or dark areas and force entry through a window or door. It claims that to cover their tracks they switched mobile phones or sim cards every month or so and used fake identification to rent a car.But this seemingly painstaking preparation may have been undermined by hubristic celebrations: aphotographobtained by prosecutors appears to show some of the suspects gleefully posing with Portis’ stolen safe and watches. In the complaint an FBI agent writes that they believe the men “were bragging to co-conspirators about their recent burglary” of Portis. “It’s crazy that the picture is on there. Like – I’m not going to say anything about that. It works me up, man,” Portistold reporters.Other crimes not linked to the group in the indictment have occurred recently. The Los Angeles home of the LAFC striker Olivier Giroud wasreportedly targetedearlier this month by burglars who entered through a smashed window while the player and his family were out and took valuables worth $500,000. Three Stanley Cup rings weresaid to have been stolenfrom Evgeni Malkin’s house in suburban Pittsburgh last month as the P Penguins hosted the Ottawa Senators. The home of the NBA superstar Luka Dončić, then with the Dallas Mavericks, wasburgled in December.In a tragic incident, Sean Taylor, a star for Washington’s NFL team, was fatally shot at his Florida home in 2007 in a confrontation during a botched robbery.Five men were charged in the incident; one told police that they thought the 24-year-old would be away with the team, who were playing against Tampa Bay. But Taylor was sidelined with a knee injury.Thefts are also a serious problem for footballers in Europe. Raheem Stirlingleft the England squadduring the 2022 World Cup in Qatar after a break-in at his home in Surrey, while Angel Di María wassubstituted during a Paris Saint-Germain matchin 2021 after it emerged that his home had been robbed while his family were present. The forward Karim Benzema wasrepeatedly burgledwhile playing for Real Madrid. Medals were stolen from the home of Chelsea’s Reece James while he was playing in a Champions League game in 2021 by robbers,he said, who “managed to collectively lift a heavy safe containing some personal items of mine into their car”.The Manchester City players Jack Grealish andKevin De Bruynewere also targeted. “The people that commit these terrible crimes have no idea of the damage they cause to peoples’ lives,”Grealish wroteon social media, adding he was “devastated” by the “traumatic experience” his family endured in December 2023, during which £1m-worth of jewellery and watches werereportedly stolenwhile they were watching City play Everton, prompting his partner to press a panic button. In 2021, when on City’s books, the Portuguese defender João Cancelo suffered facial injuriesduring a home invasion. The former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Dele Alli waspunched and robbed at knifepointat his north London home in 2020.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But unfortunately it’s happened, it’s happened many times,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters. “Today you have to be careful, definitely. Not much on social media, the less they know what you are doing the better. People are waiting. Waiting to see where you are.”It is typically easy to discover the addresses of celebrities in the US, with property ownership generally a matter of public record. And unlike, say, business executives who may have comparable fortunes but enjoy relative anonymity, players are household names. While teams and leagues look after security in stadiums and training centres, players and agents should pay close attention to private arrangements, says Jim Hayes, a sports security expert who is VP, Sports Entertainment and Government Affairs for Guidepost Solutions, an investigations and consultancy firm.“Many of the directors of security for teams that I’m in touch with are working with players, working with player agents, not necessarily as a function of a team responsibility but a moral responsibility to want to make sure that the players are well-protected, well-informed, they have the information they need and they’re taking the steps to protect themselves,” he says.It is not only a matter of personal safety: “If that player is more concerned about having a house that’s unsafe or property that’s not defended, there’s a good chance that can affect their overall performance.”Burrowtold reportersthat the theft and subsequent attention took a mental toll. “I feel like my privacy has been violated in more ways than one, and way more is out there than I would want out there and that I care to share,” he said. “We live a public life and one of my least favourite parts of that is the lack of privacy, and that has been difficult to deal with my entire career. I’m still learning, but I understand it’s the life that we choose. It doesn’t make it any easier to deal with.”Strategies to counteract the kind of tactics allegedly used in the recent US burglaries could include installing firmly embedded safes and advanced security perimeters. “Cameras, motion detection, there’s AI technology now that can differentiate between what is an expected movement around the property or in any area and what is a movement that would be associated with some type of unlawful behaviour,” Hayes says.“There are ways to design a complete security plan for all properties, for all assets, even extending to the digital footprint an athlete leaves … Sometimes that means maybe not posting on social media six times a day. That’s really difficult in this state that we’re in, because part of the athlete’s popularity – and certainly when you talk about colleges with [profit potential from] the name, image and likeness – part of their ability to get paid is their popularity and so they want to be interacting with the fanbase,” he adds. “Athletes are learning the hard way that those are things they have to consider.”Explore more on these topicsSportPatrick MahomesNFLNBAOlivier GiroudBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What is the relationship betweenMLSand the top football leagues of Europe? Is it a retirement league for aging superstars, a development league for those on their way to bigger things, or a home for the lateral career move, a kind of footballing purgatory? Where should it sit in the American sporting calendar, and what should be the competition’s relationship to the surrounding culture: is MLS an American sporting league whose sport happens to be soccer, or a soccer league that happens to take place in America?There are questions of direction as well. What is the correct tempo for the competition’s growth, and what kind of league should expansion aim to create? Is this a league that wants to compete with the best of the best, or simply seeks to serve a gap in the domestic market? Aspirationally, is MLS a “world league” in the mold of the Premier League, a league that serves as a center of gravity for playing talent throughout the western hemisphere, or something more modest?As MLS begins its thirtieth season this weekend, these questions remain as pertinent and tantalizingly open as ever. But this season also promises some measure of clarification, an interim verdict of sorts: in June and July, as the league continues to weigh a schedule change that would bring its season in line with European club football’s fall-to-spring calendar, MLS will pause for the Club World Cup taking place on American soil. This edition of Fifa’s top club competition is, of course, a certified big deal. It will function both as the launch of an expanded 32-team format meant to give a competition once seen as an afterthought some real meaning, and as the curtain raiser for next year’s North American World Cup – a critical juncture in soccer’s ongoing effort to conquer the world’s biggest media market.Why shouldn’t North America’s top soccer league have 30 teams? On the other hand: should it have 30 teams?As big as this summer will be for Fifa, it will be even bigger for MLS: the participation of Seattle Sounders and Inter Miami in the Club World Cup – the former qualifying via their historic 2022 Concacaf Champions Cup title, the latter via an elaborate, Fifa-stamped approval process known as “getting knocked out in the opening rounds of the MLS playoffs but having Lionel Messi on your team” – will offer a benchmark for MLS’s progress against some of the world’s best clubs. Inter Miami have been handed a relatively friendly group with Palmeiras, Porto, and Al Ahly, while Seattle face a sterner test, with PSG, Atlético Madrid, and Botafogo standing in the way of their progression to the knockout rounds. Since his arrival in Miami one and a half seasons ago, Messi’s MLS appearances have inspired as much admiration for hison-field sorceryas they have derision for the quality of the defending he’s faced; whether fairly or not, popular perceptions of MLS are that of a footballing backwater. The Club World Cup is the league’s big chance to silence the doubters. Do the US’s best clubs – however creatively defined – truly belong on the world stage? Is MLS, as it’s sometimes claimed, the strongest and most competitive league outside Europe’s Big Five? We are about to find out.For Inter Miami and Lionel Messi, a club-defining season awaitsRead moreMLS commissioner Don Garber, perhaps wary of how damaging a poor showing from the league’s two representatives could be to MLS’s reputation, is doing his best to keep expectations in check.“Clearly, MLS teams are at the lower quadrant of transfer market value,” GarbertoldThe Athletic after the Club World Cup draw last month. “And that’s something, over time, that I hope will continue to grow as our teams are investing more in players and hopefully generating more revenue to justify that expense.”Garber is right, of course. Even in European soccer’s new age of financial controls and profitability rulings, salary cap-constrained MLS teams simply can’t compete with the big clubs across the Atlantic. But his response was also uncharacteristically downbeat. Just a few weeks earlier, hetolda sports investment conference that the top European leagues would be in “much, much better shape” if they were more like MLS. That was a much more representative expression of his customary braggadocio, and it also captures some of the tensions and growing pains besetting the league on the eve of its thirtieth season.View image in fullscreenMessi’s arrival has brought a flood of new attention on the league.Photograph: Ryan Sun/APBy most measures MLS has been a roaring success: average match attendance last season reached a record 23,234, and this year the league will welcome San Diego FC as its 30th franchise. On the field things are humming along nicely enough. Celebrity pre-retirees like Messi and Luis Suárez bring headline pizzazz, but the league has also provided fertile terrain for younger players looking for a mid-career reset (Evander, Denis Bouanga, Riqui Puig). Expansion has brought new investors and fans to the sport, while changing the very fabric of the US’s built environment: soccer-specific stadiums are now a feature of most cities with MLS franchises, giving professional soccer a tangible presence in that it once lacked in the country.Could Messi do it on an inhumanely cold night in Kansas City? Of course he couldRead moreBut in some ways the league has become a victim of this success; the mechanisms that have allowed it to expand so healthily over the past three decades now seem like obstacles to future development. Salary caps have helped keep the league even during the first decades of its growth, and aggressive expansion of the type Garber has pursued makes sense for a country with a population of 330 million and an insatiable appetite for professional sports. Why shouldn’t North America’s top soccer league have 30 teams? On the other hand:shouldit have 30 teams? And where do you draw the line?Culturally MLS remains a bit of a non-entity. This is a league that benefits from America’s size, the country’s undiminished capacity to absorb and finance myriad cultures and sporting enthusiasms, while barely making an impression on the national consciousness. Soccer, for all its local advances over the past few decades, still hovers beyond the mainstream. The Messi show might coax LeBron James and Serena Williams out to Chase Stadium on occasion, but the MLS playoffs command none of the attention and prestige of the post-seasons in baseball, football, basketball, or even hockey. MLS seems simultaneously too American for most international football fans (cue jokes about Dick’s Sporting Goods Park and Lower.com Field) and too international for the casual American sports lover; an import that’s been tolerated but never truly embraced. The 18 months ahead, with World Cups at both club and national level to look forward to, will give soccer an unprecedented burst of exposure on these shores. These should be MLS’s golden days. So why don’t they feel like it?View image in fullscreenMLS teams can be popular in local markets, but most have yet to break through nationally.Photograph: Troy Wayrynen/USA Today SportsMLS is now at the point where the structures put in place to ensure equitable development of soccer in the US are starting to eat into each other: a salary cap and league expansion may make sense on their own, but a salary cap combined with an ongoing imperative of growth potentially limit the quality of play on the field, which is the most vital commodity of any professional sports competition. Meanwhile the fees to join the league have become so prohibitive – San Diego’s owners paid MLS $500m to become the league’s 30th team – that new franchises risk taking shape in a way that leaves them unconnected to the local communities they’re designed to serve, further undermining one of the rationales for salary caps and other aspects of the league’s institutional design.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would also inject professional soccer in this country with something that other US pro sports leagues lack: a real and dynamic sense of stakes, of permanent divisional jeopardy. Relegation and promotion battles would help MLS further stand out in a crowded domestic sporting landscape, giving soccer a point of differentiation over other sports reliant on the same post-season pop to generate mainstream interest.But MLS’s design as a single legal entity that owns all the teams – a major point of contrast with the leagues of Europe, where clubs operate as separate legal bodies then own a stake in whichever league they operate in – prevents any kind of opening along these lines. And other aspects of the league’s operational strategy militate against it: potential new team owners, for instance, will probably not want to invest millions into a team if there is a danger of relegation lurking on the horizon. With major structural reform unlikely, MLS could easily expand to 40 teams and beyond (though probably not in short order – Garber said last year that San Diego would be “the end of expansion for a period of time until we’re ready to expand again.”)Ordinarily one might expect the United States’ cult of competition to encourage rival leagues to emerge in the shadow of this bloat, but challenges to MLS’s domestic supremacy pose little threat, for now at least. A jury recentlydismissedan anti-trust action brought by the now defunct North American Soccer League over MLS’s alleged strangling of lower league soccer; meanwhile United Soccer League, a would-be rival to MLS, hasannouncedplans to launch a division one men’s professional league in 2027. But that plan is only in its embryonic stage.Could a new rule finally give MLS much-needed transfer gossip?Read moreMLS has the power of incumbency, with all its financial, physical and cultural assets: media and sponsorship deals, stadiums, fanbases. Moves from upstart leagues like USL seem unlikely to prompt much soul searching among Garber and his associates. Displays of short-term progress remain the league’s priority over the more disruptive decisions needed to reform US professional soccer and put the domestic game on a sustainable long-term footing.Emblematic of this curiously dynamic stasis is MLS’s 2023 decision to ink a ten-year, $2.5bn broadcast deal with Apple. Superficially this deal presents a real marker of progress. In 1999, the year Garber took over as commissioner the status of soccer in this country was so dire that the league eventually formed its own marketing company to produce and distribute the 2002 and 2006 World Cups. But in another sense the Apple deal, which makes all matches available on Apple TV via the $15 per month MLS Season Pass, limits the sport’s potential audience. The league’s reach on cable TV now barely extends beyond the one game a week shown on Fox Sports. Apple TV’s live broadcasts may be high quality but the success of the streaming deal remains hard to gauge, since Apple and MLS refuse to disclose subscriber numbers.The arrangement boxes in the league in other ways. Apple TV isreleasingan “eight-part panoramic documentary event” based on the 2024 MLS season this week – but is there a point in evangelizing to existing subscribers? Drive to Survive did a lot to build Formula One’s popularity in the US but it didn’t do it from behind the same paywall; it was out there on Netflix withall the other slop.The Apple deal was designed, at least in part, as a sweetener to entice Messi to play out his career in America: Inter Miami’s star attraction receives a cut of the MLS Season Pass subscription windfall as part of his pay package. In no other top professional football league would the administration have the centralized power to decree a deal of this nature; but in no other top league would it be deemed necessary to bet so heavily on a single player.This is the bind in which MLS finds itself as it enters its thirties: its greatest institutional strengths are also its biggest weaknesses. Efficiency has given way to rigidity, short-term gimmicks take precedence over long-term repairs, and expansion is transforming into stagnation. Garber’s boundless rhetorical confidence in the destiny of the sport in this country seemingly belies some unresolved insecurity. Soccer wants America. But does America want soccer?Explore more on these topicsMLSBusiness of soccerUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Villa may be grateful for that: had they taken a point from that game they would have been facing Bayern in the last 16. That said, as domestic form has stagnated,the victory over Bayern, a repeat of the scoreline from the 1982 European Cup final, probably represents the high point of their season so far. Domestically this hasn’t been a great campaign for Brugge either. They lie eight points behind Racing Genk but for them too the Champions League has provided salvation. They sneaked into the playoffs with three wins but then were much the better side against Atalanta, winning home and away.Verdict:NarrowAston VillawinLiverpool face PSG as Champions League last-16 draw sets up Madrid derbyRead moreBorussia Dortmund v LilleLille were perhaps the biggest surprise of the league stage, beating Atlético and Real Madrid and hammering Feyenoord as they finished seventh. Canada’s Jonathan David, who scored six times, isclearly a dangerous front manbut a lack of creativity may hold them back; there is a reason why they are fifth in Ligue 1, having scored eight goals fewer than any side above them. This has been a difficult season for Dortmund, who are 11th in the Bundesliga. Nuri Sahin was sacked after four straight defeats following the winter break and, while three wins in seven under Niko Kovac isn’t a startling uptick, the Guinea centre-forward Serhou Guirassy has hit form and that run did include an impressive 3-0 win at Sporting in the playoffs – albeit the Lisbon side are not what they were before the departure of Ruben Amorim.Verdict:NarrowLillewinView image in fullscreenBorussia Dortmund’s Serhou Guirassy has found his scoring touch of late.Photograph: Armando França/APReal Madrid v Atlético MadridReal Madrid lie one point and one position above Atlético in La Liga, and both league meetings this season finished 1-1, so it should be tight – although on all five previous occasions they have met in European competition, Real Madrid have come out on top. Atlético were the form team in Europe until last month’s defeat at Leganés, having won 15 in a row, a run that enabled them to surge back after two early defeats to qualify fifth in the league phase. Even though results have dipped slightly over the past month, they have lost only one of their past 23, as Diego Simeone continues to defy convention. As Kylian Mbappé demonstrated with hishat-trick against Manchester Cityon Wednesday, he is finally beginning to settle at Madrid, but this remains a battle between a team based on discipline and organisation and one reliant on the inspiration of brilliant individuals.Verdict:NarrowReal MadridwinBayern Munich v Bayer LeverkusenThe sidesdrew 1-1 in Munichin September before agoalless draw at the BayArenalast week, a game in which Leverkusen looked much the better side and hit the woodwork twice. Bayern are eight points clear at the top of the Bundesliga but doubts remain about Vincent Kompany, largely because of performances in Europe. They lost to Villa, Barcelona and Feyenoord in the group stage, and squeaked through their playoff against Celtic only with an injury-time winner after a performance in which they looked worryingly slow and mannered. Following last season’s undefeated Bundesliga success was always going to be difficult for Xabi Alonso’s Leverkusen side, but while they have probably drawn too many games, they have lost only once in the league. Group-stage results were a mixed bag: Leverkusen were the only side to beat Inter, but they lost at Atlético and were well beaten at Liverpool. Florian Wirtz’s recent form could be decisive.Verdict:Narrow Leverkusen winPSV v ArsenalDefensively,Arsenalare the best team in the Premier League, and only Inter conceded fewer in the league stage, but they had goalscoring problems even before their front three went down with hamstring injuries. Inter were the only team to beat them in the league stage and they have lost only twice in the Premier League. Given Mikel Arteta’s emphasis on control, two-leg ties may suit them, but set plays and Mikel Merino may not be sufficient sources of goals. Peter Bosz’s side lost to Juventus in the league phase, then lost to them again in the first leg of their playoff, but victory in the second leg took them through after extra time. Second in the Eredivisie, PSV are a typical Bosz side, full of goals and leaky at the back. When the sides met in last season’s group, they drew in Eindhoven but Arsenal were 4-0 winners at the Emirates.Verdict:Comfortable Arsenal winskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most impressive was their defensive record: one goal conceded in those eight games, although they have been less stingy in Serie A. Lautaro Martínez, meanwhile, continues to be a forward who divides opinion, somehow simultaneously prolific and profligate.Feyenoord, fourth in the Eredivisie, sacked Brian Priske last week and are yet to appoint a full-time replacement, though Robin van Persie has been lined up. Their group stage was erratic: they came from 3-0 down to draw at Manchester City, won at Benfica, beat Bayern 3-0 and yet also went down 6-1 at Lille. Most confusingly, their playoff win over Milan, under the interim Pascal Bosschaart, was based on containment. Much will depend on the battle of the Inter wing-backs Denzel Dumfries and Federico Di Marco with Feyenoord’s wide forwards Anis Moussa and Igor Paixão.Verdict:Comfortable Inter winQuick GuideChampions League: last 16 drawShowPSV Eindhoven v ArsenalReal Madrid v AtléticoParis Saint-Germain v LiverpoolClub Brugge v Aston VillaBenfica v BarcelonaBorussia Dortmund v LilleBayern Munich v LeverkusenFeyenoord v InterBracket is in order after home/away fixtures were drawn; so winner of PSV v Arsenal will be at home first in quarter-final against Real or Atlético, and so on.Ties take place on 4/5 & 11/12 March.Quarter finals take place on 8/9 & 15/16 April.Semi finals take place on 29/30 April & 6/7 May.Final: 31 May (Allianz Arena, Munich).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Paris Saint-Germain v LiverpoolTop of the Premier League, Liverpool also topped the Champions League group, but they are not playing as well as they were when they outplayed Real Madrid in November. They have failed to win seven of their past 14 games and, while it’s true that none of their three defeats in that spell were particularly consequential, it’s also true that league form has become scratchier, most notably in the second half of Sunday’sweirdly anxious win over Wolves. Obliterating French sides has rarely been a problem for Paris Saint-Germain, so it was no great surprise when they thrashed Brest 10-0 on aggregate in the playoffs. And while it was a struggle to get there, after one victory from their first five group games, PSG have won their past five Champions League matches, a run that includes the 4-2 demolition of Manchester City. This new celebrity-free PSG may be finding their feet.Verdict:Narrow PSG winBarcelona v BenficaTheir meeting last month produced arguably the match of the league stage asBarcelonawon 5-4, a game that highlighted the attacking strengths and defensive weaknesses of both sides. No team scored more in the league phase, but no side in the top half conceded more than Barcelona, who would have finished top had they beaten rather than drawn with Atalanta on the final day. A run of four wins after four without a win has taken them back to the top of La Liga. Benfica have a similar energy: under Bruno Lage they’re a much breezier side than his Wolves ever were, with goals throughout the side. Even the second leg of their playoff against Monaco, as they protected a 1-0 lead, ended up as a 3-3 nerve-shredder. Ángel Di María, whose capacity to orchestrate breaks remains supreme despite his loss of pace, should be back from hamstring problems to play.Verdict:Narrow Barcelona winExplore more on these topicsChampions LeagueClub BruggeAston VillaBorussia DortmundLilleReal MadridAtlético MadridanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Frenchman has made four substitute appearances, his latest coming off the benchagainst Arsenalafter James Justin was forced off in the first half, facing up to Raheem Sterling on the right-hand side of Leicester’s defence. If Justin does not recover in time for Brentford’s visit, it seems likely that Coulibaly will once again be thrust into action because Ruud van Nistelrooy has very limited options. Considering the form of Brentford’s Kevin Schade, the French defender can expect to have a difficult afternoon. Still, it is also an opportunity to prove he is worthy of being a Premier League player but if it does not work out, there will be even greater pressure on the much-criticised director of football, Jon Rudkin.Will UnwinLeicester vBrentford, Friday 8pm (all times GMT)2Moyes waves to old club from aboveRuben Amorim has taken 14 points from 14 Premier League games as Manchester United manager, guiding the club from 13th to 15th in the table. David Moyes has won 13 points from six league matches in charge of Everton,lifting a relegation-threatened teamfrom 16th to 14th in the process. At this rate Sir Jim Ratcliffe may want the Scot back at Old Trafford. Moyes is now looking down on two clubs that dispensed with his services, with Everton’s revival also taking them above West Ham, and Saturday presents an opportunity to take another big step towards safety. A depleted squad will not wash as an excuse for Amorim on this occasion – Everton also have an injury crisis that necessitates putting untested academy players on the bench – and he needs a reaction to thedefeat at Tottenhamregardless. Doubts are growing although, as the latest struggling United manager stands alongside one of his predecessors at Goodison Park, Amorim and Moyes might share a common belief that perhapsUnited’s biggest problemis not the man in their position.Andy HunterEverton vManchester United, Saturday 12.30pmView image in fullscreenDavid Moyes and resurgent Everton are up against his former club Manchester United.Photograph: Andrew Kearns/CameraSport/Getty Images3Wolves should take a risk with MunetsiVítor Pereira and Wolves were left disappointed toleave Anfield last weekendwith nothing except some words of praise from opponents and pundits alike. They ensured Liverpool failed to have a single shot in the second half, no mean feat against a team that are favourites to win the Premier League title. Wolves were competent in the first half but were vastly improved after the break when Marshall Munetsi and Jean-Ricner Bellegarde came on. It leaves Pereira with something to ponder, as he will have a difficult decision on whether to start the two players that made a difference or hold them back. One thing counting against Munetsi is that he is a defensive midfielder by trade, but the Zimbabwe international was thrust into a more attacking role at Anfield. It would therefore not necessarily be a straight swap for the visitors at the Vitality Stadium unless Pereira wants to take another risk, which might be what Wolves need.WUBournemouth v Wolves, Saturday 3pm4Spence v Hutchinson is a key battleThe emptying of the Tottenham treatment room has been a much-needed boost to Ange Postecoglou over the past two weeks, giving the team a renewed sense that they can still have an exciting final three months of the season. One positive of the crisis was the re-emergence of the forgotten man Djed Spence who has become a mainstay at full-back, showing his versatility by playing on the left, not his natural side. Spence had struggled since arriving from Middlesbrough after impressing at Nottingham Forest but has finally found his feet in the top flight. If he gets the nod once more at Portman Road, he would face Omari Hutchinson. The former Arsenal man created Liam Delap’s goal at Villa last week and may be the most creative player in the Tractor Boys’ ranks. It could be the duel that decides the outcome of what feels like a tight match, especially asIpswich shocked Tottenhamearlier this season in north London.WUIpswich v Tottenham, Saturday 3pm5Saints fans deserve credit this seasonRalph Hasenhüttl was the most recent permanent Southampton manager to earn two Premier League wins, and he was sacked in November 2022. Since his exit Nathan Jones, Rubén Sellés and Russell Martin all failed to reach this pathetic milestone, while Ivan Juric has asolitary victoryin his nine games in charge. It really is a dreadful record – as is one home win all season – but Saints fans are still showing up. They know that the Championship is calling, the team are not fit for purpose and a fortnightly defeat at St Mary’s is expected. More than 31,000 people still come toevery home game, living in hope that there might be a positive outcome to put a spring in their step. The supporters deserve plenty of credit for doing what they can to back their team, even if the season has been one giant shortcoming. Brighton are heavy favourites on Saturday but the home fans will still be there, out of loyalty and hope.WUSouthampton v Brighton, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenSouthampton are heading for the drop but fans are still marching in to St Mary’s.Photograph: Matt Watson/Southampton FC/Getty Images6Mikel’s new striking option: MikelCould Mikel Merino be the man to save Arsenal’s season? The Spaniard’stwo goals off the benchagainst Leicester breathed new life into their pursuit of Liverpool, and West Ham’s visit to the Emirates on Saturday gives them an opportunity to close the gap to only five points. The big question is whether Merino’s compatriot and namesake will start with the Spain midfielder in his new role as a striker, or if Mikel Arteta thinks he could again be more effective coming off the bench. Leandro Trossard was employed as the false 9 against Leicester but was much more dangerous when he replaced Raheem Sterling on the left and set up Merino’s second goal. Sterling – who has started only four Premier League games since joining on loan from Chelsea and is yet to score – has looked seriously off the pace and will probably have to make way against Graham Potter’s side.Ed AaronsArsenal v West Ham, Saturday 3pm7Another test against strugglers for SilvaFulham are creeping into the race to qualify for the Champions League. They remain outsiders but will have a chance if the Premier League earns an extra spot this season. Marco Silva’s side are four points off fifth place and should be buzzing afterbeating Nottingham Forest last weekend. A worry, though, is that Fulham have blown too many winnable games.Victories over Chelsea,Newcastleand Forest are commendable but failing to take maximum points in home games against strugglers such asIpswich,SouthamptonandManchester Unitedwill leave Silva wondering what might have been. Fulham have to be clinical when they host Crystal Palace on Saturday.Jacob SteinbergFulham vCrystal Palace, Saturday 3pm8A new defensive formula for Emery again?There were murmurs of excitement every time Marcus Rashford received the ballat Villa Park on Wednesday. Even before kick-off, the stadium announcer roared his name that little bit louder when reading the teams aloud, the intonation in his voice a giveaway of the sense of anticipation. It was Rashford’s first start in a Villa shirt but on the night Axel Disasi – another, less heralded, loanee – was perhaps their best performer. At one point Disasi even skated down the left touchline à la Rashford but it was in defence where he impressed, even if for Villa it is now one clean sheet in their past 16 matches. The pain for Unai Emery is Disasi cannot build on a promising performance against Chelsea on Saturday, with the Frenchman ineligible to play against his parent club. Ezri Konsa could return from injury or youngster Lamare Bogarde could fill in alongside Tyrone Mings. Do not rule out an 11th different centre-back pairing this season.Ben FisherAston Villa v Chelsea, Saturday 5.30pmView image in fullscreenAston Villa’s Axel Disasi (left) is ineligible against his parent club, Chelsea.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/Reuters9Former players could haunt NewcastleAs Chris Wood and Elliot Anderson prepare to return to their former home in Nottingham Forest colours, no one is quite sure which Newcastle team will emerge from tunnel. When Eddie Howe’s team are good, they are very good – just ask the beaten Carabao Cup semi-finalists Arsenal – but, aslast weekend’s 4-0 thrashingat Manchester City confirmed, when they are bad, they really are bad. Howe’s worry is that his players may be distracted by a desire to avoid injury before the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool in mid-March. His problem is a lack of competition among a squad that has not been refreshed with a first-team-ready player during the past three transfer windows. How a manager said to be contemplating replacing Martin Dubravka with Nick Pope in goal for a match that may well help determine Champions League qualification could do with having Wood and Anderson still on his books.Louise TaylorNewcastle vNottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm10City host Reds’ biggest game of the seasonThere’s a strong argument to be made thatManchester City’s 2-1 home win over Liverpoolin January 2019 was the highest quality Premier League match of the past decade. Both sides are well off that level now and, while Arne Slot’s side are nevertheless in control of the title race, tension is intensifying. Liverpool followeddefeat by Plymouthwithlast-second devastation at Everton, were thenunimpressive in edging Wolves, anda draw at Villaoffered Arsenal, their only semi-serious pursuers, further encouragement. That makes Sunday’s Etihad clash the most important game of the season so far: should Liverpool win, it will be hard to see them being caught, but should they falter, the sense that they are a decent team taking advantage of serendipitous lapses elsewhere will compound. The question, though, is whether City are able to locate their energy and rhythm after a chastening experience in Madrid; Pep Guardiola’s side might just be ideal opponents for a side low on confidence.Daniel HarrisManchester City v Liverpool, Sunday 4.30pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool2636612Arsenal2529533Nottm Forest2512474Man City2517445AFC Bournemouth2515436Chelsea2513437Newcastle259418Fulham255399Aston Villa26-33910Brighton2503711Brentford2513412Tottenham Hotspur25123013Crystal Palace25-33014Everton25-43015Man Utd25-72916West Ham25-182717Wolverhampton25-191918Ipswich25-271719Leicester25-301720Southampton25-389Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendLeicester CityBrentfordEvertonManchester UnitedBournemouthWolverhampton WanderersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the very least, can we please stop comparing him unfavourably with Andy Carroll. This should be taken as a general cease-and-desist plea from those of us with an interest in preserving the Carroll legacy. But it also feels like an important note of distinction in a week when Arne Slot has unexpectedly made Núñez into a person of interest in the Premier League title race bydwelling on his now-famous missagainst Aston Villa.There may be sound internal reasons for this. Slot is very shrewd. The season has so far been an exercise in control and smart judgment. But from the outside, telling Núñez off in public feels unnecessary at this late stage, like shoehorning jeopardy into the third act of a generic Hollywood movie, the needless car chase four-fifths of the way through Paddington 5: Paddington Harder.Champions League last 16: tie-by-tie analysis and predictionsRead morePossibly, and all conclusions will as ever be outcome-based, this will end up being a significant mistake. But it’s also interesting in its own right, and for various reasons.First the Núñez/Carroll dynamic. This comparison is purely visual. Both are tall and have slick dark ponytails in the “Croydon facelift” style. The music press used to do this a lot, grouping bands together on the basis of hairstyles. Núñez-as-Carroll is like listing both Spandau Ballet and Soft Cell as New Romantics in the early 1980s.Both had quiffy, feathery haircuts. But watching an early Spandau Ballet performance is like being jostled by angry handsome plumbers shouting Marvin Gaye songs. Whereas listening to Marc Almond is like perching on a stool in a basement bar while a skinny, unsettling man sings Jacques Brel-style torch ballads dressed only in a metal codpiece and nipple clamps. Both good. Both with good hair. But contrasting vibes.In football terms the key difference between Núñez and Carroll is spatial and range-based. Carroll at his best was a set of powerful and surprisingly precise patterns enacted in a small space. Núñez, by contrast, is about creating space with unpredictable movements over a much larger area.View image in fullscreenDarwin Núñez blasts the ball over the bar from close range against Aston Villa.Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty ImagesCarroll was a footballer of the skies, which led to him being compared to many things during his career. The carcass of an ox siege-catapulted over the castle walls. A mattress thrown from a balcony on to a crowded dancefloor. But his best moments were at close-quarters and precise, from the famous header for England against Sweden at Euro 2012, perfect spatial awareness, elite neck-muscle flex, to those overhead kicks where he seemed somehow to have turned the rest of the world upside down while he remained static, a foot suddenly where his head used to be, a miracle of explosive control in a very narrow range.Núñez operates at ground level, and more expansively. There was the goal at Brentford last season where he ran 60 yards, just eating the space, and produced a finish so absurdly out-there, a floating miracle-scoop on the move, that it seemed to really upset people, to say, yes, this is frankly unsustainable. This season heproduced a winning turnat the same ground when he came late into a tight, settled game and broke it open with his more random angles.And now we have this, Wednesday night, That Miss, and Slot’s decisions to dwell on it as a significant note after the game. Is this a sign of being rattled? Probably not. Slot is super-smart. Dutch people often just say things. There may have been a dressing room imperative to employ the nuclear option of going public. Maybe being rattled is OK anyway. Football is rattling. People who win also get rattled. We just don’t hold it against them for years on the internet.Slot was also very clear it was Núñez’s perceived lack of effort afterwards that bothered him, not the miss itself. This makes sense. A Núñez who gets discouraged when he misses is basically a 1% Núñez, the butterfly-lifespan Núñez. This person cannot exist on a football pitch.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreOn the other hand is it actually wise to do this when everyone out there is looking for cracks and signs of stress, a plateauing that could, in the broadcasters’ most fevered dreams, turn into a choke-based entertainment vehicle? If Slot really doesn’t want that moment to “get in his head”, how is hearing his manager talk about it going to help with this?The real objection is that to raise it in public seems to miss what Núñez’s role is going to be in a successful title run with 12 games to go and the need to just not collapse. Asking him to be hyper-professional, shaming him in public. Is it the moment? In this situation Núñez is the spirit animal, the hype man, the goodwill mascot, there at the end, beaming and dancing and firing a champagne cork into his own eye.Núñez is also the only part of the entity Slot inherited from Jürgen Klopp that doesn’t really work properly, which adds a slight note of ingratitude. It is important to be clear at this stage. Núñez has not been a success. His transfer fee remains an absurdity.It hasn’t all been bad. He was good last season when Mohamed Salah was injured. But he is also a player who spends a lot of time sprinting away from the game, making all the right runs, just not necessarily in the right order. He misses a lot. He doesn’t have that ice-cold filter. He isn’t a good fit in a high-precision team. The Darwin-verse is a looser, chancier place. It makes him great fun to watch as a neutral, exhilarating and maddening if you’re a supporter, and a one-man heart attack if you’re his manager.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The formerLiverpooldata analyst Ian Graham wrote an interesting book about his time at the club called How To Win the Premier League. Sadio Mané (massive success) is mentioned 50 times, Salah (even massiver success) 41 times and Lionel Messi (random, but great brand recognition) 129 times. Darwin, who was signed on his watch: zero times.But then, Graham has a job to do and a company to promote, not to mention his Pitch Control model designed to “mathematically understand the game the way a professional footballer understands it”, which isn’t really going to fit here. Throw your calculator down the stairs and then stamp on it. This is the best way into the maths of Darwin’s game.View image in fullscreenDarwin Núñez is perhaps the only part of the team Jürgen Klopp left behind that doesn’t really work properly.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAGraham has pointed out in interviews that it was Klopp who made the call on Núñez based on two good performances against Liverpool. And in fairness he also admits that the data said yes, that the model had him as “one of the best young strikers in the world”.This is also significant. In many ways Núñez-to-Liverpool is a victim of modern metrics. What we have here is a set of elite physical attributes crowbarred into the outline of an elite footballer. Take his top speed, his distances covered, a rare combination of height, pace and agility. Add one good goalscoring season. It kind of makes sense in a Klopp attack, although not in a Slot team, where picking Núñez is like living in an immaculate 17th-floor apartment with an overexcited labrador who won’t stop knocking over your laptop, spraying the Barcelona chair with mud, drinking out of the toilet.This is also why Núñez is so much fun to watch. Modern football can be tediously risk-averse and systems-based. Perhaps the real lesson of Núñez is that building a team or trying to understand talent should never go too far one way into either data or feelings. An old-school Kenny Dalglish-style sniff test would probably save you from signing Núñez. The data wanglers could stop you spending £30m on Carroll.There is still a place for Núñez in this world. Probably he should be at a less overclass club, using his energy to disrupt more orderly teams. He may even end up winning Liverpool the league this season in a more arms-length kind of way. There is no doubt Arsenal would be a more potent team right now if they’d taken a chance and splashed out on a goalscorer.Why didn’t they? Because data says this is a risky move that often doesn’t pay? Hmm. And who is the most persuasive current example of this, living proof that when in doubt it’s better to save your money and go for control? Clue: he’s tall and has a ponytail.This is perhaps a stretch. For now, 12 games from the end, there is surely more to be gained from taking it steady with Núñez, from tickling his neck and just making him feel good.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotcommentShareReuse this content"

Sarina Wiegman’s Lionesses began their Nations League campaign with a profligate and frustrating 1-1 draw against Portugal in Portimão.“I’m disappointed about the result,” said the England manager, who also took time after the game to express her solidarity with Spain’s players after Luis Rubialeswas convicted of sexual assaultfor kissing Jenni Hermoso after the World Cup final against England. “I stand with the Spanish players and it’s really sad they have this on their path. They are changing society, and they have so much courage to stand for this and themselves and we stand in solidarity with them. We have the Nations League starting tonight, we are talking about this but we should be talking about the Spanish team and how good they are at football.”In a group with the World Cup holders, also the world’s No 2 side, and Belgium and Portugal, ranked 19th and 22nd in the world respectively, England needed a strong start. But Kika Nazareth’s goal to cancel out Alessia Russo’s first-half effort will be a frustrating and potentially dangerous one. Spain, meanwhile, came from two goals down to earn a 3-2 win over Belgium deep into injury time.Portugal v England: Women’s Nations League – liveRead moreWithout Georgia Stanway, Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood, who are all absent with medium- to long-term injuries, and Beth Mead, who withdrew from the squad late on with a calf injury, Wiegman handed starts to two of England’s brightest young talents. The steady integration with the senior regulars of Manchester United’s Grace Clinton and Manchester City’s Jess Park is gathering pace ahead of the Euros, the injuries quickening the necessity.Against Portugal Clinton shone, her relationship with club teammate Ella Toone and Chelsea’s Keira Walsh growing stronger by the minute. The 21-year-old was metronomic in the first half, and showed her value defensively early on when England failed to clear Joana Marchão’s free-kick and the midfielder made a shot-blocking tackle.Portugal have not been easy prey for England. The last meeting between the two teams came in July 2023, as both sides prepared for the World Cup, andended in a stalemate. Preceding that, a scrappy second-half Mead goal salvaged a win for England in Setúbal in October 2019 – towards the end of Phil Neville’s tenure.In Portimão, on the Algarve, it took 10 minutes for England to find their feet but by the 15-minute mark they were ahead and playing with a fluidity that belied the four-month absence of international football. The goal itself was particularly special, Lauren James’s crossfield ball was met by Lucy Bronze at the byline and the full-back, who is half Portuguese and played with both flags printed on her boots, delivered an unexpected and sumptuous cross in for an unmarked Russo to sidefoot in from close range.View image in fullscreenAlessia Russo tucks home the opening goal for England during their draw.Photograph: Rodrigo Antunes/ReutersClearcut chances were few and far between, Francisco Neto’s side a well-organised unit, but England arguably should have had a penalty moments before the break, Clinton furious after being pulled back as she drove through the middle to meet Russo’s header back across goal. “Yes, honest answer,” said Wiegman on whether she felt it was a penalty, before adding that, regardless, England had enough opportunities outside of that chance to get the second goal.Bronze did not return after half-time, a precaution said Wiegman afterwards, but England struggled to stay ticking.Neto credited the shift in momentum in favour of his side to a change in formation to a 4-4-2. “I felt like the result was really fair for us,” he said. “England had problems before Kika came on in the second half, when we changed formation, we started to dominate the game and felt really comfortable.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But she made England pay for their profligacy in the second half, the substitute shrugging off the challenge of England’s young dynamo before curling the ball into the top corner from just inside the box.Late call-up Chloe Kelly and the Chelsea forward Aggie Beever-Jones were thrown into the mix late on, but it was Portugal that would go closest to a winner, the centre-back pairing Millie Bright and Leah Williamson both called upon to make blocks minutes apart as the clock ticked towards full time.England head to Wembley on Wednesday night to play Spain for the first timesince the World Cup final, while Portugal travel to Belgium. Lose to the world champions, and England will heap the pressure on themselves as they head into April’s fixtures, their inability to escape the group stage last season, and failure to qualify for the Olympics as a result, weighing heavy.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Nations LeagueEngland women's football teamPortugal women’s football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Everton have picked up 13 points from a possible 18 since Moyes, the former United manager, replaced Sean Dyche in mid-January. It has been a far less seamless transition at United with Amorim struggling to implement his tactics amid a litany of problems on and off the pitch.David Moyes v Ruben Amorim: the pragmatist meets the ideologueRead more“David Moyes is doing a better job than me, it’s quite simple,” said Amorim, who did accept “the pressure is not the same” at the two clubs. Asked why Moyes has been able to build momentum, he said: “Small things like winning one game, winning two games, that belief. We have to give merit to the players of Everton and especially to the coach.“If we win two games or even if we win one game – the next one at Everton – everything changes slowly. When you win it’s so much easier to take the doubts out of the minds of the players.”Amorim has never shied away from criticising his side in public and admitted to feeling angry with recent performances. He also disagreed with the notion that United are wedded to a 3-4-3 formation, saying his system was not just about the number of defenders.He said: “Sometimes it’s frustrating and when you hear out loud four wins in 14 games for Manchester United, even in another club, it’s really frustrating and you get frustrated and angry.“We worked so many years with this system I don’t see it as back three, five or four. I think we can adapt, but I’m passing the principles and then we go forward. I don’t see the system as three or five defenders. I see principles that we can change and this way of playing we can adapt to a different system.When I changed [at former club] Casa Piait was because I believed it was something I needed to do, I just know how to do things I believe [in].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Palkin claimed the world governing body had kept its doors “closed to us” and he repeated previous entreaties for the creation of a fund to help maintain a sport that has endured severe physical and financial damage. He also urged Fifa and Uefa to hold firm on their commitment to bar Russian teams from international competitions amid an increasingly precarious geopolitical climate.Liverpool face PSG as Champions League last-16 draw sets up Madrid derbyRead more“From the beginning of the warFifanever supported Ukrainian football,” Palkin told the Guardian. “They always had a slogan that we are one family, but it was not one family. They forgot about Ukrainian football completely.“We need to set up some kind of fund for Ukrainian football and the major donors should be Fifa. They should support us because we have a lot of destroyed infrastructure and a poor economic situation in the industry. It’s difficult to survive in these conditions and it’s strange they completely ignore what’s going on inUkraine. For me, it’s some kind of shame.”Palkin claimed there had been a reluctance on Fifa’s part to get around the table and discuss Ukraine’s plight. “Fifa’s door is always closed for us,” he said. “We tried to knock at this door in the last three years but there were no answers at all. I contacted some people at a high level in football and they also tried to communicate with Fifa, but I don’t feel we have success.”Shakhtar sought £43m of damages from Fifa in 2022 after it ruled that foreign players in Ukraine could suspend their contracts because of the invasion, essentially depriving clubs of potentially hefty transfer fees. They eventually lost their case at the court of arbitration for sport. “Fifa ignored Ukraine and our clubs,” Palkin said.Asked why he believed Fifa may be reluctant to create a reparations fund or provide further assistance, Palkin said: “In the past three years many people asked the same question, but I don’t know at all. We can make guesses, but I don’t have the answer.”View image in fullscreenInfantino and Trump in 2018.

Shevchenko acknowledged the value of existing Fifa programmes, such as the Fifa Forward campaign, in backing the sport’s development in Ukraine. The Fifa Foundation has also helped deliver humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, allocating $1m to the cause in March 2022.Palkin was speaking days before the anniversary of the full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022, which savagely escalated a decade-long war that has forced Shakhtar to play away from their home city since 2014. Fifa and Uefa acted swiftly three years ago to prevent Russian sides playing in their competitions but, in a fraught international climate and with a volatile US administration appearing openly hostile to Ukraine, Palkin reiterated the need for them to hold the line.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is scant chance of such an occurrence and Palkin said the authorities’ stance must remain while the war continues.“At this moment I don’t feel Fifa or Uefa would like to give permission to Russian clubs to participate in European competition,” he said. “Maybe they have separate conversations but officially they keep their position. For Ukraine it’s very important to have a strong position from Fifa and Uefa in respect of Russian teams. It’s not possible, when you invade a country, that at the same time you’re free to do whatever you want.”Palkin does not see danger in the proximity between Fifa and the US government. “For us the face of Fifa didn’t change since the beginning of the war. I don’t know what kind of relationships they have, but I don’t feel any changes regarding Ukrainian football. I don’t understand how it can be worse and I don’t feel it’s become better.”Fifa was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsShakhtar DonetskEuropean club footballFifaUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

The club have been quiet in the market since Slot replaced Jürgen Klopp but he has pinpointed the positions the team need to upgrade.OnlyFederico Chiesa has arrived at Anfield under Slot, although a deal has been agreed for thegoalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili to join from Valencia.

I’m not going to tell you which positions we prefer, but it is clear that we’ve assessed the squad, we’ve assessed what we think where we can improve, and that’s where we try to go for in the summer.”Matters are complicated by Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold being out of contract in June. If any were to depart, it would put a different spin on the summer’s transfer activity as Liverpool would need to seek replacements.Liverpool defeated City 2-0 in December, inflicting a fourth straight loss in the Premier League on the reigning champions, who have endured a difficult season by their standards.

Having played a short pass to Josh Cullen, Edwards received the return, benefited from a ricochet off Shea Charles and showed neat footwork before producing a close-range finish.Swansea crave end to crisis after self-inflicted slump and parade of exitsRead moreIt was a cruel way for Danny Röhl’s team to fall behind after they had made light of Burnley’s incredible defensive record this season. The opening 34 league games have seen the Clarets concede just nine goals. Wednesday missed three great chances to end Burnley’s run of 11 games and 1,000 minutes without conceding in the first 19 minutes alone.Michael Ihiekwe produced a shot which clipped the outside of a post, the winger Djeidi Gassama crossed for Stuart Armstrong, who put a six-yard shot wide, before Gassama was again the architect, this time setting up Josh Windass, whose effort flew wide via the defender Maxime Esteve.Wednesday started the second half as they had the first, with Windass and Armstrong both having glorious chances blocked by defenders. As had been the case earlier, Wednesday paid for those misses with Brownhill scoring with his first touch after coming on as a 62nd-minute substitute. Burnley maintained the pressure from a half-cleared corner, with Josh Laurent sending Jaidon Anthony away down the right and his cross being met by Brownhill, who scored from close range.Roberts was somehow unmarked to add a third after 70 minutes, side-footing in from another Anthony cross. Benson marked his first appearance since injury in September when he was allowed space on the edge of the area to curl in a fantastic finish.Meanwhile, the substitute George Earthy netted a 10-minute second-half double asBristol Citycame from behind to leap into the Championship playoff spots with a thrilling 2-1 victory overMiddlesbroughat Ashton Gate. The West Ham loanee, a 63rd-minute replacement for Anis Mehmeti, fired in from Cam Pring’s cross nine minutes later and then tapped home the rebound when Scott Twine’s 82nd-minute free-kick came back off the bar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the Conference League, Chelsea were drawn with Copenhagen.Arne Slot’sLiverpoolwill host the second leg of their meeting with PSG at Anfield, giving them a potential advantage against opponents who have clicked into form after a stuttering start in this season’s competition. PSG put 10 goals past their compatriots Brest in the playoffs and finished the league phase with impressive wins over Manchester City and Stuttgart. Nonetheless, Liverpool can point to a league phase in which they beat Real Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen and Milan.Liverpool’s head coach said of the draw: “As is the case with ourselves, PSG are top of their domestic league and are enjoying a long unbeaten run. This tells us all that we need to know about the challenge that we will face but it is also a challenge that we will look forward to, knowing that we also fully deserve to be in the last 16.”Arsenal, who will have their ­second leg at home, play PSV for the third consecutive season. Those ­earlier meetings were in Europa League and Champions League group-stage games, Mikel Arteta’s side winning two and losing once before most recently drawing 1-1 in December 2023.

That match was literally handed to the Belgian side when Tyrone Mings picked the ball up from a short goal-kick, thinking play had not restarted, and was punished when Hans Vanaken scored the resulting penalty. Brugge played some exceptional football in overcoming a fancied Atalanta 5-2 on aggregate in the playoffs.Should Liverpool and Villa both prevail, they will face each other for an all-English quarter-final in April. If Arsenal go through they will play the winners of Real’s mouthwatering clash with Atlético, which is a rerun of the 2014 and 2016 finals.

Arteta must decide whether to start the Spain midfielder in attack against West Ham on Saturday or stick with Sterling as Arsenal attempt to cut Liverpool’s lead to five points.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreTheArsenalmanager would not confirm who would get the nod but backed Sterling not to be affected by criticism.“Raheem is so experienced, and like many other players, we know that what you did yesterday is not whether it was really good or not,” he said. “That could be relevant to the next game, to the next action. He’s fully focused, he’s trained really well this week and [is] ready to go again.”Asked whether he felt the 30-year-old could still have a big impact at Arsenal, Arteta said: “Yes and he has to have it because we really need him.” But Arteta was hardly convincing when it was put to him that Sterling, who has scored only one goal, in aCarabao Cup win over Bolton, was lacking confidence.“Hopefully not, because we try to give him as much as possible, but that’s a question for him,” he said. “But we are all behind him, we are the best for him and it’s going to be really important and we need his best. And we need the players only with that mindset to be here to impact the team.”Liverpool’s two successivemidweek 2-2 drawshave given Arsenal a sliver of hope that they are not destined to finish as runners-up for a third season in a row despite injuries to a number of key attacking players. Arteta is hoping that the late win over Leicester has helped to galvanise his squad.“It’s been very re-energising to say: ‘OK, let’s see if we can do that together again and whatever gaps we have within the team, we’re going to fill them in a different way with different players in different ways,’” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Who is going to fill those minutes?’ You start to generate a lot of options; some of them more realistic and some of them thinking in a completely different way. And what re-energised me is the team – the staff, the players – looking at them, that if I tell them to play in any position or do anything then I know they are ready for it.”Asked whether he would prefer to be chased by Liverpool than be chasing them, he added: “I prefer to depend on me, because when you depend on somebody else there are too many factors. But it feels different, it feels like we can generate the right momentum and a team with these performances is able to convince [themselves] that we can do it, which is a big factor, because suddenly we feel really strong.

His performances have played a key role in the club reaching the last 16 of the Champions League after finishing seventh in the league phase.Champions League last 16: PSG v Liverpool, PSV v Arsenal, Club Brugge v Villa – liveRead moreWest Ham looked last summer at signing David, who helped Lille win Ligue 1 in 2021. They moved on to other targets after being priced out of a move but have continued to monitor him. It remains to be seen whether West Ham will be able to meet David’s wage demands. He is proven in the Champions League and has scored more than 100 goals since joining Lille from Gent five years ago.West Ham have found it difficult to enhance their options in attack in recent years. Niclas Füllkrug has struggled with form and fitness since joining from Borussia Dortmund last summer and remains sidelined by a hamstring injury. The veteran forwardMichail Antonio was injuredin a car crash in December and there is no timeline on his return. Danny Ings, who has made little impact since joining two years ago, is out of favour.Potter was forced into the market after his appointment as head coach last month and eventually landed the Brighton striker Evan Ferguson on loan. West Ham do not have an option to buy Ferguson, who made his debut in last weekend’s defeat by Brentford, and are aware their chances of agreeing a permanent deal for the 20-year-old this summer are low.West Ham are 16th before visiting Arsenal on Saturday afternoon. Potter has won one of his first six games and his options are limited because of injuries to key players.The Dutch winger Crysencio Summerville has experienced a setback in his recovery from a hamstring injury and Lucas Paquetá is out for up to four weeks after injuring an ankle in training this week.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedLillenewsShareReuse this content"

Moyes was sacked only 10 months after succeedingSir Alex Fergusonat Old Trafford and described the setback as “part of life as a football manager. You have to find a way back and that’s what I had to do after the disappointment of losing my job at Manchester United.”‘Moyes is doing a better job than me,’ admits Manchester United’s AmorimRead moreEverton sit above Ruben Amorim’s team in thePremier Leaguetable after winning four of their six league games under Moyes. The Scot has been reinvigorated back at Goodison, but admits he is a different manager from the one who left Everton for United in 2013.Moyes said: “Maybe a bit calmer. That comes as you get older – you can’t be quite as full on. It’s very hard for me to go to every under-21 game and under-18 game now, which I would have done in the past. But the job of being a manager means there is much more work than there was 15, 20 years ago. There is much more regarding debriefing and dealing with more players. There’s more media too. Things change and you’ve got to try and change with it.“Sometimes a bit more experience helps. Sometimes you can calm yourself down, but don’t take my calmness as meaning I’m not passionate with that. I’m also using more people to help me now as well, so it’s not all left to the manager. We’ve got a lot of coaches and we can take bits of information from each other and help. Have I changed? Maybe a bit. I’m not having to fight the world all the time now, which when you first come in you feel as if you need to.”While Amorim has stuck to his principles of playing 3-4-3 since replacing Erik ten Hag in November, despite United’s poor results and inheriting a squad unsuited to the system, Moyes believes a more pragmatic approach is required when taking over midway through a season.“I’ve had to adjust a little bit to what’s available,” he said. “I think when you take over a team during the season you have to find a way of getting the best results. We certainly did because we’ve been in a position where we’ve been too close to the bottom three. But I have to say the players, whatever we’ve done, whatever we’ve asked them to do, have been fantastic. They’ve gone about their job brilliantly well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lehecka had stunned Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals in Doha and looked on course to claim another scalp when he won the first set.Draper required a tie-break to get the match back on level terms before he showed his class in the decider to take victory by a 3-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3 score.Both Lehecka and Draper had spent more than two hours on court for their last-eight triumphs, but it did not prevent a high-quality start to their semi-final. A number of powerful blows were mixed in with touches of finesse with one particular Draper drop shot in the sixth game getting the crowd off their feet.Sports quiz of the week: fights, shocks, records, mistakes and a comebackRead moreThe former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was among those in attendance, but it failed to bring any initial luck for London-born Draper as Lehecka struck with his only break point of the first set to move in front.Draper impressively kept his composure and after a nip-and-tuck second set, he upped his play in the tie-break to force a decider. This was Draper’s first tournament since he retired from the Australian Open with a hip issue, but he repeatedly outlasted Lehecka in several rallies to take control of the third set.A first break was swiftly followed by a second as Draper edged out his Czech opponent in two hours and 23 minutes to set up a final clash against fifth seed Andrey Rublev on Saturday. World No 16 Draper has claimed eight victories from nine matches in 2025, with three of them five-set wins at the Australian Open to highlight his improved resilience.“End of last year, I started to pick up some real momentum and was playing good tennis. I was building it and then – all of a sudden – I couldn’t play for about a month,” Draper said, with reference to a recent hip injury.“I went out to Australia and my level was all over the place, but it gave me a lot of confidence coming through those five-set matches. Mentally that was really good for me, even though my tennis wasn’t there. When I came back it was about getting the tennis right, getting my body in the right place and building on that fitness I had done in Melbourne. Coming here, I felt better about my tennis and even better about my body.”Rublev has triumphed in all three of his meetings with Draper and booked his place in the final with a 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (5) win over Félix Auger-Aliassime.The Russian teenage sensation Mirra Andreeva continued her giant-slaying exploits at the DubaiTennisChampionships by upsetting the sixth seed Elena Rybakina 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 in the semi-finals on Friday.View image in fullscreenMirra Andreeva became the youngest player to beat three grand slam winners at a single event since compatriot Maria Sharapova in 2004.Photograph: Christopher Pike/Getty ImagesDenmark’s Clara Tauson set up a final showdown with Andreeva after overcoming Karolina Muchovaha 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-3.Andreeva, who had stunned five-time grand slam champion Iga Swiatek in the quarters and former Wimbledon winner Marketa Vondrousova in the round of 32, is the youngest player to reach a WTA 1000 Final. The 17-year-old French Open semi-finalist also becomes the youngest player to beat three grand slam winners at a single event since her compatriot Maria Sharapova in 2004.Rybakina, ranked seventh in the world, let a slender 2-1 lead slip in a tight opening set as momentum swung back and forth before Andreeva came out on top. However, Rybakina forced a decider after a close second set where she had built a 4-3 lead and just as she looked to run away with the win after racing to a 3-1 lead in the final set, Andreeva roared back to win five successive games. With the victory, world No 14 Andreeva also avenged her 2023 Beijing last-16 defeat by Rybakina.“Last time we played it was a really tough match … she went for her shots and killed me in the end,” Andreeva said. “This time I knew she’d hit hard. I tried to fight for every point and kept believing.”Explore more on these topicsTennisJack DrapernewsShareReuse this content"

She posted a picture of that on her Instagram with emojis of a Canadian flag and a flexed muscle.“I just put it on there so if I ever had a moment and I kind of froze, I would be able to look at my hand and see it,” Kreviazuk said. “I’d love to see people sort of get inspired and catch the fire and say their heart more in their art. ... Sometimes you just got to speak the truth in your art and it’s awesome. That’s what it should be about.”The NHL declined comment on the situation.Fans in Boston lightly booed the song, though it was soon drowned out by Kreviazuk’s singing. The crowd in Montrealbooed the Star-Spangled Bannerprior to US tournament games at Bell Centre last week, more vociferously before the team faced Canada.Tensions have risen between the neighbors and longtime allies over the past several weeks as Trump since being inaugurated has suggested multiple times that Canada become the 51st US state, in relation to a trade dispute, and threatened a series of tariffs.

The fans who remained, many of them in their red Team Canada jerseys, sang along.Connor McDavid scored at 8:18 of overtime to give Canadaa 3-2 victory over the United Stateson Thursday night as the North American rivals turned what had been a tune-up for the 2026 Olympics into a geopolitical brawl over anthems and annexation as much as international hockey supremacy.Or, to put it another way: It was the 51st US state 3, Canada’s 11th province 2.“You can’t take our country – and you can’t take our game,” Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeauposted on Xin a cross-border callback to US president Donald Trump’s chatter about turning one of the United States’ closest allies into a 51st state. Earlier Thursday, Trump had called him ‘Governor Trudeau’.”A lot of stuff going on with Canada and the USA right now, and us playing against each other was kind of a perfect storm for our sport,” said Nathan MacKinnon, who was selected the MVP of the new tournament with four goals in four games. “It was much more popular than even we would have imagined.

Just to know what it means to us. I know it’s just a quick tournament, and it’s not an Olympic gold medal or anything like that, but it means the world to our group, as you can see,” McDavid said.“I hope [the new fans] love it,” he said. “It’s a great game, it’s a great sport and I hope we put on a good show these last couple days and gained some fans, ultimately. You can’t ask for a better show than that.”Brady Tkachuk and Jake Sanderson scored for the Americans, and Connor Hellebuyck stopped 22 shots in regulation and three more in OT. The US have lost all but one game against Canada in best-on-best international play dating to the preliminary round of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics; the lone victory wasin the 4 Nations round-robin on Saturday, a game so good it turned Thursday’s sequel into one of the most anticipated international hockey events in decades.View image in fullscreenAdam Fox of Team USA, left, skates with the puck against Mitchell Marner of Team Canada during the first period.Photograph: Chase Agnello-Dean/4NFO/World Cup of Hockey/Getty Images“I think guys that are at home watching this, I’m hoping they’re wanting a piece of it,” US forward Dylan Larkin said. “This grew the game really well, but I hope it pushes guys to want a piece of this and then the next generation that got to watch this, they’re going to watch the Olympics next year and hopefully there’s a different outcome.”The already ripe rivalry between the two North American hockey powers took on an added intensity during the tournament following Trump’s tariff threats and talk of making Canada the 51st US state. Trump called the American team Thursday morning to wish it well, then turned to Truth Social to take a poke at “Governor Trudeau”.The political backdrop combined with the quality of the round-robin game, which the United States won 3-1 on Saturday, to bring the atmosphere of a Stanley Cup final orOlympic gold medal gameto the TD Garden.Fans in their team jerseys waved flags, shouted for their countrymen and continued the ritual booing of the opposing national anthem that has become an nightly undercard for a tournament that was the return of NHL stars to the international scene after missing the last two Winter Olympics.View image in fullscreenCanada’s Connor McDavid celebrates his game-winning goal.Photograph: Ben Jackson/4NFO/World Cup of Hockey/Getty ImagesThe American fans chanted “U-S-A! U-S-A!” to spur on the home team; in the third period, a cheer of “Johnny Hockey! Johnny Hockey!” reminded the players that they were playing for the memory of former Boston College and Calgary Flames star Johnny Gaudreau, whowas killed by a drunk driverwhile bicycling in New Jersey at his sister’s wedding last summer.“Miracle on Ice” Olympic hero and honorary US captain Mike Eruzione wore a Gaudreau jersey during a pregame ceremonial puck drop with Canadian counterpart Wayne Gretzky.“We wanted this one,” Canada forward Mark Stone said. “You’ve got 40 million Canadians, sitting at home, and you feel the energy.

And from someone who complains about lack of honesty from the mainstream media,” the 48-year-old European Space Agency astronaut, who has flown to the ISS twice, wrote on X.In response, Musk called Mogensen “fully retarded”. He saidSpaceX, which he owns, could have brought the astronauts back “several months ago” and that he had made such an offer to the Biden administration. Musk did not elaborate on what that offer entailed.What does Elon Musk believe?Read moreWilmore and Williams flew to the ISS in June onboard a Boeing Starliner for what was meant to be an eight-day test mission to certify the new spaceship. However, thruster problems led Nasa to decide that the Starliner should return without its crew, and the agency tasked SpaceX with bringing the veteran astronauts home.Nasa then announced the pair would return on the SpaceX Crew-9 mission’s spaceship, which launched in September with a crew of two instead of four in order to accommodate them.The voyage home was initially scheduled for February but later shifted to March due to delays by SpaceX in preparing the spacecraft for Crew-10, whose crew will replace Crew-9’s. If there was an alternate rescue plan that could have been executed sooner, Musk has not revealed it.Replying to Musk, Mogensen – who flew onboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule during a 2023 mission to the ISS – said: “Elon, I have long admired you and what you have accomplished, especially at SpaceX and Tesla.“You know as well as I do, that Butch and Suni are returning with Crew-9, as has been the plan since last September. Even now, you are not sending up a rescue ship to bring them home. They are returning on the Dragon capsule that has been on ISS since last September.”As well as being the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, and owning X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk leads the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), an advisory department under the Trump administration.In 2019, a court in Los Angelesfound Musk not guiltyof defaming the British cave explorer Vernon Unsworth, after a Twitter spat over the 2018 Thailand cave rescue during which Musk called Unsworth a “pedo guy”. Musk’s attorneys had argued that the tweet was not a statement of fact, but an insult, which is considered protected speech.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkElon MuskInternational Space StationSpaceJoe BidenEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It still has a great 6.2in screen, three cameras on the back, flat aluminium sides and glass front and back. That makes it the most compact of high-end Android phones available, competing with Apple’s iPhone on size where others includingGoogle’s Pixel 9have grown steadily larger.View image in fullscreenThe regular S25 is significantly smaller and lighter than its superphone sibling the S25 Ultra.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianWith its small size comes a smaller battery than most modern Androids, althoughSamsungdoes well to squeeze a solid 37 hours out of the S25. In general use on a mix of 5G and wifi, and actively using the screen for more than six hours, I had to charge the phone every other day. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip makes the S25 one of the fastest phones available and is great for games, but playing them significantly dents the battery life.AI upgradesThe big changes for the S25 are all software and AI-based. It runs the same latest version of One UI 7 (Android 15) as the S25 Ultra, including various new AI tools that expand on writing, summarisation and drawing toolsintroduced last year.Most of the new tools are designed to either anticipate what you want to do to find information you might need ahead of time or to perform multiple complex tasks on your phone via text or voice commands.View image in fullscreenGemini has replaced Bixby and Google Assistant on the S25 and is far more capable.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianGoogle’snext-generation Gemini assistantis the biggest upgrade, able to interact with information from the web and apps on your phone to get things done without you having to manually tap buttons. Ask it to put the date into your calendar from a party invitation flyer that has been texted to you and it can do so. It can find restaurant recommendations and send them to a friend as a suggestion for dinner with a simple voice command. It can also understand what is on your screen from text, photos and videos to answer questions, find out more information or perform actions.It can be almost magical when it works. But it can’t be relied on to get things right every time. Sometimes it trips up on trivial things such as different spellings of names, and it can confidently hallucinate information that looks good on first glance but is in fact totally wrong. Neither Google nor Samsung has solved these fundamental problems that plague all AI bots at the moment.Samsung’snew “Now” bar at the bottom of the lock screenis more successful as a useful place where timely information widgets, timers, media-playing controls and other handy bits appear. You can swipe through a stack of them to see what’s happening or quickly change track.Samsung will support the S25 with software and security updatesfor seven years from release, which matches the best from Google and Apple.SpecificationsMain screen:6.2in FHD+ Dynamic Amoled 2X 120HzProcessor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyRAM:12GBStorage:128, 256 or 512GBOperating system:One UI 7 (Android 15)Camera:50MP + 12MP 0.6x + 10MP 3x; 12MP front-facingConnectivity:5G, USB-C, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4, UWB and GNSSWater resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 mins)Dimensions:146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2mmWeight:162gSustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe S25 has wireless and USB-C charging, reaching 50% in 25 minutes and full power in just over an hour (power adaptor not included).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSamsung does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity.The phone isgenerally repairable. Screen repairscost £149 by authorised service centresand include a battery replacement. Samsung also offers aself-repair programme.The phone contains multiple recycled materials including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare earth elements and steel.

The main is the best and can produce some great shots, although it has a tendency to over-brighten some scenes, causing highlights to be blown out, such as bright direct light washing out shots of people. The 2x zoom is improved on the S24 with slightly more detail, while the 3x zoom is solid, although short on reach compared with the 5x cameras common on slightly more expensive rivals. The ultrawide is equally solid and rounds out a good but not groundbreaking package.The S25 shoots equally good video, excellent portraits and has plenty of modes with one exception: no macrophotography mode, which is disappointing. Overall, the S25 has a good camera system. It won’t trouble aPixel 9 ProoriPhone 16 Probut it’s great for the size and money.PriceThe Samsung Galaxy S25 costs from£799(€919/$799.99/A$1,399).For comparison, theGalaxy S25 Ultracosts£1,249, the S25+ costs£999, theGoogle Pixel 9costs£649, theOnePlus 13costs£899and theiPhone 16costs£799.VerdictThe Galaxy S25 is the last really good small Android phone standing. Where competitors have grown ever bigger, the Samsung feels refreshingly light, thin and narrow in the hand without having a tiny screen.As withits supersized sibling, the design feels like the endpoint for standard high-end phones, which means barely anything has changed in the last few years. The switch to Qualcomm’s new top chip makes for a significant performance boost. But the rest is down to software introducing more advanced AI tools, which can be spectacular when they work but frequently can’t be trusted. They will also make their way to older Samsung S-series phones over the next couple of months, which makes last year’s S24 more tempting.But if you’re after the smallest flagship Android going that’s actually good, the S25 is it.Pros:compact size, good 6.2in screen, decent camera, good software with seven years’ support, top Android chip, access to the latest AI features, cheapest Samsung flagship model.Cons:iterative design, no 5x zoom, battery life short of larger models, AI capabilities overhyped for now.View image in fullscreenOneUI 7 has had a bit of a jazz up but remains familiar to anyone who has previously used a Samsung or standard Android phone.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsSamsungSmartphonesAndroidMobile phonesArtificial intelligence (AI)reviewsShareReuse this content"

It won’t workMike WilliamsThe steel industry needs to modernize. Tariffs can help, but the government must go beyond trade policyFri 21 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTShareLast week,Donald Trumprevived a trade war from his first term, implementing a 25% tariff on all imported steel. In doing so, he’s using tariffs as a blunt-force tool under the assumption that they’ll be sufficient to jump-start the American steel industry.But that’s not the case.Tariffs are important, but they’re far from enough. Thanks to decades of disinvestment and terrible trade policies, the steel industry has grappled with decline and stagnation for years. It now faces grave threats asChinacontinues to flood the global market with artificially cheap steel, manipulating prices in its favor. Meanwhile, the global market has begun a shift towards “clean” steel produced with electricity and hydrogen, a process the United States has onlyjust startedto support.To survive, the steel industry must modernize. To support that effort, the federal government should be implementing targeted tariffs alongside investments and incentives that help the industry grow and transition.Strategic tariffs can help protect steel manufacturing from excessive overcapacity and unfair price manipulation by foreign competitors. They can also be used to account for other effects, such as the impact of high-emissions steel production on health and the environment. For example, a tariff that considers carbon emissions in the production of a given unit of steel would help protect the domestic steel industry from foreign competitors’ cheap, high-emissions steel. TheEuropean Unionis alreadyimplementingthis kind of tariff, called acarbon-border adjustment mechanism. Revenue from this tariff – and others – could help our steel industry transition to clean technologies and accelerate the industry’s modernization.Unless Trump expands his strategy to include incentives and investment for the steel industry, his approach will be like a game of JengaWhen tariffs are used for negotiation without being combined with other government tools, they can backfire. Already,Canadaand theEUare preparing reciprocal tariffs on American steel and aluminum, which will make American steel even less desirable in those markets. Steel is a critical material in countless supply chains, from cars and planes to housing and infrastructure, and across-the-board increases in steel prices carry widespread economic risks. Trump’s 2018 tariffs on steel provide a roadmap for what we can expect: while production temporarily ticked up, exports declined almost25%between 2018 and 2020, and after retaliation from China and Mexico, economistsdowngradedgrowth estimates, and business investment slowed.Tariffs are necessary for correcting distortions in global trade but are a poor tool for catalyzing the kind of investment needed for the long-term viability of the American steel industry, which needs to transition to clean technology to remain competitive globally. While tariffs can protect existing production capacity from being undercut, they won’t necessarily yield large infrastructure and modernization investments from domestic steel companies already operating at slim margins.But just as it has started to do for ourdomestic semiconductor industry, the federal government can combine fortified trade policies with structural support for the steel industry’s transformation. This could include investment tax credits for revamping steel-production facilities to use clean technologies and production tax credits for making domestic clean steel, spurring private investment across the steel industry.The federal government could leverage existing policies as well. For example, expanding the Biden administration’s “Buy America” requirements for federally funded projects, such as highway and bridge construction, to include domestically produced, 100% clean steel would strengthen demand for US-produced steel. Reviving “Buy Clean” standards for steel used in federal projects could also accelerate the industry’s modernization. These structural supports could be funded by the revenue from targeted, well-designed tariffs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The press must show unityFri 21 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 14.03 ESTShareIt might seem like a small matter, just a disagreement over whether a body of water should be called one name or another.But it’s really about much bigger things: Trump-style intimidation, a clear violation of the first amendment – and the extent to which news organizations will stick together in each other’s defense, or will comply with the powerful for the sake of their own access.Even more broadly, it is aboutDonald Trump’swide-ranging effort to control the media and be able to spread propaganda and interfere with the flow of accurate information.The disagreement started soon after the presidentdecided unilaterallythat the Gulf of Mexico was to be called the Gulf of America. Theexecutive orderwas one more display of Trump’s capricious and imperious way of doing things; his first month has been a relentless exercise in chaos and norm-destruction.It’s time for Americans to withhold their taxes | Judith LevineRead moreAfter the Associated Press, the global news organization, decided to stick with using the long-established name which makes sense to its international readership, the Trump White House determined that punishment was in order.An AP reporter wasbarred from a White House press event, and since then, things have only escalated. More AP reporters barred from briefings and from the president’s plane. Access denied.What’s happening is ugly. In the US, the government doesn’t get to dictate the language journalists use in their stories. There’s a little thing called the first amendment to the US constitution that prohibits this. But theTrump administration, as usual, has its own – often unconstitutional and sometimes illegal – ideas.The actions against the AP are “retribution, plain and simple, and a shameful attempt to bully the press into ideological compliance”, said Tim Richardson of PEN America.On Thursday, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press sent aletter to the White Housesigned by 30 news organizations, and the White House Correspondents Association is similarly registering its displeasure.But letters – even signed by many and ever so strongly worded – are easy to ignore. The solution, if there is one, will require more forceful measures: lawsuits and journalistic solidarity that might include a widespread boycotting of White House press briefings.Trump isn’t a narcissist – he’s a solipsist. And it means a few simple things | John R MacArthurRead moreAfter all, compliance is a slippery slope. What happens, for example, when Trump proclaims that Ukraine is no longer Ukraine, but to be simply called Russia? Do news organizations politely accept the rewriting of history?“What do the media do then,” queried the longtime environmental journalist Andrew Revkin, “agree to those terms so they can stay in the briefing room?”Why stop there? How about declaring by fiat that the Washington monument is now to be called the Trump monument? Why not chisel another presidential face onto Mount Rushmore and call it Mount Donald?The great renaming has begun, and George Orwell would understand exactly what’s going on.A few days ago, a media leader I admire – Jim Friedlich, the CEO of the Lenfest Institute, a non-profit organization that owns the Philadelphia Inquirer – proposed a notion that deserves serious consideration. There should be, he wrote, a “NATO for News,” in which every legitimate news organization formally pledges to defend the others. This happens now, from time to time, but Friedlich has something more deliberate in mind, he wrote in the Inquirer.All of this is happening within a larger and quite alarming anti-press context.Trump’s sidekickElon Muskrecently fantasized about a “long prison sentence” for journalists on CBS’s 60 Minutes, which has been under fire for its (normal and conventional) editing of a pre-election interview with Kamala Harris.Trump has sued the Pulitzer prize board for statements in defense of its awards to the Washington Post and the New York Times for their coverage of Trump’s relationship with Russia; he’s sued the Des Moines Register over a pre-election public opinion poll. And the Pentagon recently tossed eight traditional news organizations from office spaces to make room for pro-Maga outlets.“The Trump administration has decided that it will actively wield access as a tool to reshape the media landscape in its favor,” Oliver Darcy wrote in his media newsletter,Status. It surely will also use more legal threats and actions.Given that we’re only a month into this brave new world, some unity and stiff-spined resolve are very much in order.That won’t be easy.

But we cannot give upFri 21 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 14.03 ESTShareAmonth into Trump 2.0, pushback fromDemocratsand civil society remains surprisingly weak. Common diagnoses as to why make it all about psychology: the problem is that “shock and awe” have immobilized the opposition; Democrats are said to bedemoralized; and everyone is supposedly just exhausted. But the issue is a failure of political judgment, a basic misunderstanding of the moment and of the potential for effective opposition.To begin with, it has become conventional wisdom that the first “resistance” was somehow cringe; those nowdismissing itlike to credit themselves as savvy. But there was in fact much effective organizing – from the Women’s March tothe patient long-term effortsthat were rewarded in 2020. Of course, these were not solely responsible for preventing the plutocratic power grab we are witnessing now: back then,Donald Trumphad neither a plan nor the personnel he has today. But the casual dismissal of opposition under Trump 1.0 is an unforced error.And so is the concession that the 2024 vote constituted what Amy Klobuchar called a “change election”. True, it had genuine shock value: everyone knew that Trump was an aspiring authoritarian devoted only to dollars and domination (and, more specifically, the ideology of white supremacy); yet almost half of those who bothered to go to the polls still voted for him. But to construe the outcome as a landslide à la Reagan 1984 is empirically wrong and politically suicidal. It also does not work as part of a kitschy “we heard you, the people” script. If what the people wanted to say was “lower the price of eggs”, nothing much follows from that for strategies to prevent autocracy; if it was “we liked the racism that was on full display at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally”, there is not much reason to listen, let alone to be responsive to the message.Instead, Democrats should be true to their own message from the campaign, for it has been vindicated: Trump is proving an existential threat to democracy. Rather than providing running commentary on egg prices, as Chuck Schumer has been doing, or indeed cringe-worthy rallies with chants of “We will win” (also Schumer), Democratic party elites should pursue a three-pronged strategy: first, do everything possible in Congress to slow down the power grab. Deny all support to Trump’s nominees, gum up the works, do not help with the budget and the debt ceiling.Centrists will complain that such an approach fails to signal bipartisanship; yet all attempts to establishreciprocity– “we support your half-way normal nominees, if you reject Patel and Gabbard” – have failed. If democracy is at stake, standard tactics – and the kind ofconsultant advicethat might have worked for Clinton in the 90s – have a real drawback: they communicate that, after all, things are still pretty normal. Citizens take cues from elites. If elites act normally, why should everyone else be that concerned?True, failure to raise the debt ceiling could have catastrophic consequences. But the fact is thatElon Muskis already sabotaging the American state (andundermining trustin US treasuries); and it is the duty of Republicans – who control all branches – to rein him in and prevent a default. Everyone knows that expectations vis-à-vis the parties are asymmetrical: Democrats must be the adults in the room; the Republican party has license to feature Marjorie Taylor Greene, Tommy Tuberville and the assorted fanatics in the Freedom caucus. Accepting this basic asymmetry – and some politicians never facing consequences for their conduct – is part of what has brought us to this moment.A second prong is, of course, lawsuits. Courts are crucial, but, across the globe, the judiciaryhardly has a great recordof preserving democracy. Trumpist judges will give the administration a pass; more shockingly, perhaps, courts are also often sensitive to public opinion. Democrats relying on procedures and arcane paragraphs is not enough: there is obviously more to politics than performance, but all politics is also performative, and one cannot perform proceduralism.Prominent figures need to explain and excoriate the illegal sabotaging of state capacity, ideally with pithy slogans (maybe “Stop the Stealing”?) and gut-wrenching examples: our kids will get sick; we won’t get federal help in disasters; some will die in plane crashes. Over the top? One of the 20th century’s most memorable political clips – LBJ’s 1964 “Daisy” presidential campaign ad – featured a young girl to bring home the perils posed by a Barry Goldwater trigger-happy with nuclear weapons. A moment of existential danger is not a time to shy away from political attacks to indulge aesthetic revulsions to attack politics.Finally: people on the streets. There isclear evidencethat mass protests against the far right canhave an effect. True, ralliesmight be met with repression; but refraining from mass assemblies will not make authoritarianism go away, it will solidify it. Surveys show thatmajoritiesare unhappy with Trump and Musk (but also with Democratic leadership). Being overly tactical in opposition will make people feel gaslit. While strategy is about smart use of resources – and protest requires carefully chosen focal points – doing a lot at the same time can have benefits: Steve Bannon advocated “flooding the zone with shit” (now politely called “shock and awe”); sometimes you have to reverse the flow of shit and flood the other side.What’s giving me hope nowIt’s important to remember Martin Luther King’s distinction between hope and optimism: the former is based on some paths in principle being open; the latter is an estimate of probabilities. You can hold on to hope, even as your thoughts turn pessimistic.So, what is, in principle, possible? Resistance is, among other things, a collective action problem. It is dispiriting that some prominent figures and organizations – Bezos being an obvious example – sent a signal of capitulation before Trump 2.0 even started. But others are not capitulating and instead connecting with others. There are now many federal workers who have been senselessly, often cruelly, laid off; they appear to be getting organized, and they can rely on the fact that much of the sabotage Trump and Musk are engaged in is unpopular. Of course, some audiences will stick with the cliche of the lazy bureaucrat, but others witnessing these scenes are realizing, perhaps more than ever, that there are people genuinely dedicated to public service (many veterans among them).Jan-Werner Mülleris a professor of politics at Princeton University and is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsTrump administrationElon MuskDemocratsChuck SchumerRepublicanscommentShareReuse this content"

Email us atchangebydegrees@theguardian.comSupported byAbout this contentJames NormanFri 21 Feb 2025 18.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 19.18 ESTShareBatteries are becoming an increasingly ubiquitous piece of Australia’s clean energy transition – both in our homes and as part of our national power grid.About one in five new solar installations now include a home battery, an increase from one in 20 in 2021, according to fresh data provided by Jeff Sykes, CEO of comparison website Solar Choice.This has been driven by a considerableincrease in the role of big batteriesand a growing number of Australians turning to household batteries to store power generated by solar panels to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.For those wishing to take advantage of batteries, the good news is the price and ease of installation are making them increasingly accessible to home owners.The benefits of batteries in urban settingsGlenn Curry, who lives in a 100-year-old weatherboard house in Boroondara in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs, installed a new battery when upgradeding his 20-year-old 5kw solar system to a new 10kw solar system.He installed the battery on the wall in a shady spot on the east side of his building alongside his solar inverters, thus avoiding the need for inconvenient run cables.Curry says one of the things he enjoys about the new battery is that it comes with a phone app that allows him to check the amount of power coming into the battery daily. “We are saving up for an EV (electric vehicle) and will then be able to charge the EV with all that extra solar power,” he says.Curry encourages people to get a battery before solar panels – that way, you can store electricity from the grid when it’s cheap and run your house off your battery when it’s more expensive.“This is easy for your installer to do and can be set up later as well.”Do you live in a region with an unreliable grid?For some people, batteries have more of a purely practical application beyond wanting to reduce their carbon footprint. People in regional areas will often have to deal with inconsistent power from the grid, so having a decent battery can be a necessity.According to Lance Turner fromRenew, a not-for-profit focused on climate and energy resilience for Australian homes, there are several factors to consider before installing a battery in a home.“It’s important to ensure that the system being installed can deliver the amount of power and energy required during outages,” he says, adding that not all batteries are capable of grid backup and some may only power critical appliances, like a refrigerator, so it is vital to ask questions.Sykes says one of the most important considerations is ensuring you have the correct amount of solar panels to support your chosen battery. “You ideally want it to be charged from surplus solar power throughout the year, including winter with lower sunlight.”New models making home installation easier and cheaperHome batteries have seen slow, incremental improvements in safety, cost reduction and ease of installation as lithium-based technology has developed, according to Finn Peacock, author of theGood Solar Guideand founder ofSolar Quoteswebsite.“The cost reduction in home batteries has been frustratingly slow, but it is starting to accelerate now,” he says.One leading improvement Peacock identifies is the move to ‘all-in-one’ modular systems where a solar inverter is included in the battery system. This is now the best option for consumers, according to Peacock, as you don’t need to buy an extra battery right away, and they can be added in later at a fraction of the cost.Big batteries vital for Australia’s renewable energy transitionAustralia was the first country to roll out big battery technology at the Hornsdale Power reserve in South Australia, whichbegan operating its 100MW Tesla batteryin November 2017 to stabilise the energy grid and avoid blackouts.Since then, progress has slowed, but Victoriarecently announceda new $370m 100MW battery to accompany a solar farm in the state’s west. While big batteries have seen greater advancement and emergence in recent years, Sykes says that is largely because they operate on a more attractive revenue model to a home battery as they are connected to the wholesale market.“In order for Australia to move to 100% renewables, adequate energy storage is required,” says Peacock. “While traditionally this has been done using pumped hydro systems, large scale batteries have rapidly become the system of choice for energy companies due to their rapid deployability, flexibility and rapid response times, as well as the steadily declining costs.”Share your tipsTell us hereYour responses, which can be anonymous, are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions.

He’s the patsy: giving everything away, getting little in returnFri 21 Feb 2025 10.21 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 12.16 ESTShareHe parades as a strongman, but in fact he’s weak, weak, weak. In the face of America’s adversariesDonald Trumpis, as he might put it, a patsy, a sucker, a pushover. He folds like a pack of cards. He’s a human doormat. A loser.Just consider the gifts he has handed Vladimir Putin this week. He has brought Russia in from the diplomatic cold after three years of ostracism following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, whose anniversary is nearly upon us. Sergei Lavrov, Putin’s foreign minister, was meant to be persona non grata; heremains under international sanctions. Nevertheless, this week in Riyadh he met Trump’s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, inso-called peace talks.The mere fact of that meeting gave Putin something he has long desired: parity with the US. It signalled that Washington regards Moscow as its equal: not a pariah state that has committed an unconscionable act of aggression, but a fellow great power, even superpower, to be treated with respect. Whatever was agreed in Saudi Arabia, Putin will chalk that up as a win.But Trump’s generosity did not end there. For who was not in the room in Riyadh? Answer:the Ukrainians. Remember, these were talks to discuss the future of Ukraine. To end a war in Ukraine. After the invasion of Ukraine. The exclusion of Ukrainians from discussions to determine their own future is obviously an enormous concession to Putin: it ensures he ends the war on his terms. But it’s a gift of a deeper kind too. It implicitly endorses Putin’s claim that Ukraine is not a real country, that it was only ever a province of the great Russian motherland with no sovereignty of its own.There were others shut out in Saudi Arabia, and their exclusion was another kindness to the Russian dictator. The nations of Europe were not represented, even though they have a direct stake in what happens on their eastern frontier. They have been allies of Kyiv, aiding in the defence ofUkraine, and therefore their presence was deemed too uncongenial to the Russians. So they were not invited.Again, though, this concession contained another, larger one. For what is one of the great strategic goals of Putin, which explains so much of his activity over recent years, including his meddling in foreign elections? It is the fragmenting of the western alliance. He loved Brexit,cheers on the far right in Europeand backed Trump because he wants to see the crumbling of the western bloc that has stood firm against him. For a US president to follow that script, icing out America’s most longstanding allies, is a huge win for the Kremlin.Not least because it came straight after the US vice-president, JD Vance, had travelled to Munich – a city whose name will for ever be associated with the appeasement of dictators – to berate the democracies of Europe,lecturing them on free speechand culture wars, while making no mention of Russia’s suppression of all dissent, manifested in the unfortunate tendency of Putin’s internal critics to end up dead.All of this would have represented a spectacular set of concessions to Moscow. But there was more. For one thing, Trump’s comically unqualified defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, had earlierwarned Ukrainethat it would never recover the lands stolen from it by Russia and that it should abandon all dreams of joining Nato. Again, two more items on Putin’s wishlist ticked off.But then, Trump posteda social media rantthat echoed a raft of Putin’s favourite talking points. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is “A Dictator without Elections,” Trump wrote, massively unpopular with his own people, ripping off the west as Ukraine corruptly swallows up billions of dollars. To cap it all, he endorsed the Orwellian, black-is-white inversion of truth advanced by the Kremlin when he said:“You should have never started it.”As if it were Ukraine that invaded Russia three years ago, rather than the other way around.That, then, is everything Trump handed to Putin in the last week or so. And what has he got in return? Nothing, save flattery and the dangled promise oflucrative energy dealswith Moscow. Indeed, he did not so much as ask for anything in return. The supposed strongman fell to his knees and kissed the Russian dictator’s feet before they had even entered the negotiating chamber. Small wonder that Kurt Volker, who resigned as Trump’s point man on Ukraine in 2019, told me for thelatest Politics Weekly America podcastthat the president has a “blind spot on Putin,” one Volker admits he does not understand.What are we to make of Trump’s Ukraine policy? | Matt DussRead moreAll of which makes it laughable for Trump to claim he is “successfully negotiating an end to the war”, something only he could do, or for his cheerleaders to hail“the art of the peace deal”, or indeed for the meeting in Riyadh to be described as “peace talks” at all. They are nothing of the kind. If you give one side everything they want, which they naturally accept, while denying the other side everything they need, which they naturally reject, that is not a peace agreement: it is nothing more than a coerced surrender. Anybody could do that. It is no achievement at all.And Trump has form in this area, the supposed master of the deal repeatedly giving away everything and getting nothing in return. Recall hisphoto-op meetingwith Kim Jong-un in 2018. The North Korean tyrant and ruler of a slave state was rewarded with the legitimacy of a summit with – and the effusive praise of – a US president. Kim also won asuspension of US military exercisesin the Korean peninsula. These were concrete, high-value gains. In return, Kim conceded nothing but some vague aspirations for a world without nuclear weapons. He played Trump like a slot machine.To be clear, presidential weakness is not the gravest sin here. More serious is the capitulation to a dictator, the acquiescence in an invasion and the lasting precedent it sets, the abandonment of an ally fighting for its life and an apparent decision to break apart an alliance that has delivered relative peace and prosperity to the west, including the US, for eight decades.Trump’s explainers say he’s doing thisfor a hard-headed reason: to end the distraction of a war that does not affect the US directly, so that it can focus its resources on the real threat, China. But even judged on its own terms, this move is a failure. Because a broken west makes a future dominated by China more, not less, likely.The rest of the west, including Britain, needs to decide very quickly how to navigate the new world that emerged with vivid clarity this week. The postwar era is over. The global architecture built in 1945 is being burned to the ground by Trump. Europeans need to plan for, and invest in, a future where they have to defend themselves without the US. That future does not loom in the distance. It is already here.For now, there is a political job that can be done. It is the puncturing of the image Trump has done so much to cultivate, and which he relies on to intimidate others, at home and abroad. The Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal made a good start this week, when he said:“The president’s surrender is pathetic and weak.”This is the right language to use. Trump may be the greatest showman, but he is the weakest strongman the world has ever seen.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A quick Google search reveals multiple eulogies for the political and economic doctrine. But what was (or is) neoliberalism and why is it no longer with us? More importantly, why haven’t Australia’s leaders got the message?Like any term with negative connotations, “neoliberalism” is widely applied, and misapplied, and can refer to any aspect of modern capitalism that the speaker wants to criticise, fromarchitecturetoZumba. Even Donald Trump, who has repudiated the core doctrines of neoliberalism in favour of an extreme version of crony capitalism, has been described as embodying the“ultimate triumph of neoliberalism”.The core meaning refers to a set of economic policies that emerged in the 1970s as a response to the economic crises of the time, seen as representing the failure of the Keynesian and social democratic welfare state. The central element of these policies was the elevation of markets, and particularly financial markets, as superior to democratic governments.The Invisible Doctrine by George Monbiot and Peter Hutchison review – neoliberalism’s ascentRead moreThe most important exponent of neoliberalism was Margaret Thatcher. Her government pioneered the main elements of the doctrine: privatisation of government enterprises, financial deregulation, the contracting out of the public sector and removing progressivity in the tax system. Above all, neoliberalism celebrated a globalised economy built on free movement of goods, capital and (in the most logically consistent versions) people.As the name implies, neoliberalism was a descendant of classical liberalism, defined by the fact that it is a reaction against social democracy, which also draws heavily on the liberal tradition. However, neoliberalism placed more weight on economic freedom than on personal freedom or civil liberties, reversing the emphasis of classical liberals like John Stuart Mill. On matters of personal freedom, neoliberalism was basically agnostic, encompassing a range of views from repressive traditionalism to libertarianism.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIn terms of economic policy, neoliberalism was constrained by the need to compete with the achievements of social democracy. Hence, it is inconsistent with the kind of dogmatic libertarianism that would leave the poor to starvation or private charity, and would leave education to parents. Neoliberalism sought to cut back the role of the state as much as possible while maintaining a basic safety net and access to health and education services.Much of the political left, including the Hawke and Keating governments in Australia, responded by adopting a “soft” form of neoliberalism, referred to at the time as the Third Way. Soft neoliberals accepted the supremacy of financial markets and the need to roll back state intervention, but sought to protect as much as possible of the welfare state built up in the era of social democracy.From the late 1970s to the end of the 20th century, neoliberalism appeared both successful and unstoppable. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 not only removed the only serious competitor to capitalism, but appeared to discredit the social democrat alternative to unrestrained reliance on markets. Booming stock markets seemed to validate Thatcher’s idea of a “shareholder democracy”. Bond markets pronounced infallible judgments on governments that deviated from the neoliberal orthodoxy encapsulated in what was called the “Washington Consensus”, reflecting the views of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and US Treasury. With his characteristic gift for glib metaphor, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman referred to the “golden straitjacket”, that is, the proposition that strict adherence to neoliberal rules would be rewarded with endless prosperity.But the 21st century began with the spectacular implosion of the “dotcom” tech stock bubble, which required a massive bailout from the US Federal Reserve. Much worse was to come with the global financial crisis and the decade of austerity that followed in the US and Europe. The only people who prospered through the years of austerity were the bankers and financiers who had caused the crisis in the first place.The GFC destroyed the neoliberal faith in markets, and particularly in financial markets. But, as is common with financial crises, the immediate response was not a shift to the political left. Rather, an older version of rightwing politics re-emerged, epitomised by the election of Donald Trump as US president. Trumpism rejects the idea of markets built on mutual beneficial transactions, and sees trade as a zero-sum game.Throughout the ascendancy of neoliberalism, rightwing parties relied on more or less coded appeals to racism and nativism to secure the votes of their base, while assuring their corporate backers that the business of globalisation would carry on as usual. With Trump’s rise to power, the tables have been turned. Trump has upended world trade with tariffs, and intervened in the domestic economy to reward loyalists and punish enemies. Corporate oligarchs now have to beg and bribe their way into his favour.The same is true, in a less dramatic way, in Australia. The Coalition no longer speaks the language of free-market reform. Peter Dutton is promising to introduce divestiture powers to our competition laws to break up the monopolies and near-monopolies that dominate theAustralian economy. Less admirably, but even more in conflict with the dictates of neoliberalsim, we have a commitment to a government-owned nuclear power industry, tax breaks for business lunches and restrictions on migration.Trumpism, whether full-strength or in the watered-down form seen in Australia, is not an answer to the failure of neoliberalism. But until centre-left parties can escape the mental prison built by decades of soft neoliberalism, it is what we are likely to get.John Quiggin is a professor at the University of Queensland’s school of economicsExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionEconomicsAustralian economycommentShareReuse this content"

The agreement also paved the way to end years of political deadlock in Beirut. Lebanon has formed anew government, and finally has leaders chosen for their promises to carry out reforms, rather than their sectarian affiliations – but the future of the ceasefire deal has left them facing an immediate crisis.The original 60-day ceasefire was intended to give the two sides time to negotiate a longer truce. Under the deal, Israeli was supposed to fully withdraw its troops from parts of southern Lebanon it had invaded in October, whileHezbollahagreed to move its fighters and weapons north of the Litani river, about 16 miles (25 km) from the Israel-Lebanon border. The Israeli and Hezbollah withdrawals would allow the Lebanese army to move into southern Lebanon.As the deadline for Israel to pull out its forces neared, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government said itwould not complywith a full withdrawal and the ceasefire was extended for three weeks until 18 February. That extension has now expired, and while Israel withdrew from a number of Lebanese towns and villages, it is keeping troopsin five strategic locationsacross southern Lebanon that provide vantage points or are located across from communities in northern Israel. While Israeli officials are calling it a “temporary” deployment of troops inside Lebanon, it’s an occupation of Lebanese territory and it could lead to the ceasefire’s collapse.In a speech on Sunday, Hezbollah’s leader, Naim Qassem, warned thatIsrael must completely withdrawits forces by the 18 February deadline. While he stopped short of promising to renew Hezbollah’s attacks, he cautioned: “Everyone knows how an occupation is dealt with.” In fact, Hezbollah was founded in the 1980s – with the help of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards – to fight the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, which followed Israel’s 1982 invasion that was intended to expel the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) from Lebanon. While Israel succeeded in driving out the PLO and other Palestinian factions, the subsequent occupation gave birth to one of Israel’s most formidable enemies: Hezbollah, which fought an 18-year guerilla war that eventually forced Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon in 2000.Hezbollah has been severely weakened by its most recent war with Israel,which assassinated most of the group’s top leadersand destroyed a significant portion of its estimatedarsenal of more than100,000 missiles and rockets. But, as it has done in the past, Israel risks overreaching after its initial victory on the battlefield, especially as the US failed to restrain Netanyahu from prolonging Israel’s war in Gaza and expanding it into Lebanon. Netanyahu’s government has convinced Donald Trump and his administration to allow Israel to keep a “long term” military presence in southern Lebanon, according toIsraeli press reports.If Israel continues to occupy parts ofLebanon, with Trump’s blessing, it would not only risk renewed conflict with Hezbollah, but also deal a death blow to Lebanon’s new leadership.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump at a press conference at the White House on 4 February.Photograph: Alex Brandon/APThe new president, Joseph Aoun, and prime minister, Nawaf Salam, have pledged to prioritise economic reforms, manage reconstruction after the devastating war with Israel and deploy the Lebanese army in areas that had been controlled by Hezbollah. But they will lose most of their momentum to implement reforms unless Israel withdraws its remaining troops from Lebanon and the two countries can negotiate a more permanent truce.A prolonged Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory – even if Israel tries to portray it as a defensive move intended to protect Israeli communities across the border – would cripple Lebanon’s new leaders before they’ve had a chance to tackle the country’s deep economic and social problems, which long predate the recent war.The latest Israel-Hezbollah conflict started a day after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel. The militia’s leaders said it was an effort to support their Palestinian allies and divert Israeli military resources from Gaza. For 11 months, the daily exchange of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border fluctuated, as Hezbollah tried to avoid a wider war it feared losing. By September, Israel dramatically escalated the conflict when it detonatedthousands of pagers and walkie-talkiesused by Hezbollah members, killing dozens and wounding more than 3,000 people. Israel then assassinated the group’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in a massive airstrike on a building complex in Beirut’s southern suburbs.By December, Israeli attacks over 14 months had killedmore than 4,000 peopleand displaced more than 1 million, nearly a quarter of Lebanon’s population. The World Bank estimated that the conflict caused $8.5bn ineconomic losses to Lebanon, including nearly 100,000 housing units that were damaged or fully destroyed.Even before the recent war, Lebanon was suffering from an economic crisis precipitated by the country’s dysfunctional political structure and its corrupt former warlords who took control of the state in the early 1990s at the end of a 15-year civil war. The economic collapse began in the fall of 2019, when banks ran out of dollars to pay their depositors and the Lebanese currency eventually lost more than 98% of its value.The World Bank labelledit as one of the most severe economic collapses worldwide since the mid-19th century.As a majority of Lebanese peoplestruggled to secure food, medicine, fuel and other necessities, the country’s sectarian leaders continued to bicker over control of various ministries and were unable to elect a president or form a cabinet for years. But the political class was finally able to break the deadlock after the ceasefire and Hezbollah’s weakening.The task of rebuilding the economy – and swaths of Lebanon newly devastated by war with Israel – falls to a new Lebanese government that must maintain a perilous truce and keep a powerful neighbour at bay.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor at New York UniversityDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So why isn’t Labour shouting about it?Polly SmytheWhy would the government water down and downplay such a popular policy? Because the business lobby doesn’t like itFri 21 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 12.25 ESTShareAt last year’s TUC conference, the employment rights minister, Justin Madders, described Labour’s workers’ rights package as “the sort of thing that would make you say to the person on the street: ‘It does matter who you vote for.’” Despite the bill’s initial offering havingbeen diluted, he is right: day one employment rights, an end to “exploitative” zero-hours contracts and a clampdown on fire-and-rehire.In the midst of abysmal polling, you would thinkLabour, desperate to prove that after more than a decade of Tory dysfunction the government can improve people’s daily lives, would loudly embrace its overhaul of worker protections. But that is not what has happened. Instead, even as the government has launched a frenzied publicity offensive over its “tough” immigration stance, it has remained comparably silent over its employment reforms, seeming to shyaway from letting news of the bill even reach the person on the street.What is going on? The answer is simple: fevered controversy surrounding Labour’s modest employment reform has the government running scared. Spearheading the alarmism is thebusiness lobby– in a reprisal of its hysteria prior to the introduction of the minimum wage – which is prophesyingjob lossesandcompany closuresas a result of reform. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has been open about“lobbying hard”against the bill. The group’s chair, Rupert Soames, has accused Labour of treating business like a“cash cow”, and insisted that the combination of the new reforms with a raise in the national minimum wage and employers’ national insurance contributions will prompt an“ugly rush”of sackings.Parts of the media have been more than happy to amplify these scare stories. AFinancial Times editorialtitled “Labour needs to compromise on employment rights” claimed that, if the party is to “foster the economic dynamism the UK needs”, it will need to go “much further in adjusting the legislation to meet business concerns.”.Reform UK has voted against the employment rights bill at every stage, with Nigel Farage using hisGB News slotto allege that protecting workers from third-party harassment spelled the end for pub banter.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has also taken aim at the legislation, accusing Keir Starmer of proposing not an employment bill but an “unemployment bill” that would leave the public with “higher prices, fewer jobs and less growth”.That the attacks on the bill, and on Labour’s links with the unions, are so predictable is what makes the government’s vulnerability to them so disappointing. Trade unions – who have fought line by line over the reforms with Labour for years – know full well that the government’s reticence to champion the bill puts it at greater risk of being further derailed.Not one to flinch from a challenge, Mick Lynch, when asked about the CBI’s defence of fire-and-rehire, told theemployment rights committeethere is no doubt that the Factories Act – a Victorian law restricting children labour – was “a bit burdensome for the mill owners and mining companies of this country”.With the bill under siege, robust ripostes like these are needed to protect it. Before it had even reached parliament, key provisions had been walked back. Gone are universal plans for “fair pay agreements”, which would have imposed sectoral collective bargaining across the economy, but will now only be used in the adult social care sector. Also scrapped is the pledge to pay in full the wages of workers on zero-hours contracts who have their shifts cancelled “without appropriate notice”, replaced instead by “compensation that is proportionate”.And with Labour having left much of the hard work of fleshing out the bill to future secondary legislation and consultations, there is growing anxiety among unions over the potential for even further backsliding. Take the question of employment status. With entitlement to many of the new rights unveiled by Labour hinging on the question of worker classification, clarification on the boundary between employment and self-employment is urgently needed to ensure the maximum number of workers benefit.Yet despite an initial commitment to move “towards a single status of worker and transition towards a simpler two-part framework for employment status”, this policy will instead be subject to a “full and detailed consultation”. After years of debate and two backbench bills on the subject, it is hard to know what could be left to consult on. “You can probably consult till the cows come home,”said Margaret Beels, the government’s independent director of labour market enforcement. “It’s about time to do something about it.”Starmer’s aides will not be able to fix his problems. He has to do that himself | Tom BaldwinRead moreWith the employment bill expected to make its way back to the Commons soon, unions are working hard to ensure that the promises Labour made them in opposition are the policies it delivers while in government. Last week, the 11 general secretaries of trade unions affiliated to Labour, including Unite and GMB, called on the government in anopen letterto “stand firm on workers’ rights” and “face down the naysayers”.With Labour so fixated on establishing its economic credibility in the eyes of the corporate world, it has fallen to the TUC to make the point that the new workers’ rights bill supports, and not hinders, the government’s growth strategy. Rather than cede to Reform on immigration, Labour is being pushed by the TUC to use its expansion in workers’ rights as ammunition in the fight against the party,publishing a pollshowing the popularity of the bill among Reform voters.Taking the results of this pollto the streets, the TUC asked Clacton residents who they thought had opposed the employment rights bill. They shot back with “businesspeople, obviously”, “the employer” and “company owners”. When told that it was in fact their MP, Nigel Farage, they reacted with genuine shock. “Nigel? No!” replied one woman. “I am really surprised. Because I thought he was working for the public.”Labour should take this as proof that failing to talk about workers’ rights is not only morally weak, but a strategic miscalculation. Remaining silent on a policy that makes workers’ lives more stable and dignified leaves space for Reform to step in and present itself as the party providing solutions for working people. If Labour caves in further to corporate scaremongering, it will be more than just its relationship with the unions that is at stake.Polly Smythe is labour movement correspondent at Novara MediaExplore more on these topicsWorkers' rightsOpinionLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Just days ago, an escalating dispute threatened the deal after both sides expressed frustration about the other’s fulfilment of their respective obligations. Donald Trump’s recent proposal toresettle Gaza’s populationof two million Palestinians also rattled the truce.The turbulences of the month-old ceasefire expose a deeper political uncertainty: after 15 months of fighting, no clear vision exists for what comes next. Who should govern and rebuild Gaza? What will its future relationship withIsraelbe?To navigate these questions, listening to ordinary people’s perspectives is crucial. As behavioural scientists based at the London School of Economics, Jeremy Ginges and I conducted a large-scale study of how Palestinians in Gaza and Israelis view each other, and the future. Just days before the ceasefire was announced in January, we surveyed more than 1,400 people in nationally representative samples. Ongoing access restrictions and the conflict mean that public opinion in Gaza is rarely discussed. Our data collection there was part of in-person interviews led byArtis Internationaland thePalestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research(PSR) with its existing polling infrastructure. Additionally, we spoke to several Palestinians in Gaza during the ceasefire’s first phase via online phone calls several weeks ago.One of the most striking findings in our research is how a deep psychological asymmetry between each side’s perceptions of the conflict has entrenched divisions. In Gaza, despite 16 months of devastating conflict and displacement – in the cases of some of those we polled as many as 10 times – political convictions were prioritised by many Palestinians, even over immediate personal safety. Respondents were asked to indicate how much they considered different values as part of their personal identity. Israelis hold more firmly now to their national identity compared to data we collected in May 2024, and a large majority of people in Gaza now indicate strong commitment to being Palestinian (94%), achieving national sovereignty (86%), and the right of refugees to return to their ancestral towns and villages lost during Israel’s creation in 1948 (90%). A smaller group, but still more than a quarter, even saw these values as completely central to their identity, a predictor of extreme sacrifice and violence,as Scott Atran and Ángel Gómez write. About one in four people in Gaza fully identified with maximalist ideas of sharia law and hard opposition to peace with Israel. As fewer Palestinians in Gaza consider the war the most pressing challenge for Palestinians, a trend shown bya recent PSR poll, other political identities are coming back to the fore.To better understand the current perspective of Palestinians inGaza, we examined their interpretation of the conflict so far. We asked why members of their own group supported violence during the war and why they believed the other side did. A striking pattern emerged: both Israelis and Palestinians attributed their own side’s attacks to “ingroup love” (concern and protection for their people) more than to “outgroup hate” (a desire to harm the other side). However, both groups believed that the other side was motivated more by hatred.This perception gap matters. Research shows that when people believe they are hated by another group, they become less inclined to support diplomatic solutions. Our data confirms this. When it comes to long-term political futures in Gaza, slightly less than half (48%) of Palestinians remain supportive of some form of a two-state solution. Others said the more realistic scenarios for ending the conflict involve the displacement of Jews from the region (20%), or the establishment of one state under strict sharia law (27%), in which Jews would have fewer rights. Only 5% believed in a one-state solution with coexistence under equal rights.But how – and with whom as leaders – do people in Gaza envision achieving their goals?Hamas, which has ruled the territory since 2007 and is rooted in the idea of an Islamic Palestinian nation, may seem the natural contender. But according to PSR polls, support for Hamas has decreased from 42%shortly after 7 October 2023to only 21% in January 2025. In fact, as Hamas’s wartime performance is increasingly criticised,fewer people in Gazasee it winning or support attacks against Israel. Together with many Palestinians preferring more reconciliatory visions in the first place, this is good news for peace efforts.Fewer Palestinians in Gaza trust Hamas to represent their interests - graphAnd yet, if elections were held, many Palestinians say they would still vote for Hamas. The reason? No viable alternative has seized on Hamas’s decline. Fatah, the ruling party in the West Bank and dominant force in the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), is widely considered weak and illegitimate, as people in our research confirmed. Once again, perceptions of outgroup hate significantly lowered approval of the PLO, which stands for a more diplomatic approach towards Israel. Other political figures have gained popularity, but no movement has coalesced around them. Instead, the 32% of Palestinians who say their interests are entirely unrepresented by all available options now form the largest constituency in Gaza.With no clear leadership, Gaza’s post-war future remains undecided. There is reason to hope, however. For one, more than 90% of the people in Gaza are optimistic about long-term prospects for an armistice or peace. Perceptions about outgroup hate can change over time, as our data indicates, or be corrected, according toexperimental studies. Although difficult, this could boost support for diplomacy and reconciliation. As for concrete policies, the people we polled in Gaza are increasingly open to some alternatives, such as a temporary security presence and reconstructionfacilitated by Egypt.After nearly sliding back into war, Israel and Hamas now enter a fragile new round of ceasefire negotiations. But the real challenge is finding leaders on both sides who can not only represent their people’s political interests, but also bridge the psychological divide that obstructs lasting peace.Nils Mallock is research fellow at the XCEPT research group at King’s College London, a PhD candidate at the London School of Economics, and regularly briefs the UK Foreign Office on policy-related issuesThis article was co-authored by Jeremy Ginges, professor in behavioural science at the London School of Economics and author of various studies on intergroup conflict and conflict resolutionDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

With Reform targeting Labour’s working-class support, a reappraisal is overdueFri 21 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 07.26 ESTShareAs one poll this month placed Nigel Farage’sReform UK aheadof Labour and the Conservatives for the first time, I sought distraction on holiday in Jonathan Coe’s latest novel. Set during the brief seven-week premiership of Liz Truss,The Proof of My Innocenceis a Graham Greene-style “entertainment”, rather than another Coe state-of-the-nation book like Middle England or Bournville. But it does deal with a serious political theme: the morphing of British conservatism, from the 1980s onwards, into the radical, insurgent force that culminated in Brexit, Boris Johnson and Kwasi Kwarteng’s budget.Coe writes wonderfully well, and with empathy about very different social worlds. But his overall perspective generally stays within an embattled liberal-left comfort zone. Towards the end of the book, a twentysomething character offers her take on the disruptions that led to our present discontent: “Britain changed. What we had before: consensus more or less. What came after: libertarianism/individualism. Every man and woman for his/herself.” Earlier, the revelation of a secret plot to sell the NHS out to big pharma – involving a high-profile Brexiter – underlines a gradual eclipse of public virtue by private monied interests.Malign and greedy motives cloaked in false patriotism, driving an elite that is bent on misinforming and hoodwinking the less well off and the less well educated. This is one standard progressive explanation for how Britain went off the rails. And as I turned the final pages of The Proof of My Innocence, politics was imitating art in the House of Commons.At a recent prime minister’s questions, Keir Starmer used a planted backbench question tosound the alarmover Reform’s plans to sell out the NHS. Farage’s sympathy for insurance-based healthcare, Labour research suggests, is viewed with deep suspicion in the kinds of seats that Reform hopes to win en masse in 2029. There will be much more of the same before May’s council elections, as Starmer seeks to detach blue-collar voters from a movement that is visibly reassembling the Get Brexit Done coalition of 2019.Fair enough. “When in doubt, campaign on the NHS” is an unwritten law on the British centre-left. Obeying it is an understandable manoeuvre from a government increasingly traumatised by Farage’s rise. But as the wind from the radical right blows ever harder through western democracies, the politics of the moment require more than defensive pieties, buttressed with technocratic talk about policy “delivery”.All over again, Labour is losing its working-class audience. Among non-graduates andyoung men, among the inhabitants of unlevelled-up towns, and among those nostalgic for a lost sense of community cohesion, Farage is making hay. As talk of anelectoral pactbetween Reform and the Conservatives begins on the right, the remain/leave divide in British politics is back.It never really went away – although Covid and its scandals scuppered Johnson’s attempt to seize the moment for the right. A post-industrial cleavage both cultural and economic was never just about the case for and against leaving the European Union. At its most basic, the blue-collar leave vote expressed a desire for rupture with a globalised capitalism that had undermined the power and agency of the western working class. It also reflected a latent perception that compassionate “one world” social liberalism coexisted happily with a callous economic version; one that had stripped people and places of dignity, status and self-esteem.So what now? Following the post-pandemic Tory implosion, the last election represented a historic opportunity for a radical social-democratic response to an ongoing crisis of trust. But whether through naivety, timidity or a hapless lack of curiosity regarding the social class it was founded to represent,Labourtook its handsome victory as evidence of a national desire that normal “grownup” service should resume. Predictably, after six arid months amid plunging poll ratings, it is now planning tougher Reform-style rhetoric on immigration, in the hope of shoring up its position among the Farage-facing.The heart sinks at the lack of ambition and insight. But there is still time to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past in the lead up to 2029. It is, for example, heartening to learn that the much maligned, much misunderstood Blue Labour movement is nowgetting a hearingin Downing Street. Afledgling caucusof sympathetic MPs has also formed in parliament, interestingly including a number from the former Corbynite left.Founded in 2009 by the iconoclastic peer Maurice Glasman, Blue Labour made brief waves as a proto “left-conservative” grouping, focused on protecting blue-collar communities from the depredations of free-market capitalism. It then sank beneath those waves – in a tide of opprobrium – when it emerged that such protections would include restrictions on the import of cheaper migrant labour.Starmer’s dislike of real politics is plain to see. It’s why his government has no direction | John HarrisRead moreSupport for Brexit, and a communitarian emphasis on “family, faith and flag”, further scandalised secular liberal progressives. Glasman and other leading figures were anathematised. Jonathan Rutherford, a former speechwriter for the ex-Labour MP Jon Cruddas, made a list of the insults that came their way. “Weirdos, misogynists, authoritarians, Brexit, thick leave voters, ageing left-behind men, not welcome, fuck off and join the Tories” were at the politer end of the spectrum.Yet in its analysis of the dynamics of western democracies in the early 21st century, Blue Labour got a remarkable amount right. On immigration, the issue that supposedly rendered it beyond the pale, its views will never mesh with those of Labour’s liberal left, but areno longer outlying. The crucial point is that they were always contained within a wider critique of contemporary capitalism, and the contemporary left, that will be key to challenging a Faragian right.Over the past quarter-century, progressive parties became more middle class, more city based and focused more on individual rights than social class. As Blue Labour has argued, they failed to seriously challenge the economic and social consequences of a world constructed to suit the restless, indifferent, profit-seeking interests of financial capital. The result has been a growing division of people and, just as significantly, places into winners and losers – adeepening dividethat individualist rhetoric about equality of opportunity will not bridge.Phyl, Coe’s youthful protagonist in The Proof of My Innocence, was right. Thatcherism did deliver, and morally justify, a selfish “me first” world. But Faragism, as it prosecutes an exclusionary politics of identity and belonging, is as much a response to that legacy as a continuation of it. Faced with a form of rightwing communitarianism that is shaping a dark future, Blue Labour thinking can be part of a successful response.

Today, leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates will gather in Riyadh to discuss Donald Trump’s proposal for a US takeover of Gaza. (Keen to be viewed as a global deal maker,Saudi Arabiawill also be hosting negotiations over Ukraine this week.)Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was alarmed by Trump’s outrageous “Riviera plan” to reconstruct Gaza following eviction of its people to neighbouring countries. Alongside Arab leaders, he hopes to proposean alternative planwith the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem its capital at its core. The crown prince has insisted that there will be no normalisation of Israel without a Palestinian state.In the short term, he may succeed in preventing theeviction of Palestinians from Gazaand their proposed resettlement in Egypt, Jordan, and even Saudi Arabia. The summit promises to raise enough funds for reconstruction while leaving Palestinians in temporary shelters on their own land.The urgent and more challenging item of the summit’s agenda will be finding an alternative power to replace Hamas as the government of Gaza. Prince Mohammed is a sworn enemy of several Islamist movements, but his disdain for Hamas is more profound. He considers it responsible for derailing his plan to complete normalisation withIsraelafter 7 October 2023.The crown prince’s determination to normalise relations with Israel springs out of domestic interest. Saudi Arabia would like to see the transfer of Israeli technology, military equipment, intelligence and develop closer trade relations. More importantly, he hopes such a move would lead to closer security ties with the United States.In the long term, Prince Mohammed is unlikely to be successful for two reasons. First,Israel will prove a major obstacle, given that Benjamin Netanyahu unequivocally refuses to accept Palestinian statehood and sovereignty.Second, an alternative plan that completely sidelines Hamas has very little chance of succeeding. The political organisation may give up governance inGazain return for reconstruction, but it will not simply vanish. Unlike in 1982, when the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) under Yasser Arafat was pushed out of Lebanon to Tunisia after the Israeli occupation of the south of the country, Hamas is fighting on its own land. The subsequent Lebanese Christian massacre of Palestinian refugees in Sabra and Shatila after the departure of the PLO is still alive in Palestinian memory. Hamas will not accept any plan that will bring about an end to Palestine as it is imagined by several generations of Palestinian exiles around the world and the people of Gaza who endured more than 15 months of slaughter.Trump’s plan for Gaza leaves Arab nations facing an impossible choice | Nesrine MalikRead moreThe Saudi alternative plan is driven by pure self-interest, namely, to mitigate against the destabilisation of several Arab regimes, itself included.Forced eviction of Palestinianswill inevitably spread Hamas, its fighters and political Islam – mainly the Muslim Brotherhood – into countries that have been deliberately and successfully suppressing such ideology. None of the Arab regimes want to see Hamas fighters and their extended communities living in their countries.The Muslim Brotherhood ideology invokes governance according to Islam, but at the same time talks about democracy. It is a global movement that appeals to many young Muslims, including Saudis, aspiring toward some kind of Islamic democratic rule, according to their own interpretation of both Islam and democracy. As such it immediately threatens monarchical rule.Prince Mohammed has focused on economic and social liberalisation, both of which included suppressing the Muslim Brotherhood variant of Islamism. Any attempt to evict Palestinian Hamas will definitely revive political Islam.Moreover, should Palestinians be forced to leave their territory en masse, Prince Mohammed fears the reaction of the Saudi public and being portrayed as the Arab monarch who “sold Palestine”. Saudi citizens have more solidarity with Palestinians than their regime as the latter had been indoctrinating them to be leaders among Arabs and Muslims when it suited the monarchy’s interest. Prince Mohammed has since pivoted to adopting slogans such as “Saudi Arabia for Saudis” and “Make Saudi Arabia Great”, echoing Trump and hoping to divorce Saudis from regional and global Muslim causes. However, Saudis have already internalised their religious duty to side with Arabs and Muslims. So far, Prince Mohammed has pushed to repress solidarity by jailing those who openly support or call for demonstrations on behalf of Palestinians.It is still unclear what the governance of Gaza will look like. Despite the destruction, neither Prince Mohammed nor other Arab countries can successfully decide the fate of Gaza without engagement with the Palestinians themselves. While many Arab countries have already signed normalisation agreements with Israel, none have brought peace. In fact, the opposite has happened, for a simple reason. Palestinians themselves were sidelined. Only an agreement between Israel and Palestinians that guarantees Palestinian statehood and sovereignty will bring about a long-lasting peace. The “Saudi awakening” will pass without creating the conditions for this peace if all Palestinian factions, including Hamas, are not sitting at the negotiation table.Madawi al-Rasheed is a fellow of the British Academy and a visiting professor at the Middle East Centre, London School of Economics.

Rightwing politicians around the world want women to have more babies, and if you find this idea the opposite of romantic – well, me too.Pronatalism’s cause is not exactly helped by having as its best-known figureheads JD“childless cat lady”Vance and Elon Musk, seemingly on a personal mission to reverse what he calls the “underpopulation crisis”. Even Nigel Farage, a twice-divorced father of four who takes the firmly libertarian view that private lives are no business of the state, squirmed whentackled on the subjectthis week, before eventually venturing that the west had “kind of forgotten that what underpins everything is our Judeo-Christian culture” and that “of course, we need higher birthrates, but we’re not going to get higher birthrates in this country until we can get some sense of optimism”. But do progressives, who are after all supposed to be in the optimism business, have a stake in the baby-making debate too? A new collection of essays published this week by the cross-party Social Market Foundation (SMF) thinktankargues that they should.The children of Britain’s last baby boom, my own son among them, are now pretty much grown up. Though it didn’t always feel that way at the time, as their parents we had it relatively easy: the 00s were in retrospect the golden years of a Labour government seeking to lift families out of poverty, extend maternity leave and take work-life balance seriously. It wasn’t men preaching traditional values, but working mothers in parliament determined to make life easier for others coming up behind them that unexpectedly helped send thebirthrate in England and Wales shooting upfrom an average of 1.64 children for every woman in 2001 to 1.97 at its pre-recession, 2008 peak.But by 2023 it had plummeted to 1.44, and the SMF calculates it will be under 1.4 by the mid-2030s. Though some of that fall involves people happily choosing to be child-free, that seems unlikely to be the whole story, given the SMF notes that the big fall happened during the austerity years and it was sharpest in more deprived neighbourhoods. Who could have guessed that if you offer would-be parents stagnant wages, galloping rents and some of the most expensive childcare in Europe, while limiting some child benefits to the first two children only, they end up having fewer children? Not five avowedly pro-family Conservative prime ministers in a row, apparently.View image in fullscreenElon Musk and Donald Trump in the Oval Office, 11 February 2025.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersThe problem for Labour now, as the SMF points out, is that fewer babies equals an ageing population. This means a tax base shrinking at such a rate that the rate of productivity growth would need to more than double (a challenge that has famously defeated the government’s predecessors) for us just to enjoy the same mediocre growth in living standards we have been complaining about for years. Yet there remains an instinctive “ick” factor to politicians trying to engineer more babies, inextricably associated as that has become with dangerously reactionary attitudes to women’s bodies, or efforts to reduce the need for immigration.More pragmatically, even if we could get past that, it’s far from obvious how governments actually make it happen. Hungary’s rightwing pronatalist government poured 5% of GDP into tax cuts and bribes for parents, yet birthrates are now falling again after a temporary surge. Even the Swedes and Finns, with their enviably cheap nurseries and egalitarian workplaces, are struggling. And that’s where the SMF’s essays come in.Co-editor Phoebe Arslanagić-Little, who runs the pro-parenthood campaign Boom, argues there’s nothing innately conservative about helping people live the lives they actually want, and that for most – though very much not all – that includes parenthood. More than half of British 32-year-olds already have children and half of the rest would like to, according toresearch from the UCLCentre for Longitudinal Studies, while about 12% of those without children are sure they don’t want to be parents. Yet only a quarter of those who knew they wanted either to start or add to a family were actively trying for a baby. Money worries, concerns about the impact on careers, not feeling ready and not having the right partner were the most common hurdles. Though there is little the state can do about the last two, it definitely has a role in the others.Modern dating is broken – and that’s a hidden factor in England’s fertility crisis  | Siân BoyleRead moreMany of the ideas in this book are easy ones for progressives to get behind, from tackling Britain’s woefully stingy statutory paternity leave or funding NHS fertility treatment properly, to transferring wealth from old to young. The family-friendly parts of Angela Rayner’semployment rights billmay well be pro-baby too, given flexible working keeps the show on the road for many parents. What’s unclear is whether any of this is enough to sway young couples contemplating bringing children into a world now seemingly on fire.Gen Z and their serious-minded younger siblings, gen Alpha, are already showing signs of being more socially conservative than millennials, which suggests their attitudes to parenthood may yet surprise us.According to YouGov, they are more pro-marriage, and less likely to say one-night stands are common in their peer group. There is a distinct yearning for the cosy and domestic among those who grew up in lockdown and seemingly love nothing better than staying in, snuggled up under a blanket. (Though admittedly that creates its own problems, with Finland’s demographic rapporteur Anna Rotkirch arguing in her SMF essay not just for financial help, such as student loan reductions for younger parents, but more help with social skills to help teenagers form relationships.) Watching the new Bridget Jones film in a cinema full of nostalgic mothers and teenage daughters, I thought the girls might be bored by an unashamedly middle-aged film with parenthood past, present and future unexpectedly at its heart. But something about Bridget clearly touches a gen Z chord, though her setup – splintered by widowhood but cushioned by the perfect nanny who just falls into her lap, a boss thrilled for her to resume her old career whenever she’s ready, and a huge house on the edge of Hampstead Heath – is miles from what most will experience.Still, it’s a reminder that what ultimately makes people feel ready to have children is security, economic and emotional: the intangible feeling that everything is where it should be in life, love and work, so now you can relax and settle down. Having children is the ultimate gesture of confidence in the future, but that confidence has understandably drained away over the last decade and a half in response to more brittle and precarious circumstances. Fix that, and politicians may find the baby business looks after itself.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsChildrenOpinionJD VanceElon MuskParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

More than a third (36%) of the organisations’ chief executives or other executive directors went to private schools.The analysis also found that 17.5% of artistic directors and more than a quarter (26%) of chief executives went to Oxford or Cambridge, compared with less than 1% of the general population.Andy Haldane, the chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts, said he was “shocked by that finding but not especially surprised”.Haldane, who is a former chief economist at the Bank of England, said: “As one of the most dynamic sectors of the economy, the creative industries will need to do a much better job of nurturing socioeconomic mobility to realise their potential.”The Guardian was able to find information for 76 leadership roles at 49 of the 50 organisations.Research by theSutton Trusthas highlighted a stark overrepresentation in the arts for those from the most affluent backgrounds, which it defined as “upper middle-class backgrounds”.The report found that 43% of Britain’s best-selling classical musicians and 35% of Bafta-nominated actors were alumni of private schools. Among classical musicians, 58% had attended university, as well as 64% of top actors.Researchers found a less stark divide in pop music, where only 8% of artists were educated privately and 20% university-educated, both close to the national averages.The number of UK students taking arts subjects has also plummeted in recent years, leading to what the Guardian dubbed a “creativity crisis” in state schools. Since 2010, enrolment in arts GCSEs hasfallen by 40%and the number of arts teachers has declined by 23%.Research last year found that about half of all A-level students took at least one humanities subject a decade ago. But by 2021-22, that had fallen to 38%, with the proportion taking arts subjects such as music, design and media studiesdropping to 24%.Figures from across arts and culture told the Guardian that perceptions of the sector as inaccessible to working-class people and the rising cost of being an artist were discouraging a generation from trying to establish themselves in creative industries.“I think the real problem is that working-class people look at the arts and think this isn’t something that people like me do,” said Knight. “There is a perception across the board that there is something about the arts that is unattainable.”Meadows, the director of This Is England, said the kind of schemes and courses to which he had access as a young artist were now too rare. “The projects that existed and were open to me have vanished from so many places,” he said.View image in fullscreenUK artists say the industry is elitist and does not appear welcoming to people from different backgrounds.Composite: Guardian Design/Getty ImagesMichael Socha, who starred recently in the Meadows drama The Gallows Pole and got his start in acting via theTelevision Workshop in Nottingham, said the middle-class environment of film and TV in the UK could be difficult to navigate. “There’s a lot of impostor syndrome sometimes,” he said. “When I get a job, like a big job, I often get quite intimidated by how elitist it is.”Happy Valley’s showrunner, Sally Wainwright, said: “When I was a kid, I remember my dad saying to me: ‘People like us don’t become writers.’ He was a headteacher and a senior lecturer at a polytechnic, but he still thought that people like us didn’t make money out of writing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The game is rigged.”Darling, the 2023 Turner prize winner, said the wider issue of access to the arts for working-class people was rooted in a lack of government support and the shrinking of the welfare state.“The problem with arts participation and diversity is that there is no welfare state any more,” he said. “The Britpop acts and the Young British Artists didn’t pay for school, they lived on the dole and had housing benefits – that was their government patronage.“Now there’s wage labour and the housing crisis, and the welfare state has become increasingly difficult to access. I was able to access the last gasps of that system, including working tax credits, while university loans hadn’t ballooned to the amounts we see now.”The award-winningplaywright Beth Steelsaid she was able to get a foothold in the world of theatre by securing a place as a live-in property guardian in London where her rent, including bills, was £135 a month. That allowed her to work on her breakthrough play, Wonderland, about the mining community in Nottinghamshire where she was raised.“It is still very rare to have contemporary regional working-class voices on these big main stages, unless it’s nostalgic,” she said. “People need to see something of themselves to think there is a possibility that they can also do that.”Steel added that schemes such asTheatre 503that she was part of need to be better-funded to allow playwrights from working-class backgrounds to focus solely on writing.Mark Simpson, the composer and clarinettist who won the BBC Young Musician of the Year in 2006, said the reduction in local and national government-supported schemes meant someone from his roots would struggle to break through in the classical world today. “The limitations now that kids from my background face are almost too high to get through,” he said.Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said: “Who tells the story determines the story that is told. So if you don’t have a diverse workforce in the arts world, then too many people’s stories will be erased from our national story … As a government, we’re absolutely determined that that is going to change.”An Arts Council England spokesperson said: “We’re very aware that people seeking to forge careers in the arts can face a range of barriers, and that social class is one of them. Our own data shows clearly that the better off are better represented in the workforce.” But they said they were confident “progress could be made” and ACE has started to track social mobility within the organisations it funds.Explore more on these topicsInequalityClass act: how the British arts are failing on diversityClass issuesTelevision industryTelevisionFilm industryClassical musicnewsShareReuse this content"

A hundred years of reasons, of inequalities and wrongs and rights, of marches and riots, of peaceful sit-downs and kiss-ins, of fortitude and dissent and things kicking off. Things can get ugly. A fire bomb in the road, marbles under the horses’ hooves. Not resisting is uglier.Resistance also presents us with 100 years of photographs. Filled with incident and detail, personal shots and anonymous press images, documentary series and photographs found in archives and culled from collections, they range from journalistic assignments to surreptitious surveillance images, pictures by famous photographers and by anonymous agency ones. Conceived bySteve McQueenand curated by Clarrie Wallis, it is a show of fractured continuities and swerving vantage points.All the images have been scanned in black and white and hung in black frames. There are a few sepia-toned photos but no colour images. All the prints are relatively small and invite close looking. They gather and disperse and they march around the walls of the Turner Contemporary. The images home in and they pull back. We see crowds on the move and groups of the unemployed lying in the road to disrupt the traffic on Oxford Street.Protesters occupy tree houses high above the proposed Newbury bypass and they dance on the missile silos at Greenham Common. We find ourselves in courtrooms and cells, marching among millions and watching Arthur Scargill on the telly in someone’s sitting room in the north-east of England. There’s disenfranchised lassitude and the amazing creativity of the squatters who occupied scaffolding towers and netting above a row of houses to prevent their eviction. A couple dance wildly at an early Caribbean carnival in St Pancras Town Hall in 1959, sound systems are rigged-up in Notting Hill and anti-Iraq war activist Brian Haw begins his 670th day of protest opposite the Houses of Parliament in 2003 (his vigil lasted a decade, until his death in 2011).View image in fullscreenIndividuals as well as crowds … Brian Haw in 2005.Photograph: Andrew Wiard/reportphotos.comThere are riots in the Bogside; Tom Robinson performing at a Rock Against Racism carnival; anti-racists blocking a National Front demonstration in New Cross; and Humphrey Spender documenting the Great Depression in 1936, photographing kids playing in a derelict street in Jarrow and unemployed Tyneside workers on the Newcastle quay, the Tyne Bridge looming behind them. Images such as Spender’s, published in the popular Picture Post, gained enormous currency.Subtitled How Protest Shaped Britain andPhotographyShaped Protest, the exhibition ends at a point when social media and advances in smartphone technology began to irrevocably change our relationship with images, as well as the relationship between photographs and videos and truth.The exhibition is compelling in all sorts of ways. As social history, as documentary, as eye-witness report and as remembering, whether it is of the unemployment marches of the 1930s or the protests against the overwhelming silence surrounding the deaths of 13 young people in a house fire in New Cross in 1981. Resistance is more than a parade of markers or a timeline of dissent.Well-known protests such as the Grunwick Dispute in 1976-8, in which a group of mostly Indian female workers from east Africa walked out of the film processing factory in west London where they suffered low wages, intimidation and exploitation, or the demonstration against the poll tax in 1990, the battles for gay liberation and against Section 28, also meet largely forgotten protests here; members of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds protest “against the use of egret feathers in hats” at a demonstration in London in 1911, and blind people march from cities around England and Wales to London in 1920, petitioning for “Justice not Charity”. In the early 1990s, disabled protesters hold a “Piss on Pity” campaign challenging ITV’s patronising, celebrity telethon appeals, and 30 years on we have “crip rights” and protests.Resistance is more than a parade of markers or a timeline of dissentIt is easy to get caught up in the incidental details. The policeman wheeling his bike behind the Jarrow marchers. The kid, knock-kneed, hands in the pockets of his shorts, staring at the photographerChristine Spenglerwhile she’s taking a picture of a young British soldier on a Belfast corner in 1970. I do a double-take. The kid’s wearing a weirdly comical mask, his own resistance to the presence of soldiers on the streets.The young unemployed sit on the floor and lean at the counter in the dole office, inTish Murtha’s 1981 series Youth Unemployment. From the same series, kids leap from a high window on to a pile of old mattresses in a wretched, partly demolished housing block. An onlooker in the image is holding a ventriloquist’s dummy, which looks back out at us, a sort of bug-eyed rejoinder to our looking.John Deakin, then working for Picture Post, took a group of portraits of delegates at the 1945 Pan African Congress in Manchester. These included Jomo Kenyatta, future president of Kenya, and Jamaican Pan-African activist Amy Garvey. The photographer’s close friend Francis Bacon called Deakin the greatest portrait photographer sinceNadarandJulia Margaret Cameron.View image in fullscreen‘It is easy to get caught up in the incidental details’ … a demonstration against the imminent invasion of Iraq in London in 2003.Photograph: Andrew Wiard/reportphotos.comWe meet individuals as well as crowds here; Tony Benn, speaking in Trafalgar Square during the Suez crisis, and Bertrand Russell, at an anti-nuclear missile protest in 1961 (“Bertrand Russell – King of the kids!”, my father used to shout, whenever the aged philosopher appeared on the television). Oswald Mosley, in ridiculous jodhpurs and riding boots, exchanges a fascist salute with his blackshirt followers at a 1936 rally, and here’s Mosley again, rallying a postwar crowd. He’s ditched his absurd uniform of strongman leather belt and the boots by now.Mosley’s pre-war antisemitism gave way, by the 1970s, to the National Front and broader attacks on immigration and the Black and Asian population, leading to mass demonstrations and shows of revulsion against them. Sometimes resistance has to go on and on and it must never stop. An anti-fascist protester is led away after a mounted police baton charge during the Battle of Cable Street in 1936, and a week later fire runs in the gutter on another East End street.There are flashpoints and long-terms protest, hunger strikes and a picture of a “dirty protester” incarcerated in Belfast’s Maze Prison, smuggled out in 1979. We find covert police images of suffragettes, and another of them in court (the camera hidden in the photographer’s hat). The stories bolster the images and keep the whole thing alive.The exhibition and accompanying book – with numerous essays by Gary Younge, Paul Gilroy, Baroness Chakrabarti and others, and including first-hand accounts of protest movements and acts of resistance – has been several years in the making. McQueen’s highly personal introduction recounts his going to a Saturday school, one of several set up by Black families to help children who were being failed by the education system. It was here that McQueen learned to draw, and to gain confidence. Eventually he went to art school. The first demonstration he went on was against the introduction of student tuition fees in 1988. He knows he could not have gone to art school if he’d had to pay. “My own resistance started with me loving myself,” he writes. “My resistance was my courage to dare and push my ability.” Resistance is inspiring.Resistance is atTurner Contemporary, Margate, from 22 February to 1 JuneExplore more on these topicsPhotographySteve McQueenreviewsShareReuse this content"

She added that “it was devastating to … feel so betrayed by the system”. She is now signed to Island, a subsidiary ofUniversal MusicGroup (UMG), and her speech seemed to be addressed specifically to major labels, whose profits have soared in recent years even as revenue for artists has gone down.Musicians including Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx and Noah Kahan have backed her, each matching a $25,000 donation she made to the music mental-health charity Backline, but her speech was also met witha scathing op-edby Jeff Rabhan, a former chair of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music in New York, who called her comments misguided. His piece was widely maligned, but was symptomatic of an industry fretting at the prospect of its longstanding labour practices being revolutionised by artists.Chappell Roan accepts her award for best new artist at the 2025 Grammys – video.Stories of overwork, poor mental health and precarious contracts are common among artists; fresh concern over pastoral care has been triggered by thedrug-related deathof the singer Liam Payne, who was dropped by his label amid his addiction struggles. Jillian Banks – AKA pop musician Banks – found success in the major-label system with her first two albums in the mid-2010s, and says that, as a major-label signee you are “not really viewed as a sensitive human that creates art – you’re now a product, and so they are viewing everything through the lens of trying to make you make money for them”.She describes the label-mandated schedule she had to adhere to early in her career as “essentially inhumane – it was every day, interviews and shoots all day long, flying here and there … if you said you weren’t OK with it, there was always some sort of backlash”. Eventually, she had to begin cancelling promotional opportunities because of burnout.View image in fullscreenBanks describes the label-mandated schedule she was subjected to as ‘essentially inhumane’.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianJoey DeFrancesco, co-founder of the United Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW) group, says that labels “should certainly be providing benefits” like healthcare to artists such as those in the development stages of their career. “[Those artists] are often signing contracts where the artist is working for this label in an extremely full-time capacity – the label is providing the PR, the booking agents, all these parts of a musician’s life, so the artist is very much working for that label,” he says. “In such circumstances where you’re working full-time for an employer, the employer is supposed to give you benefits. But so often what happens is that employers intentionally misclassify employees as independent contractors or freelancers, not technically employees under legal definition, [so they] don’t give them benefits.”Musicians signed to UMG, Sony Music Entertainment (SME) and Warner Music Group (WMG) – the “big three” major labels – and their subsidiaries qualify for insurance through the Sag-Aftra union throughout the period that they are signed with the label. UMG and SME also have partnerships with the Music Health Alliance (MHA), a non-profit organisation that provides musicians with healthcare advocacy and support at no cost. (In some cases, this may be offering assistance in applying forMedicaid.)Last week,UMG announceda further partnership with MHA called the Music Industry Mental Health Fund for UMG artists and the broader industry. It’s certainly necessary: the UK mental-health charity Mind says that musicians are up tothree times more likelyto suffer from depression than non-musicians, owing to the insecure nature of their income, pressure from fans and labels, and access to alcohol and drugs. (Representatives from UMG and SME declined to comment on the record; reps for WMG were not immediately available for comment.)This coverage does not account for Roan’s appeal for broader artist support, including for those who may be tied up in development deals that ultimately result in contract termination. David Airaudi, manager of indie-pop star Steve Lacy and author of forthcoming artist handbook Made Art, says “There [have] to be systems in place to take care of the artists that drive our business,” but that “we’ve gotten so far away from that over the years.”“It’s profits over people – when you put for-profit entities in charge of products that are the result of human suffering, trial, toil and soul, you’re going to get a disconnect,” he says. Airaudi says that putting the onus on labels to provide this kind of support shifts focus away from an industry-wide problem, in which overstuffed touring schedules can become “incredibly taxing”, resulting in mental-health issues; and where managers don’t always teach financial literacy to their artists.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Following Roan’s Grammys speech, the UK songwriting groupIvors Academyannounced plans to lobby for better treatment of songwriters, including label-funded daily expenses, minimum royalty cuts from master recordings to songwriters, and more. Early last year, Rashida Tlaib and Jamaal Bowman introduced a bill to the US Congress called theLiving Wage for Musicians Act, which would require streaming services to introduce a subscription fee that would go directly to artists and to put a percentage of non-subscription revenue into a new royalty fund which would pay out directly to musicians. (UMAW worked on the bill with Tlaib and Bowman.)Earlier this week, industry executive Troy Carter – an early manager of Lady Gaga – pledged on Instagram that his label, Venice, would write healthcare stipends into its contracts, although it’s unclear whether Venice has any signees or operates beyond distribution services.Nearly a third of professional UK musicians report poor mental wellbeingRead moreBoth DeFrancesco and Airaudi say that there will always be musicians who fall through the cracks of any industry-wide pushes for healthcare, and that ultimately such initiatives are stopgaps for a country without a centrally funded national health service. “The vast majority of UMAW members are not on major labels,” says DeFrancesco. “We need musicians, like all workers, to be demanding better healthcare from their employers, but also getting organised politically to defend the Medicaid that we have right now and then expand it further into that single payer system.”In the meantime, says Banks, major labels don’t seem willing to budge on their treatment of musicians. “The way the culture is set up, it’s kind of about quantity over quality, where everything’s about money and a major label can sign an artist for one song, and if it doesn’t work out, let’s move on to the next,” she says. “If they were to actually develop artists, they would have to invest in healthcare.”Explore more on these topicsMusicMusic industryPop and rockChappell RoanMental healthUniversal MusicMedicaidfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now that Neighbours is doomed, it needs to end with a bangAfter the Austalian soap’s previous false ending, it’s almost impossible to imagine it getting a second starry finale – or it finding a new home. This time, its farewell needs to stickStuart HeritageFri 21 Feb 2025 09.50 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 09.53 ESTShareIt’s always sad to write an obituary, especially so when it’s for the second time. Neighbours, the Australian soap opera that made stars of everyone from Kylie Minogue to a man who will forever be known asToadfish, is five months away from death. Again.Yesterday, the show announced that Amazon, the company that resuscitated Neighbours two years ago after its dramatic 2022 finale, would be bringingproduction to an end. In July, filming will cease. In December, the final episode will be shown. True, there is the possibility that another buyer will leap in and save it, but that is looking more and more unlikely. After all, as the saying goes, you can’t make a zombie out of a zombie.Obviously, there’s a lot to examine from the news. Perhaps the most important lesson is that legacy franchises should really think better of jumping into bed with big tech companies. Amazon proved this twice over yesterday alone;first by buying out Eon Productions, the British company that makes the James Bond films, hinting that it will transform a venerable 63-year-old property into a nightmarish Star Wars-style sausage factory of spin-offs and TV shows, and now this. When Amazon bought Neighbours, fans hoped it was a permanent solution, continuing the soap in perpetuity. But streamers operate on a different metric to traditional broadcasters – a long-running show with a loyal audience won’t increase the number of subscribers as much as something buzzy and new – and so it has once again been snuffed out of existence.But hope springs eternal. Inevitably, someone has createda petition to save it. But even that barely has the energy to sustain itself, scraping together just over a thousand signatures in a day. Perhaps the time is right to let it go. After all, the entire history of the show has been spent teetering on the brink of cancellation.View image in fullscreenTakaya Honda (as David Tanaka), Hana Abe-Tucker (as Isla Tanaka-Brennan), Matt Wilson (as Aaron Brennan)Photograph: Jackson Finter/Amazon FreeveeIn Australia, the Seven Network cancelled it after four months before it was revived by Network Ten. It ran for 22 years on BBC One in the UK, until the channel abandoned it in 2008 after Freemantle demanded £300 million for the rights. It was saved when Channel 5 agreed to show it, paying for the bulk of production costs in the process. But even thatstarted to go south over financial disputesin 2017, before Channel 5 officially pulled the plug in 2022, tanking the show for the first time.You will remember that becausethe finale was a big deal. Several big stars who had outgrown Neighbours returned to mark the event, including Margot Robbie, Guy Pearce, Jason Donovan and a bizarrely mute Kylie Minogue. In truth it was a pretty good finale, ending with a wedding that served as a celebration of the history of Ramsay Street. If you’re old enough to have enjoyed Neighbours at its peak, it was a near-perfect send off. And then it was all undone the moment that Amazon bought the rights.View image in fullscreenFamous faces … Guy Pearce (Mike Young) and Annie Jones (Jane Harris) turned up for the first big Neighbours send off before Amazon stepped in.Photograph: Jonathan Birch/Amazon FreeveeThe new series has been, well, fine. It’s Neighbours, so it’s still equal parts plodding and implausible, but after using up all that energy saying goodbye to it once, it was hard to fully embrace its new incarnation. What was once a communal experience – playSuddenly by Angry Anderson, the soundtrack to Scott and Charlene’s wedding in 1987, to a roomful of people in their mid-40s and they’ll all end up snivelling with nostalgia – had become impossibly fragmented. At times it felt like you were the only person in the world watching Neighbours.Now there’s nowhere else to go. It seems likeNeighbourshas run out of road for good. Hopefully, this time it will do the dignified thing and stay dead. If nothing else, a new ending means that it will soon be time for a new finale. This is something to be excited about, at least. After all, the show has blown the chance of another celebrity-filled nostalgiafest because Kylie Minogue clearly isn’t going to risk her reputation by showing up to say goodbye again. So that only leaves the route of harrowing finality.This is Neighbours’ chance to go big or go home. Nothing short of total destruction will do. We’re talking plane crashes, volcanoes, axe murderers. By the time the end credits roll, I want the few remaining viewers permanently traumatised. We cannot risk the possibility of another embarrassing about-face here. If someone wants to make a petition to destroy Erinsborough with an asteroid attack, I promise to sign it first.Explore more on these topicsNeighboursTelevisionDramaSoap operafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We are used to increasingly long gaps between their release, but with no new lead actor in sight, Bond 26 has still not even reached the starting gate. Eon kept the quest for a new Bond behind completely closed doors, like a sort of state secret, but Bezos’s first act has been to throw the gates open, with an Elon Musk-esque act of quasi-crowdsourcing. It may be just a PR-grabbing gesture, but it demonstrates that Amazon is planning to do things differently from now on.View image in fullscreenPassing the baton … Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli in 2024.Photograph: Valérie Macon/AFP/Getty ImagesThe focus, understandably, is how Amazon might develop the franchise. Eon’s method has been to protect the brand like hawks, pouring all their efforts into one huge film, and refusing all suggestions of spin-offs, adaptations, remakes. And it worked: every Bond film has been a box office giant, meaning that this 60-year-old spy-movie series is still bigger than Batman, Lord of the Rings or X-Men. (The only time Broccoli and Wilson caved in to the pressure of a TV spin-off wasAmazon’s poorly recieved challenge show 007: Road to a Million, which they presumably felt was far enough removed from the core Bond purpose that it couldn’t really dilute it.) Amazon will be undoubtedly looking to other mainstream “cinematic universes” as a model, and seeking to imitate Star Wars and Marvel’s mix of “main narrative” feature films, standalone spin-off films (Moneypenny: The Early Years and the like), and streaming shows (Rosa Klebb’s Adventures in Space/Time, with any luck) to extend the reach of the storylines.Of course, picking a new Bond is vital, and who Amazon settles on will determine the nature of what follows. Eon, to outsiders, seemed caught between keeping the traditional audience on side by picking someone not dissimilar to previous incumbents (ie British, white, male, in early middle age) and following its own liberal instincts by installing an actor outside that demographic (towards which they made a tentative move giving Lashana Lynch a role as 007 in No Time to Die). Idris Elbafor years was touted as a possible replacementbut, as the actor himself said in the past, the blunt truth is that, at 52, he is probably to be too old.The bookies’ choicesare more traditional: Happy Valley’s James Norton, Aaron Taylor Johnson (Kick-Ass, Kraven the Hunter, Nocturnal Animals etc), and Babygirl’s Harris Dickinson. Will Bezos go down the progressive route? In the current political climate it’s – frankly – become much less likely.View image in fullscreenJames Norton, pictured at last week’s Baftas, is one of the bookies’ favourites for the next Bond.Photograph: Joe Maher/Getty Images for BaftaHowever, Amazon’s first order of business isn’t casting; it’ll have to appoint an executive (or team) to supervise the franchise. (Experience has shown that even the biggest movie operations need focused figureheads to run things, a la Kevin Feige at Marvel, Kathleen Kennedy at Star Wars, and James Gunn and Peter Safran for DC.) What Amazon is really after, in common with the other standalone giants Netflix and Apple, is to crack the blockbuster movie business, something that for all its prowess in delivering product, it has never really managed – in sharp contrast to the streamer’s conquest of high-end TV. All the while the established Hollywood studios, led by Disney and Warner Bros, have used their film-making prowess to make inroads into the streamers’ core business, using their own bespoke players (Disney+ and Max respectively). Purchasing expensive IP, as Disney did with Star Wars and Marvel, as Netflix did with Narnia and Amazon itself with Tolkien, is the main weapon.Bezos’s first act has been to throw the gates openThe way Bond films are financed will probably change also. Eon wasthe master of the brand partnership, with which it accrued vast amounts of production funding: leaked emails revealed that Heineken paid £28m to be involved in Skyfall; in return,they got Craig for a huge global advertising campaign. With less need to focus on individual films’ finances, Amazon may feel less obliged to continue Bond’s brand-stuffed aesthetic, and may feel less inclined to cast a lead who looks good holding a beer can. But it remains to be seen how far Amazon will go in developing Bond as a “universe”; Eon made its own tentative attempts to establish a set of potential spin-off villains in Spectre, but appeared to retreat from that back to winding up Bond’s personal narrative in No Time to Die. There is a finite amount of original Bond material to draw on, however, and that point seemed to be reached several movies back, with Quantum of Solace the most recent title actually taken from a Fleming story. (All practical possibilities seem to have been exhausted; we’re never likely to see films called The Hildebrand Rarity or Risico.)The timing of the deal means that Broccoli and Wilson have chosen to bow out as the series is at a crossroads; decisions made now will affect it for years. Having shepherded Bond together since 1995, the half-brother and sister team have overseen two major transformations (to Pierce Brosnan, and then Craig) and can look back with complete satisfaction. The keys to the Bond kingdom are now entirely in Amazon’s hands.Explore more on these topicsFilmJames BondAmazon Prime VideoAction and adventure filmsanalysisShareReuse this content"

She talks old flames, being tucked up in bed for her new Agatha Christie mystery, and why she’s happiest when surrounded by donkeysFri 21 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTShareGiven that Lady Tressilian rarely leaves her boudoir, it was an enjoyable role. “I was very happily in bed, one of my favourite places, generally,” saysAnjelica Huston, of the regal aristo she plays in the new BBC adaptation of the 1944 Agatha Christie mystery Towards Zero. Despite the fact she is mostly horizontal, occasionally at a chair by the window and peering through a telescope at the Devon bay beyond, Tressilian is a domineering character, presiding over the younger relations she has assembled at her seaside home and making her displeasure known at their various life choices. There will, of course, be murders.Huston was reminded of the older women she had known from her childhood in Ireland, “mostly on the hunting field, but occasionally in their bedrooms. They were very dignified and gracious, and they ran life with a rod of steel. They were very brave and had big reputations. The men were always a bit in the background.” Tressilian’s bell rings, and everyone from servants to her relations and lawyer (he’s there on the thorny matter of her will), is commanded to attention. “It’s a great way to presage a character, an inbuilt warning,” says Huston.In Huston’s long and impressive career – one that won her an Oscar in 1986 for Prizzi’s Honor, and has seen her work with just about everybody including Francis Ford Coppola, Woody Allen and Wes Anderson, as well as her father, John Huston – she has arrived at the regal roles. Her Lady Tressilian is elegant and beautiful, and also looks her age. This is not a role that, to unfairly name names, someone such as Jane Fonda and her fabulous facelift could have played convincingly. “It’s true, she looks too good,” says Huston, who is 73, with a laugh.View image in fullscreen‘I was very happily in bed’ … Anjelica Huston as Lady Tressilian in the BBC Agatha Christie adaptation, Towards Zero.Photograph: James PardonThere doesn’t seem to be a huge amount of vanity to Huston. A great beauty, though unconventional, she was largely spared the maddening fate of leading actresses who were aged out of roles, and she thinks of herself as “a character actor first. Those are the roles that have always appealed to me, the ones that have something going on underneath.” It’s one reason she wanted to play Tressilian, a small but delicious role. “When I was a child, I used to watch a lot of restoration comedy, and I knew those actresses’ work very well – Edith Evans and Margaret Rutherford – and they were guiding lights. There was no shame to having fun with playing women of a certain age.”She loves to work but, she adds, “not too hard, and with people I love”. Home for now is her ranch, where she’s calling from after fleeing her Los Angeles home in the wildfires. “It’s been kind of a scary month,” she says. “My house almost burned down. It came very, very close. My electricity and water and power are still off, but we were safe.” She hopes to return soon, but her luck at having a beautiful place to escape to is not lost on her. There, she has seven donkeys, six horses and countless dogs and cats. “I’m always happiest when I’m surrounded by my animals.”Huston doesn’t seem old enough to have packed in what seems like several lifetimes. Her parents, the swashbuckling director John Huston and Enrica Soma, a model and ballerina, moved from the US to Ireland in the early 1950s, in horror at the McCarthy witch-hunts. For Huston, it was a wild, country childhood, punctuated with visits from fabulous friends of her parents – the war photographer Robert Capa photographed Huston and her older brother as toddlers; the writer John Steinbeck dressed up as Father Christmas one year. School holidays were spent on her father’s sets. When her parents separated and Huston moved to England, she hit London in the 60s as it was in full swing. By the time she was a model – first photographed by Richard Avedon, a friend of her mother, and soon by David Bailey – and living in New York, she was there in time for the Studio 54 years, befriending Andy Warhol and others.View image in fullscreenFamily plot… Anjelica Huston (far right) in Wes Anderson’s The Royal Tenenbaums.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyIt wasn’t all glitter. Huston’s mother died in a car accident when she was 17. Huston had a couple of relationships that could be considered abusive, and she can’t escape the fact that she was an unwitting witness – though she maintains she didn’t see anything – following Roman Polanski’s arrest for drugging and raping a 13-year-old. Huston had arrived at her on-off boyfriend Jack Nicholson’s house the next day, to find Polanski there with the girl, Samantha Gailey. Huston has said before that Polanski, who fled the US before sentencing in 1978, had “paid his price”. Has anything changed her mind in the intervening years? “No, nothing’s changed,” says Huston. “I didn’t see it, I wasn’t privy to it. I don’t feel like I was part of it.”Huston always wanted to be an actor. “From the age of six,” she says, “when I played one of the three witches in Macbeth. Actually, I left the stage rather prematurely – I declared that I didn’t like it, made myself scarce for a few hours, but I always had a weakness for character acting.” What grabbed her about it? “The reality of it – of playing a mean old witch. It was one of the more fun things you could do.”When she was 16, her father cast her in A Walk With Love and Death. It didn’t go well – they clashed on set, and her reviews were terrible. How did that affect her? “I didn’t work for years after that. He thought he was doing me a big favour and, in fact, it was very difficult. I didn’t really like the part, and it left me a bit at sea. I wasn’t comfortable, and I went back to London and went back to school, very despondent.” It shook her confidence and it would be about four years before she tried acting again. “I knew that I could act, but I didn’t know how to convince anyone else that I knew how to act.”Instead, she became a model. For many young women, it was an industry with situations that were dangerous and intimidating, but Huston says she didn’t experience that. “I worked with really good people who were very protective. It was a very freeing atmosphere, and the designers and the photographers were always very much on my side. I felt like I could do anything.” It was a time for young women, she says, where “we were the first rung of girls who were allowed to have a good time. It was encouraged, we were kind of wild.”View image in fullscreen‘A small but delicious role’ … Anjelica Huston gives an imperious performance in the classic murder mystery.Photograph: Justin Downing/James PardonShe had a much older boyfriend, the fashion photographer Bob Richardson – she was 18 to his 42. Does that not look dubious with a modern perspective on power dynamics? “It was dubious then,” she points out. “He, I would say, was the least good thing about all of that [period], in that I felt like I had to please him. He was a great photographer and knew exactly what he wanted, and there’s nothing better than that, but he was also very challenging and critical, and I had a hard time negotiating how to be.”It didn’t diminish her; Huston seemed to have a well of self-confidence. She wasn’t knocked when one powerful modelling agent told her she needed a nose job, nor when a producer refused to give her a pay rise on Prizzi’s Honor and she overheard him telling her agent she was no good, and he hadn’t wanted her in the film anyway. How did that not crush her? “I think my reaction, which was healthy, was: ‘Well, watch me.’ I always came out swinging and I didn’t have to make excuses for myself. I remember being properly outraged, and thinking: ‘He thinks he knows, but he doesn’t, so I’ll just show him.’” Her performance won her an Oscar.By then, Huston had been in a long relationship with Nicholson, who also starred in the film. Nicholson’s infidelities were legendary over their on-off 17-year relationship, ending finally in 1990 when he fathered a child with someone else (Huston soon would have a happy marriage to the sculptor Robert Graham, until his death in 2008). Why did she stay with Nicholson for so long? “I loved him. I think in the world that I was living in, it wasn’t disrespectful. It was how he was, and it wasn’t so personal. I think as soon as I clocked that, it was all right, I knew how to protect myself. It didn’t make me happy, but I knew what I was doing.” It allowed her to prioritise herself – with work, with other lovers. “I did what I wanted to do, and I did it with sureness. If I wanted something, I knew how to go after it, so it wasn’t as though anything was being done to me. I wasn’t a wilting flower.”They are still in touch. Nicholson called Huston recently as she was fleeing the wildfires. “I was in a car with three dogs, two cats, and the housekeeper, and he called and asked if I was all right, and if I had someplace I was staying. That’s the bottom line with he and I – when the chips are down, he’s there.”Life has taught her to look for beauty: “Remember to admire what’s beautiful and be on the side of beauty and on the side of what you can do to make things better.” She does this when she thinks about her country. “America, at the moment, is in a sad and sorry state. I think it has a lot to learn and hopefully won’t have to learn it the hard way. The world is beautiful, and if you can find something beautiful in [the US], then you’re already on the right track.” It’s hard not to be hopeless, she says, “but there’s a lot to admire too.”Agatha Christie’s Towards Zero starts on BBC One, and is available in full on BBC iPlayer, on 2 March.Explore more on these topicsAnjelica HustonTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

The Colombian architects overturning colonialist ‘sustainability’ ideasA 30-acre construction lab is helping reshape Colombia’s architecture with ancestral knowledge and direct ecological action. We head inside their smoking doughnutOliver WainwrightFri 21 Feb 2025 07.20 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 08.05 ESTShareAcurious doughnut-shaped structure rises from an overgrown field on the outskirts of Tenjo, a rural town in centralColombia. It looks like a thatched UFO. Bamboo lattice walls curve up from the ground to form its bulging shell, tapering to a central chimney where wisps of smoke waft into the sky. Through the mesh walls, it is possible to make out bodies dancing in a circle around a fire, to the sound of drumming and chanting.“As architects, we need to unlearn everything we have been taught,” says Ana María Gutiérrez, standing outside this momentous structure in muddy overalls, boots and a broad-brimmed black hat. “Our idea of progress is completely based on colonialist, extractivist practices. People talk about sustainability, but what exactly are we sustaining?”The woven doughnut, Gutiérrez explains, is The House of Thought – an “intercultural temple” at the heart of herCentre for Regeneration. This is a 30-acre outdoor laboratory for indigenous construction techniques that she’s been building for 16 years. It is a place scattered with experiments, from structures that look like coil pots, to little domed houses built from sandbags. Some of the cavorting bodies inside the thatched temple belong to architects, who have come here for the day to cleanse themselves of their desk jobs, and get their hands dirty in workshops focusing on earth construction, ecological restoration, biodynamic agriculture and the healing properties of medicinal plants. Some are busy making bricks from troughs of mud.View image in fullscreenCleansing … the interior of House of Thought.Photograph: Fundacion OrganizmoLike many of the day’s participants, Gutiérrez used to work in a corporate architecture practice, in her case in New York. One day, while on holiday back home in Colombia, she travelled to Barichara, in the north, to take part in a workshop on rammed earth. “The moment I was barefoot,” she says, “working with the earth, I was like, ‘What am I doing sitting at a desk, working on a computer all day, every day?’”She returned to Colombia in 2008, after inheriting land in Tenjo. Here, she resolved to create a centre for ecologically minded construction and “learning through sensorial experiences”. She established Fundación Organizmo, which helps remote tribal communities preserve and enhance their ancient skills. “What if we saw ancestral knowledge not as a romantic past,” she asks, “but as a vivid present that could teach us resilience?”With the help of a grant from theRe:Arc Institute, a non-profit that addresses climate breakdown,Fundación Organizmo has been working with villagers in the remote jungles of Matavén, along the Orinoco River in eastern Colombia, at the border with Venezuela. Here, thePiaroa de la Urbanacommunity has long relied on growing palm – for weaving everyday objects, and to build with. “The weaving techniques are in danger of disappearing,” says Gutiérrez. “Only a few of the older generation know how to. So we designed a classroom with the community and created a curriculum to help preserve the tradition.”A second project, in Vaupés to the south-east, takes a more activist approach. Here, Organizmo is working with the Takaka collective, formed of young researchers from eight ethnic groups, to make films about the challenges facing local leaders battling land exploitation. “We want to show the differences between ancestral leadership and the sort of political leadership we are experiencing at this time,” saysKaren Meneces, a member of the Guanano. “We are going to show our cultures, our daily life, our beliefs, our dances. We want to make people aware of our flora and fauna, and the richness of our resources.”These projects are typical of the amorphous initiatives that Re:Arc funds, operating somewhere between architecture, community organising and climate action. Established in 2022, the Copenhagen-based charity is funded by the Inter Ikea Foundation, the ultimate owner of Ikea, which made €2.2bn (£1.8bn) in profits last year. The ecological focus of its grants is not surprising. Ikea is the world’s largest consumer of wood and, over the years, the flat-pack furniture giant has come under fire for its environmental impact, accused of fuelling throwaway culture and accelerating the deforestation of protected areas. A recentGreenpeace investigationclaimed that Ikea’s suppliers were sourcing timber from some of Europe’s last remaining old-growth forests in Romania. Other reports have highlighted the company’s links to illegal logging inSiberia,UkraineandBrazil, as well asforced prison labour in Belarus.Ikea refutes Greenpeace’s accusations, insisting that the sourcing practices outlined in the report are legal. The company says it has ceased working with the Brazilian supplier, no longer sources wood from Siberia, and has terminated all contracts in Belarus. “Under no circumstances do we accept illegally logged wood, and we work actively to ensure that such wood is not used in our products,” Ikea said in a statement. “We do this through working actively with control measures via a comprehensive due diligence system which contains multiple safeguards. While no system guarantees against all risks, when we receive indications of misconduct, we immediately investigate and act on them.”View image in fullscreen‘Weaving techniques are in danger of disappearing’ … the Centre for Regeneration.Photograph: Fundacion OrganizmoRe:Arc doesn’t emphasise its links to Ikea, but its work could be seen as a small form of penance for its funder’s environmental sins – channelling some of the Billy bookcase fortune towards planetary restoration. Over the past two years,it has distributed grantsof €15m (£13.4m) to 76 groups across more than 40 countries, ranging from indigenous minorities in Bangladesh to a participatory building charity for young people in London. Its current focus is on Latin America and the Caribbean, which holds half of the world’s biodiversity, and has lost 240,000 hectares of protected land to deforestation. It is also where Ikea is pursuinga $600m (£474m) expansion plan, with new stores in Mexico, Chile, Peru and Colombia. A 26,000 sq m store opened in Bogotá in 2023, followed by one in Cali, with another popping up in Medellín last October.A half-hour metro ride north of Medellín’s new megastore lies the neighbourhood of Moravia, where Re:Arc has also been working. The area was once home to a gigantic landfill site, the toxic dumping ground of what was then the most dangerous city on the planet. When it closed in 1984, desperate families started building their homes on top of the dump using whatever they could find, and the place swelled into an informal shantytown, ruled by rival drug gangs. In the early 2000s, as part of somesweeping transformations, the trash mound was turned into an urban park, community centres were built, and residents were allowed to legally purchase their homes.“A lot of people were relocated during the transformation,” says German architect Max Becker, who first came here 11 years ago. “They were put in seven-storey buildings, cut off from public transport, with no public facilities.” He started to bring his architecture students here from Berlin, and organised workshops with local people, which sawa new public staircasebuilt through a poorly connected part of the neighbourhood. “As soon as we started, we had so many volunteers,” he says. “People donated concrete, paint and solar panels for lighting at night.”View image in fullscreenA temporary bamboo community centre … Taller Tropical.Photograph: Oasis UrbanoTogether with community leader Cielo María Holguín Ramírez, who grew up in Moravia, Becker establishedOasis Urbano, a “think-and-do-tank” dedicated to co-creating urban improvements with local residents, a bottom-up alternative to Medellín’s top-down model.“I saw so many people killing each other on the street when I was a child,” says Holguín Ramírez. “Nobody wanted to come to Moravia. But over the last 35 years, it has become a safe, diverse and productive neighbourhood, through the commitment of the residents to improve their own area.”Oasis Urbano has since worked on building a linear park and a new public square, witha big mosaic mapset into the ground, giving people a sense of ownership over the area – which is continually threatened with redevelopment.In 2018, they built a temporary bamboo community centre, calledTaller Tropical. Over its three-year life, it hosted 10,000 people at events ranging from concerts, lectures, open-air cinema screenings and classes in everything from cooking and furniture-making to juggling and self-defence. With the help of Re:Arc, they are now working towards a more permanent venue, the Escuela Popular. It will be a bright yellow multistorey affair, with a restaurant and community kitchen on the ground floor, a library and space for artist residencies, and a roof terrace for cultural and educational activities. Construction is set to begin later this year. “We think of the whole building as an experiment,” says Becker, “which can also change depending on the needs of the community.”There will also be a “fab lab”, focused on recycling waste, where perhaps some Ikea furniture may one day end up – discarded Järvfjällets and Malms ready to be reborn in the cycle of extraction, consumption and corporate social responsibility.Hear more about the work of Organizmo and other low-impact Colombian architects atArchitecture on Stage: Learning from Colombia, at the Barbican, London, on 13 March.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureColombiaRegenerationCommunitiesAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet, just three weeks into Trump’s second term, the man responsible for stripping women in the US of the right to an abortion was declared a “feminist kween”, “feminist hero” and “feminist icon” by several prominent feminist writers in the UK.The occasion for these declarations was Trump’s all-out assault on trans rights. Since taking office, the president has used executive orders to attempt to restrict the ability of trans Americans totravel,work, receivemedical care, serve in themilitary, attendschooland participate in women’ssports. Though there are thought to befewer than 10 trans athletesamong the more than half a million competing in college sports in the US, it was this sports-related executive order that prompted certain, trans-exclusionary feminists to declare Trump’s feminist bona fides.View image in fullscreenEnemy Feminisms, by Sophie Lewis.Photograph: Haymarket BooksHow did we get here? How have we arrived at a place where self-identified feminists ally themselves with a man who has so extravagantly dedicated his personal and political lives to the humiliation, domination and degradation of women and girls?I brought this question to Sophie Lewis, whose new book, Enemy Feminisms, out this week in the US, seeks to understand how and why some forms of feminism have diverged so fundamentally from others as to become, well, enemies.When we spoke by phone, I mentioned to Lewis that my strategy for dealing with such feminisms has tended toward repudiation. I have long maintained a personal policy of avoiding the term “Terf”, an initialism for “trans-exclusionary radical feminist”, because I reject the idea that the underlying ideology qualifies as feminism.“It is difficult – I would say impossible – to say that [Terfism] is not feminism, that the philosophical and movement roots of their whole deal is not feminism,” Lewis said. “That’s the bad news. But the good news is that there were always other feminists fighting them tooth and nail.“It hurts and confuses us to imagine that there are anti-liberatory feminisms, but I think when we do allow that and we do conceptually break that possibility open, that’s when it becomes possible to stake out our ground as an anti-colonial, proletarian, trans feminism,” she continued.An independent scholar and self-described radical, Lewis was raised in France and educated in the UK, and now lives in the US. Her previous books have advocatedfamily abolition, an idea that seeks to de-privatize the care and social reproduction that capitalism assigns to nuclear families.They are reacting to something real … but they are making, essentially, a fascist choiceEnemy Feminisms is structured as a “bestiary of enemy feminisms”, tracing reactionary tendencies in western feminism all the way back toMary Wollstonecraftand taking on such archetypes as “the civilizer”, “the KKK feminist”, “the pornophobe” and “the prohibitionist”. Throughout, Lewis shows how feminists have been shaped – and misshaped – by the ideologies and historical conditions of their times, from the opportunities that slavery and imperialism afforded some white women to the strictures of working within a liberal democracy and the seductive lure of violence.And what a bestiary it is. We begin with Wollstonecraft’s 1792 essay A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, a foundational text for feminism and a prime example of how feminist analysis can contain its own forms of misogyny (Lewis calls it “the original claim to beingnot like the other girls”) and straight-up white supremacy. Wollstonecraft’s inability – or unwillingness – to parse the difference between the chattel slavery imposed by the British Empire on Black people and the metaphorical “slavery” of upper-class married Englishwomen is only the first example.View image in fullscreenMary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797).Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesHere we have May French Sheldon, a wealthy American feminist who in 1891 traveled “alone and unescorted” – that is, carried by 150 hired African workers but no white people – through Kenya and Tanzania beneath a US flag and a banner reading “noli me tangere” (touch me not), only to report on her return that everywhere she went, Africans had gathered around “entreating her to remain and rule over them”. She would go on to make several trips to Africa and become a staunch denialist of the Belgian genocide in the Congo. Sheldon’s is one of several forms of feminism that can only be expressed through the domination of people of color, an original sin of the movement that still troubles it today. (Lewis draws a direct line from Sheldon to Israel’s promotion of so-called “lionesses of the desert” who fought for thefirst time on the frontlinesin Israel’s war on Gaza, writing: “Genocide is sometimes feminist.”)And here we have Mary Richardson, a British suffragette whose enthusiasm for the movement’s campaign of violence, arson and bombing saw her earn the nickname “Slasher” after she took a meat cleaver to a Diego Velázquez nude in the National Gallery. After the first world war, Richardson joined the British Union of Fascists and quickly assumed leadership of the women’s section, only to be expelled, two years later, for demanding “fair play” for women.While popular feminist history often idealizes the British suffragettes, and lingers particularly on thebrutal violenceenacted upon their bodies by the British state, Lewis argues that more attention must be paid to the violence they themselves carried out. Emmeline Pankhurst’s band of feminist activists “detonated as many bombs between 1912–13 as the Irish Republican Army did during its 1939–40 ‘S-Plan’”, she writes.View image in fullscreenSuffragette Mary Richardson is arrested by police for throwing a document into the carriage of King George V in Bristol in July 1913.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images“To this day, it’s not particularly popular in academia to talk about this bombing and violence unless you are basically an anti-feminist,” she says. And while Lewis does not want to denounce violent tactics across the board, she warns: “I think we need to talk about how movements that lean heavily on terrorism are likely to take an authoritarian internal form that very much favors a rightward political lurch.”For some suffragettes, that lurch came thanks to the onset of the first world war. When Pankhurst ordered her followers to stop bombing the British state and start helping to arm it for the war effort, it left some of the most radicalized to fall into “a feminist-fascist estuary formed in the crater generated by Mrs Pankhurst’s pivot from law-breaking insurgency to conformist cheerleading”.Betrayed and disillusioned, these suffragettes lost faith in the democratic system and found a new hero to worship in Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Union of Fascists. “How do we make sense of that?” Lewis asks. “They are reacting to something real … but they are making, essentially, a fascist choice.” Lewis compares what she calls a “feminism of fools” to the idea of the “socialism of fools” – that is, the way in which awareness of structural injustice in the economy can veer away from Marxist analysis toward antisemitic conspiracy theories.View image in fullscreenMary Sophia Allen, a ‘commandant’ of the Women’s Auxiliary Service, aboard the SS President Harding following a visit to New York, circa 1924.Photograph: FPG/Getty ImagesAnother feminist ancestor in this tradition was Mary Sophia Allen. A British suffragette, Allen jumped at the opportunity the first world war gave her to “larp” (live-action role play) as a kind of volunteer auxiliary police officer, patrolling the private lives of working-class women living near troop installations. Her postwar career saw her traveling the world as a “woman’s police’ consultant”, promoting the dubious but persistent idea that criminalizing women’s sex lives can be feminist if a woman is the one applying the handcuffs. She wore a police uniform and monocle, called herself the “commandant” and spent a considerable amount of time in Spain and Germany, where she developed both a dedication to fascism and personal relationships with Francisco Franco and Adolf Hitler.In Enemy Feminisms, Lewis also takes on the anti-pornography turn that some radical feminists took in the 1970s and 1980s, the rise of the Islamophobic femonationalist (“death by drone bomb is better (and more feminist) for women than life is under sharia law”), the 21st-century girlboss (“we might consider beginning with a general girlstrike”) and, finally, the “adult human female” – or Terf.Though trans-exclusionary feminism originated with a subset of radical American feminists in the 1970s, Lewis notes that the ideas found little support in the US beyond a tiny fringe of eco-feminists and theexplicitly anti-feminist religious right. Anti-trans thinking survived and thrived in the UK, however, becoming part of establishment feminism, only to be “exported back to the US in the 21st century like an unholy boomerang”, she says.American rightwing transphobia was only able to roar into life after the infusion of radical-feminist language, framing, support and vocabularyTerfism grows from many of the tendencies of previous enemy feminisms, Lewis demonstrates, such as the “femmephobia” of Wollstonecraft and the 19th-century moral panic around “white slavery” that drove some feminists to embrace prohibitionism and xenophobia. She also draws an analogy between Terfism’sinaccurateinsistence on sex as an immutable binary and contemporary nationalism.“It’s almost like a nationalism of sex,” she says of Terfism. “At the psychic level, they want strong borders, and they want to make sexuation great again.”Enemy Feminisms debuts at a perilous moment in the growing global movement for state repression of trans people; its blatantly rightwing, authoritarian and religious nature (key proponents include Trump,Vladimir Putin,Viktor Orbán,Giorgia Meloniandthe Vatican) is complicated by the alibi afforded it by a handful of trans-exclusionary feminists. It is thanks to their efforts that Trump can frame a bigoted attack on a minority as “defending women from gender ideology”.Lewis is not the first to connect Terfism to the rising power of the global far right. The philosopher and gender studies scholar Judith Butler haswarned for yearsof the growing movement against “gender” – and the damage that feminist transphobia does to the coalition building needed tocombat fascism. “Continuing the ‘anti-gender ideology’ discourse places contemporary ‘radical feminists’ in a position of woeful complicity with the key aims of new fascism,” they wrote in the 2024 book Who’s Afraid of Gender.View image in fullscreenJudith Butler in 2022.Photograph: Europa Press News/Europa Press/Getty Images“It is not unfair to hold anti-trans British feminists co-responsible for this agenda of the religious right [in the US],” says Lewis. “The historical record is very clear about this: American rightwing transphobia was only able to roar into life after the infusion of radical-feminist language, framing, support and vocabulary.”Some Terfs who bestowed the title of “feminist” on Trump claim to have done so begrudgingly and despite, not because of, most of his personal and political assaults on women. But others appear to welcome his support. On 9 February, the author and anti-trans activist JK Rowlingcredited Trumpwith influencing anti-trans policies in the UK andexpressedhope that he would also help stymy a proposed UK ban on conversion therapy for transgender youth, saying: “I suppose we have to hope Trump says it soon. Then, maybe, they’ll listen.”To publish a book that amounts, in a certain light, to an annotated enemies list is its own provocation, and Lewis is bracing herself for criticism from feminists who might view the current climate as the wrong time for infighting, or who prefer not to focus on the skeletons in feminism’s closet. But Lewis argues that it is an especially urgent time to fight fascism, even if that means fighting fascist feminists. And she claims that the project was ultimately “a sort of love letter to feminism”.“I belong to feminism,” she told me. “The first passionate feelings I ever had, the first political animus I ever harbored, at four years old, were feminist, and I have chosen to stick with feminism or – to invoke a Donna Haraway phrase – to stay with the trouble and to not cede the ground of feminism to these actors who are unfortunately also grounded in feminist ancestry and feminist history.”Last fall, when Lewis was looking ahead to the book’s release, she anticipated that its reception would occur under a freshly inaugurated President Kamala Harris. The ultimate glass ceiling being broken by a politician who embodies Lewis’s archetype of “the policewoman” might have made for interesting discussions. How might leftwing feminists have reconciled our relief at achieving relative safety from a second Trump presidency with its coming through the elevation of aGlock-owning,sex worker-prosecuting, “most lethal fighting force in the world”-touting Black and South Asian woman?View image in fullscreenKamala Harris in November 2024.Photograph: Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesThose conversations won’t happen now. The re-election of Trump has demonstrated resoundingly the weaknesses ofHarris’s brand of feminism, even as it has precipitated crises in every aspect of American life that demand a feminist response.“My God, you know, it’s a scary time,” Lewis told me, when I asked her what comes next for feminism, “but I suppose one might optimistically say that the lay of the land now becomes a little clearer.”“People know what to do, in many ways because they’ve been forced to do it for so long. You know, people in the south had no abortion access long before Roe v Wade was stricken down, and they’ve been making abortion happen anyway, for decades. The same goes for estrogen, which is being distributed all across the country, DIY … People are literally doing DIY healthcare for themselves. They are standing up for each other in the face of eviction, in the face of deportation, in the face of sexual violence and familial abuse and patriarchal terror … That’s just how feminism works.”Enemy Feminisms: Terfs, Policewomen, and Girlbosses Against Liberation is published byHaymarket BooksExplore more on these topicsFeminismWomenGenderTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsDonald TrumpThe far rightinterviewsShareReuse this content"

He had been living with Parkinson’s disease.Born to a poor family in Mississippi and then raised in Chicago, Butler originally trained to be a chef – “Jerry could cook like somebody’s mama,” Smokey Robinson later said – but became an influential and versatile musician who came of age as soul music evolved out of doo-wop and mid-century pop.He brought his gospel music background to bear on one of his earliest songs, For Your Precious Love – named as one of the500 greatest of all time by Rolling Stone in 2004– which he wrote and then performed with his group Jerry Butler and the Impressions, taking it to No 11 in the US charts in 1958.View image in fullscreenJerry Butler, top left, and Curtis Mayfield, bottom right, in the Impressions.Photograph: Gilles Petard/RedfernsThe group also featured Butler’s childhood friend Curtis Mayfield, who fronted them after Butler left for a solo career – they found further success with songs such as People Get Ready. But the Butler-Mayfield collaboration continued, with Mayfield writing or co-writing a number of solo Butler songs, including He Will Break Your Heart, a No 7 hit in 1960. Butler also co-wrote other hits, such as Otis Redding’s I’ve Been Loving You Too Long.Butler also found success with his takes on a series of pop standards, including Moon River and Make It Easy on Yourself, but his biggest hit of all was self-penned: Only the Strong Survive, which reached No 4 in 1969. It was co-written with powerhouse Philadelphia duo Gamble and Huff, and together they scored a number of other hits. He earned the nickname “Iceman” for his cool, collected demeanour on stage: “I came through a period when the Isley Brothers were jumping off the stage, and James Brown was sliding across the floor. But I am just a standup singer,” he said.A cover of He Will Break Your Heart became a US No 1 hit for Tony Orlando and Dawn in 1975, under the title He Don’t Love You (Like I Love You). But his own musical success waned in that decade, and he ended up focusing on a beer distribution company he’d founded in 1973.Come the 1980s, he decided to move into politics, and in 1986 was elected to the Board of Commissioners in Cook County, Illinois – it acts as the legislature for the area, and oversees courts, prisons, healthcare and more. He held a position on the 17-strong board until his retirement in 2018.He was made a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 as a member of the Impressions, and his sizeable songbook was also later sampled by hip-hop artists including Snoop Dogg and Missy Elliott.Explore more on these topicsSoulPop and rockIllinoisnewsShareReuse this content"

Clarke has filed 15 witness statements in support of his case.The court of appeal judgment noted “almost all” of the witnesses were expected to give evidence at the libel trial in March.The case before the appeal court related to a late application from Clarke’s legal team to introduce a claim of “unlawful means conspiracy”, which would have involved adding six proposed co-defendants.They include the Guardian’s head of investigations, Paul Lewis, and five other people who were journalistic sources or individuals Clarke claims were confidential journalistic sources.At a pre-trial review hearing on 20 January, lawyers for the Guardian described Clarke’s conspiracy claim and attempt to join the six co-defendants as “meritless” and “a means of trying to avoid the March trial and of intimidating and deterring witnesses”.However, in legal submissions to the court of appeal this week, Clarke’s legal team described the proposed six co-defendants as “conspirators” and accused them of being involved in a criminal attempt to “sabotage his career and reputation”.The issue before the court of appeal was not the application itself, but whether it should be heard before or after the trial.Steyn had ruled that hearing Clarke’s “conspiracy” application in the few weeks remaining before the trial would threaten to disrupt proceedings. She noted that Clarke’s application could result in an adjournment to the trial.“The nature of the claim is such that there are numerous witnesses who are due to give evidence in relation to allegations of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct. The articles, as I have said, were almost all published four years ago, and the trial has been listed for quite some time,” she said.“I accept that many of the witnesses have been anxiously awaiting it and that it has been looming over them, casting a shadow over their lives. If the trial date were to be adjourned, potentially for many months, then there is the risk that the court would not necessarily have the benefit of all the witnesses who are currently prepared to give evidence.”Steyn added she was “not persuaded” that such considerations were outweighed by any prejudice to Clarke if the application was postponed until after the trial.In the court of appeal ruling on Friday, Warby said: “If the judge makes no error of law, takes the relevant factors into account, does not overlook any relevant matters and reaches a tenable conclusion it is not for this court to substitute its own assessment.”His decision to dismiss Clarke’s appeal was supported by the other appeal court judges, Lord Justice Popplewell and Lord Justice Phillips.A spokesperson for GNM said: “We welcome the court of appeal’s unanimous decision.“Our reporting on Mr Clarke in 2021 was based on the accounts of 20 brave women. After we published our first article, more women came forward.“At trial, 32 witnesses are set to testify against Mr Clarke under oath. We look forward to the judge hearing the evidence.”Clarke has been ordered by the high court to pay the legal costs of Lewis and the five other co-defendants, whose legal representatives attended January’s pre-trial review.Clarke has denied any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing. He said in November 2023: “I have always disputed the content of the eight Guardian articles.”Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianNational newspapersNewspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

Because you can go to Africa about one to two times a year, but you can go to America every week because you have 50 different states plus territories,” he said. “You can do four or five shows in New York … You can do upstate New York, you can do Manhattan, you can do Queens, you can do Brooklyn and you can do the Bronx. So it’s very important for any artist to have that access.”The US Virgin Islands governor, Albert Bryan Jr, said: “It was awesome to meet the man that livened plenty of dancehalls for me. Welcoming him to the Virgin Islands was a special pleasure, not only for the privilege of meeting him but the joy I know his music brings to people.”His attorney Bridgette Bennett – dubbed the “reggae visa lawyer” after winning a string of complex US immigration cases forJamaicanmusicians – said no clear reason was ever given for Beenie Man’s visa refusals.“A big part of my challenge was dissecting the situation and understanding why they were denying my client. There is a concept in immigration called ‘inadmissibility’ that is written into the Immigration and Nationality Act. So they will check off on a little piece of paper saying you are inadmissible under this section of the law. And sometimes … they will not give specifics, but just point to a general area of the law,” she said.View image in fullscreenBeenie Man performs during Yam Carnival 2021 at Clapham Common on 28 August 2021 in London, England.Photograph: Lorne Thomson/RedfernsThe US-based attorney, who originally got into immigration law when her then husband, a Jamaican entertainer, was facing deportation said her arguments had focused on touring artists’ economic value.“I usually make arguments on the economic benefits of having live performances. And I have lots of research showing that performers bring in jobs and billions of dollars. Their tours generate a lot of benefits for the US. I also talk about cultural enrichment,” she said.For Beenie Man, real name Moses Anthony Davis, the visa ban was just the latest hurdle among many he has encountered in his music career, which started when he was just seven years old.As a child, he had a severe stutter, but he discovered that it disappeared when he sang.“I never got into music. Music was born inside of me because when I was a kid I used to stutter, and music allowed me to be able to have this conversation with you now,” Beenie Man said.“I used to sing the reading book, I used to sing the shopping list on my way to the shop. Then I started to put two and two together and make some songs. So this music really gave me a voice so I can speak to people.”At seven Beenie Man won his first music contest, by eight he had put out his debut singleToo Fancyand at 10 he released his first album,The Invincible Beenie Man: The Ten Year Old DJ Wonder.An incident in 1991 might have torpedoed his career, when he performed a song about “green arm” – or smelly armpits – at an event honouring Nelson Mandela, who was visiting Jamaica.“I remember the day and time like it was today,” said Beenie Man, allowing that the choice was a mistake.“I sang the wrong song at the wrong time. And yeah I got booed. So I decided that that would never happen to me again. So from there on, I became the man that I am today. I just push forward, push forward, nonstop, just pushing forward right through.”The early days of Jamaican dancehall – in picturesRead moreBeenie Man, who has a Jamaican Order of Distinction for his contributions to music, said that a return to performance in the US was a chance to be a cultural ambassador for Jamaica, a country whose music is central to its identity.He said: “Without our culture, you have no country. Can you imagine if we stop talking about the Maroons who freed themselves from slavery? Can you imagine if we erase our iconic musicians and poets like [the poet and activist]Miss Lou, Bob Marley and Desmond Dekker – all of these great people who made the music what it is today? Can you imagine if we stop speaking about them and focus only on those promoting violence and ignorance?“We have to realise that we set the culture, and we preserve the culture. What we don’t want to do is to freak out the culture and make the youth become vultures. Proper music and proper performances. That means, dealing with people in the right way. So If you have to take a hundred pictures, you stand up and take 100 pictures. You can’t be too tired to take 100 pictures when you have 10,000 people pay to come to your show,” he added.Explore more on these topicsMusicJamaicaAmericasReggaefeaturesShareReuse this content"

With the exception of two numbers, settings of poems by Rückert and Schiller from the 1849 Lieder-Album für die Jugend, Op 79 which close their selection, tenorIan Bostridgeand pianistSaskia Giorgini’sdisc is devoted to songs that Schumann composed during that first extraordinary burst of lyrical creativity. They include one of the well-known song cycles, the Op 39 Liederkreis, to poems by Eichendorff, together with the 12 Kerner Lieder Op 35 (after the poet Justinus Kerner), and the much less familiar group of five songs on texts by Adelbert Chamisso that make up Schumann’s Op 40.View image in fullscreenArtwork for Twilight: Schumann Songs.Bostridge’s performances of all these songs have a wonderful clarity and sensitivity. He so obviously cares deeply about the texts and ensures that he delivers them with such vividness and clarity that there is not a syllable out of place. His tone has darkened over the years, and he uses those deeper shades to great effect in the more introspective numbers in the Liederkreis, just as effectively as he brightens his sound for the relatively lightweight lyrics of the Chamisso set. Occasionally his habit of inserting tiny crescendos into each note of a sustained line becomes a little obtrusive, but this is really an album full of treasures, and also the occasional discovery.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

In the pit, Martyn Brabbins is superbKeith BruceFri 21 Feb 2025 10.45 ESTLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2025 10.48 ESTShareCome June, Martyn Brabbins will be directing the orchestra of English National Opera in David Pountney’s new production of Tchaikovsky’s Mazeppa, a story of wartime Ukraine, at Grange Park in Surrey. Brabbins,who resigned his positionas music director of ENO in October 2023, has, however, chosen to make his first return to the pit with Scottish Opera, making his company debut with a score he had not previously studied, Janáček’s The Makropulos Affair.The result is a triumph, his immaculate pacing of the music and the sparkling detail in the playing crucial to the gripping storytelling of Olivia Fuchs’ production. With three striking sets for each of the three acts by Nicola Turner, beautifully lit by Robbie Butler, and video by Sam Sharples in the style of early 20th century experimental cinema,this staging was seen at WNO in Cardiff three years ago, but the Scottish premiere of this co-production, with a fresh cast, uses Pountney’s English translation of the libretto, sung so clearly that the surtitles are almost superfluous.At the heart of the compelling narrative is a riveting performance from Irish soprano Orla Boylan, following up her acclaimed Scottish Opera turn as Jenny Marx in Jonathan Dove’sMarx in London!Her chain-smoking, hipflask-toting opera diva, Emilia Marty, is uncaringly indestructible because an elixir has kept her alive since 1575 under various aliases, but always with the initials EM.Around her circle besotted men, company stalwarts Roland Wood as Baron Prus and Alasdair Elliot as Count Hauk-Šendorf and debuts from tenors Ryan Capozzo as Albert Gregor and Michael Lafferty as the Baron’s impressionable son Janek. Mark Le Brocq, as legal clerk Vítek, and Catriona Hewitson as his opera-singer daughter, Kristina, draw the audience into the tale with their characterful performances, and the young soprano is a crucial presence throughout, even in scenes where she has little to sing.Those include the introduction of a clever interlude between Act 1 and 2 that uses a recording of Janáček’s The Danube as part of the period meta-theatricality essential to both the opera itself and to this production. The combination of the wit of those ingredients, and some much broader humour, with the authority of the orchestral work, culminating in the achingly moving finale as Marty embraces death, is quite remarkable – and makes an unanswerable case for the century-old Makropulos as the most contemporary of Janáček’s operas.At Theatre Royal, Glasgow, on 22 February and Festival theatre, Edinburgh, on 27 February and 1 MarchExplore more on these topicsScottish OperaOperaClassical musicLeoš JanáčekreviewsShareReuse this content"

His recital at Bath Abbey on the recently refurbishedKlais organconstituted a starry opening to this year’sBachFest.Artistic director Amelia Freedman’s programming has always put music JS Bach himself would have known alongside that of the great man and, here, Latry played three works from earlier baroque composers who were pillars of the French classical organ tradition. Louis Marchand’s Grand Dialogue alternated grandeur with contemplative sections, with the lyrical flow of François Couperin’s Tierce en taille then offering a complete contrast.Bach so admired the music of Nicolas de Grigny that he transcribed his 1699 Premier livre d’orgue for his own use. Latry endowed the opening of De Grigny’s Hymn Ave Maris Stella with an arresting richness of colour, revelling in its glorious final chords by way of reminder that this music is central to his own heritage.Combining three of Bach’s many versions of the chorale Allein Gott in der Höh sei Ehr – equivalent to Gloria in Excelsis Deo – indicated a more cerebral approach: the elegant lines of BWV 663 were followed by the complex passagework of BWV 711, with the dramatic flourishes of the last, BWV 715, ending an unusual and inspired sequence. At the heart of the programme was Bach’s monumental Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 582, the cumulative effect of the variations – the light arpeggiated figuration sounding almost playful – powerfully realised.Console cameras and screens for the audience have transformed organ recitals and it was in the double fugue that seeing Latry’s feet dancing on the pedals, just as Bach’s did, added another dimension to the experience.As celebrated for his improvisatory genius as his virtuosity, Latry closed by extemporising on the name of BACH – transliterated as B flat, A, C, B natural – in homage. Indulging his imagination and exploiting the voicing of the Abbey instrument now created a vastly different soundworld, contemporary while yet occasionally recalling later French masters. His encore, an arrangement of Bach’s Prelude from the solo violin Partita in E major, BWV 1006, set the seal on a memorable evening.Bath BachFestcontinues until 22 February.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

A middle-aged daughter comes and goes. In between these last visits, there is remembered life. Celia Imrie as the mother andTamsin Greig as daughter give immense performances, their relationship abrasive yet loving.Imrieis the queenly, self-absorbed and peculiarly child-like Beth, who has an edge of Blanche DuBois. She is a nightmare mother, insisting on living with her daughter in university student digs and telling her all about her sex life. Greig breathes compassion into the stoic Bo,which is a challenging part to play: we see her across the ages, from the harried mid-life daughter of the present to a six-year-old learning to swim, a shouty 18-year-old, then later confiding in her mother about an abortion, a job as a scriptwriter, the adoption of her child.Anna Mackmin’s play is about the mother-daughter relationship as it crystallises in memory but seems obliquely to be a study of memory itself as well: how and what we remember, in what order.View image in fullscreenHarried … Tamsin Greig in Backstroke.Photograph: Johan PerssonScenes switch between the present to flashes of the past which sweep the women from the hospital to moments in their past – in no particular order, it seems. Also directed by Mackmin, the idea to enact the past as waves of memory is compelling but does not build to a bigger understanding of their relationship. The mother is dominating yet dependent, the daughter is unable to tear herself away. This dynamic does gain nuance in the second half of the show with shifts between them that are astutely observed and coming from a place of truth. But the non-chronological structure ends up obscuring its purpose rather than revealing it.Lez Brotherston’s layered set encompasses a large screen (video design by Gino Ricardo Green) as well as a hospital bed and a kitchen where the past is enacted. The screen carries melodrama with repeating scenes that sit oddly with the tone of the drama on stage.It only half-justifies itself in a swimming pool scene, late on, that earns the play its title and the metaphor of letting go (in life, in death). But it is both too literal, with flashes of Bo’s daughter, Skylar, and her partner, Ted, who are tangential to this story, or an abstract blur, with swirls and starling murmurations.And why are some scenes played off stage, where characters remain unseen? Their purpose remains unknown, too. The play cannot quite commit to its raw and edgy tone either – where most scenes are quietly cutting and emotionally complex, there are bursts of sentimentality (a cheesy swimming sequence by Beth and Bo on screen, set to music, and Bo’s eulogy in the final moments) which bristle uncomfortably against the rest of the play.Characters around the mother and daughter feel surplus because they are either too generic or barely there: a kindly hospital nurse is more convincing than the two-dimensionally hostile one. Skylar, who appears fleetingly, does little more than highlight Bo’s challenges as a mother.So an unruly and frustrating play but also original and moving, which captures sometimes searing pieces of mother-and-daughterhood.At theDonmar Warehouse, London, until 12 April.Explore more on these topicsTheatreTamsin GreigCelia ImrieDonmar WarehousereviewsShareReuse this content"

We have glimpsed them, fleetingly, as a perfect couple – surrounded by a chorus of friends on their wedding day. Five years on, Harry wants to live out her transgender identity and Jo just wants to escape.Chris Bush’s new play brims with humour and compassion. She describes it as “the most personal thing I’ve ever written” but this is not a mere “trans play” and for women it will be touchingly relatable. The ex-couple’s stories take us in diverging directions: we watch Harry navigating her new life, from bathroom politics and passport difficulties to her own mother’s microaggressions. Meanwhile, Jo heads to the Inca Trail like “Beyoncé in hiking boots” only to fall – literally – for Gabby, who wants to have children with her.From musical interludes and joyous clubbing choreography, the second half leaps into full-blown magical realism, a device that enables Bush to delve deeper into its protagonist’s embodied experiences. The success of the transition between the two styles is to the credit of director Ann Yee, flowing her cast around the circular pool that opens up in Fly Davis’s set.View image in fullscreenInstant chemistry … Amanda Wilkin and Jade Anouka.Photograph: Marc Brenner‘It is absolutely, fundamentally not autobiography’: Chris Bush on her new play about the trans experienceRead moreNot all the imagery is subtle however: Harry becomes a scaly sea creature and scientific freak, barred from the land by torch-wielding female elders. But the comparison between her changing anatomy and that of the pregnant Jo, with her slowing movements and shifting bones, are an effective projection of shared humanity.Performances underline the individual transformations. Jade Anouka’s Jo begins as an uncontainable, moving scribble of energy while the appearance of the brilliant Amanda Wilkin as Gabby brings an instant chemistry that really gets the production rolling. It’s a moving contrast to the quiet, understated yearning of Fizz Sinclair’s Harry, retreating from social and work appearances, and an all-too-fixed image on her Zoom calls home.Not all the sentiment will land for everyone and certain scenes can come across like empathy tests (when Harry is sexually harassed for the first time as a woman, she finds it “violating and validating”). But it is a powerful reminder of how theatre lets us live beyond our own bodies.At theAlmeida theatre, London, until 15 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreAlmeida theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Opening track4AM, with its muted, just-left-the-club vibe, doesn’t really call for such a full-throttle show, but the Irish alt-pop musician – AKA Jessica Smyth – is selling it as a floor-filler. “I know you don’t want to be alone,” she croons, her voice featherlight, pumping a fist in the air.It is a night of mixed messages. Biig Piig’s headline tour is in celebration of her long-awaited debut album11:11, but only a handful of those songs are scattered through a setlist that spans three EPs, a mixtape, and assorted other singles, and it severs the narrative thread connecting them.View image in fullscreenCommitted … Biig Piig.Photograph: Martin Grimes/Getty ImagesAcross that prolific, seven-year discography, Biig Piig has two modes: chilled-out, atmospheric songs influenced by trip-hop, R&B and jazz, and club-ready dance tracks with strobing synth and drum’n’bass drops. This evening, despite Smyth’s committed performance, she doesn’t find a balance between the two. Producer Mac Wetha’s warm-up set was high BPM bangers only, but Smyth takes the stage to thrumming, ambient sounds and spends the first 30 minutes of her own show trying to add unnecessary muscle to her quieter material.Her band – a bassist/saxophonist and drummer – add interesting detail to some of those songs; moodyRoses and Goldgets a great sax solo, and early trackPerdida’s introspective chorus – “I just wanna lay here, smoke my cig and drink my wine” – wins a gentle singalong. But the nuances of album trackOne Way Ticketgets lost in the mix, leaving an up-for-it crowd fidgeting.Smyth’s high-energy antics fall into place on a closing run of dance tracks. A wind machine is put to perfect use for new singlesFavourite Girl, with its kitschy handclaps, and the heated, swaggeringDecimal. She belts the chorus to 2020 hitSwitch, and it comes from the gut. “This record is about change, how we transform,” she told the crowd earlier; from this charismatic yet somewhat cautious show, it seems Biig Piig is still finding her final form.Biig Piig istouring the UKuntil 27 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

The recipient is his erstwhile best friend Pádraic (Colin Farrell). An easygoing man, Pádraic is generally acknowledged as a bit dull but a despairing Colm’s attempts to shun him turn surprisingly bloody. The civil war simmering away on the mainland is barely registered by the insular islanders, whose thwarted ambitions and dark secrets are given the weight of Greek tragedy by McDonagh. A superb cast also features Barry Keoghan and Kerry Condon.Saturday 22 February, 9.15pm, Channel 4ThelmaView image in fullscreenEasy rider … Richard Roundtree and June Squibb in a scene from Thelma.Photograph: APShifting smartly from delightful to distressing and back again,Josh Margolin’s debut feature centres on a spirited performance by June Squibb. She plays independent-minded 93-year-old grandmother Thelma, who is scammed out of $10,000 but then decides to hunt down the con artists herself. Co-opting the mobility scooter of her less gung-ho pal Ben (Richard Roundtree, in his final role), she pootles off across Los Angeles, raging against the dying of the light, in a comic paean to ageing on your own terms.Saturday 22 February, 10.10am, 8pm, Sky Cinema PremiereGodlandView image in fullscreenLong exposure … Elliott Crosset Hove in Godland.Hlynur Pálmason’s elemental period drama is a fascinating study in opposites. Coloniser v colonised, civilisation v nature, faith v human fallibility – these problems assail late 19th-century Danish priest and amateur photographer Lucas (Elliott Crosset Hove) as he treks across the big, bleak, beautiful landscape of Iceland one rainy summer to the site of his new church. His guide – and potential nemesis – is Ingvar Sigurdsson’s Ragnar, who resents the incomer but is drawn to his religion, though Lucas seems to care more for his camera than his flock.Saturday 22 February, 10.40pm, BBC FourCorsageView image in fullscreenUnlucky in glove… Vicky Krieps as Empress Elisabeth in Corsage.Photograph: Courtesy of Felix Vratny. /APWe’re in Vienna in 1877, and Empress Elisabeth of Austria (Vicky Krieps) is bored rigid.

But the itch to escape won’t be eased.Marie Kreutzer’s costume drama is a fabulous, cheekily anachronistic tale of female agency (or the lack of it) with the luminous Krieps a mesmerising presence.Monday 24 February, 11.20pm, Film4skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a drought persists, pastoralist tribes who migrate with their cattle across the Laikipia plateau come into conflict with commercial ranchers and wildlife reserve owners over grazing rights. The colonial history of land appropriation is the backdrop to increasingly entrenched attitudes, but a focus on individual farmers provides a valuable personal dimension.Tuesday 25 February, 10pm, BBC FourPretty Red DressView image in fullscreenStrong look … Natey Jones in Dionne Edwards’s film Pretty Red Dress.Questions of Black masculinity and gender identity are explored sensitively inDionne Edwards’s London-set film. Coming out of prison, Travis (Natey Jones) tries to settle back into domestic life with his partner, aspiring musical theatre actor Candice (an all-singing Alexandra Burke), and grumpy teenage daughter Kenisha (Temilola Olatunbosun). But when Candice gets the titular dress for her audition for a Tina Turner play, Travis can’t resist trying it on. However, roleplay masks a deeper need in him that begins to put stress on the family unit. A promising first feature from a film-maker to watch.Friday 28 February, 11.05pm, BBC TwoCold WarView image in fullscreenShades of grey … Paweł Pawlikowski’s romantic drama, Cold War.Photograph: Curzon Artifical EyeFocusing on a grand passion that is buffeted by the chilly realities of the Soviet era,Paweł Pawlikowski’s bittersweet drama traces a couple of decades in the relationship of Wiktor (Tomasz Kot), a composer at a Polish state-sanctioned folk ensemble, and one of his young singers, the ambitious, lively Zula (Joanna Kulig). Shot in crisp black-and-white, which gives the film a nostalgic, romantic feel – particularly in its Paris sections – the film asks what love is strong enough to persist across political divides and the stresses and strains of ordinary life.Friday 28 February, 2.15am, Film4Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe seven best films to watch on TV this weekDrama filmsThe Banshees of InisherinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Written by Jack Thorne and starring Jodie Whittaker, Aimee Lou Wood and Robert Carlyle, this bleak but stirring true story lands somewhere between Mr Bates vs the Post Office and Erin Brockovich. It centres on the redevelopment of a decommissioned steelworks, which foreshadowed a rise in children being born with upper limb disabilities. It’s a claustrophobic and ominous affair featuring the red dust of the steel plant billowing poisonously through the town, but Whittaker is superb as Susan McIntyre, the mother battling Corby council for justice and accountability.Netflix, from Thursday 27 FebruaryRunning PointView image in fullscreenSlam dunk … Kate Hudson as Isla Gordon in Running Point.Photograph: Katrina Marcinowski/Netflix © 2024Isla Gordon (Kate Hudson) is far from the golden child of her dysfunctional family – and that’s saying something. However, they also own the fictional, high-rolling basketball team the LA Waves – and when big brother Cam’s drug habit threatens to overwhelm him, Isla finds herself running the show, dealing with old-school sexism (“I guess it’s ‘take your sister to work day’,” quips one player), jealous siblings and sceptical sponsors. Running Point is breezy if generic sitcom fare; it is light bordering on slight but it’s easy to root for Gordon as her power-suited battle against the patriarchy begins.Netflix, from Thursday27 February1923View image in fullscreenCold comfort … Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren as troubled farm owners the Duttons in 1923.Photograph: Lo Smith/PA“Today, we begin making Montana a playground for the elite.” Developers are looking to carve up and sell off the US wilderness. This clearly isn’t great news for the Duttons, whose ranch is slap bang in the middle of this projected reservation for the rich. As theYellowstone prequelinches ever closer to the timeline of the original show, this existential threat is leading to reunification as Spencer begins the trek home to help his family. But first, there’s a brutal winter to survive. A grand spectacle, fondly leaning into the mythology around America’s turbulent past.Paramount+, from Sunday23 FebruaryThe BaldwinsView image in fullscreenSmart Alec? … Hilaria and Alec Baldwin in The Baldwins.Photograph: Discovery+There is, at the very least, a certain unease underpinning this glossy series offering a fly-on-the-wall view of the domestic life of Alec Baldwin.

This patient, gripping and accomplished thriller is set in a Welsh coastal town with a dark past. When a nurse is murdered, DS Rick Walters is tasked with finding her killer. However, instructions from higher up dictate that he’ll be joined by DI Ffion Lloyd – who, awkwardly, was once his fiance. Initially, it seems an open-and-shut case but soon evidence casts doubt on both the current investigation and a previous murder inquiry. Slowly but inexorably, Walters finds his sense of both his town and his marriage turned upside down.PHBBC iPlayer, from Tuesday 25 FebruaryAbbott ElementaryView image in fullscreenMaking the grade … Quinta Brunson as Janine Teagues in Abbott Elementary.Photograph: Gilles Mingasson/DisneyThemuch-loved US school sitcomreturns for a fourth season, and look out for a brave, arguably foolhardy gambit from blundering principal Ava Coleman, who has invited an HR investigation into issues surrounding governance. Cue a veritable avalanche of complaints about her. More seriously, there are new arrivals thanks to a nearby construction project – but nothing much in the way of new money. Abbott Elementary is starting to tread water a touch in terms of character development, but its quick wit and good nature keeps us coming back for more.Disney+, from Wednesday26 FebruaryDoubters to Believers: Liverpool FC – Klopp’s EraView image in fullscreen‘High emotional pitch’ … former Liverpool FC manager Jürgen Klopp.Photograph: James Baylis/AMA/Getty ImagesAll football clubs are prone to self-mythologising.

On top of the wonderful food, it proved excellent value.Matt Luntskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From Marrakech we drove through the High Atlas and Anti-Atlas mountains, stopping at our leisure to let the natural beauty of the surroundings and its people sink into our souls. We stayed in a beautiful and affordable casbah in the city of Ouarzazate. In the early evening of the first day of the festival we arrived and immersed ourselves in the music, the colours and the energy. A remarkable three-day celebration of nomadic life with the soundtrack of desert blues (a fusion of blues and rock from the Sahara). The performance of the headliner,Bombino, was a fitting climax to the whole unforgettable experience.Humberto PenaEasy, breezy walks in RabatView image in fullscreenRabat.Photograph: Laura Di Biase/AlamyRabat was the city break I didn’t know I needed. Often overlooked by tourists in favour of Marrakech or Fez, it offers a Moroccan experience that feels refreshingly unhurried. Wandering its medina, I was charmed by the warm greetings of locals, happy to help or simply let me browse their spices, leather and perfumes without the pressure I found elsewhere. Just steps away, the restless Atlantic Ocean provided a peaceful escape, with breezy walks along the shore clearing my mind. The city also has a sleek, modern tram system, making exploration effortless (and even offering free wifi). Visit before the secret gets out.ZoeHidden riads on a road tripView image in fullscreenEssaouira.Photograph: Francesco Riccardo Iacomino/Getty ImagesWe travelled around Morocco last year and were pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to get around by bus and train. We also booked accommodation as we went – hostels and riads. Some of the beautiful riads were tucked away down tiny alleyways; it seemed unbelievable that we’d ever find them. A great place wasAtlantic Hostelin Essaouira (£15 per person). It was friendly, simple and clean, and had the most wonderful rooftop terrace.

But don’t let that put you off; in fact, I found the jeopardy rather exciting.Stark by Ben and Sophie Crittenden is the latest reprise of the pair’s former12-seater in Broadstairs, Kent. The couple, seeking a better work/life balance, upped sticks here to the Côte d’Azur of Colchester, to open this brand-new Stark, which has slightly more covers (20 or so) and is, frankly, about as “independent” as a restaurant can get. We made the trek one Saturday evening, and were originally booked in for 6pm, until the Crittendens called to ask if we’d not prefer to eat later, because we’d be dining alone, a sweet attention to detail that only small operations such as this have time to pick up on (see alsothe Troublesome Lodgerin Marlow).Stark’s premises are delightfully homespun, and err on the side of a glorified timber gazebo. There is no reception desk or cloakroom, no art installations, wine cave, private dining mezzanine or other such frippery. And at the back of this prettified shed, chef Ben works solo as an army of one. No sous chef, chef de partie, patissier et al: just a man and his pans, serving six courses methodically. He used to work at Michelin-starredthe West Housein Kent and competed on MasterChef: The Professionals in 2014 before opening the Broadstairs incarnation of Stark, which itself quickly gained a Michelin star; just last week, this Mersea Island manifestation retained that star.View image in fullscreen‘Perfectly judged’: Stark’s cod with mussels and mushrooms.Expect the likes of pungent, earthy duck liver parfait served in a neat quenelle on a blob of rich onion marmalade, or a bowl of perfectly judged cod with mussels, or sea bass on a perch of caramelised fennel with a dainty prawn toast. Stark’s greeter, server, sommelier and occasional kitchen porter is Ben’s partner, Sophie, a calming, ebullient presence who you’d want on your side during a minor land battle. “Are you warm enough?” she asked as we settled in. Most restaurants in winter wouldn’t care if you ate in a bobble hat.The menu changes frequently, of course – you can do that when you’re a one-man band – and has in the past featuredshh’annu lambwith aubergine, and seared duck breast with apple and hazelnut. Some will cough that these dishes are more like mouthfuls, but even the most faff-phobic diner would find it hard to quibble with a sublime portion of medium-rare Scottish beef fillet on a rich jus with a single yet exemplary confit potato and a neat blob of whipped horseradish.A bowl of whipped goat’s curd appears towards the end of dinner – but is it pudding or another savoury course? Who can tell? It’s cheesy, certainly whiffy, with layers of thinly sliced grape, micro herbs, pistachio cake and chopped pistachio. It’s also quite unlike anything I’ve ever been served.View image in fullscreen‘Pungent and earthy’: Stark’s duck liver parfait.Crittenden makes fine produce the star of his show, then plates it up in curious, delicate, punchily flavoured pieces of art. There is a wine pairing for an extra £55 a head of French, Italian and Austrian wines. A grüner veltliner to match with the cod dish and a pale, sticky moscato to go with an artichoke and chocolate dessert. After a trying experience with an artichoke millefeuille, Charles has a vehement dislike of the annual winter “artichoke as pudding” season, but I adored this bowl of chocolate creme with candied artichoke, praline truffle and a scattering of chopped hazelnut. That was our final course of six, which we’d whistled through in about 90 minutes.The place was by this point full of Mersea Island’s great and good, many of whom were tackling the wine flight like troupers. “I bet the gossip that goes down in here is terrific,” I said to Charles.View image in fullscreen‘Dainty’: Stark’s sea bass with caramelised fennel and prawn toast.Stark is a gem. Some will scoff at its lack of airs and graces, at its minute team and at the fact that it’s a bit like eating in a summer house. But this very much feels like a restaurant opened on the Crittendens’ terms, in pursuit of that quasi-fantastical dream harboured by many hospitality veterans: how about if we opened a tiny place, and took away all those fussy, stressful bits of restaurateuring such as staffing, posh fit-outs and lengthy menus? Those things still feel necessary to climb ladders and grace fancy lists drawn up by tyre companies, but they can also turn a restaurant into a behemoth that gobbles up lives and turns the owner’s children into strangers. Stark is a lesson in simplicity. Check the tides, take an open mind and give it a go.StarkEast Road, East Mersea, near Colchester, Essex, 01206 616430 or starkmersea@gmail.com.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.At the start of this month, the new wine duty was fully implemented by our current government, having been introduced by the previous one. Cheers, guys. But what, exactly, has happened, and how have things now changed?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In August 2023, Rishi Sunak’s government introduced a revised alcohol duty in line with the retail price index (essentially a measure of inflation). While the system this replaced calculated wine duty by volume (with three different rates for still, sparkling and fortified wines), the new duty is calculated via a drink’s alcohol by volume. And because wine can now be labelled to within the closest 0.1% ABV, those three rates have now been replaced bywell over 100 different ones.Due to the complexity of the new system (yes, it all makes my brain hurt, too), a temporary easement period was introduced to help businesses get ready for the changes – for instance, wines between 11.5% and 14.5% were all taxed as if they were 12.5%. And that period is what ended on February 1, so welcome to the new normal.The duty rises mean that, as with pretty much anything else you can buy, prices are now steadily creeping up – the Wine and Spirits Trade Association estimated thatabout 43% of all wines would increase in price– with red wines, which tend to be higher in alcohol, the most affected, with the tax on a 14.5% bottle now up to £3.09.There are many issues with the new system, which fails to appreciate the complexities of wine as an agricultural product. In some cases, for instance, ABV cannot be accurately predicted due to increasingly unpredictable climatic influences from vintage to vintage, while many classified wines are subject to stylistic rules that mean their ABV cannot be lowered.And all this means that all those beautiful stories I’m used to being regaled with about reasonable prices for outstanding wines slip further and further into the past. It makes me wonder why I spent the 1990s learning basic motor skills when I could have been buying reasonably priced burgundy instead? It also means that prices will rise everywhere, so while I’ll continue to seek out great value, these universal price increases mean we should be even more wary of wines that remain hyper-cheap. After all, if fast fashion raises questions about ecological and social sustainability for you, so should any bottle of wine retailing for less than £5.Four inflation-friendly bottlesDomaine des Ormes Saumur Rouge£10.50 Co-op, 13%.

However, I’ve decided to break the rules and go in a different direction with a nutty, buttery filling that feels reminiscent of a florentine. I think these fit the bill for a good Sunday lunch pudding, too. Serve warm and still a little gooey with some cold cream.Honey nut galettesPrep10 minChill1 hr 20 minCook1 hr 15 minMakes4For the pastry180gplain flour,plus extra for dusting130g unsalted butter20g caster sugarSaltEgg wash2 tbspdemerara sugarCold cream,to serveFor the filling100g honey30g unsalted butter30g light brown sugar60ml double cream½ tsp flaky sea salt1 egg yolk10g plain flour100g toasted flaked almondsTo make the pastry, put the flour, butter, sugar and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Use your fingertips to rub in the butter until you have a coarse mixture with small, slightly uneven chunks of butter in it. Make a well in the centre, pour in 35-40ml cold water, then use a table knife to bring the mix together into a dough. Pat it into a disc, wrap in clingfilm and chill for at least an hour.For the filling, put the honey, butter, sugar, double cream and salt in a small saucepan, and heat gently until melted and smooth. Take off the heat and leave it to cool a little.Whisk in the egg yolk and flour, then tip in the flaked almonds, stirring to make sure everything is well coated.Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/400F/gas 6½. Cut the chilled pastry into four, then roll out each piece on a lightly floured surface into a disc about 5mm thick. Spoon some of the filling on top, leaving a border around the edge, and fold the edges of the pastry up and over the filling. Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling.Transfer the galettes to a lined baking tray and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes. Brush with egg wash, sprinkle with demerara sugar, then bake for 10 minutes. Turn down the oven temperature to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and bake for a further 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is browned. Serve warm with cold cream.Explore more on these topicsPastryThe sweet spotFoodDessertBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"
