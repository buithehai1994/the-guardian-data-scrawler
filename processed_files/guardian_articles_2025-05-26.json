What’s striking is that men in this new polling can’t see thatMon 26 May 2025 12.47 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 17.24 EDTShareAre you living in a pit of worry at work, frightened of getting fired for doing the tiniest thing wrong? Do you fear that your kids will be worse off than you? Have you ever suspected that you’ve been denied a promotion at work because of who you are, not what you can do?Well, join the club. Or maybe not, because this particular club was apparently founded for white men and white men only. “Millions of men are walking around on eggshells at work too scared to speak freely, while knowing that being male can now be a disaster for your career,”according to Tim Samuels, a former BBC documentary-maker turned presenter of a YouTube show called White Men Can’t Work!, which launches this week.Thefirst episodeincludes an interview with Chas Bayfield, a middle-aged advertising director whowon a sex discrimination claimover being made redundant after questioning what his female colleague’s vow to “obliterate” the firm’s white, privileged and male image meant for people like him. Work was, Bayfield explains on the show, the one thing in life he felt really good at and being let go was devastating: “My first thought was ashamed … I assumed I was bad at my job, that I’d suddenly become bad at my job, that I was not needed.”From the interview, which focuses on how men’s identities are often deeply bound up with work, it’s clear what a profound impact that injustice has had on him. What is rather less clear, however, is how one hard case becomes “millions” of men tiptoeing around the office in fear of their professional lives, suddenly realising what a disaster it is to be wearing the trousers, at a time when men still out-earn women by a measly7% on averageand the unemployment rate for black men ismore than twicethat of white men.Enter a poll specially commissioned for the show, which helpfully found that 41% of respondents were “often anxious that as a white man I can be sacked over doing or saying the wrong thing”, while 24% even felt their mental health had suffered “as a result of a diversity drive” at work.And yes, you are allowed to roll your eyes now, along with, I suspect, at least some of the 49% of white men who ticked a decisive, snorting “no” to that last question. Yet tempting as it is just to dump a giant bucket of cold water over the idea that poor white men are the official victims now and move on, something about the minority claiming real distress should set alarm bells ringing – if only about to whom exactly they’re talking and listening.It’s not just white men who spend their 50s watching anxiously over their shoulders, constantly wondering if they’re about to be replaced by someone cheaper and half their age, and how they’ll survive financially to retirement if that happens. But do enough middle-aged men have people in their lives they can confide in over what is secretly an almost universal fear? And if they don’t, who else is stoking their insecurities and channelling their indignation towards an easy target? (Noticeably, the conviction that the working world is out to get them was significantly stronger in Reform UK voters.) Do the younger white men Samuels says are feeling “very despondent about their futures” realise how many other twentysomethings feel exactly the same, and would it change anything if they did?It would be interesting to know, meanwhile, how the third of white men who worried their sons would have worse opportunities than they did feel about their daughters’ prospects. (For a good decade and a half now, polls have been consistently finding that parents of both sexes think the days of expecting your children to do better than you did are over.)The third of young white men convinced they’ve been passed over for promotion because of their identity, meanwhile, might genuinely benefit from comparing notes with the 53% of young womenwho told researchersfor the Young Women’s Trust that they think the same has happened to them. (One in three HR decision-makers sampled by the trust confessed to being aware of some form of discrimination against women in their organisations in the past year: they weren’t asked if they’d seen something similar happening to white men, but again it would be a fascinating question.)I don’t doubt that some of the anxiety Samuels identifies is real. There are enough badly managed companies around to make it plausible that some have handled diversity programmes as clumsily as they handle everything else. Working life feels tough right now, with redundancies looming and lucky breaks harder to come by, and it genuinelyismore stressful when you’re constantly having to second-guess yourself or worry about getting things right – as older women and minorities, who had to do exactly that for decades in order to fit in to male-dominated offices, of course know better than anyone.So if white men genuinely don’t think work is working for them, welcome to the club, boys. Just don’t forget that some of us have been here rather longer than you.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why text messages are the hot new boom area in TV showsWhat makes for a believable texting – or sexting – exchange? And why has this suddenly become so crucial for a character’s credibility? We meet the teams who agonise over writing lines that only appear on screen for secondsAmelia TaitMon 26 May 2025 10.49 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 11.49 EDTShareIn the final episode of Ted Lasso’s second season, Ted sends a text to his ex-wife that reads simply: “Knock, knock.” Nothing too unusual about that you might think, but whatisstrange is that it appears to be the very first message he’s ever sent the mother of his son. Stranger still, she has never previously texted him either. The blank white space above and below their messages reveals that the characters share zero messaging history.It’s a problem that used to plague TV. Why is the first message Emily in Paris has ever received from her boyfriend: “Hey, how is Paris?” When Rebecca accidentally sends a text to her crush instead of her best friend in Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, why is their history blank when we saw him text her about a housewarming party a few episodes earlier? In 2021, Wired journalist Zak Jason nameda whole litany of showsin which characters don’t have text histories – New Girl, Insecure, The Undoing – and argued that it was, “inexcusable, and unnerving to witness”.It appears that studios and streamers alike were listening. Because nowadays, television writers put a huge amount of thought into getting a character’s text history right – even if it is only going to appear on screen for a matter of seconds.We met with the writers, directors and showrunners to figure out what Ted Lasso would have said to his doctor three months agoIn the currently airing dark comedyYour Friends & Neighbours, everyone texts regularly. When Jon Hamm’s character Coop wants to meet up with his lover, we see a long history of past booty calls and even the bottom of a sexy snap. When his son texts his crush, it’s apparent that she previously responded to something with the letter “k”. Meanwhile, recently released thriller seriesThe Stolen Girlfeatures emoji-filled logs between spouses and colleagues: “Grabbing lunch. Want anything?”, “I’m WFH today btw.” And Ted Lasso course-corrected in season three,showing viewersTed’s historic interactions with swathes of people, including a message to his upstairs neighbour: “I swear to you, I’m not playing music.”View image in fullscreen‘I swear to you Mrs Shipley, I’m not playing music’ … Ted Lasso’s much-changed phone in season three.Photograph: Amelia Tait“It drives all of us crazy when there aren’t text histories – it’s something we’ve fought for years,” says Dave Henri, a managing partner of California-based graphic design firm Modern Motion, which he co-founded in 2009. The company developedMagic Phone, a piece of software that can be installed on prop devices on set. The app is paired with a Bluetooth keyboard that allows crew to trigger notifications, or the bubbles that appear when someone is typing, so an actor can tap out any old gibberish and still prompt the right message to appear on screen in real time. Magic Phone also enables productions to add text message histories with plausible time-stamps, and thanks to the realism of the software, it has been used by numerous Apple TV+ productions including The Morning Show, Shrinking and Ted Lasso.TV fans today are taking screen grabs, posting them on Reddit and dissecting everything“I think the studios and creatives have embraced the fact that we are so used to seeing these devices that, if it doesn’t look right, the audience bumps against that,” says Modern Motion co-founder Chris Cundey. Or as Henri puts it: “A lot of thought goes into it now because people are aware that fans are taking screen grabs, posting them on Reddit anddissecting everything.”Modern Motion employee Rob Rogers worked on Ted’s elaborate text history in season three; he says the graphics went through 25 to 30 iterations before they got it right. “We met with the writers, directors and all the showrunners to figure out what Ted would have said to his mum, or what he would’ve said to the doctor three months ago,” Rogers says. Some graphics were even altered after the show premiered, to improve them for people streaming later on. “If they realised a message couldn’t have been sent at 10:53am for whatever reason, they wanted to fix it to make it perfect.”View image in fullscreenScroll queen … Ambika Mod in The Stolen Girl.Photograph: Matt Squire/DisneyA surprising amount of work goes into something that is on screen for just a brief moment. “On just run-of-the-mill text messages, we would have 13 or 14 iterations. That comes down to thinking about what a character is named in a person’s phone, what their contact image is, or whether they know each other well enough to have an image,” says Rogers. In one throwaway gag for eagle-eyed viewers, we see that Ted’s mum has previously texted him to say that her internet is down, before attaching a picture of an unplugged router. “We had like three or four different photos that they provided of that router – that’s how deep we go.”While it’s fun to add Easter eggs like this, past texts can’t be too distracting because then audiences will miss the “hero text” that is being sent or received as part of the plot. Script editor Charlie Niel battled with this on The Stolen Girl. While texts that were important for the storyline were written into the script by the head writers, he filled in the message histories, which were then signed off by the writers and producers. “The crucial, crucial thing is not pulling focus,” he says. Past texts can’t be “outlandish, attention-grabbing or long” because viewers’ eyes will drift up. “On the other hand, it’s a tricky balance because I also find it distracting if the messages are too generic; if they’re how no one ever speaks.”Niel looked to his own real-life texts for inspiration. “I would think, ‘What do I text my colleagues about?’ And it’s stuff like, ‘I’m going out for coffee, do you want one?’” Sometimes he would throw in a typo to make things realistic. But he also had to be careful not to include anything that would inadvertently affect the story or change the way we see the characters. Continuity was king – if a character gets a text on one day, it needs to be visible in their history the next day – sometimes with a few random other messages in between.View image in fullscreenA booty call in Your Friends & Neighbours.Photograph: Amelia TaitIn the end, Niel wrote between 10 and 20 historic texts for each interaction, for only one or two of them to ultimately end up on screen. At one point in The Stolen Girl, a character scrolls through the DMs sent to a media outlet’s social media account and Niel had to “adopt the voice of an internet troll” to write these messages. He also had to come up with the senders’ names. Because every name that appears on screen has to besigned offby the legal department – so that, for example, a journalist named Amelia Tait couldn’t sue if a journalist named Amelia Tait were featured – Niel christened some of the trolls after fellow crew members.In the end, text message histories won’t make or break a show, but they are often appreciated by audiences. “Because TV viewers are so sophisticated now, they’ll notice if one little text that we say happened on 26 April contradicts something else in the script,” Niel says. Actors, too, often enjoy playing around on their phoney devices. “Making it easy for the actors, and seeing their reaction to it, is really one of the best things,” Henri says. Apparently Harrison Ford was a fan of Magic Phone on the Shrinking set. And Cundey notes that even actors who “hunt and peck with just two fingers” while typing can look like master hackers thanks to the software.Nowadays, if characters’ text histories are missing, viewers can be a little more confident that it just might be on purpose. “When a typing bubble appears and goes away and appears and goes away and nothing comes, that’s a modern metaphor for something unresolved,” Cundey notes – texts can communicate so much with so little. And the crew behind these messages are happy that their work is starting to get noticed. “We are an often misunderstood or passed over vocation of the industry,” says Rogers. “But we’re also ever-growing.” Or to put it another way: ppl don’t say omg atm, but iykyk.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTelevision industryEmily in ParisMobile phonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At Brixham market, where most of the catch is sold, tens of tonnes of octopus is being traded every day. Octopus fever has taken over the town; Octavia the octopus, a cephalopod-shaped light usually switched on at Christmas, is being turned on every night; while a nearby cafe has decorated itself with an octopus mural.View image in fullscreenBrixham fish market in Devon is witnessing a rare glut of octopuses drawn away from the waters of Morocco and Mauritania.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianBarry Young, the managing director of Brixham Trawler Agents, said 36 tonnes of octopus came through the market on Thursday – compared with about 200kg this time last year.“It’s a financial bonus for the fishermen,” Young said. “They’re grabbing it with two hands while they can. The boats, they fish for certain species, we fish for ‘bottom fish’, which is called a demersal species. We would catch plaice, dover sole, brills, turbots, anything sort of bottom-dwelling.“Luckily for us and the fleet that we deal with, the octopus seems to be a bottom-dwelling fish as well.”Ian Perkes, who has owned a fish merchant in Brixham harbour for 49 years, said it was the first time in his career he had seen the giant molluscs.“It’s down to climate change because it’s only this year that they’ve been here,” he said. “We’ve not seen them before, this time last year, they were on the French side of the water and the French were filling up with them.”Perkes said octopuses were normally caught off the coast of Morocco and Mauritania, where it is a “massive, massive business” but they have been coming north as the water off the coast of England was much warmer.The surge in octopus numbers has been a bonus for English fishing because there is no quota and a big market, especially in Spain, fetching £8 a kilogram at auction. The 22-tonne catch brought in on Tuesday would be worth about £170,000, Perkes explains. Approximately 70-80% of the fish and seafood caught is sold abroad.“They’re a shot in the arm for the fishermen, like a massive bonus, because there’s no quota. They’re making incredibly good money,” Perkes said, adding that the octopuses were being swept up across the industry.“They’re getting caught in all methods of fishing,” he said. “Caught in cuttlefish pots, in crab pots by trawlers, by the beamers. The seabed is full of them.”The flip side to the boom in the UK is that the industry is struggling in Spain, where many companies have processing facilities and employ hundreds of people in Morocco and Mauritania.And not everyone in the UK industry is pleased. There was some tension among fishers specialising in crab and lobster when they discovered the octopuses entering the pots and eating the shellfish inside.The octopus – which has nine brains and three hearts – uses its beak to break the crab or lobster shell. It then injects enzymes that help dissolve the meat before sucking it out.“Some of the boats have seen that, where the octopuses are prolific in certain areas, they have seen a dramatic drop off in crab and lobster,” Young said.The Devon and Severn Inshore Fisheries andConservationAuthority (D&S IFCA) enforce a bylaw requiring “escape gaps” to be fitted to crab and lobster pots to enable undersized shellfish to escape – a conservation measure to protect juvenile crabs and lobsters and allow them to escape.It is through these escape hatches that the fishers believe the octopuses are entering and leaving after they have eaten the creatures within. The D&S IFCA said the holes could be closed if fishers were trying to catch octopuses only, and it was working on trying to find a long-term solution.Marine biologists said the spike in marine temperatures this spring was unprecedented. It began in early March and is continuing into the end of May.As human-induced climate breakdown continues to raise global temperatures, the frequency of marine heatwaves is increasing, with the UK being subjected to spikes in sea temperature more frequently.The hidden cost of your supermarket sea bassRead moreAccording to Dr Marta Marcos, at the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies in Mallorca, Spain, who led a study into marine heatwaves, half of the sea warming since 2000 would not have happened without global heating.Carli Cocciardi, a marine nature recovery officer at DevonWildlifeTrust, said there had been a surge in octopuses in English waters recorded in the 1900s, the 1950s and briefly in 2022.“We’re unsure why this surge is happening,” she said. “But the main reason seems to be warmer waters, so climate change, a sea temperature rise. It could be also changes in prey availability or ocean currents.”Cocciardi said they were medium to large octopuses that could grow up to 1.3 metres in length and were “very intelligent animals”.She said there was no quota and as it was a new phenomenon it was uncertain what would happen in terms of management. But she added the authorities would “make sure it was sustainable” if it became a permanent feature in English waters.“We’re just going to have to keep an eye on it,” she said.Explore more on these topicsFishingFishConservationMarine lifeWildlifeFishing industryClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are very few successful shows on the BBC – with whom he spent his entire career – which did not bear his influence as producer, commissioner or presenter. They range through high culture to showbiz, from the Arena and Imagine arts documentaries to the more demotic Noel’s House Party, Strictly Come Dancing, Holby City and Ballykissangel, taking in Have I Got News for You, Bake Off and Absolutely Fabulous on the way.It was a formidable track record, leading to a series of executive positions within the corporation, which almost inevitably created critics at the BBC and, more poisonously, the conservative press. Its continuous denigration of him and through him the larger target of the BBC itself, ultimately contributed tohis resignationfollowing his outside chairmanship of theKids Company charity, which collapsed in a welter of debt in 2015.A famously disorganised figure, more concerned with programme ideas than administration, always on the lookout to cultivate and befriend the powerful, and seemingly with a kind of grandiosity, he was easy to mock.Liz Forgan, the former chair of the Scott Trust, owners of the Guardian, who worked with Yentob at the BBC,told the paper in 2016: “He is ludicrously vain ... is unbelievably snobbish and lives a life which is completely inappropriate and silly. You ask yourself does he deliver value sufficiently to justify all the nonsenses? And yes he does, you know, by miles.”View image in fullscreenAlan Yentob, left, on stage with the Dalai Lama at the Glastonbury festival in 2015.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesMore insidiously, his friend the novelistHanif Kureishinoted in the same article: “A posh Jew poncing around at the public expense: what’s not to hate?” In fact, the supposed extravagance, on examination showed Yentob underclaimed on expenses. There were dark tinges in the mock reversal of his name to Botney, first in Private Eye, then within the BBC, where he was also parodied by some as the Oily Levantine.“I always looked as if I was having too much fun,”he told the Guardianin 2016. “It is very good I said that because it’s true. But they have certainly done their fucking best to make it feel as bad as possible.” No one ever doubted Yentob’s devotion to the arts however, or to public service broadcasting by the BBC.The son of Iraqi-Jewish parents, Alan was born with his twin brother Robert in Stepney, eastLondon, to Flora (nee Khazam) and Isaac, known as Kay, Yentob, a former drinks salesman who worked for his brother-in-law’s textile business and moved his family to Didsbury, in Manchester. They moved back south again a decade later, to an apartment on Park Lane.View image in fullscreenAlan Yentob, right, with Russell T Davies. The documentary Imagine … Russell T Davies: The Doctor and Me was first aired in 2023.Photograph: Tanya Hudson/BBC StudiosThe sons were sent as boarders to the King’s school, Ely. Alan spent a year at Grenoble University before taking a law degree at Leeds University and, on graduation in 1968 was the only non-Oxbridge entrant to that year’sBBCtraineeship scheme.His ascent through the ranks as a producer was rapid: from World Service radio at Bush House to a producer and director on television arts features. On the flagship series Omnibus he made his name in 1975 with a documentary onDavid Bowiecalled Cracked Actor. It was the first time the BBC had devoted an entire programme to a pop star, and it wasrebroadcast in the Imagine series in 2013.A hallmark of Yentob’s approach to programmes was his embrace of a wide definition of culture. His meticulous approach to production values, working laboriously through the night on films, sleeping in his office, making his ideas work, emphasised his commitment.He was also prepared, as he gained influence and status within the department, to commission whole programmes on one personality or art form: a three-hourfilm on Orson Welleswas one such in 1982, a live broadcast of Verdi’s opera Stiffelio from Covent Garden in 1993 was another. There were also separate programmes such as an interview with the playwright Arthur Miller and a paean to the Ford Cortina.View image in fullscreenAlan Yentob with the children’s writer Judith Kerr.Photograph: Christian Czako/BBCInevitably the stars became friends – Mel Brooks and his wifeAnne Bancroft were godparents to his children – and the old arts magazine format embracing portmanteau subjects faded away.There were costume dramas he commissioned too: Pride and Prejudice (1995) was one, Life on Mars (2006-07) another, and in 2002 there was a whole new channel: CBeebies.The award-winning success of such programmes – Baftas three years running (1982-84) for the Arena documentaries of which he was editor, programming supremo of the year at the Broadcast Production Awards in 1997 – was accompanied by progress up the Corporation ladder: head of music and arts (1985-88), controller of BBC Two (1988-93), BBC One (1993-96), director of programmes (1996-97), director of television (1997-2000), director of drama, entertainment and children’s programmes (2000-04) and creative director (2004-15), in charge of 2,000 people and an annual budget of £500m.The only promotion he lacked was director general – he was too disorganised for that. Increasingly instead he appeared in front of the camera as a presenter and interviewer, creating his public profile. This all made him a hugely powerful figure within the BBC and broadcasting generally, shaping and personalising television’s evolving approach to the arts.He could undoubtedly have made more money elsewhere, in commercial broadcasting or in the US, but he chose to stay within the corporation, very well remunerated but not stratospherically paid.Then came the Kids Company affair. Yentob first became involved in 1997 with the organisation helping deprived inner-city children in London, run by the charismatic psychotherapistCamila Batmanghelidjh. It was the artistic work the charity was doing with the children that appealed to him, and he became chair of trustees from 2003 as it expanded exponentially before collapsing in 2015 as funding was reduced. It had had regular cash crises before the government pulled the plug on its support.A parliamentary inquiry asserted that the charity had been run onwishful thinking: Yentob responded that it was not “boxtickable”–“it was not run like other places, so you had to believe in it.” Critics said that his involvement was similar to the way he ran arts at the BBC: celebrity supporters and heedless use of funding.The tabloid press, which had previously lionised Batmanghelidjh, turned on the organisation and on Yentob personally. It did not help that the BBC was negotiating the renewal of its charter at the time.Anthony Wall, Arena’s editor, told the Guardian later: “I am not saying Alan hasn’t pissed people off over the years, but there was something else going on as well. There are people who are going to profit hugely from the destruction of the BBC.” Yentob had made himself an easy target.He was accused of paying insufficient regard to the running of the charity and also, within the BBC, ofpressurising colleagues at Newsnightto downplay its problems. He appeared outside the Today programme office as Batmanghelidjh was being interviewed, and it was these incidents that ultimatelyled to his resignationin December 2015. Yentob was subsequently cleared of the charges following an investigation by the BBC Trust and also later of overseeing maladministration at the charity.View image in fullscreenCamila Batmanghelidjh, left, and Alan Yentob giving evidence to the House of Commons public administration committee in 2015.Photograph: PAHe may have been off-staff but he did not cease to work for the BBC, presenting and producing documentaries for the Imagine series from 2003 up to the end of his life. Last year he was appointed CBE. Among his other involvements was the board of directors of Riverside Studios, the British Film Institute production board and chairmanship of the Institute of Contemporary Arts (2002-10).Yentob’s partner for 40 years was the documentary producer Philippa Walker, with whom he had two children, Jacob and Bella. The couple married in 2020. She and their children survive him.Alan Yentob, broadcaster and television executive, born 11 March 1947; died 24 May 2025Explore more on these topicsAlan YentobTelevisionBBCKids CompanyLondonBBC World ServiceDocumentaryobituariesShareReuse this content"

A video posted by an eyewitness shows a frightened man carrying a young child on his back as they run through the darkness, warning people away, before the roar of a jet and the white flash of a blast.Local people quickly circulated notifications of funerals for the many killed in the airstrike on the outlying Thaqban neighbourhood, listing the whole families that had died in an instant.This included Ali Yahya Salah Masoud, who one mourner said on social media was killed “hand in hand with his entire family, including his wife, sons and daughters”, alongside pictures from a long-ago celebration showing his daughters with red bows in their hair and his smiling sons in small suit jackets.Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesperson,said in late April that a punishing campaign of US airstrikes that began in mid-March had “hit over 1,000 targets, killing Houthi fighters and leaders … and degrading their capabilities”.Why are they bombing? The missiles are worth more than the buildings they’re hittingMohamed AlthaibaniWhile the US claims to have targeted the Houthis, the intense wave of airstrikes on major cities and sites across Yemen has also claimed dozens of civilian lives, according to human rights groups and the London-based monitoringorganisation AirWars, which lists fatalities from three families in the attack on the Thaqban district.“There’s nothing in this world, no matter how precious, that can replace my family,” said a 27-year-old mother of three, who said her parents and sisters were killed in the airstrike. “I feel like I die a hundred times a day from the grief.”“We buried eight people from a single family, from a single house,” said a mourner at the funeral procession. “There’s no sign that this was a military target. We’re their neighbours … we saw what happened.”Airwars cites several social media accounts which postedallegations that Yemen’s Houthi rebels used the Thaqban neighbourhood, including one Yemeni activist who posted on X that a home there contained a missile launch pad. All the posts were later deleted, and observers suggested that US forces had used the tweets to source information about where to target.View image in fullscreenA Houthi fighter amid the debris of a building reportedly destroyed by a US airstrike in Sana’a in April.Photograph: undefined/APAn official with US Central Command (Centcom), which oversees American military operations in Yemen, declined to comment on the airstrike on Thaqban, but said they were “aware of the claims of civilian casualties related to the US strikes in Yemen, and we take those claims very seriously. We are currently conducting our battle-damage assessment and inquiry into those claims.”In a statement last month, Centcom also released figures different from Parnell’s, saying US forces had struck more than 800 targets, killing “hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders”, including senior drone and missile operatives, while also destroying swaths of the group’s facilities, air defences, weapons-manufacturing facilities and missiles.It added: “These operations have been executed using detailed and comprehensive intelligence ensuring lethal effects against the Houthis while minimising risk to civilians.”As waves of American airstrikes pounded the Yemeni capital, Mohamed Althaibani watched the walls of his house shake. The bombs that pummelled sites on the outskirts have often hit sites that the US, and before them a coalition led by neighbouring Saudi Arabia, has already struck repeatedly over their decade-long military campaign, he said.“People here in Yemen are born into nothing, the government has nothing – so why are they bombing?” he asked. “There is nothing left to bomb. The missiles are worth more than the buildings they’re hitting.”They claimed to bomb the power plant but it wasn’t working anyway. We’re already relying on generatorsMohamed AlthaibaniTo the 72-year-old naturalised US citizen, the airstrikes were a grim reminder that the country he has lived in for four decades views civilian life in his home country as expendable.Then early this month, a fresh wave of Israeli strikes targeted the airport and a power station in Sana’a, hitting civilian infrastructure and residential areas.“Many people have died – and for what? There is nothing to strike here, except people trying to live, looking for food.“We have nothing. They claimed to bomb the power plant but it wasn’t working anyway. We’re already relying on generators,” said Althaibani.Photos from late Aprilshowed the mangled wreck of a car and people gathered around a large crater in the Farwah market in Sana’a after just one of the airstrikes, which the Houthis claimed killed 12 people and wounded 34 others.For people across Yemen, the airstrikes are a deadly addition to a humanitarian crisis that has overwhelmed the country for more than a decade. Civilians across the country have weathered a bloody civil war as Houthi rebels battled and eventually overwhelmed government forces in the capital, followed by a decade-long campaign of airstrikes and a naval blockade from a military coalition spearheaded by Saudi Arabia.At least 4.5 million people in Yemen are displacedby the fighting, the UN estimates, while 17 million people are in desperate need of food, including 5 million living on the brink of famine. A decision by the Trump administration to slash the US contribution to aid, particularly at the UN, has left humanitarians fearful that the cuts will further endanger civilian lives in Yemen.Althaibani describes being swarmed by desperate people each time he leaves the house, with most unable to afford food at the local markets, where even basic goods have become increasingly expensive.View image in fullscreenFires at the Bajil cement factory in Hodeidah, Yemen, after Israeli airstrikes targeted the Houthi-controlled port.Photograph: Getty Images“If I buy imported milk, that can be $6-7 (£5); a lot of people can’t afford that,” he said. “Only people with money can afford these kinds of things; the others are just trying to subsist on bread.”It was the strike on the Farwah market that made Althaibani weigh whether to leave Sana’a and return home to New York following months of pressure from his family to escape the bombings. Although the airport reopened this week after the Israeli strike earlier this month, he fears it could easily be a target again.“We used to say to one another, ‘if God loves you, he will send you to America’,” he said, expressing a deep love for the place he has called home, set up businesses and raised a family, but which recently unleashed the deadliest bombing campaign on Yemen in years.“I feel bad because they bombed my country, but America is my country too,” he said.Another US strike on the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea coast in mid-April marked one of the single deadliest since Washington drastically escalated its air campaign in Yemen weeks after Donald Trump took office. The family of a 48-year-old truck driver, Nabil Yahya, said he was killed when the fuel tanker he was driving burst into flames after the airstrike on the port.“That truck was all he had,” said Nabil’s younger brother, Sultan Yahya. “It was his only source of income.”View image in fullscreenThe Houthi’s attack in the Red Sea on the Chios Lion last year.

Israel has struck Yemen repeatedly in the past 18 months, in response to Houthi rocket attacks on Tel Aviv, while the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,threatened further airstrikes on Yemenearlier this month even without US support.“Israel will defend itself by itself. We are doing this in Yemen, we are doing this in other places, at great distances. We have harshly struck the Houthis in Yemen, and we still have not had the last word,” he said in a speech earlier this week.Abdullah Sabri, Yemen’s ambassador to Syria during the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad, who was an ally of Iran and the Houthis in Yemen, said US forces had “largely spared the Houthi leadership and military assets,” and instead accused them of targeting civilians and basic infrastructure.View image in fullscreenHouthi fighters pass a digital billboard featuring Donald Trump during an anti-US and anti-Israel protest in Sana’a this month.Photograph: Yahya Arhab/EPA“Washington is spinning a diplomatic defeat as a success,” he added.Analysts such as Maysaa Shujaa Aldeen,writing for the European Council on Foreign Relations, agreed. While the intense US air campaign initially appeared successful, she said, it had “not delivered broader strategic gains: despite the pounding, the Houthis still managed to attack US targets and Israel. Commercial shipping has not meaningfully resumed.“Moreover, the campaign has allowed the Houthis to tighten their grip domestically and they now celebrate the US stand-down as a sign of victory,” she said.The world is missing out on the real Yemen: we are not just war, headlines or suffering |  Nada Al-SaqafRead moreWhile Trump halted American military campaign, the US treasury department has continued to impose waves of sanctions, including on Yemeni banks, in an effort to curb funds flowing to the Houthis and “stop Iran-backed Houthi attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea”.The sanctions on key banks in Sana’a have left many inside Yemen panicking, said Radhya al-Mutawakel, of the human rights organisationMwatana. “We don’t know if this will eventually affect all banks. Our organisation transferred our money to another bank, but that could be designated at any time,” she said.“It’s not only direct attacks where civilians are killed, injured and civilian infrastructure destroyed, but daily life, especially at an economic level, is under attack,” she said. “People are just eager to live, they want all of this to stop.”View image in fullscreenA survivor of a US airstrike in Yemen’s Saada province last month. The Houthis said the site was holding African migrants.Photograph: Mohammed Hamoud/Houthi Media Center/GettyMurad Ahmed, who works at the port of al-Hudaydah, said the ceasefire agreement between Washington and the Houthis had provided some relief despite fears of future airstrikes. Recent US sanctions also targeted oil tankers delivering fuel to ports including Hudaydah, whichWashington claims is under Houthi control, allowing the group to benefit from selling fuel at inflated black market prices.“After the bombings and fuel blockades, we faced serious crises. Prices were rising to a dangerous point. But two tankers have now been allowed to offload fuel, and conditions are slowly improving,” Ahmed said.Althaibani said civilians remain caught between the ongoing Israeli bombing campaign, US sanctions and the Houthis, with most unable to do more than shelter in their homes when they hear the sound of bombardments.“They could target the Houthis if they wanted to, but why are they bombing cities if they don’t want to kill civilians?” he said. “They bombed all over the city and people were scared to flee in case they strike those areas. They decided to die in their homes. There is nothing they can do.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentYemenConflict and armsUS foreign policyIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

So a researcher in the Gaelic department came up with Balamory’Interviews byRich PelleyMon 26 May 2025 10.08 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 16.55 EDTShareBrian Jameson, creatorAfter graduating from Rada I’d been a jobbing actor for 20 years. One day I was with my kids watchingPlay School, and thought: “I could be a presenter on this.” So I became one, and then the BBC trained me up as a preschool director and I went on to be a freelance director and producer specialising in preschool.The BBC wanted to do a preschool drama centred around travellers in Ireland. It didn’t get commissioned but it gave me the idea to create something set in a community. I had a health hiccup, which put me out of work but gave me downtime to think. Play School had been a new programme every day, so it had an immediacy. I thought: “Why not make a preschool soap?”A year later, BBC had createdCBeebiesand had masses of airtime to fill and were looking for a programme that was about the world around us, so I pitched my idea. The commissioning editor said: “How can you do a soap for preschool kids?” I said: “Well, instead of the Queen Vic you could have a nursery school.” He said: “That’s quite a good idea.” I was made series producer and we had to film 126 episodes in 10 months, beginning in January 2002.I went down to the EastEnders set. They were very helpful and I came back with a formula. We were originally going to film in Kirkcudbright but that was too far from Glasgow, where we needed to film some of the indoor shots, so we moved it to Tobermory on the Isle of Mull, which is a child’s dream with all its colours, water and hills. I’d already written the theme song: What’s the Story in Tobermory? But there was a Womble calledTobermory, so a researcher in the Gaelic department came up with Balamory. It wasn’t a nod to Oasis’s (What’s the Story?) Morning Glory, which I’d never heard of!We put out feelers for the cast, such as “a child’s dream nursery teacher” for Miss Hoolie. Lionel Jefferies, who’d played the grandfather in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, applied, but we weren’t really looking for named actors, plus – it’s terrible to say – I think I was too terrified to audition him in case I had to say no. Mary Riggans, who’d been in Scottish soap opera Take the High Road, wowed us, and we cast her as Suzie Sweet. We constructed our own school in Barmulloch, in the north of Glasgow. The kids would come in and believe it was their nursery, so they didn’t have to act.Kids programmes aren’t just for children. They’re meant to be a shared experience. The characters we created all had their quirks. There was friction between [school bus driver] Edie McCredie and Suzie Sweet [who runs the village shop and cafe]. Miss Hoolie [nursery teacher] and PC Plum quite liked each other. I think the quirks made them seem more relatable. We created a community on this little island that felt realistic and had humour no matter what age you are. I think that’s probably why people are so fond of the characters and the place.I’m not involved in thereboot, at least, not yet.Kim Tserkezie, played Penny PocketI was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy at the age of two. It was amazing how many people thought my wheelchair was a prop. A small role in ITV drama Blind Ambition that centred on disabled athletes gave me the itch to act, although being disabled often means playing a character who specifically has a disability issue or medical problem. Eventually I found myself in a room with Brian Jameson and lots of other actors who were all being considered for the role of Penny. My disability was never openly discussed in front of me, which is what made the role so very important to me.Penny runs the village shop and cafe with Suzie Sweet. She’s a bit of a maths wizard and likes organising. As the writers got to know me and realise how active I was, Penny went on to be the football and rowing coach. I spent the best part of three years filming up inScotland, doing 14-hour days but having the best of times.Working on Balamory was such joy. I was surrounded by such a brilliant cast and crew. We laughed a lot! The scripts were funny but also sometimes surreal, like one about a party at the nursery when Penny and Suzie were dressed as Pearly Queens but nobody else was in costume. It was also emotional – I particularly remember the episode when Penny and Suzie went to Finland to visit Santa. I got to meet him and cuddle a litter of husky puppies – there were sobs!The Balamory fandom quickly grew. We were able to meet many of them when we performed live on the arena tours. It all felt a bit rock’n’roll. I remember Sophie Ellis-Bextor coming to the show and saying she loved Penny’srap song. For the first time my son started to think I was cool. I started to realise how popular the show had become when I went to St James’ Park to watch Newcastle United play and the fans, in their thousands, all sang What’s the Story? when they saw me. It gave me goosebumps, and still does, thinking about it.Explore more on these topicsChildren's TVHow we madeCBeebiesScotlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In addition, 20 patients were treated at the scene near Water Street. Four children were injured in total.ACC Jenny Sims, with Merseyside police, said the incident is not being treated as terrorism and they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.The prime minister said the scenes were “appalling”, while Liverpool FC offered its “thoughts and prayers” to those affected by the incident.Footage showed police cordons in place around the heavily littered road, with a large police presence, ambulances and a fire engine also at the scene.Map of Liverpool.Upsetting images captured a person being taken away on a stretcher and a man walking with his arm around a police officer for support.It is understood that approximately 30 people were treated for injuries or shock in an Italian restaurant opposite Liverpool town hall, around the corner from the scene of the collision.Les Winsper, 55, who witnessed the incident, said: “People started banging on the [car] windows. Then they smashed the windows and he’s panicked and put his foot down. He then hit someone and that person has gone in the air and he’s ploughed through the rest of them. I’ve never seen anything like it.”He added the first victim was thrown “about 20 feet” in the air by the collision.Winsper’s friend, Craig Steward, 52, said there was “chaos” with “people crying, children crying, shaking”.He added: “I personally think he’s hit someone by mistake and then he’s put his foot down. It was the worst thing I’ve seen in my life, you see it on TV. That’s why all the kids are crying, because they witnessed it. I’m traumatised.”Both men said the incident lasted 20 to 30 seconds.St John ambulance workers were among the first at Water Street to treat those injured, some of whom are believed to be in a critical condition. A reporter at the scene saw two “distressed” volunteer medics being comforted by colleagues as they made their way from the scene.Outside the police cordon, Sonny Singh, 40, said he saw an injured teenager and dozens of people run past him “crying and angry” shortly after the collision.“People were running, screaming … I saw a boy, probably about 15, holding his leg and bleeding. There were loads of people there,” he said, adding that he had heard the vehicle hit dozens of fans.Singh, from Leicester, had been celebrating with his two sons, aged nine and 13.View image in fullscreenPolice and emergency personnel on Water Street, Liverpool on Monday 26 May.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAMatt Cole, a BBC reporter who attended the parade with his family, witnessed the incident. He told BBC News: “There were screams ahead of us and suddenly this dark blue car just came through the crowd. It just wasn’t stopping. I managed to grab my daughter who was with me and jump out of the way.“It missed myself and my family by literally inches. We then turned and watched what happened momentarily behind us before running.“It was being chased by a group of men who were trying to bang on the side of it and throw things at it. The back of the rear windshield had been completely smashed in, but it just had no intention of stopping.”He added: “An entire squad of armed police cars stopped, and people jumped out with rifles and again big medical packs on and began running to the scene of the incident.”One eyewitness said the vehicle reversed before “what seemed like an incredibly deliberate” acceleration into a crowd of people on Water Street.View image in fullscreenPolice on the scene after the incident.Photograph: UNPIXS/BBCHarry Rashid, 48, from Solihull, was at the parade with his wife and two young daughters when he witnessed the collision. “It happened about 10 feet away from us … The vehicle came to our right. It emerged from just right next to an ambulance, which was parked up. This grey people carrier just pulled up from the right and just rammed into all the people at the side of us.“It was travelling south, down Water Street, straight towards the Strand, which is where the docks are. It was extremely fast. Initially, we just heard the pop, pop, pop of people just being knocked off the bonnet of a car.Rashid described how crowds began trying to smash the car windows: “Then he stalled for a few seconds, probably about 10 seconds. Then the crowd that was a bit further back started rushing at him trying to smash his windows.“But then he put his foot down again and just ploughed through the rest of them, he just kept going. It was horrible. And you could hear the bumps as he was going over the people. Then my daughter started screaming and there were people on the ground.“It looked clearly deliberate.”View image in fullscreenPolice cordons have been put in place around the heavily littered road, with emergency service vehicles attending.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersRashid continued: “They were just innocent people, just fans going to enjoy the parade. There were hundreds and thousands of us there because this is probably the busiest part of Liverpool. We were shocked, couldn’t believe it.”Emergency services arrived at the scene “within seconds”, he said. “Ambulances were already there. There was one right next to where this occurred, so there was a paramedic inside there.“But then they started arriving within seconds, they’re all trying to get to the crowd and negotiate the crowd, which is very difficult to do, you see, because there’s that many people, they’ve constantly been trying to move.“I just wanted my kids to get off the road regardless because I couldn’t trust whether there’s a follow-up attack or something like that. Because you are just exposed there on the pavement.“I saw people lying on the ground, people unconscious. It was horrendous. So horrendous.”Natasha Rinaldi, who was watching the parade from her friend’s living room, said: “People were very angry and shocked, and then the police intervened. And then we heard the ambulances coming.”North West ambulance service said the scene was cleared by about 9.30pm.View image in fullscreenThe collision came just after roads were reopened after the main parade had finished, the Guardian understands.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersKeir Starmer and the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, are being kept updated about events.Starmer said: “The scenes in Liverpool are appalling – my thoughts are with all those injured or affected. I want to thank the police and emergency services for their swift and ongoing response to this shocking incident.“I’m being kept updated on developments and ask that we give the police the space they need to investigate.”In a statement posted on social media, Liverpool FC said: “We are in direct contact with Merseyside police regarding the incident on Water Street which happened towards the end of the trophy parade earlier this evening.“Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by this serious incident.“We will continue to offer our full support to the emergency services and local authorities who are dealing with this incident.”Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool city region, said: “Our hearts go out to all of those affected, especially those who have been injured. Thank you, as ever, to the first responders for their professionalism and swift action.“This is a difficult day for our city region, but we stand together.”A spokesperson for the north west ambulance service said: “NWAS is supporting an incident in Liverpool city centre, following reports of a road traffic collision.“We are currently assessing the situation and working with other members of the emergency services. Our priority is to ensure people receive the medical help they need as quickly as possible.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But they urge him to act without delay as “urgent and decisive action is required to avert the destruction of the Palestinian people of Gaza”.The signatories, including the former supreme court justices Lord Sumption and Lord Wilson, court of appeal judges and more than 70 KCs, say that war crimes, crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law are being committed in Palestine.There is mounting evidence of genocide, which is either being perpetrated or at a minimum at serious risk of occurring, the letter states, highlighting recent comments by the Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who said Israel’s armywould “wipe out”what remains of Palestinian Gaza.The signatories tell Starmer: “All states, including the UK, are legally obliged to take all reasonable steps within their power to prevent and punish genocide; to ensure respect for international humanitarian law; and to bring to an end violations of [the right to self-determination]. The UK’s actions to date have failed to meet those standards … The international community’s failure to uphold international law in relation to the occupied Palestinian territory contributes to a deteriorating international climate of lawlessness and impunity and imperils the international legal system itself. Your government must act now, before it is too late.”The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, last week announcedthe suspension of negotiationsover a new free trade deal with Israel, but the two-page letter, backed by a 35-page legal memorandum, says he must go further, faster by reviewing existing trade ties, suspending the 2030 roadmap for closer UK-Israel partnership and imposing trade sanctions.The legal experts call on him to immediately sanction Israeli ministers or senior officials in the Israel Defense Forces who they accuse of having incited genocide or supporting and sponsoring illegal settlements. They note that so far financial sanctions and travel bans have beenlimited to individual settlers, settler outposts and settler organisations.The Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, has previously said: “The charge of genocide levelled against Israel is not only false, it’s outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it.”The letter, also signed by the former court of appeal judges Sir Stephen Sedley, Sir Anthony Hooper and Sir Alan Moses, a former chair of the bar of England and Wales (Matthias Kelly KC) and of the bar of Northern Ireland (Brian Fee KC), says Israel has been responsible for “an unparalleled assault on the United Nations”.It points to Israel’s banning of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, which it calls the “backbone of aid” for the Palestinian people, from operating in the occupied territory and “attacks on UN premises, property and personnel”. These acts are said to “go beyond isolated breaches. They amount to a broader challenge to the UN charter system itself.”Accordingly, as a permanent member on the UN security council, the signatories say the UK should consider initiating proceedings that provide for suspension of a member state.Moses said: “We, in the UK, cannot expect peace unless we fulfil our obligations under international law. That is what upholding the rule of law means. It is an exercise in futility for a government to say it upholds the rule of law, if it then does nothing to demonstrate it.”Prof Guy Goodwin-Gill, a signatory and emeritus fellow of All Souls College, University of Oxford, said: “Now is the time for the UK to show its commitment to the rule of law and to a future in which Palestinians can freely fulfil their right to self-determination. Everyone must be free from persecution, from displacement and ethnic cleansing, from the devastation and death deliberately inflicted on them in their homes, schools and hospitals, in their farms and villages. No one should ever be a refugee in their own land.”Lammy’s strongest intervention on Israel to date came amid anger at Israel’s refusal to allow thousands of aid trucks access tostarving Palestinians. While an 11-week blockade has officially been lifted, the letter says that the limited aid allowed in “remains gravely insufficient to address the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe”.More than53,000 Palestinians have been killedby the Israeli offensive in Gaza since 7 October 2023 when a Hamas attack on southern Israel killed 1,200 people. An Israeli strike early on Monday on a school turned shelter, while people inside were sleeping, killed 36, according to health officials.1:19Dozens killed after Israeli attack on school used as shelter in Gaza – video reportAlso on Monday, one of Israel’s staunchest allies, Germany, added to international condemnation, with the chancellor,Friedrich Merz, saying the harm inflicted on civilians “can no longer be justified as a fight against Hamas terrorism”.In order to meet its legal obligations, the UK is also urged in the letter to secure an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the resumption of aid and the lifting of Israel’s ban on Unrwa. Finally, it says the UK should confirm that it would executethe international criminal court’s arrest warrantsagainst the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant.The letter increases the pressure on Starmer to act in the same week that the attorney general, Lord Hermer KC, is due to deliver the Rusi thinktank’s annual security lecture on “the condition of the international-rules-based-order”.Many Labour and Tory backbenchers have already said that the suspension of talks on the free trade deal does not go nearly far enough.Aprevious letterfrom members of the UK legal community sent last year said the UK was breaching international law by continuing to arm Israel. Weapons sales are not addressed in the latest missive because the issue isawaiting judgment by the high court in Londonafter a legal challenge.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesFriedrich MerzDavid LammyMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

The latter two countries were the first on Trump’s tariff hitlist when heannounced tariffs of 25% on 1 February.Canadians in particular were incensed at Trump’s repeated suggestions that its northern neighbour would bebetter off annexed as the 51st state of the US.According to Trivago’s findings, which were shared with PA Media, demand among Germans was also “down heavily”, with hotel bookings in the US showing a single-digit percentage decline.Germany is the largest economy in the EU, which Trump has repeatedly threatened with increased tariffs, most recently saying on Sunday he had“paused” a 50% taxhe intended to introduce next month.There has not been a significant change in the numbers of UK holidaymakers travelling to the US. The UK has so far faced some of the lightest tariffs globally and last month struck a“breakthrough” trade deal with the US.Businesses operating in its $2.6tn tourism industry are becoming increasingly concerned about a“Trump slump”due to the turmoil the president’s tariff war is causing on the global economy.Last month, the federal government’s National Travel and Tourism Office released preliminary figures showingvisits to the US from overseas fell by 11.6% in Marchcompared with the same month last year.Bookings made via Expedia-owned Trivago also show that Americans are spending less on their trips, while there is higher demand for cheaper hotels and lower star categories.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has gone absolutely CRAZY!” Trump said of the Russian president on Truth Social. “I’ve always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that’s proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!”mapTrump also posted that the Ukrainian leader “is doing his Country no favours by talking the way he does. Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop.”Zelenskyy, however, doubled down on his criticism on Monday. “Only a sense of total impunity can allow Russia to carry out such strikes and continue increasing their scale,” Zelensky said on social media, adding: “The increase in Russian strikes should be met with increased sanctions.”While Trump had suggested earlier, speaking to reporters, that he may be considering new sanctions, there was no indication on Monday morning of any meaningful US action against Moscow.The sheer scale of Putin’s defiance of Trump following last Monday’s call between the two leaders has imploded the US president’s ill-defined strategy for ending the war in Ukraine, which Trump had promised to do within 24 hours upon taking office.View image in fullscreenUkrainian rescuers work at the site of a residential area struck by a rocket in an overnight strike in a village near Kyiv on Sunday.Photograph: Sergey Dolzhenko/EPAThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, said Trump realised Putin had lied to him and he hoped his anger “translates into action”, calling for a deadline to be set for Moscow to agree to a Ukraine ceasefire, backed up by the threat of “massive sanctions”.But with Trump so far rejecting European calls for toughening sanctions against Russia, and pressure for an immediate 30 ceasefire, Putin has called Washington’s bluff to press ahead with its war on Ukraine.The Kremlin on Monday sought to downplay Trump’s remarks, attributing them to “emotional overload”, while adding that Moscow was “very grateful” to the US president for his continued engagement in peace talks.“This is a very crucial moment, which is naturally accompanied by emotional overload on all sides and emotional reactions,” the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow.Trump’s comments place Putin in an awkward position. The Russian president has been walking a delicate line – appearing to back peace talks to remain in Trump’s good graces, while pushing for terms that would amount to Ukraine’s de facto surrender.Russian state media largely ignored Trump’s description of Putin as “crazy”, instead selectively highlighting his criticism of Zelenskyy.Russia began escalating aerial assault on Ukraine’s cities on Friday launching a series of nightly strikes involving hundreds of drones that have sent Ukrainians to air raid shelters, basements and metro stations.The attacks overnight into Monday morning came after what had been the biggest aerial assault of the war, when Russia pummelled Ukrainian cities and other targets with at least 367 drones and missiles overnight on Sunday, killing at least 12 people, including three children, in the northern region of Zhytomyr.Russia has massively scaled up its domestic production of drones such as the Shahed, meaning it is no longer reliant upon Iran for its supply as it was when the weapons were first deployed even as it has developed sophisticated new tactics for their use, making them an increasingly potent weapon.Analysts are split, however, whether the heavy bombing of Ukrainian cities is a tactic in its own right, to demoralise the Ukrainian home front, or is part of a wider push on the battlefield going into the summer amid Ukrainian and western intelligence assessments that Russia intends to continue fighting through this year.On Sunday, Zelenskyy condemned “the silence of America” after Russia carried out its largest air raid in three years of war, with a second straight night of massive drone and ballistic missile strikes.“Every such terrorist Russian strike is reason enough for new sanctions against Russia,” Ukraine’s president said.During his campaign for the presidency, Trump claimed repeatedly that, if elected, he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours, even before being inaugurated.However, the intensity and frequency of this weekend’s strikes contrasted sharply with Trump’s claim that Vladimir Putin was interested in peace.The attacks meant Kyiv Day – celebrated on the last Sunday in May – began as exhausted people sheltered in bunkers, metro stations and basements.Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on Telegram: “Without pressure, nothing will change and Russia and its allies will only build up forces for such murders in western countries. Moscow will fight as long as it has the ability to produce weapons.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyTrump administrationUS foreign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

This is a bigger issue than Falkner, but she isn’t a help.”In April, the EHRC releasedinterim, non-statutory adviceabout how to interpret the ruling, which set out that transgender people should not be allowed to use toilets of the gender they live as, and that in some cases they cannot use toilets of their birth sex.A number of critics have called the advice oversimplistic. One Labour MP said: “A lot of lawyers told me it is utterly ridiculous, and the supreme court judgment does not necessarily mean that.” Some government officials are also worried, with one saying the EHRC had “bungled” the advice.Falkner, a crossbench peer, is seen as having led closely on the interim advice. Some EHRC sources said most senior staff had no idea it had even been drawn up until it was published on the organisation’s website late on a Friday evening.The EHRC initially set a two-week timetable for consulting on the full guidance, but changedthat to six weeksafter concern fromthe Commons women’s and equalities committee.While Falkner and the EHRC will be responsible for drawing up the formal guidance, this must then be signed off by the government, and some believe it could end up not being in place before Falkner is replaced.Last November she was given a 12-month extension on her four-year term. Harriet Harman, the Labour former cabinet minister who introduced the 2010 Equality Act to parliament, has been named as a possible successor.While a number of MPs believe Harman could do a better job, such a long delay in setting out how organisations should respond to the supreme court would risk months of confusion for them, and significant worry for transgender people.“Most public bodies don’t know what to do,” another MP said. “The government is frozen and waiting to see what the EHRC says. But I don’t think we’ll get anywhere with Falkner as chair. She’s not neutral.“Unless ministers are confident that all voices are being heard they won’t sign off on the guidance, and they are watching this very closely. It’s currently a bit of a mess.”John Kirkpatrick, the EHRC’s chief executive, said the interim update was “issued in response to a high level of demand for accurate information following the judgment”, and that Falkner had been “visible in providing clarity on the consequences of the judgment on behalf of the EHRC”.He added: “Like all well-governed organisations, we have robust decision-making processes and internal channels through which colleagues can escalate concerns. We do not recognise the views attributed to ‘insiders’ as being representative of our staff.”Explore more on these topicsEquality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)GenderTransgenderEquality Act 2010LGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Scottish Labour contacted Meta, Facebook’s parent company, about the video two weeks ago and has yet to receive a reply.On Monday the Daily Record reported that the SNP chief executive, Carol Beattie, had also written to Meta, stating that the advert “appears designed to provoke division, stir racial resentment and marginalise Pakistani residents in Scotland”.Scottish Labour accused of trying to hide candidate’s link to scandal-hit firmRead moreThe byelection for the Holyrood seat of Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse, prompted by the death of the popular Nationalist MSP Christina McKelvie in March, is being fiercely contested, with Reform seemingly gaining ground from Labour and the SNP. The 5 June byelection will serve as a significant bellwether less than a year before the Scottish parliament elections due in May 2026.The advert reproduced a decontextualised clip of Sarwar speaking at an event celebrating the 75th anniversary of Pakistan’s independence in 2022, when he said: “Pakistanis need represented in every mainstream political party in Scotland and across the UK.” It appears alongside the text “Anas Sarwar has said he will prioritise the Pakistani community”. He does not say this anywhere in the clips shown.View image in fullscreenA still from the Reform UK campaign video.Photograph: Reform/FacebookSpeaking on Monday, Swinney said: “We’ve got to address racism wherever it happens, which is why the SNP has complained toMetaabout an advert attacking the Labour party, and because issues about racism are above party politics.“Anas Sarwar is a political rival of mine, but he shouldn’t be subjected to that kind of racist attack and we want to make sure that we stand in solidarity against the tactics of Farage.”Swinney said he would push back on the advert if it was referenced on the doorstep, as did the SNP’s candidate, Katy Loudon.Last month, Swinney held a cross-party summit in Glasgow, inviting faith groups and third-sector leaders to discuss protection of democratic values, misinformation and the rise of the far right in Scotland. On Monday he said: “One of the themes of the discussions we had in Glasgow a few weeks ago was all about misinformation and distortion. It’s debasing our politics. People can’t make informed judgments because they’re having disinformation peddled towards them.”Last Thursday a spokesperson for Sarwar said the advert was “blatantly racist” and that it “attempts to question the identity, loyalty and belonging of Anas Sarwar”.“Anas was born in Scotland and has lived here all his life. He is a proud Scot who has worked in our NHS and campaigns to deliver for every Scot. Decent people across Scotland will reject Reform’s divisive politics.”TheReform UKcouncillor Thomas Kerr said: “John Swinney and Anas Sarwar are desperately trying to deflect attention away from the facts. This advert uses Mr Sarwar’s own words – if he doesn’t like them, he shouldn’t use them.“The SNP and Labour have both broken Scotland, it’s no surprise they’re now forming some sort of pathetic and panicky anti-Reform coalition. The more Reform grows the more desperate their lies and smears will get but we’re ready for it. Unlike them we aren’t fighting for our careers, we’re fighting for our country.”Despite McKelvie’s substantial majority when she held the seat, Swinney also acknowledged that the contest was “tight” and “still very difficult to call”.Explore more on these topicsScottish politicsScotlandScottish National party (SNP)Anas SarwarJohn SwinneyReform UKMetanewsShareReuse this content"

For a select number of daredevils flocking to Gloucestershire, however, the day is spentchasing a wheel of cheese down a hill.The annual tradition, thought to date back to 1826, sees competitors sprint, trip and tumble down Cooper’s Hill near Brockworth to try to win an 8lb wheel of double gloucester.The cheese is given a head start of a few seconds and is said to roll down the hill at up to 70mph. The cheese is chased 200 yards down the 1:2 gradient hill. The first person to the bottom wins the cheese.Among this year’s winners were a YouTuber and university student raising money for refugees and homeless people.0:42Thrill-seekers hurl themselves down Cooper's Hill in annual cheese rolling contest – videoThe recent dry spell of weather made the racetrack harder, slower and more dangerous for the competitors, who were cheered on by thousands of supporters.The German YouTuber Tom Kopke, 23, from Munich, was the winner of the first men’s downhill race, retaining the title he won last year.“It was crazy. This year was different,” he said. “Last year the hill was muddy and this year it was dry and dangerous and people got injured.“I shut off my brain and went for it. All the people at the top said they were going to steal my title but this is mine. I worked for this. I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.”Rod Smart, who has produced cheese for the chase for more than 25 years, once again provided the wheels for this year’s event.Four cheeses weighing about 3kg each and three smaller ones, weighing about 1.5kg, are used.The women’s race was won by Ava Sender Logan, 20, who was racing for the Refugee Community Kitchen, which supports displaced people in northern France and homeless people in London and Edinburgh.View image in fullscreenAva Sender Logan emerged victorious in her first ever attempt at the cheese-rolling race.Photograph: Anthony Upton/AP“This is my first time,” the student from London said. “I thought it was such a tradition, and I will probably feel it tomorrow.“I can’t believe it. It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m down, that’s what matters. I’m fine.”The second men’s race was won by Luke Preece, from Gloucester, who ran down the hill dressed in a Superman costume. “I am absolutely buzzed, amazing … the adrenaline,” he said afterwards. “My dad did it, I can’t believe it, it’s amazing.”The final men’s downhill race was won by Byron Smith, 33, from New Zealand, who had to settle for second place last year. “It feels great,” he said. “I did it last year and came second in my heat and I thought I could do it this year and I did.”‘You just have to roll’: Gloucestershire cheese-rolling race has international appealRead moreSince 2010, the event has been staged unofficially. Health and safety fears causedthe official competition to be cancelledwhen more than 15,000 people turned up to watch the 2009 competition.Since then, it has been held under police supervision. Local roads were closed up to two and a half miles around the slope.In 2013, the wheel of cheese wasreplaced with a lightweight foam versionover safety fears but, the next year, the real deal returned for good.The origin of the competition is unknown. Some believe it came from claiming grazing rights on the common and land around Cooper’s Hill; others think it could have been a fertility ritual.The popularity of the contest has boomed in recent years, with competitors and TV crews travelling from around the world. The BBC has even livestreamed the races, sometimes having to apologise for the ripe language spluttered at the adrenaline-fuelled event.Explore more on these topicsGloucestershireCheeseEnglandHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

It will leave you rushing back to her booksLucy ManganMon 26 May 2025 17.00 EDTShareIt is a truth universally acknowledged that if ever a novelist deserved a three-hour documentary deploying all the experts, all the excerpts from book and screen, all the re-enactments, all the life, all the literature, every bell and whistle, it isJane Austenin the year 2025, the 250th anniversary of her birth.So, here it is – Jane Austen: Rise of a Genius. It’s a title that doesn’t mess around and neither does the programme, a prestigiously-bound triple-decker narrated by Juliet Stevenson that takes us through Austen’s birth, background, personal life, creative imagination, publishing history, private and professional setbacks and successes, with all the care and close attention a fan could wish for.A host of informative Janeites gather for the event, among them her biographer Dr Paula Byrne; academics Dr Priya Atwal, Dr Louise Curran and Dr Paddy Bullard; writers Bee Rowlatt, Candice Carty-Williams, Helen Fielding, Colm Tóibín and Kate Atkinson; “Renaissance man” Sam West (don’t write in – that’s metaphorical; I know we’re Georgianning); actors Tom Bennett, Charity Wakefield, Greg Wise and many more. The mood is impassioned and enthusiastic without being emetic – suffused with love of the work, and mapping the contours of the specific genius without anyone getting un-Janeishly carried away. You feel she would approve.Off we go, then, back to the genteelly impoverished childhood as one of the eight children of a hardworking rector father. He gave his daughter two great and rare gifts for the time: his unwavering support of her gifts from the first days they made themselves known, and unfettered access to his 500-volume library, which included many examples of the novelty form that was then the novel. One of her earliest writings is the story of The Beautiful Cassandra, whose heroine – named after her beloved sister – is an adventurous young miss who storms round London punching pastry chefs. It will have you immediately online locating the nearest copy of the juvenilia you can find.On through Lady Susan, the bereavements, the broken engagements, first publication at the age of 35, the big six books, the growing confidence and success, the patronage of the Prince Regent (she didn’t like him or the excessive age he created but he was the “influencer” of his day so she wisely accepted it), battles with publishers, the punishing illness through which she wrote the end of Persuasion and the beginning of Sanditon, and her eventual untimely death at the age of 41. She was, they say, at the peak of her powers – but how do we know? She may only just have begun the ascent. “The sun of my life, the gilder of every pleasure, the soother of every sorrow” as Cassandra wrote of her sister, who was buried in Winchester Cathedral with four people in attendance and a headstone that did not mention her career. Nor, feted though she was, did her name appear on any of her novels during her lifetime.But, strewn with a generous hand along the chronology are rarer, deeper acknowledgments of Austen’s accomplishments and at least as much discussion of the less-adapted, more difficult novels. One such, certainly, is Mansfield Park, with its undertow of criticism of the slave trade and the people growing fat on the profits of human suffering, which went resolutely unreviewed by the press when it was published and unmentioned by Sir Walter Scott in his otherwise acutely perceptive 1815 appraisal of her work. Another is the melancholic final (completed) work Persuasion.We are invited to marvel at her invention of what has come to be known as free indirect style, whereby the voices of characters shift almost imperceptibly into the voice of the narrator and vice versa, so that you discern their thoughts and commentary on them at the same time (and, as Tóibín puts it, “becomes a drama between the reader and the page”). Likewise, her concept of the unreliable narrator, and the beauty and economy of her language, whether in famous opening lines, agonising marriage proposals or perfect, peerless declarations of enduring love. “I am half agony, half hope” (Persuasion) …It is a documentary that discharges its duty well and fully – not least in inspiring most of the audience, I am sure, to head straight back to the books and glory in them anew.Jane Austen: Rise of a Genius aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJane AustenDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

Until it took a strange turn …Graeme VirtueMon 26 May 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 17.01 EDTShareThis article contains spoilers for theThe Last of Usseason two. Please do not read unless you have seen episodes one to six.Typical. For the back half of this season, Ellie (Bella Ramsey) has been hunting high and low for Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) in Seattle, desperate to avenge the brutal killing of Joel (Pedro Pascal). But ultimately it was Abby who ambushed Ellie, at exactly the worst possible time. As season-ending cliffhangers go, it certainly served to turbo-charge the suspense. Just who will be left alive after that final panicked gunshot in the theatre lobby?Even before that emotionally charged confrontation, this finale had been carefully ratcheting up the tension. There were heartbreaking confessions, a close call with disembowelment and at least one deeply regrettable death, all as an ominous tempest rumbled overhead. Do they still name storms in the post-apocalyptic year of 2029? Call this one Storm Metaphor: dark, relentless and getting increasingly violent as the night went on. Let’s look at how it all shook out.A painful reunionView image in fullscreenLearning the truth at last … Dina (Isabela Merced).Photograph: HBOLast time we saw Dina (Isabela Merced), she had just taken a Seraphite crossbow bolt to the thigh. Back in the relative refuge of the theatre, Jesse (Young Mazino) scrambles to fix up his ex-girlfriend’s wound in true frontier medicine style (splash some alcohol on it, push the arrow out). When Ellie belatedly returns, it is Dina’s turn to play nurse, tending to her heavily bruised back. With her shirt off, the usually tough-as-nails Ellie suddenly seemed physically vulnerable. She opens up emotionally, too, telling Dina about hurting Nora (Tati Gabrielle) to get information about Abby’s location.While she managed to extract a couple of cryptic clues (talk of a “whale” and a “wheel”), Ellie is now more struck by how quickly she took to torture: “I thought it would be harder to do.” This soul-baring spills over into finally telling Dina the truth about what Joel did in Salt Lake City, and how Ellie finally figured it all out. It’s a lot for poor Dina – pregnant, seriously injured and cooped up in a war zone with both the father of her baby and her new girlfriend – to process.Tactical advances, tactical retreatsThe next morning Jesse is itching to meet back up with Joel’s brother, Tommy (Gabriel Luna), and get the hell out of Seattle. He and Ellie leave the hobbling Dina to barricade herself into the theatre while they strike out for the bookstore rendezvous. En route they witness a skirmish between a lone Seraphite and six aggressive WLF troops, and Ellie is all for wading in, guns blazing, to save the boy. It’s impulse-driven compassion, but to the exasperated Jesse it reads like recklessness. The tension between them foreshadows Ellie’s fateful decision later in the day.View image in fullscreenIsaac (Jeffrey Wright) mulls over the WLF’s strategy.Photograph: HBOA quick check-in with the WLF leadership: sombre leader Isaac (Jeffrey Wright) and his loyal lieutenant Elise (Hettienne Park) are planning their big assault on the island home of the Seraphites. The storm gathering above seems like a bad omen, but it may provide useful cover for their beach landing operation. Isaac is hung up on the continued absence of Owen (Spencer Lord), Mel (Ariela Barer) and particularly Abby. “You in love with her or something?” half-jokes Elise, which seems like a risky thing to say to your superior. But we learn that Isaac has chosen Abby as the best of her young generation to lead the WLF and “secure their future”. As we haven’t spent much time with Abby this season, it’s some useful context as to how she fits in with the militia.Tommy in troubleBack at the bookstore rendezvous, there’s no sign of Tommy. But some WLF radio chatter interrupts Jesse and Ellie’s frenemy bickering and alerts them to a nearby sniper. As they know the Seraphites don’t use guns, they surmise it must be Tommy, and ascend to a decent vantage point to try to spot him. That’s when Ellie spots a ferris wheel and guesses that Abby must be holed up in a nearby flooded aquarium. She has a clear-cut choice: help save Tommy or pursue a flimsy lead on Abby for revenge. To Jesse’s disgust she chooses the latter.‘When medieval times return, I’ll be ready’: Bella Ramsey on friendship, fashion and The Last of UsRead moreThe storm is really whipping up now. Down at the shore, Ellie sees a fleet of WLF boats pushing through the rain toward their invasion target. She manages to find her own little speedboat, but as she sets course for the aquarium it soon becomes clear she is in over her head – heaving waves tip her out of the boat, onto a beach and into the hands of the Seraphites. We’ve seen how this cult treats outsiders: hanging them by the neck and disembowelling them with very unhygienic-looking sickles. Despite her protests, Ellie is strung up and about to be sliced open when an alarm horn from their besieged village scatters her attackers. Phew!Caught in the crossfireThis, of course, would be the perfect time to count your blessings and retreat. But Ellie has come too far and invested too much. She completes her journey to the aquarium, taking time out to methodically dry Joel’s revolver and bullets. As she advances through the darkened corridors, she hears the voices of Owen and Mel. Soon she is threatening to kill them if they don’t tell her where to find Abby. Owen pretends to cooperate but it is just a ruse to get closer to his gun.All that WLF training is for naught: Ellie shoots him dead and Mel takes a bullet to the neck. As Mel begins to bleed out, Ellie realises with horror that she is pregnant and is using her final, gasping breaths to implore her killer to save her baby by improvising a C-section with a knife. Despite her usual gumption, Ellie is completely overwhelmed by the situation and cannot bring herself to do anything.A hell of a comedownView image in fullscreenJesse (Young Mazino).Photograph: HBOThat’s when Tommy and Jesse swoop in and whisk Ellie back to the relative safety of the theatre. She is wrestling with the carnage she has caused but still struggles with the idea of leaving Seattle with her revenge quest incomplete. If she doesn’t kill Abby, then what was the point of all the others dying? But the group are determined to return to Jackson, so Joel will remain unavenged. “Are you able to make your peace with that?” asks Tommy. They vow to leave at first light.It has certainly been an eventful three days in Seattle. But as Ellie and Jesse patch up their tattered friendship in the auditorium, they hear shouts and shots coming from the lobby. As they burst through the doors, they are greeted by gunplay. Jesse takes the brunt of it, and looks like a goner. Abby has tracked them down and seeing Ellie only seems to enrage her more. “You,” she hisses. Ellie tries to offer up her life in exchange for sparing the wounded Tommy, but Abby simply doesn’t want to hear it: “I let you live … and you wasted it!” A gunshot cuts to darkness. It’s a long enough pause to imagine every horrible potential outcome.Then we are back with Abby in a cluttered WLF compound. There is the briefest glimpse of Manny (Danny Ramirez), the final accomplice to Joel’s murder, who says that Isaac wants to see them. Abby wanders out to reveal she is in a sports stadium repurposed as a settlement. A final caption confirms that this is Seattle Day One, when Ellie and Dina first arrived in the city.Rewinding the clocks seems to be preparing the ground to tell Abby’s side of the story next time. But ending with a focus on a character who has been so elusive throughout season two feels a little frustrating. And who knows how long it will be before we learn exactly what went down in that lobby.Notes and observationsRIP Owen and Mel. If you count poor infected Nora, that means Ellie has crossed out three of the five young WLF members on her kill list. But what were the pair conspiring about when Ellie ambushed them? It feels as though there is a lot more WLF backstory to be revealed in future seasons.Back inepisode threeit felt safe to assume Jesse had voted in favour of hunting down and executing Joel’s killers. But during one of his various exasperated exchanges with Ellie he revealed he was actually one of the eight council members who voted against the motion.Jesse also mentioned that while infiltrating the city, he and Tommy had found Ellie’s horse, Shimmer –last spotted back in episode four– thankfully safe and well in that hipster record shop.A third season of The Last of Us was confirmed before season two even launched. But would that be enough to finish adapting all ofthe second (and so far final) game? Last week co-showrunner Craig Mazin suggested thatseason three might end up being longer, and that his hopes were pinned on a fourth season to wrap up the story.What did you think? Did this feel like a satisfying end to season two? What do you hope is explored in the next season?

It is Friday morning at school – but not as you know it.This is Bearded Theory’s Festival School, where parents can enrol their children so they can spend a day in festival-themed lessons – without risking a fine for taking them out of school during term time.Founded 10 years ago, the school at theDerbyshirefestival – the only one of its kind in the country – has had children budget a festival in maths classes, write and perform songs in English and music lessons and take part in PE lessons run by Derby County and Mr Motivator.The lessons, which take place for one day only on Friday at the festival, are different every year because about 90% of pupils are returning students. Places – which are free – are booked up in a matter of hours.“We follow the national curriculum, and all the schemes of work, and lesson plans do, but we’re just a bit creative with it,” Dave Hancox, the school’s SEN co-ordinator, said.As a director of children services specialising in learning disabilities, his role is to ensure all children can take part in lessons. In some cases, they have had 3:1 support from teaching assistants for children who require it.“No matter what need that child has, we’ve never not accepted a child,” he added. “It’s probably the most inclusive school in the country, I’d argue.”View image in fullscreenThere are 200 places for children at the school.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianHancox was recruited by Sally Booth, the founder and head of the festival school, when she found out he was the headteacher of a nearby specialist provision school. He is now one of the school’s senior leadership team.“It originally came from when the laws changed around school absences,” Hancox said, with a lot of parents worrying they would be fined if they brought their children for longer than a weekend.“So the discussion was had around all the team here, and we sort of said, well, why can’t we run a school here? And that’s where the original idea came from,” he said. “And 10 years on we’re still doing it.”Parents register for the festival school earlier in the year, and staff will contact the children’s usual schools to have the day marked as an authorised absence for off-site learning – similar to a school trip.It is open to children from reception to year 10, with 200 places available each year. “We don’t take year 11s because it’s GCSE time for them and they shouldn’t be here,” Booth said.Often, Hancox said, the feedback from parents is that their “kids have engaged more at this school than they do at normal school”.View image in fullscreenLessons at Bearded Theory are not limited to the classroom.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“We’re not constrained to classroom, we’re not constrained to four walls, we can adapt,” he said. “And ultimately, the staffing ratios here are probably better than most schools in the country. So the feedback is always really positive.”“We all think that education doesn’t need to be in a classroom,” Booth, who previously worked as a teacher for 20 years, said. “It doesn’t need to be in a school with a trust, and an academy, and all of the paperwork and the KPIs [key performance indicator].”“I’m not going to be measured on what they’ve learned today,” she added, “but the school will as a whole, because of the enrolments that come in next year, and the returners.“I see the same names every year,” she said, “and it’s brilliant, but there’s still space for new people to come as well, so it works.”Gemma Edwards, 38, an occupational therapist from Stafford, has enrolled her daughter Lillie, six, for a second year of festival school. She started in reception last year. “She loved it,” Edwards said. “She’s been talking about it all year, and it’s exciting to come back.”Bearded Theory is Edwards’ favourite festival, she said, and “the festival school is part of that”.“It’s amazing,” she added, “because you want to make the most out of the festival, it gives me and my husband some time. We have always loved festivals together, and now [Lillie’s] on board with it as well, but you do sometimes miss having that time together,” she said.View image in fullscreenVictoria Mynett, 46, has brought her daughter to the festival for the third year.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“So it’s nice for her to do something that she’s enjoying, but us to get a bit of a daytime together as well. So it’s lovely for all of us, really.”Heather Bayley, 44, and husband, Jason, 53, have brought their daughters Lottie, 9, and Lola, 14, who is in year 10. “I think she’s a little bit sad it’s her final year,” Jason, an accountant said.“We speak to a lot of friends, and people who go to other festivals – nowhere else does anything like this,” he added. “We’ve been to different sort of places, we’ve never come across anything like it. So it’s amazing.”Heather, who works in a nursery, said: “The amount of prep that must go beyond the scenes, and with safeguarding, it’s deeper than just the kids coming to their classes and having a bit of fun,. I don’t know half the amount that Sally does, but I can only imagine from the work that I do.”Victoria Mynett, 46, a paediatric nurse, has brought her eight-year-old daughter Sorori to festival school for the third time. She is such a fan of the festival school that she has volunteered to help there next year.“I just know that this is going to nourish them, and this is good for everybody, and they cater for all the needs,” she said.“They’ve got the alternative provision, which is perfect for a lot of children, my eldest daughter did that last year. It’s brilliant.”“Our school just embraced it and said, of course you can do that,” she added. “And then she brings back to school so much that she’s done, and she shares it with everyone, and everybody wants to come next year.”Explore more on these topicsCultureFestivalsDerbyshireSchool attendance and absencefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here is what I found out after my diagnosisEmma SzewczakMon 26 May 2025 04.42 EDTFirst published on Sun 18 May 2025 09.00 EDTShareWhen I experienced pelvic organ prolapse after giving birth to my daughter in 2019, I had no idea – and neither, seemingly, did my doctors – how much my life was about to change. Every new “surprise” – from not being able to use tampons, to an almost constant cycle of UTIs – felt all the worse for my lack of mental and practical preparation.This shouldn’t be the case: around a half of all women will have some degree of pelvic organ prolapse in their lifetime. There are four types: vaginal, uterine, bladder and rectal, all of which involve one or more pelvic organs descending into the vagina. Often, it creates an internal bulge, but when it is more progressed it can be externally visible too. Prolapse being so varied – and, crucially, understudied – makes for a great proliferation of potential symptoms which are, in my opinion, generally underplayed in healthcare literature. Living with an organ descending into your vagina is frequently described as “uncomfortable”, as though comparable to wearing a too small pair of jeans. The NHS website describes what can be truly debilitating stress urinary incontinence (SUI) as “problems [with] peeing”. What little information is available on prolapse seems designed to remind you that what you’re experiencingis no big deal!But for many of us, that is far from the case.My own prolapse wascaused by childbirth, but it can also be brought on by injury,menopause, age, or for simply no (as yet known by medical research) reason at all. You might have none of the symptoms and no idea you even have it; conversely, you might have all of the symptoms and yet struggle to get a diagnosis. Six years on and, while I have a general diagnosis of “pelvic organ prolapse”, I do not knowwhichprolapse I have, to what degree or whether or not I have multiple prolapses. Though I’m far from content with this shocking lack of information about my condition, I – through necessity – focus on what Idoknow, to get through the day. Here is everything I have learned, and everything I wish I had already known about living with pelvic organ prolapse, before I had to.Penetrative sexwillbe differentWhen I was first diagnosed with prolapse, I didn’t think about the effect it might have on my sex life. But, as it turns out, this is probably the area of my life that’s been most negatively affected. Yes, I have stress urinary incontinence (SUI) – but when is theworsttimeto lose control of your bladder? Yes, I have pain in my vagina – but when is theworsttimeto feel pain in your vagina? At 29, and after a couple of nightmarish attempts at intercourse, I thought I’d never be able to have penetrative sex again; the pain was more than I could bear.With time, however, I realised that positioning was key. Having sex on my side so that the penis would not penetrate so deeply made a huge difference. Of course, this is no good if you get off on deeper penetration – for this, a friend advises placing a cushion under your bum, to lift your pelvis up and cause your cervix to recede. We both agree that lube is a huge help in encouraging the penis to “find the path of least resistance”. And as for the SUI? I pee beforehand, even if I don’t think I really need to. For others who may be embarrassed about losing control of their bladder, I’d recommend having sex in the bath or lubed up to the nines – both blessedly simple ways to disguise bigger or smaller leaks.… and so will your periodWhile prolapse shouldn’t affect your period, your periodcanaffect your prolapse. I certainly notice an increased heaviness in my vagina and, in the days before my period arrives, I feel particularly reluctant to overexert myself physically. I now experience cramping more intensely in my vagina, perhaps due to the descent of my uterus, and I have to apply heat pads to my vulva rather than abdomen (over clothing, to prevent the risk of burns). I have found using tampons and Mooncups next to impossible; my prolapse simply squeezes them out almost as soon as I insert them. Returning to pads after a decade of not using them was disheartening for me personally, and I have yet to find a brand of period pants I can get on board with. All of this caused me to turn to the coil – which has, at least, helped to alleviate my physical symptoms. It’s not for everyone, though, and while I did not experience pain with insertion myself, I would recommend anyone concerned about this to ask their healthcare provider to use a local anaesthetic gel or spray (pain relief is not routinely offered for IUD fittings).Your relationship to exercise will changeThese days, it is generally only in the lead-up to my period, or after some particularly physical exertion, that my prolapse affects my mobility – but this was not the case for the first year or two. On the worst days, merely standing up felt like a monumental effort – I’d have to squeeze my pelvic floor muscles as hard as I could to combat the sense that my cervix was going to tumble out of me. Physiotherapists told me I shouldn’t pick up my baby– almost laughably impossible advice for a new parent – which left me questioning every cuddle. Friends who like to run took news of their prolapses particularly hard. One found herself unable to run 10 metres without losing full control of her bladder; incontinence pads were a gamechanger, once she was able to get past the stigma. Another option is a pessary – a small ring inserted into the vagina to help support the organs above it.You may have more gynaecological infectionsA risk that comes with pessary use, however, is the increased chance of vaginal infections. This is due to the pessary potentially introducing bacteria into the vagina, but prolapse in general is likely to increase infections. UTIs are the most common, as the descended organs can prevent the complete emptying of the bladder, or create small leaks and pooling of urine, which is a breeding ground for bacteria. After penetrative sex, residual semen can become trapped in the pockets created by the prolapse, also creating fertile ground for infection. It may seem that the answer to these problems is more rigorous hygiene standards, but introducing harsher products and rougher cleaning habits can actually have an adverse effect on the vaginal ecosystem. I have yet to come up with a better solution than regularly purchasing over-the-counter vaginal self-testing kits and requesting targeted medication from my GP, if needed. This is time consuming and expensive, and I hope that GPs will consider offering free self-testing kits for regularly occurring gynaecological infections in future.It may affect your future fertility optionsA number of healthcare professionals informed me that if I don’t want my prolapse to get any worse, I should not get pregnant again. Avoiding vaginal birth by having a caesarean section wouldn’t help, in my case, as the pressure put on my pelvic region by carrying another baby could be enough to greatly worsen my symptoms and future outlook. Surgical repair will only be offered to me once I’ve decided not to get pregnant again.It’s important to note that not all sufferers of prolapse are told that they should not become pregnant: it is judged on a case-by-case basis, and if you are prepared for your prolapse to potentially worsen then, of course, you can always go ahead with it, no matter what you are advised. But having to calculate that risk can be difficult for many. There is growing evidence to suggest that pessary use in pregnancy for those with advanced prolapse can lead to best post-birth outcomes, but more research into this and other interventions is sorely needed in order to provide as much reproductive choice as possible.The mental toll can feel impossible – but it isn’tWhen I was first diagnosed with prolapse, I didn’t want to leave my bed. Partly, this was because every step I took felt like it was making things physically, medically, worse. But mostly, it was because of the mental toll that having a prolapse had taken on me. Doctors seemed to barely understand my condition, and shrouded it in euphemisms. I had little idea what the rest of my life was going to look like, and I suddenly – after having a baby – felt entirely alienated from my body and the child I was advised not to pick up. This is, of course, fertile grounds for postnatal depression.It is important to acknowledge just how many people are in the same boatAnother demographic affected by pelvic organ prolapse are those experiencing menopause – people who, like those who have just given birth, are subject to vast hormonal fluctuations and are therefore more vulnerable to poor mental health. Understanding the psychological impact that gynaecological conditions can have must begin with understanding a key element of medical misogyny: that women’s health conditions are almost universallyunderstudied, undertreated, and underdiagnosed. Women find themselves experiencingmore pain, and with less likelihood of diagnosis and treatment.This can feel frustrating, like the system is stacked against us. But it is important to acknowledge just how many people are in the same boat; to campaign for better treatment options, and to work together to destigmatise conditions that are not talked about enough. Sharing my prolapse story with others, and then having so many people share their experiences with me, helped me to shed the shame I had initially felt at my body’s betrayal. Talking about how to achieve better sex, or how to manage my period, gave me a toolkit with which to move forward. We still need meaningful, institutional reform but, for now, I’m grateful not to be too ashamed to wear an incontinence pad if I need to.

TikTok has new rules for poop now?Not exactly. Do you rememberMarie Kondo?The tidying influencer?That’s the one. This rule is sort of an update to her dictum to throw out anything that doesn’t “spark joy”.Go on …Essentially, the rule is: “If this item was covered in poop, would I still keep it?”And who do we have to thank for this mental image?Lifestyle influencer Amanda Johnson. She called it “the easiest way to declutter your home”.“The easiest way” is to picture everything you owncovered in poop?The idea being it clarifies what items you value enough to clean up.The kids are safe, then.Maybe the dog. But what about everything else?Johnson told the Washington Post that the rule helped her to get rid of clothing she didn’t wear, board games and puzzles her family weren’t reaching for, and party decorations she was holding on to “just in case”.I’ve got cupboardsfull of that stuff, but picturing it allbrown and smelly doesn’t exactly make me want to roll up my sleeves and dive in.It’s a silly question, Johnson concedes – but a powerful one, too. “If it weighs me down or stinks up my space, it’s gotta go. Simple as that!”Who is this supposed to help?“People who are very visual,” according to the professional organiser Diane N Quintana.I don’t doubt that.Also those who “need extra motivation to declutter”.Again, I’m struggling to see how this is motivating.Supposedly, the rule is a way to make a game out of tidying up that’s especially effective for people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, by removing options and using a visual prompt to focus the mind.Does it have to be that, though? Could I not imagine taror Nutella?The disgust bit is key, according to Johnson, to help you “cut through emotional attachments”.I have no emotional attachments to the stuff in my junk drawer.Maybe the poop rule is just not for you. But you get the point: perhaps you don’t need all those miscellaneous cables and food-storage lids if you’re not prepared to go to any lengths to keep them.So what has Johnson said she’d willingly clean of faecal matter?Her great-grandmother’s china, being both precious and useful.And, may I point out, relatively easy to wipe down.I think you’re overthinking it.Do say:“This is the result of a society struggling with overconsumption.”Don’t say:“How much poop are we talking ...?”Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePass notesHomesHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it won’t redeem them – or change history’s courseMon 26 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 05.38 EDTShareWhy now? That’s the question. Why now, after 19 months of relentless assault that was plain for all to see, and declared by Israeli authorities themselves, has the tide begun to shift onGaza?Themarked change in tonethis past week from leaders in theUKandEUis a clear break from the pabulum of “concerns” and reiterations of Israel’s right to defend itself. Now the rhetoric is that Israel’s actions are “morally unjustifiable” and “wholly disportionate”, and the threats of its leaders “abhorrent”. Some of this is future-proofing. The war has amounted to genocide and ethnic cleansing in ways that are increasingly undeniable, indefensible and unspinnable. Some had a good go at it for a year and a half, but now cannot stand at a lectern or sit at a dinner table and argue that, yes, actually, there is an argument forkilling 100 people a day, as was the case last week. Or that Israel has any plan other than what its leaders have consistently declared to be one of displacement and settlement. Long gone is the argument that this is simply about wiping out Hamas. Israel, as one British media allylamented, has hung its friends out to dry.But there is a disconnect between condemnation and outrage, and what happens on the ground. When it comes to Israel, the levers of international censure are broken. Throughout the war, international organisations, humanitarian missions and courts of justice have been rendered powerless by their inability to translate their findings into action. Words alone mean nothing. They simply bounce off Israel’s iron dome of impunity. Every day, the world wakes up and is confronted with an Israeli leadership that violates every law of morality and logic. Victims are aggressors,humanitarians are biased, an army that kills unarmed medics is the mostmoral army in the world. Up is down.As Gaza’s children are bombed and starved, we watch - powerless. What is it doing to us as a society? | Rhiannon Lucy CosslettRead moreThe recent change in language from Israel’s international allies is remarkable. But it would be dangerous to overestimate its significance. Israeli authorities not only do not care, but draw strength from the condemnation. It all serves to prove that the country is on its own and must persevere because it is, as ever, misunderstood, discriminated against, surrounded by enemies. The shift feels like a breakthrough only in comparison to what came before. For so long, the act of calling what is happening in Gaza by its name has been traduced, even criminalised. There are peoplesitting in detentionfor the charge of describing reality. If anything, the past year and a half has seen a series of breakthroughs that signified nothing; historic protests, a sea change in global public opinion, a tussle at the heart of western political, legal and academic institutions over the right to protest against an unfolding genocide. Palestine, once a marginal issue, has become a mainstream one that lies at the heart of western politics and discourse. And yet, as long as governments with leverage over Israel refused to act, none of that saved a single life.There is still something in this moment that could be expanded into something meaningful. Politics tends towards inertia – the observance of alliances and the status quo. To upend that requires real crisis, yet Israel has managed to escalate its campaign in Gaza to a level that has scaled even that high bar. Standing by as a population starves, watching lives ebb away in plain sight, seeing the ribs and hollowed eye sockets oflethargic children, governments are tarred with the stain of complicity. To deprive people of food, to have such power over them, is not a military campaign of strategic goals involving regrettable collateral damage – it is the creation of a ghetto of mass punishment. A defining chapter of history is being written. The sponsors of this act are clearly identifiable, emphatically supportive, and yet now seem thrown off by the position they find themselves in. Duration also plays a role. It’s all gone on for too long and it has become clear that it is impossible to force through a habituation to mass murder. But it might also be this particular phase of Israel’s campaign, which is luridly more savage and naked in its intentions than it’s ever been.If this new attitude taken by western leaders is designed to fend off a reckoning, then it’s too little, too late: the record has already been taken. If it is to deter Israel from following through on its plans of scorching the conditions for life, forcing people to leave, and starving and killing those who remain, then they are facing down a juggernaut using little more than press releases. The gulf between Israel’s actions and the world’s reaction is still too wide to be proportional. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has already insulted France, the UK and Canada, accusing their governments ofsiding with Hamasjust for finally stating the obvious: that Israel should stop killing and starving people. In what world does amember of government declarethat it intends to wipe out what remains of an area and aims, “with God’s help”, to remove its inhabitants, only for the response be nothing more than vague threats of “concrete action”? What deterrence is required to stop a doctor going to work and thenreturning to the charred remainsof nine of her 10 children, wiped out in a single blow?It will take far more than the reviewing andsuspensionof future trade talks between Israel and the UK. Those mechanisms of censure that signal displeasure and motivate outlaws to come back into the fold have been shattered by an Israel that has made a virtue out of being outside it: the kind of action required would necessitate the overturning of deeply held fears and assumptions. First, the now risiblebelief that Israel is a stabilising ally in a hostile region, that it is a country that shares civilised western values and so should be supported. Then, the fear of a rift with Israel that will violate security arrangements and historical synergies – after all, Israel has already brought that about. It has upended regional and global political and moral settlements, and its allies have still not caught up. Once these truths have been accepted, the toolkit, so easily deployed to sanction other countries, is there to be mobilised. The US remains the party with the most influence, but it is not the only player. The EU constitutesabout a thirdof Israel’s total global trade: an embargo should be sought. Sanctions should be imposed, not just on settlers but on the politicians in government who have enabled them. Theinternational criminal court’s rulingson Israeli leadership should be observed. A blockade should be enforced, one that establishes in practice the pariah status that the Israeli government has long ago earned in principle.And even then, all this would only be a start, and a colossally, tragically late one at that. One can break down why none of these things have yet happened: the hopes that keeping Israel on side preserves some modicum of leverage; concerns that strong measures will embolden Iran; loyalty to the notion of historic debt; fears of the uncertain world that a break with Israel would usher in. But that world is already here, and cowardice has only accelerated its arrival, rather than prevented its emergence.Palestinians, from Gaza to the West Bank, are paying the highest price for inaction, but an acute wound has been inflicted on the rest of the world. If nothing happens, its moral and political morbidity will encompass all.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was still a coupZoe Williams‘Pandemic Profiteer’ sends a clear message: it is not OK to make millions out of a national emergencyMon 26 May 2025 12.02 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 13.57 EDTShareAt the Charleston literary festival earlier this month, two members ofLed By Donkeys– Ben Stewart and Oliver Knowles – were describing their first big act of 2023, which was to rename Michelle Mone’s yacht, Lady M, the “Pandemic Profiteer”. It’s a thrilling yarn, featuring a tiny boat rented under the false pretences of a picnic on the Catalan coast, a bunch of guys who didn’t really know how hard it would be to fix a giant sticker to a luxury yacht, and a chase scene at the end, as they raced back to their van, pursued by security guards.But the original idea had been to requisition the boat and sail it all the way back to the UK, up the Thames, and deliver it to His Majesty’s Treasury. There was an intake of breath in the book-loving audience, because this was the best idea anyone had ever heard. It had everything – audacity, symmetry, justice, spectacle, the lot.Despite the Guardian’s reporting, Mone, of course, wouldn’t admit until the end of 2023 that she profited from the government’s Covid VIP lane at all. In fact, £28.8m of the profit made by PPE Medpro, much of it on equipment that was never used, was held in a trust of which Mone and her children are beneficiaries. Inthe ickily self-justifying phrase of her husband, Doug Barrowman, they were “always going to benefit … her family benefit, my family benefit. That’s what you do when you are in a privileged position of making money.”The fates have arguably caught up with Mone since then. As detailed inthe BBC’s Rise and Fall documentary, which airs tonight, she is on leave from the House of Lords, having been stripped of the Conservative whip, and has had£75m worth of assets frozen, pending investigation by the National Crime Agency. (Mone has denied any wrongdoing.) While these measures are obviously the crunchy bit of comeuppance, and will loom much larger on Mone and Barrowman’s minds than a sticker on their yacht ever could, the art-activist event is way more important for us.I don’t especially care whether Mone has the Tory whip or not, or whether she sits in the House of Lords. If the state finds against her and claws back some money, fine, but it will most likely only spend it on something dismaying, such as a defence budget. “Pandemic Profiteer”, on the other hand, felt like a collective: “This is not OK.” It is not OK to make millions out of a national emergency. It’s fashionable now to say that Mone was a symptom of the late Tory malaise, not the cause. Led By Donkeys proved that it’s possible, if you concentrate hard enough, to think two things at once – both that governments should be competent, and that people, even businesspeople, should be decent.The Led By Donkeys installations are always laced with sadness, sometimes unbearable amounts. Its action for Gaza in 2024, when 11,000 children’s outfits were laid along Bournemouth beach – to “communicate the scale of the killing”, James Sadri said at the time – was breathtakingly painful, and has only become more striking with every day since. Yet these acts of resistance don’t arrange themselves in an orderly way, so that dodgy PPE pales into insignificance beside a war crime, and Liz Truss’s brief disaster as prime minister looks minor next to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Rather, they all create some social protection against despair. Whether it’s a misdeed or a tragedy, the fight only starts when you look directly at it.At the end of their talk, Knowles and Stewart got a standing ovation, a timeless and sometimes rote expression of approval, though I’ve never seen it happen at a spoken word event before. It didn’t really feel like the end of a ballet, though; it felt more literal, like everyone, spontaneously, standing up for something.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMichelle MoneOpinionLed By DonkeysCoronaviruscommentShareReuse this content"

As Labour announced it wouldchange tack on support for pensioners, would the government still vote to cut disabled people’s personal independence payments next month? If the economy is improving and Starmer wants to “make sure people feel those improvements”, would the upcoming child poverty plan see the two-child benefit limit finally abolished?Perhaps. As wasleaked quietly to the medialast Friday, it appears the government isn’t bumping up its flagship child poverty strategy – it’s delaying it. After 14 years of Conservative austerity and rising prices,more than one in three childrennow live in poverty in the UK – the highest level this century. Ministers are due to announce a package of up to £750m to tackle this crisis in June, but any new measures have reportedly been pushed back until at least the autumn.As one source saidof the reluctance of Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney to scrap the two-child limit: “He doesn’t think they would be getting enough political capital with voters as a result of the money they would have to put in.”Within a day, the Observer reported Starmer has privately told the cabinet that hedoesintend to end the two-child limit. The delay to the child poverty strategy, sources say, will allow the changes to be “fully costed.”It is not that such messy flip-flopping is surprising, of course, but that – coming only days after the winter fuel climbdown – any excuses for inaction are increasingly hard to swallow.These cruel benefit cuts will rob security from so many – but Labour will lose something crucial too | Frances RyanRead moreWhen Starmer rowed back on the winter fuel allowance, saying he would look again at making more pensioners eligible,he in effect pulled the curtain back in Oz. The illusion that thisLabourgovernment (and many others) rely on – that there is no money, that inequality is inevitable, that even the worst suffering cannot be eased – disappeared in a puff of smoke. If there is cash to keep pensioners warm in winter, why aren’t there ways to raise funds to do the same for children? If the winter fuel U-turn came after it was cited as a key cause of the local election defeats, are decisions actually based on the economy or electioneering?The facade first slipped a few days earlier, when it emerged thatAngela Rayner urged Rachel Reevesto consider wealth taxes before the spring statement, in a document pointedly entitled “alternative proposals for raising revenue”. This was framed by many in terms of internal tension within Labour – the chancellor on the right of the party in favour of spending cuts to the social safety net v the leftwing deputy prime minister against – but it was really about saying the quiet part out loud. Poverty is a political choice after all.If the “will he, won’t he” surrounding the two-child limit seems drawn out – and it really does – consider it in the context of Starmer’s premiership. Less than a year in office, his inner team appears almost solely focused on re-election in lieu of any vision for the country, as if the point of power is simply to keep it rather than do something with it. The result is an administration lurching from one idea to the next, trying out benefit cuts, migrant bashing, then benefit cut U-turns in the hope that something, anything, sticks.Panicked turnarounds are in many ways the natural end point of governance by spreadsheet, in which a hungry child is not someone’s daughter who needs a hot meal but a statistic on a whiteboard with the heading “GE 2029”.Reports that the child poverty taskforce has recommended bringing back Sure Start but the government is unsure how to fund it shows how this mindset puts a stranglehold on even the most obviously good ideas. That research consistently shows the early years centres – a proven success that thecoalition largely eradicated– actually saved money last time around shows the short-termism and intellectual cowardice behind the “we can’t afford it” mantra.Even the winter fuel change was largely subservience to the status quo. It has long been seen as legitimate in this country for the state to starve a child or degrade a disabled person, but a cardinal sin to take a penny from a pensioner. The same newspapers that had a hernia over the winter fuel allowance will next month cheer ontaking lifeline benefitsfrom disabled people – a move that will notably push another 50,000 children into poverty, along with their disabled and sick parents.This is not to say that many older people do not need more support – the UK state pensionis lowerthan in most other advanced economies relative to average earnings– but that there is an entire political and media ecosystem that decides which groups “deserve” help and which ones don’t. In many ways, Starmer’s biggest mistake was briefly forgetting the rules.There are moments when I wonder how exactly a Labour landslide has come to this. How a government that was elected with gutter-low expectations less than a year ago has, with such efficiency, failed to meet even them. I remember the headlines in recent years about childrensleeping on their bedroom floorbecause they don’t have a bed, orpretending to eat out of an empty lunchboxas they’re ashamed their parents can’t afford a sandwich, and I wonder how this column even needs to be written. A Labour government is in power and we are still debating whether the state should help children who are cold, hungry and dirty.In the meantime, about 100 children are beingpulled below the breadline every dayby the two-child limit alone. If the government delays the child poverty strategy for six months, an estimated 20,000 more infants will be going to bed with hunger pains by Christmas. So, we wait, as we are so used to, and hope at some point there is enough “political capital” for Starmer to feed them.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist.Who Wants Normal?

It is one of many inner London schools facing closure as a result of a 25% drop in under-fours in some boroughs, according to the most recent census. Charlotte Sharman is just around the corner from the site of the Heygate estate, which wasdemolished in 2014and replaced by Elephant Park, a development of thousands of luxury apartments, built by the Australian developer Lendlease. After the Heygate was knocked down, the school roll slumped.Elephant Park, which has won manyawards for “placemaking excellence”, is seen as an exemplar of a new global regeneration industry. In place of lower- and middle-income family housing, the new neighbourhoods are typically created to include luxury apartments set in high-security privatised public space, global retail brands, pop-ups, expensive bars and restaurants, and often a university or art gallery to provide cultural capital.Today, two-bedroom apartments in Elephant Park are on sale for between £900,000 and £1m, and of the 2,704 new homes, only 82 are for social housing. Twenty-five per cent of the new homes are designated “affordable”, but since the government changed the definition of affordable in 2010 to meanup to 80%of market rent or market value, that is financially far out of reach for the majority of Londoners and their families. Alex Mees, who works for the National Education Union and is on the picket line with the protesters, says: “They’ve got rid of family homes in the area and replaced them with one- or two-bedroom apartments – all the families are moving out, they should have seen this coming.”The regeneration of so many new districts, from King’s Cross to the Olympic Park, is part of a larger story of the extreme gentrification of cities like London where soaring house prices are leading directly to a decline in birthrates. Astudy by the Affordable Housing Commissionfound that 13% of British adults under the age of 45 and in a couple delayed or chose not to start a family because of their housing situation – with nearly 2 million people potentially affected. But the decline is much starker in cities such as London, which are experiencing the most extreme gentrification: research showed that while the capital’s overall population is rising, the numbers between the age of 25–39, the typical age of housebuying and family formation, has recentlydropped by 4%, with London Councils, the body representing the city’s 32 boroughs, attributing it to the shortage of family housing.View image in fullscreenDeal in Kent has been dubbed ‘Hackney on Sea’ thanks to the influx of millennials from London to the area.Photograph: Richard Milnes/AlamyThe knock-on effects are that across the south-east, millennials are leaving London for Bristol, Brighton and seaside towns along the south coast, such as Hastings, Eastbourne or Deal. The trend for families to leave the capital is pushing up house prices in these areas and is often far from welcome, spawning the derogatory acronym DFL (Down from London), while Deal has been branded “Hackney on Sea”.Fernanda, an architect and mother of two who lives in Hackney, described how it’s not just schools, but GP surgeries and small businesses – what she calls the “ecosystem of the city” – that are closing. “It is getting emptier and emptier and there is a clear change in demographics happening in front of our eyes,” she says, telling me that she has been invited to two farewell picnics in the next few weeks. “One family bought a house in Nottingham and another family are moving to Kent. It’s mostly people with younger kids because they’re all piled up in a small flat – my son’s class is not full.”The positive rhetoric and branding of placemaking is that it transforms run-down areas into vibrant and economically successful parts of the city. The reality is that it creates sterile places, emptied of so many of the essential aspects of urban life, except the expensive activities. The city may be emptier than ever of children and families, but tables at sought-after restaurants are still booked up weeks in advance. Another category able to stay put are older people,with the census findingthat the proportion of the population in every age group over 50 (except for 80-84 year olds) increased, as many of these people bought property in another era, unwittingly benefiting from huge rises in property values of up to 700%. Today, London boroughs like Southwark and Hackney are a mix of new half-empty neighbourhoods of luxury apartments, round the corner from streets of multimillion pound Georgian and Victorian homes that have soared in value alongside cramped and unaffordable private rental accommodation and a fast declining amount of social housing.The dictionary definition of sterile is “not able to produce children or young” and children are the canary in the coalmine for what is happening to our cities. When the city is no longer able to cater to children, or the range of other diverse uses that keep communities healthy and vibrant, places don’t die, but neither are they truly alive.Anna Minton is the author of Big Capital: Who isLondonfor?

I can hear the hollow laughter from here.Research from the London School of Economicsfound that more than a third of meetings are considered unproductive, which seems awfully low to anyone who has been to a meeting, ever.“People throw meetings at problems,” Priya Parker, meeting specialist and author ofThe Art of Gathering, lamented on theFixable podcastrecently, before offering her solution. Asked for a quick fix, she suggested kicking off with “a magical question”: one that everyone would be interested in answering and in hearing others answer. Her suggestion: “What was your first ever concert, and who took you?”I’ve spoken to Parker and found her exceptionally impressive. But this seems like madness. Wouldn’t a round of prolonged reminiscences about first Glastos and bad dates (or in my case, slightly eccentrically, Everything But the Girl in Harrogate with my mum’s colleague’s husband, Andrew) add a minimum of 10 minutes to even the smallest gathering? Aren’t we all just desperate to get it over with?I’ve been living each day as if it were my first – and the results amazed me | Emma BeddingtonRead moreBut with my life mercifully meeting-free these days, perhaps I’m missing the nuances of 2025 meeting etiquette. I enlisted my husband to test this out at his daily team meeting and listened in, clipboard (OK, coffee) in hand. His colleagues seemed a little startled but played along, and the answers were fun: from some very unexpected metalheads to a 15-year-old punk being dragged along to Kool & the Gang to impress a girl. To my ears, the remainder of the meeting sounded exactly like it always does (loudly conducted in what I usually refer to as “business Martian”), but afterwards my spouse claimed it went well.If you’re tempted, Parker offers other magical question ideas onher Instagram, including “When was the last time you blew up a balloon by yourself? What was the event?” and “What’s the weirdest thing you have ever found in your pocket?” But I reckon the cartoonist Sam Lau had a better idea in her New Yorker cartoon with the taglineHow to run short & effective meetings: it’s three people gathered around a laptop, all doing planks.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsWork & careersOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

It is about battling those who want to take us backwardsMon 26 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 05.30 EDTShareYesterday, I led a private memorial service at ​George Floyd’s graveside​, along with his family, in Houston, Texas. Once that was over, we visited the housing project where Floyd and his siblings grew up.Half a decade after Floydwas taken from them, they were keen, as are we, to ensure his life and legacy will not be forgotten – and to remind the world why the fight for police accountability continues.He died in front of the entire world. Everyone saw the phone footage of the incident where a white officer in Minneapolis kneeled on Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes as he repeatedly said “I can’t breathe”, and cried out for his mother. His desperate pleas for help were ignored by those sworn to serve and protect the public; but they were heard in every corner of the globe.The movement for police reform gained renewed fire, and people from all walks of life demanded systemic change and the protection of Black lives. Five years later, while the officer convicted of Floyd’s murderis behind bars, the current climate in the US and regressive actions from those in power have set us back and prevented substantive police accountability.Just a few days shy of this sombre fifth anniversary, Donald Trump’s department of justice announced thatit would back awayfrom cases to force reforms on police departments – including in Louisville, Kentucky, and in Minneapolis, the city where Floyd was killed. This outrageous decision is not a surprise; it is just the latest roadblock in the fight for police reform and justice. It is an insult to the mothers, fathers, children and loved ones of all those killed at the hands of law enforcement. The consent decrees and small incremental changes that were achieved after tireless advocacy, organising, protests and political courage have been dismantled by a department that should be protecting the civil rights of individuals, not eliminating them.This move isn’t just a policy reversal. It’s a moral retreat that sends a chilling message that accountability is optional when it comes to Black and Brown victims. Trump is shamelessly weaponising the justice department against marginalised communities. The decision to dismiss these lawsuits with prejudice solidifies a dangerous political precedent that police departments are above scrutiny. The timing is no coincidence; it is an insult to Floyd’s family and the loved ones of victims such asSandra Bland,Tyre Nichols,Breonna Taylor,Eric Garnerand countless others whose names we may never even know.View image in fullscreenBridgett Floyd, sister of George Floyd, speaks outside the Lincoln Memorial during the Commitment March in Washington DC, 28 August 2020.Photograph: Chris Tuite/ImageSpace/Rex/ShutterstockI remember delivering the eulogies for Floyd (one in Minneapolis and one in his native Houston) like it was yesterday. There was so much frustration, anger, disgust and exhaustion permeating throughout the US and, in turn, in many nations across the world. In fact, his death sparked global protests against racial injustice, particularly at the hands of law enforcement. Many young people mobilised and hit the streets for the first time, and more than 200,000 folks joined us in the nation’s capital for amarch on Washingtonin August 2020 to call attention to ongoing police injustice. Despite a pandemic, hundreds of thousands from all races, ages and socioeconomic backgrounds protested alongside my organisation,National Action Network(NAN), as we led this march through the streets of Washington.‘We’re going backwards’: Black Lives Matter’s Nekima Levy Armstrong on Trump’s US and the murder of George FloydRead moreMuch has changed. In the wake of Floyd’s killing, and amid calls to respect Black lives, many corporations made commitments to continue diversifying and investing in our communities. Now we are watching many of those same companiesturn their backson their own diversity, equity and inclusion policies, capitulating to a rightwing government. The 2021 conviction of Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed Floyd, represented one of the first major cases in which someone in law enforcement was held accountable for their actions. But now some conservative groupsand individualsare pushing for Chauvin to receive a pardon from the president. Such action would be the height of throwing salt into an already achingly deep wound. It should not be entertained for a moment.Some (particularly those in power at the moment) would like to distort reality and act as though police brutality and misconduct aren’t current problems. Nothing could be further from the truth. According toMapping Police Violence, police in the US have killed 456 people so far this year (as of 23 May). In fact, there has only beena single daywhen police haven’t killed a person in 2025. And as it highlights, Black people are 2.8 times more likely to be killed by law enforcement than their white counterparts. This is why we still march, this is why we still put pressure on elected officials and corporations.For several months, NAN and I have been leading “buy-cotts” to support businesses such as Costco who remain firm in their DEI commitments. I have had meetings with PepsiCo’s chair and the CEO of PepsiCo North America, as well as Target’s CEO. Recently, I joined fellow leaders of national civil rights organisations for a meeting with top Google executives. And on 28 August, NAN will lead a march on Wall Street to defend DEI, remind corporations of their own promises in the wake of Floyd’s death, and reiterate that we will only spend our dollars where we are respected.When I stood in front of mourners five years ago at Floyd’s funeral, I said that his story has been the story of Black people, because the reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed of being is because society kept its knee on our neck. Well, just as we loudly proclaimed around the world then, we say it again, remembering George Floyd, remembering all the victims: get your knee off our necks.

The swift restraining order comes as a relief. But it is no cause for complacency.Attacks will not stop, and it is naive to think that this is all primarily a Harvard problem, or even only a challenge to higher education.Noem’s letter to Harvardmakes clear that Trump and his sycophants will weaponize the state against anyone who incurs their displeasure. Courts may prevent the worst, but the whole pattern has to end if we want to have any hope of living in a country free of fear and featuring at least minimum respect for the rule of law.As Harvard’slawsuit against the Department of Homeland Securityrightly pointed out, Noem’s revocation fits into the Trump administration’s orgy of vengeance prompted by Harvard’s refusal to comply with evidently illegal demands issued in mid-April. Among other things, Trumpistshad assertedtheir right to determine appropriate levels of “viewpoint diversity” among faculty and students. After Harvard sued, $2.2bn in research funds were frozen, followed by Linda McMahon, the education secretary, asserting at a cabinet meeting on 30 April that Harvard was failing to report “foreign money that comes in”. This line of attack has now been extended with absurd claims that Harvard “coordinates with the Chinese Communist Party” and is somehow “pro-terrorist”.The background noise to the official letters has been a steady stream of social media posts from the president, throwing invective at Harvard instead of conducting the serious government business of maligning Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift. The founder ofa university whose attendees received a $25m settlementhas accused the US’s oldest university of “scamming the public”, constituting a “threat to democracy”, and exposing innocent young Americans to “crazed lunatics” (as opposed to non-crazed lunatics). It is a well-known pattern in authoritarian regimes that underlings try to please the leader by anticipating his wishes and imitating his style. Official letters, posts, and press statements from DHS and the Department of Education not only fail to provide evidence and violate procedural safeguards; they not only make up ad hoc demands that have no basis in law; they also contain the signature capital letters, spelling mistakes, and kindergarten-level invective familiar from the president’s rhetoric. It is governance driven by a desire to please Fox viewers, online Maga mobs, and the Avenger-in-Chief.Incompetence hardly makes the measures harmless. They instill fear even when courts step in (and no, not all Ivy League undergrads are spoilt kids who never have anything to fear). Noem, in a further escalation, demanded footage and audio from all protests at Harvard. It is a clear signal for young people to shut up and fall in line. But there was also a signal to foreign faculty: the letter emphasized that it was a “privilege to employ aliens on campus”. The threat aligns withthe nativism of xenophobe-in-chief Stephen Miller, who is not just going after people who are in the country without proper paperwork – foreigners as such are a problem.But Noem’s rhetoric also aligned withthe logic of authoritarian populist leaderswho claim uniquely to represent what they call “the real people”: even citizens will not be free from the accusation by Trump and his sycophants that they are not proper Americans. Trump, at the April 30th cabinet meeting,declared: “The students they have, the professors they have, the attitude they have, is not American.” And Noem made it clear in her letter that her weaponization of the state will not be confined to campus; she wrote that the “evils of anti-Americanism” have to be rooted out in “society” at large.We can draw larger lessons from this – so far – failed attack (eight investigations, involving six different agencies, are still ongoing). One has to be ready – Harvard’s lawyers clearly were. Universities have to stand with each other; Noem warned all of them that they have to “get their act together” or else. Not least, university leaders have to explain to a larger public how Trumpists, in an unprecedented spree of national self-destruction, are busy preventing cancer cures, damaging American soft power, and killing one of the country’s major exports, namely higher education.As with so many other Trump policies, the assault on universities is actually not popular. Even after years of journalists and some professors priming people to think that campus is controlled by woke commissars and “Marxist maniacs” (Trump’s expression – I am still looking for them in the Economics Department),a clear majority of Americansdisapprove of Trump’s approach to higher education. Conservatives have stoked resentment of “liberal eggheads” for decades, but when their children get sick, they will still want to have access to the best medical schools; no parents wants their kids, away at college, to becomepawns– as the Harvard Crimson put it – in political games and subject to an administration’s caprice.

He needed a knee reconstruction and the idea was for him to return in early December. That was before he sustained nerve damage to a tendon during the procedure.“After the operation, I couldn’t lift my foot or my toes,” Milner said. “December 31 was the first time I saw any flicker of life. It [the complication] wasn’t age-related. It was just a bit of bad luck – one in however many thousand.“There was a chance I might not have come back at all. I didn’t know whether I could walk properly again let alone play football. I don’t think many people would have come back from this. The medical staff have been incredible, Sean Duggan [the Brighton physiotherapist] has been absolutely unbelievable. We worked hard and the hard work’s paid off. To be part of it on the pitch again made it all worthwhile.”Milner was asked whether any medics had told him he might have to retire. “Nobody said quit the game,” he replied. “There were obviously doubts from some people that I would get back but nobody said quit it. Not many people have had this and with my age it was highly unlikely I would get back. But I think that was one of the things that drove me most.”Milner turns 40 in January and he is determined to have an impact next season in what would be his 24th in the Premier League. This time out, he became the first player to play in 23 seasons in the competition. He made his debut for Leeds as a 16-year-old at West Ham in November 2002.“I would like to keep playing,” he said. “I’ve definitely got another year left in me. We’re in talks with the club and quite close so it will be nice to be here and be part of the team and help the boys.”Explore more on these topicsBrighton & Hove AlbionnewsShareReuse this content"

Such a model “disincentivises ethical conduct”, the letter says, and “precludes effective internal reform”.Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, promised widespread changes to the body’s practices when he was elected into the role following the Baur au Lac arrests and theresignation of the former presidentSepp Blatter. “We enter now a new era,” Infantino said in 2016. “We’ll restore the image of Fifa and make sure everybody will be happy with what we do.”Instead, in 2025 there is ­discontent among stakeholders and outside observers over the way the world’s most popular sport is being run. “It is time to recognise that these reforms have failed to usher in a new era of responsible governance at Fifa and that the organisation is structurally unfit to govern world football,” the letter reads. “Fifa is arguably more poorly governed today than it was 10 years ago.”The letter goes on to cite the Club World Cup this summer and its impact on the fixture calendar, the decision to grant the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia despite the country’s human rights abuses and the ­opacity of executive decision making, as examples of concerning trends.“This statement demonstrates not only the rank failure of the reforms enacted under the presidency of Gianni Infantino, but also the breadth of expert opposition to and frustration with Fifa’s dysfunctional ­governance model,” said Nick McGeehan, the co-director of human rights advocacy group FairSquare, which coordinated the letter.Bonita Mersiades, one of a group of whistleblowers to expose malfeasance in Fifa in the previous decade, said the culture had not changed in the intervening years. “I was on the inside during the Blatter era, where wrongdoing was out in the open and the need for reform was not understood and certainly not welcome,” said Mersiades, a signatory to the letter. “The 2015 raids were a reckoning. But 10 years on, while there may be process and policy in place under Gianni Infantino, the culture remains the same. And when it comes to process versus culture, culture wins every time. True reform demands more than new systems – it requires new values. We’re not there yet.”In a statement a Fifa spokesperson said: “A few weeks ago, the very same authorities that had to intervene [against] Fifa in 2015 – the US attorney general and FBI director – travelled to our offices in Miami, to meet Fifa leadership and work together as a highly respected partner.“The 2015 scandal marked a ­turning point for the organisation, allowing a new Fifa to emerge. Thanks to the intervention of the US authorities back in 2015, we have been able to fundamentally change Fifa from a toxic organisation at the time, to a respected and trusted global sports governing body focusing on its ­mandate to develop football all around the world.”Fifa points to internal reforms around financial governance, positive assessments by the Association of Summer Olympic Federations as to their transparency and good governance, and a sevenfold increase in investment in football development around the world as among the positive changes made by the organisation in the past decade.Explore more on these topicsFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Arsenal, the new champions of Europe, were given a heroes’ welcome in north London two daysafter their stunning victoryover Barcelona in the Champions League final.The scenes in Armoury Square, outside the Emirates Stadium, were reminiscent of those in Trafalgar Squarethe day after the Lionesses liftedtheir maiden European title in 2022, or those in the same N5 location when the Arsenal men’s team lifted the FA Cup in 2014 and 2015 (the 2017 occasion was cancelled by the Metropolitan police due to security risks in London, and Covid restrictions prevented a public celebration in 2020).In terms of women’s club football, in England, no trophy jamboree comes close to matching it. This was a celebration not ofArsenal Womenbut of Arsenal and the fruits of a long-term one‑club project were evident in the numbers that showed up less than 48 hours after the historic 1-0 defeat of Barcelona in Lisbon on Saturday evening.Steph Catley, the centre-back who anchored a phenomenal full‑team defensive effort alongside Leah Williamson, said moments after coming off the stage: “I had an idea in my head of what it would look like, but it didn’t equate to that. That was very special and something I’m so proud to be a part of.”View image in fullscreenArmoury Square was packed with thousands of fans as Arsenal celebrated their Champions League victory with a trophy lift outside the Emirates Stadium.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAIt had been short notice for the celebrations and some fans had turned up at 6am to get a prime position at the front of the barriers. Catley said: “It says everything. They always show up for us … as a female footballer, you look at Arsenal and you want to play there. You’ve got the support and everything you need. There are world-class players, but the fans make it so special. To bring them a trophy and thank them for their support is the best.”Williamson said: “You look at the turnout today and you think about what we’ve done over the last couple of years, how we’ve positioned ourselves and how the club have positioned us in terms of a respect point of view. Then to contribute to that with a trophy win, it feels like we did our bit. The work that’s been done behind the scenes for the last couple of years is world leading. Now there’s a trophy to match that and I’m very proud of that. This is the stuff that makes you stay and want to come back.”0:41Arsenal Women and Crystal Palace celebrate victory across London – videoThe trophies have been the missing piece, two League Cup wins in 2023 and 2024 not enough to satisfy the demands of the most decorated women’s team in England. “You have to win trophies, you have to,” Williamson said. “I’m so proud of what we do off the pitch, who we are, how we lead and how we carry ourselves, I’m so proud of that but I want to win and Arsenal should be winning.“I’ve looked at that legacy all my life and I wanted to contribute to it. I didn’t want to end my career just being loyal. Loyalty is great but loyalty with trophies is just something else. This week I’ve spoken to Tony Adams and Thierry Henry, people I watched, they were incredible and they won and that’s why they are remembered the way they are.”Fans were treated to speeches from the head coach,Renée Slegers, Williamson, Stina Blackstenius, scorer of the winning goal in Lisbon, and a very merry Katie McCabe before the trophy was brought on stage by two Arsenal in the Community participants, 11‑year‑old Daisy Martin and seven‑year‑old Celine Davie. Then the songs and dancing began and a relaxed Win the dog was momentarily lofted in the air by Beth Mead and Slegers to the delight of fans below.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, they have spent big too, the money invested in everything around the final – from the hotels and travel to the parties and Emirates Stadium celebrations – far exceeding the €350,000 (£293,000) prize pot for the winners, which is added to the money accrued throughout the tournament.For Williamson, a lifelong Arsenal fan who was a mascot when the team lifted a first European title in 2007 – the stadium facade behind the celebrations providing a fitting tribute to that side – it has been an extremely emotional bank holiday weekend.“I always said: ‘Trophy for England over trophy for Arsenal,’” she said. “Because, I just think you don’t pick your country, it’s a bit more of a fate thing, a bit more luck needs to be involved. But I feel ashamed now, because that feeling on Saturday was, I think right now, the happiest I’ve ever been in my whole entire life and I hope that other Arsenal fans are happy too.

I’ve watched every bit of footage so it lives as long as possible in my memory. Then I’ve been connecting with loads of people, like Tessa Payne, she was my under-10s coach, my first coach, I’ve wanted to reconnect with all those old faces, those people that have seen the journey over the years and the people that know how much I love Arsenal and know how much this would mean to me whether I was on the pitch or not.”Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenWomen's footballWomen's Champions LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

As he reflected on his time working with Murray, Djokovic insisted that their decision to part ways was mutual.French Open: US shocks as top-10 seeds Fritz and Navarro lose in first roundRead more“He did congratulate me [on winning Geneva], and he said: ‘Now that you have a proper coach, you’re winning tournaments,’” said Djokovic, laughing. “I don’t know. I didn’t take that as a joke. Of course he was joking, but I think I have said enough, but I will say it again: Andy is just an amazing person. First of all, someone that I have spent most of my career with since the very young age on the tour, travelling, playing him, facing him in the earliest days, under-12 and all the way through to the last days of his career. For him to join my team and for us to give a shot to this player/coach relationship was really an incredible thing for tennis and for both of us. I was very privileged and honoured.”Djokovic continued: “I feel like we have a closer relationship because of our working relationship in the last four, five months.”As Djokovic prepared for his first-round match against Mackenzie McDonald, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner took their first steps forward with straight-set victories in Paris. Alcaraz, the second seed and defending champion, described himself as pleasantly surprised by his level as he eased through with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 win over Giulio Zeppieri of Italy. In the evening session, the top-seeded Sinner held off a late surge from home favourite Arthur Rinderknech in an electric atmosphere on Court Philippe-Chatrier to close out a 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 win. Sinner has now won 15 consecutive grand slam matches after winning the US Open and Australian Open.Sinner’s victory sets up a significant second-round match with Richard Gasquet, the 38-year-old veteran and former world No 7 who is competing in his final tournament this week. Gasquet, who has been a constant presence in the sport for more than two decades since he emerged on the tour as a teenage prodigy, defeated his fellow French wildcard Terence Atmane 6-2, 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 to advance.Taylor Fritz, the fourth seed, was thefirst significant casualtyin the men’s draw as he was defeated 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 by Daniel Altmaier of Germany, ending a bitter clay court season marred by earlier injury struggles.Elsewhere, a tearful Naomi Osaka briefly halted her press conference after suffering another heartbreaking loss in a significant tournament, losing 6-7 (1), 6-1, 6-4 to the 1oth seed, Paula Badosa. Despite some promising results, Osaka has struggled to rediscover her old form since returning to the sport after giving birth to her daughter, Shai, last January. She has reached the third round of a grand slam tournament on only one occasion since her return and when she did so at the Australian Open this year, she was forced to retire due to injury.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Efforts to enliven the race with mandatory pit stops fell flat on Sunday.McLaren’sLando Norris won in Monte Carloand was, despite the two pit-stop rule, in control throughout. Only two passes were made on track in 78 laps and drivers including Red Bull’s Max ­Verstappen, who ­finished fourth, and Mercedes’ George ­Russell, who was 11th, dismissed the rule change as all but pointless.‘We were almost doing Mario Kart’: Verstappen and Russell slate Monaco F1 GP pit stopsRead moreChristian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, believed the most important change required was to alter the layout to create one area where overtaking was at least feasible.“The ­fundamental problem is you cannot overtake here,” he said. “The cars are so big now that you just don’t have a chance to get alongside. It’s circuit specific, we’ve known that, it’s been on the calendar for 72 years. Everything has to move with the times ultimately.“It’s an iconic and historic circuit but if you look at how Monaco has changed, how much land they’ve reclaimed into the sea, I don’t think you’d need to do too much. There just needs to be one area where you can have an overtake and everybody knows that coming here the race was pretty much done on Saturday. We’ve introduced another dynamic with the pit stop, which, ultimately for the top 10, other than the retirement, nobody really changed position.”The race was marked by the ­leading teams matching each other through the pit stops and the absence of a safety car or red flag to bring an element of chance into ­proceedings. ­Further back, teams applied teamwork between drivers to ­create pit window gaps that involved ­deliberately driving slowly to the infuriation of others who were left impotent in a train on track. Very few were satisfied with the outcome.Norris said it had created jeopardy by the risk of mere fortune deciding the result rather than in the form of actual racing. “There’s not been any more overtaking here. I thought that was what was wanted,” he said. “Now you just give people opportunity by luck, by waiting for a red flag, waiting for a safety car. You aren’t getting a more deserved winner in the end of things.”The race organiser, the ­Automobile Club de Monaco, believes changing the track layout is next to ­impossible but Norris’s team principal, Andrea Stella, suggested it was worth ­bringing into the equation. “We should praise that Formula One and the FIA made an attempt to improve racing,” he said. “The main limitation remains the fact that you cannot overtake and this is quite structural as a limitation. I am not sure exactly how this can be modified just simply by imposing a certain number of pit stops.“I’m not sure there’s anything that can be done from a track layout point of view. I’ve never thought of this aspect but maybe there’s something that we should consider.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He suggested ­imposing a minimum lap time could be ­feasible to prevent driving ­unnecessarily slowly and discussing altering the layout with the organisers.“What we can look at is to create some more specific regulations that there’s a maximum of back-off you can have,” he said. “Does it improve the overtaking?

Two dozen non-runners from an original total of 90 declared runners, almost all of which were due to the good-to-firm going, left the card as a whole looking distinctly threadbare.The biggest hit was to the initial 15-runner field for a 10-furlong handicap, with a £10k prize to the winner, which ended up with just six starters are eight ground-related scratchings and another due to a bad scope.Bank holiday crowds are a lifeline for plenty of the country’s smaller tracks. It is – and there is no shame in it – a case of never mind the quality, feel the width. The paying punters do not expect to see next year’s Derby winner running in the novice but they do expect excitement and a spectacle. On that basis, the depleted fields at Windsor on Monday were not a good look.It is a look, though, that promises to become increasingly familiar, at least if Charlie Rees, Windsor’s clerk of the course, is correct. “I think it’s just a sign of the times, really,” Rees told the Racing Post. “Trainers are obviously desperate for a bit of cut in the ground for certain horses and unfortunately the promised rain we were once forecast hasn’t delivered.”Rees had watered the track in the run-up to Monday’s card and it was officially good when the course raced on Saturday evening – and reported as good, good-to-soft in places at 7am on Saturday morning – but no rainfall and strong winds combined to dry it out to good-to-firm in 48 hours.The British Horseracing Authority’s general instructions to racecourses state that Flat tracks “should aim to provide good-to-firm ground”, but that description has become an increasing rarity in British Flat racing over the last 20 years, as clerks of the course have turned on the taps with increasing regularity and persistence. While 46% of Flat races in the 2005 season were run on good-to-firm going or faster, by 2024 the figure was down to just 29%.Over jumps, meanwhile, the BHA instruction is that tracks “should aim to provide good ground, and no firmer than good-to-firm.” The extent to which officials have taken this to heart is evident from the fact that just 31 National Hunt races were run on good-to-firm ground in 2024 (and eight of those were at meetings staged in mid-November).The primary welfare issue around the speed of the ground has always been seen as the rate of fatal and serious injuries to runners, and the statistics leave no doubt that racing on good-to-firm ground, over jumps in particular, has a higher fatality rate than competing on an easier surface.On the Flat, meanwhile, while the fatality rate is much lower overall – just 0.09% in 2024, representing 55 fatal injuries from 59,194 starts – but the chance of a minor injury or issue – getting “jarred-up”, for instance – is also higher on faster ground.So good-to-firm ground will remain a sticking point for many owners and trainers, despite being the BHA’s official “target” for racecourses, and while Windsor’s depleted card on Monday is still a relative rarity, in the medium-to-long term, as global temperatures are predicted to creep ever higher and water becomes an increasingly precious – and therefore expensive – resource, the clerks can expect to be fighting a losing battle.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowLeicester:2.00 Rock On Thunder 2.30 Bust A Moon 3.00 Pina Sonata 3.30 Me Tarzan 4.00 Sixteen One 4.35 Antelope (nb) 5.10 Dashing Donkey.Redcar:2.20 Bleep Test 2.50 Captain Brett 3.20 Mafting 3.50 Jet Black 4.20 Poet’s Dawn 4.55 Bantz 5.25 Four Adaay.Brighton:2.40 Danehill Star 3.10 Senorita Vega 3.40 Twilight Guest 4.10 Oj Lifestyle 4.45 Callout (nap) 5.15 Pop Dancer.Wolverhampton:6.12 Bone Marra 6.42 Cajole 7.12 The Feminine Urge 7.42 Wyvern 8.12 Latin 8.42 Tralee Girl.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Smaller tracks in particular could start to find that maintaining an acceptable racing surface – or acceptable to the majority of trainers and owners, at any rate – is no longer economically viable.The sport is currently spending £3.62m on a marketing campaign to attract a fresh new generation of fans, the results of which remain to be seen. Future-proofing the sport to ensure the racegoers of 2035 and beyond have something to watch, however, promises to be an even sterner challenge.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingTalking HorsesHorse racing tipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When the two buses carrying Oliver Glasner and his FA Cup winners rounded the corner of Holmesdale Road, red and blue smoke from flares filled the air as thousands of south Londoners showed their appreciation, with several shedding tears again.In the days since Eberechi Eze’swinner against Manchester Cityclinched Palace’s first major trophy, a sense of disbelief has been the overwhelming feeling for fans who are excitedly contemplating a foray into Europe next season.“This has been the best week of my life to share this with all these guys,” said an emotional Steve Parish, Palace’s chair. “Our fans are our superpower – that is what we’ve got that drives us forward.”View image in fullscreenFans in the packed streets around Selhurst Park greet the buses carrying the Crystal Palace players and staff.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAmbitious plans to host the parade in Crystal Palace Park – the club’s former home and where the Cup final was played between 1895 and 1914 – had failed to come to fruition. Croydon council’s chief executive denied rumours it had demanded £200,000 to host the celebrations in the borough, while neighbouring Bromley council revealed it had suggested a parade from the training ground in Beckenham via the park and then the stadium, but Palace “did not feel able to proceed in the time available with their ideas, given concerns raised by a range of organisations”.The result was a slimmed down route you could usually walk in about five minutes but it took Joel Ward, Marc Guéhi and co the best part of an hour to complete.0:41Arsenal Women and Crystal Palace celebrate victory across London – videoEven a downpour of rain as the buses made their way along Whitehorse Lane could not dampen the spirits, with 7,000 fans then piling on to the pitch at Selhurst Park to continue the celebrations that included a DJ set by Sister Bliss from Faithless, whose singer Maxi Jazz was a vice-president at Palace before his death in 2022.“I’ve been dancing all day,” said the French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta when he was called up onstage to collect his goal of the season award for his lob against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.View image in fullscreenJean-Philippe Mateta dons some suitable specs as he celebrates at the party on the pitch.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianWith planning permission having been granted last summer for a new stand that would take the stadium’s capacity to 34,000, work was expected to finally begin in the coming weeks but spiralling costs have caused further delays. It is estimated they could reach up to £240m.Uncertainty over the club’s ownership is another hurdle Parish must resolve, but holding on to Glasner, whose contract expires at the end of next season, will be his main priority, not to mention a number of players who are coveted by bigger clubs including Guéhi, Mateta and the Wembley hero Eze.“We couldn’t hope for a better group,” Parish said when he addressed the exultant crowd on the pitch. “To smash through the glass ceiling for this club and finally win something – their names will go down in history. They will always be loved here.”View image in fullscreenA tinfoil FA Cup had to make an appearance.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAsked what Glasner has done for Palace since taking over from Roy Hodgson as manager last February, he said: “Oliver doesn’t like coming second.

We need to deliver for the manager in the close season and the fans.”The Austrian has made a habit of winning trophies wherever he has been and has seemed to take Palace’s victory in his stride despite allowing himself to relax on a staff trip to Ibiza aftertheir midweek win against Wolves.View image in fullscreenA sign honours Eberechi Eze’s cup final contribution.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianGlasner showed his ruthless side during the final match of the seasonagainst Liverpool on Sundaywhen he took off Romain Esse after the £12m January signing from Millwall had been brought on as a substitute and later criticised his attitude. He was in far more relaxed mood on Monday and stressed the importance of maintaining their progress next season.“Today is a good moment to talk about [our achievements]. Yesterday, after the game, maybe not,” he said. “I couldn’t be more pleased to work with a group of players.

While Sporting won the Primeira Liga title without Amorim, United have fallen down the table to 15th since the Portuguese took the reins from the interim coach, Ruud van Nistelrooy. Much of the ire towards United has been directed at the owners but on the pitch Amorim has failed to adapt his squad of expensive, experienced internationals into anything approaching a cohesive unit. TheEuropa League final defeat by Tottenhamshowed how much work is left to do.Those defending Amorim will point out he has not got the personnel to fit his preferred 3-4-3 (althoughthe £25m January signing Patrick Dorguhas largely been underwhelming), that he has not had a pre-season to train his players properly and that United’s run to the Europa League final mitigates their league performances. After more than six months of underachievement, none of this really stacks up.Federico ChiesaTo be this bad in a team this good has been an impressive feat for Federico Chiesa. That the 27-year-old was given his first Premier League start only this month against Brighton, when Liverpool had wrapped up the title, shows what little faith Arne Slot has had in the Italian. “He did even more than I can expect from him,” said Slot, somewhat awkwardly, after that visit to the Amex, when Chiesa spluttered as a false 9, lacking the physicality to play centrally, miscontrolling simple passes out for throw-ins and miskicking the only shot he attempted. Injury and fitness issues plagued the first part of Chiesa’s season but he has not done enough to deserve more minutes. The Italian’s ACL injury in 2022 has taken a physical and mental toll. Juventus obviously knew something the rest of us didn’t whenthey sold him for £10mlast summer.View image in fullscreenFederico Chiesa barely featured during Liverpool’s march to the title.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty ImagesThe three promoted/relegated sides (again)This is the second successive season when the three promoted sides have been relegated. There is a wider systemic issue about the growing gulf between the top two tiers but Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton are not without blame. Southampton, having gained promotionin the playoff final, narrowly avoided registering the lowest Premier League points total; the club’s failure to realise that Russell Martin’s expansive tactics were not compatible with the lack of Premier League quality and nous in the squad was fatal and their appointment of Ivan Juric a disaster.Similarly at Leicester, managerial changes disrupted their season: they were disappointed to see Enzo Maresca join Chelsea after winning the Championship but were outside the relegation zone whenSteve Cooper was sackedin November. The board must shoulder most of the responsibility alongside whoever greenlitthe £20m move for Oliver Skipp(no significant injuries but seven league starts before Leicester’s relegation was confirmed; no goals, no assists). That Ipswich spent more than £120m on signings and finished above only Saints is not a great look, with only Liam Delap looking likely to return any sort of profit on those investments. The pressure will be on Ipswich to bounce straight back but they will be buoyed that most of the squad and Kieran McKenna look likely to stay.Chelsea left-wingersNo, this isn’t a critique of a sudden outbreak of champagne socialism in west London but an appraisal of Chelsea’s remarkable ability to collect a litany of expensive and woefully ineffective superstars on their left flank. There are few with more raw talent than João Félix or Jadon Sancho but they have been ineffective at best and dire at their worst. Both are 25 and supposedly in their prime but Félix registered one goal and one assist in 12 Premier League games before being bumped offon loan to Milanin February – less than six months after signing on a seven-year contract for about £45m. Although Sancho has lastedthe entirety of his season’s loan, his return of three goals and four assists in 31 league matches isn’t much better. Chelsea will have to pay Manchester United £5m this summer if they opt not to sign Sancho permanently for about £25m, which is quite the decision. It could have been even worse for Chelsea had they not managed to convince Arsenal to take Raheem Sterling on loan. Sterling and Félix will return in the summer and they, along with Christopher Nkunku, leave Chelsea in a bind again over how to deal with their expensive errors of the recent past.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since the end of January, Foden has started six league matches: goalless draws at Southampton and Manchester United, three defeats against Nottingham Forest, Arsenal and Liverpool and a win over Newcastle. He has clearly not been himself andspoke after the FA Cup finalabout playing with ankle pain for the past couple of months and dealing with things off the pitch, saying: “It’s been a frustrating season. I’ve had a lot of things going on off the pitch mentally. Sometimes there’s things in life bigger than football. This season I’ve struggled a little bit.” We wish him a speedy recovery and a return to his best form.

The Manchester United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir slid out to gather the ball. He fumbled, slightly, allowing Morgan Rogers to poke the ball away from him. The referee Thomas Bramall thought Bayindir had had the ball under control and blew for a free-kick just before Rogers knocked the ball into the empty net. Replays showed decisively that Bayindir never had the ball under control. But because Bramall had stopped the game before Rogers put the ball over the line, the goal could not be given by the video assistant referee.Three minutes later, Amad Diallo put United ahead, his team went on to win, and Villa finished sixth in the Premier League, meaning theyare out of next season’s Champions League. Given how close Villa have pushed the line on Profit & Sustainability Rules (PSR), that could have significant ramifications.Furious Villa to complain over choice of referee for costly defeat at Manchester UnitedRead more“The key moment,” said Unai Emery, “was the goal of Morgan Rogers and how the referee in this moment decided this action”. On Sunday evening, Aston Villasent a letter to the PGMOL, the body that oversees refereeing in the Premier League, protesting that “a more experienced referee” had not been appointed and stating that “a decision to whistle early is clearly inconsistent with current refereeing guidelines”. Which, frankly, from a club that has done so much right in recent seasons, is all a bit embarrassing.Was Bramall’s decision wrong? Yes. Was it an understandable error? Also yes: from Bramall’s (entirely correct) position, 20 yards away, it’s entirely reasonable that he didn’t realise Bayindir hadn’t claimed a simple ball easily, couldn’t see that there was a half inch gap between the ball and the goalkeeper’s glove. There are 17 minutes remaining, the game is becoming increasingly edgy, tempers fraying: he thinks he sees a forward going in slightly late on a goalkeeper and kicking the ball out of his hands, so he blows the whistle. Be decisive, control the moment, try to prevent any flare up before it has begun. Much of that sounds like good refereeing – it’s just that Bayindir had made an inexplicable mistake.And this is where we run into VAR and the contortions into which it has forced the game. Somehow referees are now being asked not merely to decide whether something is a foul, but to assess in the moment how certain they are it is a foul; and, on that assessment, decide whether to blow the whistle immediately or whether to wait so that there is an opportunity to correct a potential mistake. Do we really want more ghost football, football that might be real but everybody suspects isn’t? Taiwo Awoniyi’s horror injuryshould be warning enoughof the danger that presents.This was a classic case of a club blaming a referee for their own shortcomings. Was that really the “key moment” in the game? Or was the key moment the moment just before half-time when Matty Cash underhit a backpass, presenting the ball to Rasmus Højlund, who was then bodychecked by Emi Martínez, earning the goalkeeper an entirely merited red card? And this was Manchester United, a team who have been dreadful all year: maybe if you want to be in the Champions League, just beat them.Villa, of all clubs, should know how refereeing errors can have a major impact, for good or for ill. In 2020, Sheffield United were not awarded a goal against Villa that had clearly crossed the line because bodies in the way meant goalline technology could not function. Without the point that brought Villa, they would have finished below Bournemouth on goal difference and been relegated. Mistakes happen; the key is to put yourself in a position that if they go against you, they don’t matter.The consequences of missing out on the top five could be profound.According to the Swiss Ramble Substack, in the last three-year window, Villa complied with PSR by only £12m – and that only after extending their accounting period by a month to take in the sales of Douglas Luiz, Ian Maatsen and Omari Kellyman. Although this season’s Champions League revenue and the £60m sale of Jhon Durán in January will help, the £100m sale of Jack Grealish to Manchester City will no longer count towards the next calculations, while there was a significant investment, at least in terms of wages, in Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio, in January.Martínez has already been strongly linked with a move to Saudi Arabia, but he may not be the only significant departure this summer as Villa battle to comply with PSR. Swiss Ramble suggests they have probably already breached Uefa’s squad cost control limits, although the sanctions for that are less severe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Democrats should clearly make the case for deficits to work for the peopleMon 26 May 2025 13.08 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 17.22 EDTShareDonald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” budgetsqueakedthrough the US House of Representatives last Thursday – a shiny populist package hiding a brutal class agenda. No taxes ontips! Biggerchild tax credits! But look closer and the bill is a sleight of hand. The middle-class perks expire in 2028 – just asMr Trump’s second termwould end – while permanent tax cuts for the rich, and delayed cuts tomeans-tested welfare, entrench inequality. It’s not a budget. It’s a bait-and-switch. It turns Democrats’ fiscal caution into a liability – one that punishes their ownbase. Republicans understand what Democrats still don’t: deficits aren’t the danger. It’s what you do with them that matters.This bill supercharges inequality:a $1.1tn giveawayto Americans earning more than$500,000a year – funded by pushing poorer families offMedicaidandfood assistance. It slashes green energy subsidies.Expertssay it could add $3.1tn to the debt – but it’s more than millionaire tax breaks. ItraisesImmigration and Customs Enforcement funding by 365% for detention, 500% for deportations – fuel for Mr Trump’s crackdown.It’s also trickle-up economics sold as working‑class salvation. Democrats voting against it now face the optics of opposing “tax relief for waitresses” – even though athirdof such workers make too little to pay income tax and won’t benefit at all. The bill now moves to the Senate, whereRepublicansmust juggle fiscal hawkishness onwelfarewith silence on pro-rich tax cuts – hopingvoterswon’t notice theirhypocrisy. No filibuster looms, but any Senate changes must pass with a simple majority - and then survive the House, where even modest tweaks could alienate hardliners or upset fragile support.But too many Democrats remain trapped by outdated budget dogma. While Republicans rack updeficitsfor the rich, Democrats cling to the Reagan-eraByrd ruleand “pay for” logic – treating a1970s economyas today’s reality. The former is a procedural constraint, but it was born of a political age obsessed with balanced budgets, and it continues to shrink ambition by demanding offsets for moral imperatives. In 2021, the most effectiveanti-child-poverty policyin decades expired because some Democrats fretted over funding it, despiterecordcorporate profits.The US needs to tax thewealthyproperly – not least because rampant inequality is destroying democracy. But the economist Stephanie Kelton is right that thequestionabout deficits isn’t so much “how big?” but “who benefits?” That’s the language Democrats need. Not budget sermons. Deficits should be for public purpose, notprivate plunder. Rather than scare stories about debt, Democrats should say America can run a deficit to fund healthcare, housing and green tech – not to bankroll authoritarian deportation squads or gift cash to the donor class.The real risk isn’t rejecting Mr Trump’s tax‑and‑spend agenda – it’s countering it with arithmetic. Voters don’t want better calculations, they want better convictions. In2021, Joe Biden urgedconservative Democratsto break their addiction to “pay-fors” and embrace a politics of purpose – spending driven by values, not accounting gimmicks. Their refusal is partly why the party struggles with its message today. Mr Trump’s budget may blow up the deficit, but it also blows up the illusion that Democrats can win with numbers. The only way out of the trap is to fight not over how much the federal government spends but whom it spends it on.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS economyRepublicansDemocratsJoe BidenEconomicseditorialsShareReuse this content"

For many, it did. The government’sU-turnon winter fuel payments signalled a welcome retreat. But the deeper shift may lie in the terrain that ministers are now forced to fight on: cuts hitting disabled people and their families. In the Commons, Sir Ed Davey raised the case ofGinny, a carer for her husband with myotonic dystrophy. He described the human burden of responsibility, exhaustion and love. Under the government’s planned cuts, he warned, her family stands to lose £12,000 a year. The prime minister replied with managerial platitudes. Sir Ed, by contrast, spoke of duty, dignity and the very real consequences of policy.The Liberal Democrat leader isn’t trading in ideology; he’s drawing a line based on human decency.Caringhas been a constant theme of his life, even more than politics. When he was a teenager, Sir Ed spent three years looking after hismotherwho died of bone cancer. Later he helped care for the grandmother who brought him up. Every morning at 6am, Sir Ed wakes up his severely disabled 17-year-old son, John, then cleans his teeth, bathes him and gives him his morning massage. In his new book,Why I Care, he frames this both an act of love and a foundational political insight.The Lib Dem leader wants to rewrite British politics – not with the language of crisis, but that of care. In a Westminster hooked on “tough choices” and resistant to compassion in policy, he offers something rare – moral clarity rooted in lived experience. He understands that care is not a luxury to be considered after the economy is “fixed”. It is, he says, the coreeconomy. His new book is both memoir and manifesto, containing a call to abandon parliamentary introspection and recentre politics around mutual support.Critics might call it earnest. Cynics may spy sentiment in search of power. The Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, says Lib Dems are just “good at fixing church roofs”. But Sir Ed leans in. Hispaddle‑boarding,Zumba-thrusting2024 election campaign delivered his party’s best result in a century,winning72 seats – 60 from the Conservatives. The latest YouGovpollinghas his party ahead of the Tories and snapping at Labour’s heels.Rooted in real life and years helping constituents through a broken system, his authority on care is hard-won. The UK has 6 million unpaid carers –1.7 millionwork more than 50 hours a week. The NHS would collapse without them. Yet many carers are met not with help, but hurdles – denied adequate respite and treated as invisible. This paper’sinvestigationinto the scandal over carer’s allowance payments revealed a brutal bureaucracy punishing vulnerable people. It’s not just neglectful. It’s insulting.Sir Ed’s proposal – to assign every family in need a named carer and social worker – is modest, sensible and overdue. He’s also had enough of the care reviews. Who can blame him? Since 1997, there have been 25 commissions, inquiries and white papers. Now ministers wantLouise Caseyto take three more years for a review into adult social care. He says it’s enough to make you cry. Sir Ed’s not point-scoring, just asking how family, community and state can equitably share the load. And urging the government to get on with it – as quietly and steadily as the carers it routinely ignores.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Last week, the Office for National Statistics reporteda larger than expected jump in annual inflation to 3.5% in April. The increase, to the highest rate in more than a year, followed dramatic increases in water bills, energy costs and council tax.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The rare dose of good news, and a further expected reduction expected when Ofgem reassesses the cap again in September, has led some analysts to say this trend should limit the rise in inflation this year.The Bank of England forecast earlier this month that inflation would peak at an average 3.5% over the summer months.Explore more on these topicsInflationRetail industryFood & drink industryEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That valor gave us the freest, greatest and most noble republic ever to exist on the face of the earth,” he said of those killed in military service.Then he went on: “A republic that I am fixing after a long and hard four years. That was a hard four years we went through.”The president continued with ananti-immigrationstatement that chimes withhis agenda, though without directly mentioning his predecessor, Democratic president Joe Biden who served between Trump’s first term and the Republican’s return to the White Housethis January.“Who would let that happen? People pouring through our borders unchecked. People doing things that are indescribable and not for today to discuss,” Trump said.It was a nod to his Truth Social platform on Monday morning wherehe posteda tirade against judges who hold up his deportation aims, chiefly because of his ignoring due process obligations, as “monsters” and again attacked undocumented immigrants, using sweeping disparagements.At Arlington, he added, to cheers from supporters in the crowd: “We will do better than we’ve ever done as a nation, better than ever before. I promise you that.”Drawing attention to airmen lost in a raid over Vietnam and to a soldier lost to a suicide bombing in Iraq, while family members listened to the speech at the cemetery on the outskirts ofWashington DC, Trump said: “These warriors picked up the mantle of duty and service, knowing that to live for others meant always that they might die for others. They asked nothing. They gave everything. And we owe them everything and more.”“The greatest monument to their courage is not carved in marble or cast in bronze – it’s all around us, an American nation 325 million strong, which will soon be greater than it has ever been before,” he said. “It will be.”He also used the solemn occasion to promote the celebration next month of the US army’s 250th anniversary, which he said “blows everything away, including the World Cup and including the Olympics, as far as I’m concerned”.Both events – the soccer World Cup next year, and the next summer Olympics in 2028 – are set to be held in the US within the span of Trump’s second term.Trump said: “We have the World Cup and we have the Olympics. I have everything. Amazing, the way things work out. God did that – I believe that,” he remarked of the timing. He added that “in some ways I’m glad I missed that [consecutive] second term” because then he wouldn’t have been president for these milestones.He then returned to honoring fallen soldiers.Former Harvard president urges people to ‘speak out’ against threats to US democracyRead moreTrump also said on Monday he is considering taking a further $3bn of grant money away from Harvard University and giving it to trade schools across the US, while a former president of Harvard and current professor there, Drew Gilpin Faust,warned thatAmerican freedoms and democracy were at risk.At Arlington,Hegsethreferenced men who sacrificed their lives for the nation but made no reference to women.

It did not look like something that had been used as a hammer or an anvil; it didn’t look like a tool at all.“The stone was oddly shaped and had a red ochre dot, which really caught our eye,” said David Álvarez Alonso, an archaeologist at Complutense University in Madrid.“We were all thinking the same thing and looking at each other because of its shape: we were all thinking, ‘This looks like a face’. But obviously that wasn’t enough. As we carried on our research, we knew we needed information to be able to advance the hypothesis that there was some purposefulness here, this was a symbolic object and that one possible explanation – although we’ll never know for sure – is that this was the symbolisation of a face.”The findings reinforce the idea that Neanderthals were capable of artistic and symbolic creation.Photograph: Álvarez-Alonso et alDetermined to test their conviction that the red mark was a human fingerprint placed deliberately between the indentations that could have been the eyes and mouth of a face, the team enlisted the help of other experts. Further investigations confirmed that the pigment, which contained iron oxides and clay minerals, was not found elsewhere in or around the cave.“We then got in touch with the scientific police to determine whether we were right that the dot had been applied using a fingertip,” said Álvarez Alonso. “They confirmed that it had.” The print, they concluded, was human and could be that of an adult male.“Once we had that and all the other pieces, context and information, we advanced the theory that this could be apareidolia[catching sight of a face in an ordinary, inanimate object] which then led to a human intervention in the form of the red dot,” said the archaeologist. “Without that red dot, you can’t make any claims about the object.”Álvarez Alonso argues that the dot’s existence raises questions that all point in the same direction.“It couldn’t have been a coincidence that the dot is where it is – and there are no markings to indicate any other use,” he said. “So why did they bring this pebble from the river to the inside of the cave? And, what’s more, there’s no ochre inside the cave or outside it. So they must have had to bring pigment from elsewhere.”The team’s findings, reported in the journalArchaeological and Anthropological Sciences, reinforce the idea that Neanderthals – who died out some 40,000 years ago –were capable of acts of artistic and symbolic creation, meaning modern humans were not the first to use art as a means of expression.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These are the basic elements characterising symbolism and, also prehistoric – non-figurative – art. Furthermore, this pebble could thus represent one of the oldest known abstractions of a human face in the prehistoric record.”Álvarez Alonso and his colleagues are looking forward to the debate that their discovery will reignite over whether modern humans were the first artists.“We’ve set out our interpretation in the article, but the debate goes on,” he said. “And anything to do with Neanderthals always prompts a massive debate. If we had a pebble with a red dot on it that was done 5,000 years ago by Homo sapiens, no one would hesitate to call it portable art. But associating Neanderthals with art generates a lot of debate. I think there’s sometimes an unintentional prejudice.”Still, said the archaeologist, he and the rest of the team believed the most logical explanation was that someone, a very long time ago, “saw something special in this pebble”, picked it up and set about imbuing it with meaning.“Why would a Neanderthal have seen it differently from the way we see it today?” he asked. “They were human, too. The thing here is that we’re dealing with an unparalleled object; there’s nothing similar. It’s not like art where, if you discover a cave painting, there are hundreds more you can use for context. But our assertion is that the Neanderthals had a similar capacity for symbolic thought to Homo sapiens – and we think this object reinforces that notion.”Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyNeanderthalsAnthropologySpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Von der Leyen initiated the call, the EU spokesperson said, adding “there was, it seems, a mutual intention to speak to each other”.The EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, is due to speak to the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, later on Monday. Thepair last spoke on Friday, after Trump’s latest tariff threat.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Monday he hoped Washington and Brussels could get to the lowest tariffs possible. “The discussions are advancing,” he told reporters during a trip to Vietnam.“There has been a good exchange between President Trump and President Von der Leyen and I hope we can continue on this road and return to the lowest possible tariffs that will allow for fruitful exchanges.”Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who is deemed to have one of the closest relationships with the White House among EU leaders, was reported by local media to be trying to organise a meeting between Trump and European leaders in early June.Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Harris, said there was “no time to waste” to find a deal that was good for the US and EU economies. “These contacts at the highest political level present the opportunity for negotiations to move forward. This is our priority. We want to see meaningful and substantive talks,” he said.Speaking on Monday, the commission confirmed thatthe EU’s “zero-for-zero” offerto eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods in transatlantic trade remained on the table. “We believe that is a very attractive starting point for a good negotiation that could lead to benefits on both sides of the Atlantic,” the trade spokesperson Olof Gill said.The commission declined to comment on the detailed talks between Trump and von der Leyen.The commission president hada brief exchange with Trumpat the pope’s funeral last month, her first since his return to the White House. Analysts have suggested the US president, who has repeatedly voiced hostility towards the EU and multilateral institutions, prefers to deal with national leaders.Trump initially announced a 20% levy on EU goods being sold into the US as part of his “liberation day” tariffs unveiled on 2 April, but a week later he reduced that to 10% to allow for time for talks. However on Friday, he claimed negotiations were “going nowhere”, upped the rate to 50% and brought the deadline forward to 1 June.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

US markets were closed for a public holiday on Monday, but futures rose on the U-turn news.The flip-flopping on border taxes has left many businesses unsure of what plans to make, with many withdrawing their financial forecasts in response.Trump’s 25% tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars remain in place. Šefčovič held a video conference on Monday with the chief executives of the carmakers Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, BMW and Stellantis to reassure them.The EU hassuspended its retaliatory tariffs on €21bn(£18bn) of US agricultural and industrial goods in Republican states, but they will kick in on 14 July without a deal. The European Commission is also consulting member states and European industry on a further round of retaliatory tariffs targeting €95bn (£80bn) of US goods, including bourbon, cars and industrial machinery.The commission has previously said it has not ruled out targeting US tech firms or banks, a potent but politically explosive target, as the US runs a €109bn (£91bn) trade surplus with the EU in service industries. Trump is more focused on the US trade deficit in goods, worth €198bn (£166bn) in 2024.Speaking before Trump’s latest round of on-off tariff threats, a senior EU diplomat said all options for retaliation were on the table, but stressed the wish for a settlement: “At the moment we still want to be de-escalatory and in a negotiating mood.”Explore more on these topicsTariffsEuropean UnionTrump tariffsDonald TrumpInternational tradeGlobal economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This allowed Manuel Weber, of Upemba national park’s department of research and biomonitoring, to snap a quick picture, thought to be the first photo taken of a living Upemba lechwe since it was identified as a subspecies in 2005.The last-ditch race to save the Orinoco crocodile – in picturesRead moreThe antelope stopped for “literally a few seconds”, Weber said.“The feeling was unbelievable, I barely slept the nights before we found it, very worried that we would not be able to do the survey, that we would not find any (in that case we would be responsible for the extinction of a species), and the need to get that photograph to generate the awareness needed to save them,” Weber said.Findingspublished in the African Journal of Ecologyprovide the first population update in more than 50 years.“This is a species on the very brink,” Weber, the lead author, added. “The fact that they’re still hanging on at all is extraordinary, but without urgent protection, they’ll vanish.”The Upemba lechwe is now considered one of the world’s rarest large mammals and is at imminent risk of extinction due to illegal poaching.The number one threat to its numbers is hunting, Weber said. “Up to 22,000 individuals were counted in the early 1970s, that was before the Upemba lechwe was described as a species. In the early 1990s, the meat of dozens was shipped every week to Bukama, the largest city in the area, along the Lualaba River.“I don’t see any problem with meat harvesting by the communities in the landscape, but this is only possible when we have viable populations.

Over the past six weeks, she and her seven teammates had reviewed more than 4,000 cases and made hundreds of calls to survivors. Now, even as the team drove home after their jobs were cut, their government phones kept ringing. “Survivors just kept calling us … And we weren’t able to help,” McGinley said.“I think of one survivor calling over and over, getting my voicemail, and thinking that Fema has abandoned them,” she added.View image in fullscreenWildfire victims seek disaster relief services at one of two Fema disaster recovery centers at the Pasadena city college community education center in California, on 14 January 2025.Photograph: Allen J Schaben/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesMore than 400 AmeriCorps staff and volunteers were deployed in the aftermath of the January megafires that destroyed thousands of homes and businesses and killed 30 people. Theyhelped26,000 households affected by the fires and packed 21,000 food boxes. But in April, the agency placed about 90% of its staff on immediate leave.The cuts were among the harshest doled out byDonald TrumpandElon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge). But AmeriCorps is just one of several agencies involved in the response to emergencies like the LA fires that has seen drastic reductions as Trump has sought to slash costs across the federal government andshiftdisaster preparedness on to state and local governments. Fema, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the army corps of engineers and the Small Business Administration (SBA) have all been affected as well.A flurry of lawsuits are challenging the Trump administration’s cuts to various federal departments, including two lawsuits led by thestate of CaliforniaandDemocracy Forwardover the gutting of AmeriCorps.But the cuts are already being acutely felt in LA’s burn zones. Disaster relief is composed of many different agencies at the local, state and federal levels, and the federal support is now being pulled out. “Jenga is one of the best ways to describe it,” said Kelly Daly, AmeriCorps employees union AFSCME Local 2027 president. “It’s going to come tumbling down.”The impact of AmeriCorps volunteersAnthony Garcia-Perez, 25, spent more than three months helping wildfire survivors, working six days a week and 10 hours a day. AmeriCorps made it possible for him to volunteer by covering his hotel and meals. He worked at a YMCA in Pasadena, handing out food and clothing donations to survivors, and at a disaster recovery center, assisting Fema workers and translating for wildfire survivors who only spoke Spanish.He recalls meeting a family of five who lost their home in the Eaton fire and became regulars at the YMCA. The mother, father and three young children were living in their car. The children had no toys. Garcia-Perez found dolls for the two girls, and a rattle toy for the family’s newborn son. “Seeing the smiles on the kids’ faces, getting something as simple as a doll, definitely made my day,” Garcia-Perez said. “The mom was overwhelmed. She started crying and thanking us for everything. We said we were more than happy to help. We’re here for them.”View image in fullscreenA view of burned houses and structures by the Pacific coastline of Malibu after massive wildfires occurred in January, in Los Angeles, California, on 20 March 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesGarcia-Perez heard on 28 April that the funding supporting him was cut. “We were told to go back to our hotels, pack and then be ready to go home the next day,” he said.Nearly a month after leavingLos Angeles, his mind still turns to the families he helped. “I wonder if they’re OK, I wonder if they’re getting the help they need.”Crucial Small Business Administration loansAfter the fires, the Small Business Administration contributed $2bn in disaster loans – thelargest sourceof federal disaster recovery for homeowners, renters, businesses and non-profits. In March, the Trump administration announced cuts to43%of the agency’s workforce.Judy Chu, the US congresswoman who represents wildfire survivors in Altadena, said she feared the federal cuts would make it harder for survivors to navigate recovery. “So many of them need help, especially the elderly and disabled,” she said. “I worry about them being able to make their way through the morass of bureaucracy.”Chu said she had already heard from Altadena residents who felt frustrated by the federal cuts.View image in fullscreenWildfire victims seek disaster relief services at one of two Fema disaster recovery centers at the Pasadena city college community education center in Pasadena on 14 January 2025.Photograph: Allen J Schaben/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesA woman who lost her home in the Eaton fire had told Chu she had secured a loan from the SBA, support she said was crucial because she was underinsured and couldn’t afford to rebuild without a loan. Since the Doge cuts, she said her caseworker was not responsive and she experienced long wait times to get questions answered.“Our community was devastated,” the woman wrote to Chu. “We want to rebuild and move forward, but how can we when the very support we rely on is being stripped away?”Canceling Fema’s disaster aidTo help the city recover, Fema approved more than $200m in relief funds for eligible wildfire survivors, and helped fund transitional hotels and shelters. The agency also deployed 70 staff to help survivors apply for aid. The White House said in a statement that Fema deployed hundreds of staff to Los Angeles and provided shelter for more than 2,800 households.The agency delivered crucial aid in LA, but now it is facing possible extinction. Trump hasthreatenedto get rid of Fema, and on 9 May, he fired its leader, Cameron Hamilton,one dayafter Hamilton publicly disagreed with dismantling the agency. The administration hasfiredhundreds of Fema employees and offered deferred resignations. Fema isendingdoor-to-door canvassing in disaster areas, andcancellingthe $750m set to be allocated this year through the building resilient infrastructure and communities grant program, which funds local projects to protect against disasters including wildfires.Brad Sherman, the US congressman who represents the fire-stricken neighborhood of the Palisades, said Trump had demoralized federal workers when the presidentsuggestedgetting rid of Fema while visiting Los Angeles in January. “I talked to Fema people, and they were, of course, upset. They’re professionals. They did their job. But it’s hard under those circumstances,” Sherman said.Sherman called it “absurd” that Trump wants to abolish Fema by pushing its responsibilities on to states. “The idea of shifting it to the states is absolutely crazy,” he said.Slashing army corps and EPA cleanup staffTwo federal agencies, the EPA and the army corps, are responsible for the majority of wildfire debris cleanup in Los Angeles. But both agencies are bleeding staff.“We’re relying on the army corps to do the debris removal, which is the single thing that has to happen before rebuilding can start,” Sherman said.As the climate crisis fuels more destructive wildfires, army corps workers are deploying to more burn zones. They had barely finished cleaning up after the fires in Lahaina, Hawaii, when they were deployed to Los Angeles, said Colin Smalley, president of IFPTE Local 777 representing army corps workers.The Doge deferred resignation program pushed a large number of army corps employees out the door, meaning there are fewer workers available to respond to wildfires, Smalley said. Supervisors can only approve staff to deploy to disaster missions to the extent that it doesn’t compromise the agency’s core functions, he explained. “It creates a concern about our ability to absorb these kinds of disasters. [Our disaster response] is jeopardized by these personnel actions thatElon Muskand Doge have forced upon us,” Smalley said.View image in fullscreenEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) contractors work to remove hazardous waste from a home destroyed in the Eaton fire on 12 February 2025 in Altadena, California.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesThe EPA, the agency responsible for the hazardous materials cleanup in Altadena and the Palisades, has faced brutal cuts, with Trump moving toreduce staff to 1980s levels.When Doge began slashing EPA staff in early March, it prompted an urgent letter from members of Congress, including Chu and Sherman, asking the agency to reconsider. “In the wake of the recentCalifornia wildfires, it is more critical than ever that EPA is fully staffed and supported to ensure EPA’s efforts to identify hazardous materials on properties impacted by the Eaton and Palisades fires is completed promptly,” they wrote.EPA staff completed the hazardous debris removal in Los Angelesin record time, but the cuts will harm future wildfire recovery, said Mark Sims, who recently retired from his role representing EPA workers at Engineers and Scientists of California Local 20, IFPTE. He explained that the EPA was suffering brain drain as both senior and new staff leave in droves. “Their responses will be a lot less robust, and take a lot longer to do,” he said.White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an email that “President Trump led a historic, record-breaking effort to clean up the damage from the LA wildfires, including turning on the water to prevent further tragedy,” referring to awidely debunkedclaim that Trump’s order for the Army Corps to release billions of gallons of irrigation water could have helped Los Angeles fight the fires. Fire hydrants ran dry in the Palisades due to aninfrastructure issue, not a water supply problem.Mass firings hamstring federal land agencies and wildfire responseRead moreShe argued LA’s mayor, Karen Bass, and California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, slowed down recovery efforts “by dragging their feet and bogging down the process with unnecessary bureaucracy and red tape” and the president had pushed them to speed up. “TheTrump administrationremains committed to empowering and working with state and local governments to invest in their own resilience before disaster strikes,” she wrote.A White House official said AmeriCorps had failedeightconsecutive audits and, in the fiscal year 2024, the agency had found and publicly reported $45m inimproper payments, which are outside the control of the agency and were made by grantee partners.Trump have argued his federal cuts are necessary to root out fraud and waste. But McGinley, the AmeriCorps team leader, said part of her team’s job was to review cases and ensure people were not receiving double benefits. “It made a difference that it helped people receive housing assistance, and it helped identify that waste in the government system, too,” she said.“My team worked really hard,” McGinley said. She recalled a woman who lost her home in the Eaton fire. She was blind, making it harder for her to upload the necessary documents to receive assistance. But McGinley’s team sent people to the woman’s hotel to help her upload the files to prove she was eligible. “She was able to stay in housing, which is huge after you’ve lost everything in your life,” McGinley said.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesWest CoastCaliforniaCalifornia wildfiresTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their bare appearance – stark even by UK standards – has been shaped by centuries of sheep grazing. Yet beneath the soil lie ancient tree roots: the silent traces of long-lost “ghost woodlands”.View image in fullscreenOver the past 12 years, 300,000 native trees have been planted by the projectNow, these woodlands are being encouraged to grow again. Over the past 12 years, 300,000 native trees have been planted across these hills in sheep-free enclosures. The results are beginning to be seen: birds and flowers are returning.Birdsong ripples through the valley as first light spills over a ridge line and on to 26 hectares (64 acres) of fenced-off land near Tebay village. Meadow pipits, reed buntings and stonechats are among the choristers. A flush of cotton grass bobs in the morning breeze and a stonechat fledgling clings to a spindly branch, shrieking for a parent.“We’ve been conditioned to see the uplands as barren for much of the year. It needn’t be that way,” says ecologist Mike Douglas from South Lakes Ecology, who is monitoring birds in the enclosures. “We are 10 years into what was ecologically very damaged land,” says Douglas, who is conducting his first of four surveys for the 2025 season.View image in fullscreenAs the trees grow within the enclosures, birds and flowers are returning to the landscapeBig rewilding projects often happen on private land with limited public access. These enclosures are a result of agreements reached between dozens of farmers on common land with public access. “Doing so much tree-planting on a common was groundbreaking,” says Peter Leeson from the Woodland Trust. “People hadn’t been doing this in the uplands before at this scale.”Farmer and conservation collaboration is the real joy. We want the same thingsPeter LeesonBluebells are popping up and there are patches of bracken, which suggest the soils and seed banks retain the memory of being a woodland despite hundreds of years of sheep grazing. “We call these memories ‘ghost woodlands’,” says Leeson. These ancient woodland indicators could offer a blueprint of where trees should return.View image in fullscreenEcologist Mike Douglas records birdsong on his phoneEach year, Douglas is finding more breeding birds moving in. Last year, there were 14 breeding species here. Before the enclosure was created, he says, just four would have been found: meadow pipit, skylarks, wren and grey wagtails. Eleven new breeding bird species have been recorded since the original 2016 survey, with numbers increasing year-on-year. “I’m surprised by how quickly birds have colonised, and the diversity of species,” says Douglas.Tree planting covers 12% of the entire 128-hectare (316-acre) fell. The enclosures were possible thanks to a 10-year government agri-environment scheme, signed by farmers with grazing rights to the fell as part of the Tebay Common Grazing Association, and the owner of the fell, Lonsdale Estates, supported and monitored by the Woodland Trust.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenClockwise from main image: A female stonechat calls from a bilberry bush; a meadow pipit nest with three eggs hidden in deep grass; a green veined white butterfly on a cuckoo flower; a stonechat flicking it wings while making a call similar to two stones being struck together; a green hairstreak butterflyLeeson says schemes like this could be echoed in other upland areas, which covermore than a thirdof the UK and aregenerally grazedor managed so woodlands are suppressed. “This is a wonderful exemplar of what could happen – if we choose to,” he says.‘Un-managing the land’: sheep make way for trees in Cumbria's uplandsRead moreAcross Europe, conflicts between farmers and conservationistsare increasingdue to the need for maintaining food production while creating space for nature. This conflict tends to be especially pronounced in the uplands because the land is relatively unproductive for farming. “Farmer and conservation collaboration is the real joy,” Leeson says. “We want the same things. We want to be listened to, and heard and involved. I’d say we’re friends now.”John Capstick, chair of the Ravenstonedale Common Graziers Association, which hosts 187 hectares (462 acres) of fenced off land, says at first some farmers “were dead against it being fenced off. They were frightened it was an ulterior motive to get sheep off the fell.” Now, “there is the odd one who still whines,” but most are happy, he says.In fact, the trees are not proving a threat to hill farming. The money is a lifeline for farmers, whoearn as little as £7,500a year from selling sheep and have been reliant ondisappearing government subsidies. The Tebay scheme provides payments of £25,600 a year for maintaining the trees and fences and for loss of grazing rights, which are shared equally between the landowner and the farmers.View image in fullscreenFor now, semi-feral fell ponies are kept out of the new woodland with fencingTwenty-five years ago, there were 25 farmers on Tebay common. Now there are 10. For those who still graze on the common, the payments are “keeping them going”, says Tim Winder, chair of the Tebay Common Grazing Association, whose father’s family have been farming for as long as they can remember.Now, Winder is working with researchers on using the fells for peatland restoration andnatural flood management. “We have to look at different ways of farming,” he says. “We’ll invite anyone to work with us.”View image in fullscreenMeadow pipits in one of the young trees. In time, more common birds such as tits, dunnocks and blackbirds will nest hereIn the years to come, patches of mature woodland and scrubland will develop here, and common birds such as great tits, blue tits, dunnocks and blackbirds, will move in, says Douglas. It is a mystery what these hills may have looked like hundreds of years ago – no detailed historical records exist. Ghost woodlands speak of not only what has been lost, but what could one day return. “This was a leap in the dark for the farmers, as much as anyone else,” says Leeson. “Hats off to them.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsThe age of extinctionBirdsNational parksAnimalsWildlifeConservationRewildingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even with roles, it’s no longer heads of DEI, it’s heads of culture, heads of people, heads of wellbeing.“They’re basically embedding diversity and getting rid of the word – I don’t necessarily see it as a bad thing. When I first started, back in 2003, it was about diversity – and that was the main word – but then, as it progressed, it was inclusion. It’s advancing now to culture, transformation, that kind of thing, as culture affects the whole organisation.”In the UK, the Reform party has vowed to scrap DEI initiatives from councils it controls, months after the Trump administration begansacking black public servantsandripping up fairness policies.Experts believe a full-scale rollback is unlikely in the UK, where the Equalities Act and the legal risk of discrimination cases present barriers to turning back the clock.View image in fullscreenPaul Sesay says DEI initiatives are being rebranded as ‘wellbeing’, ‘belonging’ and ‘culture’.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBut some companies, particularly US-headquartered firms, havealready scaled back some commitments,and are less keen to celebrate inclusion work publicly.Sesay said US businesses were finding ways to disguise DEI work so they could still promote the best talent and address inequalities. “American companies have had to change, simply to survive in America. They have to take the word diversity out of absolutely everything. I’ve heard a few firms that say inclusion is allowed within their policies, but the word diversity isn’t.”Noreen Biddle Shah, who founded Reboot, a campaigning group of senior financial service professionals, to tackle racial inequality in the industry in 2019, said the “landscape feels very different” now.“DEI has become a politically charged term, and many firms are either stepping back from the work – a trend we saw coming from the US, but it is impacting UK financial services too,” said Shah.“Not only do fewer organisations want to partner with us, but they’re also discouraging their own employees from speaking out. In our latest annual Race to Equality: Financial Services report, we found that in light of the DEI backlash, ethnic minority professionals in the sector feel muzzled for speaking out – many expressed fear of losing their jobs if they raised race-related concerns. And sadly, 70% said there has been little progress since theBlack Lives Matter movement.”Even before theretrenchment driven by Trump’s return, there was concern companies weredrawing back from promisesmade in 2020, when the Black Lives Matter movement sparked a conversation across the west about societal fairness.View image in fullscreenNina Mohanty (in red dress) at Veuve Clicquot’s Bold Future awards.Photograph: Dave Benett/Max Cisotti/Sam Simpson/GettyNina Mohanty, a finalist in Veuve Clicquot’s Bold Future awards 2025, which celebrates rising female entrepreneurs, and who is the founder of a tech startup, Bloom Money, said: “In the world of startups and tech companies, you had a lot of VCs [venture capitalists] that were saying, ‘we’re gonna do special programmes for black entrepreneurs, we’re gonna back more women and women of colour’. And there are a lot of initiatives and there’s a lot of talk. Five years on, where are those things? The budgets are gone.”James Hockin, an employment law expert and partner at global law firm Withers who advises senior executives in New York and London, said Trump’s unpopularity among some people also meant employees were exerting pressure on British employers to keep policies in place.“We’ve got more people in the UK now saying, ‘well, what are we saying on this? I don’t like what Trump is doing on DEI’,” he said.“There has been for a little while, a bit of a temptation just to keep quiet and let it happen and just go, ‘OK, let’s just wait and see’. But I think increasingly, with pressure from employees, there is a desire for employers to be seen to be taking a stance.”Agreeing that DEI would survive but in a “rebranded” form, Hockin said: “DEI, for employers at least, started from a place of sorting out the culture in an organisation so that you weren’t leaving yourself vulnerable to a [legal] claim against your organisation –employers were keen to mitigate their risk.“Where employers are getting on side with the Trump agenda, inadvertently, what they’re doing, is potentially opening themselves up to that risk.”View image in fullscreenNoreen Biddle Shah: ‘DEI has become a politically charged term.’Photograph: RebootEarlier this year, Shirine Khoury-Haq, the CEO of Co-op group,warned that a DEI rollback risked undoing decades of progress.Zahoor Ahmad, Co-op’s head of social mobility, said: “The key assumption is that if you didn’t have [DEI], everything will be a level playing field. All of human history tells us that is not true. It’s very hard to have a true meritocracy, when we are not born equal. What we are trying to do is eliminate inequalities.”A number of trade bodies have also doubled down on their commitment to inclusion in the face of the backlash.The Law Society’s president, Richard Atkinson, said that while “the current climate in the United States has made diversity and inclusion work increasingly difficult”, the organisation would never waver from its “wholehearted” commitment to a more diverse and inclusive legal profession.UK Finance, which represents the banking and financial service sector, said greater diversity was “a driver for economic success”, while the Local Government Association said the case for DEI remained “compelling”.Dawar Hashmi, a director at Penna, a leading recruiter for senior local government executives, said: “There has been a noticeable pullback in the UK within some sectors – when the US sneezes, the UK catches a cold. This trend concerns me. But the public sector, our primary client base, continues to champion these values. Embracing DEI isn’t just morally right, its actually a strategic advantage.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessThe race reportRaceBlack Lives Matter movementInequalitynewsShareReuse this content"

It would establish the rules around compensation eligibility and help administer payments.Sources said the plan was at an early stage but was being “actively worked on” and that ministers were pushing to find the right model.There has been widespread criticism of the role government has taken in the running of redress schemes in the past.The compensation scheme for victims of theWindrush scandal, in which a generation of people who made their lives in the UK after coming from the Caribbean were mistreated by the Home Office, was said to have “become a source of further trauma rather than redress”, according to the Commons home affairs select committee.The complexity of the scheme to compensate victims of the infected blood scandal, in which more than 30,000 people contracted HIV and hepatitis C due to NHS failings, was said to have led to a situation in which people died before they were able to secure redress.This week, Bates, who was the lead campaigner for post office operators persecuted and even prosecuted due to the accounting failures of the Horizon IT system, described the compensation scheme in that scandal as being a “quasi kangaroo court”.In each case, the involvement of government was said to have undermined confidence of victims that they were being treated fairly and led to rules that were overly “legalistic”, it is claimed.Bates, who revealed this weekend that he had beengiven a final “take it or leave it” offerthat amounted to 49.2% of his original claim for redress, has said he believes that it is crucial to take future schemes out of government hands.Last year, a National Audit Office report, titled Lessons learned: government compensation schemes, found recurring problems, but Bates said it had not addressed the problematic role of the state itself.He argued that the independent arbiters in current schemes, including for the victims of Horizon, were being constrained by rules written by government officials.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a Saturday night, so there’s nothing I could do. Spent the whole night up crying. I was at the police station at first light … They were just really dismissive, and it just that’s when everything changed. I became the enemy of them. Well, you know, that’s my perception of it.“I spent three and a half years going through the complaint system, being told at every step of the way, this is not a breach, this is not a breach, this is not a breach.”Clutterbuck got legal representation in 2018 and her claim was made in 2021 but the formal admission of liability by West Mercia police was only recently made in an amended defence filed at court. She said her decision to speak about her abuse after the officer had revealed her identity was made in an attempt to get control of her situation.She said: “To my mind, the only solution to that type of thing happening is to actually take control and say, I give up anonymity, and I am going to speak on this topic, and I am going to not have the shame that you give me. Still in the papers that have gone to the high court, they criticise me and use it as a way of downgrading their damage.“This is why victims don’t challenge the police, because they have the public purse. It is appalling that they’re using public money to fight these cases where actually: you’ve admitted liability.”Chair of child sexual abuse inquiry calls Tory response ‘awful, inconsequential’Read moreClutterbuck added: “Nobody else really has the right to know I’m a victim of sexual abuse unless I choose to tell them. And the very notion that the people that you trust and that actually are protecting you are the ones that breach that trust and place you in that position is appalling.”Maria Mulla, a barrister who is working withvictims of the late owner of Harrods Mohamed Al Fayed, is representing Clutterbuck. She said: “The decision to disclose or not is a colossal one for survivors of sexual abuse and in particular child sexual abuse.“West Mercia police stole Heidi’s lifetime right to absolute anonymity, a right that is enshrined in legislation. Once this had been stolen from her Heidi had no choice but to be brave and take back control by advocating for others.”West Mercia police declined a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsPoliceChild protectionChildrenGloucestershirenewsShareReuse this content"

Lobbying has reached the Trump administration, where the US state department says it is monitoring the case, referring to its concern about “infringements on freedom of expression”.Funds raised for Connolly in Britain include £40,000 raised by Reclaim the Media – a company set up by the far-right agitator and former actor Laurence Fox.Patriotic Alternative, one of Britain’s most active far-right groups, told supporters it gave her family £1,000 from a fund established for what it described as “political prisoners”.At the same time, the judge who sentenced Connolly has become a target of abuse. Social media posts included one by a far-right influencer who mocked up a photograph of the judge under the heading: The Banality of Evil: Who is Lucy Connolly’s Anti-British, Woke Judge?’“Death Penalty” replied an X user with a blue tick.Concerns have been expressed by the Law Society, which told the Guardian: “Attacks on the legal profession undermine the rule of law and can have real-life consequences.”“In recent years, negative language used by politicians and the media about legal professionals has seen waves of online hate and death threats causing many lawyers to seek police protection,” said Richard Atkinson, the president of the Law Society of England and Wales.“During the riots last summer, 39 law firms and advice centres were targeted. Nobody should be put at risk for doing their job, least of all when that job is to uphold the law.”There is also unease at the tone and language used by more high-profile figures on the right, including Boris Johnson, who claimed Connolly’s case showed Britain was becoming a “police state”.Charlie Falconer, a Labour peer and former justice secretary, condemned the remarks, adding: “Attacking the law and the judges who give effect to it is a cowardly and deceptive way of trying to justify despicable criminal conduct.”There is now also concern within Labour about the potential of the case to gain traction among the general public. Mary Glindon, a Labour MP, broke ranks on Thursday to join Conservative MPs in signing a motion of support for Connolly from Rupert Lowe, the former Reform UK MP who used prime minister’s questions to raise the case.Glindon said she had signed the motion because she was upset Connolly had lost her appeal, adding that her young daughter would continue to be without her mother. While backing the judge, other Labour MPs have privately expressed concern about how the case could be exploited.For now, the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, has resisted the urge to echo the exact “two-tier” language of Reform and others, saying instead that Connolly had been treated unfairly and there was a perception of bias that was “fuelling radicalisation”.But a Conservative strategist likened the case to the controversy surrounding the new guidance around sentencing of offenders from ethnic minorities. They also noted: “Unusually, this is a case in which the alt-media has had real cut-through on it.”Connolly, meanwhile, is expected to remain in prison until August, although the campaign in support of her continues. Her most high-profile backer has been the Free Speech Union, the libertarian organisation founded by the Tory peer Toby Young, which has funded her legal team. It says the public reaction to the campaign has been “off the charts”.At the heart of the case is an X post in July last year that changed Connolly’s life forever. “Mass deportation now, set fire to all the fucking hotels full of the bastards for all I care … if that makes me racist so be it,” she tweeted to 9,000 followers, after three girls were killed in a knife attack at a holiday club in Southport.In a written judgment published last Tuesday, an appeal court judge said: “There is no arguable basis on which it could be said that the sentence imposed by the judge was manifestly excessive.”Responding to Lowe on Wednesday, Starmer backed the courts, stating he is “against incitement of violence to other people” and stressing that sentencing was a “matter for our courts”.Connolly’s husband, Raymond Connolly, used an interview on GB News on Friday to accuse the prime minister of having “picked” his wife as “the poster girl of the far right”.“We’ve got a government who are just doing what they want to do,” he said, denying she was far right and accusing Starmer of “total intimidation”.In strictly legal terms,experts point outthat Connolly’s sentence was severe because inciting racial hatred is one of the most serious offences under hate crime legislation. Connolly had also pleaded guilty.Sunjay Versani, the director of crime and prison law at Duncan Lewis Solicitors, said the court considered the likely impact of the message and whether it was capable of encouraging others to hate. Factors included the public nature vulnerability of the target and absence of credible mitigation, despite her expression of regret.“There has been plenty said about the sentence being too severe. However, the reality is the term is properly in line with sentencing guidelines,” he added.“One of the reasons they exist is to ensure uniformity … so the same sentence for the same criminal conduct is handed down, regardless of whether you’re in London, Leicester or Leeds.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeThe far rightSouthport attacknewsShareReuse this content"

The 18 people injured were later reported toall be in stable condition,while the womanwas placed in psychiatric care.As the city reeled from the incident, the spotlight landed on Muhammad Al Muhammad, who had been heading to his home in Buchholz, 25km from Hamburg, after visiting a friend in the city. He was waiting on the platform for his train when he spotted a woman wielding a knife.Woman arrested after 17 people injured in knife attack at Hamburg train stationRead moreHe watched as people began running away from the woman. “I decided to run in the other direction and stop the woman,” he told theGerman news magazine Der Spiegel.As he made his way, he saw another man, whom he described as Chechen, kick the woman in the knee, causing her to fall to the ground. “I held her [down] and pressed her hands against her rucksack so she couldn’t get up,” he said. “The woman didn’t scream, she didn’t resist.”Police arrived a few moments later. As they pointed their weapons towards them, Muhammad moved away from the woman slowly, his hands raised in the air.Der Spiegel, which said it had verified Muhammad’s identity, noted that the actions of the two men had probably prevented more people from being injured.News of their interventions soon began to make waves across Germany, with some contrasting it to the sustained efforts by the far-right, anti-immigrant party Alternative für Deutschland, to link migration to crime, even as a recent study by the Munich-based Ifo Institutefound therewas “no correlation” between migration and higher crime rates.Many in German media have seemingly also echoed this association; a2023 analysisfound that both print and television media reported five times more on violent crimes when the suspect was a foreigner in Germany, the broadcaster Deutsche Wellenoted recently.Against this backdrop, it was crucial to share the story of Muhammad, who is originally from near Aleppo and arrived in Germany as a refugee in 2022, the journalist and political commentatorGilda Sahebi wrotein Germany’sDie Tageszeitung newspaper.“One is tempted to say: ‘See? An Arab – his name is Muhammad, no less – is a hero!’” Sahebi wrote. “The political and public debate is now so dripping with racist toxicity, spread by a far-right party and its influencers in media and social media, but also by democratic political and media actors, that it is necessary to tell the story of Muhammad Al Muhammad.”Muhammad said that, following the attack, he had been questioned by police before eventually making his way home. “The police thanked me and bought me a cappuccino,” he said. “That made me very happy.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeRefugeesSyrianewsShareReuse this content"

However, if a gate check reveals it is oversized the fee is £60. A larger cabin bag can be added to a flight booking for £6 to £36 depending on the route but, again, if it is deemed too large it costs £75 to stow.Spain has become a battleground for the issue. Last year, its Consumer Rights Ministryfined five budget airlines, including Ryanair, a total of €179m(£150m) for charging passengers for hand luggage and seat reservations. This month, a Spanish judgeordered Ryanairto refund a passenger €147 in hand luggage charges racked up across five flights, including a return trip from Spain to the UK.In the ruling, Judge Raquel Martínez Marco said “carry-on luggage is an essential element of passenger transportation” and therefore “cannot be subject to a price supplement”. The case was backed by Spanish consumer rights organisation Facua, which has beendecrying the “illegal surcharge”since 2018.Kenton Jarvis, easyJet’s chief executive, suggested passengers were happy to pay for the service they wanted. He said a third of its customers “take no ancillaries, and therefore are happy taking the free [smaller] cabin bag”.Expecting them to pay for people who want to bring a larger cabin bag “doesn’t feel very consumer friendly”, he said.Jarvis added that free cabin bags were previously a “big logistical headache” for easyJet because they could not all fit in the overhead lockers. This led to delays and passengers being inconvenienced by having their bag put in the hold. “That’s why it is good to just ask the traveller to pay for what they want,” he said.Ryanair’s chief executive,Michael O’Leary,said it would not be changing its policies: “The Spanish have a mad minister who’s decided that as General Franco passed some law 30 years before Spain joined the European Union, passengers are free to bring as much baggage as they want,” he said.“It’s a clear breach of European regulations,” he said. “The European Commission have already told Spain it’s illegal.”Any attempt to intervene would be in breach of the regulation that guarantees airlines the freedom to set prices and policies free from political interference, O’Leary added.“In the short term, you have a couple of the consumer agencies inSpaintaking decisions at local court level and trumpeting these,” he said. “It’s not going to change. We’re not changing our policy. It will get referred to the European courts; we’ll be appealing those rulings. In reality, there isn’t that demand from passengers.”Reyna said that given the current review into EU legislation governing air passenger rights there was an opportunity to clarify what services should be included in a basic ticket price.“Our data shows that consumers expect to see a small item and a piece of hand luggage when buying basic tickets,” he said.“Policymakers should also define hand luggage’s ‘reasonable size and weight’ to avoid surprises at the airport and ultimately reduce the number of disputes costing consumers and airlines time and money.”Kevin Bodley, a consultant at law firm Steele Raymond, who specialises in aviation law, said the Spanish ruling “had delivered a clear message against hidden airline fees”. While neither the Spanish judgment nor future EU laws are binding in the UK they could still “influence legal reasoning and consumer rights discussions in the UK”, he said.“The end result suggests the emergence of an increasing level of protection to passengers at the expense of the airlines,” Bodley said. “However, this may well be cancelled out by the need for airlines to increase overall fare levels to cover this at the ultimate expense of travellers.”Explore more on these topicsAirline industryRyanaireasyJetSpainEuropeConsumer affairsConsumer rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

The EU staff group welcomed this move, but said it was “devastatingly late for thousands killed in Gaza”.The commission has yet to reveal the timetable for reviewing the trade accord, which was signed in 2000. While the EU-Israel agreement can only be suspended by unanimous agreement among the 27 member states, key provisions, including on trade and Israel’s participation in Europe’s Horizon research funding programme, can be frozen on the basis of a weighted-majority vote.“The recent announcement of a review of the EU-Israel association agreement – 20 months into the conflict, and as thousands of children face starvation due to the renewed blockade on humanitarian aid – raises serious concerns about the adequacy and timing of the EU’s response,” Zeno Benetti, one of the co-authors of the letter, said.EU Staff for Peace last year called for a suspension of the EU-Israel agreement, an end to member states’ arms exports to Israel and “concrete efforts” to support the work of the international criminal court and international court of justice. The group has now accused the institutions they work for of an “apparent double standard” by failing to condemn European leaders who discussed hosting Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime ministerwanted for alleged war crimes by the ICC.Hungaryhosted Netanyahu for a four-day state visit in April. Poland considered the possibility of him attending the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and Germany’s then chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, promised to find a way for Netanyahu to visit Germany without being arrested.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re talking about maximum temperatures that are between five and 10 degrees above normal for this time of year. In some areas, the temperatures will be more than 10 degrees above normal on Thursday.”Del Campo said the high temperatures were down to the presence of high-pressure areas over the peninsula – “which guarantee stable weather with few clouds and a lot of sun” – and the arrival of a mass of dry, warm air over the peninsula from North Africa.He added that the most affected areas would be south-east Spain, its central region, and the Ebro Valley in the north-east of the country. Temperatures on the two hottest days this week – probably Thursday and Friday – are forecast to reach 35C in central and northern areas and 40C along the Guadalquivir River in Andalucía.The hot spell is forecast to last until at least Saturday, when atmospheric instability could bring clouds, dust clouds, and a lowering of temperatures.Spain recorded its highest ever temperature in August 2021, when the mercury in the Andalucían town of Montoro, near Córdoba,reached 47.4C.A2022 Aemet studyfound that the arrival of 30C temperatures across Spain and the Balearic islands had come an average of 20 to 40 days earlier over the past 71 years. “The summer is eating up the spring,” Del Campotold El Paísat the time.“What’s happening fits perfectly with a situation where you have a warmer planet,” he said, adding that the rise in temperatures was a “direct and palpable [consequence] of climate change … The climate in Spain isn’t the one we used to know. It’s got more extreme.”Explore more on these topicsSpainEurope weatherEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He talks about his Parkinson’s disease, Woody Allen – and what he really thinks of Donald TrumpMon 26 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 12.18 EDTShareAlan Alda never expected this. The 89-year-old is back topping the charts with an update of his film The Four Seasons. In 1981, Alda wrote, directed and starred in the movie about three inseparable couples who holiday together every quarter until divorce, envy and angst intervene.Now the film has been turned into a TV series byTina Fey, with Alda as a producerand, at the time of writing, it is the fourth most watched show on Netflix. “It’s really interesting to have my work appeal to a new generation of very smart writers,” he tells me on a video call from New York. What gave him even more pleasure was watching a screening of the original movie a couple of weeks ago. “The people were laughing at the same things they were 44 years ago. And just as heartily. It was so good to see that the point of view wasn’t outdated.”Alda makes a cameo appearance at the start of the TV series as Don, an elderly man with Parkinson’s disease. “At the moment, I can play anyone with Parkinson’s,” he says. He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2015 and went public about it in 2018. His shakes are now pronounced, the gorgeous jet-black hair is long gone, and he looks his age. But as soon as his face breaks out into that familiar cheek-to-cheek grin, he becomes boyish again. Not quite the Hawkeye of yesteryear, but a venerable facsimile.View image in fullscreenAlan Alda as Hawkeye in M*A*S*H.Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/ShutterstockCaptain Benjamin “Hawkeye” Pierce of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital unit is the character that made Alda’s name, inM*A*S*H, the TV war comedy-dramaset in 1950s South Korea. Hawkeye is a hard-drinking, skirt-chasing, war-hating, wisecracking surgeon, brimming with principle and soul. As for Alda himself, he has the principle and soul, but less of the boozy priapism. In fact, he is better known as an early champion of equal rights for women, and a poster boy for marriage, celebrating 68 years and counting with his wife, Arlene. In a poll of American women in the early 1990s, participants were asked to nominate their ideal man. Jesus was first with 14%, Mahatma Gandhi second with 8% and Alda third with 7%.At an age when many of us would barely remember retiring, Alda is phenomenally busy. As well as the acting and producing, there are theAlan Alda Center for Communicating Scienceand a podcast series, Clear + Vivid, which he has presented since 2018. Alda is a warm and generous presenter, and in more than 350 episodes he has interviewed a fascinating range of people, including AI guru Jaron Lanier, Paul McCartney, members of the M*A*S*H cast, astrophysicist Mario Livio, and Michael J Fox about how he has coped with his Parkinson’s.At the end of each episode of Clear + Vivid, he asks his guests seven questions, including, is there anybody they can’t empathise with? Communication and striving for empathy have always been at the heart of his work. Whether as a director, actor or writer he has always opted for dramas about relationships where people talk their way to a resolution or otherwise.Alda was born Alphonso Joseph D’Abruzzo, in New York. His father, an actor and singer of Italian heritage who appeared in burlesque and then became a film star, adopted the name Robert Alda. His mother, Joan, a beauty pageant winner later diagnosed with schizophrenia, was of Irish descent. Through his childhood the family travelled around the US, following his father where the work took him. “He was very famous but he hardly made much money because that was at a time when Warner had those seven-year contracts.”View image in fullscreenAlda with Tina Fey at a special screening of The Four Seasons 1981 film in New York.Photograph: Jason Mendez/Getty Images for NetflixIn the opening sentence to his fine memoir Never Have Your Dog Stuffed, he writes: “My mother didn’t try to stab my father until I was six, but she must have shown signs of oddness before that.” Does he think his mother’s condition made him more empathetic? “I’ve thought about it a lot, but I haven’t traced an interest in empathy to that.” A typical Alda response. He is not one for easy answers. “It may be true. What I was aware of was that I had to constantly observe her. When she told me something, I had to figure out whether this was reality or just her reality. She would point to cracks in the wall and say there were cameras in there taking our picture.”His mother taught him how to improvise – something that has remained important to him in work and life. He had to know how to react to whatever reality she was in for his own safety. She was eventually diagnosed and hospitalised when he was a student. “I was in college in Paris, Dad was making a TV series in Amsterdam and Mom was running down the hotel corridor one night naked banging on doors.”At the age of seven, Alda was diagnosed with polio. He was put on a strict swimming regime. “As part of the therapy, I swam seven hours a day. I fully recovered.” Did he end up a strong swimmer? He smiles. “No, but it gave me a lot of stamina.”As a young boy, Alda performed with his father in the less risque burlesque sketches. Did he always want to be an actor? He shakes his head. “I wanted to be a writer when I was eight, and it was only later in life, when I was nine, that I wanted to be an actor.” His quips are so dry they’re easy to miss.He starts coughing, and drinks from a glass of water that he holds with quivering hands. “The problem is the pollen count is very high here. I’m very allergic to pollen.”View image in fullscreenA poster boy for marriage … Alda in 2015 with his wife of 68 years, Arlene.Photograph: Tim Boxer/Getty ImagesHow is his Parkinson’s? “A little shaky!” He smiles. How does it affect him? “Not much. I just have to plan for the fact that everything takes three times longer to do or more. Getting your clothes on, taking your pills. I have to type every email three times before I stop saying rude things. I write emails to women I don’t know and unless I check, before my signature there are six Xs.” Would he normally send kisses? “Not to somebody I don’t know!” he says, appalled. “Dr Parkinson has fun with the keyboard.”Does it annoy him? “I rarely get upset at it because I know it’s reality. It’s much easier to take reality than wish for something you haven’t got. I fell into this way of thinking that if a button takes too long to button, I have to find other ways to do it. And eventually if I land on a way that makes the button go through the buttonhole it’s a little victory for me, and I feel like a million bucks.” He pauses. “It sounds like something I read in a self-help book, but it isn’t. It’s just the way I found myself reacting, and I’m very glad that I did.”At 21, Alda married Arlene, a professional clarinettist. When M*A*S*H started in 1972, he was already in his mid-30s, the father of three daughters, and a respected theatre actor. Initially, he didn’t want to accept the role because it would take him away from the family for too long. In the end, he starred in every episode over 11 seasons and 11 years, directing 32 episodes (more than anybody else) and writing 19.He learned so much from the show, not least how best to work with people. In between shoots, rather than disappearing to dressing rooms, they sat in a circle, laughing, chatting, making fun of each other. “When they called us to the set, we still had that connection, and it came out in between the lines we were saying to each other, so there were peoplereallytalking to each other.” Not only was M*A*S*H a huge success, it made him extremely wealthy. At the start, he earned good money – $10,000 an episode. By the end, he was on $250,000 a show. The final episode was watched by 106 million people in the US, still a record for a scripted TV series.View image in fullscreenAlda directing The Four Seasons in 1981.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyThe money gave him the freedom to do what he wanted with his life, not least develop his own projects. While still working on M*A*S*H, he made The Four Seasons, which is the film that means most to him because it’s so personal. “Much of my family was engaged in it. Arlene wrote a book about the making of it, she did the photographs for one of the characters, two of our daughters acted in it. It was about incidents that had occurred among my close circle of friends.”I ask if there’s a secret to a long, happy marriage. No, he says. “I don’t think it can be put into a nugget. It involves being aware of how much you love the person not only in tender moments but also when you’re screaming at each other. Arlene has a simpler explanation.” What’s that? “When people ask her what’s the secret of a long marriage she says a short memory.”View image in fullscreenCarol Burnett as Kate Burroughs and Alda as her husband Jack in The Four Seasons.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyHow is she? A huge sunny smile envelops his face, and his eyes narrow to a joyous squint. “She’sgreat. I had to stop her from playing the piano so we could talk. She practises at least two hours every day. She doesn’t have the breath now for the clarinet so she’s gone back to the piano for the first time in decades.”The pollen has got to him, and I’m worried about his coughing. He seems tired and we have already been talking for well over an hour. So we say our goodbyes. He tells me how good it has been to chat. And it has, but about five minutes later I realise there is so much more to talk about. I email his publicist, and ask if there is any chance of a catch-up.View image in fullscreen‘He’s a very nice guy!’ … Alda in Scorsese’s The Aviator in 2004.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyTwo days later, we are back on Zoom, and he is talking about the great directors he has worked with. Alda got his only Oscar nomination playing a sleazy senator in Martin Scorsese’s 2004 film The Aviator. What did he learn from Scorsese? Positivity, he says. “Everything he had to say was filled with praise. ‘That was great what you got! Maybe next time try a bit more of this, but justgreat!’Later in the day you find out he didn’t like what you did at all!” He laughs. “He’s a very nice guy.”Alda made three films with Woody Allen – Everyone Says I Love You, Crimes and Misdemeanors andManhattan Murder Mystery. Which is his favourite? “Crimes and Misdemeanors,” he says instantly. Alda is memorable as the pompous documentary-maker with a fine line in cant. What did Allen teach him? “I don’t know what I learned from him because he didn’t talk much. You and I have spoken more than he spoke making three movies!”View image in fullscreenAlda and Arlene in New York in 1990.Photograph: Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection/Getty ImagesA number of actors have said they won’t work with Allen again after his adoptive daughter accused him of sexual abuse. Would Alda? “Yes I would. If a court has made a decision, I’m willing to go along with that. But I’m not the court. I’m glad Harvey Weinstein went to jail. He was tried and convicted. But I’m not going to punish somebody who hasn’t gone through that process. People have to make up their own mind about what’s reasonable and follow their feelings.”In 2006, Alda won an Emmy for playing Arnold Vinick inThe West Wing, a moderate Republican presidential candidate who ends up as secretary of state in a Democratic government. Could he see something like that happening in real life? “No. No. Even at that time he was a fantasy.”How does he feel about the US now? “We’re in a time of crisis and I hope we can work our way out. I hope there are enough people of good will and conscience and courage to take us out of it. People on all sides. These are the times that try men’s souls.” Has he ever known a time like this in his life? “No! Never.Never. No. I don’t think anybody in our country has.”View image in fullscreen‘Yes, I would work with him again’ … with Woody Allen in Crimes and Misdemeanors in 1989.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyCan he empathise with Donald Trump in any way? “Every once in a while I wonder if the desire to tear down everything that some of us over here have actually does come from a grievance that ought to be addressed. If there’s anything that has been overlooked or underserved among the population that wants to tear everything down, then they ought to be served properly. If on the other hand it’s just racism, misogyny and anti-science, then we need to reach out to one another for some education.”He catches his tone, and says he doesn’t like it. “To say I’m going to educate you is a little top heavy,” he says apologetically. “Exploring the data and trying to understand what’s reality and what isn’t would be helpful for everybody.” Is Trump a racist? “Well, he certainly does racist things and says racist things.” A misogynist? “By his own mouth he is.” Anti-science? “I think a person who suggests that taking horse pills or swallowing bleach will help Covid is anti-science. Science has been defunded now a lot in the US, and that’s going to have serious consequences for people’s health and for the security of the country.”Does he worry the US is moving towards fascism? Silence. He eventually answers. “Authoritarianism, clearly,” he says.View image in fullscreenIn The West Wing.Yet, despite everything, he feels optimistic about the future. “I’ve got a tremendous amount of confidence that the world is going to work out for us humans.” After all, he points out, species tend to last around 2m years, and we’re only 300,000 years old. “It would be great if we could exist 2m years.”I can hear a piano in the background. Is that Arlene? “Yes, she’s so absorbed in her music. She’s playing Beethoven.” I tell him I’ve been thinking about something he said the other day – that he and Arlene remember how much they love each other when they’re having a screaming match. Do they scream at each other often? “No, we make each other laugh. But you can’t have a marriage that goes on for a long time without strong disagreements.”Is it unusual for a couple in his business to have stayed together so long? Not really, he says. “You know, we’ve been good friends for decades with Mel Brooks and we were with Carl Reiner [who died in 2020], and both had very long marriages. And there are plenty of friends who have been married for 50 or 60 years.” He pauses, and I can see his mouth creasing into that sunny smile. “To multiple people, but at least they were only married to one at a time.” I burst out laughing. Have you ever said that before? “No, I don’t think I have!” And he sounds so happy.This article was amended on 26 May 2025 because an earlier version referred to Rob Reiner when his father, the late Carl Reiner was meant.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe G2 interviewinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a uniquely awkward, occasionally overwhelming show – whose finale has to be seen to be believedHannah J DaviesMon 26 May 2025 17.50 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 19.20 EDTShareSeason two of the Rehearsal opens in a cockpit, where the atmosphere is almost unbearably strained. With the plane apparently on a collision course (“we have those hills to the right of the airport, remember?!”), the co-pilot begins to panic, but the captain haughtily dismisses his colleague’s concerns. Sure enough, the plane begins to plummet, before crashing into a fiery wreck. We zoom out to reveal a set, whereNathan Fielderstares and blinks into the camera gormlessly, having conducted this horrifying performance – one of many reconstructions of real-life disasters to come.This is, of course,the comedian’s totally wild docuseries, in which he prepares people for big life events via elaborate (and occasionally unethical) walk-throughs. The first season culminated in Fielder possiblycausing untold psychological damage to a child actor who was only too happy to accept him ashis real dad (he apparently hadn’t grasped the extent to which he was part of anintricate plan to help a woman who wasn’t sure whether she wanted to have kids).This time around, Fielder tells us that he has decided not to involve any children. But if you’re expecting something a little less problematic, you’re in the wrong place. In fact, at the end of the finale (which aired in the US over the weekend), I realised that all I had written for the final 30 minutes was “how on EARTH did they do this????” over and over again, like a bad version of the typewriter scene in The Shining.Indeed, there is much here that will remind you of a horror film, and many scenes you will surely watch with your fingers over your eyes. Which is hilarious, given that the premise of this season is so incredibly mundane.View image in fullscreenTested to destruction … Fielder in season two of The Rehearsal.Photograph: HBOFielder has theorised – largely through careful study of thousands of pages of dry government documents – that plane crashes are directly linked to a lack of communication between pilots and first officers. His new quest, he says, is to improve aviation safety by forensically analysing how those conversations unfold and how pilots can give one another better feedback. And, er, by creating his own replica of Houston airport.Of course, as he explains to the pilots, actors and experts whom he inveigles into the rehearsal, HBO will only open its chequebook if his potentially life-saving, industry-leading experiment is also a comedy. Cue another six episodes of wondering just how much anyone knows at any one time, as Fielder constructs another televisual hall of mirrors where the fake and the real collide with all the violence of his staged plane crashes.As with season one, the producers have managed to find civilians who are so uniquely awkward that they feel like integral parts of the chaos. These are people who blur the line between committed normie and aspiring actor so well that many have, in fact, been accused of being fake. But they are all real, from baby-faced first officer Moody, who is convinced his girlfriend is cheating on him with her customers at Starbucks, to Jeff, an older pilotwho freely, maybe even proudly, admits that he has been banned from all known dating apps. As always, Fielder gets in way too deep with everyone – not least a lovely young man named Colin, who gets his own rehearsal-within-the-rehearsal about his faltering love life.Alienating, awkward, anxiety-inducing: why The Rehearsal is TV’s most fascinating showRead moreIt’s one of many, many tangents in a series that also touches on dog cloning; Evanescence’s gothy rap-rock hit Bring Me to Life; neurodiversity and mental health; and a fake singing contest called Wings of Voice, which led one contestant, Lana Love, to give a tell-all interview toVarietywhere she angrily stated that she had “signed up to be a singer, not a lab rat”.These strands weave around one another as the supposed goal of improving aviation safety comes in and out of focus. There are frequent links back to Fielder’s previous work, on shows such asNathan for YouandThe Curse, which only makes the whole thing more meta. It does at times feel a little overwhelming, even for a man whose whole thing is essentially artful self-absorption.And yet, navel-gazing and the many ethical questions raised here aside, Fielder pulls it off spectacularly. He shows impressive commitment to the bit in episode three, where he undergoes a physical transformation that is as horrifying as it is sublime. And the last episode sees the end justify the means, as he channels all he has learned into a knockout conclusion. The Rehearsal is frequently plane-crash TV – but my oh my, does it stick the landing.The Rehearsal season two aired on Sky Comedy and is available on Now in the UK, and on HBO Max in Australia.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewNathan FielderReality TVAir transportreviewsShareReuse this content"

But does the story add up?Deborah ColeMon 26 May 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 15.44 EDTShareThe story is almost too compelling to be true: a group of war-weary young women, long deprived of sufficient food, are herded together to dine on abundant vegetarian delicacies three times a day. The only price: risking their lives with each bite as they may have consumed deadly poison intended forAdolf Hitler.The extraordinary account by then 95-year-old Margot Wölk created a sensation when itfirst appeared in a Berlin tabloidmore than a decade ago. Her decision to break what she called decades of silence about her wartime experiences captured the imagination ofGerman reporters, thenglobal media, finally inspiring adocumentary,two novelsanda play.This month, a movie “based on a true story”, will be released in German cinemas, reviving fascination with the curious tale of Wölk and her “colleagues”, as she called them.The Tasters is based on a 2018 Italian historical fiction novel by Rosella Postorino, translated into English as At the Wolf’s Table. Italian director Silvio Soldini said he approached the material as rooted in fact and liked that it turned a spotlight on to a rare women-centred narrative in the still booming market for films about the second world war and the Holocaust.“It was quite unusual – telling for once a storyabout war and violence, without focusing on the man at war,” Soldini said. “Instead we show how these women are affected, in this ‘small’ world in which they are forced to do something awful: constantly play Russian roulette for more than one year.”In Soldini’s film, the protagonist Rosa traces the rough outlines of Wölk’s stranger-than-fiction story, in which Hitler is never seen but whose shadow looms large.The secretary in her mid-20s flees her war-damaged flat in Berlin for her in-laws’ modest house in East Prussia, in today’s Poland – a refuge that happens to be just down the road from Hitler’s heavily guardedWolf’s Lair military headquarters.With her soldier husband missing on the eastern front, Rosa and the elderly couple scrape by on the meagre bounty from their small garden until one day SS officers arrive and bundle her off in a bus.Suddenly she is surrounded by a group of “healthy” young German women – all single or widowed – who are presented with an opulent meat-free feast prepared by a chef in a starched white uniform. But they soon learn there’s a terrifying catch.“There was never meat because Hitler was a vegetarian,” Wölk told German media in 2013. “The food was good – very good. But we couldn’t enjoy it.”View image in fullscreenA stranger-than-fiction story … The Tasters.Photograph: Luca Zontini/Busch MediaWölk said she and 14 other women – in the film the group is half that size – spent more than two years forced to work as food tasters for Hitler, forming a tightknit sisterhood in circumstances beyond their control.During that time, fears for the Führer’s life in his inner circle hurtled between the risk of a poisoning attempt by the allies and the paranoia touched off bythe narrowly failed 20 July 1944 German officers’ bombing plot at the Wolf’s Lair.When the Soviet army finally came closing in, Wölk said she escaped with the help of a Nazi officer on a train to Berlin – scenes suspensefully dramatised in the film. She made it back to the devastated capital alive but later heard that all 14 of her “colleagues” were shot by the Red Army troops.Postorino’s novel, which has not been translated into German, and Soldini’s film largely adhere to Wölk’s spectacular story, while adding flourishes including an affair with a Nazi officer.Scholars have produced detailed accounts of Hitler’s 800 days at the Wolf’s Lair including his legume-heavy diet sweetened by plentiful fruit-topped cakes. As he was teetotal, alcohol wasverbotenin favour of mineral water and the occasional cup of coffee.Journalist and historian Felix Bohr, who has just published Vor dem Untergang: Hitlers Jahre in der Wolfsschanze (Before the Downfall: Hitler’s Years in the Wolf’s Lair), says that as gripping as Wölk’s story is, there is “no evidence” beyond her interviews that it is true.“I spent three years in the archives researching Hitler’s time there and none of the accounts of secretaries, cooks, servants, military staff or other people who were there – up to 2,000 at a given time – mentioned a team of women food tasters,” he said.“The Wolf’s Lair was the most high-security place in all of the so-called Third Reich and so what you did have was an elaborate system to protect the food supply including strict rules for shipping and storage as well as inspections of everything allowed in the restricted zone.”Bohr is at pains to stress that he found no concrete proof that Wölk’s account was untrue, nor did he believe she had wilfully lied in her last years until her death in 2014.“Of course memories 70 years after the war can be deceptive – we’re all marked by the stories we’ve read and seen on television. It’s very possible she was bussed for work duty, something the Nazis did with women all the time. But I think scepticism is called for with the rest of the story.”View image in fullscreenSuspensefully dramatised … Elisa Schlott as Rosa.Photograph: Luca Zontini/Busch MediaAs for the lavish meals, Bohr said his research had turned up frequent complaints by visitors to Hitler’s hidden enclave about the “bland” menu often consisting of bean soup, boiled vegetables and potatoes.Fellow journalist and author Sven Felix Kellerhofffirst raised doubts about Wölk’s story in 2014, noting that Hitler employed two dedicated cooks, both women, who sampled the food for taste and would have been stricken had any fast-acting poison been slipped in.Actor Elisa Schlott, 31, who plays Rosa in the film, says she wasn’t troubled by doubts about the specific veracity of Wölk’s account because her story of suffering and survival remains powerful, especially asyounger Germans today help lift the far-right AfD to record heights in the polls.She says she was “shocked” to learn about the strong support for the Nazis among women at the time “although it was a misogynistic party. It reminded me of today’s‘tradwives’ on social mediawho do everything for their husbands – maybe a similar kind of backlash against progress.”She speculates that Wölk’s wartime ordeal might have distorted her memories in old age.“I see no reason why she would have made it up,” she says. “On the other hand, traumatic experiences in war have an impact on the brain, which is why we can’t be 100% sure.“But this isn’t a film about Hitler,” Schlott says. “It’s about these women and the community they built under the dark cloud of the Nazi period.”Soldini, 66, said nearly half a million people had seen the film in Italy since its release in late March – respectable for an arthouse picture in German with a little-known cast. It also didbrisk business at the Berlin film festival’s European Film Marketin February, selling in several international territories.People are still drawn to war dramas, Soldini says, particularly now in a fraught age “in which the world seems nearer to this story than it was even two or three years ago”.The director chooses to believe Wölk’s story is true. “But if it wasn’t, it doesn’t make much difference to me. The film and the book say something important about power, dictatorship, violence and their impact on women.”Explore more on these topicsFilmAdolf HitlerFoodNazismGermanyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why it’s there is something of a mystery to us both; none of his neighbours have laid claim to it yet and, between the ground and second floors, it’s the lone decoration among a sea of teal tiles. Yet there Amélie is, reading in bed beneath two portraits of a goose and a dog in Elizabethan collar. I smile every time I see the poster, reminded of the sometimes-silly, small pleasures that make life worth living. And better yet, our miraculous capacity for being good to one another.‘Greatest teen movie ever’: why Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging is my feelgood movieRead moreAlthough Amélie was one of the first “adult” films I ever watched, you’d be hard-pressed to find anything very serious in it at all – except, perhaps, for the brief compilation of couples in orgasm. The titular Amélie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is a shy but mischievous waitress in Montmartre, Paris.As a young girl, her mother was killed by a suicidal Canadian tourist who jumped from the roof of Notre Dame. Amélie’s father then becomes increasingly withdrawn and devotes himself to building a miniature shrine to house his late wife’s ashes. It’s a lonely childhood for Amélie, but the tragicomic here skews more comic. A suicidal fish briefly offers her some company, as does her overactive imagination.When Amélie becomes a young woman and the doe-eyed archetype of the early aughts Manic Pixie Dream Girls everywhere, she decides to bring happiness to all those she can. She returns a tin of childhood treasures to a lonely man and plays matchmaker between a waitress and a customer. While escorting a blind man to the Métro, she describes the world around them so that, if only for a moment, he can see it through her eyes.Amélie asks a flight attendant friend to send her father pictures of his garden gnome travelling the world and convinces him to do the same. Nothing, I think, could sum up the film’s intent better than this quote from its narrator: “Amélie has a strange feeling of absolute harmony. It’s a perfect moment. A soft light, a scent in the air, the quiet murmur of the city. A surge of love, an urge to help mankind overcomes her.”I should, ethically, issue a disclaimer here. If director Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s credentials as a French man might lead you to believe that his Paris is a truthful depiction of the place, then you might be mistaken. This Paris is less Godard than it is a Technicolor lovechild of the city we see in Emily in Paris and the one from Ratatouille (the runner-up for my feelgood film of choice). It is fun, fantastical, and simply does not exist. This certainly doesn’t absolve Amélie of,as per one critic’s suggestion, magicking away “the inappropriate realities of poverty and racism”. But these issues are deserving of just a sidelong glance from a feelgood film and there is, I hope, some value in choosing to escape the real world every once in a while.After completing several good deeds, Amélie falls in love with the elusive Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), a sex shop employee who likes to collect strangers’ photobooth pictures. I like that this part reminds me how deeply we can care about people we don’t yet know. Living in as many cities as I have, I am always touched by the kindness of strangers: volunteers at workers’ and tenants’ unions who give their time to help me; bystanders who, at their own risk, have protected me when I’ve been alone on nights out. Although Amélie’s kindness might be the apotheosis of whimsy, it’s radical in its own way – a quiet protest against the indifference and self-interest that seem to rule city life.We see, too, how Amélie delights in tiny joys like cracking creme brulee with a spoon and skimming stones on Canal Saint-Martin. At the risk of being twee, I have also cultivated my own taste for small pleasures over the years. Thumbing through old postcards in antique shops and the sound of woodpigeons in the morning make me very happy, and proudly so. My relationship spawned out of a long-distance friendship fuelled by lengthy exchanges about what we love and thought the other would, too; in Amélie and that fact alone, I feel flooded with the sense that these or things like these can make for a pretty wonderful life.Amélie is available to rent digitally in the USExplore more on these topicsAmelieMy feelgood movieAudrey TautouComedy filmsRomance filmsJean-Pierre JeunetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their 2023 recording of music by the 17th centuryOrazio Benevoli– a leading composer in Rome’s post-Palestrina era – was much admired and they’re now exploring more of Benevoli’s masses for multiple choirs. Bristol’sSt George’s, whose gallery runs on three full sides of the former church, offered an excellent setting.In Benevoli’s Missa Angelus Domini for three choirs of four voices – a single voice to each part as was the usual practice – the complexity of the interweaving lines emerged with clarity, the singing gutsy rather than overly refined. Individual voices were free to come through the texture with colourful flourishes when appropriate, the primacy of the text paramount and the two chamber organs and theorbo added subtle detail.This programme’s overall theme was the feast of Pentecost, with Palestrina’s motet Dum Complerentur – the mighty rushing wind of the Holy Spirit reflected in graceful ascending phrases – preceding Benevoli’s Missa Dum Complerentur for four choirs, plus four doubling choirs. I Fagiolini voices were now divided into two choirs on stage and two choirs above them on either side, with the four further choirs – theBristolUniversity Singers, schooled by Hollingworth – strategically positioned around the gallery, surround sound baroque-style. Familiar as this might be in Venetian composers such as Giovanni Gabrieli, Benevoli’s more modernist approach clearly sought new effects. The choirs’ antiphonal exchanges were striking, with the lines where entries in close imitation by the four doubling choirs moving round the auditorium sounding quite magical. The cumulative wonder of the Credo’s final Amen alone felt like justification, were it needed, for Benevoli to be better acknowledged.In both these masses, Hollingworth interpolated a different composer between the Gloria and the Credo. Greg Skidmore was the dramatically expressive soloist in Audio Coelum from Monteverdi’s Vespers, the echoing voice at the back of the gallery giving the spatial dimension here. Infantas’s Loquebantur Variis Linguis for eight voices was a startlingly intense experience, again underlining how refreshing and welcome I Fagiolini’s advocacy of such less well-known repertoire is.At theStour festival, Kent, on 22 JuneExplore more on these topicsClassical musicChoral musicBristolreviewsShareReuse this content"

Still, two decades after their acrimonious split, the trio’s fourth album The World Is Still Here and So Are We – their first in 21 years – is getting rave reviews and they’re playing to packed houses. “Three songs in and we’ve already broken a guitar string,” sighs singer and guitarist Andrew “Falco” Falkous, insisting: “That’s not a badge of honour. It’s a technical problem.”The frontman’s ongoing struggles with tinnitus and hyperacusis mean he now has to perform wearing noise-cancelling headphones and needs a plexiglass sound barrier around Jack Egglestone’s drum kit, but with new bassist Damien Sayall thrashing away like his life depended on it they’ve lost none of their intensity. Their furious songs suggest a British Jesus Lizard or Fugazi, but the reflective She Will Only Bring You Happiness or hypnotically groovy new People Person take them somewhere else entirely.Meanwhile, Falco’s dizzying imagery and teeth-gritted delivery suggest a brilliantly absurdist wordsmith and wit in the tradition of Pere Ubu’s David Thomas or the Fall’s Mark E Smith. “Your heart’s gone the colour of Coca-Cola”, the singer yells at one point. “Your mother was a ballpoint pen thief” at another. When he cries “I’m just a normal man!” with the music as taut as a stretched elastic band, it’s dazzling.View image in fullscreenStill intense … Mclusky.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianBack in the day, singles with titles such as Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues or the superb Alan Is a Cowboy Killer were never destined to go Top 20, but are now greeted like old friends, with newbies such as Way of the Exploding Dickhead running them close already.

The initials stand for “length over all” – or what one aficionado he interviewed calls “phallic sizing”. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, before he got the idea of sending celebrities like Katy Perry into space, commissioned a $485m yacht called Koru. With its towering masts, the 127 metre-long boat proved too tall to pass beneath Rotterdam’s famous Koningshaven Bridge, and while its manufacturers suggested dismantling the bridge, rather than the yacht, the heroes of that particular story – the Dutch – refused.I had a similar problem recently. Delivery people couldn’t remove our old fridge because we had, in the interim, narrowed the hall with an understairs cupboard. In that moment, I identified with Bezos. True, as Osnos reports, one well-stocked diesel yacht can produce as much greenhouse gas as 1,500 passenger cars, while my broken fridge produces none, but the parallel remains.In 1990, there were 66 US billionaires; by 2023 there were over 700In this droll and timely analysis of extreme wealth, New Yorker staff writer Osnos notes that superyacht demand is outstripping supply. In some countries you have to wait for bread, water or inoculations; in others for giant sea-going vessels. In 1990, there were 66 US billionaires; by2023there were over 700, an increase of more than 1,000%. In the same period, the number of US yachts measuring longer than 76 metres has gone from “less than 10 to more than 170”. Median US hourly wages, in contrast, have risen by just 20%. Maths is not my strong suit, but this suggests inequality is spiralling.There’s also a spiralling inequality in political power. Trump postures as a president for blue-collar Americans, but the people who shared the stage when he took his oath of office on 20 January tell another story. In that symbolic moment Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Bezos and Sergey Brin showed their influence was rising with their net worth. “The world watched America embrace plutocracy without shame or pretence,” writes Osnos.Meanwhile, shame and pretence are in plentiful supply elsewhere. One yacht owner tells Osnos: “No one today – except for assholes and ridiculous people – lives on land in what you would call a deep and broad luxe life. Yes, people have nice houses and all of that, but it’s unlikely that the ratio of staff to them is what it is on a boat. Boats are the last place that I think you can get away with it.”In other words, the modern versions of Hearst Castle and Blenheim Palace are discreetly mobile, able to whisk themselves out of sight at a moment’s notice. It dovetails nicely with a political agenda best articulated by Peter Thiel. The venture capitalist, Osnos reports, gave start-up capital to the Seasteading Institute, which seeks to create floating mini-states – part of his libertarian project to “escape from politics in all its forms”. And, presumably, to “get away with it”.In any event, it’s not just how big your superyacht is, but what you put inside it. The latest fashions include Imax theatres, ski rooms where guests can suit up for a helicopter trip to a mountaintop, and hospital equipment that enables onboard pathogen tests. That last detail is key: Covid accelerated the desire of the super-rich to get away by any means necessary from, with due respect, plebs like you and me.The have-yachts seem to be following the Thorstein Veblen playbook. When the economist wrote The Theory of the Leisure Class in 1899, he argued that the power of “conspicuous consumption” involved revelling in showy wastefulness. You’ll be wanting a personal submarine for your yacht, not to mention eel and stingray leather for its upholstery. Osnos lists what can be delivered to your watery fastness: Zabar’s bagels, rare melons from Hokkaido, Dom Pérignon, sex workers. Ocado needs to up its game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Superyachts are a terrible asset class in that they lose value faster than you can say bonfire of the vanities. “Owning a superyacht is like owning a stack of 10 Van Goghs,” argued the Financial Times, “only you are holding them over your head as you tread water, trying to keep them dry.” But then again, as Veblen understood, maybe that’s part of the point?The Haves and Have-Yachts: Dispatches on the Ultrarich by Evan Osnos is published by Simon & Schuster (£22).

Exact date unknown.Photograph: World History Archive/AlamyBiography booksReviewGertrude Stein: an Afterlife by Francesca Wade – how a literary legend was madeA thoughtful biography sheds new light on the motivation behind Stein’s masterwork, The Autobiography of Alice B ToklasKathryn HughesMon 26 May 2025 04.00 EDTShareWhen The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas was published in 1933, it made 60-year-oldGertrude Steinfamous after decades of obscurity. The book painted a thrilling picture of life among the Parisianhaute bohèmein the early years of the 20th century. Picasso, Matisse, Scott Fitzgerald and Ezra Pound all made repeat appearances at the apartment in Rue de Fleurus which Stein shared with her partner Toklas. After decades of pushing language to its limits, Stein had written The Autobiography in a comparatively accessible style with jokes and anecdotes and full sentences. Or, as one relieved critic noted at the time, Gertrude Stein had finally started making sense.In this thoughtful and deeply researched book, Francesca Wade explains that the success of The Autobiography had the unintended effect of moving the focus from Stein as a writer to Stein as a celebrity. While she loved the fame and money, what Stein really wanted was to be acknowledged for her earlier, more radical work in which words were set free from the shackles of meaning and grammar. The fact that her epic The Making of Americans, composed between 1902 and 1911, failed to find a publisher until 1925 had meant that James Joyce and TS Eliot, whose respective breakthroughs came in 1922 with the publication of Ulysses and The Wasteland, were regularly hailed as the founders of literary modernism. This left Stein looking like a latecomer or, worse still, a copycat.To have a chance of asserting her primacy, Stein wanted her entire archive, published and unpublished, novels as well as shopping lists, deposited at Yale where it would be made available for generations of scholars and critics (not biographers, whom she hated). Their job, as she saw it, would be to restore “Gertrude Stein” to her rightful place as the true originator of what she called “modern writing”. Mostly, the plan worked. Gradually the suggestion that Stein was a pretentious fraud faded away to be replaced by the idea she was a dazzling innovator who had blown the cobwebs off literary language and ushered in an entirely new way of recording human experience.By giving her book the subtitle “An Afterlife”, Wade signals that it is this process of making and remaking Gertrude Stein’s posthumous reputation that is her main focus. So it is odd that she spends half her lengthy text retelling Stein’s very well-known life, from the early days as a medical student in Baltimore to the last scary years hiding out from the Nazis in the French countryside (although they seldom acknowledged their Jewishness, Stein and Toklas knew that they were at high risk of being sent to a concentration camp). As a result, it is not until page 204, following Stein’s death from cancer in 1946, that Wade embarks on the more interesting and original aspects of her investigation.At this point we are introduced to a new cast of characters – the librarians, academics and even despised biographers – who pile into Yale and rifle through the enormous archive. Inevitably there are rivalries and fallings out. One of the chief actors is Leon Katz, who interviewed Toklas in the winter of 1952 and plucked up the courage to show her a vitriolic attack that Stein had written in 1907 describing her future life partner as “ungenerous, conscienceless, mean, vulgarly triumphant and remorselessly caddish, in short just plain low”. Katz guarded his notes like a terrier, even refusing to show them to the equally tenacious Janet Malcolm when she was writing her own study of the Stein-Toklas relationship in 2007. But on Katz’s death in 2017 his notes passed into the archive and Wade believes she is the first person to have made use of them, although they were published in 2021.This is a big win, not least because it throws new light on the genesis of The Autobiography. Far from being a celebration of a serene and settled relationship, it now looks as though the crowd-pleasing classic was composed by Stein in a desperate attempt to keep Toklas from storming out after one provocation too many. But if Wade had written a shorter and more focused investigation of Stein’s posthumous reptuation, perhaps it would have showcased her achievement to even better effect.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Their regular informalreadings in Mayakovsky Squareattracted enthusiastic audiences between the late 1950s and 1961, when they were temporarily banned.As a young teen, Voznesensky had sent some verses to Boris Pasternak and been thrilled by the warm response. Perhaps this was an important source of his literary self-confidence. But the boldness seems to have been tempered by a certain personal tact. His early collection, Mozaika, was withdrawn and the publisher, apparently, fired. In 1963, at a Kremlin meeting between writers and artists and the Soviet government, Khrushchev, whose liberalising instinct didn’t extend to questioningsocialist realism, rounded on him and demanded he leave the country. Somehow, Voznesensky evaded the worst outcome: he wrote what has been described as an “ironic recantation” for Pravda, and continued to publish and recite his work. He went on to achieve a rock-star level of fame, giving sell-out readings in both the USSR and abroad. He was awarded the Soviet state prize in 1978.Selling Watermelons is the kind of poem that would please and amuse the home crowd. It’s a gutsy celebration of the suddenly overwhelming seasonal glut of a very desirable product. There’s no moaning about scarcity, although the string-bag mentioned in the last verse is a clue. It was stowed in every shopper’s pocket, just in case a previously unavailable item had suddenly appeared. Now, in the glory of the “melon-multitudes” the bag would be stretched as wide as possible to contain the delicious import – which had probably travelled from Kherson.Edwin Morgan’s translation is alive to the breathless excitement, the counter-sensation of suddenly being able to breathe freely, and the deliciously demonstrative aspect of the whole event. Vendors with busy knives prepare sample slices: customers’ knuckles tap the surface of the uncut fruit to check for that inimitable “resonance” of ripeness. The exhilaration that fills the sharp September air has, of course, a political dimension but this is understated, subsumed in an expression of joy that unites the people and those in power over them.Commended as a Russian translator particularly for his rendering of Mayakovsky into Scots,Morgan (1920-2010), gets the muscles of the English language working with similar vigour in his treatment of Voznesensky. He was a faithful linguistic traveller, not a version-maker, but there are small, important innovations in Selling Watermelons. For instance, assuming the online version of the poem is correctly laid out, the original stanza structure is altered: Voznesensky has three two-lined stanzas, Morgan, only one. This greater compression may reflect Morgan’s concern with emphasising the zingy alliterative contrasts that make all of Voznesensky’s original lines so exciting. Morgan’s lineation jostles the milder English sounds closer together for added impact.There are bold decisions concerning particular words, especially in the first stanza. In the opening line (“Moscow is milling with watermelons”) the original verb, “авалена”(“overloaded”), emphasises quantity rather than movement. Besides avoiding the passive case, Morgan’s present participle, “milling” introduces a verb that evokes weight and, above all, movement. Crowds are “milling” as in the conventional metaphor, and watermelons are constantly changing hands: so, “Moscow is milling with watermelons”. It’s simple and right. “Melonvendors” is another stroke of brilliance. It avoids the Voznesensky’s gender-specific rhyme-word, “продавщиц”,(“saleswomen”) and adds a kind of sound effect.Abundance for Voznesensky creates a mood of freedom, a sense of boundlessness, but his portrait of the city as an image of the prevailing politics is realistic. Perhaps the “chief” invited to “take one” is a party boss recognised by the vendor? Satisfyingly, briefly, power has passed to the latter. It’s in the first lines of the fourth stanza that a more noticeable bit of political mischief appears: “And just as tasty, and just as juicy are / the capbands of policemen”. It’s clearly a joke, but it’s still “edgy”: a military policeman in a good mood could laugh, but, on another day, treat it as an insult.The last quatrain opens out into an image in which the watermelon, ferried home in its plumped-out bag, becomes the world: “the earth swings in its great string-bag / of meridians and latitudes”. It’s as if the markings on the melon’s skin had suggested a vision of the Earth, and all the joyful possibilities of “latitude” and adventure it might hold. These were possibilities ultimately realised by Voznesensky. How grieved he would be that the young poets of present-day Russia, Artyom Kamardin and Yegor Shtovba,cannot share such exhilaration.Selling Watermelons is published in Edwin Morgan’sCollected Translations.

This is not the Renaissance as the textbooks teach it. Dylan MarcAurele’s musical comedy mashes up Medici Florence and high-camp modernity to trace two friends’ journey from gay schoolmates (bit of a historical stretch, that) to the greatest artists of their age. It couldn’t be trashier but in the spaces between art history and anachronism, flamboyant rudeness and lyrical wit, there’s fun to be had.No point pretending Pop Off, Michelangelo! takes much interest in these Old Masters’ art, nor in the era. But it’s all over their queerness – atoning for which drives Michelangelo to dump his BFF and seek Sistine Chapel salvation. But can they swerve the attentions of religious firebrand Savonarola, in an age turning increasingly cynical thanks to pizza chef and aspiring philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli?It is, in short, a kitsch Renaissance cartoon; subtlety is not its selling point. “You truly made marble your bitch,” Michelangelo’s teacher tells him, while Leonardo’s arrest for sodomy is apologised for as follows: “I was so stupid. I thought Savonarola was a stripper.” But if Da Vinci-style depth of field is beyond it, Pop Off, Michelangelo! frolics enjoyably in the foreground. Careerist but concerned Max Eade and sly, soppy Aidan MacColl are an engaging Michelangelo and Leonardo, plotting their respective paths between safety and self-expression.Sashaying around in his golden cape, Michael Marouli’s Pope makes for an amusingly unlikely gatekeeper of the hetero status quo. Laura Sillett gives good “mwa ha ha” as the villainous friar, and Aoife Haakenson contributes an apropos-of-little showstopper in character as a certain movie star from the 21st century. The pop score is perfectly winning, even if Michelangelo’s ballad about God and Jesus fits ill with the part of the story it’s meant to tell. The show’s freewheeling spirit, though, which twins twerking and 1400s Tuscany, and has a notorious puritan fanatic teased for dressing by Temu, is very easy to submit to.At Underbelly Boulevard, London, until 13 July.Explore more on these topicsStageMusicalsComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)TheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Her debutIs It a Bird?wowed the Edinburgh fringe, and made her the first transgender performer to headline the London Palladium. Then she stripped naked on Channel 4’sFriday Night Live, and unleashed a transphobic storm. That’s the context (she’s a huge success; she’s received death threats) for an hour she admits may be subject to “difficult second show syndrome”. Acknowledging that is very on-brand: Gray is self-aware bordering on self-completely-fascinated.And she’s got plenty to be fascinated by: Is That a C*ck in Your Pocket … showcases a performer with lashings of panache and no filter. In song and standup, the show opens on the attack, with joke after joke about her status as a woman with talent, a ravening ego – and with a penis too. One song, from an act oft-likened in flamboyance to her Essex compatriot Russell Brand, tells us she wants to “fuck myself with my own dismembered shlong”. Several gags recycle old-school sexism into edgy gender-bending humour. Another routine itemises the four categories of death threat she’s received.‘I’m literally an X-Man’ – is trans comic Jordan Gray the next stage of human evolution?Read moreJust as Gray feared, it’s not as big-hitting a show as her first. There’s some filler: a weak skit about her Czech wife’s malapropisms; another about Martin Luther King. There’s an emotive finale addressing the difficulties of being trans in 2025 – but it’s hard to take at face value, because nothing hitherto invites us to take Gray remotely seriously. She’s a brilliant entertainer, and a wind-up merchant, but she’s also a bundle of contradictions, her standpoint shifting according to whatever’s likely to be funniest or most outrageous at any given moment.Here, that includes a defence of Donald Trump’s “grab ’em by the pussy” remarks, lots of very funny gags tilting at straw men (and some not-so-straw men) in the gender wars, and an explosive denouement with a fantastic callback spring-loaded inside it. It adds up to a strong sophomore offering, which – if it doesn’t soar quite as high as Is It a Bird? – will easily keep Gray’s career airborne.AtSoho theatre, London, until 31 May; then atPiccolo Tent at Assembly George Square Gardens, Edinburgh, 30 July to 24 August.Explore more on these topicsComedyTransgenderEdinburgh festival 2025reviewsShareReuse this content"

It starts out as a serious well-researched drama about an army veteran with PTSD sleeping rough in Dublin, and ends in bloody revenge, with Aidan Gillen in ultraviolent mode and gangsters drilling holes into each other’s kneecaps.The movie is grounded by a rock solid performance from the film’s co-writer Luke McQuillan as former soldier Danny, who loses his family and home after a tour in Afghanistan. There’s a scene early on that feels horribly truthful about the day-to-day reality of being homeless: late one night, three lagered up youths humiliate Danny for a laugh – forcing him in front of the camera as they shove a coin into his hand. The shame on his face as they film him is harder to watch than the electric drills later that come later.Flashbacks show us how Danny’s family life fell apart. There was an accident involving his little boy when Danny was looking after him; so when he meets a teenager called Will (Daniel Fee) sleeping in woods, Danny’s instinct is to protect him – a second chance to get it right, perhaps. There is nothing particularly new about this story, but McQuillan plays Danny with real care.Here’s where Gillen muscles in as a gang boss called Power, a man who takes a spider’s pleasure in getting people exactly where he wants them. Teenager Will was dealing drugs for Power, until his mum flushed his stash down the loo. Now he’s in trouble. Gillen plays Power with his trademark soft-spoken menace, but somehow it doesn’t stick here, even with the added nastiness of his character having a sadistic habit of killing dogs. At times this is a film that doesn’t feel like quite enough, at others it’s a little bit too much.Amongst the Wolves is on digital platforms from 2 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsThrillersCrime filmsIrelandEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

He therefore had an almost ideal background for a nuanced, detached perspective on the impossibly (and enduringly) painful subject of French collaboration with the Nazis during the second world war.This was the basis of his four-and-a-half hour masterpiece The Sorrow and the Pity from 1969, commissioned by French TV (which refused to screen it); however, it gained an Oscar nomination and its international reputation grew from there. The film was in two parts, The Collapse, about the invasion, and The Choice, about the factional splits on the subject of resistance. It was an unflinchingly tactless and powerful look at what amounted to France’s traumatised recovered memories.View image in fullscreenMasterpiece … a still from The Sorrow and the Pity.Photograph: Norddeutscher Rundfunk/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockFor decades since 1945, France had been content to see its wartime self as martyred and embattled, enduring occupation as a tragic reversal, an almost spiritual ordeal like the trial of Joan of Arc. And for the most part, its former allies gallantly participated in this view – especially the British, who for all their Churchillian euphoria, were quietly aware that if things had gone differently, they too might have collaborated with the invader. One of the most remarkable parts of The Sorrow and the Pity is the interview given on the subject in fluent French by Anthony Eden (who audiences might have then known chiefly as the prime minister who partnered with the French over the Suez fiasco). Ophuls shows him as genial, clubbable, worldly and rather melancholy.The film, and Ophuls, punched a hole through France’s self-excusing myths and saw something nastier, shabbier, more political, more human: a society that embraced xenophobia and informing on your neighbours and in which antisemitism came to the surface. The Sorrow and the Pity takes its place with the great political movies by French directors: Jean Renoir’s The Rules of the Game (1939), Henri-Georges Clouzot’s The Raven (1943), Louis Malle’s Lacombe, Lucien (1974) and, of course, Claude Lanzmann’s Shoah (1985). The title of The Sorrow and the Pity is one of the most brilliant things about it; it is taken from a comment by a pharmacist interviewed by Ophuls who said these were the two emotions he chiefly experienced at the time. Really? Ophuls cleverly allows the audience to suspect that these were emotions experienced after, not during the Occupation, in which fear and rage and shame were perhaps stronger; sorrow and pity were the dramatic reflexes which France found to make the memories bearable and that pity has a fair bit of self-pity.

In this extract from his new book,Ryan Gilbeytakes a fresh look at the ‘queerbaiting’ conundrumRyan GilbeyMon 26 May 2025 00.00 EDTShareJustin Kelly and I first met in 2008 when I was sent to Los Angeles to interview Gus Van Sant. I breezed into the screening room where Van Sant was viewing a rough cut of his film Milk, and promptly tripped over the film-maker’s Australian shepherd Milo, who was snoozing in the dark. Kelly was minding the dog that morning, so in some small but unshakable way I will always blame him for my spectacular stumble.Kelly was the editorial assistant on Milk, which starred Sean Penn asthe assassinated San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, and James Franco as his lover. Kelly then went on to direct Franco on two occasions as gay characters based on real people: activist Michael Glatze, who renounces his former life after finding religion inI Am Michael; and the escort, porn producer and convicted murderer Joe Kerekes inKing Cobra. Consequently, Kelly has had a ringside seat for the whole “queerbait” argument over whether straight or apparently straight actors should play LGBTQ+ roles.Imagine ScarJo at the Oscars for playing a trans gangster – that would’ve been major“I never saw James’s performances as him ‘pretending’ to be gay,” he tells me from among the jaunty cushions in his mother’s guest bedroom in Prescott, Arizona, where he has stopped off during a road trip. “I just saw him as being interested in playing all kinds of characters. He knew he could help these cool queer movies get made and give someone like me a chance to direct. When we were doing press, journalists would throw him some shade, and I’d be like, ‘He’s bringing these incredible queer stories to the screen, so what’s the problem?’”View image in fullscreen‘This is what we’ve been asking for’… film-maker Justin KellyPhotograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty ImagesThe term “queerbaiting” wasn’t in circulation when I Am Michaelopened in 2015. “Once it started floating around, I became very irritated by it,” Kelly says. “I think it’s fucking bullshit. Since before Stonewall, gay people have been asking the straight world to accept us and not treat us differently. And now we finally have these huge names – actors, musicians – telling the world that not only should you not be homophobic but that maybe it’s fucking cool to be gay … and people aremad? I’m like, ‘What is wrong with you?’” He is laughing and spluttering. “That’s what we’ve been asking for all this time!”Such complaints may be guided partly by the misapprehension that work is being snatched away from LGBTQ+ talent. “Dare I veer into a controversial example?” asks Kelly. “Scarlett Johansson was going to play a trans character, then people raised hell, so she dropped out.” He is referring to the still unmade Rub & Tug, for which Johansson was cast as the real-life trans male gangster Dante “Tex” Gill, beforeshe stepped down from the filmin 2018. “It would have been a great story to get out there. Who knows how many people it would have inspired? But it fell apart. And now that movie is gone. I think queer people should feel bummed about that. I mean, imagine ScarJo at the Oscars for playing a trans man: that would’ve been major. The important thing to remember is – guess what? – famous actors get indie queer films financed. And we need visibility.”After twice working with Franco, who spent more than a decadeteasing the world that he might be gay, Kelly directed Kristen Stewart in JT LeRoy, about a notorious real-life literary hoax. Until Stewart came along – and came out – no other modern performer of comparable calibre and status had expressed queer sexuality so emphatically through their choices of roles. In JT LeRoy, she stars asSavannah Knoop, a non-binary artist who agreed to pose as the (male) author of a brace of queer novels that were in fact the work of Knoop’s older sister-in-law.View image in fullscreenPulled out … Scarlett Johansson, left, and the trans gangster Dante ‘Tex’ Gill, whom she was going to play.Composite: AFP/Getty Images/ Pittsburgh Post-Gazette via APStewart has also been revelatory as a diffident night-school teacher pined over by a timid student in Kelly Reichardt’sCertain Women, and as a queer, steroid-pushing gym boss in Rose Glass’s lurid B-movie-style rompLove Lies Bleeding. Much of the frisson in her two films with Olivier Assayas – Clouds of Sils Maria and Personal Shopper – derives from the effect of her being not quite tangible, or just out of reach. In both, Stewart is a peripheral or ephemeral figure: a curious position for one of the world’s most photographed faces. Personal Shopper, JT LeRoy and Spencer, in which she plays Princess Diana,all provide Stewart with fastidious scenes of dressing and undressing that hint at the divestiture or cultivation of layers, defences and secrets. The sense is that the actor is exposing some unseen inner dimension, expressing her own queerness through a series of masks.Kristen brought her girlfriend to our meeting and I thought: ‘Ooh, I know she’s gay and no one else does’Attaching Stewart to JT LeRoy was nothing short of a coup. She came out publicly on Saturday Night Live in 2017, being greeted with cheers after describing herself as “like, so gay”. Kelly had met her a few years earlier to discuss the script, which he and Knoop adapted from Knoop’s book Girl Boy Girl: How I Became JT LeRoy. “Kristen made it clear that she’d brought her girlfriend with her,” he says, “and I remember thinking, ‘Ooh, I know she’s gay and no one else does!’”It took several years to secure financing. So why did Stewart hang on? “She was very connected to the material. I brought it up one time when we were shooting in Winnipeg. We would go to this small-town gay bar where everyone would stare and send over drinks. I told Kristen, ‘Part of me was wondering if you were gonna get 5,000 other great offers and bail.’ And she said, ‘I would have done this movie at any point. I was afraid it might never happen because it’s such a cool story that it could have been too cool for people to put money into, or to understand.’”View image in fullscreenConcealed identities … Kristen Stewart with Laura Dern in Kelly’s film JT LeRoy.Photograph: Buffalo Gal Pictures/AllstarThe timing couldn’t have been better. “Since she wasn’t officially out when she signed up, she jumped at the opportunity to play Sav, who was not just a lesbian but a queer woman who now identifies as non-binary – but at that time did not. There are already non-binary aspects to the character in the movie, though, in all the going back-and-forth between being a boy and a girl.”Stewart worked closely with Knoop. “Kristen and Sav really hit it off. Sav’s a true artist: their whole style, their clothing. They wear the weirdest shit, it’s fucking incredible. Kristen was so into them as a person. One of the things she brought, I think, came from not being out at that point. Sav, the character, was pretending to be JT while also in the closet about being potentially trans and potentially non-binary, and not knowing how to put that out into the world. And Kristen was going through a similar thing: at that level of fame, you’re potentially gonna get attacked or ostracised for coming out. That idea of hiding part of one’s identity was something she wove into the character so beautifully in these very quiet ways. You can see in a lot of her roles that she’s dealing with identity. As Princess Diana, she’s trying to figure out who she is as someone who doesn’t want to be that famous.”Her performance in Love Lies Bleeding, though, is the one that Kelly maintains is the closest to theKristen Stewarthe knows. “In JT LeRoy, she was playing someone so different from herself, even though there was that connection of both having a secret. Whereas I saw more of Kristen in Love Lies Bleeding, more of the real person in terms of being a badass bitch. I think it was a chance for her to do so many things she’s always wanted to do. To play a version of herself and to be super-fucking-gay. To have those sex scenes, the stuff about fingering, the ‘I wanna spread you’ line, licking the protein shake that spills on her girlfriend’s body, taking men down. All things that I believe she was dying to put out there.”View image in fullscreenLurid romp … Kristen Stewart with Katy O’Brian in Love Lies Bleeding.Photograph: Anna KoorisLooked at from this distance, I Am Michael and JT LeRoy play like cracked mirror images of each other. Both are inspired by real-life identity crises and capitalise on the actors’ off-screen baggage. Just as Stewart’s experience of being in the spotlight while hiding parts of herself informed JT LeRoy, so Franco’s teasing about his own sexuality enhanced I Am Michael, a film that hinges on the sincerity or otherwise of his character’s conversion. A formerly gay man trying to convince the world he is now straight was being played by a straight actor who had long hinted that he might be gay.“I don’t think I was conscious of it at the time,” says Kelly. “But now you bring it up, it probably did help. We’re watching this guy question his sexuality. It might also have helped him play the character as well. I don’t know whether James is gay or not.” He smiles. “I mean, everyone’s a little bit gay, so …”This is an edited extract from It Used to Be Witches: Under the Spell of Queer Cinema by Ryan Gilbey, published on 5 June by Faber.

Now he gets paid to lead sheepdogs and labradoodles around Edinburgh’s Braid hillsPaula CocozzaMon 26 May 2025 01.55 EDTShareBrendan MacNeill had wanted to be a photographer since he was a child, and he spent more than 40 years studying and working in the field. But the economic uncertainties of freelancing meant it never really felt like a dream come true and, last year, he “woke up on the first working day of January, and decided something had to change”. Within a week, he hadset himself up as a dog-walker. He was 67.MacNeill lives in Edinburgh’s Southside, near the Braid Hills, so he already had a perfect workspace close to hand. He had an old estate car. And it was easy enough to set up a website for his business. Now he cares for eight dogs a week, among them an old English sheepdog, a cocker spaniel, a sproodle, a labradoodle, a pomeranian-husky mix, and his own chocolate labrador, Molly.“Four mornings a week, I’m up those hills at 8.30. I have them all in the back of the car, and when we arrive they get hyper, barking: ‘We’re here! We’re here!’”In winter, he crests the hill when it’s barely light, and the land, and Edinburgh, fall away at his feet. “I’m not big on Zen and the art of mindfulness or anything like that. But it’s just great to be out in a beautiful setting.”It might sound silly but it’s lovely to have time with dogs who appreciate being out with youFor MacNeill, the hardest part of starting a new career was letting go of the old one. He grew up in Dublin and, at the age of 10, was immediately captivated when his brother showed him a negative and its corresponding photograph. “To me, photography was magic, and always has been.”He turned his bedroom into a darkroom. “It was somewhere to escape to.” As a teenager, at the weekend, “I used to get on the bus, go into town and walk around for hours with a camera, finding shots. It was about me being on my own.”MacNeill was one of seven children. “Nine people in a family, in a not very big house. You tend to carve out a bit of space for yourself.”He did a degree in photography at the Polytechnic of Central London, and later got jobs assisting photographers, then concentrated on his own “black-and-white arty landscapes”. He did corporate work, freelanced for the Scotsman, then specialised in hospitality. But work was a battle.View image in fullscreen‘I’m the boss out there. I’m the magnet’ … former photographer Brendan MacNeill on the Braid hills, Edinburgh.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian“There was always a nagging sense of impostor syndrome … Getting doors to open was something I found difficult. Waiting for the telephone to ring was the worst thing. And trying to figure out, how do I get it to ring?“As I got older, the gap between me and the people who were commissioning work got bigger and bigger. So many contacts are made in social situations.” With technology democratising photography, he felt his role had become cheapened. “Valueless would be a better word.”Even so, letting go of the sense of himself as a photographer was difficult. Last month, he gave up his domain name. “I thought: ‘Right, we’re done.’” He is slowly selling off his kit. It’s noticeable that his dog-walking business –Brendan the Dog Walker– feels like a statement of identity.“I’m in a much more secure and positive frame of mind about what I’m doing,” he says. “You’re there. You’re in charge. The dogs are loving it. They’re looking to you for a bit of direction and leadership on the hill. You’re giving them treats. I’m the boss out there. I’m the magnet. I say to them, ‘Come on, we’re going this way’, and they follow. It’s a very different mindset from photography.A new start after 60: I did my first pull-up at 63 – then fought to be a ninja warriorRead more“Some people might think that sounds very simple, silly … But it’s lovely to have time with dogs who appreciate being out with you.”The cashflow is more reliable than freelance photography. There is a sense of community among other dog walkers: “They’re incredibly encouraging. Any advice you need, it’s there.” And MacNeill says his mental health has improved: “getting up in the morning, having a bit of structure to my Monday to Friday”.There was magic in the darkroom. But, now, “magic is being able to pick up the dogs and have a really nice walk with them.”Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60PetsDogsSmall businessEdinburghfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how I brought some mindfulness to my mindless consumptionMoya CrockettMon 26 May 2025 05.00 EDTShareSometimes, you don’t realise a habit is odd until you mention it casually and people stare at you as if you’d grown a second head. Last year, I mentioned my shopping lists in front of my parents. These lists, stored in the notes app on my phone, are not where I write down things I want to buy (although I have one of those too). Instead, they are a meticulous record of everything I’ve already bought.One list is for groceries, divided into categories (dairy, fresh vegetables, tins) to reveal everything I have in the fridge and cupboard at any given time. The other list covers almost everything else. There are sections for books, makeup, clothes, miscellaneous practical items (batteries, vacuum cleaner filters, a new bike lock) and more. Transient purchases that don’t take up space in my life – takeaway coffees, magazines, bus fares – don’t go on the list. But almost everything else does.“This is weird,” said my dad, vaguely appalled, when I explained the lists to him. “I mean, what’s the point?”What’s the point? In short, the lists help me feel in control of my consumption. I started them before the pandemic, when I felt I was losing track of where exactly my money was going. I am a fundamentally disorganised and messy-brained person who is prone to impulse buys and won’t keep track of, say, whether I’ve already bought oat milk this week.I can’t remember where I got the idea. Keeping a written log of your spending is a fairly standard piece of budgeting advice, but I don’t write down prices (my banking app shows me how much I’m spending on different categories each month). My lists are a reminder of what I’ve bought, not how much I’ve spent. And I quickly realised this straightforward hack could help me avoid unnecessary purchases. For example: if my grocery list shows I’ve got plenty of vegetables languishing in the fridge, but no grains, I know what to prioritise on my weekly food shop‘My house filled with stuff while my bank account drained’: how I stopped impulse buyingRead moreThe other list helps me resist more frivolous spending. As a millennial, I was raised to see shopping as a leisure activity, and I suspect I’ll always have the urge to waste money on things I don’t need and can’t really afford – a new top here, an expensive moisturiser there – as a shortcut to feeling excited, confident or satisfied. Now, when I feelthe pull of a 1970s shirt on Vinted, I can look at my list and see that I’ve already added two new tops to my overstuffed wardrobe this year. Often, that reminder is enough to make me step away from the resale apps and find something else to do.The lists haven’t sucked all the joy out of shopping. I’m still susceptible to the unexpected delights of a posh deli or Lidl’s middle aisle – and no matter what my list says, I’ll never feel as if I have enough vintage jackets. But in a world where targeted ads and contactless payments make it perilously easy to spend without thinking, I’m glad I’ve found a strategy that helps me put more thought into what I buy.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe one change that workedShoppingConsumer spendingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I learned this first-hand as I dropped luggage repeatedly from a stepladder on my driveway, all in the name ofour best suitcases group test.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Filter team and its writers think carefully about how to test each type of product before we embark on a review. Suitcases are often marketed (but seldom rated) on their toughness, so we decided to add drop-testing to our approach, along with conventional criteria, such as internal organisation and finish. Anyone can tell you why they think a suitcase is nice, but we wanted to see how well each option might endure.And so, one fair May morning, I put on my best baggage handler cosplay (hi-vis vest; gloves; boots; possibly ill-chosen hard hat) and wheeled eight fabulous suitcases on to my driveway. They looked unsuspecting in a line against the garden wall.Photographer Christian Hopewell and I discussed the plan over coffee. I would pack each suitcase with baggage (my laundry!), before carrying it up a stepladder and dropping it three times – on to its top, front and side. We’d assess the damage to each suitcase after the third drop.A gif of Pete Wise standing on a ladder and dropping a suitcase from the topVideo: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianI took an impish delight in the testing. Moving each case to the appointed angle required some elaborate flicks of the wrist, especially as my arm grew tired from hauling the luggage and holding it aloft. The suitcases thudded to the ground, sometimes sustaining scuffs, scratches and even cracks, but usually holding up impressively. A few passersby peered quizzically at the yellow-vested man and his deteriorating collection of luggage (in fact, one of those passersby ended up rehoming a suitcase that was too damaged for resale – the rest were donated to the charityCat Action Trust 1977). My driveway had become a suitcase-testing runway.Even though it gave ultra-hardy luggage like theAwayandHorizn Studiosa chance to excel, drop-testing suitcases might seem like overkill. If you travel by train, sea or road, it’s unlikely that your case will ever fall from such a great height (and that’s one of several motivations to choose these eco-friendlier modes of transport when you can).However, the reality is that bad things do happen to good suitcases – notably when they’re used as hold luggage during air travel. While researching for this article, I was shocked to learn how hard baggage handlers are required to work. One airport worker interviewed by the Guardian said that the average baggage handler has to load about 150 bags within 40 minutes, several times a shift. It would only be human to handle some of those heavy suitcases roughly, or even drop them.I should point out that some of my favourite suitcases, pre-drop testing (such as theIt LegionandAntler Icon), sustained more damage than others when dropped. If you travel infrequently or avoid air travel, you might not need a super-tough case. You could pick one with a softer finish and a lower price instead – just don’t drop it from a ladder.This week’s picksThe best camping mattresses and sleeping mats for every type of adventure, testedFrom stick-on tiles to bookshelves: nine easy ways to update your rental home on a budgetMid-strength drinks are having a moment.

The ease of just unrolling a sheet, scattering it with something delicious and giving it a quick stint in the oven, and dinner has almost cooked itself. This variation, with an olive tapenade-spiked cream cheese base, asparagus and eggs works as well for dinner as it does for a weekend brunch.

If you are lucky enough to have your own patch of land, however big or (for most of us town dwellers) small it may be, there is probably at least enough room for a little grill that will serve you well throughout the summer. But even for those who are garden-less (as we are), there is no reason not to enjoy the delights of a barbecue. Charred smashed burgers are all the rage, and making them using chicken rather than beef lightens the whole thing up. Serve with beautifully grilled asparagus and you have a meal fit for a king.Smashed chicken burgers with harissa tahini, pickled red onions and grilled tomatoes (pictured top)This is all about the preparation, because the actual cooking time is very fast. Make all the components in advance and have everything ready to go, then all you need is a super-hot grill (ideally one with both a heavy flat-iron top and a griddle top) to bring it all together in minutes. This is great, messy party food, and you can increase the quantities to allow for as many people as you want to feed – just don’t forget the napkins.Prep15 minCook40 minMakes4 singleburgers, or 2 double loaded ones4 brioche burger buns,halved2 large plum tomatoes, halvedOlive oil, for drizzlingSea salt1baby gem lettuce, or 1 heart of romaine lettuce, leaves separatedFor the harissa tahini1 smallgarlic clove, peeled and mincedA pinch of table saltJuice of ½ lemon1 tomato, halved and grated, skin discarded20g harissa paste60g tahiniFor the semi-pickled onion1 red onion, peeled, halved and thinly sliced (about 100g)½ tsp salt½ tsp sugar½ tsp sumac1 tbsp red-wine vinegarFor the smashed burger350gchicken mince1 tsp paprika½ tsp ground pimento(allspice)½ tsp saltBlack pepper10g parsley leaves, choppedDrizzle the cut sides of the buns and tomatoes with a little olive oil, sprinkle with sea salt, then set aside. Mix all the ingredients for the harissa tahini to a smooth paste and set aside. Mix the sliced onions with the rest of the pickled onion ingredients and set aside.Mix all the burger ingredients until well combined, then put a little oil on your palms, divide the mix evenly and shape into balls weighing about 90g each. Put each chicken burger on a 12cm square sheet of baking paper and drizzle a little olive oil on top.Fire up the barbecue and set a heavy cast-iron pan on it; if you’re cooking this indoors, set a heavy-based cast-iron pan and a griddle pan on the hob. Put the buns and tomatoes cut-side down on the griddle, until they take on a nice char pattern and a little smoke, then transfer to a plate.One at a time, lay a burger meat-side down on the griddle, and press down on the paper with a flat-bottomed heavy pan to flatten it out to just over the size of the bun. Cook for three minutes, then flip and cook on the other side for two minutes more. Repeat with the remaining burgers.Spread both cut sides of each bun with harissa tahini, then lay a lettuce leaf or two on the bottom bun. Top with a burger, slices of the grilled tomato and some pickled onions Pop on the lids and serve.Grilled asparagus with pistachio, garlic and lime saladView image in fullscreenHoney & Co’s grilled asparagus with pistachio, garlic and lime salad.Celebrating British asparagus is almost like a national holiday; we love the season and wish it was longer.

She made it, relatively speaking, exciting.As the subject of a 2022 documentary called Fashion Reimagined, about her quest to make a fully sustainable collection, she took audiences on the twists and turns of trying to produce garments that were – deep breath – organic, traceable, socially responsible and considerate of animal welfare; produced in the smallest geographic region possible; and using minimal water and chemicals.The film created a buzz in the industry and, while the clothes remained out of the financial reach of many, Powney showed what was possible if (a big “if”) you had the scruples, and were willing to do the legwork – the journey took her to Uruguay, Peru, Austria and Turkey.In its aftermath, Powney became, in her words, “[a] kind of pin-up girl of sustainability”. It didn’t always sit comfortably. “It came with a massive amount of weight and pressure and responsibility, and it wasn’t something I was prepared for emotionally,” she says now over the phone. “I was going to bed at night, not sleeping, [thinking] well how the bloody hell am I going to fix this fashion industry?”View image in fullscreenFrom the Akyn lookbook.Photograph: AkynThe clothes she was shown trying to make in the documentary were for Mother of Pearl, a womenswear label founded in 2002. Over the years, as Powney worked her way up the ranks to creative director, the brand became synonymous with her minimal aesthetic and her sustainability drive. At its height, it was worn by Gwyneth Paltrow and Phoebe Waller-Bridge.After winningthe Vogue award for the best young designer of the year in 2017, which comes with a big cash prize, Powney decided to use the money to create a sustainable collection from field to finished garment. Her quest became the documentary.In the years since, Powney has become known for her activism and tenacity in trying to create a fairer fashion industry. She has also become known for designing very elegant clothes. Then, earlier this year, after 19 years with Mother of Pearl, Powney announced she was leaving – she “wanted to exit, turning 40 I wanted to launch my own brand” and start something fresh, she says.That new brand, of which Powney is founder and creative director, is called Akyn. Why Akyn? The “a”, she says, is for “atelier” and the “kyn” is a play on kinship. It “is very much about the power of community”. Its first collection, which Powney calls “a palate cleanse” launched on Friday. The clothes are elegant and chic; they tap into the same aesthetic that has made the Olsen twins’ The Row tick. There is subtly unusual tailoring, T-shirts that are entirely plain bar a tasselled hem, undemanding dresses with flattering shirring at the waist and Aran knits with the words “peace” and “love” woven into them. “It’s more minimal, it’s more elevated,” she says.Akyn lands at a time whenoverproduction remains rife, with 40% of clothes made each year – 60bn garments – unsold. There has also been increased recognition that buying secondhand clothing is not a magic bullet. As the Or Foundation stated in itsStop Waste Colonialismreport: “The fashion industry uses the global secondhand clothing trade as a de facto waste management strategy.” Curbing consumption – buying better, buying less – is the real answer.Does Powney believe there has been a change in attitude? For one thing, she says, the conversation behind the scenes has shifted. In the past, she would talk to suppliers and they would look at her “like I’m absolutely crazy”, because “no one’s ever asked questions before. No one’s ever visited a wool farm and no one has any clue.”View image in fullscreenMinimal aesthetics … from the Akyn lookbook.Photograph: AkynTen years on, she says it has become more common to ask a supplier: “Is it certified? Can you tell me more about your supply chain?” She says: “We’ve seen a lot of progress in transparency of supply chains or at least having conversations about it.”The same could be said for the consumer, who, in the past, was largely – it feels fair to say – ignorant about sustainable fashion. Now people are more across the language as well as certain basic premises. They know organic cotton is generally better than non-organic, because it is a lower-impact crop; they know thatlyocell, the cellulose-derived fabric made from wood pulp, is better than polyester.But with these conversations, there have also been complications. “We’ve had a massive peak of sustainability chat in the press and via brands but with that has just come an absolute flurry,” says Powney. That flurry being “uncertainty, misunderstanding, greenwashing, a lack of legislation”.The chat around sustainable fashion in the past decade also showed whatwasn’tpossible. Take the example Powney set. If this was what it took to create more ethical clothes, then what hope was there for the wider industry, in general less willing to put in the hard graft? Or for people buying that recycled polyester dress in the hopes of doing a bit better with their fashion choices, but unwilling to alter their shopping habits more deeply? As Powney points out: “Even if you’ve taken a bottle and turned it into a dress, then it’s dead. There’s nothing to do with it and then it’s in landfill and we know it’s not biodegrading.”Anecdotally, it feels like some despair crept in along the way – the idea that if making ethical buying decisions is so complicated, why even bother?Powney plans to approach the conversation differently with her new brand. It has become fairly common to see how many litres of water it took to make your jeans, or how many plastic bottles went into your bag. But without some serious expertise, it is impossible to know what any of that really means.“It’s just a minefield,” she says. “Consumers are so confused. Greenwashing is rife. No one supply chain is the same as the other, which is why capturing data is very hard.” Powney plans to “bring back the narrative of creativity, craftmanship, quality, design,” explaining the amount of work that goes into clothes – “because we’ve lost that in the fast fashion world”.Given the complexities, it is perhaps all the better to have a figure like Powney who can cut through the noise. She describes her Fashion Reimagined journey as “her learning curve” and mentions things such as “fly striking”, “mulesing”, and “microns” – proof, if any were needed, that it is good to have someone to unpick all this. She applies this knowledge “on every single decision I make”, she says.The fly in the ointment, though, is affordability. Akyn will be slightly more expensive than Mother of Pearl, where dresses sold for about £300. In the industry, Akyn is still called “affordable luxury”, because, well, it is, compared with other luxury labels. But still.Of course, everyone can shop more sustainably and cheaply without resorting to fast fashion, given the abundance of secondhand clothes. But is there some hope that prices may come down? For Powney’s brand, no. “I am very small scale and I want to do the fibres correctly and I want people to understand what making real natural organic fibres costs.” But, she adds: “I’m completely choked by being a small business, which means I don’t have power, I don’t have scale.”Here comes the silver lining. There is, she says, “absolutely no reason why other brands cannot do this at lower prices”. She isn’t, she makes clear, talking about “Shein and Asos and Boohoo … that’s just an absolute no hope because you can’t produce clothes at that price.” But there is hope for high street brands, which have “scale and price”. She continues: “Switching to organic cotton is also a completely doable task.” Plus, she adds: “Luxury brands 150 million per cent should be and can be doing this.”With Akyn, Powney is reconnecting with her love of style. Speaking about her time at Mother of Pearl, she says: “I lost sight of a little girl who wanted to be a fashion designer.” Now she is back.Explore more on these topicsSustainable fashionFashion industryinterviewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t doubt it. But now, with the wind getting up and a mist creeping over the ridge, there’s little to see other than the ground at our feet. Which is why my attention is drawn to, shall we say, a canine deposit.“But there are no dogs up here. It’s been two hours and just over four miles since that yappy little mongrel in the last village. And there are certainly no dog walkers; not one hint of another human in this wild terrain. No, the size, shape and furriness of this trailside offering reveal its author was the ancestor of all dogs: a wolf.I reach for my binoculars, but in this mist it’s pointless. Besides, even under blue skies, no self-respecting wolf just sits around to be gawped at. But it’s thrilling to know they’re here; that Europe’s alpha predator, once driven out of Portugal, is making a comeback. Two packs now roam these hills, and this must be one of their calling cards.View image in fullscreenA statue on the route the Romans first took around 200BC.Photograph: Mike UnwinIt’s mid-April, and my wife and I are tramping through Peneda-Gerês national park, in northern Portugal, on day two of a six-day walk withOn Foot Holidays. Our route takes us broadly south, covering 55 miles of mountain, forest and meadow as it winds from the little hamlet of Soajo to the monastery of Santa Maria do Bouro. It’s a decent hike, but each morning our bags are ferried by road to the next night’s retreat, so we need carry only day packs.The park, designated in 1971, lies not far north of the popular Douro valley, but is far off the tourist trail. Amazingly, it remains the only national park in Portugal. And it’s steeped in history: our trail was first blazed by the Romans, as they marched north around 200BC to subdue hostile Celtic tribes and strengthen their hold on the Iberian peninsula.This early in the season, the weather is a lucky dip (May, early June, late September and October are among the best times to visit). We arrive in Porto to showers, scuttling from Dom Luís Bridge to Clérigos Tower, then ducking into the Benedictine monastery for a fado (traditional Portuguese music) performance – which reduces us to tears, despite not understanding a word. Next morning, the skies have cleared. And when we arrive in Soajo – two hours from Porto by train and taxi – we find its stone walls bathed in afternoon sunshine. Fallen oranges litter the cobbles, and a hoopoe intones its hoop, hoop refrain from the church tower beside our B&B.We snake across mossy woods bubbling with birdsong, tumbling rivers on ancient stone bridges and flanks of airy moorlandOn our first day’s walking we strike out south, armed with a hefty packed lunch that includes a slab of traditional Pão de Ló Easter cake from our Soajo host’s family bakery. Our trail snakes through mossy woods bubbling with birdsong, crosses tumbling rivers on ancient stone bridges, and traverses flanks of airy moorland, where Dartford warblers scold from the heather and Iberian wall lizards dodge our advancing boots.It hasn’t taken long to hit our stride. By the end of the day, we have more than 11.5km under our belts. Where possible, we stick to old-school navigation, poring over On Foot’s map and trail notes. Their app provides digital back-up, and reassurance comes from the red-and-white way-markers daubed on rocks and tree trunks – helpful, as not once do we meet another hiker to set us straight.Our bolthole for night two is a cottage in picture-postcard Lindoso village, overlooking a hillside ofespigueiros– the traditional grain stores, raised on stone pillars and crowned with crucifixes, emblematic of this region. We dine at Casa do Destro, devouring the first of the week’s bakedbacalhau(salted cod) andgrelos(turnip tops), washed down with the gentle fizz of a local vinho verde.On day two of our trek, the weather creates another country. Brief windows in the cloud and drizzle reveal a wild landscape, daunting in scale and seemingly more suited to wolves than hikers. At one point, the mist parts around a huge ridgetop boulder that appears – to me, at least – uncannily like a wolf’s head.View image in fullscreenGranaries and stone storage sheds in Lindoso village.Photograph: imageBROKER.com/AlamyToday turns out to be the most arduous and weather-battered of our week. Happily, it culminates in our most luxurious bolthole. Reaching the tiny hamlet of Brufe, after almost 23km, we collapse into the warm embrace of Leiras do Tempo. Two nights here allow us time to recover, dry our gear and admire the views.In the morning, with no imperative to move on, we linger over a lavish late breakfast before setting out for the Casarotas wolf trap. Our itinerary describes this hike as “optional”, but the name is too intriguing to resist and soon we’re tramping back uphill through a yellow blaze of gorse and broom in the sunshine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Believed to date back to the 18th century, it comprises two dry-stone walls that descend a steep hillside in a V-shape, converging on a hidden pit. Here, farmers fearful for their livestock drove wolves down to the bottom and slaughtered them. Today, the walls are lichen-encrusted relics of a bygone age. But the wolves are back. Clearly, they were playing the long game.Farmers fearful for their livestock drove wolves down to the bottom of the pit and slaughtered themTwo days later, we descend even deeper into history. Soon after departing our overnight at Campo de Gerês (more bacalhau; more espigueiros), we join the Roman road – a two person-wide granite contour path that winds south through deep woods of oak and pine. Occasional information plaques and life-sized metal cut-outs of legionaries confirm that we’re on the right track – as do the more ancient milestones left by the Romans themselves.The woods swallow us, and with little by way of modernity to break the spell, it’s easy to fantasise about the imperial troops that once marched here. Run-off from the rains has turned some stretches into a river, making stepping stones of the ancient cobbles. “Must have been tricky doing this in sandals,” says my wife.View image in fullscreenCasarotas wolf trap.Photograph: Mike UnwinI also fantasise about the wildlife of yesteryear. There were bears here back then, as well as wolves. Today, leaf litter excavations betray the presence of wild boars, while the long-horned barrosãcattle that browse in the bracken prompt thoughts of the extinct wild aurochs that once roamed these parts. Nature also brings smaller offerings: a golden oriole flashing through the canopy; orchids bejewelling a hidden meadow; a fire salamander on the track, its vivid black and yellow an unambiguous warning not to touch.It’s early afternoon on day six when the towers of the Mosteiro de Amares appear. This 12th-century Cistercian monastery in picturesque Santa Maria do Bouro is now a classy pousada (hotel): our journey’s end. There is much to explore here – cloisters, orange groves, a pool – and tonight we will dine sumptuously beneath the high stone ceilings. But for now, we collapse in our room with a complimentary port. The mountains loom beyond our window. We didn’t see wolves, but I’d like to think wolves saw us – and that’s good enough for me.The trip was provided byOn Foot Holidays.

And I usually let people in ahead of me if they need to change lanes or enter traffic.So why does it infuriate me so much when they don’tgive a little thank you wave?I don’t expect a medal.

More likely the opposite.My petty gripe: save your leisurely ramble for the park and pick up the pace in the cityRead moreBut still, is it reallythathard to flick your hand up in thanks?I know it’s ridiculously trivial. Somany religions remind usthat the best charity doesn’t seek acknowledgment. The great rabbi Maimonidesranked different kinds of giving, with giving when neither person knows the other’s identity up the top.As Saint Augustine wisely counselled,resentment is a cup of poison you drink while waiting for the other person to die. That person speeding away is already oblivious. My anger is pointless.I know I don’t have to let anyone in. Perhaps driving more selfishly would save me the grief of being so enraged, especially as it’s only a little thing.Or perhaps that’s why it’s such a big deal, because itissuch a little thing.That’s why I’m always scrupulous to put my hand out the window in thanks, just in case the kind person who let me in didn’t see it through the tinting. Only takes a second but makes a big difference.

But choosing colours need not be excruciatingAndrew HerrickMon 26 May 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 18.19 EDTShare“We offer 15,000 whites. Pick any three.”I more often give this advice to female clients, since in 40 years restoring, colour-matching and consulting I’ve seen most domestic decor decisions made by women. Apart from any cultural aspect, studies of human biology suggest a reason: only one in 200 women is colour-blind compared with one in 10 men (even more, I suspect, are partially afflicted). Tetrachromacy – the ability to see a far broader range of colours – is also only found in females.This innate ability to define hues accurately doesn’t stop some women favouring odd colour schemes, I’ve found. I once matched paint to a Melbourne Storm jersey – deep purple, black and bright yellow – for the house and fences of a rugby fan. She showed me the result. I hoped the neighbours liked it; I didn’t. One like-minded young man had me turn the walls and ceiling of hisboydoirvampire-violet to match the satin sheets on his circular bed. “The ladies really go for it,” he later told me, proudly displaying the image of a claustrophobic bat cave, complete with bile-yellow lava lamps.From temporary wallpaper to injections of colour: giving a rented home a makeoverRead moreOf course, these clients are outliers. Most choose subtle hues and wall colours that better reflect light and visually enlarge spaces. But with so much choice, colour schemes can be complex. I’ve known some people who find choosing colours excruciating. This can include industry professionals.View image in fullscreen‘To minimise the stress of TMC (too much choice) I recommend initially choosing just three whites for walls.’Photograph: vintagerobot/Getty ImagesForget perfectionI worked with one notoriously finicky decorator who insisted our restoration team match entire walls to one fingernail-size spot on an 18th-century table. It wasn’t possible, and we told her so, but she insisted, and the result wasn’t what she’d hoped for.This pressure for perfection was evident when I prepared paint and offered advice for The Block contestants in 2023. The show revealed that taste, decorating talent and stamina are not equally distributed, and I often shared the stress, especially when asked to match a deep-green bathroom tile for a frantic participant. The tile’s texture made our $12,000 German colour-matching device useless, so it was down to my eyes. I finally got it – but only after 11 steps, cautiously approaching the desired shade with tiny increments of valuable pigment to avoid overshooting and having to backtrack or, worse, producing a wasteful mis-tint.There’s a kind of meditative fun to be had colouring your worldMy abilities meet their match when it comes to render. When restoring this widely used, problematic surface coating, I’ve found it’s best not to touch up but to repaint entirely. Render’s rough texture prevents accurate machine matching, and its micro shadowing means the identical colour from a flat surface won’t appear the same. As for matching that Block favourite, Venetian plaster, which is variable in colour across broad areas due to its depth and transparency, forget about it. I was also forced to point out that matching from a phone image is never wise. When it comes to accuracy, digital still lags far behind reality.Minimise choice overloadTo reduce the stress of TMC (too much choice) I recommend initially picking just three whites for walls. Most paint companies help by featuring a limited range of “popular” whites, covering the three primary colours in the visible spectrum.These “whites” contain combinations of pigments leaning towards blue (cool), red (warm) or green (neutral). When choosing samples, it helps to keep a “pure” vivid-white swatch as a reference, and fan your shortlisted colours out across one another to distinguish their slight differences.If you prefer a particular colour, ask your decorator or paint mixer to identify the pigments in a formula, or even to combine them without a base to reveal the fundamental hue before it’s “whited” out.View image in fullscreenIt’s important to test paint swatches in varying light conditions for exterior walls too.Photograph: Image by Marie LaFauci/Getty ImagesTest in varied light conditionsOf course, decor colour is influenced by light, and today’s LEDs offer more wavelength range than the warm white of superseded incandescent bulbs. So it’s a good idea to test swatches or sample pots in natural and artificial light before deciding.It’s important outside too. I’ve seen many people unhappy with an exterior grey that turned a shade of puce in afternoon or morning sunlight. Unless you like puce (it originally emulated bloodstains from squashed bugs on French bedsheets) I recommend choosing a neutral, green-based grey. Like whites, most greys (which I find are the hardest colours to match) can be steered in the same three spectrum directions by different proportions of blue-based black, with red and yellow ochre.Avoid the ‘nesting instinct’One of my more unwelcome pieces of advice challenges expectant parents’ “nesting instinct” – the urge to redecorate before the big event. I discourage this for two reasons: it’s stressful; and most paint is toxic. If I can’t persuade the client to postpone the project, I recommend a low VOC product (never oil-based enamels), thoroughly ventilating, staying hydrated (paint’s dryers and oxidants desiccate humans too), and using an activated carbon respirator – or just getting a non-pregnant partner or painter to do the job.The zen of paintingThough painting is painstaking and potentially hazardous work, there’s a kind of meditative fun to be had colouring your world, experimenting with the endless permutations available and then beholding the results – fresh, clean, vibrant spaces that demonstrate your individuality and sense of good taste. Unless you choose puce, that is.Explore more on these topicsHomesInteriorsInterior designPaintingAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But she omits the very words for the events that the UK is purportedly “powerless” to stop. She laments her loss of faith in humanity. I sympathise. But she is not powerless. She is a journalist at one of the most prominent newspapers in the world.Journalists can start by taking the most basic and obvious step of using the correct words. Use genocide to describe a genocide, use murder to describe murder, use ethnic cleansing to describe ethnic cleansing. And tell us, please, who is committing the acts that you feel such anguish about.Powerlessness results from the inability to accurately describe what is happening, to condemn it and encourage readers to take action to stop it, such as protests, boycotts, or petitioning our government.Aymen KhouryLondonI collect river stones. I paint them white, set up an art table at markets, at music venues and on the street at a weekly vigil in Maleny, in Jinibara country. I write the names of the murdered children and people come and paint them, talk about how they feel, say a prayer, have a cry, or just sit with the magnitude of it all. They take the stones home or leave them or gift them – most make a donation. The money goes toOlive Kids, an Australian-registered charity trying to provide for Palestinian children under near‑impossible circumstances.I call them remembrance stones; a friend calls it “craftivism”. For me, it’s just the best idea I’ve got.Steven MoriartyDiamond Valley, Queensland, AustraliaRhiannon Lucy Cosslett’s words resonate deeply with me, and I imagine for millions of others around the world. I have sat with impotent rage at what is being done to defenceless people for more than a year and not knowing what to do with it. While one can blame Israel, what to say of the leaders of the “free world”, the western powers, who have enabled the starvation and destruction in Palestine?Arif PervaizEdmonton, Alberta, CanadaI am also a new mother and Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett has encapsulated how I am feeling absolutely perfectly. From wanting to skip traumatic videos online, yet feeling compelled to watch, to feeling a huge sense of sadness and guilt watching my vibrant, plump baby tucking into his big dinner, acutely aware that many in Gaza at this moment are starving and experiencing unimaginable trauma.The feeling of powerlessness has affected me so much more during this particular humanitarian crisis than any other I can remember. Rhiannon may well be right that moral injury by proxy, while it is nothing compared with the trauma experienced by those in Gaza, might have long-term effects on people witnessing and absorbing so much trauma daily on their devices, but who know there is little they can actually do.Louise PostillPoole, DorsetI am a paediatrician neonatologist. I have been working for six years in international cooperation programmes in Africa, even in unstable countries. Never before I have encountered such a deliberate targeting of health staff and children as I am seeing now in Gaza. If this is not a crime against humanity, I don’t know what else it could be.We will be asked why we kept silent and I don’t want to keep silent. Where is the UN? Why can’t Britain, and European countries as a whole, do more to stop all of this? I wish I could join the doctors trying to save those children now, but it is impossible. Let me invite every reader to stand for those who have no voice and raise the cries of these children to our government.Anna BertiEnfield, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Their capacity to process, annotate and generate texts is transforming scholarly workflows. Yet historians are uniquely positioned to ask a deeper question – who owns the tools that shape our understanding of the past?Most powerful LLMs today are developed by private companies. While their investments are significant, their goals – focused on profit, platform growth or intellectual property control – rarely align with the values of historical scholarship: transparency, reproducibility, accessibility and cultural diversity.This raises serious concerns on a) opacity: we often lack insight into training data and embedded biases, b) instability: access terms and capabilities may change without notice, and c) inequity: many researchers, especially in less-resourced contexts, are excluded.It is time to build public, open-access LLMs for the humanities – trained on curated, multilingual, historically grounded corpuses from our libraries, museums and archives. These models must be transparent, accountable to academic communities and supported by public funding. Building such infrastructure is challenging but crucial. Just as we would not outsource national archives or school curriculums to private firms, we should not entrust them with our most powerful interpretive technologies.The humanities have a responsibility – and an opportunity – to create culturally aware, academically grounded artificial intelligence. Let us not only use LLMs responsibly but also own them responsibly.

This allowed Manuel Weber, of Upemba national park’s department of research and biomonitoring, to snap a quick picture, thought to be the first photo taken of a living Upemba lechwe since it was identified as a subspecies in 2005.The last-ditch race to save the Orinoco crocodile – in picturesRead moreThe antelope stopped for “literally a few seconds”, Weber said.“The feeling was unbelievable, I barely slept the nights before we found it, very worried that we would not be able to do the survey, that we would not find any (in that case we would be responsible for the extinction of a species), and the need to get that photograph to generate the awareness needed to save them,” Weber said.Findingspublished in the African Journal of Ecologyprovide the first population update in more than 50 years.“This is a species on the very brink,” Weber, the lead author, added. “The fact that they’re still hanging on at all is extraordinary, but without urgent protection, they’ll vanish.”The Upemba lechwe is now considered one of the world’s rarest large mammals and is at imminent risk of extinction due to illegal poaching.The number one threat to its numbers is hunting, Weber said. “Up to 22,000 individuals were counted in the early 1970s, that was before the Upemba lechwe was described as a species. In the early 1990s, the meat of dozens was shipped every week to Bukama, the largest city in the area, along the Lualaba River.“I don’t see any problem with meat harvesting by the communities in the landscape, but this is only possible when we have viable populations.

HIV medication programmes have been severely depleted by the cuts.“A commonality about these cases is that some were immunocompromised,” said Richard Mvula, spokesperson for the Lilongwe district health office. Health officials had reported that patients who had been on ART (antiretroviral therapy) had been forced to stop taking their medication because of the drug shortages.HIVcan worsen the risk and severity of mpox, while effective HIV treatment can help manage the risk. People living with HIV, especially those with uncontrolled viral loads, may experience a more severe form of mpox.Malawi had been on alert since theglobal mpox outbreakbegan in 2022 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and several other African countries.The news of the first cases last month prompted fears of an outbreak. While most cases have been restricted to Lilongwe, a two-year-old was found with the condition in Mangochi district, about 150 miles (240km) from the capital.While recorded cases remain low in Malawi, one of the poorest countries in the world, mpox has surged in the region overall. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)reports 52,082 casessince the beginning of 2025, with more than 1,770 deaths during the outbreak as a whole.In a briefing to journalists last week, Africa CDC officials said they were seeing different patterns of transmission between countries. In Sierra Leone, where cases are rising “exponentially”, the clade IIb form of the virus is circulating. In the DRC and its neighbours it is clade Ia and Ib that dominate.They said the continent would need about 6.4m doses of vaccine, but was still far from having that available, with only 1.3m received so far. They also highlighted a lack of testing capacity in many countries, and warned that in Sierra Leone patients were being treated two to a bed.View image in fullscreenA microscope image showing green mpox virus particles within infected blue cultured cells. Scientists say they are seeing different patterns of transmission between countries.Photograph: APMalawi’s health system faces many challenges, including long distances to clinics, insufficient funding, a shortage of equipment and a lack of qualified personnel.In March this year, the Joint UN Programme on HIV and Aids drew attention to the immediate risks of the US funding cuts on HIV programmes in Malawi.The programme cited thousands of HIV prevention drugs (PrEP) which were expiring. It said the government has instructed the remaining implementer to continue with the scaling up of injectable PrEP but to only recruit new pregnant and lactating women.The US government had been providingmore than $350m (£282m) to Malawiannually, according to the US Department of State.Knowledge of mpox around the country is low, reminiscent of the Covid-19 outbreak where myths were rife and people resorted to tree leaves and herbs to cure the symptoms. Thousands of people died.A series of interviews across the capital showed most people have no knowledge of mpox. In central Lilongwe, taxi driver Steven Banda outlined what he knew.“I came across an official from the ministry of health who was explaining about it and advised that we should be careful since it is dangerous. She described the symptoms including swellings, and mentioned some of the districts affected. I’m not aware of any cases in my area or seen anyone suffering from the disease. We don’t know much about it,” he said.Race to combat mpox misinformation as vaccine rollout in DRC beginsRead moreDr Victor Mithi, the president of Malawi’s Society of Medical Doctors, said there is need for significant vigilance among practitioners within hospitals to make sure that “as we perform our day-to-day clinical procedures, we are able to screen those patients that may be having this condition”.“It is a big concern because in Malawi, most people live in crowded houses and still believe that as a form of expression of love, you need to shake hands, you need to hug people and all those things which are basically the risk factors in the transmission of this disease.”Mithi said that with the lessons drawn from Covid-19 and other infectious diseases, Malawi had the capacity to manage mpox, at clinical and community level.“The challenge exists though because of the withdrawal of the US aid; the capacity of our healthcare system is no longer the same. Almost 60% of our healthcare system is donor dependent, of which more than 50% of the donor aid was coming from [the US]. So the withdrawal means that our healthcare system is completely shaken, we are left in a state where we didn’t build internal capacities to sustain ourselves,” Mithi added.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentMpoxInfectious diseasesMalawiAfricaUSAIDAids and HIVnewsShareReuse this content"

The last time a monarch opened a new parliament was in 1957, when Queen Elizabeth gave the throne speech. She subsequently gave a speech in 1977 as part of her silver jubilee tour of Canada.Carney’s invitation to Charles comes against the backdrop of Donald Trump’s repeated threats that the US should annex Canada and make it the 51st state.But when the king gives the throne speech laying out the new government’s goals and its plans to achieve them, he will be tightly constrained by what he can say.“Because we have a constitutional monarchy, the king can only operate inside a box that is defined by parliament – because we don’t want a king, or any unelected person, affecting policy and laws,” said Justin Vovk, a royal historian and author. “Any influence the monarch exerts is done through subtlety.”Vovk points to Elizabeth’s “brooch diplomacy” and her decision touse fashion statementsto telegraph support – or opposition – for political positions and leaders. When she met Trump in 2019, shewore a brooch gifted by Barack and Michelle Obamaand the following day displayed a snowflake brooch given to her by the governor-general of Canada amid tensions between Trump and then prime minister Justin Trudeau.In a similar vein, Charles recently wore a British admiral’s uniform with the insignia of the Canadian military and later planted a red maple tree on the grounds of Buckingham Palace, both actions seen as tacit support for Canada.But a lack of official public statements from the king on threats to Canada’s sovereignty is a reminder that the monarchy relies on the softest of soft power to make its point.“The monarchy is always playing this game of catch-up because they live in a time-delayed bubble. They can’t act until they are given the advice and the permission from the prime minister. Everything is filtered through bureaucratic channels and so by the time the sovereign is able to make a gesture, it usually comes somewhat after the fact ,” said Vovk.“It takes the monarchy time to catch up with the media and the expectations of a constantly changing world.”The US ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra told CBC News his country was “thrilled” the king is visiting – but said there were more straightforward ways to make his point.“If there’s a message in there, there’s easier ways to send messages. Just give me a call. [Mark] Carney can call the president at any time.”During his visit, Charles and his wife Camilla will meet community groups and take part in a game of street hockey, where he is expected to drop the puck. But the visit is also expected to once again revive questions over whether Canadians still want a monarch as their head of state.Mutual bond endures but Canada at a crossroads as king’s coronation loomsRead more“Seeing the royal family in person always stirs up a level of interest in the royal family. And despite the waning interest, it’s much harder to be acrimonious to somebody when you see them in person. But every time we have a major royal event, it does raise questions about the system of government we have. Does it work best for Canada?” said Vovk.A majority of Canadians say they want the system of a constitutional monarchy abolished, but under the 1982 Constitution Act, severing ties with the monarchy would require Canada obtain the approval from the commons and the senate, as well as the unanimous consent of all 10 provinces.View image in fullscreenThe king and members of the Royal Commonwealth Society lay soil on a red maple in the grounds of Buckingham Palace.Photograph: Aaron Chown/PAThelast task is near impossible:provinces would fear that changes to the constitution could mean surrendering powers to the federal government.That has not quieted a growing chorus of critical voices.Before Charles’s coronation, the leader of the separatist Bloc Québécois said it wastime for Canada to sever its tieswith “incredibly racist” and “slave-driven” British monarchy.“It’s a thing of the past. It’s almost archaeological. It’s humiliating,” Yves-François Blanchet told lawmakers in 2022 during a speech in parliament, adding his party had been “forced” to swear allegiance to a “conquering” empire, rendering their oaths to the crown “meaningless”.Late last year, municipal councillors in the Yukon territoryrefused to swear or affirmthey would “be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles III” and his “heirs and successors according to law” as protest over the colonial history of displacement of Indigenous people.But Perry Bellegarde, the former national chief for the Assembly of First Nations, said such frustrations reflect a failure of the crown to implement the terms of treaties signed between Indigenous peoples and Great Britain centuries ago.“The crown never passed a treaty implementation act. Instead, they passed the Indian Act to control our people. But just because the crown has done immense harm, it doesn’t mean you forget about the treaty,” he said. “Our elders always said, ‘As long as the sun shines, rivers flow and the grass grows, the treaty will remain in effect for children and generations now and those yet unborn.’ That’s the covenant. It cannot ever be forgotten or displaced or broken.”In 2001, Bellegarde and the late elder Gordon Oakes gave Charles, then Prince of Wales, the Cree name kīsikāwipīsimwa miyo ōhcikanawāpamik, meaning “the sun watches over him in a good way”. Bellegarde met Charles last week at Canada House in London ahead of the visit.Indigenous leaders will meet the king when he arrives and ahead of his speech from the throne, a young Métis musician will perform and an Inuk elder will light thequlliq, a ceremonial fire.“These are powerful symbols. But it’s also recognition of the power Indigenous peoples have to self-determination as defined by the constitution,” said Bellegarde.“To have the king visit, to have our treaty partner travel here to meet with us, it reflects the foundations of this country. And it’s also a reminder for everyone:the honour of the crownin these agreements must also always be upheld.”This article was amended on 26 May 2025. The speech that Queen Elizabeth gave in 1977 to lawmakers was part of her silver jubilee tour of Canada, not diamond jubilee as an earlier version said. And the Indian Act was mistakenly referred to as the “Indiana Act”. And 1957 was the year in which a monarch opened a new session of parliament for the first time, not the last time.Explore more on these topicsCanadaKing Charles IIIMonarchyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

His wife’s hand appears to shove him, causing him to step back before recovering and waving.Brigitte Macron’s body is not visible and her husband told reporters afterwards the gesture was playful. But the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, seized on the footage, writing on Telegram that the president had received “a right hook”.“Did the first lady decide to cheer up her husband with a gentle pat on the cheek and miscalculated her strength?” she asked in a mocking post. “Did she want to fix his collar but ended up reaching the beloved face?” Zakharova added, after the Russia Today TV channel and associated social media accounts had repeatedly aired the clip. “Here’s a hint: maybe it was the ‘hand of the Kremlin’.”Macron told reporters in Hanoi he and his wife were “joking around, as we do quite often”. An Élysée Palace official told French media the scene showed “a moment of closeness. But that was enough to feed the conspiracy theorists.”Another Elysée sourcesaid the couplewere “decompressing one last time before the start of the visit, larking around”. Macron “loves playing jokes like on his wife before official occasions, and she always responds like this … It wasn’t even a slap.”View image in fullscreenThe Macrons take part in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum in Hanoi on Monday.Photograph: Jeanne Accorsini/SIPA/ShutterstockMacron noted that other videos of him had been misinterpreted. People “have thought I shared a bag of cocaine, tussled with the Turkish president, now that I’m having a domestic dispute with my wife … None of this is true. Everyone needs to calm down,” he said.Zakharova and the US conspiracy theorist Alex Jonesthis month wrongly accusedMacron, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, of using drugs on a train to Kyiv, claiming a crumpled tissue was a bag of cocaine.Macron told reporters in Hanoi the internet accounts making the claims were “familiar”, allying Russians with French extremists, adding that commentators had “explained this morning that my diplomacy was that of a battered husband”.France andVietnamon Monday signed deals on Airbus planes, defence and other pacts worth €9bn (£7.55bn) as the Macrons embarked on the first formal visit by a French presidential couple to the country’s former colony in nearly a decade.The deals with Vietnam come amid trade turmoil prompted by Donald Trump’s US tariffs and cover the purchase of 20 Airbus planes, cooperation on nuclear energy, defence, rail and maritime transport, satellites and vaccines.Explore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronBrigitte MacronVietnamFranceEuropeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

In a new edition containing additional material that was published in 2021, Tatsuki said the next major disaster would occur on 5 July 2025. Her claim has fuelled sensationalist social media posts warning people to stay away from Japan.While there is no scientific basis to the claims that are fuelling online speculation, Tatsuki’s dreams have been given credence by her previous reference to March 2011, when anearthquake and tsunami killed more than 18,000 peoplein north-east Japan and triggered the triple meltdown atFukushimaDaiichi nuclear power plant.View image in fullscreenJapanese manga comic The Future I Saw.Photograph: The Future I SawThe impact of her latest prediction is being felt most in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, which used ForwardKeys data to gauge the impact on airline bookings. Average bookings from Hong Kong were down 50% year-on-year, it said, adding that those between late June and early July had plummeted by as much as 83%.A travel agency in Hong Kong said the manga had already affected people’s holiday plans, with bookings to Japan during the April-May spring break down by half from last year.Greater Bay Airlines said it was initially puzzled that reservations for spring were lower than in previous years, given that demand is usually high during the cherry blossom-viewing season in Japan and the Easter holidays in Hong Kong.“We expected around 80% of the seats to be taken, but actual reservations came to only 40%,” said Hiroki Ito, the general manager of the airline’s Japan office, told the Asahi Shimbun recently.The airline – along with Hong Kong Airlines – has reduced services to Japan, even as officials pleaded with travellers to ignore the rumours. Yoshihiro Murai, the governor of Miyagi – one of three prefectures hardest hit by the 2011 disaster – said the unfounded story had started to affect tourism to the region and implored people to ignore them.The trend is out of sync with atourism boomthat has seen record numbers of people visit Japan since the end of the Covid-19 pandemic. A record 3.9 million people visited in April, encouraged by a weaker yen, while the government is hoping the annual number will grow to 60 million by the end of the decade.The public broadcaster NHK said the manga had spawned more than 1,400 videos on YouTube – which have together been viewed more than 100m times – some of which added to the sense of alarm with predictions of a volcanic eruption and a meteor strike. The re-published version has sold almost 1m copies, it added.Japan is one of the mostearthquake-pronecountries in the world due to its location on the Pacific’s seismically hyperactive “ring of fire”. But experts point out it is impossible to predict the timing and location of earthquakes with any accuracy.Concern that the country could soon be struck by a major earthquake intensified last August, when the then prime minister, Fumio Kishida,cancelled an overseas tripafter seismologists warned that the risk of a “megaquake” occurring off the country’s Pacific coast had increased after an earlier quake.In April, a government taskforce said a quake of up to magnitude-9 in the Nankai Trough, located off Japan’s Pacific coast, would kill as many 298,000 people and destroy more than 2 million buildings, adding that there was a roughly 80% chance of such a quake happening in the next 30 years.Tatsuki, meanwhile, has warned people not to take her predictions literally. In a recent interview with the Mainichi Shimbun, the artist said she was pleased that her work had raised awareness of the need to prepare for natural disasters, but added: “It’s important not to be unnecessarily influenced … and to listen to the opinions of experts.”Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificManganewsShareReuse this content"

We are not going to sit around and read poetry to rare lizards, whilst our current account deficit goes down the gurgler,” Jones said.The government’s mining plan represents jobs and economic stability to some but has been met with strong opposition from others, who believe it will endanger New Zealand’s unique environment and species. Due to its isolation, New Zealand has high rates of endemic biodiversity, however some species are in worrying decline, witha high proportion threatened, or at risk of extinction.View image in fullscreenNZ First MP Shane Jones.Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/Getty ImagesThe mining strategy includes adding coal and gold to the “critical minerals list” – a selection of minerals considered essential to New Zealand’s economy, national security or technological needs. Elevenmining proposals to dig up coal, gold and mineral sands are being considered under the new fast-track process – acontroversial “one-stop shop”consenting regime for infrastructure and mining projects deemed nationally significant. The government says the process will include a description of the project’s impacts on the environment, which the decision-making panel must consider.But the scheme passed into law in 2024 amid anger it bypasses environmental regulations, shuts out public consultation and throws a lifeline to so-called ‘zombie’ projects that have been rejected in the courts and languishing for years, including a proposal tomine iron sands off Taranaki’s seabedrejected by the supreme court.Other controversial projects include a goldmine near the Coromandel under conservation land, which is home to the rare Archey’s frog, and two mines on the South Island’s West Coast: a goldmine critics fear willthreaten rare birds, and a coalmine onecologically significant land.The fast-track legislation promptedthousands to march in protestin 2024 and nearly 30,000 public submissions on the bill. This year, targeted protests have been springing up around some of the proposed mining sites.Nicola Toki, the chief executive of Forest & Bird, the country’s largest conservation organisation says the government has “declared a war on nature” and adds the mining push does not square with the way New Zealand sees itself.“When governments push on the things that define us, the New Zealand public does push back,” Toki says.But Jones told the Guardian his opponents’ distrust of miners and fears for the environment are misplaced and regulation should not be so disproportionate that companies abort their project. The minister claimed the “secular state has become victim to religiosity” over the environment.“People no longer go to church, but they treat snails and other critters in a way that historically would [not] have enjoyed religious veneration,” Jones tells the Guardian. “I’m not going to agree with that.”The country could no longer afford to maintain “that level of naivety in the face of major geopolitical changes”, he said, adding that it made no sense to import coal, when it could be produced in New Zealand.“It generates GST, it generates pay, it generates jobs, it generates corporate tax, but more importantly, it deepens the well of human capital,” Jones said. Further, the minister said he will campaign to “overcome the regulations obstructing mining activity on [conservation land]” ahead of the 2026 election.View image in fullscreenA proposal to mine the seabed at Pātea Beach, South Taranaki, has drawn opposition from some in the community.Photograph: Eva Corlett/The GuardianGlenn Banks, a professor in geography at Massey University, is less optimistic about the financial gains to be made from mining in New Zealand, saying volatility in the industry makes it hard to regulate – and rely on – foreign investment.“You get a lot of cowboys jump in on the boom and then walk away when prices aren’t good.”The inclusion of coal and gold on the critical minerals list is also “out of step with international definitions” Banks said. Critical minerals overseas are largely those considered to be instrumental for the development of renewable energy. Neither coal or gold fit that bill, he said.Labour’s spokesperson for resources, Megan Woods, said public scrutiny and careful assessment of environmental risks are essential to gaining the social licence for mining, but this government was “throwing those out” with the fast-track process.“I think that is to the detriment of New Zealand.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandMiningAsia PacificBiodiversitynewsShareReuse this content"

Adelaide’s tallest building is 138m, although there are also plans under way for a 183m building.Walker Tower 2 will span almost 50,000 square metres, accommodate up to 5,000 office workers and 100 retail workers, and will include a rooftop bar and restaurant. The Walker Corporation has already built a tower in the Festival Plaza precinct.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBut Adelaide resident Robert Farnan, who has convened a working party composed of planners, architects, lawyers, residents’ groups, the Greens and others to raise awareness of the issues and lobby state and federal governments to intervene, said it was a “hugely questionable” development and a “state-supported skyscraper on public land”.“The word is spreading about the significance of the site [as] the place where full democracy first occurred,” he said.Adelaide becomes fifth Australian capital where median house value exceeds $1mRead moreIn 1894, the parliament passed world-first laws allowing women to both vote and stand for election. Aboriginal women were also enfranchised – although they facedmultiple barriers.Both old and new parliament houses are on the national heritage list because of “a series of radical reforms to political laws and processes that Australians now take for granted”.“It was here that the democratic ideals of all men and women having the right to vote, secret ballots, and one person/one vote were first introduced,”its listing reads.Stewart Sweeney, a retired academic and public policy advocate who worked with SA’s famously reformist premier Don Dunstan, described the proposal as a “phallic logo-ridden tower of exclusion”.“It’s the wrong building in the wrong place,” he said. “It’s next to the parliament, but that’s not just any old parliament, it’s a special parliament in a global sense.“It’s the parliament where the breakthrough on women’s suffrage, for the right to vote and to stand for parliament was first legislated, and it’s hard to think of a place where erecting a tower whose main claim to fame is the highest tower in Adelaide is the right place to do that.”Loine Sweeney, wife of Stewart and former executive officer of the Women’s Suffrage Centenary, said the tower would be a “profound mistake” that would not just overshadow a building but a legacy.Adelaide City Council is opposed to the development because of its impact on Parliament House and because the site is part of theAdelaide Parklands. The Adelaide Park Lands Association called it a “monster”, a private high-rise development that undermined what the parklands represent – being “free, green, and public”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

InSwedenandEnglandrates of use are over 30%.IUDs are small devices implanted in the uterus. As a form of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), they are themost effectiveway to prevent pregnancy (over 99%).Contraceptive pills also have a rate of efficacy above 99% if taken correctly. But its effectiveness can be reduced if taken irregularly or absorption can be affected by diarrhoea and vomiting.When the survey tested women’s knowledge on which methods were best at preventing pregnancy, the most common answer (32%) incorrectly identified condoms, while 27% said all are equally effective. Just one in four women (27%) correctly identified IUDs.Conducted online in mid-2024, the survey found three in 10 women aged 25 to 44 and 8% of women aged 18 to 24 said they’d had an unplanned pregnancy.White said “most women are not aware that these long-acting, reversible contraceptives are actually the most effective form of contraception at a time when so many of them are saying it’s really important for them not to become pregnant”.“They’re walking past one of the best options they’ve got because they just don’t know about it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

IUDs had other benefits, she said, including their convenience in not interrupting sex, easing period pain and being more cost effective over the long term than other forms of contraception.The leader of the Sphere Centre of Research Excellence in women’s sexual and reproductive health in primary care, Prof Danielle Mazza, said not enough healthcare providers in Australia are trained in the insertion of IUDs, and may be less likely to emphasise the benefits. Sphere conducted the survey in collaboration with Jean Hailes.In its most recent budget, as part of thehalf a billion dollar package for women’s health, the federal government increased payments to doctors and nurse practitioners to insert and remove IUDs. Eight centres will be set up to train healthcare professionals.White said access issues in rural and regional Australia might be alleviated if more women were considered using IUDs.IUD insertions by a private provider has higher upfront costs, White said, but that cost is “well and truly recouped” compared with buying the pill or condoms over the long term.Women with endometriosis more likely to experience early menopause, study findsRead moreAs several states have moved towardspharmacy prescribing the contraceptive pill, Mazza said it is important women are still being advised about all their contraceptive options, including LARCs, even though pharmacists can’t provide them.White said some women are also concerned about the pain of insertion, in part fuelled by social media amplifying negative experiences. “But in fact, there’s a lot of people who really swear by having IUDs and love how convenient they are.”The chair of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists’ sexual reproductive health committee, Prof Kirsten Black, said in her experience patients will often say “that’s not nearly as bad as they thought” after the procedure.Black said it was surprising knowledge was so low in the survey, but added “we have a real failure of public education in this area”, unlike in northern Europe.Black said she hopes the government incentives will improve the skills of primary care practitioners to provide IUDs.Explore more on these topicsHealthWomen's healthContraception and family planningnewsShareReuse this content"

The defendants can appeal against the rulings.The scandal began in September 2015 when the US Environmental Protection Agency issued a notice of violation saying Volkswagen had rigged engine control software that enabled diesel cars to pass emissions tests while emitting far more pollution in actual driving.The company has paid more than $33bn (£24bn) in fines and compensation to vehicle owners. Two VW managersreceived prison sentences in the US. The former head of the company’s Audi division Rupert Stadler was given a suspended sentence of 21 months and a fine of €1.1m (£920,000); his sentence is still subject to appeal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It can now do that.”In response, the Kremlin described the decision as “dangerous”, saying it would be detrimental to reaching any sort of peace agreement. “If these decisions have indeed been made, they are completely at odds with our aspirations for a political settlement,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.Merz, who has been in power for just under three weeks, would, however, not be drawn on whetherGermanywas preparing to send its long-range Taurus missiles to Kyiv. In opposition he had advocated for giving the missiles to Ukraine, which his predecessor, Olaf Scholz, had refused to do.Since entering office, Merz has taken a more cautious approach, saying Germany was in danger of giving too much away to Moscow if it talked openly about its plans, and arguing that Putin, a fluent German speaker, should not be able to find out what Berlin’s intentions were simply by watching the German TV news. Merz said last week he preferred the approach of “strategic ambiguity”.However, there is speculation in Berlin that he may be on the verge of making a public statement committing to the delivery of longer-range weaponry, possibly Taurus.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is to visit the German capital on Wednesday, it was announced on Monday morning.Merz justified the change in policy of Germany and its allies, saying only by lifting the range restrictions was Ukraine in a position to be able to defend itself.“We call it in the jargon ‘long-range fire, which is to say to equip Ukraine with weapons with which it can strike at military goals beyond its borders,” Merz said, speaking at the Europaforum conference of the broadcaster WDR. He called this the “decisive difference between the military leadership of the aggressor Russia and Ukraine: whilst the latter has military goals in its sights, Russia is targeting civilians.”Western leaders have previously been pronounced in their insistence that to increase the weapons’ range was too provocative and in danger of escalating the conflict with the nuclear power, which has said the use of long-range weapons would be interpreted as the direct involvement in the war of the country that provided them.In his discussion with WDR, Merz was particularly acerbic in his criticism of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, saying his dismissive approach to engaging in talks that might lead to an end in fighting revealed his intention to prolong the war. “Putin obviously sees offers of talks as a sign of weakness,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ukraine’s supporters had “done everything” they could, he said, short of “raising a white flag”.“If even an offer to meet at the Vatican does not get [Putin’s] approval, then we must be prepared for this war to last longer than we all wish or can imagine,” he added.Until now, Germany, the second biggest deliverer of weapons to Ukraine after the US, had not delivered any weapons to Ukraine that had a range beyond 70km (43 miles).During the election campaign leading up to the 23 February poll, Merz said he was prepared to consider delivering Taurus missiles when in office, but only in conjunction with Germany’s western allies, which had either already delivered similar weapons or had access to them and were intending to do so.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Von der Leyen initiated the call, the EU spokesperson said, adding “there was, it seems, a mutual intention to speak to each other”.The EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, is due to speak to the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, later on Monday. Thepair last spoke on Friday, after Trump’s latest tariff threat.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Monday he hoped Washington and Brussels could get to the lowest tariffs possible. “The discussions are advancing,” he told reporters during a trip to Vietnam.“There has been a good exchange between President Trump and President Von der Leyen and I hope we can continue on this road and return to the lowest possible tariffs that will allow for fruitful exchanges.”Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who is deemed to have one of the closest relationships with the White House among EU leaders, was reported by local media to be trying to organise a meeting between Trump and European leaders in early June.Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Harris, said there was “no time to waste” to find a deal that was good for the US and EU economies. “These contacts at the highest political level present the opportunity for negotiations to move forward. This is our priority. We want to see meaningful and substantive talks,” he said.Speaking on Monday, the commission confirmed thatthe EU’s “zero-for-zero” offerto eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods in transatlantic trade remained on the table. “We believe that is a very attractive starting point for a good negotiation that could lead to benefits on both sides of the Atlantic,” the trade spokesperson Olof Gill said.The commission declined to comment on the detailed talks between Trump and von der Leyen.The commission president hada brief exchange with Trumpat the pope’s funeral last month, her first since his return to the White House. Analysts have suggested the US president, who has repeatedly voiced hostility towards the EU and multilateral institutions, prefers to deal with national leaders.Trump initially announced a 20% levy on EU goods being sold into the US as part of his “liberation day” tariffs unveiled on 2 April, but a week later he reduced that to 10% to allow for time for talks. However on Friday, he claimed negotiations were “going nowhere”, upped the rate to 50% and brought the deadline forward to 1 June.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

US markets were closed for a public holiday on Monday, but futures rose on the U-turn news.The flip-flopping on border taxes has left many businesses unsure of what plans to make, with many withdrawing their financial forecasts in response.Trump’s 25% tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars remain in place. Šefčovič held a video conference on Monday with the chief executives of the carmakers Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, BMW and Stellantis to reassure them.The EU hassuspended its retaliatory tariffs on €21bn(£18bn) of US agricultural and industrial goods in Republican states, but they will kick in on 14 July without a deal. The European Commission is also consulting member states and European industry on a further round of retaliatory tariffs targeting €95bn (£80bn) of US goods, including bourbon, cars and industrial machinery.The commission has previously said it has not ruled out targeting US tech firms or banks, a potent but politically explosive target, as the US runs a €109bn (£91bn) trade surplus with the EU in service industries. Trump is more focused on the US trade deficit in goods, worth €198bn (£166bn) in 2024.Speaking before Trump’s latest round of on-off tariff threats, a senior EU diplomat said all options for retaliation were on the table, but stressed the wish for a settlement: “At the moment we still want to be de-escalatory and in a negotiating mood.”Explore more on these topicsTariffsEuropean UnionTrump tariffsDonald TrumpInternational tradeGlobal economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It did not look like something that had been used as a hammer or an anvil; it didn’t look like a tool at all.“The stone was oddly shaped and had a red ochre dot, which really caught our eye,” said David Álvarez Alonso, an archaeologist at Complutense University in Madrid.“We were all thinking the same thing and looking at each other because of its shape: we were all thinking, ‘This looks like a face’. But obviously that wasn’t enough. As we carried on our research, we knew we needed information to be able to advance the hypothesis that there was some purposefulness here, this was a symbolic object and that one possible explanation – although we’ll never know for sure – is that this was the symbolisation of a face.”The findings reinforce the idea that Neanderthals were capable of artistic and symbolic creation.Photograph: Álvarez-Alonso et alDetermined to test their conviction that the red mark was a human fingerprint placed deliberately between the indentations that could have been the eyes and mouth of a face, the team enlisted the help of other experts. Further investigations confirmed that the pigment, which contained iron oxides and clay minerals, was not found elsewhere in or around the cave.“We then got in touch with the scientific police to determine whether we were right that the dot had been applied using a fingertip,” said Álvarez Alonso. “They confirmed that it had.” The print, they concluded, was human and could be that of an adult male.“Once we had that and all the other pieces, context and information, we advanced the theory that this could be apareidolia[catching sight of a face in an ordinary, inanimate object] which then led to a human intervention in the form of the red dot,” said the archaeologist. “Without that red dot, you can’t make any claims about the object.”Álvarez Alonso argues that the dot’s existence raises questions that all point in the same direction.“It couldn’t have been a coincidence that the dot is where it is – and there are no markings to indicate any other use,” he said. “So why did they bring this pebble from the river to the inside of the cave? And, what’s more, there’s no ochre inside the cave or outside it. So they must have had to bring pigment from elsewhere.”The team’s findings, reported in the journalArchaeological and Anthropological Sciences, reinforce the idea that Neanderthals – who died out some 40,000 years ago –were capable of acts of artistic and symbolic creation, meaning modern humans were not the first to use art as a means of expression.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These are the basic elements characterising symbolism and, also prehistoric – non-figurative – art. Furthermore, this pebble could thus represent one of the oldest known abstractions of a human face in the prehistoric record.”Álvarez Alonso and his colleagues are looking forward to the debate that their discovery will reignite over whether modern humans were the first artists.“We’ve set out our interpretation in the article, but the debate goes on,” he said. “And anything to do with Neanderthals always prompts a massive debate. If we had a pebble with a red dot on it that was done 5,000 years ago by Homo sapiens, no one would hesitate to call it portable art. But associating Neanderthals with art generates a lot of debate. I think there’s sometimes an unintentional prejudice.”Still, said the archaeologist, he and the rest of the team believed the most logical explanation was that someone, a very long time ago, “saw something special in this pebble”, picked it up and set about imbuing it with meaning.“Why would a Neanderthal have seen it differently from the way we see it today?” he asked. “They were human, too. The thing here is that we’re dealing with an unparalleled object; there’s nothing similar. It’s not like art where, if you discover a cave painting, there are hundreds more you can use for context. But our assertion is that the Neanderthals had a similar capacity for symbolic thought to Homo sapiens – and we think this object reinforces that notion.”Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyNeanderthalsAnthropologySpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But they urge him to act without delay as “urgent and decisive action is required to avert the destruction of the Palestinian people of Gaza”.The signatories, including the former supreme court justices Lord Sumption and Lord Wilson, court of appeal judges and more than 70 KCs, say that war crimes, crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law are being committed in Palestine.There is mounting evidence of genocide, which is either being perpetrated or at a minimum at serious risk of occurring, the letter states, highlighting recent comments by the Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who said Israel’s armywould “wipe out”what remains of Palestinian Gaza.The signatories tell Starmer: “All states, including the UK, are legally obliged to take all reasonable steps within their power to prevent and punish genocide; to ensure respect for international humanitarian law; and to bring to an end violations of [the right to self-determination]. The UK’s actions to date have failed to meet those standards … The international community’s failure to uphold international law in relation to the occupied Palestinian territory contributes to a deteriorating international climate of lawlessness and impunity and imperils the international legal system itself. Your government must act now, before it is too late.”The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, last week announcedthe suspension of negotiationsover a new free trade deal with Israel, but the two-page letter, backed by a 35-page legal memorandum, says he must go further, faster by reviewing existing trade ties, suspending the 2030 roadmap for closer UK-Israel partnership and imposing trade sanctions.The legal experts call on him to immediately sanction Israeli ministers or senior officials in the Israel Defense Forces who they accuse of having incited genocide or supporting and sponsoring illegal settlements. They note that so far financial sanctions and travel bans have beenlimited to individual settlers, settler outposts and settler organisations.The Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, has previously said: “The charge of genocide levelled against Israel is not only false, it’s outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it.”The letter, also signed by the former court of appeal judges Sir Stephen Sedley, Sir Anthony Hooper and Sir Alan Moses, a former chair of the bar of England and Wales (Matthias Kelly KC) and of the bar of Northern Ireland (Brian Fee KC), says Israel has been responsible for “an unparalleled assault on the United Nations”.It points to Israel’s banning of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, which it calls the “backbone of aid” for the Palestinian people, from operating in the occupied territory and “attacks on UN premises, property and personnel”. These acts are said to “go beyond isolated breaches. They amount to a broader challenge to the UN charter system itself.”Accordingly, as a permanent member on the UN security council, the signatories say the UK should consider initiating proceedings that provide for suspension of a member state.Moses said: “We, in the UK, cannot expect peace unless we fulfil our obligations under international law. That is what upholding the rule of law means. It is an exercise in futility for a government to say it upholds the rule of law, if it then does nothing to demonstrate it.”Prof Guy Goodwin-Gill, a signatory and emeritus fellow of All Souls College, University of Oxford, said: “Now is the time for the UK to show its commitment to the rule of law and to a future in which Palestinians can freely fulfil their right to self-determination. Everyone must be free from persecution, from displacement and ethnic cleansing, from the devastation and death deliberately inflicted on them in their homes, schools and hospitals, in their farms and villages. No one should ever be a refugee in their own land.”Lammy’s strongest intervention on Israel to date came amid anger at Israel’s refusal to allow thousands of aid trucks access tostarving Palestinians. While an 11-week blockade has officially been lifted, the letter says that the limited aid allowed in “remains gravely insufficient to address the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe”.More than53,000 Palestinians have been killedby the Israeli offensive in Gaza since 7 October 2023 when a Hamas attack on southern Israel killed 1,200 people. An Israeli strike early on Monday on a school turned shelter, while people inside were sleeping, killed 36, according to health officials.1:19Dozens killed after Israeli attack on school used as shelter in Gaza – video reportAlso on Monday, one of Israel’s staunchest allies, Germany, added to international condemnation, with the chancellor,Friedrich Merz, saying the harm inflicted on civilians “can no longer be justified as a fight against Hamas terrorism”.In order to meet its legal obligations, the UK is also urged in the letter to secure an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the resumption of aid and the lifting of Israel’s ban on Unrwa. Finally, it says the UK should confirm that it would executethe international criminal court’s arrest warrantsagainst the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant.The letter increases the pressure on Starmer to act in the same week that the attorney general, Lord Hermer KC, is due to deliver the Rusi thinktank’s annual security lecture on “the condition of the international-rules-based-order”.Many Labour and Tory backbenchers have already said that the suspension of talks on the free trade deal does not go nearly far enough.Aprevious letterfrom members of the UK legal community sent last year said the UK was breaching international law by continuing to arm Israel. Weapons sales are not addressed in the latest missive because the issue isawaiting judgment by the high court in Londonafter a legal challenge.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesFriedrich MerzDavid LammyMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli takeover is not recognised internationally.The Jerusalem municipality advertises the event, known as the flag march, as a “festive procession”, part of a broader programme of events celebrating the “liberation” of the city.The march has been marred by racism and attacks on Palestinians for years, and is preceded by a campaign of violence in the Old City that in effect shuts down Palestinian majority areas, particularly in the Muslim Quarter.From before midday on Monday small groups of young Israeli men attacked and harassed shopkeepers and passersby inside the city, spitting at women in hijabs, stealing from cafes, ransacking a bookshop and entering at least one home by force.“Shut now, or I can’t protect you,” a police officer told cafe owner Raymond Himo, when he protested about teenagers in religious Zionist dress stealing drinks. On Monday, shops had mostly closed by 1pm, hours earlier than in previous years, with residents barricaded in their homes.Aviv Tatarsky, a researcher with the Ir Amim non-profit that works for an equitable Jerusalem, said: “It deprives people of their economic livelihood, makes them feel unsafe in their surroundings. Symbolically it sends a message: ‘You don’t belong here, we are the ones who own this place.’”From midday, groups of Jewish men inside the city shouted racist chants including “may their villages burn”, “Mohammed is dead” and “death to Arabs”.Those slogans were picked by larger groups of mostly men that began arriving in the late afternoon. Women approached the Western Wall on a separate march, which is largely divided by gender for religious reasons.One large group arriving at the Damascus Gate chanted “Gaza is ours”, and carried a large banner reading “Jerusalem 1967,Gaza2025”, in effect threatening full military annexation of the strip to echo the capture of East Jerusalem.Another banner read a “without a Nakba there is no victory”, referring to the forcible expulsion of about 700,000 Palestinians when the state of Israel was created in 1948.The procession is coordinated by “Am K’Lavi”, a non-profit whose only activity is organising the flag day march. It is chaired by Baruch Kahane, the son of Meir Kahane, a Jewish supremacist Rabbi who founded the Kach party. Banned as a political party in Israel in the 1980s under anti-terror legislation, it is now a far-right movement.Some marchers wore T-shirts with the party’s symbol of a clenched fist in a star of David. Others wore shirts with the names of their high schools, which had organised group outings to the march.View image in fullscreenThe Israeli far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was among the crowds in the Old City of Jerusalem.Photograph: Atef Safadi/EPADespite the history of violence at the march there was a relatively light police presence inside the Old City, and they did little to protect many of the Palestinians targeted with violence.Activists from the group Standing Together, who stood as human shields in front of attackers protected only by purple gilets identifying them as members were often the only barrier preventing the violence escalating.The far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir was among the crowds arriving at the Old City around sunset. He had earlier made an inflammatory trip to pray at al-Aqsa mosque in its compound, where officially Israel does not permit Jewish believers to carry out religious rituals.The prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, hosted a cabinet meeting in Silwan, in occupied East Jerusalem. He ignored warnings from the Shin Bet security service that it would be an inflammatory move, Israeli media reported.The flag march is already seen as a violent and deeply provocative expression of Jewish control of Jerusalem, which has in the past triggered broader conflict. Violence at the same eventhelped spark the 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in 2021.Danny Seidemann, an Israeli attorney specialising in the geopolitics of Jerusalem, described Netanyahu’s cabinet meeting as political “pyromania”.“The ridge to the south of the ramparts of the Old City, literally in the shadow of the Old City, is indeed the location of biblical Jerusalem. But it is also a contemporary Palestinian neighbourhood,” Seidemann said.“The past is being weaponised by biblically motivated settlers to displace Palestinians, demolish their homes and recreate their vision of a renewed pseudo-ancient Israel. This is the site, the most contested and volatile in Jerusalem, is where Netanyahu has decided to ‘celebrate’.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuGazaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Last week, the Office for National Statistics reporteda larger than expected jump in annual inflation to 3.5% in April. The increase, to the highest rate in more than a year, followed dramatic increases in water bills, energy costs and council tax.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The rare dose of good news, and a further expected reduction expected when Ofgem reassesses the cap again in September, has led some analysts to say this trend should limit the rise in inflation this year.The Bank of England forecast earlier this month that inflation would peak at an average 3.5% over the summer months.Explore more on these topicsInflationRetail industryFood & drink industryEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The latter two countries were the first on Trump’s tariff hitlist when heannounced tariffs of 25% on 1 February.Canadians in particular were incensed at Trump’s repeated suggestions that its northern neighbour would bebetter off annexed as the 51st state of the US.According to Trivago’s findings, which were shared with PA Media, demand among Germans was also “down heavily”, with hotel bookings in the US showing a single-digit percentage decline.Germany is the largest economy in the EU, which Trump has repeatedly threatened with increased tariffs, most recently saying on Sunday he had“paused” a 50% taxhe intended to introduce next month.There has not been a significant change in the numbers of UK holidaymakers travelling to the US. The UK has so far faced some of the lightest tariffs globally and last month struck a“breakthrough” trade deal with the US.Businesses operating in its $2.6tn tourism industry are becoming increasingly concerned about a“Trump slump”due to the turmoil the president’s tariff war is causing on the global economy.Last month, the federal government’s National Travel and Tourism Office released preliminary figures showingvisits to the US from overseas fell by 11.6% in Marchcompared with the same month last year.Bookings made via Expedia-owned Trivago also show that Americans are spending less on their trips, while there is higher demand for cheaper hotels and lower star categories.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In addition, 20 patients were treated at the scene near Water Street. Four children were injured in total.ACC Jenny Sims, with Merseyside police, said the incident is not being treated as terrorism and they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.The prime minister said the scenes were “appalling”, while Liverpool FC offered its “thoughts and prayers” to those affected by the incident.Footage showed police cordons in place around the heavily littered road, with a large police presence, ambulances and a fire engine also at the scene.Map of Liverpool.Upsetting images captured a person being taken away on a stretcher and a man walking with his arm around a police officer for support.It is understood that approximately 30 people were treated for injuries or shock in an Italian restaurant opposite Liverpool town hall, around the corner from the scene of the collision.Les Winsper, 55, who witnessed the incident, said: “People started banging on the [car] windows. Then they smashed the windows and he’s panicked and put his foot down. He then hit someone and that person has gone in the air and he’s ploughed through the rest of them. I’ve never seen anything like it.”He added the first victim was thrown “about 20 feet” in the air by the collision.Winsper’s friend, Craig Steward, 52, said there was “chaos” with “people crying, children crying, shaking”.He added: “I personally think he’s hit someone by mistake and then he’s put his foot down. It was the worst thing I’ve seen in my life, you see it on TV. That’s why all the kids are crying, because they witnessed it. I’m traumatised.”Both men said the incident lasted 20 to 30 seconds.St John ambulance workers were among the first at Water Street to treat those injured, some of whom are believed to be in a critical condition. A reporter at the scene saw two “distressed” volunteer medics being comforted by colleagues as they made their way from the scene.Outside the police cordon, Sonny Singh, 40, said he saw an injured teenager and dozens of people run past him “crying and angry” shortly after the collision.“People were running, screaming … I saw a boy, probably about 15, holding his leg and bleeding. There were loads of people there,” he said, adding that he had heard the vehicle hit dozens of fans.Singh, from Leicester, had been celebrating with his two sons, aged nine and 13.View image in fullscreenPolice and emergency personnel on Water Street, Liverpool on Monday 26 May.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAMatt Cole, a BBC reporter who attended the parade with his family, witnessed the incident. He told BBC News: “There were screams ahead of us and suddenly this dark blue car just came through the crowd. It just wasn’t stopping. I managed to grab my daughter who was with me and jump out of the way.“It missed myself and my family by literally inches. We then turned and watched what happened momentarily behind us before running.“It was being chased by a group of men who were trying to bang on the side of it and throw things at it. The back of the rear windshield had been completely smashed in, but it just had no intention of stopping.”He added: “An entire squad of armed police cars stopped, and people jumped out with rifles and again big medical packs on and began running to the scene of the incident.”One eyewitness said the vehicle reversed before “what seemed like an incredibly deliberate” acceleration into a crowd of people on Water Street.View image in fullscreenPolice on the scene after the incident.Photograph: UNPIXS/BBCHarry Rashid, 48, from Solihull, was at the parade with his wife and two young daughters when he witnessed the collision. “It happened about 10 feet away from us … The vehicle came to our right. It emerged from just right next to an ambulance, which was parked up. This grey people carrier just pulled up from the right and just rammed into all the people at the side of us.“It was travelling south, down Water Street, straight towards the Strand, which is where the docks are. It was extremely fast. Initially, we just heard the pop, pop, pop of people just being knocked off the bonnet of a car.Rashid described how crowds began trying to smash the car windows: “Then he stalled for a few seconds, probably about 10 seconds. Then the crowd that was a bit further back started rushing at him trying to smash his windows.“But then he put his foot down again and just ploughed through the rest of them, he just kept going. It was horrible. And you could hear the bumps as he was going over the people. Then my daughter started screaming and there were people on the ground.“It looked clearly deliberate.”View image in fullscreenPolice cordons have been put in place around the heavily littered road, with emergency service vehicles attending.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersRashid continued: “They were just innocent people, just fans going to enjoy the parade. There were hundreds and thousands of us there because this is probably the busiest part of Liverpool. We were shocked, couldn’t believe it.”Emergency services arrived at the scene “within seconds”, he said. “Ambulances were already there. There was one right next to where this occurred, so there was a paramedic inside there.“But then they started arriving within seconds, they’re all trying to get to the crowd and negotiate the crowd, which is very difficult to do, you see, because there’s that many people, they’ve constantly been trying to move.“I just wanted my kids to get off the road regardless because I couldn’t trust whether there’s a follow-up attack or something like that. Because you are just exposed there on the pavement.“I saw people lying on the ground, people unconscious. It was horrendous. So horrendous.”Natasha Rinaldi, who was watching the parade from her friend’s living room, said: “People were very angry and shocked, and then the police intervened. And then we heard the ambulances coming.”North West ambulance service said the scene was cleared by about 9.30pm.View image in fullscreenThe collision came just after roads were reopened after the main parade had finished, the Guardian understands.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersKeir Starmer and the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, are being kept updated about events.Starmer said: “The scenes in Liverpool are appalling – my thoughts are with all those injured or affected. I want to thank the police and emergency services for their swift and ongoing response to this shocking incident.“I’m being kept updated on developments and ask that we give the police the space they need to investigate.”In a statement posted on social media, Liverpool FC said: “We are in direct contact with Merseyside police regarding the incident on Water Street which happened towards the end of the trophy parade earlier this evening.“Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by this serious incident.“We will continue to offer our full support to the emergency services and local authorities who are dealing with this incident.”Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool city region, said: “Our hearts go out to all of those affected, especially those who have been injured. Thank you, as ever, to the first responders for their professionalism and swift action.“This is a difficult day for our city region, but we stand together.”A spokesperson for the north west ambulance service said: “NWAS is supporting an incident in Liverpool city centre, following reports of a road traffic collision.“We are currently assessing the situation and working with other members of the emergency services. Our priority is to ensure people receive the medical help they need as quickly as possible.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This is a bigger issue than Falkner, but she isn’t a help.”In April, the EHRC releasedinterim, non-statutory adviceabout how to interpret the ruling, which set out that transgender people should not be allowed to use toilets of the gender they live as, and that in some cases they cannot use toilets of their birth sex.A number of critics have called the advice oversimplistic. One Labour MP said: “A lot of lawyers told me it is utterly ridiculous, and the supreme court judgment does not necessarily mean that.” Some government officials are also worried, with one saying the EHRC had “bungled” the advice.Falkner, a crossbench peer, is seen as having led closely on the interim advice. Some EHRC sources said most senior staff had no idea it had even been drawn up until it was published on the organisation’s website late on a Friday evening.The EHRC initially set a two-week timetable for consulting on the full guidance, but changedthat to six weeksafter concern fromthe Commons women’s and equalities committee.While Falkner and the EHRC will be responsible for drawing up the formal guidance, this must then be signed off by the government, and some believe it could end up not being in place before Falkner is replaced.Last November she was given a 12-month extension on her four-year term. Harriet Harman, the Labour former cabinet minister who introduced the 2010 Equality Act to parliament, has been named as a possible successor.While a number of MPs believe Harman could do a better job, such a long delay in setting out how organisations should respond to the supreme court would risk months of confusion for them, and significant worry for transgender people.“Most public bodies don’t know what to do,” another MP said. “The government is frozen and waiting to see what the EHRC says. But I don’t think we’ll get anywhere with Falkner as chair. She’s not neutral.“Unless ministers are confident that all voices are being heard they won’t sign off on the guidance, and they are watching this very closely. It’s currently a bit of a mess.”John Kirkpatrick, the EHRC’s chief executive, said the interim update was “issued in response to a high level of demand for accurate information following the judgment”, and that Falkner had been “visible in providing clarity on the consequences of the judgment on behalf of the EHRC”.He added: “Like all well-governed organisations, we have robust decision-making processes and internal channels through which colleagues can escalate concerns.

That valor gave us the freest, greatest and most noble republic ever to exist on the face of the earth,” he said of those killed in military service.Then he went on: “A republic that I am fixing after a long and hard four years. That was a hard four years we went through.”The president continued with ananti-immigrationstatement that chimes withhis agenda, though without directly mentioning his predecessor, Democratic president Joe Biden who served between Trump’s first term and the Republican’s return to the White Housethis January.“Who would let that happen? People pouring through our borders unchecked. People doing things that are indescribable and not for today to discuss,” Trump said.It was a nod to his Truth Social platform on Monday morning wherehe posteda tirade against judges who hold up his deportation aims, chiefly because of his ignoring due process obligations, as “monsters” and again attacked undocumented immigrants, using sweeping disparagements.At Arlington, he added, to cheers from supporters in the crowd: “We will do better than we’ve ever done as a nation, better than ever before. I promise you that.”Drawing attention to airmen lost in a raid over Vietnam and to a soldier lost to a suicide bombing in Iraq, while family members listened to the speech at the cemetery on the outskirts ofWashington DC, Trump said: “These warriors picked up the mantle of duty and service, knowing that to live for others meant always that they might die for others. They asked nothing. They gave everything. And we owe them everything and more.”“The greatest monument to their courage is not carved in marble or cast in bronze – it’s all around us, an American nation 325 million strong, which will soon be greater than it has ever been before,” he said. “It will be.”He also used the solemn occasion to promote the celebration next month of the US army’s 250th anniversary, which he said “blows everything away, including the World Cup and including the Olympics, as far as I’m concerned”.Both events – the soccer World Cup next year, and the next summer Olympics in 2028 – are set to be held in the US within the span of Trump’s second term.Trump said: “We have the World Cup and we have the Olympics. I have everything. Amazing, the way things work out. God did that – I believe that,” he remarked of the timing. He added that “in some ways I’m glad I missed that [consecutive] second term” because then he wouldn’t have been president for these milestones.He then returned to honoring fallen soldiers.Former Harvard president urges people to ‘speak out’ against threats to US democracyRead moreTrump also said on Monday he is considering taking a further $3bn of grant money away from Harvard University and giving it to trade schools across the US, while a former president of Harvard and current professor there, Drew Gilpin Faust,warned thatAmerican freedoms and democracy were at risk.At Arlington,Hegsethreferenced men who sacrificed their lives for the nation but made no reference to women. Hegseth has systematically and bluntlyattackedalldiversityefforts in the US military.Vance, however, noted that the national cemetery is the “eternal resting spot for our nation’s sons and daughters”.Trump has previously attracted heavy criticism for variousactions and remarksthat were disrespectful to fallen and wounded military veterans.Later on Monday afternoon, Trump pardoned former Virginia sheriff Scott Jenkins, who was convicted in December 2024 of conspiracy, fraud and bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS militaryUS politicsWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

His first stop in Edgartown after greeting cheering fans on the beach as he completed his feat was at an ice-cream shop, where he enjoyed a cone of salted caramel and berry brownie.Pugh said this was among his most difficult endurance swims in an almost 40-year career, which says a lot for someone who has swum near glaciers, including on Mount Everest, and volcanoes. He’s swum among hippos, crocodiles and polar bears. Pugh was the first athlete to swim across the north pole and complete a long-distance swim in every one of the world’s oceans.He said he expected the swim to be difficult because of the low water temperature, the distance and the fact that it was happening during the start of the shark migration season. But the weather proved the most challenging element of all.“It’s been a long journey, it really has, 12 days, cold water, constant wind, waves and then always thinking of what may be beneath me. It’s been a big swim. A very big swim,” he said. “When you swim for 12 days, you leave as one person and I think you come back as a different person with a new reflection on what you’ve been through.”Day after day, Pugh entered the island’s chilly waters wearing just trunks, a cap and goggles, enduring foul weather as a nor’easter storm dumped 7 in of cold, pounding rain on parts of New England and flooded the streets on Martha’s Vineyard, the famous and beautiful island off southern Massachusetts where some prominent politicians, including former US president Barack Obama,choose to relaxand the history of whale hunting is almost visceral.Some days, Pugh was only able to make it a little over half a mile before wind and waves made it impossible to see beyond an arm’s length in front of him. In some cases, he had to make up lost distance by swimming multiple legs in a day.“I was just getting really cold and swallowing a lot of sea water, not making headway and then you’re constantly thinking: ‘Are we taking the right route here? Should we go further out to sea? Should we get closer in?’” he said. “And meanwhile you’re fighting currents.”But Pugh, who has been named a United Nations patron of the oceans and often swims to raise awareness for environmental causes – said no swim is without risk, and that drastic measures are needed to get his message across: about 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day, a rate of nearly 100m every year, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.On Monday, Pugh called the decimation of sharks an “ecocide”. “I think protecting sharks is the most important part of the jigsaw puzzle of protecting the oceans,” he said.Jaws was released in the summer of 1975, based on the book, and setting new box office records.Both director Steven Spielberg and author Peter Benchley expressed regret that many viewers became so afraid of sharks. Both later contributed to conservation efforts.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsMassachusettsSharksJawsMarine lifeWildlifeAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

He died at a hospital inNew York, Stent said.A veteran of the Korean war, Rangel defeated legendary Harlem politician Adam Clayton Powell in 1970 to start his congressional career. During the next 40-plus years, he became a legend himself – dean of the New York congressional delegation, and, in 2007, the first African American to chair the powerfulHouseways and means committee.Democrat Charles Rangel convicted of financial misconduct by US CongressRead moreHe stepped down from that committee amid an ethics cloud, and the House censured him in 2010 after a House ethics committee conducted a hearing on 13 counts of alleged financial and fundraising misconduct over issues surrounding financial disclosures and use of congressional resources. He was convicted by Congress of 11 violations, but he continued to serve in the House until his retirement in 2017.Rangel was the last surviving member of the Gang of Four, Black political figures who wielded great power inNew YorkCity and state politics. The others were David Dinkins, New York City’s first Black mayor; Percy Sutton, who was Manhattan borough president; and Basil Paterson, a deputy mayor and secretary of state of New York.Rangel’s distinctive gravelly voice and wry sense of humor made him a memorable character not just in politics but in the rest of his life and environs.The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, paid tribute on X, calling Rangel a “great man, a great friend, and someone who never stopped fighting for his constituents and the best of America”.“The list of his accomplishments could take pages, but he leaves the world a much better place than he found it,” Schumer posted.The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, also praised Rangel.“Charlie Rangel was a phenomenal patriot, hero, statesman, leader, trailblazer, change agent and champion for justice,” he posted on X.Jeffries, a fellow New Yorker, called Rangel “the Lion of Lenox Ave”, an iconic street at the heart of Harlem, and said he was a transformational force of nature.“Harlem, NYC & America are better today because of his service. May he forever rest in power,” Jeffries posted.Rangel was known for fiercely looking out for his constituents, sponsoring empowerment zones with tax credits for businesses moving into economically depressed areas and developers of low-income housing.“I have always been committed to fighting for the little guy,” Rangel said in 2012.He was known as one of the most liberal representatives in the House, loudest in opposition to the Iraq war, which he branded a “death tax” on poor people and minorities. In 2004, he tried to end the war by offering a bill to restart the military service draft. Republicans called his bluff and brought the bill to a vote. Even Rangel voted against it.A year later, Rangel’s fight over the war became bitterly personal with the then US vice-president, Dick Cheney, Republican president George W Bush’s running mate and a prime defense hawk.Rangel said Cheney, who has a history of heart trouble, might be too sick to perform his job.“I would like to believe he’s sick rather than just mean and evil,” Rangel said. After several such verbal jabs, Cheney hit back, saying Rangel was “losing it”.The Harlem lawmaker first entered the House in 1971. In 1987, Congress approved what was known as the “Rangel amendment”, which denied foreign tax credits to US companies investing in apartheid-eraSouth Africa, where the wealthy ruling white minority held power by heavily oppressing the Black majority.Rangel was born on 11 June 1930. During the Korean war, he earned a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star.A high school dropout, he went to college on the GI Bill, getting degrees from New York University and St John’s University School of Law.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsHouse of RepresentativesNew YorkUS CongressUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We have been entrusted with their legacy. Can we trust ourselves to uphold it?” Faust wrote in a guest opinionessayfor the New York Times.She highlighted, in particular, the principles fought and died for by Union soldiers in the US civil war and the roles played by assassinated US president Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist and leading Black civil rights leader of the 19th century.“We must honor these men,” she wrote.Faust, who led Harvard between 2007 and 2018 and still teaches there, did not mention the US president by name but she referred to his position and made a direct link between the civil war and now.Noting that about 2.7 million men, mostly volunteers, in 1861-1865 “took up arms to preserve the Union as a beacon of democracy at a time when representative government seemed to be fading from the earth”, she went on to warn: “Today democracy is once again under worldwide threat, assailed as disorderly and inefficient by autocratic leaders from Budapest to Moscow to Beijing, leaders our own president openly admires.”View image in fullscreenDrew Gilpin Faust after being introduced as the 28th president of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 11 February 2007.Photograph: Adam Hunger / Reuters/REUTERSFaust said that Lincoln regarded the Confederacy’s split from the Union, when southern states seceded in order to defend slavery and evade federal government intervention, as a “direct assault” on government by the majority “held in restraint” by constitutional checks.“Those structured checks and the rule of law that embodies and enacts them are once again at risk as we confront the subservience of Congress, the defiance of judicial mandates and the arrogation of presidential power in a deluge of unlawful executive orders,” she wrote in her essay.Critics of Trump lament congressional Republicans’ acquiescence to the president’s expansions of his authority and challenges to constitutional constraints, Democrats’ lackluster resistance, and the administration’s defiance of court orders over various anti-immigration extremes and partisan firings of federal officials and watchdogs without cause.Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly accused Harvard of antisemitism and bias against Jewish students and attacked its efforts towards greater diversity on campus, and the administration has further demanded cooperation with federal immigration authorities, while harnessing federal powers to try to punish the university.Last Friday,Harvard suedprominent government departments and cabinet secretaries for what it said was a “blatant violation” of the US constitution when the Trump administration announced it would revoke federal permission for the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based institution to enroll international students.

Trump claimed he was “not looking for a deal”, repeating his longstanding view that European states had “banded together to take advantage of us”.German finance minister Lars Klingbeil on Sunday said he had spoken with his US counterpart Scott Bessent about the matter.“We don’t need any further provocations, but serious negotiations,” he told the Bild newspaper, adding “the US tariffs endanger the US economy just as much as the German and European economy”.If imposed, the increase would dramatically raise Washington’s current tariff baseline levy of 10% to 50%, and fuel simmering tensions between two of the world’s economic heavyweights. Trump had previously paused threatened tariff hikes for three months to allow time for negotiations, giving trading partners until July to agree to new terms.The latest threat of a June hike sent stock markets into a tailspin on Friday, amid fears of renewed global economic disruption, with the US dollar also falling in value.The EU is one of Washington’s largest trading partners, sending more than $600bn (£444bn) in goods last year and buying $370bn worth, according to US government figures.Klingbeil reiterated Germany’s support for the EU in handling the talks with the US. “We as Europeans are united and determined to represent our interests,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He later shared his password so the deepfake images could be removed.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailA spokesperson for the eSafety commissioner said the regulator was seeking between $400,000 and $450,000 for the breaches of the Online Safety Act.The spokesperson said the penalty submission reflected the seriousness of the breaches “and the significant impacts on the women targeted”.“The penalty will deter others from engaging in such harmful conduct,” they said.eSafety said the non-consensual creation and sharing of explicit deepfake images caused significant psychological and emotional distress for victims.The penalties hearing was held on Monday, and the court has reserved its decision.Separately, federal criminal laws were passed in 2024 to combat explicit deepfakes.View image in fullscreeneSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant during Senate estimates at Parliament House.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPIn her opening statement to the Senate committee reviewing the bill in July last year, the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said deepfakes had increased on the internet by 550% since 2019, and pornographic videos made up 99% of the deepfake material online, with 99% of that imagery of women and girls.“Deepfake image based abuse is not only becoming more prevalent but is also very gendered and incredibly distressing to the victim-survivor,” Inman Grant said.“Shockingly, thousands of open-source AI apps like these have proliferated online and are often free and easy to use by anyone with a smartphone.“So these apps make it simple and cost-free for the perpetrator, while the cost to the target is one of lingering and incalculable devastation.”Explore more on these topicsDeepfakeArtificial intelligence (AI)QueenslandnewsShareReuse this content"

Formerly part of the Soviet Union, it now outperforms countries with far larger populations and bigger budgets.There are multiple reasons for Estonia’s success but its embrace of all things digital sets it apart. While England and other nations curtail phone use in school amid concerns that it undermines concentration and mental health, teachers in Estonia actively encourage pupils to use theirs as a learning tool.Now Estonia is launching a national initiative calledAI Leap, which it says will equip students and teachers with “world-class artificial intelligence tools and skills”. Licences are being negotiated with OpenAI, which will make Estonia a testbed for AI in schools. The aim is to provide free access to top-tier AI learning tools for 58,000 students and 5,000 teachers by 2027, starting with 16- and 17-year-olds this September.Teachers will be trained in the technology, focusing on self-directed learning and digital ethics, and prioritising educational equity and AI literacy. Officials say it will make Estonia “one of the smartest AI-using nations, not just the most tech-saturated”.Kristina Kallas, Estonia’s minister of education and research, said during a visit to London this week for the Education World Forum: “I know the scepticism and carefulness of most of the European countries regarding screens, mobile phones and technology. The thing is that in the Estonian case, society in general is much more open and prone to using digital tools and services. Teachers are no different.”Kallas said there were no mobile phone bans in schools in Estonia. On the contrary: a smartphone is seen as part and parcel of Estonia’s highly successful digital education policy. “I’ve not heard of any problems, to be honest,” she said. “The schools establish the rules, which are followed on a local level. We use mobile phones for learning purposes.”She added: “We have local elections coming in October this year. In local elections, 16-year-olds can vote, and they can vote online through their mobile phones. So we want them to use mobile phones to do their civic duty, to participate in an election, to get the information, to analyse the political platforms.“It’s a little bit strange if we would not allow them to use them in school, in an educational setting. That would be a very confusing message to 16-year-olds – vote online, vote on a mobile, but don’t use ChatGPT on your phone to do education learning.”Kallas insisted: “We are not banning. We’ve given guidelines, especially regarding younger children – younger than 12 and 13 years old – when it comes to how mobile phones should be used or should not be used, but most schools have regulated it themselves.“They have regulated it so that mobile phones are not used during the breaks, and in the lessons they are used when the teacher asks for the phones to be taken out because there is some assignment or exercise that is done with the help of phones.”Rather than trying to resist new technology, Estonia has embraced it. In 1997 there was huge investment in computers and network infrastructure as part of itsTiigrihüpe(Tiger Leap) programme. All schools were rapidly connected to the internet. Now smartphones and AI are seen as the next step.Kallas talks about an AI revolution entailing the end of essays for homework, a farewell to the memorise/repeat/apply learning model relied on for hundreds of years, and a shift to oral exams. The challenge is to develop higher cognitive skills in young people, because AI can do the rest better and faster.“It’s a matter of urgency,” she said. “We are facing this evolutionary, developmental challenge now. We either evolve into faster-thinking and higher-level-thinking creatures, or the technology will take over our consciousness.”Explore more on these topicsSchoolsSmartphonesEstoniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

From an apartment on Mann Island, former Liverpool managers Jürgen Klopp and Sir Kenny Dalglish waved to jubilant supporters below.Man arrested after car hits pedestrians during Liverpool FC victory paradeRead moreJust after 6pm, on nearby Water Street, the scene was one of devastation. A car, driven by a 53-year-old white British male from the Liverpool area, collided with a number of pedestrians including four children.Twenty-seven people were taken to hospital, with two sustaining serious injuries, including one of the children.Another 20 were treated for minor injuries at the scene and others self-presented at hospitals on Merseyside later in the day.Ambulances were parked outside Liverpool town hall over three hours later.Approximately 20 to 30 casualties were being treated in the Riva Blu Italian restaurant across the road.One man from Birmingham, who asked not to be named, had been treated for back and leg injuries having been knocked over in the incident.He had spent the day celebrating on the Strand but, unable to get a signal to send photographs to the family WhatsApp group, decided to head up Water Street in search of better coverage. “I won’t be sending any now,” he said. “I’d had the most wonderful day but now I don’t even want to think about what I just saw.”His incomprehension was understandable. It had been a magnificent day, a celebration 35 years in the waiting that had attracted Liverpool supporters from as far as New Zealand, Australia and Thailand.Michael Holdener, 28, had cycled with a group of friends for 20 days from Unteriberg in Switzerland, via France, Germany and the Netherlands, to see his beloved team parade a record-equalling 20th league title. Liverpool fans, and Klopp, had been denied the opportunity when Liverpool won their 19th league championship in 2020, ending the club’s 30-year wait for that particular honour, due to the Covid pandemic.And now this.Arne Slot, the Liverpool head coach who had delivered the trophy in his first season in charge, had earlier described the day as the best of his short but successful Anfield career. Slot, a title winner at his previous club Feyenoord, had said on the team bus: “This is by far the number one day, this is beyond what you can expect, what you can dream of maybe. This is unbelievable. I won a few things before and they were beautiful but this you cannot compare with anything. Young, old, every age is here. You look the fans in the eyes and you see it all. You can hardly imagine that there are still more citizens of Liverpool still to come. All through the route there are so many people. This is beyond my dreams.”And now this.Liverpool city council estimated that half a million people had lined the 10-mile route around the city to witness the trophy parade. Ignoring the miserable weather, they had started taking their places from 8am to get the best views of Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and a tearful Trent Alexander-Arnold, who is leaving his boyhood club for Real Madrid this summer.Birmingham New Street train station was full of Liverpool fans attempting to reach the city by mid-morning.The Strand, the road that runs along the front of the city centre past the Three Graces, was a spectacular sight as the Liverpool bus slowly made its way through, the air filled with red smoke.But 25 minutes later four people were trapped under a car on Water Street and dozens lay injured.A day of jubilation had turned into one of horror. Projections celebrating Liverpool’s title triumph on the Royal Albert Dock were switched off. Liverpool FC curtailed all social media activity as soon as they became aware of the seriousness of the incident and a staff party, scheduled to take place on Tuesday, was cancelled.Slot and his players were updated on developments as soon as they stepped off the coach. A horrendous end to what should have been, and what had been, a joyous day.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Altmaier broke the No 4 seed’s big serve five times on Court Simonne-Mathieu and ended the Californian’s 15-match grand slam winning streak against players ranked outside the top 50.Emma Raducanu admits struggle in gritty French Open win over Wang XinyuRead moreFritz’s exit followed another by a top-10 American: No 9 seed Navarro was bounced from the women’s tournament earlier on Monday. Navarro only lasted 57 minutes, losing 6-0, 6-1 to Jessica Bouzas Maneiro of Spain.It was a major setback for the 24-year-old, who reached the fourth round in Paris last year before her first grand slam semi-final at the US Open. Navarro had a strong start to the season, including a quarter-final at the Australian Open and a WTA 500 title at Mexico’s Merida Open, but has struggled on clay this spring.In September, Fritzlost the US Open final to Jannik Sinner, becoming the first US man to reach a major final since Andy Roddick in 2009. In Paris, Fritz was the highest-seeded American man at the French Open since Roddick was No 3 in 2007.While hard courts are Fritz’s preferred surface, he did have a run to the second week on the red clay of Roland-Garros a year ago, making it into the fourth round before losing to Casper Ruud. This is not Altmaier’s first big win at the French Open.

So there he was at Valdebebas on a Monday afternoon in a classic dark suit and his first day in a new job – just 24 hours – or so he claimed – after he was told it was his.Alonso’s appointment has been an open secret for weeks but Real had waited until the day before the end of the season to announce thedeparture of Carlo Ancelottiand until the day after to announce the arrival of his successor. The following morning, there he was, keen to keep up the illusion. Alonso had been able to watch and analyse Real’s games, which must have taken some time, yet asked when he found out, he said: “Yesterday, when I saw the statement. It was evident then. How could I not find out?”Xabi Alonso, ‘one of the greatest legends of Real Madrid’, appointed as head coachRead moreAlonso had, of course, found out sooner, an agreement reached after Real’sEuropean elimination by Arsenaland contact going back further, but this was an issue that he was keen to avoid on his opening day. Yet if there was a determination to avoid questions of where he had come from, there were some brief glimpses of where he wants to go, as he talked about signings being “discussed and agreed” with the club, constructing a “proactive” and “balanced” team of “excitement, energy and ambition” in which “everyone knows what we’re trying to do collectively, which will help the individuals flourish”.One of those will be Jude Bellingham, who Alonso said he sees as a midfielder, rather than in the second striker role he occupied for his first season in Spain and some of this second campaign. Alonso’s discussion of the Englishman was perhaps among the most revealing of his answers in tactical terms, hinting at an analysis that perhaps calls for Bellingham to move less but in a more structured manner, rather than exhausting himself playing everywhere.“He’s a special player; his emergence is that of a generational player forReal Madrid. He is 21 and he is going to be fundamental for the future of the club. It’s a good moment to work with him. I see him as a midfielder. We will try to make him as efficient as possible.”Alonso also said he had an idea about how to get Kylian Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior working together and said that he was going to need Rodrygo. He sought to avoid taking sole responsibility for the arrival of Dean Huijsen and thedeparture of Luka Modricbut said that transfers would be talked about with the club – which would represent a step away from the coaching only model Ancelotti accepted.“I want players to play where they are most comfortable, where they can best show their qualities. The good thing is that we have good players. Then, from there, it’s my problem. I am lucky to have players of this level. Not just Kylian or Vinícius, but many others. They’re differential and we have to get the best out of them. I have ideas. There’s still a while before I meet them but it’s very important for me to communicate to them what it is we want.“These days football demands flexibility, dynamism, that you know how to move pieces. Of course I have an idea of how I want us to play but that idea of a fixed system sometimes [gives way to] something more dynamic. Will we play with four [at the back]? With three? We’ll see.“We have players who will interpret the idea well and work hard. The challenge now is to build a team, to get the potential out of all those players and ensure that we all work together as one,” Alonso said. “Because if we do we will have a strength that is … I’m not going to say unstoppable but very powerful.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One, because it means that we can accelerate processes, get to know each other sooner, see things that we want to be. Then it’s a chance to fight for another trophy. It’s the first Club World Cup and the ambition is complete. If we can bring together those two things then it can be a very good start, and as of today that is what I have in mind.

Efforts to enliven the race with mandatory pit stops fell flat on Sunday.McLaren’sLando Norris won in Monte Carloand was, despite the two pit-stop rule, in control throughout. Only two passes were made on track in 78 laps and drivers including Red Bull’s Max ­Verstappen, who ­finished fourth, and Mercedes’ George ­Russell, who was 11th, dismissed the rule change as all but pointless.‘We were almost doing Mario Kart’: Verstappen and Russell slate Monaco F1 GP pit stopsRead moreChristian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, believed the most important change required was to alter the layout to create one area where overtaking was at least feasible.“The ­fundamental problem is you cannot overtake here,” he said. “The cars are so big now that you just don’t have a chance to get alongside. It’s circuit specific, we’ve known that, it’s been on the calendar for 72 years. Everything has to move with the times ultimately.“It’s an iconic and historic circuit but if you look at how Monaco has changed, how much land they’ve reclaimed into the sea, I don’t think you’d need to do too much. There just needs to be one area where you can have an overtake and everybody knows that coming here the race was pretty much done on Saturday. We’ve introduced another dynamic with the pit stop, which, ultimately for the top 10, other than the retirement, nobody really changed position.”The race was marked by the ­leading teams matching each other through the pit stops and the absence of a safety car or red flag to bring an element of chance into ­proceedings. ­Further back, teams applied teamwork between drivers to ­create pit window gaps that involved ­deliberately driving slowly to the infuriation of others who were left impotent in a train on track. Very few were satisfied with the outcome.Norris said it had created jeopardy by the risk of mere fortune deciding the result rather than in the form of actual racing. “There’s not been any more overtaking here. I thought that was what was wanted,” he said. “Now you just give people opportunity by luck, by waiting for a red flag, waiting for a safety car. You aren’t getting a more deserved winner in the end of things.”The race organiser, the ­Automobile Club de Monaco, believes changing the track layout is next to ­impossible but Norris’s team principal, Andrea Stella, suggested it was worth ­bringing into the equation. “We should praise that Formula One and the FIA made an attempt to improve racing,” he said. “The main limitation remains the fact that you cannot overtake and this is quite structural as a limitation. I am not sure exactly how this can be modified just simply by imposing a certain number of pit stops.“I’m not sure there’s anything that can be done from a track layout point of view. I’ve never thought of this aspect but maybe there’s something that we should consider.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Such a model “disincentivises ethical conduct”, the letter says, and “precludes effective internal reform”.Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, promised widespread changes to the body’s practices when he was elected into the role following the Baur au Lac arrests and theresignation of the former presidentSepp Blatter. “We enter now a new era,” Infantino said in 2016. “We’ll restore the image of Fifa and make sure everybody will be happy with what we do.”Instead, in 2025 there is ­discontent among stakeholders and outside observers over the way the world’s most popular sport is being run. “It is time to recognise that these reforms have failed to usher in a new era of responsible governance at Fifa and that the organisation is structurally unfit to govern world football,” the letter reads. “Fifa is arguably more poorly governed today than it was 10 years ago.”The letter goes on to cite the Club World Cup this summer and its impact on the fixture calendar, the decision to grant the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia despite the country’s human rights abuses and the ­opacity of executive decision making, as examples of concerning trends.“This statement demonstrates not only the rank failure of the reforms enacted under the presidency of Gianni Infantino, but also the breadth of expert opposition to and frustration with Fifa’s dysfunctional ­governance model,” said Nick McGeehan, the co-director of human rights advocacy group FairSquare, which coordinated the letter.Bonita Mersiades, one of a group of whistleblowers to expose malfeasance in Fifa in the previous decade, said the culture had not changed in the intervening years. “I was on the inside during the Blatter era, where wrongdoing was out in the open and the need for reform was not understood and certainly not welcome,” said Mersiades, a signatory to the letter. “The 2015 raids were a reckoning. But 10 years on, while there may be process and policy in place under Gianni Infantino, the culture remains the same. And when it comes to process versus culture, culture wins every time. True reform demands more than new systems – it requires new values. We’re not there yet.”In a statement a Fifa spokesperson said: “A few weeks ago, the very same authorities that had to intervene [against] Fifa in 2015 – the US attorney general and FBI director – travelled to our offices in Miami, to meet Fifa leadership and work together as a highly respected partner.“The 2015 scandal marked a ­turning point for the organisation, allowing a new Fifa to emerge. Thanks to the intervention of the US authorities back in 2015, we have been able to fundamentally change Fifa from a toxic organisation at the time, to a respected and trusted global sports governing body focusing on its ­mandate to develop football all around the world.”Fifa points to internal reforms around financial governance, positive assessments by the Association of Summer Olympic Federations as to their transparency and good governance, and a sevenfold increase in investment in football development around the world as among the positive changes made by the organisation in the past decade.Explore more on these topicsFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He needed a knee reconstruction and the idea was for him to return in early December. That was before he sustained nerve damage to a tendon during the procedure.“After the operation, I couldn’t lift my foot or my toes,” Milner said. “December 31 was the first time I saw any flicker of life. It [the complication] wasn’t age-related. It was just a bit of bad luck – one in however many thousand.“There was a chance I might not have come back at all. I didn’t know whether I could walk properly again let alone play football. I don’t think many people would have come back from this. The medical staff have been incredible, Sean Duggan [the Brighton physiotherapist] has been absolutely unbelievable. We worked hard and the hard work’s paid off. To be part of it on the pitch again made it all worthwhile.”Milner was asked whether any medics had told him he might have to retire. “Nobody said quit the game,” he replied. “There were obviously doubts from some people that I would get back but nobody said quit it. Not many people have had this and with my age it was highly unlikely I would get back. But I think that was one of the things that drove me most.”Milner turns 40 in January and he is determined to have an impact next season in what would be his 24th in the Premier League. This time out, he became the first player to play in 23 seasons in the competition. He made his debut for Leeds as a 16-year-old at West Ham in November 2002.“I would like to keep playing,” he said. “I’ve definitely got another year left in me. We’re in talks with the club and quite close so it will be nice to be here and be part of the team and help the boys.”Explore more on these topicsBrighton & Hove AlbionnewsShareReuse this content"

A deal for Ekitike, who has scored 22 goals in 48 appearances in all competitions this season, is complicated by Frankfurt’s asking price of £84m.The France Under-21 international joined the Bundesliga club from Paris Saint-Germain last summer. It is likely that Chelsea would try to reach a compromise on the fee if they push for the 22-year-old. Ekitike has also been linked with Liverpool and Manchester United.Sesko, the 21-year-old Slovenia international, has scored 26 goals for club and country this season. He reportedly has a release clause set at £62m and has been tracked by Chelsea for three years. Arsenal are also keen on Sesko, who has interest from at least two unnamed clubs.It remains to be seen who Chelsea will settle on as they try to provide more competition for Nicolas Jackson. The Senegal striker missed the crucial victoryagainst Nottingham Forestlast Sunday through suspension. The inexperienced Marc Guiu has deputised for Jackson at times. Christopher Nkunku has underwhelmed during his outings as a No 9 and is expected to leave Chelsea in the summer.There is a feeling that Delap’s physicality would make him an effective option for Enzo Maresca. The argument is that Maresca’s patient style of play would benefit from more punch in attack. Delap has also spoken to Everton, Newcastle and Manchester United. There is a sense that United’s chances of signing the England Under-21 international have been hit by their defeat in the Europa League final, meaning they have missed out on European qualification.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arsenal, the new champions of Europe, were given a heroes’ welcome in north London two daysafter their stunning victoryover Barcelona in the Champions League final.The scenes in Armoury Square, outside the Emirates Stadium, were reminiscent of those in Trafalgar Squarethe day after the Lionesses liftedtheir maiden European title in 2022, or those in the same N5 location when the Arsenal men’s team lifted the FA Cup in 2014 and 2015 (the 2017 occasion was cancelled by the Metropolitan police due to security risks in London, and Covid restrictions prevented a public celebration in 2020).In terms of women’s club football, in England, no trophy jamboree comes close to matching it. This was a celebration not ofArsenal Womenbut of Arsenal and the fruits of a long-term one‑club project were evident in the numbers that showed up less than 48 hours after the historic 1-0 defeat of Barcelona in Lisbon on Saturday evening.Steph Catley, the centre-back who anchored a phenomenal full‑team defensive effort alongside Leah Williamson, said moments after coming off the stage: “I had an idea in my head of what it would look like, but it didn’t equate to that. That was very special and something I’m so proud to be a part of.”View image in fullscreenArmoury Square was packed with thousands of fans as Arsenal celebrated their Champions League victory with a trophy lift outside the Emirates Stadium.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAIt had been short notice for the celebrations and some fans had turned up at 6am to get a prime position at the front of the barriers. Catley said: “It says everything. They always show up for us … as a female footballer, you look at Arsenal and you want to play there. You’ve got the support and everything you need. There are world-class players, but the fans make it so special. To bring them a trophy and thank them for their support is the best.”Williamson said: “You look at the turnout today and you think about what we’ve done over the last couple of years, how we’ve positioned ourselves and how the club have positioned us in terms of a respect point of view. Then to contribute to that with a trophy win, it feels like we did our bit. The work that’s been done behind the scenes for the last couple of years is world leading. Now there’s a trophy to match that and I’m very proud of that. This is the stuff that makes you stay and want to come back.”0:41Arsenal Women and Crystal Palace celebrate victory across London – videoThe trophies have been the missing piece, two League Cup wins in 2023 and 2024 not enough to satisfy the demands of the most decorated women’s team in England. “You have to win trophies, you have to,” Williamson said. “I’m so proud of what we do off the pitch, who we are, how we lead and how we carry ourselves, I’m so proud of that but I want to win and Arsenal should be winning.“I’ve looked at that legacy all my life and I wanted to contribute to it. I didn’t want to end my career just being loyal. Loyalty is great but loyalty with trophies is just something else. This week I’ve spoken to Tony Adams and Thierry Henry, people I watched, they were incredible and they won and that’s why they are remembered the way they are.”Fans were treated to speeches from the head coach,Renée Slegers, Williamson, Stina Blackstenius, scorer of the winning goal in Lisbon, and a very merry Katie McCabe before the trophy was brought on stage by two Arsenal in the Community participants, 11‑year‑old Daisy Martin and seven‑year‑old Celine Davie.

However, they have spent big too, the money invested in everything around the final – from the hotels and travel to the parties and Emirates Stadium celebrations – far exceeding the €350,000 (£293,000) prize pot for the winners, which is added to the money accrued throughout the tournament.For Williamson, a lifelong Arsenal fan who was a mascot when the team lifted a first European title in 2007 – the stadium facade behind the celebrations providing a fitting tribute to that side – it has been an extremely emotional bank holiday weekend.“I always said: ‘Trophy for England over trophy for Arsenal,’” she said. “Because, I just think you don’t pick your country, it’s a bit more of a fate thing, a bit more luck needs to be involved. But I feel ashamed now, because that feeling on Saturday was, I think right now, the happiest I’ve ever been in my whole entire life and I hope that other Arsenal fans are happy too.

I’ve watched every bit of footage so it lives as long as possible in my memory. Then I’ve been connecting with loads of people, like Tessa Payne, she was my under-10s coach, my first coach, I’ve wanted to reconnect with all those old faces, those people that have seen the journey over the years and the people that know how much I love Arsenal and know how much this would mean to me whether I was on the pitch or not.”Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenWomen's footballWomen's Champions LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

When the two buses carrying Oliver Glasner and his FA Cup winners rounded the corner of Holmesdale Road, red and blue smoke from flares filled the air as thousands of south Londoners showed their appreciation, with several shedding tears again.In the days since Eberechi Eze’swinner against Manchester Cityclinched Palace’s first major trophy, a sense of disbelief has been the overwhelming feeling for fans who are excitedly contemplating a foray into Europe next season.“This has been the best week of my life to share this with all these guys,” said an emotional Steve Parish, Palace’s chair. “Our fans are our superpower – that is what we’ve got that drives us forward.”View image in fullscreenFans in the packed streets around Selhurst Park greet the buses carrying the Crystal Palace players and staff.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAmbitious plans to host the parade in Crystal Palace Park – the club’s former home and where the Cup final was played between 1895 and 1914 – had failed to come to fruition. Croydon council’s chief executive denied rumours it had demanded £200,000 to host the celebrations in the borough, while neighbouring Bromley council revealed it had suggested a parade from the training ground in Beckenham via the park and then the stadium, but Palace “did not feel able to proceed in the time available with their ideas, given concerns raised by a range of organisations”.The result was a slimmed down route you could usually walk in about five minutes but it took Joel Ward, Marc Guéhi and co the best part of an hour to complete.0:41Arsenal Women and Crystal Palace celebrate victory across London – videoEven a downpour of rain as the buses made their way along Whitehorse Lane could not dampen the spirits, with 7,000 fans then piling on to the pitch at Selhurst Park to continue the celebrations that included a DJ set by Sister Bliss from Faithless, whose singer Maxi Jazz was a vice-president at Palace before his death in 2022.“I’ve been dancing all day,” said the French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta when he was called up onstage to collect his goal of the season award for his lob against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.View image in fullscreenJean-Philippe Mateta dons some suitable specs as he celebrates at the party on the pitch.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianWith planning permission having been granted last summer for a new stand that would take the stadium’s capacity to 34,000, work was expected to finally begin in the coming weeks but spiralling costs have caused further delays. It is estimated they could reach up to £240m.Uncertainty over the club’s ownership is another hurdle Parish must resolve, but holding on to Glasner, whose contract expires at the end of next season, will be his main priority, not to mention a number of players who are coveted by bigger clubs including Guéhi, Mateta and the Wembley hero Eze.“We couldn’t hope for a better group,” Parish said when he addressed the exultant crowd on the pitch. “To smash through the glass ceiling for this club and finally win something – their names will go down in history. They will always be loved here.”View image in fullscreenA tinfoil FA Cup had to make an appearance.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAsked what Glasner has done for Palace since taking over from Roy Hodgson as manager last February, he said: “Oliver doesn’t like coming second. Winning is a drug and I don’t see any reason at all why we can’t go and do it again. We need to deliver for the manager in the close season and the fans.”The Austrian has made a habit of winning trophies wherever he has been and has seemed to take Palace’s victory in his stride despite allowing himself to relax on a staff trip to Ibiza aftertheir midweek win against Wolves.View image in fullscreenA sign honours Eberechi Eze’s cup final contribution.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianGlasner showed his ruthless side during the final match of the seasonagainst Liverpool on Sundaywhen he took off Romain Esse after the £12m January signing from Millwall had been brought on as a substitute and later criticised his attitude.

Sunday brought Charlton promotion to the Championship and on MondayAFC Wimbledonheaded back to League One after three years away, a thump from Myles Hippolyte in first-half stoppage time enough to deny Walsall.The contest was low on thrills but style is not what makes this occasion grand. Until Hippolyte found the bottom right corner, it had looked a match heading for extra time or penalties, likely to be decided by either Tommy Simkin or Owen Goodman, two impressive young goalkeepers. And whileWalsallwere shaken into action in the second half, Wimbledon’s solidity shone through with an impenetrable defence. They celebrated victory and a clean sheet, just like they had done at this venue nine years ago against Plymouth, just like the Crazy Gang in 1988.AFC Wimbledon 1-0 Walsall: League Two playoff final – liveRead more“I did feel that we deserved it,” said Johnnie Jackson, the Wimbledon manager. “We had the better moments and the goal is the defining moment. We’ve had to be defensively at our best for the last four games. You don’t want it to be 1-0, you want it to be more comfy than that. But sometimes one’s enough if you can defend the way we can.”This was billed as the division’s leading goalscorers against the tightest defence, Wimbledon having conceded just 35 during the regular season. But that line evades the whole truth; Walsall were free-scoring in the first half of the campaign, 2025 beginning with a 12-point lead at the top, grateful for the 18 goals supplied by the on-loan Nathan Lowe. Then came his recall to Stoke and the ugliest of slides: three wins in their last 21 league matches, automatic promotion denied on the final day by Bradford City’s late win against Fleetwood.Mat Sadler’s side had enough resolve to advance past an in‑form Chesterfield in the playoff semi-finals, while Wimbledon’s grit was present against Notts County, Goodman, on loan from Crystal Palace, producing two shutouts. There was no need to overthink: both sides strode out unchanged.Goodman began in front of his own supporters, blue and yellow balloons bouncing away, their voices strong even if the early exchanges were uneventful. Wimbledon were more willing to keep the ball grounded and produced the first strike on target after half an hour, Marcus Browne forcing Simkin to get down low to his left. The neutral could have been forgiven for changing channels.View image in fullscreenWalsall goalkeeper Tommy Simkin claims the ball from the feet of AFC Wimbledon’s Matty Stevens.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAWimbledon were the only ones threatening danger, Walsall’s punts forward swept away comfortably by the blue backline. Then came the first true moment of quality, just before the break. Browne’s volley met a block in the area but retreated to Hippolyte inside the D, his first‑time strike into the ground beating the shirts in front as well as Simkin. Walsall had played like a side ready to grind through extra time but urgency was required.It came quickly in the second half. Nathan Asiimwe’s cross from the right-hand side found Jamille Matt advancing towards the front post, his cute touch guiding the ball through the legs of the onrushing Goodman. But the lack of pace allowed Riley Harbottle to retreat and hack the ball off the line.Sunshine retreated in place of a steady downpour and the hour-mark brought the introduction of Albert Adomah, 37 years young, and a Championship playoff winner with Aston Villa in 2019. His fellow substitute Levi Amantchi had a dinked effort saved comfortably by Goodman as Walsall finally began to launch waves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The prestige of the arch could not revive a season that had long lost its way.“First half, we just didn’t quite impose ourselves on the game in the way we wanted to,” Sadler said. “Second half, I thought we gave it a go and we played the way we want to play. We were a bit braver in possession, showed a bit more courage in trying to work it out wide and just increase the tempo. That’s the way we wanted to play to begin with.“For us, you have to use these things as motivation and fuel.

Negotiations have started over a fee with Leverkusen, who want £126m for the Germany international. That would comfortably eclipse Liverpool’s record transfer,the £85m that brought Darwin Núñez from Benficain 2022, but the club hope to structure a deal with Leverkusen accepting a lower initial fee plus achievable add-ons.Erik ten Hag returns to management as new Bayer Leverkusen head coachRead moreFenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owner, spent modestly during Arne Slot’s successful debut season, signing onlyFederico Chiesa from Juventus, in a deal that could rise to £12m, andthe Valencia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvilifor £29m. The club are in a position to spend heavily and there is hope inside Anfield that Wirtz and Frimpong, who has a £30m release clause, could be secured early in the summer transfer window.Werner, when asked if he expected a busy transfer window for the new champions, said before the bus parade: “It’s already busy.” He also said he expected the squad to be even stronger for the start of their title defence. “We go again. It never gets old, winning. We owe it to all of our supporters to bring back a team even better next season.”Wirtz, who can play across the frontline, is one of the most coveted players in Europe and is understood to be impressed by Liverpool’s plans. The Leverkusen managing director, Simon Rolfes, has confirmed Liverpool’s pursuit of his club’s prized asset, saying: “There is concrete interest fromLiverpool, that’s clear, but at the moment there’s no further status.”Frimpong has already passed a Liverpool medical and the arrival of the right-back, a close friend of Wirtz, should be confirmed when the window opens officially on Sunday. The Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez is another target for Liverpool.Slot said it would be ideal to have new signings in place early, with preseason scheduled to begin on 8 July. The Liverpool head coach said on Sunday: “This club doesn’t start [on transfers] after today or from today onwards. There is so much hard work already done behind the scenes this season to find out which targets we have and try to sign them. I have all the confidence that if we have addressed the right player, we try to sign that player but let’s see when that is going to happen and if that’s going to happen, because I’m very happy with the squad we already have.”Liverpool’s transfer budget is expected to be increased by outgoings. Núñez, Chiesa, Caoimhín Kelleher, Kostas Tsimikas and Ben Doak are among those who could leave this summer.There remains uncertainty over Ibrahima Konaté’s long-term future at the club. The influential defender will enter the final 12 months of his contract this summer and admits there has been little progress during talks over an extension. He said: “Progressing? Not really. My agent met the club last week but I don’t know what will happen. I cannot say what my agent said to me but yeah, we will see what will happen.”Virgil van Dijk, meanwhile, has revealed it was his idea to be presented with the Premier League trophy on Sunday by the former Liverpool captain and defender Alan Hansen. The 69-year-old was seriously ill last summer and received a rapturous reception when parading the trophy in front of the Kop alongside Van Dijk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He kept messaging me every week, ‘you good to go for dubs [doubles] at Roland Garros’,” said Thompson, who had been struggling with a litany of injuries himself.Novak Djokovic says he remains close to ‘amazing person’ Andy MurrayRead more“I know he was back home in Australia training on clay, but a few days ago, Nick told me that he’s done something to his knee, so unfortunately, he just couldn’t be here. He was pretty down. He told me he doesn’t know how much more of these injuries he can take, and you’ve just got to feel for him.“Because as much as he says things in the media, I think he loves playing tennis and he loves being on court, so it’s disappointing that he can’t be here on the court.”The former Wimbledon finalist Kyrgios, whose recent career has become a stop-start affair riddled with injury concerns, had declared only a couple of weeks ago that he would reunite with Thompson, whose regular doubles partner Max Purcell is serving a ban for infringing doping regulations.The pair had played as juniors, finishing runners-up in the 2012 US Open.But when the draw was announced on Monday, it was confirmed Thompson would line up instead alongside fellow Australian Jason Kubler for a first-round match on Tuesday against French pair Quentin Halys and Albano Olivetti.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m hoping that he can play, but it just depends on how his knee is,” said Thompson.Kyrgios, who has been plagued by knee and foot injuries and had reconstructive surgery on his wrist, thought there was some light at the end of the tunnel when he won his first singles match for two-and-a-half years against American Mackenzie McDonald in Miami in March.On day two of play at Roland Garros, Alja Tomljanovic outplayed the new teenage Morocco Open champion Maya Joint 6-1, 6-3, while Alexei Popyrin ended his French Open drought and Daria Kasatkina savoured her first grand slam win under the Australian flag.But with nine Australians in action on a manic day in Paris, there were inevitably casualties littered around the perennial red tennis graveyard with Aleksandar Vukic, Chris O’Connell, Daria Saville, Kim Birrell and a battered Jordan Thompson all succumbing.

As he reflected on his time working with Murray, Djokovic insisted that their decision to part ways was mutual.French Open: US shocks as top-10 seeds Fritz and Navarro lose in first roundRead more“He did congratulate me [on winning Geneva], and he said: ‘Now that you have a proper coach, you’re winning tournaments,’” said Djokovic, laughing. “I don’t know. I didn’t take that as a joke. Of course he was joking, but I think I have said enough, but I will say it again: Andy is just an amazing person. First of all, someone that I have spent most of my career with since the very young age on the tour, travelling, playing him, facing him in the earliest days, under-12 and all the way through to the last days of his career. For him to join my team and for us to give a shot to this player/coach relationship was really an incredible thing for tennis and for both of us. I was very privileged and honoured.”Djokovic continued: “I feel like we have a closer relationship because of our working relationship in the last four, five months.”As Djokovic prepared for his first-round match against Mackenzie McDonald, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner took their first steps forward with straight-set victories in Paris. Alcaraz, the second seed and defending champion, described himself as pleasantly surprised by his level as he eased through with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 win over Giulio Zeppieri of Italy. In the evening session, the top-seeded Sinner held off a late surge from home favourite Arthur Rinderknech in an electric atmosphere on Court Philippe-Chatrier to close out a 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 win. Sinner has now won 15 consecutive grand slam matches after winning the US Open and Australian Open.Sinner’s victory sets up a significant second-round match with Richard Gasquet, the 38-year-old veteran and former world No 7 who is competing in his final tournament this week. Gasquet, who has been a constant presence in the sport for more than two decades since he emerged on the tour as a teenage prodigy, defeated his fellow French wildcard Terence Atmane 6-2, 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 to advance.Taylor Fritz, the fourth seed, was thefirst significant casualtyin the men’s draw as he was defeated 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 by Daniel Altmaier of Germany, ending a bitter clay court season marred by earlier injury struggles.Elsewhere, a tearful Naomi Osaka briefly halted her press conference after suffering another heartbreaking loss in a significant tournament, losing 6-7 (1), 6-1, 6-4 to the 1oth seed, Paula Badosa. Despite some promising results, Osaka has struggled to rediscover her old form since returning to the sport after giving birth to her daughter, Shai, last January. She has reached the third round of a grand slam tournament on only one occasion since her return and when she did so at the Australian Open this year, she was forced to retire due to injury.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Former players say playing outside big cities can help bring unity and cohesionJacob UittiMon 26 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 05.30 EDTShareTwo-timeNBAAll-Star Reggie Theus remembers the 1981 playoffs. In a “big time” opening round series, his Chicago Bulls faced the New York Knicks. The first game tipped off in one of the world’s most famous arenas, Madison Square Garden, and it included stars such as Artis Gilmore, Bill Cartwright and Michael Ray Richardson. The Bulls won game one and went on to win the series, playing Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics in the next round. Theus scored 37 points in the clincher against New York, an overtime victory in the Windy City. But it was a thrill he never quite felt again.While Theus made the playoffs three more times in his long career, he never again featured in such a glitzy postseason showdown like Chicago versus New York. During his 13-years in the league, the he suited up for teams like the Kansas City and then Sacramento Kings (the team relocated to NorCal in 1985) and Orlando Magic. In a way, he was like a kettle moving from the front to the back burners. Indeed, more often than not, the NBA’s glamour markets – cities like Los Angeles, Boston, New York and Chicago – get the attention. But those aren’t itsonlyteams, nor are they necessarily the places with the most success in any one season.The strange twilight of Russell Westbrook, the NBA’s ultimate fetish playerRead moreIn this year’s playoffs, many of the franchisescame from small markets, including the top seeds in each conference, the Oklahoma City Thunder and Cleveland Cavaliers, as well as several of its now-Conference finalists. But while big markets like New York, Miami or Golden State can draw free-agents thanks to their reputations and attraction for nightlife and entertainment, it’s hard not to wonder what life is like for the pros who live and hoop in smaller, more modest locales?For Theus, who played more years in places like Sacramento than he did Chi-town, the difference felt obvious. “You just get that hometown feel that small markets have,” Theus says. “Everyone sort of knows each other on a personal level.” Some teams, he says, just have a family feel to them. One organization he cites is San Antonio. While Theus never played for the Spurs, he sees how the culture that squad built over decades led to winning, stability and consistency. “There aren’t a lot of different things getting in the way there,” he says.While some fans may think that small town life for an NBA star is boring, Theus explains that it was quite the opposite. “You end up doing what the city has to offer,” Theus says. “I’m an archer and [Sacramento and Orlando] had a lot of hunting and fishing for me. It was great. I don’t know anybody that was bored or didn’t have fun. You did a lot more things together with your teammates. Small towns are personal, which is part of the charm.”When Theus played in the 1980s and 1990s, life was different than it is today. If you were in Sacramento, there wasn’t much national media exposure. Today, though, the reigning NBA MVP, Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, has already been featured ina number of significant TV commercials. As have players like Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo. Thanks to social media, NBA League Pass and streaming services, any player anywhere can become a household name. But when Theus played, it wasn’t nearly so easy to get national attention.“Small markets sometimes feel like they’re on an island by themselves,” he says. But there’s also a big benefit to that, he notes: “[The players] become closer.” Theus says he is still in regular touch with teammates he had in Sacramento and Orlando. But that’s not the same with those in Chicago. It’s a tradeoff. In smaller markets there’s less attention but with that comes, perhaps, a more normal life.“If you’re in Chicago, LA, New York, there are no other places like that,” Theus says. “Those are the three biggest media markets around. So, obviously there’s no place like that. The nightlife – and when I say the nightlife, I’m thinking of dinner spots, entertainment and so forth – those three places areunique.”Age can also be a factor in how you see playing in a smaller market. When Theus played in Chicago, he was in his early 20s – and the world was his oyster. When he was in Orlando, he was more mature, and in his 30s. In between, he was in sleepy Sacramento. Today’s NBA stars earn tens of millions of dollars a year. That affords a lavish life, from private jets to vacations around the globe. If you’re young and want to party, you can find a way today, even if you’re in a smaller city. Still, though, when it comes to a city’s reputation or celebrityfans? Some have all the luck.“There is no place like Madison Square Garden,” four-time All-Star Michael Ray Richardson tells the Guardian. “Sugar,” as he was known then, played in the Big Apple for four years before suiting up across the river in the smaller New Jersey for four more. “In New York, you got all the movie stars and actors and all of that,” he says. “In New Jersey, you really didn’t have none of that.”For Richardson, who now lives in Lawton, about 70 miles south of Oklahoma City, he’s seen what a winning team can mean to a region that is otherwise devoid of major pro sports. It’s something to rally around, he says, to enjoy together as a community. A winner like OKC can make a state feel like one giant college campus. “The whole state is going crazy,” says Richardson, “because there’s no other professional team here. So, if you go to anOklahoma City Thundergame, it’s like a college atmosphere. It’s unreal.”Robert Parish won three titles with Bird and the Celtics in the prime of his career, and a fourth with Michael Jordan’s Bulls. But in between, he played for two years in Charlotte, which at the time was an expansion team in one of the NBA’s smallest markets. Comparing the places, Parish says tradition stands out. If there’s history, there’s more to cheer for, although history is not always connected to size – just look at how the Packers are intertwined with the lore of Green Bay and the NFL. The same goes for the Spurs in San Antonio“The obvious difference is reputation,” Parish says. “The larger cities [often] have that long, rich history of being loud, loyal and appreciative with crazy fans.” Still, Parish says, victories translate to both types of NBA cities. “The celebrity athletes got the love [in Charlotte] because the Hornets gave the fans a reason to be proud – winning! Same reason for the fan loyalty in bigger markets.”There may be no team in the world with as much tradition as the Celtics – thanks, in part, to Parish. But it’s something Theus recognizes, too. “When you think about the Boston Celtics,” Theus says, “when you think about LA and Chicago, the sports history is a big factor. The lineage runs deeper because it’s been there for so long.” He adds, “Of course, Sacramento has grown up quite a bit now. But when we first got there, we had to tell the fans they weren’t supposed to clap so hard for the other team! … There was a real learning curve.”Explore more on these topicsNBAOklahoma City ThunderBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Democrats should clearly make the case for deficits to work for the peopleMon 26 May 2025 13.08 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 17.22 EDTShareDonald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” budgetsqueakedthrough the US House of Representatives last Thursday – a shiny populist package hiding a brutal class agenda. No taxes ontips! Biggerchild tax credits! But look closer and the bill is a sleight of hand. The middle-class perks expire in 2028 – just asMr Trump’s second termwould end – while permanent tax cuts for the rich, and delayed cuts tomeans-tested welfare, entrench inequality. It’s not a budget. It’s a bait-and-switch. It turns Democrats’ fiscal caution into a liability – one that punishes their ownbase. Republicans understand what Democrats still don’t: deficits aren’t the danger. It’s what you do with them that matters.This bill supercharges inequality:a $1.1tn giveawayto Americans earning more than$500,000a year – funded by pushing poorer families offMedicaidandfood assistance. It slashes green energy subsidies.Expertssay it could add $3.1tn to the debt – but it’s more than millionaire tax breaks. ItraisesImmigration and Customs Enforcement funding by 365% for detention, 500% for deportations – fuel for Mr Trump’s crackdown.It’s also trickle-up economics sold as working‑class salvation. Democrats voting against it now face the optics of opposing “tax relief for waitresses” – even though athirdof such workers make too little to pay income tax and won’t benefit at all. The bill now moves to the Senate, whereRepublicansmust juggle fiscal hawkishness onwelfarewith silence on pro-rich tax cuts – hopingvoterswon’t notice theirhypocrisy. No filibuster looms, but any Senate changes must pass with a simple majority - and then survive the House, where even modest tweaks could alienate hardliners or upset fragile support.But too many Democrats remain trapped by outdated budget dogma. While Republicans rack updeficitsfor the rich, Democrats cling to the Reagan-eraByrd ruleand “pay for” logic – treating a1970s economyas today’s reality. The former is a procedural constraint, but it was born of a political age obsessed with balanced budgets, and it continues to shrink ambition by demanding offsets for moral imperatives. In 2021, the most effectiveanti-child-poverty policyin decades expired because some Democrats fretted over funding it, despiterecordcorporate profits.The US needs to tax thewealthyproperly – not least because rampant inequality is destroying democracy. But the economist Stephanie Kelton is right that thequestionabout deficits isn’t so much “how big?” but “who benefits?” That’s the language Democrats need. Not budget sermons. Deficits should be for public purpose, notprivate plunder. Rather than scare stories about debt, Democrats should say America can run a deficit to fund healthcare, housing and green tech – not to bankroll authoritarian deportation squads or gift cash to the donor class.The real risk isn’t rejecting Mr Trump’s tax‑and‑spend agenda – it’s countering it with arithmetic. Voters don’t want better calculations, they want better convictions. In2021, Joe Biden urgedconservative Democratsto break their addiction to “pay-fors” and embrace a politics of purpose – spending driven by values, not accounting gimmicks. Their refusal is partly why the party struggles with its message today. Mr Trump’s budget may blow up the deficit, but it also blows up the illusion that Democrats can win with numbers. The only way out of the trap is to fight not over how much the federal government spends but whom it spends it on.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS economyRepublicansDemocratsJoe BidenEconomicseditorialsShareReuse this content"

The swift restraining order comes as a relief. But it is no cause for complacency.Attacks will not stop, and it is naive to think that this is all primarily a Harvard problem, or even only a challenge to higher education.Noem’s letter to Harvardmakes clear that Trump and his sycophants will weaponize the state against anyone who incurs their displeasure. Courts may prevent the worst, but the whole pattern has to end if we want to have any hope of living in a country free of fear and featuring at least minimum respect for the rule of law.As Harvard’slawsuit against the Department of Homeland Securityrightly pointed out, Noem’s revocation fits into the Trump administration’s orgy of vengeance prompted by Harvard’s refusal to comply with evidently illegal demands issued in mid-April. Among other things, Trumpistshad assertedtheir right to determine appropriate levels of “viewpoint diversity” among faculty and students. After Harvard sued, $2.2bn in research funds were frozen, followed by Linda McMahon, the education secretary, asserting at a cabinet meeting on 30 April that Harvard was failing to report “foreign money that comes in”. This line of attack has now been extended with absurd claims that Harvard “coordinates with the Chinese Communist Party” and is somehow “pro-terrorist”.The background noise to the official letters has been a steady stream of social media posts from the president, throwing invective at Harvard instead of conducting the serious government business of maligning Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift. The founder ofa university whose attendees received a $25m settlementhas accused the US’s oldest university of “scamming the public”, constituting a “threat to democracy”, and exposing innocent young Americans to “crazed lunatics” (as opposed to non-crazed lunatics). It is a well-known pattern in authoritarian regimes that underlings try to please the leader by anticipating his wishes and imitating his style. Official letters, posts, and press statements from DHS and the Department of Education not only fail to provide evidence and violate procedural safeguards; they not only make up ad hoc demands that have no basis in law; they also contain the signature capital letters, spelling mistakes, and kindergarten-level invective familiar from the president’s rhetoric. It is governance driven by a desire to please Fox viewers, online Maga mobs, and the Avenger-in-Chief.Incompetence hardly makes the measures harmless. They instill fear even when courts step in (and no, not all Ivy League undergrads are spoilt kids who never have anything to fear). Noem, in a further escalation, demanded footage and audio from all protests at Harvard. It is a clear signal for young people to shut up and fall in line. But there was also a signal to foreign faculty: the letter emphasized that it was a “privilege to employ aliens on campus”. The threat aligns withthe nativism of xenophobe-in-chief Stephen Miller, who is not just going after people who are in the country without proper paperwork – foreigners as such are a problem.But Noem’s rhetoric also aligned withthe logic of authoritarian populist leaderswho claim uniquely to represent what they call “the real people”: even citizens will not be free from the accusation by Trump and his sycophants that they are not proper Americans. Trump, at the April 30th cabinet meeting,declared: “The students they have, the professors they have, the attitude they have, is not American.” And Noem made it clear in her letter that her weaponization of the state will not be confined to campus; she wrote that the “evils of anti-Americanism” have to be rooted out in “society” at large.We can draw larger lessons from this – so far – failed attack (eight investigations, involving six different agencies, are still ongoing). One has to be ready – Harvard’s lawyers clearly were. Universities have to stand with each other; Noem warned all of them that they have to “get their act together” or else. Not least, university leaders have to explain to a larger public how Trumpists, in an unprecedented spree of national self-destruction, are busy preventing cancer cures, damaging American soft power, and killing one of the country’s major exports, namely higher education.As with so many other Trump policies, the assault on universities is actually not popular. Even after years of journalists and some professors priming people to think that campus is controlled by woke commissars and “Marxist maniacs” (Trump’s expression – I am still looking for them in the Economics Department),a clear majority of Americansdisapprove of Trump’s approach to higher education. Conservatives have stoked resentment of “liberal eggheads” for decades, but when their children get sick, they will still want to have access to the best medical schools; no parents wants their kids, away at college, to becomepawns– as the Harvard Crimson put it – in political games and subject to an administration’s caprice.

It is about battling those who want to take us backwardsMon 26 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 05.30 EDTShareYesterday, I led a private memorial service at ​George Floyd’s graveside​, along with his family, in Houston, Texas. Once that was over, we visited the housing project where Floyd and his siblings grew up.Half a decade after Floydwas taken from them, they were keen, as are we, to ensure his life and legacy will not be forgotten – and to remind the world why the fight for police accountability continues.He died in front of the entire world. Everyone saw the phone footage of the incident where a white officer in Minneapolis kneeled on Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes as he repeatedly said “I can’t breathe”, and cried out for his mother. His desperate pleas for help were ignored by those sworn to serve and protect the public; but they were heard in every corner of the globe.The movement for police reform gained renewed fire, and people from all walks of life demanded systemic change and the protection of Black lives. Five years later, while the officer convicted of Floyd’s murderis behind bars, the current climate in the US and regressive actions from those in power have set us back and prevented substantive police accountability.Just a few days shy of this sombre fifth anniversary, Donald Trump’s department of justice announced thatit would back awayfrom cases to force reforms on police departments – including in Louisville, Kentucky, and in Minneapolis, the city where Floyd was killed. This outrageous decision is not a surprise; it is just the latest roadblock in the fight for police reform and justice. It is an insult to the mothers, fathers, children and loved ones of all those killed at the hands of law enforcement. The consent decrees and small incremental changes that were achieved after tireless advocacy, organising, protests and political courage have been dismantled by a department that should be protecting the civil rights of individuals, not eliminating them.This move isn’t just a policy reversal. It’s a moral retreat that sends a chilling message that accountability is optional when it comes to Black and Brown victims. Trump is shamelessly weaponising the justice department against marginalised communities. The decision to dismiss these lawsuits with prejudice solidifies a dangerous political precedent that police departments are above scrutiny. The timing is no coincidence; it is an insult to Floyd’s family and the loved ones of victims such asSandra Bland,Tyre Nichols,Breonna Taylor,Eric Garnerand countless others whose names we may never even know.View image in fullscreenBridgett Floyd, sister of George Floyd, speaks outside the Lincoln Memorial during the Commitment March in Washington DC, 28 August 2020.Photograph: Chris Tuite/ImageSpace/Rex/ShutterstockI remember delivering the eulogies for Floyd (one in Minneapolis and one in his native Houston) like it was yesterday. There was so much frustration, anger, disgust and exhaustion permeating throughout the US and, in turn, in many nations across the world. In fact, his death sparked global protests against racial injustice, particularly at the hands of law enforcement. Many young people mobilised and hit the streets for the first time, and more than 200,000 folks joined us in the nation’s capital for amarch on Washingtonin August 2020 to call attention to ongoing police injustice. Despite a pandemic, hundreds of thousands from all races, ages and socioeconomic backgrounds protested alongside my organisation,National Action Network(NAN), as we led this march through the streets of Washington.‘We’re going backwards’: Black Lives Matter’s Nekima Levy Armstrong on Trump’s US and the murder of George FloydRead moreMuch has changed. In the wake of Floyd’s killing, and amid calls to respect Black lives, many corporations made commitments to continue diversifying and investing in our communities. Now we are watching many of those same companiesturn their backson their own diversity, equity and inclusion policies, capitulating to a rightwing government. The 2021 conviction of Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed Floyd, represented one of the first major cases in which someone in law enforcement was held accountable for their actions. But now some conservative groupsand individualsare pushing for Chauvin to receive a pardon from the president. Such action would be the height of throwing salt into an already achingly deep wound. It should not be entertained for a moment.Some (particularly those in power at the moment) would like to distort reality and act as though police brutality and misconduct aren’t current problems. Nothing could be further from the truth. According toMapping Police Violence, police in the US have killed 456 people so far this year (as of 23 May). In fact, there has only beena single daywhen police haven’t killed a person in 2025. And as it highlights, Black people are 2.8 times more likely to be killed by law enforcement than their white counterparts. This is why we still march, this is why we still put pressure on elected officials and corporations.For several months, NAN and I have been leading “buy-cotts” to support businesses such as Costco who remain firm in their DEI commitments. I have had meetings with PepsiCo’s chair and the CEO of PepsiCo North America, as well as Target’s CEO. Recently, I joined fellow leaders of national civil rights organisations for a meeting with top Google executives. And on 28 August, NAN will lead a march on Wall Street to defend DEI, remind corporations of their own promises in the wake of Floyd’s death, and reiterate that we will only spend our dollars where we are respected.When I stood in front of mourners five years ago at Floyd’s funeral, I said that his story has been the story of Black people, because the reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed of being is because society kept its knee on our neck. Well, just as we loudly proclaimed around the world then, we say it again, remembering George Floyd, remembering all the victims: get your knee off our necks.

Or maybe not, because this particular club was apparently founded for white men and white men only. “Millions of men are walking around on eggshells at work too scared to speak freely, while knowing that being male can now be a disaster for your career,”according to Tim Samuels, a former BBC documentary-maker turned presenter of a YouTube show called White Men Can’t Work!, which launches this week.Thefirst episodeincludes an interview with Chas Bayfield, a middle-aged advertising director whowon a sex discrimination claimover being made redundant after questioning what his female colleague’s vow to “obliterate” the firm’s white, privileged and male image meant for people like him. Work was, Bayfield explains on the show, the one thing in life he felt really good at and being let go was devastating: “My first thought was ashamed … I assumed I was bad at my job, that I’d suddenly become bad at my job, that I was not needed.”From the interview, which focuses on how men’s identities are often deeply bound up with work, it’s clear what a profound impact that injustice has had on him. What is rather less clear, however, is how one hard case becomes “millions” of men tiptoeing around the office in fear of their professional lives, suddenly realising what a disaster it is to be wearing the trousers, at a time when men still out-earn women by a measly7% on averageand the unemployment rate for black men ismore than twicethat of white men.Enter a poll specially commissioned for the show, which helpfully found that 41% of respondents were “often anxious that as a white man I can be sacked over doing or saying the wrong thing”, while 24% even felt their mental health had suffered “as a result of a diversity drive” at work.And yes, you are allowed to roll your eyes now, along with, I suspect, at least some of the 49% of white men who ticked a decisive, snorting “no” to that last question. Yet tempting as it is just to dump a giant bucket of cold water over the idea that poor white men are the official victims now and move on, something about the minority claiming real distress should set alarm bells ringing – if only about to whom exactly they’re talking and listening.It’s not just white men who spend their 50s watching anxiously over their shoulders, constantly wondering if they’re about to be replaced by someone cheaper and half their age, and how they’ll survive financially to retirement if that happens. But do enough middle-aged men have people in their lives they can confide in over what is secretly an almost universal fear? And if they don’t, who else is stoking their insecurities and channelling their indignation towards an easy target? (Noticeably, the conviction that the working world is out to get them was significantly stronger in Reform UK voters.) Do the younger white men Samuels says are feeling “very despondent about their futures” realise how many other twentysomethings feel exactly the same, and would it change anything if they did?It would be interesting to know, meanwhile, how the third of white men who worried their sons would have worse opportunities than they did feel about their daughters’ prospects. (For a good decade and a half now, polls have been consistently finding that parents of both sexes think the days of expecting your children to do better than you did are over.)The third of young white men convinced they’ve been passed over for promotion because of their identity, meanwhile, might genuinely benefit from comparing notes with the 53% of young womenwho told researchersfor the Young Women’s Trust that they think the same has happened to them. (One in three HR decision-makers sampled by the trust confessed to being aware of some form of discrimination against women in their organisations in the past year: they weren’t asked if they’d seen something similar happening to white men, but again it would be a fascinating question.)I don’t doubt that some of the anxiety Samuels identifies is real. There are enough badly managed companies around to make it plausible that some have handled diversity programmes as clumsily as they handle everything else. Working life feels tough right now, with redundancies looming and lucky breaks harder to come by, and it genuinelyismore stressful when you’re constantly having to second-guess yourself or worry about getting things right – as older women and minorities, who had to do exactly that for decades in order to fit in to male-dominated offices, of course know better than anyone.So if white men genuinely don’t think work is working for them, welcome to the club, boys. Just don’t forget that some of us have been here rather longer than you.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It relates to the future of the North West Shelf, one of the world’s largest liquified natural gas (LNG) projects.Most discussion about it assumes that it is a done deal – that the environment minister, Murray Watt, will give the green light to anapplication by Woodside Energyto extend the life of the gas export processing facility on the Burrup peninsula in Western Australia’s Pilbara region.The plant has been operating since the late 1980s and has approval to run until 2030. Woodside wants to be able to keep it going until 2070 – well beyond when Australia and the countries it sells gas to have pledged to reach net zero emissions. The extension could allow hundreds of millions more tonnes of LNG to be processed and shipped, and up to 6bn tonnes of carbon dioxide to be released once the gas is burned, a sum that qualifies as a “carbon bomb” that would help blow up the goals of the Paris climate agreement. (You can read more about the arguments relating to the development’s climate impacthere.)Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterA decision was scheduled for before the federal election. Watt’s predecessor, Tanya Plibersek, delayed it until 31 May, saying federal officials needed more time to provide their advice. The new minister had been in the environment ministerial portfolio less than a week when he indicated that the impasse was over – he planned to make an announcement by that deadline.We don’t know what led the minister to so quickly become confident that he could make an informed call. We do know that the project has been proposed for a long while, and that there has been significant pressure fromWoodside, gas and mining organisations, the WA Labor government and some news media for it to be resolved.Watt will not be directly considering the role of North West Shelf gas in driving the climate crisis as he makes his decision. A long list of people –including, 20 years ago, Anthony Albanese himself– have called for the introduction of a “climate trigger” so that atmospheric emissions would be grounds for refusing or limiting a development under national environment law. There is an obvious logic to this, given the black-and-white evidence that climate pollution is damaging the environment. But Albanese now disagrees.With climate impact largely removed from the issues Watt has to consider, the biggest factor he has to weigh is what local pollution from the plant – nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and ammonia – means for a large and globally significant collection of rock art across what is known as the Murujuga cultural landscape.Australia has backed a rapid shift to renewable energy - and given Labor a chance on climate. How will it act? | Clear AirRead moreOn this, there are outstanding questions, both on the evidence and the process.There are more than 1m petroglyphs in the area, somenearly 50,000 years oldand including the oldest known depictions of a human face. The WA government has had access to an 800-page rock art monitoring report since last year. For reasons that haven’t been explained, it chose not to release it until last Friday afternoon, in the “take out the trash” period before the weekend and just days before Watt planned to announce his decision.Asummaryofthe reportreleased by the government and the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, a body established by the WA government to represent traditional owners, suggested there was little to worry about. It said there had been damage to some rock, probably due to inflated industrial emissions from a power plant in the 1970s, but levels of key pollutants had declined since 2014, and there was no evidence that acid rain was affecting the art.Given the time constraints on Friday, this was initially reported in news media with the sort of headlines you might expect – that the report was a “boost” for the North West Shelf and “paving the way” for the extension to go ahead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What’s at stake in the battle over Australia’s North West ShelfRead moreBut those who took the time over the weekend to read the full report say this is not so clear-cut, and that there are discrepancies between what it says and the summary released to the media by the WA government.Benjamin Smith, a professor of archaeology and world rock art expert at the University ofWestern Australia, says the science behind the monitoring report is good, but the data has been badly misinterpreted.He says nobody is denying pollution degrades rock and damages ancient art. Research conducted for the monitoring report in which five different rock types were put in a weathering chamber and submitted to Murujuga-level pollution demonstrated this was the case. But the report pulls up short of declaring that pollution levels near the plant are high, and that these pollutants damage all rock types in the area.Smith says an accurate reading of tables deep within the scientific report – on page 633 – show that local pollution is now about four times worse than in the 1960s and 1970s, before the gas processing facility was built. “But somehow we’re supposed to believe that the 60s and 70s are the problem,” he says.He says this is backed up by other evidence. Researchers have rock collected near the site in 1994 that does not have the porosity – holes on the surface indicating significant damage from pollutants – that has developed over the past 30 years.Smith argues there is only one logical conclusion. “The spin around it has been wrong,” he says. “If we allow what is happening to continue we’re going to very quickly lose the rock art in Murujuga.”It means the conditions placed on an approved North West Shelf extension will be crucial. Given gas will be needed for some time yet, Smith believes it would be reasonable to allow a shorter extension that does not go beyond 2050.And he says, rather than just give the industry what it wants, Woodside should be required to power the site with renewable energy, not gas-fired electricity. It could quickly cut local pollution levels and limit the damage to rock art.With the clock ticking, he has offered to meet with Watt to discuss what he believes the data actually shows. “This is a test of political leadership,” Smith says. “A wise politician could still come out with a good outcome.”Explore more on these topicsWoodsideClear airClimate crisisAnthony AlbaneseGasEnergy (Environment)Fossil fuelsAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

As Labour announced it wouldchange tack on support for pensioners, would the government still vote to cut disabled people’s personal independence payments next month? If the economy is improving and Starmer wants to “make sure people feel those improvements”, would the upcoming child poverty plan see the two-child benefit limit finally abolished?Perhaps. As wasleaked quietly to the medialast Friday, it appears the government isn’t bumping up its flagship child poverty strategy – it’s delaying it. After 14 years of Conservative austerity and rising prices,more than one in three childrennow live in poverty in the UK – the highest level this century. Ministers are due to announce a package of up to £750m to tackle this crisis in June, but any new measures have reportedly been pushed back until at least the autumn.As one source saidof the reluctance of Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney to scrap the two-child limit: “He doesn’t think they would be getting enough political capital with voters as a result of the money they would have to put in.”Within a day, the Observer reported Starmer has privately told the cabinet that hedoesintend to end the two-child limit. The delay to the child poverty strategy, sources say, will allow the changes to be “fully costed.”It is not that such messy flip-flopping is surprising, of course, but that – coming only days after the winter fuel climbdown – any excuses for inaction are increasingly hard to swallow.These cruel benefit cuts will rob security from so many – but Labour will lose something crucial too | Frances RyanRead moreWhen Starmer rowed back on the winter fuel allowance, saying he would look again at making more pensioners eligible,he in effect pulled the curtain back in Oz. The illusion that thisLabourgovernment (and many others) rely on – that there is no money, that inequality is inevitable, that even the worst suffering cannot be eased – disappeared in a puff of smoke. If there is cash to keep pensioners warm in winter, why aren’t there ways to raise funds to do the same for children? If the winter fuel U-turn came after it was cited as a key cause of the local election defeats, are decisions actually based on the economy or electioneering?The facade first slipped a few days earlier, when it emerged thatAngela Rayner urged Rachel Reevesto consider wealth taxes before the spring statement, in a document pointedly entitled “alternative proposals for raising revenue”. This was framed by many in terms of internal tension within Labour – the chancellor on the right of the party in favour of spending cuts to the social safety net v the leftwing deputy prime minister against – but it was really about saying the quiet part out loud. Poverty is a political choice after all.If the “will he, won’t he” surrounding the two-child limit seems drawn out – and it really does – consider it in the context of Starmer’s premiership. Less than a year in office, his inner team appears almost solely focused on re-election in lieu of any vision for the country, as if the point of power is simply to keep it rather than do something with it. The result is an administration lurching from one idea to the next, trying out benefit cuts, migrant bashing, then benefit cut U-turns in the hope that something, anything, sticks.Panicked turnarounds are in many ways the natural end point of governance by spreadsheet, in which a hungry child is not someone’s daughter who needs a hot meal but a statistic on a whiteboard with the heading “GE 2029”.Reports that the child poverty taskforce has recommended bringing back Sure Start but the government is unsure how to fund it shows how this mindset puts a stranglehold on even the most obviously good ideas. That research consistently shows the early years centres – a proven success that thecoalition largely eradicated– actually saved money last time around shows the short-termism and intellectual cowardice behind the “we can’t afford it” mantra.Even the winter fuel change was largely subservience to the status quo. It has long been seen as legitimate in this country for the state to starve a child or degrade a disabled person, but a cardinal sin to take a penny from a pensioner. The same newspapers that had a hernia over the winter fuel allowance will next month cheer ontaking lifeline benefitsfrom disabled people – a move that will notably push another 50,000 children into poverty, along with their disabled and sick parents.This is not to say that many older people do not need more support – the UK state pensionis lowerthan in most other advanced economies relative to average earnings– but that there is an entire political and media ecosystem that decides which groups “deserve” help and which ones don’t. In many ways, Starmer’s biggest mistake was briefly forgetting the rules.There are moments when I wonder how exactly a Labour landslide has come to this. How a government that was elected with gutter-low expectations less than a year ago has, with such efficiency, failed to meet even them. I remember the headlines in recent years about childrensleeping on their bedroom floorbecause they don’t have a bed, orpretending to eat out of an empty lunchboxas they’re ashamed their parents can’t afford a sandwich, and I wonder how this column even needs to be written. A Labour government is in power and we are still debating whether the state should help children who are cold, hungry and dirty.In the meantime, about 100 children are beingpulled below the breadline every dayby the two-child limit alone. If the government delays the child poverty strategy for six months, an estimated 20,000 more infants will be going to bed with hunger pains by Christmas. So, we wait, as we are so used to, and hope at some point there is enough “political capital” for Starmer to feed them.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist.Who Wants Normal?

It is one of many inner London schools facing closure as a result of a 25% drop in under-fours in some boroughs, according to the most recent census. Charlotte Sharman is just around the corner from the site of the Heygate estate, which wasdemolished in 2014and replaced by Elephant Park, a development of thousands of luxury apartments, built by the Australian developer Lendlease. After the Heygate was knocked down, the school roll slumped.Elephant Park, which has won manyawards for “placemaking excellence”, is seen as an exemplar of a new global regeneration industry. In place of lower- and middle-income family housing, the new neighbourhoods are typically created to include luxury apartments set in high-security privatised public space, global retail brands, pop-ups, expensive bars and restaurants, and often a university or art gallery to provide cultural capital.Today, two-bedroom apartments in Elephant Park are on sale for between £900,000 and £1m, and of the 2,704 new homes, only 82 are for social housing. Twenty-five per cent of the new homes are designated “affordable”, but since the government changed the definition of affordable in 2010 to meanup to 80%of market rent or market value, that is financially far out of reach for the majority of Londoners and their families. Alex Mees, who works for the National Education Union and is on the picket line with the protesters, says: “They’ve got rid of family homes in the area and replaced them with one- or two-bedroom apartments – all the families are moving out, they should have seen this coming.”The regeneration of so many new districts, from King’s Cross to the Olympic Park, is part of a larger story of the extreme gentrification of cities like London where soaring house prices are leading directly to a decline in birthrates. Astudy by the Affordable Housing Commissionfound that 13% of British adults under the age of 45 and in a couple delayed or chose not to start a family because of their housing situation – with nearly 2 million people potentially affected. But the decline is much starker in cities such as London, which are experiencing the most extreme gentrification: research showed that while the capital’s overall population is rising, the numbers between the age of 25–39, the typical age of housebuying and family formation, has recentlydropped by 4%, with London Councils, the body representing the city’s 32 boroughs, attributing it to the shortage of family housing.View image in fullscreenDeal in Kent has been dubbed ‘Hackney on Sea’ thanks to the influx of millennials from London to the area.Photograph: Richard Milnes/AlamyThe knock-on effects are that across the south-east, millennials are leaving London for Bristol, Brighton and seaside towns along the south coast, such as Hastings, Eastbourne or Deal. The trend for families to leave the capital is pushing up house prices in these areas and is often far from welcome, spawning the derogatory acronym DFL (Down from London), while Deal has been branded “Hackney on Sea”.Fernanda, an architect and mother of two who lives in Hackney, described how it’s not just schools, but GP surgeries and small businesses – what she calls the “ecosystem of the city” – that are closing. “It is getting emptier and emptier and there is a clear change in demographics happening in front of our eyes,” she says, telling me that she has been invited to two farewell picnics in the next few weeks. “One family bought a house in Nottingham and another family are moving to Kent. It’s mostly people with younger kids because they’re all piled up in a small flat – my son’s class is not full.”The positive rhetoric and branding of placemaking is that it transforms run-down areas into vibrant and economically successful parts of the city. The reality is that it creates sterile places, emptied of so many of the essential aspects of urban life, except the expensive activities. The city may be emptier than ever of children and families, but tables at sought-after restaurants are still booked up weeks in advance. Another category able to stay put are older people,with the census findingthat the proportion of the population in every age group over 50 (except for 80-84 year olds) increased, as many of these people bought property in another era, unwittingly benefiting from huge rises in property values of up to 700%. Today, London boroughs like Southwark and Hackney are a mix of new half-empty neighbourhoods of luxury apartments, round the corner from streets of multimillion pound Georgian and Victorian homes that have soared in value alongside cramped and unaffordable private rental accommodation and a fast declining amount of social housing.The dictionary definition of sterile is “not able to produce children or young” and children are the canary in the coalmine for what is happening to our cities. When the city is no longer able to cater to children, or the range of other diverse uses that keep communities healthy and vibrant, places don’t die, but neither are they truly alive.Anna Minton is the author of Big Capital: Who isLondonfor?

But it won’t redeem them – or change history’s courseMon 26 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 05.38 EDTShareWhy now? That’s the question. Why now, after 19 months of relentless assault that was plain for all to see, and declared by Israeli authorities themselves, has the tide begun to shift onGaza?Themarked change in tonethis past week from leaders in theUKandEUis a clear break from the pabulum of “concerns” and reiterations of Israel’s right to defend itself. Now the rhetoric is that Israel’s actions are “morally unjustifiable” and “wholly disportionate”, and the threats of its leaders “abhorrent”. Some of this is future-proofing. The war has amounted to genocide and ethnic cleansing in ways that are increasingly undeniable, indefensible and unspinnable. Some had a good go at it for a year and a half, but now cannot stand at a lectern or sit at a dinner table and argue that, yes, actually, there is an argument forkilling 100 people a day, as was the case last week. Or that Israel has any plan other than what its leaders have consistently declared to be one of displacement and settlement. Long gone is the argument that this is simply about wiping out Hamas. Israel, as one British media allylamented, has hung its friends out to dry.But there is a disconnect between condemnation and outrage, and what happens on the ground. When it comes to Israel, the levers of international censure are broken. Throughout the war, international organisations, humanitarian missions and courts of justice have been rendered powerless by their inability to translate their findings into action. Words alone mean nothing. They simply bounce off Israel’s iron dome of impunity. Every day, the world wakes up and is confronted with an Israeli leadership that violates every law of morality and logic. Victims are aggressors,humanitarians are biased, an army that kills unarmed medics is the mostmoral army in the world. Up is down.As Gaza’s children are bombed and starved, we watch - powerless. What is it doing to us as a society? | Rhiannon Lucy CosslettRead moreThe recent change in language from Israel’s international allies is remarkable. But it would be dangerous to overestimate its significance. Israeli authorities not only do not care, but draw strength from the condemnation. It all serves to prove that the country is on its own and must persevere because it is, as ever, misunderstood, discriminated against, surrounded by enemies. The shift feels like a breakthrough only in comparison to what came before. For so long, the act of calling what is happening in Gaza by its name has been traduced, even criminalised. There are peoplesitting in detentionfor the charge of describing reality. If anything, the past year and a half has seen a series of breakthroughs that signified nothing; historic protests, a sea change in global public opinion, a tussle at the heart of western political, legal and academic institutions over the right to protest against an unfolding genocide. Palestine, once a marginal issue, has become a mainstream one that lies at the heart of western politics and discourse. And yet, as long as governments with leverage over Israel refused to act, none of that saved a single life.There is still something in this moment that could be expanded into something meaningful. Politics tends towards inertia – the observance of alliances and the status quo. To upend that requires real crisis, yet Israel has managed to escalate its campaign in Gaza to a level that has scaled even that high bar. Standing by as a population starves, watching lives ebb away in plain sight, seeing the ribs and hollowed eye sockets oflethargic children, governments are tarred with the stain of complicity. To deprive people of food, to have such power over them, is not a military campaign of strategic goals involving regrettable collateral damage – it is the creation of a ghetto of mass punishment. A defining chapter of history is being written. The sponsors of this act are clearly identifiable, emphatically supportive, and yet now seem thrown off by the position they find themselves in. Duration also plays a role. It’s all gone on for too long and it has become clear that it is impossible to force through a habituation to mass murder. But it might also be this particular phase of Israel’s campaign, which is luridly more savage and naked in its intentions than it’s ever been.If this new attitude taken by western leaders is designed to fend off a reckoning, then it’s too little, too late: the record has already been taken. If it is to deter Israel from following through on its plans of scorching the conditions for life, forcing people to leave, and starving and killing those who remain, then they are facing down a juggernaut using little more than press releases. The gulf between Israel’s actions and the world’s reaction is still too wide to be proportional. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has already insulted France, the UK and Canada, accusing their governments ofsiding with Hamasjust for finally stating the obvious: that Israel should stop killing and starving people. In what world does amember of government declarethat it intends to wipe out what remains of an area and aims, “with God’s help”, to remove its inhabitants, only for the response be nothing more than vague threats of “concrete action”? What deterrence is required to stop a doctor going to work and thenreturning to the charred remainsof nine of her 10 children, wiped out in a single blow?It will take far more than the reviewing andsuspensionof future trade talks between Israel and the UK. Those mechanisms of censure that signal displeasure and motivate outlaws to come back into the fold have been shattered by an Israel that has made a virtue out of being outside it: the kind of action required would necessitate the overturning of deeply held fears and assumptions. First, the now risiblebelief that Israel is a stabilising ally in a hostile region, that it is a country that shares civilised western values and so should be supported. Then, the fear of a rift with Israel that will violate security arrangements and historical synergies – after all, Israel has already brought that about. It has upended regional and global political and moral settlements, and its allies have still not caught up. Once these truths have been accepted, the toolkit, so easily deployed to sanction other countries, is there to be mobilised. The US remains the party with the most influence, but it is not the only player. The EU constitutesabout a thirdof Israel’s total global trade: an embargo should be sought. Sanctions should be imposed, not just on settlers but on the politicians in government who have enabled them. Theinternational criminal court’s rulingson Israeli leadership should be observed. A blockade should be enforced, one that establishes in practice the pariah status that the Israeli government has long ago earned in principle.And even then, all this would only be a start, and a colossally, tragically late one at that. One can break down why none of these things have yet happened: the hopes that keeping Israel on side preserves some modicum of leverage; concerns that strong measures will embolden Iran; loyalty to the notion of historic debt; fears of the uncertain world that a break with Israel would usher in. But that world is already here, and cowardice has only accelerated its arrival, rather than prevented its emergence.Palestinians, from Gaza to the West Bank, are paying the highest price for inaction, but an acute wound has been inflicted on the rest of the world. If nothing happens, its moral and political morbidity will encompass all.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This change mattersRichard NguyenI have seen lives transformed by the right treatments. This is not just a policy win – it’s a personal oneSun 25 May 2025 22.47 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 03.30 EDTShareOn Monday a long overdue shift in ADHD care has been announced – one that may finally bring us closer to a system that is timely, accessible and grounded in ongoing relationships between patients and their trusted family doctors.This new reform will allow specialist general practitioners, after additional training, toinitiate stimulant medication for ADHD in kids that known to themand manage ongoing treatment – without requiring direct handover from the diagnosing paediatrician or psychiatrist. In practical terms, it means that instead of acting as a powerless middleman, I’ll finally be able to do what I know is right for my patients – and much sooner.This isn’t about GPs replacing specialists. It’s about filling the gaping chasm in careCurrently, the system is buckling under the weight of long waitlists for paediatricians and psychiatrists. We’re talking 6 to 12 months – if the referral is even accepted – to access a diagnosis, let alone treatment. In that time, people fall through the cracks.Children continue to struggle in classrooms where they are mislabeled as defiant rather than distracted; adults silently carry the burden of emotional dysregulation, disorganisation and burnout. Families suffer. Relationships unravel. Careers stall. And for what? Because we’ve artificially limited access to care and underestimated the ability ofGPsto manage what is, in many cases, a chronic neurodevelopmental condition with clear diagnostic criteria and well-established treatment pathways.As a GP, I see these patients daily. I know their histories. I know their families. And more often than not, I know exactly what a psychiatrist or paediatrician will say – but I’ve had to tell patients, “I know what needs to happen next, but I can’t legally do it.” That changes now.GPs to diagnose ADHD and prescribe drugs for children and adults under NSW reformsRead moreThis isn’t about GPs replacing specialists. It’s about filling the gaping chasm in care that exists between a diagnosis and effective treatment. It’s about recognising that in a stretched and fragmented system, GPs with the right training are best positioned to deliver timely and safe care, especially for conditions like ADHD.But beyond my professional perspective, this reform touches something deeper for me. I was diagnosed with ADHD before the Covid-19 pandemic – well before the surge in public awareness and the influx of people seeking assessment in recent years. It was a long overdue recognition of a lifelong pattern.I am also a parent of children with ADHD. I know the chaos of untreated symptoms and I know the clarity and calm that can follow the right treatment. I’ve seen lives transform – my own, my family’s, my patients’.This is not just a policy win; it’s a personal one.Some critics have suggested we are facing an epidemic of overdiagnosis. I disagree. What we are seeing is a long-needed correction – a better understanding of ADHD across the lifespan and among groups historically underdiagnosed. This isn’t a fad. It’s a reckoning with reality.Critics may question whether GPs are “qualified enough” to manage stimulant medications. To that I say: we already manage far more dangerous drugs in complex scenarios – opioids, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics. We monitor, we adjust, we counsel. With appropriate guidelines and training, ADHD management is well within our wheelhouse.This reform is about trust. Trust in patients to know when they need help. Trust in GPs to rise to the challenge with care and competence. And trust in a healthcare system that must evolve to meet growing demand with practical, people-centred solutions.For every child who has waited too long, for every adult who has been misdiagnosed, misunderstood, or turned away, this change matters. For every GP who has felt helpless watching a patient deteriorate while stuck on a waitlist – this change matters. For families like mine, this is not an abstract policy. This is hope, made real.We must get the implementation right. Training must be robust, support must be ongoing and collaboration with specialists must be preserved where complexity demands it. But let’s be clear: this is a gamechanger. And it’s about time.Dr Richard Nguyen is a GP in southern SydneyExplore more on these topicsHealthOpinionAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderGPsDoctorscommentShareReuse this content"

Why text messages are the hot new boom area in TV showsWhat makes for a believable texting – or sexting – exchange? And why has this suddenly become so crucial for a character’s credibility? We meet the teams who agonise over writing lines that only appear on screen for secondsAmelia TaitMon 26 May 2025 10.49 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 11.49 EDTShareIn the final episode of Ted Lasso’s second season, Ted sends a text to his ex-wife that reads simply: “Knock, knock.” Nothing too unusual about that you might think, but whatisstrange is that it appears to be the very first message he’s ever sent the mother of his son. Stranger still, she has never previously texted him either. The blank white space above and below their messages reveals that the characters share zero messaging history.It’s a problem that used to plague TV. Why is the first message Emily in Paris has ever received from her boyfriend: “Hey, how is Paris?” When Rebecca accidentally sends a text to her crush instead of her best friend in Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, why is their history blank when we saw him text her about a housewarming party a few episodes earlier? In 2021, Wired journalist Zak Jason nameda whole litany of showsin which characters don’t have text histories – New Girl, Insecure, The Undoing – and argued that it was, “inexcusable, and unnerving to witness”.It appears that studios and streamers alike were listening. Because nowadays, television writers put a huge amount of thought into getting a character’s text history right – even if it is only going to appear on screen for a matter of seconds.We met with the writers, directors and showrunners to figure out what Ted Lasso would have said to his doctor three months agoIn the currently airing dark comedyYour Friends & Neighbours, everyone texts regularly. When Jon Hamm’s character Coop wants to meet up with his lover, we see a long history of past booty calls and even the bottom of a sexy snap. When his son texts his crush, it’s apparent that she previously responded to something with the letter “k”. Meanwhile, recently released thriller seriesThe Stolen Girlfeatures emoji-filled logs between spouses and colleagues: “Grabbing lunch. Want anything?”, “I’m WFH today btw.” And Ted Lasso course-corrected in season three,showing viewersTed’s historic interactions with swathes of people, including a message to his upstairs neighbour: “I swear to you, I’m not playing music.”View image in fullscreen‘I swear to you Mrs Shipley, I’m not playing music’ … Ted Lasso’s much-changed phone in season three.Photograph: Amelia Tait“It drives all of us crazy when there aren’t text histories – it’s something we’ve fought for years,” says Dave Henri, a managing partner of California-based graphic design firm Modern Motion, which he co-founded in 2009. The company developedMagic Phone, a piece of software that can be installed on prop devices on set. The app is paired with a Bluetooth keyboard that allows crew to trigger notifications, or the bubbles that appear when someone is typing, so an actor can tap out any old gibberish and still prompt the right message to appear on screen in real time. Magic Phone also enables productions to add text message histories with plausible time-stamps, and thanks to the realism of the software, it has been used by numerous Apple TV+ productions including The Morning Show, Shrinking and Ted Lasso.TV fans today are taking screen grabs, posting them on Reddit and dissecting everything“I think the studios and creatives have embraced the fact that we are so used to seeing these devices that, if it doesn’t look right, the audience bumps against that,” says Modern Motion co-founder Chris Cundey. Or as Henri puts it: “A lot of thought goes into it now because people are aware that fans are taking screen grabs, posting them on Reddit anddissecting everything.”Modern Motion employee Rob Rogers worked on Ted’s elaborate text history in season three; he says the graphics went through 25 to 30 iterations before they got it right. “We met with the writers, directors and all the showrunners to figure out what Ted would have said to his mum, or what he would’ve said to the doctor three months ago,” Rogers says. Some graphics were even altered after the show premiered, to improve them for people streaming later on. “If they realised a message couldn’t have been sent at 10:53am for whatever reason, they wanted to fix it to make it perfect.”View image in fullscreenScroll queen … Ambika Mod in The Stolen Girl.Photograph: Matt Squire/DisneyA surprising amount of work goes into something that is on screen for just a brief moment. “On just run-of-the-mill text messages, we would have 13 or 14 iterations. That comes down to thinking about what a character is named in a person’s phone, what their contact image is, or whether they know each other well enough to have an image,” says Rogers. In one throwaway gag for eagle-eyed viewers, we see that Ted’s mum has previously texted him to say that her internet is down, before attaching a picture of an unplugged router. “We had like three or four different photos that they provided of that router – that’s how deep we go.”While it’s fun to add Easter eggs like this, past texts can’t be too distracting because then audiences will miss the “hero text” that is being sent or received as part of the plot. Script editor Charlie Niel battled with this on The Stolen Girl. While texts that were important for the storyline were written into the script by the head writers, he filled in the message histories, which were then signed off by the writers and producers. “The crucial, crucial thing is not pulling focus,” he says. Past texts can’t be “outlandish, attention-grabbing or long” because viewers’ eyes will drift up. “On the other hand, it’s a tricky balance because I also find it distracting if the messages are too generic; if they’re how no one ever speaks.”Niel looked to his own real-life texts for inspiration. “I would think, ‘What do I text my colleagues about?’ And it’s stuff like, ‘I’m going out for coffee, do you want one?’” Sometimes he would throw in a typo to make things realistic. But he also had to be careful not to include anything that would inadvertently affect the story or change the way we see the characters. Continuity was king – if a character gets a text on one day, it needs to be visible in their history the next day – sometimes with a few random other messages in between.View image in fullscreenA booty call in Your Friends & Neighbours.Photograph: Amelia TaitIn the end, Niel wrote between 10 and 20 historic texts for each interaction, for only one or two of them to ultimately end up on screen. At one point in The Stolen Girl, a character scrolls through the DMs sent to a media outlet’s social media account and Niel had to “adopt the voice of an internet troll” to write these messages. He also had to come up with the senders’ names. Because every name that appears on screen has to besigned offby the legal department – so that, for example, a journalist named Amelia Tait couldn’t sue if a journalist named Amelia Tait were featured – Niel christened some of the trolls after fellow crew members.In the end, text message histories won’t make or break a show, but they are often appreciated by audiences. “Because TV viewers are so sophisticated now, they’ll notice if one little text that we say happened on 26 April contradicts something else in the script,” Niel says. Actors, too, often enjoy playing around on their phoney devices. “Making it easy for the actors, and seeing their reaction to it, is really one of the best things,” Henri says. Apparently Harrison Ford was a fan of Magic Phone on the Shrinking set. And Cundey notes that even actors who “hunt and peck with just two fingers” while typing can look like master hackers thanks to the software.Nowadays, if characters’ text histories are missing, viewers can be a little more confident that it just might be on purpose. “When a typing bubble appears and goes away and appears and goes away and nothing comes, that’s a modern metaphor for something unresolved,” Cundey notes – texts can communicate so much with so little. And the crew behind these messages are happy that their work is starting to get noticed. “We are an often misunderstood or passed over vocation of the industry,” says Rogers. “But we’re also ever-growing.” Or to put it another way: ppl don’t say omg atm, but iykyk.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTelevision industryEmily in ParisMobile phonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So a researcher in the Gaelic department came up with Balamory’Interviews byRich PelleyMon 26 May 2025 10.08 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 16.55 EDTShareBrian Jameson, creatorAfter graduating from Rada I’d been a jobbing actor for 20 years. One day I was with my kids watchingPlay School, and thought: “I could be a presenter on this.” So I became one, and then the BBC trained me up as a preschool director and I went on to be a freelance director and producer specialising in preschool.The BBC wanted to do a preschool drama centred around travellers in Ireland. It didn’t get commissioned but it gave me the idea to create something set in a community. I had a health hiccup, which put me out of work but gave me downtime to think. Play School had been a new programme every day, so it had an immediacy. I thought: “Why not make a preschool soap?”A year later, BBC had createdCBeebiesand had masses of airtime to fill and were looking for a programme that was about the world around us, so I pitched my idea. The commissioning editor said: “How can you do a soap for preschool kids?” I said: “Well, instead of the Queen Vic you could have a nursery school.” He said: “That’s quite a good idea.” I was made series producer and we had to film 126 episodes in 10 months, beginning in January 2002.I went down to the EastEnders set. They were very helpful and I came back with a formula. We were originally going to film in Kirkcudbright but that was too far from Glasgow, where we needed to film some of the indoor shots, so we moved it to Tobermory on the Isle of Mull, which is a child’s dream with all its colours, water and hills. I’d already written the theme song: What’s the Story in Tobermory? But there was a Womble calledTobermory, so a researcher in the Gaelic department came up with Balamory. It wasn’t a nod to Oasis’s (What’s the Story?) Morning Glory, which I’d never heard of!We put out feelers for the cast, such as “a child’s dream nursery teacher” for Miss Hoolie. Lionel Jefferies, who’d played the grandfather in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, applied, but we weren’t really looking for named actors, plus – it’s terrible to say – I think I was too terrified to audition him in case I had to say no. Mary Riggans, who’d been in Scottish soap opera Take the High Road, wowed us, and we cast her as Suzie Sweet. We constructed our own school in Barmulloch, in the north of Glasgow. The kids would come in and believe it was their nursery, so they didn’t have to act.Kids programmes aren’t just for children. They’re meant to be a shared experience. The characters we created all had their quirks. There was friction between [school bus driver] Edie McCredie and Suzie Sweet [who runs the village shop and cafe]. Miss Hoolie [nursery teacher] and PC Plum quite liked each other. I think the quirks made them seem more relatable. We created a community on this little island that felt realistic and had humour no matter what age you are. I think that’s probably why people are so fond of the characters and the place.I’m not involved in thereboot, at least, not yet.Kim Tserkezie, played Penny PocketI was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy at the age of two. It was amazing how many people thought my wheelchair was a prop. A small role in ITV drama Blind Ambition that centred on disabled athletes gave me the itch to act, although being disabled often means playing a character who specifically has a disability issue or medical problem. Eventually I found myself in a room with Brian Jameson and lots of other actors who were all being considered for the role of Penny. My disability was never openly discussed in front of me, which is what made the role so very important to me.Penny runs the village shop and cafe with Suzie Sweet. She’s a bit of a maths wizard and likes organising. As the writers got to know me and realise how active I was, Penny went on to be the football and rowing coach. I spent the best part of three years filming up inScotland, doing 14-hour days but having the best of times.Working on Balamory was such joy. I was surrounded by such a brilliant cast and crew. We laughed a lot! The scripts were funny but also sometimes surreal, like one about a party at the nursery when Penny and Suzie were dressed as Pearly Queens but nobody else was in costume. It was also emotional – I particularly remember the episode when Penny and Suzie went to Finland to visit Santa. I got to meet him and cuddle a litter of husky puppies – there were sobs!The Balamory fandom quickly grew. We were able to meet many of them when we performed live on the arena tours. It all felt a bit rock’n’roll. I remember Sophie Ellis-Bextor coming to the show and saying she loved Penny’srap song. For the first time my son started to think I was cool. I started to realise how popular the show had become when I went to St James’ Park to watch Newcastle United play and the fans, in their thousands, all sang What’s the Story? when they saw me. It gave me goosebumps, and still does, thinking about it.Explore more on these topicsChildren's TVHow we madeCBeebiesScotlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now with a new album, and an unlikely boost from Black Mirror, the 84-year-old ‘Soul Queen of New Orleans’ is hitting new heightsMon 26 May 2025 06.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 26 May 2025 06.31 EDTShareIrma Thomas greets me at the front door of the ranch house she shares with her husband and manager Emile Jackson. For a singer celebrated as the “Soul Queen of New Orleans”, I’m somewhat surprised her home isn’t more, well, palatial. Graceland this isn’t.Although Thomas, 84, has enjoyed hit records, Grammy awards, international tours, critical praise and the loyal devotion of her home city, she has never experienced the largesse that comes with sustained stardom. Instead, she has her health, a 50-year marriage, great-grandchildren and a stunning new album, Audience With the Queen, created with Galactic, the esteemed New Orleans electro-funkers.Thomas is one of the last of the best, an African American soul singer who, forged by gospel, overcame discrimination and a brutal music industry to achieve enduring greatness. She scored herfirst hitaged 18 in 1959 but never enjoyed the huge success of her contemporaries Aretha Franklin and Gladys Knight. No matter: everyone from the Rolling Stones to Otis Redding and Beverley Knight has sung her songs (and praises). Bonnie Raitt, now a close friend, says of Thomas, “She’s a legend. She’s as good today as she was the day she came out of the church singing.”View image in fullscreenTime on her side … Irma Thomas in 1965.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesI mention to Thomas the praise that now trails her and she cocks an eyebrow and says: “I guess it’s nice people say such things while I’m still here.” Irma, I’m learning, isn’t one for blandishments. That said, when I tell her Audience With the Queen is a stunning return after a 17-year absence she agrees. “The guys in Galactic had been talking about doing an album with me for a while,” Thomas recalls, as we settle in a living room decorated with her many awards. “I had to say: ‘Listen, I am not getting any younger – let’s do this!’ And, to their credit, they made a really good job of it.”Indeed they did; Audience With the Queen blends electronic arrangements with Thomas’s gospel-steeped vocal to create yet another feather in her crown. “I’m finally getting my flowers. About time too.”Born Irma Lee in Ponchatoula, Louisiana, in 1941, she and her family shifted to New Orleans when she was an infant. “I grew up in the city but, between age four and nine, I lived with my relatives, real country people. I used to help pick strawberries on my uncle’s farm; I ate as many as I picked! That kind of upbringing has held me in good stead over the years.”Getting pregnant aged 14 curtailed Thomas’s education and a shotgun marriage to her child’s father quickly collapsed. Aged 15 she was a solo mother who worked as dishwasher. By the age of 18 she had remarried, given birth to two more children and become a waitress at the Pimlico club where Tommy Ridgely, a band leader who helped shape the city’s R&B sound, held a residency. Thomas, never lacking in confidence, told Ridgely she was a better singer than his band’s vocalist. He invited Thomas on stage to prove herself and she seized the opportunity. While the club’s patrons applauded her, Thomas was fired for neglecting her job.I resented that audiences would request I ‘\"sing the Stones song\". Well, no thank you. So I stopped singing it.Sensing greatness, Ridgley took her to Joe Ruffino at Ron Records. There she recorded the storming R&B tune Don’t Mess With My Man, written by Dorothy LaBostrie, who had co-written Tutti Frutti for Little Richard. “I’d gone from a dishwasher earning 50 cents a night, to a waitress on $5 a night, so when I was offered $50 a night to be a singer, I signed on!”Fronting Ridgley’s band, Thomas worked one-nighters across the south and the eastern seaboard, playing the chitlin’ circuit (the name given to a loose network of Black-owned clubs) and white college fraternity parties. It was a hard grind, made more difficult by segregation’s privations and raucous audiences: one night a drunken student accidentally kicked Thomas’s microphone, knocking out her front teeth.“Segregation meant there were often no hotels we could stay in, so we’d drive four or five hours back to New Orleans,” she says. “Restaurants wouldn’t serve us, so we lived on sardines and crackers. That’s the way things were.”Thomas isn’t one to moan. Instead she speaks directly, refusing to suffer fools or tolerate dishonesty. Unhappy with her royalty payments, Thomas refused to continue recording for Ruffino. She would begin a working relationship with the famed pianist, songwriter and producer Allen Toussaint, and go on to sign for Imperial Records in Los Angeles, where she began recording with a crack team of session musicians and arrangers now celebrated collectively as the “Wrecking Crew”. Her magnificent run of 45s included I Wish Somebody Would Care, a song Thomas wrote, which became her biggest US hit.View image in fullscreenFunky town … Irma Thomas with fellow New Orleans musicians Galactic.Photograph: Katie Sikora“I wrote that because my then husband really resented me pursuing my career as a singer and made things extremely difficult. I was on the verge of doing something that would have sent me to prison … instead, I left him.” She continued to pursue her career thanks in part to “loving parents who did a lot of babysitting and a network of supportive women. Having children kept me grounded; I couldn’t go out to party or take drugs because I had to get home to my kids.”In 1964, she recorded Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand), a song co-written by the young Randy Newman. Its one of Thomas’s most striking vocal performances, her mournful voice conveying an eerie beauty, yet it struggled to No 52 on the US Top 100. The British Invasion of the American charts was under way, with US pop radio now championing Anglo bands, many of whom were singing songs by Black American artists, rather than the originals. A case in point being when the Rolling Stones covered Time Is on My Side, the B-side of Anyone Who Knows What Love Is, only weeks after Thomas’s version was released. The Stones’ version is effective, although Jagger copied Irma’s vocal, ad-libs and all, in its entirety – a pale imitation.“I didn’t mind the Stones recording the song,” says Thomas, “what I did resent was when audiences would request I ‘sing the Stones song’. Well, no thank you. So I stopped singing it.”A subsequent UK tour in 1966 was badly organised and saw Thomas lose 15lbs and her voice for three months. “I had no one looking after things for me and found myself singing night after night – and some matinees – for around three weeks. I had a very basic British backing band and went everywhere in an old van. It was exhausting and debilitating. I was told by a voice doctor that if I ever wanted to sing again I couldn’t speak for three months. So I didn’t. Which was really difficult, especially when you have small children.”View image in fullscreenSoul survivor … Irma Thomas in 1970.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesThe 60s weren’t swinging for Thomas. Instead her career went into freefall: dropped by Liberty Records, she forlornly sought work as a backing vocalist on LA recording sessions. Thomas settled in Oakland, California, got a job in a department store, singing only on weekends. “Singing is my vocation,” Thomas says, “but I was a mom first and needed to create a stable environment for my kids. And seeing them get an education encouraged me to go to night school. Later on I got a business diploma, which helped me negotiate contracts.” While she recorded for Chess and Atlantic Records, as well as working with maverick soul songwriter-producer Jerry “Swamp Dogg” Williams Jr, her career was constantly sabotaged by music industry machinations. “Music’s a tough industry,” she says, “especially if you won’t sign whatever they put in front of you. I didn’t want people to own me, so they called me ‘difficult’. Well, maybe I am. Better that than being taken advantage of.”By the mid-70s, Thomas determined that New Orleans at least still appreciated its Soul Queen. Returning home led to marrying Emile Jackson – “third time lucky”, she says of the man who is still her husband today – and getting plenty of work. Her career rebirth began in 1983 when UK label Ace issued Time Is on My Side, a compilation of her 1961-64 singles. The album sold strongly and introduced Thomas to a new generation – British northern soul fans started to seek out the Lion’s Den, a club she and Emile ran – while Jim Jarmusch chose Thomas’s It’s Raining to soundtrack Roberto Benigni and Nicoletta Braschi’s affecting waltz in Down By Law. Then Scott Billington of Rounder Records, a Massachusettslabel dedicated to American folk/roots music, approached Thomas about recording new material. From 1986 to 2008, Billington produced 10 albums that re-established Thomas as one of America’s finest contemporary vocalists, and saved her from what she describes as “a life singing It’s Raining every night in a hotel bar”.Almost 20 years ago, Hurricane Katrina decimated much of New Orleans. Thomas and her husband were out of town when the hurricane hit, flooding their home and ruining the Lion’s Den. Recorded mere months after Katrina, Thomas’s 2006 album After the Rain won a Grammy. But, after 2008’s majestic Simply Grand album, she again found herself without a record label, while the collapse of CD sales meant the music industry again declined to back a singer who was written off as “old school”.“I don’t feel bitter about things,” says Thomas. “I’m established, and I only sing when I want for the fee that Emile insists is right. If no one wanted a new Irma Thomas album so be it.”View image in fullscreenSatisfaction guaranteed … Irma Thomas performing with the Rolling Stones at the 2024 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage festival.Photograph: Erika Goldring/Getty ImagesGalactic, who command a wide US audience, determined the worlddidwant a new Irma Thomas album. “I’m used to recording with musicians in the studio,” notes Thomas, “while Galactic programme the beats and music then got me in to sing. A strange experience for me, but it worked. I never previously considered myself a protest singer but, things being the way they are, means I got to voice my displeasure.”Thomas is talking about Lady Liberty, a song where she sings: “How long can history repeat itself, Lord we need some help / Time to shuffle these cards that we’ve been dealt and free ourselves.” Lady Liberty, I suggest, nails Trump’s America. “I don’t even want to say his name,” she replies, her voice indignant. “I grew up with segregation and now he and his people are trying to turn back time and ruin everything good about this nation. I am furious.” The “flowers” she mentioned have been blooming in recent years: Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand) became a recurring motif in Black Mirror, giving Thomas 90m streams and sparking interest in her back catalogue. “The first thing I knew about it was when I got a phone call saying: ‘Irma, there’s a big cheque coming your way.’ I ain’t never heard of Black Mirror but I’m sure glad it exists.” There have been two documentaries about her life and an authorised biography will be published next year.Then at New Orleans’ Jazzfest 2024 festival, headliners the Rolling Stones invited Thomas to join them on stage to perform Time Is on My Side. Watching the veteran Brits and the Soul Queen of New Orleans unite is a treat – Jagger tells the audience that the song they’re about to perform was first sung by Thomas in 1964, then they trade off verses with aplomb. Were you happy as you look when singing with the Stones, I ask her.“I was,” she says. “Because Mick told the crowd that I did it first and they learned it from me. He gave me respect. That’s all I ask for. I’ve been through a lot since 1964, so it felt good to get that kind of acknowledgment in front of their audience. Real good.”My audience with the queen is up: Thomas wants to have lunch with Emile, read the Bible, watch a gameshow and prepare for headlining the French Quarter festival the next day, performing with a voice that Raitt says is still as “beautiful, sultry and powerful as it was on her first records”.

In this extract from his new book,Ryan Gilbeytakes a fresh look at the ‘queerbaiting’ conundrumRyan GilbeyMon 26 May 2025 00.00 EDTShareJustin Kelly and I first met in 2008 when I was sent to Los Angeles to interview Gus Van Sant. I breezed into the screening room where Van Sant was viewing a rough cut of his film Milk, and promptly tripped over the film-maker’s Australian shepherd Milo, who was snoozing in the dark. Kelly was minding the dog that morning, so in some small but unshakable way I will always blame him for my spectacular stumble.Kelly was the editorial assistant on Milk, which starred Sean Penn asthe assassinated San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, and James Franco as his lover. Kelly then went on to direct Franco on two occasions as gay characters based on real people: activist Michael Glatze, who renounces his former life after finding religion inI Am Michael; and the escort, porn producer and convicted murderer Joe Kerekes inKing Cobra. Consequently, Kelly has had a ringside seat for the whole “queerbait” argument over whether straight or apparently straight actors should play LGBTQ+ roles.Imagine ScarJo at the Oscars for playing a trans gangster – that would’ve been major“I never saw James’s performances as him ‘pretending’ to be gay,” he tells me from among the jaunty cushions in his mother’s guest bedroom in Prescott, Arizona, where he has stopped off during a road trip. “I just saw him as being interested in playing all kinds of characters. He knew he could help these cool queer movies get made and give someone like me a chance to direct. When we were doing press, journalists would throw him some shade, and I’d be like, ‘He’s bringing these incredible queer stories to the screen, so what’s the problem?’”View image in fullscreen‘This is what we’ve been asking for’… film-maker Justin KellyPhotograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty ImagesThe term “queerbaiting” wasn’t in circulation when I Am Michaelopened in 2015. “Once it started floating around, I became very irritated by it,” Kelly says. “I think it’s fucking bullshit. Since before Stonewall, gay people have been asking the straight world to accept us and not treat us differently. And now we finally have these huge names – actors, musicians – telling the world that not only should you not be homophobic but that maybe it’s fucking cool to be gay … and people aremad? I’m like, ‘What is wrong with you?’” He is laughing and spluttering. “That’s what we’ve been asking for all this time!”Such complaints may be guided partly by the misapprehension that work is being snatched away from LGBTQ+ talent. “Dare I veer into a controversial example?” asks Kelly. “Scarlett Johansson was going to play a trans character, then people raised hell, so she dropped out.” He is referring to the still unmade Rub & Tug, for which Johansson was cast as the real-life trans male gangster Dante “Tex” Gill, beforeshe stepped down from the filmin 2018. “It would have been a great story to get out there. Who knows how many people it would have inspired? But it fell apart. And now that movie is gone. I think queer people should feel bummed about that. I mean, imagine ScarJo at the Oscars for playing a trans man: that would’ve been major. The important thing to remember is – guess what? – famous actors get indie queer films financed. And we need visibility.”After twice working with Franco, who spent more than a decadeteasing the world that he might be gay, Kelly directed Kristen Stewart in JT LeRoy, about a notorious real-life literary hoax. Until Stewart came along – and came out – no other modern performer of comparable calibre and status had expressed queer sexuality so emphatically through their choices of roles. In JT LeRoy, she stars asSavannah Knoop, a non-binary artist who agreed to pose as the (male) author of a brace of queer novels that were in fact the work of Knoop’s older sister-in-law.View image in fullscreenPulled out … Scarlett Johansson, left, and the trans gangster Dante ‘Tex’ Gill, whom she was going to play.Composite: AFP/Getty Images/ Pittsburgh Post-Gazette via APStewart has also been revelatory as a diffident night-school teacher pined over by a timid student in Kelly Reichardt’sCertain Women, and as a queer, steroid-pushing gym boss in Rose Glass’s lurid B-movie-style rompLove Lies Bleeding. Much of the frisson in her two films with Olivier Assayas – Clouds of Sils Maria and Personal Shopper – derives from the effect of her being not quite tangible, or just out of reach. In both, Stewart is a peripheral or ephemeral figure: a curious position for one of the world’s most photographed faces. Personal Shopper, JT LeRoy and Spencer, in which she plays Princess Diana,all provide Stewart with fastidious scenes of dressing and undressing that hint at the divestiture or cultivation of layers, defences and secrets. The sense is that the actor is exposing some unseen inner dimension, expressing her own queerness through a series of masks.Kristen brought her girlfriend to our meeting and I thought: ‘Ooh, I know she’s gay and no one else does’Attaching Stewart to JT LeRoy was nothing short of a coup. She came out publicly on Saturday Night Live in 2017, being greeted with cheers after describing herself as “like, so gay”. Kelly had met her a few years earlier to discuss the script, which he and Knoop adapted from Knoop’s book Girl Boy Girl: How I Became JT LeRoy. “Kristen made it clear that she’d brought her girlfriend with her,” he says, “and I remember thinking, ‘Ooh, I know she’s gay and no one else does!’”It took several years to secure financing. So why did Stewart hang on? “She was very connected to the material. I brought it up one time when we were shooting in Winnipeg. We would go to this small-town gay bar where everyone would stare and send over drinks. I told Kristen, ‘Part of me was wondering if you were gonna get 5,000 other great offers and bail.’ And she said, ‘I would have done this movie at any point. I was afraid it might never happen because it’s such a cool story that it could have been too cool for people to put money into, or to understand.’”View image in fullscreenConcealed identities … Kristen Stewart with Laura Dern in Kelly’s film JT LeRoy.Photograph: Buffalo Gal Pictures/AllstarThe timing couldn’t have been better. “Since she wasn’t officially out when she signed up, she jumped at the opportunity to play Sav, who was not just a lesbian but a queer woman who now identifies as non-binary – but at that time did not. There are already non-binary aspects to the character in the movie, though, in all the going back-and-forth between being a boy and a girl.”Stewart worked closely with Knoop. “Kristen and Sav really hit it off. Sav’s a true artist: their whole style, their clothing. They wear the weirdest shit, it’s fucking incredible. Kristen was so into them as a person. One of the things she brought, I think, came from not being out at that point. Sav, the character, was pretending to be JT while also in the closet about being potentially trans and potentially non-binary, and not knowing how to put that out into the world. And Kristen was going through a similar thing: at that level of fame, you’re potentially gonna get attacked or ostracised for coming out. That idea of hiding part of one’s identity was something she wove into the character so beautifully in these very quiet ways. You can see in a lot of her roles that she’s dealing with identity. As Princess Diana, she’s trying to figure out who she is as someone who doesn’t want to be that famous.”Her performance in Love Lies Bleeding, though, is the one that Kelly maintains is the closest to theKristen Stewarthe knows. “In JT LeRoy, she was playing someone so different from herself, even though there was that connection of both having a secret. Whereas I saw more of Kristen in Love Lies Bleeding, more of the real person in terms of being a badass bitch. I think it was a chance for her to do so many things she’s always wanted to do. To play a version of herself and to be super-fucking-gay. To have those sex scenes, the stuff about fingering, the ‘I wanna spread you’ line, licking the protein shake that spills on her girlfriend’s body, taking men down. All things that I believe she was dying to put out there.”View image in fullscreenLurid romp … Kristen Stewart with Katy O’Brian in Love Lies Bleeding.Photograph: Anna KoorisLooked at from this distance, I Am Michael and JT LeRoy play like cracked mirror images of each other. Both are inspired by real-life identity crises and capitalise on the actors’ off-screen baggage. Just as Stewart’s experience of being in the spotlight while hiding parts of herself informed JT LeRoy, so Franco’s teasing about his own sexuality enhanced I Am Michael, a film that hinges on the sincerity or otherwise of his character’s conversion. A formerly gay man trying to convince the world he is now straight was being played by a straight actor who had long hinted that he might be gay.“I don’t think I was conscious of it at the time,” says Kelly. “But now you bring it up, it probably did help. We’re watching this guy question his sexuality. It might also have helped him play the character as well. I don’t know whether James is gay or not.” He smiles. “I mean, everyone’s a little bit gay, so …”This is an edited extract from It Used to Be Witches: Under the Spell of Queer Cinema by Ryan Gilbey, published on 5 June by Faber.

Luckily Avalon was that producer, “brave enough to go with probably the smallest title treatment in the West End”. Against a sea of jaunty, hazard-warning yellow, the poster features an energetic black scribble in the top right while the title is small and tight in the middle. Look again and you’re staring at a sketch of Hitler’s fringe and moustache. The name of the show is neatly topped by a handle, signalling the stealth attache case that propels the Nazi-duping plot.A theatreland legend, King has form in creating brands that can travel and endure. Mincemeat is just his latest poster to hit Broadway. He had fun, he admits, with this musical of spies and stratagems, which isup for four Tony awards in June. “We did it in lockdown, and went through lots of scribbles. I’m old school – I always start with scribbling it out in my book, notepad or the back of a fag packet. My designers can make it look fabulous, but unless you’ve got that first idea, the computer won’t solve it for you.”Daniel Radcliffe was up for it, and the shoot was quite somethingMincemeat fell foul of Transport for London’s anti-graffiti caution (although its initial ban was overturned). “They said the hair looked as if it had been put on with a marker – which it had of course!” Same with the apparently scribbled updating of the show’s five-star reviews. TfL’s advertising policy declares that graffiti-styled ads “encourage wider acts of vandalism”. King protests: “You’re sending them a piece of art, and it’s censored. Everything becomes bland. There’s no punch, no guts.”View image in fullscreen‘Unless you’ve got that first idea, the computer won’t solve it for you’ … KingWith his duck-and-dive energy, King has become one of theatre’s defining figures, receiving an Olivier special recognition award in 2022. “I always had an eye,” he admits. A scribbler from childhood, he didn’t enjoy college, so joined a print shop in Covent Garden. Next came a government gig in Woolwich. “Everyone was in a suit and tie and I was wearing dungarees and a perm. I couldn’t stand it, it wasn’t rock’n’roll.”He ended up at ad agency Dewynters (his interview test was a black and white illustration of Paul Scofield) in the 1980s. “Bonkers times,” he says. “We had a lot of fun.” Anthony Pye-Jeary, the co-founder, was always accompanied by his dog Boston, at least until theatre o’clock. “He’d put Boston in the back of a taxi and send him home.” Robert Dewynter himself, AKA the Major, was old-school louche: “Pinstripe suit. Cigarette holder. Proper eccentric. For his 40th birthday they got an armoured car, like a tank, to turn up in Dover Street and drive him down for lunch at the Savoy.”View image in fullscreenGlobetrotting brand … The Phantom of the Opera.Photograph: Bob King CreativeKing’s indelible images are inextricable from the shows they promote. His career began alongside the mega-musicals that needed a brand to fit globetrotting productions. He and Dewynters’ creative director Russ Eglin created the white carnival mask and red rose that forever herald Phantom of the Opera. “It was pre-computer, so everything was hand-painted. Russ sketched out the mask and I airbrushed it. For the lettering I used Letraset – cut it up like a shattered piece of glass, and then airbrushed it to give the feeling of glass. The technology has developed, but the mask and title remain.”Daniel Radcliffe escaped the shackles of Harry Potter by appearing in Peter Shaffer’s Equus in 2007: an audacious rebrand enhanced by a nude poster image. “He was up for it, and the shoot was quite something,” says King. “We had this horse in a studio in north London – the trainer just touched his neck and he lay down.” As the Gielgud theatre was being renovated, the resulting image covered the scaffolding: “it looked like we owned the building.”Some posters trumpet their stars, others bravely withhold them. Imelda Staunton led last year’s Hello, Dolly! but her irrepressible glint was absent from the graphics-only poster. “It always used to be that the show was bigger than the star,” King says. “In latter years, there’s so much riding on a production that producers are nervous. We may start with a logo, a look. But that may well develop when the stars become available – it’s often very last minute.” The first poster for Robert Icke’s much lauded Oedipus didn’t initially show Lesley Manville and Mark Strong; they appeared in later incarnations.View image in fullscreenMore of King’s designs.Composite: Bob King CreativeFramed posters surround us in King’s London office, from hits to no-hopers (“Sometimes it’s been a case of: nice poster, shame about the show”). He set up his own company in 2015, and having his name above the door comes with a sense of worth. He’d always planned to retire at 50, but thought, “I don’t want to live my life not knowing what could have been. I started it on a couple of grand, moved in, had one phone line and a mobile.” His company’s first job was a school’s version of School of Rock. “The phone rang in the first half an hour.” Since then, he says, it hasn’t stopped.“Every job has a problem that needs solving,” he adds, relishing the challenge of adding graphic audacity to theatreland. “You’re creating a tease. I would never try to tell the whole story – the magic has to be on stage.” Selling your audacious idea is another matter. “Blood, sweat and tears have gone into each one of these visuals,” he says. “I keep rejected ones in the drawer, because a good idea is a good idea.”Operation Mincemeatis at the Fortune theatre, London, and the Golden theatre, New YorkExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreMusicalsWest EndBroadwayPostersDesigninterviewsShareReuse this content"

He therefore had an almost ideal background for a nuanced, detached perspective on the impossibly (and enduringly) painful subject of French collaboration with the Nazis during the second world war.This was the basis of his four-and-a-half hour masterpiece The Sorrow and the Pity from 1969, commissioned by French TV (which refused to screen it); however, it gained an Oscar nomination and its international reputation grew from there. The film was in two parts, The Collapse, about the invasion, and The Choice, about the factional splits on the subject of resistance. It was an unflinchingly tactless and powerful look at what amounted to France’s traumatised recovered memories.View image in fullscreenMasterpiece … a still from The Sorrow and the Pity.Photograph: Norddeutscher Rundfunk/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockFor decades since 1945, France had been content to see its wartime self as martyred and embattled, enduring occupation as a tragic reversal, an almost spiritual ordeal like the trial of Joan of Arc. And for the most part, its former allies gallantly participated in this view – especially the British, who for all their Churchillian euphoria, were quietly aware that if things had gone differently, they too might have collaborated with the invader. One of the most remarkable parts of The Sorrow and the Pity is the interview given on the subject in fluent French by Anthony Eden (who audiences might have then known chiefly as the prime minister who partnered with the French over the Suez fiasco). Ophuls shows him as genial, clubbable, worldly and rather melancholy.The film, and Ophuls, punched a hole through France’s self-excusing myths and saw something nastier, shabbier, more political, more human: a society that embraced xenophobia and informing on your neighbours and in which antisemitism came to the surface. The Sorrow and the Pity takes its place with the great political movies by French directors: Jean Renoir’s The Rules of the Game (1939), Henri-Georges Clouzot’s The Raven (1943), Louis Malle’s Lacombe, Lucien (1974) and, of course, Claude Lanzmann’s Shoah (1985). The title of The Sorrow and the Pity is one of the most brilliant things about it; it is taken from a comment by a pharmacist interviewed by Ophuls who said these were the two emotions he chiefly experienced at the time. Really? Ophuls cleverly allows the audience to suspect that these were emotions experienced after, not during the Occupation, in which fear and rage and shame were perhaps stronger; sorrow and pity were the dramatic reflexes which France found to make the memories bearable and that pity has a fair bit of self-pity.

One person could be heard shouting “Woman, life, freedom!”, the slogan of the 2022-2023 protest movement that shook the Iranian authorities.On exiting, he was greeted by around a dozen supporters who had stayed up to welcome him, according to footage posted on Instagram by the Iranian director Mehdi Naderi and broadcast by the Iran International channel which is based outside Iran. Smiling broadly and waving, he was cheered, applauded, hugged and presented with flowers. “Fresh blood in the veins of Iranian independent cinema,” wrote Naderi.The warm welcome from fans at the airport contrasted with the lukewarm reaction from Iranian state media and officials to the first time an Iranian film-maker was awarded the Palme d’Or since Taste of Cherry by the late Abbas Kiarostami in 1997.‘I think of those I left behind in prison’: Iran’s Jafar Panahi on life as a banned film-makerRead moreWhile mentioned by state media such as the IRNA news agency, Panahi’s triumph has received only limited coverage inside Iran and has also sparked a diplomatic row with France. French foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot called his victory “a gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime’s oppression” in a post on X, prompting Tehran to summon France’s chargé d’affaires to protest against the “insulting” comments.“I am not an art expert, but we believe that artistic events and art in general should not be exploited to pursue political objectives,” said foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei.The film is politically charged, showing five Iranians confronting a man they believe tortured them in prison, a story inspired by Panahi’s own time in detention. After winning the prize, Panahi also made a resounding call for freedom in Iran. “Let’s set aside all problems, all differences. What matters most right now is our country and the freedom of our country.”Explore more on these topicsFilmJafar PanahiCannes film festivalIranFestivalsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The work that had defeated him? Verdi’s opera Simon Boccanegra, based on a play by the same Spanish writer as Il trovatore, the longstanding sitting duck for potshots at contorted opera plots. Even the composer diagnosed Boccanegra as “too depressing”. Yet he was persuaded to return to hispoorly received score, overhauling it with the help of Arrigo Boito (subsequently the librettist of his final operas, Otello and Falstaff). That revised version was a roaring success in 1881 and is staged quite regularly today – although marshalling its heavyweight lineup of principal basses and baritones, with only a single tenor and soprano to leaven the texture, remains a serious challenge.View image in fullscreenEnergetic … Baritone Mandla Mndebele as Paolo Albiani.Photograph: James GlossopNo stranger to those, Opera North has taken Boccanegra as the latest candidate for“concert staging”treatment, after itssuccess with Wagnerin recent years. This performance at Royal Festival Hall was the finale of a tour that has already stopped off at concert halls across the north and midlands. Directed byPJ Harris, the opera’s dark doings in Genoa played out across the three “rooms” of a subtly lit metal frame stretching across the front of the stage, with marble columns, plinths and benches for a touch of civic pomp and banners for rival political factions hanging overhead. In a gesture Basevi would presumably have appreciated, characters wore election-style rosettes to show which side they were on. The 25 years that elapse between the opera’s lengthy prologue and its first act saw one character’s parka switched for a different vintage anorak and Simon Boccanegra’s sailor peacoat swapped for a political leader’s shirt and tie. But we were otherwise rooted in a historical no man’s land of ill-fitting suits.Some principals inevitably fared better in this bare-bones set-up than others and the opera’s tell-don’t-show approach demands real singing actors even in a full staging. Alongside energetic vocal performances from baritonesMandla Mndebeleand Opera North stalwart Richard Mosley Evans as the tireless plotters Paolo Albiani and Pietro andAndrés Presno’s hefty, heartfelt tenor contributions as political rebel turned romantic Gabriele Adorno, the scenes betweenRoland Wood’s sensitive Boccanegra and his long-lost daughter Maria (Sara Cortolezzis, in a promising Opera North debut) stood out as compelling and poignant. They were amply supported by the other stars of this show: Opera North’s excellent chorus – which poured down the aisles of the auditorium for an inspired, immersive take on the ever-powerful council chamber scene – and, above all, the orchestra. Onstage throughout with principal guest conductorAntony Hermus, the musicians served up a vivid and intensely committed performance, the strings a gripping, vital dramatic motor.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicSouthbank CentrereviewsShareReuse this content"

His diaristic film documents his travels with the centrepiece being an astonishing journey from Alaska to Patagonia – first on motorbike, then on horse. Hannon’s zest for adventure first began as an undergraduate in ecology, when an encounter with a book on shamans in Indonesia urged him to move beyond the ivory tower of academia. He soon found himself inthe Mentawai islands, living among the Salakirrat clan for five years; here, the Indigenous tribe see their surrounding environment as a living entity with inner spirits and souls.As Hannon embarked on his years-long trip through the Americas, he brought this same sense of attention to the landscape, as it shifts from snow-capped mountain ranges to arid desert roads and stunning ocean waves. The cinematography glows with golden hues that bring to mind the bohemian spirit of 1970s counterculture films, an aesthetic accentuated by Daniel Norgren’s folksy soundtrack. Driven by an awe for natural beauty, the documentary also reveals its fragility, as new development in Chile and elsewhere threatens to drain rivers and wipe out whole forests.When it comes to synthesising his experiences into social commentary, however, Hannon’s narration betrays certain levels of naivety. In emphasising the importance of sustainability, he often reinforces superficial binary oppositions about eastern and western ways of life. In reality, issues such as consumerism, environmental extraction and rapid industrialisation have always existed on a global scale. In contrast to Hannon’s musings, interviews with local figures provide valuable insights, which rescue the film from being politically and intellectually adrift.The Road to Patagonia is on the Icon film channel from 30 May, and in UK cinemas from 27 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Still, two decades after their acrimonious split, the trio’s fourth album The World Is Still Here and So Are We – their first in 21 years – is getting rave reviews and they’re playing to packed houses. “Three songs in and we’ve already broken a guitar string,” sighs singer and guitarist Andrew “Falco” Falkous, insisting: “That’s not a badge of honour. It’s a technical problem.”The frontman’s ongoing struggles with tinnitus and hyperacusis mean he now has to perform wearing noise-cancelling headphones and needs a plexiglass sound barrier around Jack Egglestone’s drum kit, but with new bassist Damien Sayall thrashing away like his life depended on it they’ve lost none of their intensity. Their furious songs suggest a British Jesus Lizard or Fugazi, but the reflective She Will Only Bring You Happiness or hypnotically groovy new People Person take them somewhere else entirely.Meanwhile, Falco’s dizzying imagery and teeth-gritted delivery suggest a brilliantly absurdist wordsmith and wit in the tradition of Pere Ubu’s David Thomas or the Fall’s Mark E Smith. “Your heart’s gone the colour of Coca-Cola”, the singer yells at one point. “Your mother was a ballpoint pen thief” at another. When he cries “I’m just a normal man!” with the music as taut as a stretched elastic band, it’s dazzling.View image in fullscreenStill intense … Mclusky.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianBack in the day, singles with titles such as Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues or the superb Alan Is a Cowboy Killer were never destined to go Top 20, but are now greeted like old friends, with newbies such as Way of the Exploding Dickhead running them close already.

Centered on a 16-year-old called Rasmané, Boubacar Sangaré’s sombre documentary goes deep into the claustrophobic environment that the ill-treated workers endure. Each morning, Rasmané is lowered down a 100m shaft which leads to narrow tunnels wet with mud. As the day goes on, he is caked with the sediment as his back muscles buckle under the strenuous digging. His cramped living quarters – a rickety shed made of straw and plastic tarps – offer little relief; Rasmané has to turn to medication to ease the pain.Moving between closeups and aerial shots, the film draws a visual link between the abuse inflicted on the scarred soil, and the physical strain on the workers’ bodies. In this precarious industry where human beings are treated as collateral damage, talk of death casually hangs in the air. The intimate photography, however, lends a dignity to those who are discarded by an exploitative industry. Rasmané and his fellow workmates are often filmed in groups, collective compositions that emphasise the nature of their bond. As the company skims on safety protocols, the companionship among the men becomes a kind of emotional shelter as they trade life tips ranging from survival to romance.Considering the overwhelming responsibilities placed on the shoulders of these teenagers, it’s easy to forget that they are still kids at heart. A particularly moving sequence follows the younger “cart boys” who dream of ordinary treats such as a new pair of jeans in between shifts. This collision of childlike yearning and hard labour is particularly heartbreaking; in the eyes of their bosses, however, the future of these workers is nothing compared to the lure of gold.A Golden Life is on True Story from 30 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsGoldMiningBurkina FasoAfricaCommoditiesreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is not the Renaissance as the textbooks teach it. Dylan MarcAurele’s musical comedy mashes up Medici Florence and high-camp modernity to trace two friends’ journey from gay schoolmates (bit of a historical stretch, that) to the greatest artists of their age. It couldn’t be trashier but in the spaces between art history and anachronism, flamboyant rudeness and lyrical wit, there’s fun to be had.No point pretending Pop Off, Michelangelo! takes much interest in these Old Masters’ art, nor in the era. But it’s all over their queerness – atoning for which drives Michelangelo to dump his BFF and seek Sistine Chapel salvation. But can they swerve the attentions of religious firebrand Savonarola, in an age turning increasingly cynical thanks to pizza chef and aspiring philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli?It is, in short, a kitsch Renaissance cartoon; subtlety is not its selling point. “You truly made marble your bitch,” Michelangelo’s teacher tells him, while Leonardo’s arrest for sodomy is apologised for as follows: “I was so stupid. I thought Savonarola was a stripper.” But if Da Vinci-style depth of field is beyond it, Pop Off, Michelangelo! frolics enjoyably in the foreground. Careerist but concerned Max Eade and sly, soppy Aidan MacColl are an engaging Michelangelo and Leonardo, plotting their respective paths between safety and self-expression.Sashaying around in his golden cape, Michael Marouli’s Pope makes for an amusingly unlikely gatekeeper of the hetero status quo. Laura Sillett gives good “mwa ha ha” as the villainous friar, and Aoife Haakenson contributes an apropos-of-little showstopper in character as a certain movie star from the 21st century. The pop score is perfectly winning, even if Michelangelo’s ballad about God and Jesus fits ill with the part of the story it’s meant to tell. The show’s freewheeling spirit, though, which twins twerking and 1400s Tuscany, and has a notorious puritan fanatic teased for dressing by Temu, is very easy to submit to.At Underbelly Boulevard, London, until 13 July.Explore more on these topicsStageMusicalsComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)TheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The initials stand for “length over all” – or what one aficionado he interviewed calls “phallic sizing”. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, before he got the idea of sending celebrities like Katy Perry into space, commissioned a $485m yacht called Koru. With its towering masts, the 127 metre-long boat proved too tall to pass beneath Rotterdam’s famous Koningshaven Bridge, and while its manufacturers suggested dismantling the bridge, rather than the yacht, the heroes of that particular story – the Dutch – refused.I had a similar problem recently. Delivery people couldn’t remove our old fridge because we had, in the interim, narrowed the hall with an understairs cupboard. In that moment, I identified with Bezos. True, as Osnos reports, one well-stocked diesel yacht can produce as much greenhouse gas as 1,500 passenger cars, while my broken fridge produces none, but the parallel remains.In 1990, there were 66 US billionaires; by 2023 there were over 700In this droll and timely analysis of extreme wealth, New Yorker staff writer Osnos notes that superyacht demand is outstripping supply. In some countries you have to wait for bread, water or inoculations; in others for giant sea-going vessels. In 1990, there were 66 US billionaires; by2023there were over 700, an increase of more than 1,000%. In the same period, the number of US yachts measuring longer than 76 metres has gone from “less than 10 to more than 170”. Median US hourly wages, in contrast, have risen by just 20%. Maths is not my strong suit, but this suggests inequality is spiralling.There’s also a spiralling inequality in political power. Trump postures as a president for blue-collar Americans, but the people who shared the stage when he took his oath of office on 20 January tell another story. In that symbolic moment Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Bezos and Sergey Brin showed their influence was rising with their net worth. “The world watched America embrace plutocracy without shame or pretence,” writes Osnos.Meanwhile, shame and pretence are in plentiful supply elsewhere. One yacht owner tells Osnos: “No one today – except for assholes and ridiculous people – lives on land in what you would call a deep and broad luxe life. Yes, people have nice houses and all of that, but it’s unlikely that the ratio of staff to them is what it is on a boat. Boats are the last place that I think you can get away with it.”In other words, the modern versions of Hearst Castle and Blenheim Palace are discreetly mobile, able to whisk themselves out of sight at a moment’s notice. It dovetails nicely with a political agenda best articulated by Peter Thiel. The venture capitalist, Osnos reports, gave start-up capital to the Seasteading Institute, which seeks to create floating mini-states – part of his libertarian project to “escape from politics in all its forms”. And, presumably, to “get away with it”.In any event, it’s not just how big your superyacht is, but what you put inside it. The latest fashions include Imax theatres, ski rooms where guests can suit up for a helicopter trip to a mountaintop, and hospital equipment that enables onboard pathogen tests. That last detail is key: Covid accelerated the desire of the super-rich to get away by any means necessary from, with due respect, plebs like you and me.The have-yachts seem to be following the Thorstein Veblen playbook. When the economist wrote The Theory of the Leisure Class in 1899, he argued that the power of “conspicuous consumption” involved revelling in showy wastefulness. You’ll be wanting a personal submarine for your yacht, not to mention eel and stingray leather for its upholstery. Osnos lists what can be delivered to your watery fastness: Zabar’s bagels, rare melons from Hokkaido, Dom Pérignon, sex workers.

Superyachts are a terrible asset class in that they lose value faster than you can say bonfire of the vanities. “Owning a superyacht is like owning a stack of 10 Van Goghs,” argued the Financial Times, “only you are holding them over your head as you tread water, trying to keep them dry.” But then again, as Veblen understood, maybe that’s part of the point?The Haves and Have-Yachts: Dispatches on the Ultrarich by Evan Osnos is published by Simon & Schuster (£22).

So it’s a disappointment to see his latest outing, Hello Stranger, narrow its scope to a cheesy trial-by-internet that lacks the social commentary of Squid Game, from which it nabs its masked, filtered-voice tormentor.Cam (George Blagden) is a shut-in working on assorted remote assignments from a hermetically sealed, computer-controlled London apartment. His main companion is Sasha, the digital assistant that runs his life (voiced by either Derek Jacobi or Yasmin Finney). Depending on whether you opt for being in a couple or single at the appropriate fork, hypothetical American girlfriend Mimi (Christina Wolfe) or neglected young brother Alfie (Danny Griffin) are the significant humans Cam is keeping neurotically at arm’s length. He prefers the company of online randomers plucked from a Chatroulette-style app called Hello Stranger that fatefully serves him up an anonymous sadist who locks him into his flat and forces him to play three games.There’s a hint of engagement with the zeitgeist in the references to digital-age isolation in the preamble, as Cam flits through conversations with an academic researcher, a London wide boy and an elderly influencer. But little of it filters meaningfully into the main event, where you must choose to play either solo or against other players. (A single playthrough takes just under an hour.) These games err towards binary, right-or-wrong responses that aren’t conducive to opening up dramatic avenues; where The Gallery had a rich tree of cascading consequences, the bareness of the structure here is exposed in how often Raschid reverts to simple bouts of paper-scissor-stones that express nothing about the games master, or the rats in his maze.Lead actor Blagden at least holds the centre with an ennui that suggests a man whose edges have been rubbed off by digital saturation. But Hello Stranger is otherwise unengaging in cinematic terms – and its interactive side feels hobbled (despite the inclusion of a gaming mode, which offers up five rudimentary video games as part of the challenges). To judge this ordeal on its own reptile-brain terms, even the smorgasbord of possible deaths for Cam is repetitive and flavourless.Hello Stranger is at Genesis cinema, London, as part of its Interactive film club until December, and available on Steam on 29 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

He reconstructs a cockpit and an airport lounge, and even starts TV singing competition Wings of Voice.

I don’t doubt it. But now, with the wind getting up and a mist creeping over the ridge, there’s little to see other than the ground at our feet. Which is why my attention is drawn to, shall we say, a canine deposit.“But there are no dogs up here. It’s been two hours and just over four miles since that yappy little mongrel in the last village. And there are certainly no dog walkers; not one hint of another human in this wild terrain. No, the size, shape and furriness of this trailside offering reveal its author was the ancestor of all dogs: a wolf.I reach for my binoculars, but in this mist it’s pointless. Besides, even under blue skies, no self-respecting wolf just sits around to be gawped at. But it’s thrilling to know they’re here; that Europe’s alpha predator, once driven out of Portugal, is making a comeback. Two packs now roam these hills, and this must be one of their calling cards.View image in fullscreenA statue on the route the Romans first took around 200BC.Photograph: Mike UnwinIt’s mid-April, and my wife and I are tramping through Peneda-Gerês national park, in northern Portugal, on day two of a six-day walk withOn Foot Holidays. Our route takes us broadly south, covering 55 miles of mountain, forest and meadow as it winds from the little hamlet of Soajo to the monastery of Santa Maria do Bouro. It’s a decent hike, but each morning our bags are ferried by road to the next night’s retreat, so we need carry only day packs.The park, designated in 1971, lies not far north of the popular Douro valley, but is far off the tourist trail. Amazingly, it remains the only national park in Portugal. And it’s steeped in history: our trail was first blazed by the Romans, as they marched north around 200BC to subdue hostile Celtic tribes and strengthen their hold on the Iberian peninsula.This early in the season, the weather is a lucky dip (May, early June, late September and October are among the best times to visit). We arrive in Porto to showers, scuttling from Dom Luís Bridge to Clérigos Tower, then ducking into the Benedictine monastery for a fado (traditional Portuguese music) performance – which reduces us to tears, despite not understanding a word. Next morning, the skies have cleared. And when we arrive in Soajo – two hours from Porto by train and taxi – we find its stone walls bathed in afternoon sunshine. Fallen oranges litter the cobbles, and a hoopoe intones its hoop, hoop refrain from the church tower beside our B&B.We snake across mossy woods bubbling with birdsong, tumbling rivers on ancient stone bridges and flanks of airy moorlandOn our first day’s walking we strike out south, armed with a hefty packed lunch that includes a slab of traditional Pão de Ló Easter cake from our Soajo host’s family bakery. Our trail snakes through mossy woods bubbling with birdsong, crosses tumbling rivers on ancient stone bridges, and traverses flanks of airy moorland, where Dartford warblers scold from the heather and Iberian wall lizards dodge our advancing boots.It hasn’t taken long to hit our stride. By the end of the day, we have more than 11.5km under our belts. Where possible, we stick to old-school navigation, poring over On Foot’s map and trail notes. Their app provides digital back-up, and reassurance comes from the red-and-white way-markers daubed on rocks and tree trunks – helpful, as not once do we meet another hiker to set us straight.Our bolthole for night two is a cottage in picture-postcard Lindoso village, overlooking a hillside ofespigueiros– the traditional grain stores, raised on stone pillars and crowned with crucifixes, emblematic of this region. We dine at Casa do Destro, devouring the first of the week’s bakedbacalhau(salted cod) andgrelos(turnip tops), washed down with the gentle fizz of a local vinho verde.On day two of our trek, the weather creates another country. Brief windows in the cloud and drizzle reveal a wild landscape, daunting in scale and seemingly more suited to wolves than hikers. At one point, the mist parts around a huge ridgetop boulder that appears – to me, at least – uncannily like a wolf’s head.View image in fullscreenGranaries and stone storage sheds in Lindoso village.Photograph: imageBROKER.com/AlamyToday turns out to be the most arduous and weather-battered of our week. Happily, it culminates in our most luxurious bolthole. Reaching the tiny hamlet of Brufe, after almost 23km, we collapse into the warm embrace of Leiras do Tempo. Two nights here allow us time to recover, dry our gear and admire the views.In the morning, with no imperative to move on, we linger over a lavish late breakfast before setting out for the Casarotas wolf trap. Our itinerary describes this hike as “optional”, but the name is too intriguing to resist and soon we’re tramping back uphill through a yellow blaze of gorse and broom in the sunshine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Believed to date back to the 18th century, it comprises two dry-stone walls that descend a steep hillside in a V-shape, converging on a hidden pit. Here, farmers fearful for their livestock drove wolves down to the bottom and slaughtered them. Today, the walls are lichen-encrusted relics of a bygone age. But the wolves are back. Clearly, they were playing the long game.Farmers fearful for their livestock drove wolves down to the bottom of the pit and slaughtered themTwo days later, we descend even deeper into history. Soon after departing our overnight at Campo de Gerês (more bacalhau; more espigueiros), we join the Roman road – a two person-wide granite contour path that winds south through deep woods of oak and pine. Occasional information plaques and life-sized metal cut-outs of legionaries confirm that we’re on the right track – as do the more ancient milestones left by the Romans themselves.The woods swallow us, and with little by way of modernity to break the spell, it’s easy to fantasise about the imperial troops that once marched here. Run-off from the rains has turned some stretches into a river, making stepping stones of the ancient cobbles. “Must have been tricky doing this in sandals,” says my wife.View image in fullscreenCasarotas wolf trap.Photograph: Mike UnwinI also fantasise about the wildlife of yesteryear. There were bears here back then, as well as wolves. Today, leaf litter excavations betray the presence of wild boars, while the long-horned barrosãcattle that browse in the bracken prompt thoughts of the extinct wild aurochs that once roamed these parts. Nature also brings smaller offerings: a golden oriole flashing through the canopy; orchids bejewelling a hidden meadow; a fire salamander on the track, its vivid black and yellow an unambiguous warning not to touch.It’s early afternoon on day six when the towers of the Mosteiro de Amares appear. This 12th-century Cistercian monastery in picturesque Santa Maria do Bouro is now a classy pousada (hotel): our journey’s end. There is much to explore here – cloisters, orange groves, a pool – and tonight we will dine sumptuously beneath the high stone ceilings. But for now, we collapse in our room with a complimentary port. The mountains loom beyond our window. We didn’t see wolves, but I’d like to think wolves saw us – and that’s good enough for me.The trip was provided byOn Foot Holidays.

The ease of just unrolling a sheet, scattering it with something delicious and giving it a quick stint in the oven, and dinner has almost cooked itself. This variation, with an olive tapenade-spiked cream cheese base, asparagus and eggs works as well for dinner as it does for a weekend brunch. If you’re a chilli fiend, a scattering of hot chilli flakes (or, indeed, sliced fresh chilli) won’t go amiss, either.Asparagus tart with tapenade and eggsPrep15 minCook20 minServes4320gready-rolled puff pastry(ideally all butter)150g full-fat cream cheese3 heapedtsp black olive tapenade– I likeBelazu400gasparagus1tsp olive oilSea salt flakes4mediumeggs1tsp aleppo chilli flakes(optional)Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7.

With a sharp knife, score a border all around the pastry 2½cm from the outer edge.Mix the cream cheese and tapenade in a small bowl, then spread this all over the pastry up to the scored border.Snap or cut the woody ends off the asparagus, tip the spears into a bowl, add the olive oil and a half-teaspoon of salt, and toss to coat. Arrange the spears all over the pastry, drizzle over the oil from the bowl, then bake for 15 minutes.Take the tart out of the oven, make four holesand crack in the eggs. Turn down the oven to 200C (180C fan)/350F/gas 4, then bake the tart for six minutes more, until the egg whites are set and the yolks are set on top but still soft to the touch – they should be runny inside (if you prefer your yolks cooked through, give the eggs eight minutes instead, but be aware that oven temperatures vary, so check after six minutes to avoid overcooked, bouncy yolks).Scatter the tart with some flaky sea salt and the chilli flakes, if using, and serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsBakingQuick and easyFoodVegetablesSpring food and drinkMain coursePieEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"

If you are lucky enough to have your own patch of land, however big or (for most of us town dwellers) small it may be, there is probably at least enough room for a little grill that will serve you well throughout the summer. But even for those who are garden-less (as we are), there is no reason not to enjoy the delights of a barbecue. Charred smashed burgers are all the rage, and making them using chicken rather than beef lightens the whole thing up. Serve with beautifully grilled asparagus and you have a meal fit for a king.Smashed chicken burgers with harissa tahini, pickled red onions and grilled tomatoes (pictured top)This is all about the preparation, because the actual cooking time is very fast. Make all the components in advance and have everything ready to go, then all you need is a super-hot grill (ideally one with both a heavy flat-iron top and a griddle top) to bring it all together in minutes. This is great, messy party food, and you can increase the quantities to allow for as many people as you want to feed – just don’t forget the napkins.Prep15 minCook40 minMakes4 singleburgers, or 2 double loaded ones4 brioche burger buns,halved2 large plum tomatoes, halvedOlive oil, for drizzlingSea salt1baby gem lettuce, or 1 heart of romaine lettuce, leaves separatedFor the harissa tahini1 smallgarlic clove, peeled and mincedA pinch of table saltJuice of ½ lemon1 tomato, halved and grated, skin discarded20g harissa paste60g tahiniFor the semi-pickled onion1 red onion, peeled, halved and thinly sliced (about 100g)½ tsp salt½ tsp sugar½ tsp sumac1 tbsp red-wine vinegarFor the smashed burger350gchicken mince1 tsp paprika½ tsp ground pimento(allspice)½ tsp saltBlack pepper10g parsley leaves, choppedDrizzle the cut sides of the buns and tomatoes with a little olive oil, sprinkle with sea salt, then set aside. Mix all the ingredients for the harissa tahini to a smooth paste and set aside. Mix the sliced onions with the rest of the pickled onion ingredients and set aside.Mix all the burger ingredients until well combined, then put a little oil on your palms, divide the mix evenly and shape into balls weighing about 90g each. Put each chicken burger on a 12cm square sheet of baking paper and drizzle a little olive oil on top.Fire up the barbecue and set a heavy cast-iron pan on it; if you’re cooking this indoors, set a heavy-based cast-iron pan and a griddle pan on the hob. Put the buns and tomatoes cut-side down on the griddle, until they take on a nice char pattern and a little smoke, then transfer to a plate.One at a time, lay a burger meat-side down on the griddle, and press down on the paper with a flat-bottomed heavy pan to flatten it out to just over the size of the bun. Cook for three minutes, then flip and cook on the other side for two minutes more. Repeat with the remaining burgers.Spread both cut sides of each bun with harissa tahini, then lay a lettuce leaf or two on the bottom bun. Top with a burger, slices of the grilled tomato and some pickled onions Pop on the lids and serve.Grilled asparagus with pistachio, garlic and lime saladView image in fullscreenHoney & Co’s grilled asparagus with pistachio, garlic and lime salad.Celebrating British asparagus is almost like a national holiday; we love the season and wish it was longer. A version of this dish has appeared on every spring menu at our restaurantHoney & Smokein central London for the past eight years, and this one is easy to make at home, either on a barbecue or in a griddle pan in the kitchen. It will hopefully become a spring staple for you, too.Prep15 minCook25 minServes4For the garlic oil3garlic cloves, peeled and thinly slicedJuice of 1 lime and 3 wide stripslimezest(use a peeler)3 tbsp olive oil½ tsp flaky sea saltFor the salad400g cleaned asparagus– bases peeled if woody2 baby gem lettuces, washed and halved lengthways through the stemSea salt andblack pepper40g toasted pistachios, roughly choppedStart by making the oil. Put the garlic and lime zest in a small pan, pour over the olive oil, then heat slowly to one side of the barbecue (or on the stovetop), until the garlic starts to fizz a little; take off the heat, add the salt and leave to infuse.Season the asparagus spears and lettuce with two tablespoons of the infused oil (take the oil from the top, keeping all the garlicky bits for later), then sprinkle with a little flaky sea salt and some ground black pepper.Grill the asparagus and the lettuce cut side down on a hot barbecue (or, if indoors, a very hot griddle pan), until they start to char and cook. Transfer the charred lettuce cooked side up to a platter, then top with the griddled asparagus.Mix the lime juice into the remaining garlic oil, add the chopped pistachios, drizzle the dressing all over the salad and serve.Explore more on these topicsFoodBurgersChickenMeatMain courseSaladVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"
