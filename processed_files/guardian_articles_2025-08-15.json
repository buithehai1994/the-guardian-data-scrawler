It’s also proof, if proof were needed, that no teacher in the world can be as cruel and abusive as a music teacher. We have already seen JK Simmons’ terrifying jazz instructor in Damien Chazelle’s Whiplash and Isabelle Huppert’s keyboard monster in Michael Haneke’s The Piano Teacher; now there is Slovenian actor and musician Saša Tabaković playing a demanding, yet insidious choirmaster in charge of a group of talented, vulnerable teenage girls. The film incidentally has a lesson for any teenage person watching: if a music teacher asks you to sit next to them on the piano stool with no one else in the room and murmurs “You can confide in me” … you can’t.The English title is taken from Sonic Youth’s Little Trouble Girl, but otherwise this is strictly a matter of holy music. (The Slovenian original is Kaj Ti Je Deklica, which means “what’s wrong with you girl?”). Lucija (played by newcomer Jara Sofija Ostan) is a shy 16-year-old who is a member of her Catholic school’s female choir; with her sexy, worldly, mercurial best friend Ana-Marija (Mina Švajger) she joins the choir’s special trip across the Italian border for a week in Cividale del Friuli near Trieste; they rehearse in a nunnery, a lovely building with a courtyard featuring an olive tree, which is to assume a poetic quality as Lucija gazes at it during sleepless nights.To the intense irritation of the choirmaster, building work is going on, the noise from which disrupts his rehearsals, and darkens and complicates his mood. The girls look dreamily at the semi-clothed men doing the work, whom they also spy on as they go swimming, and there are many games of spin-the-bottle and truth-or-dare after lights out. The choral sequences of the film are wonderful, and the simple business of rehearsing, of taking music to pieces and putting it back together, is gripping. Tabaković’s choirmaster is brilliant and demanding, with a born musician’s natural severity but, as we are to see, something darker. The film’s sound design is stunning in the sequences when we hear the girls’ breathing exercises which themselves become a kind of eerie choral setpiece that mimics unconscious sexual excitement.Lucija and Ana-Marija boldly ask a kindly nun, Sister Magda (Saša Pavček) what it is like to do without physical pleasures and she tries honestly to answer that there is fulfilment in sublimating them into devotion to Christ. Is that what is happening with their music? Is that what the film is showing us: that their sexual development is being systematically suppressed, dammed, re-routed into religious music? Or could it be that sexuality is merely the inauthentic, immature version of music?Then there is the fateful, intimate encounter between the choirmaster and Lucija; he asks her to confide what troubles her, and Lucija rashly gives her an answer that deeply displeases and disappoints him, with awful results. It is then superseded by a kind of epiphany coda, enigmatically taking us forward to the next stage in Lucija’s life. This is an utterly absorbing and outstandingly acted film.Little Trouble Girls screened at theEdinburgh film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsSloveniaChoral musicCatholicismChristianityEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

He keeps all his belongings, including a guitar, tied up together on a two-wheeled buggy.“This is shelter. It’s a safe place where I can put my buggy up against the wall, and it’s up against that beam so nobody can roll it,” said Pugh. “I roll it on its back, and then I sleep alongside of it, so nobody can get it without me waking up.”‘An intimidation tactic’: Trump’s show of force dismays Washington residentsRead moreHe’s one of the more than 5,000 people in the city without a permanent place to live and now facing uncertainty about where to find shelter afterDonald Trumpsaidhomeless peoplein DC must be moved far from the city.Crews tore down a major encampment near the Kennedy Center on Thursday, with federal law enforcement removing residents and clearing out the remaining encampments across the city overnight. The removal is part of Trump’s federal takeover of the city’s police department and deployment of the national guard across the city.Pugh believes theTrump administrationis out of line for blaming crime on unhoused individuals. “It’s not illegal to be homeless,” he said.Despite the widespread encampment closures, Pugh told the Guardian he didn’t have any plans to visit a shelter this week and wanted to stay close to his spot. “If they tell me to roll, I’ll roll and I’ll come back when they leave,” he said.View image in fullscreenPolice remove a homeless man from the steps of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History on Thursday in Washington DC.Photograph: Kayla Bartkowski/Getty ImagesIn an encampment across the city, near the interchange of Rock Creek Parkway and Whitehurst Freeway, one homeless individual, who identified himself as G, had already packed up his belongings. He said he had had to bounce around to various locations over the last few weeks.“It’s just going with the punches,” said G. “So you just never get settled. It feels like you [are] on the edge.”G is also just days away from moving off the streets and into permanent housing. He said the only thing he’s missing is a new social security card, which he will have very soon, but until then, he’s not sure where he will go.“What am I supposed to do for six days? Am I supposed to tell the national guard, or whoever, I got six days? Gonna get six days, and I literally have the appointment at the social security [office] on the 20th,” said G.With encampments now closed around DC and just a few days before he can secure stable housing, G said he may consider staying at a shelter.“I know the shelters might be full. I don’t even know where a shelter is, they haven’t gave us any list. No, nothing. They just made us fully aware of possibilities,” he said.According to the DC office of the deputy mayor for health and human services, unhoused residents who want shelter will not be turned away, and the city is prepared to expand capacity as necessary.View image in fullscreenA homeless encampment in Washington DC on Thursday.Photograph: Kirstin GarrissBut if homeless individuals refuse to leave encampments, the Trump administration said their options are limited.During a news briefing earlier this week, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said homeless individuals could face fines or even jail time if they refused to go to a shelter or receive addiction or mental health services.“We’re in the business of making sure people have the information, they have the connection to resources if they choose, but then people are, you know, left up to make their own decisions,” said Kierstin Quinsland, chief program officer at Miriam’s Kitchen, a homeless service provider in DC. “However, it is extremely concerning that people are being threatened with arrest if they are refusing services.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The solution to homelessness is housing and supports, not handcuffs and jails,” said Rabinowitz in a written statement.Quinsland said advocates and community partners have mobilized to keep an eye on encampment closures to make sure unhoused individuals are offered support and “treated as respectfully as possible”.She said one of their biggest concerns about these federal police sweeps is losing contact with homeless residents. In many cases, Quinsland said advocates work with members of the city’s unhoused population for weeks, months or longer if they are trying to move them toward permanent housing.“Trust is an issue in homeless outreach, you know. A lot of folks [who] are outside, they decline shelter for a reason, because they don’t trust services,” said Quinsland. “So these relationships that we have with folks are precious, and they are hard fought.”View image in fullscreenA homeless encampment outside the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial Library in Washington DC on Thursday.Photograph: Kirstin GarrissAdvocates also warn that these citywide encampment closures may separate homeless individuals from critical support and social services.“If they’re moved somewhere where they don’t know where they can get a meal, they don’t even know how to get back to the neighborhoods that they’re familiar with,” said Quinsland.Ahead of the encampment closures, Quinsland said outreach street teams with Miriam’s Kitchen have been passing inexpensive mobile phones to unhoused residents to help them stay connected.“Making sure that they have our phone numbers, have our business cards with them, to make sure that wherever they may end up, we can remain in contact,” she said.With Trump’s temporary takeover of the DC police department in place for the next few weeks, Quinsland said there had also been discussion about bussing homeless residents to neighboring areas like Montgomery county, Maryland, or parts of Virginia to be “out of sight of Donald Trump”.But that’s just a temporary fix, she said, as homeless service providers need more funding to address the issue.“The long-term answer is, if we have the political will to put money in the city budget for housing, then we can do that,” said Quinsland. “This year, there is zero dollars in the budget for permanent supportive housing vouchers, so that’s not a help.”Explore more on these topicsWashington DCHomelessnessUS policingTrump administrationLaw (US)US politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Luckily, it’s all being kept very privateFri 15 Aug 2025 08.49 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 16.00 EDTShareWhat is “Brand Beckham”? I don’t mean to question the very idea of a celebrity brand – far from it. In fact, part of the reason that celeb-watching phrases like “the brand” and “controlling the narrative” have gone completely mainstream is because of David andVictoria Beckham. So ubiquitous is the professionalisation of celebrity these days, and so media-literate is the public, that it’s hard to remember just how revolutionary the Beckhams were in British culture back in the day. Twenty-five years ago, nobody except some rarefied elite publicist wanged on about narratives. But now everyone knows how to read an influencer. Almost all celebrities are regarded primarily as people who are selling something. Furthermore, people act like mis-selling a lifestyle is worse than several major financial crimes.Anyway, back to the brand. What is the Beckham brand? Not their many specific product brands, nor the many other ones to which they lend their images for advertising. The thing I’m talking about is more like a movie star’s screen persona. The unifying characteristic, the theme that permeates all their roles, the magic that fans go back for. In the case of the Beckhams, the brand is really their family. Two became six.In the more distant past, this meant Victoria and David selling news of their pregnancies to OK! magazine, then selling the first baby photos and so on. In the age of Instagram, as their children have grown up, it has meant constantly tending this idyllic image by posting private family moments, having everyone show up en masse for the launch of each other’s football seasons/fashion shows/face primers/food lines/50th birthday marathons, and dutifully sending daily public messages of love, support and thanks to each other across social media platforms where others can see them. Whether it’s family or business – and sometimes it isn’t entirely clear where the dividing line is – it’s all very much the family business.As distilled in David’s Netflix documentary – self-commissioned, naturally – the message is that no matter what triumph or disaster comes their way, the Beckham family are about each other. Any adversity is folded into their story and ends up being repurposed into (lucrative) triumph because this is a family that sticks together, and which draws its strength from that. It’s aspirational and sometimes charming. It has worked.So what happens when a gaping hole is blown in the idyll? In some of the most eye-popping showbiz news of the summer, it has emerged beyond all doubt that one of the family – firstborn Brooklyn – wants nothing to do with the others. If the idea of a feud was plausibly deniable back when Brooklyn and his wife, Nicola Peltz, got married three years ago, it was harder to maintain when the pair didn’t show up for any of David’s 50th birthday celebrations this May. It is now impossible, following Brooklyn and Nicola’s decision to post to Instagram huge numbers of photos of their very recentwedding vow renewal ceremony. (Vow renewals: another part of modern celeb culture that didn’t really happen before they happened in magazine buy-ups or on social media.) Details of the lavish big day? The ceremony was officiated by Nicola’s billionaire father, Nelson, and she wore her mother’s wedding dress. Oh, and not a single member of the Beckham family was there, and it’s said they only found out about it by reading it online.Questions abound, from various sides of the fence. To a list of occupations which already includes footballer, photographer, model,monograph authorand chef, is Brooklyn adding hostage? How can the Beckhams bear the pain of rejection? Or do people really cut themselves off from highly functional families? One of Nicola’s friends who attended the ceremony posted in praise of having “the guts to walk away” from “a toxic family”. Victoria’s own self-commissionedNetflix documentarywas due to come out this autumn (executive producer: David Beckham). How on earth is it going to spin this? Anything other than four hours of open-heart soul-searching is going to look a bit “Tractor production up in Volgograd!”The cautionary sadness is that these questions can’t really be considered invasive because they relate to a show the Beckhams have eagerly invited us to watch at every possible moment. The family has so assiduously cultivated the public engagement with their internal dynamics, choosing daily to live out loud across social media. For better – but now, for worse. It feels a little much to slap the adjective “Shakespearean” on a story which involves a guy who once included the worst picture ever taken of an elephant ina coffee-table bookof his own photography (launch party held at Christie’s London). But there is certainly a tragic irony that social media, which the Beckhams have hitherto controlled so masterfully – has been the place that exposed their schisms.They were undone by omission, given that one of the other things our first family have embodied is a complete shift in showbiz journalism. So much entertainment coverage now comes from parsing who is or isn’t tagged in Instagram posts, who has stopped following who, who omitted to like this or that. And anyone can do this. It’s a form of mass Kremlinology.At the peak of their tabloid fame – or the first peak, perhaps we should say now – it became commonplace to suggest that in the modern era, the Beckhams were our real royal family. They seemed a reaction against all that old blood, that nepo privilege, that public repression of private truth. But now? Well, perhaps some of the plotlines are converging. Perhaps the House of Windsor and the House of Beckham are not so different after all.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It could resemble Samsung’sFlip design– closer to a 2000s-style clamshell phone – or itsFold, more like a foldable iPad.AJPMorgan reporthas suggested that the first foldable iPhone will be revealed in September 2026, priced at $1,999 (£1,474), and will likely expand a foldable phone market expected to reach 19m units in 2025.The rectangular tablet has been a mainstay of phone design for the last 15 years, but could Apple betting on the flip phone be a sign that’s about to change?Tech experts said the new product launch probably reflected the fact that people now mostly access the internet on their phones, rather than laptops or tablets, and are looking for a device that optimises that experience – but the high price point suggests it will remain a premium product.“Apple and all other smartphone makers are somewhat stymied by the fact the smartphone has become somewhat of a boring category – it’s absolutely essential in people’s daily lives, but it no longer has the excitement of the next big thing,” said Ben Wood, an analyst at the tech consultancy CCS Insight.This is why Apple has been reaching for new designs that can get people talking – for example, the ultra-thin iPhone, expected to be launched in September.Wood thinks Apple is entering the foldable market because other companies have experimented first. Samsung’s initial Galaxy Fold designs were bedevilled by screen problems, but next week’s Galaxy Flip and Fold 7 triple release, featuring slimmer designs and bigger screens, is expected to represent the “next generation” of foldable phones, which Samsung will be hoping reversesthe flatlining salesin 2024.“Apple is rarely first to anything – it’s not typically a company that dives in with both feet – it likes to take its time, see how it can refine and optimise it, and deliver the best, most reliable experience, then it jumps,” Wood said.He noted that Samsung’s flip phone has been more popular than the fold model “because it’s cheaper and has captured imagination of the population who like the idea of having something different from everyone else”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This, combined with the fact that young people, especially, tend to use smartphones to go online, suggests that the foldable design could offer an ideal compromise for future consumers.Prof Ben Carter, who researches how smartphones impact our lives at King’s College London, agreed that video watching was “one of the wins” for foldable phones, especially since videos constitute a growing proportion of the content that people consume. Foldable phones can have larger screens and can also be propped up for easier viewing.He thought there could be mental health benefits to a design resembling a “mini-laptop that you can close down”. His research shows that disabling notifications is highly effective in reducing screen time and tackling smartphone addiction.If the screen is not visible, it removes the “variable reward scheme” – the same process by which gambling addiction works, whereby not knowing when you will receive a reward makes something more compelling. “If you can switch it off, more like a laptop, that distraction has gone,” he said, though he noted there waws not yet evidence that people are using foldable phones in this way.This might be especially beneficial for children, who receive on average more than 200 notifications a day – though the high price point of foldable phones makes it unlikely that many will have access to them until their parents pass on secondhand models several years after launch.Prof David Ellis, the chair of behavioural science at the University of Bath, said that other draws include the fact that screens are better protected and fit into a smaller pocket, as well as the “sense of nostalgia that comes with a flip phone”.But he added that it might not be the gamechanger people are expecting: Apple doesn’t have a “100% success rate – theVision Pro[headset] has been a spectacular failure”.Explore more on these topicsAppleMobile phonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But when I saw the longlist, I had to actFri 15 Aug 2025 11.40 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 11.44 EDTShareLast week, I withdrew my nomination from the longlist for the Polari first book prize. The awards had become mired in controversy due to the nomination of the Irish author John Boyne, best known for The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, for the main prize for his novel Earth. Four days before the longlist announcement, Boyne hadwritten in the Irish Independent, celebrating JK Rowling “as a fellow terf” and saying of women who had “pilloried” her for her gender activism: “For every Commander Waterford, there’s a Serena Joy standing behind him, ready to pin a handmaiden down as her husband rapes her.”I think such a viewpoint is abhorrent, but Boyne is free to hold whatever views he wants. What was unacceptable was astatementfrom the Polari prize addressing the backlash, emphasising its commitment to “support trans rights and amplify trans voices”, but defending Boyne’s inclusion on the grounds that submissions are assessed purely “on the merits of craft and content” and that “within our community, we can at times hold radically different positions on substantive issues”.I immediately withdrewupon reading it, after the resignation of judge Nicola Dinan, who won the prize last year, and withdrawal of fellow longlisted author Mae Diansangu. Since then, a further judge has withdrawn and at least 16 authors across both lists have excused themselves from consideration. It was not a difficult or painful decision – I felt misled about the principles underpinning the organisation and I no longer cared to be awarded by it. I have, in the past, been shortlisted for my work alongside writers whose views I did not agree with. But in those instances, their positions didn’t undermine the stated values and politics of the prize. This isn’t a matter of differing views, but of an institution properly and accurately representing itself.The prize has always been for the entire LGBTQ+ community, as evidenced by previously shortlisted, and winning, entries from trans writers. And so it is a contradiction to include someone who is trans-exclusionary (terf stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminist). The prize claims that it does “not eliminate books based on the wider views of the writer”. But a prize claiming to be a celebration of LGBTQ+ inclusion should know that the condition of trans people isn’t reducible to a debate in which people are simply holding “different positions” – they are a minority group facing unprecedented levels of harassment and political antagonism.Not all of my fellow longlisted authors have chosen this path; some have, while affirming their commitment to trans rights, stated their intentions to remain. Avi Ben-Zeev (the only trans author nominated)stated his reasoningas, “If I walk away, I’m erasing my trans story” andregretted that“transphobia has shifted the conversation away from the celebration of LGBTQ+ literature”, while emphasising the solidarity between longlisted writers regardless of their decision.I can understand such a position, but I think it undermines collective solidarity, rather than being an example of it. I think there is significant power in authors acting as a collective bloc. I was particularly moved by the example of the US writers whowithdrew from the PEN America literary awardslast year, in protest against the institution’s lack of criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza. And to me, the real celebration of LGBTQ+ literature has come not from the prize, but from the community that has rallied behind the withdrawn authors. Our withdrawal has been followed by a 800-strong petition to remove Boyne from the longlist. That is not about him per se – he is obviously suffering great personal upset at this situation. It is, once again, about the stated aims of the organisation.We have, of course, been subjected to the usual name-calling: described as the “Trans Taliban” and “Queer Isis” by Julie Bindel; accused of being proponents of “radicalised”, “totalitarian” politics by Canadian novelist Allan Stratton.Some have accused critics of bullyingBoyne, and compromising freedom of speech and expression. But we have not called for his books to be pulped, and evidently he has, and continues to be, more than free to share whatever views he likes and write as many books as he wants.Boyne has sinceissued a statementoutlining his views on trans rights and calling on the writers who have withdrawn their nominations to restore themselves to the longlist, writing that he has “shelves full of awards at home” and that while he would not withdraw, he would ask the judges not to shortlist him. Perhaps some writers will take up this offer. But from where I stand, the response is not for Boyne to propose, as this action is not specifically about him – it is about Polari as an institution.Where does it go from here? This year’s prizes are still going ahead and a “shortlist” will still, somehow, be forged from the depleted pool of authors (PEN America, under similar circumstances, had the good sense to cancel its awards). Polari has also said it will be “undertaking a full review of the prize processes”, to avoid the “hurt and anger” caused by this year’s awards. I do wonder what that will look like. Poring through the public statements of all authors to ensure that nothing offending has been said? I can only hope that whatever processes are put in place will be sufficient to secure the confidence of the queer writers who have found themselves having to weather abuse and hostility for taking a public stand.Mostly, though, I think – with or without Boyne’s nomination – Polari needs to figure out what it wants to be. If it wants to be a prize that is inclusive of trans-exclusionary views and writers, it is free to do this and must accept that large swaths of the community will find this intolerable and disengage.I suspect that this reluctance to commit is exactly because of that. As the response to this boycott has shown, the swell of public support is behind those who are supportive of the entire LGBTQ+ community. At one time, Polari seemed to recognise this: Bindel herselfhasnoted that in 2021, after “the trans train had chugged into town”, she was told by its organisers that her presence at an event would cause “a major pushback”. Polari finds itself at another crossroads, called upon to tell us what kind of organisation it is and where it really stands. Perhaps bridges will be rebuilt and the community will return, or we will go off and build something else.Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the Guardian.

But were the 90s as blissful as we remember?Rhiannon Lucy CosslettFri 15 Aug 2025 10.00 EDTShareWhen I look back on my 1990s childhood, it’s hard not to feel nostalgic. We roamed for miles without supervision, riding our bikes, building dens and swimming in streams. After school, we did crafts or played board games and, though the internet existed, my parents would boot me off to use the landline. Media was tangible – tapes, CDs, VHS – and often consumed as a family. I still recall the thrill of going to the video shop to choose a film.It’s normal to feel like this, especially once you have babies of your own, and the social media algorithms know it. In the three years since I had my son and started writing the Guardian’sRepublic of Parenthood column, I’ve noticed a huge upswing of interest in “90s parenting” and, this year, the trend seems to have exploded. Former 90s kids are in the thick of it, trying to work out how to parent our own children. There’s a feeling that huge advances in technology have resulted in a commensurate loss. But what of? Is it possible to get it back? And was parenting really better back then?“Yes. Full stop,” says Justin Flom, a father of two and content creator based in Las Vegas, whobuilt a replica Blockbuster video storefor his daughters in one of the rooms of his house. “The whole family would pile into the car, head to the video store and roam the aisles while deciding what to watch,” he says of his own childhood. “It felt exciting, full of possibility. Scrolling online just isn’t the same.” There’s something about going to a physical place to choose a film together, as well as the anticipation and the delayed gratification when finally watching, that made it feel like an event. “Everyone remembers that blue and yellow sign, the carpet, the ritual of choosing a movie together.”Some parents are giving their kids landlines, creating a retro bubble of resistance against screensNot everyone has the space or the budget to do what Justin has, but the reasoning underpinning his decision would be familiar to many. “As a parent, I’m constantly guarding my children against content I don’t think is good for their brains,” he says. “We prefer older movies and shows, partly because I think the pacing is healthier. They’re not as chaotic or overstimulating.” His girls love the Home Alone movies, Harriet the Spy and Dennis the Menace, and their current favourite is George of the Jungle. Like Justin, I have been drawn towards 1990s media for my son. Current favourites are Pooh’s Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin and Teletubbies, which were both made in 1997 and are a welcome contrast to the frenetic speed of more modern shows.Justin’s Blockbuster room is a way of making screen time intentional, and that seems to be at the heart of this idea of 90s parenting. “In the 90s, the critique was that TV would rot your brain, but it was stationary,” he says. “It lived in your living room. Now, media follows us everywhere. It’s in our pockets, on demand, nonstop. In my house, we work hard to compartmentalise media. It happens at a specific time and in a specific place. That’s part of what made Blockbuster special: it was a destination.”View image in fullscreenComposite: Getty ImagesWith increasing fears about the effects of screen time, and parent-led campaigns such asSmartphone Free Childhoodgaining popularity, it’s no surprise so many of us are looking back to the era just before they exploded. Some parents –and schools– are even giving their children landlines. Agroup of parentsin South Portland in the US has done it so their kids can call each other, creating a “retro bubble” of resistance against screens. Scrolling through 90s parenting-themed reels on Instagram (I’m aware of the irony), I’m struck bya videoof a group of adults and kids having a back garden water fight (organised via landline, of course), having put all their smartphones in a bowl on top of a high cupboard. It takes me back to a time when we weren’t stuck behind screens and our summers often saw all the neighbourhood kids engaged in huge water fights. It was when the mums joined in – coming out with a bucket or washing up bowl so you knew they meant business – that you’d get really excited.Jess Russell is a big believer in the importance of play. A former primary school teacher and special needs coordinator, Jess is now a stay-at-home mum to two children, aged one and three, and uses her Instagram account@playideasforlittlesto campaign for more learning through play in the curriculum. “I grew up in the countryside, and we were outside all the time. My mum was a stay-at-home mum. We’d do lots of arts and crafts at home,” she says. She’s trying to replicate this with her own children by giving them a slower pace of life, with lots of time in the garden and playing board games such as Hungry Hungry Hippos, and only watching TV as a family.Long stretches of unremarkable time were a gift I didn’t know I’d miss, and I want that for my kids. I don’t want to schedule every hour of their livesOne of the reasons Jess left teaching was because she was disillusioned by the direction of education, away from play-based fun towards a more results-driven system. She feels lucky to be able to stay at home to look after her children – which was far more common in the 90s, when you didn’t always need two incomes to cover housing costs. I feel the same about working part-time, and wonder if 90s nostalgia is partly to do with modern parents having to work all hours to keep their heads above water, when they’d like more time with their kids and for it to be playful.It’s not just about screens, I realise, it’s about connection, family time and, actually, time more generally. “Parenting in the 90s was basically just ‘slow’ parenting,” says Jess. That means not ferrying kids from activity to activity so days are jam-packed. Boredom is important, says Melanie Murphy, a mother of two from Dublin, who describes herself as“your nostalgic millennial mum friend” on Instagram. “Long stretches of unremarkable time were a gift I didn’t know I’d miss, and I want that for my kids. I don’t want to schedule every hour of their lives. I don’t want their lives to go by while their eyes are fixed on a device inches from their faces.”View image in fullscreenComposite: Getty ImagesIt is when her children, aged two and four, are bored, says Melanie, that their imaginations really take over. “They’ll build forts, the floor will be lava, underneath the table will become a dragon’s den. We go outside in old clothes and get filthy looking for bugs. They’ll ‘help me’ cook the dinner and clean the house … We play music and have dance parties. We watch my old DVDs on a projector. We colour and paint for hours and read lots of books. Treasure hunts, picnics, making a mess, simple conversations. My husband and I have pulled back on structured activities, adult-led plans and screen time, and as a result our house constantly looks like a bomb has dropped, but the kids are happy so we don’t care.”No doubt some 90s kids will laugh bitterly reading that.One funny videoabout 90s childhoods describes them as following your mum around changing rooms and having your hair cut in the kitchen, both experiences I can identify with. When I ask a friend if she mothers like a 90s parent, or knows anyone who does, she replies: “Hmmm … as in sleep training, lots of TV and Crispy Pancakes?”What I long for isn’t a time machine, but a nice blend: the laid-back spirit of 90s parenting with the emotional awareness and knowledge we have todayShe has a point. Every 90s parenting proponent I speak to, though, is well aware of the danger of rose‑tinted spectacles (round ones with wire frames, naturally). I ask Melanie which aspects of the 90s she might want to leave in the past. “The physical discipline. Being taught to ‘toughen up’ instead of allowing emotions to pass through the body as they’re meant to,” she says, also citing sleep training and the ‘naughty step’. The list goes on: “Secondhand smoke everywhere. The neglect of mental health … Gender stereotyping was off the charts, so was diet culture and UPF (ultra-processed foods) culture.” Her mum was in WeightWatchers, and Melanie used to binge on Pop-Tarts, then try to “undo” the snacks with sit-ups. That can all stay in the past. She also points out not all families were watching films together. In some, there was “little to no supervision of media consumption” and the children would see some incredibly inappropriate and traumatic content.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In my own case, though, I look back wistfully on how “free range” I was as a child. Justin’s experience was similar. “My parents didn’t always know where I was and that was OK,” he says. “I got hurt sometimes. Kids used to break their arms sometimes. And then we learned not to do the thing that broke our arm.” (I did indeed break my arm.)View image in fullscreenComposite: Getty Images“That kind of risk-taking is important. It’s how kids learn judgment. These days, we bubble-wrap childhood so tightly that we’re taking those lessons away,” he says. There has been too much of an overcorrection, he thinks, and people “are longing for something a little looser, a little more analogue. Parenting that’s not ruled by fear.”In other words, we are looking to redress the balance. “We know so much more now – about emotions, neurodiversity, safeguarding, food – and that’s obviously a good thing,” says Melanie. “What I long for isn’t a time machine, but a nice blend: the laid-back spirit of 90s parenting with the emotional awareness and knowledge we have today.”I thought it was worth talking to someone who actually was a parent in the 90s about it, so Jess put me in touch with her mum, Lynn. “I had precious time with my children and I really value that,” she says of their long days spent outdoors, at home or with friends. She points out that shops used to be closed on a Sunday, and the simple joy of that being a day for family. “Today’s parents are craving that simplicity in family time.View image in fullscreenComposite: Getty Images“We lived in a two-bedroom house, and I had a rubbish car … Now people feel as if they have to sustain this standard of living. I feel really sorry for them, because there’s just too much pressure.” I ask Lynn if there is anything that is better now, and she struggles to think of anything. “I really admire mums nowadays because you’re balancing so much. I just didn’t have that. It was really quite straightforward.”I’ll confess that when I first encountered the concept of 90s parenting, I thought it was a bit of a sentimental gimmick, driven by ageing millennials in thrall to social media algorithms. But if that is the case then why, writing this, do I feel so … sad? Perhaps the combined pressures of childcare and working, not to mention exhaustion (my son hasn’t been sleeping) are making me feel wobbly, but I suddenly feel close to tears thinking about choosing a VHS in the local Spar, even though that film was Scream (1996) and my mum made us turn it off. I can’t quite seem to shake this feeling of loss, and of wanting to return to a simpler time. Maybe I just need more fun in my life. Time for a water fight, I think.

The label was reversed before the man was attacked, one of the sources said.Earlier this week,Israel killed the Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif and three colleaguesin their makeshift newsroom, after claiming Sharif was a Hamas commander. The killings focused global attention on the extreme dangers faced by Palestinian journalists in Gaza and Israel’s efforts to manipulate media coverage of the war.Foreign reporters have been barred from entering Gaza apart from a few brief and tightly controlled trips with the Israeli military, who impose restrictions including a ban on speaking to Palestinians.Palestinian journalists reporting from the ground are the most at risk in the world, with more than 180 killed by Israeli attacks in less than two years, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Israel carried out 26 targeted killings of journalists in that period, the CPJ said, describing them as murders.Israel has produced an unconvincing dossier of unverified evidence on Sharif’s purported Hamas links, and failed to address how he would have juggled a military command role with regular broadcast duties in one of the most heavily surveilled places on Earth. Israel did not attempt to justify killing his three colleagues.Before the attack, press freedom groups and Sharif himself had warned that Israeli accusations of Hamas links, first made in 2024, were designed to “manufacture consent to kill”. They had been revived and repeated with increasing frequency after his reporting on famine in Gaza went viral.Intelligence sources told +972 magazine that the “legitimisation cell” worked to undermine the work done by Palestinian journalists as well as their protected status under international law.Officers were eager to find a media worker they could link to Hamas, because they were convinced Gaza-based journalists were “smearing [Israel’s] name in front of the world”, a source was quoted saying.In at least one case, they misrepresented evidence to falsely claim a reporter was an undercover militant, two sources said, although the designation was reversed before an attack was ordered.“They were eager to label him as a target, as a terrorist, to say it’s OK to attack him,” one recalled. “They said: during the day he’s a journalist, at night he’s a platoon commander. Everyone was excited. But there was a chain of errors and corner-cutting.”“In the end, they realised he really was a journalist,” the source added, and the reporter was taken off the target list.Israel’s government often gave the army orders about where the unit should focus their work, and the primary motive of the “legitimisation cell” was public relations, not national security, the sources said.When media criticism of Israel over a particular issue intensified the cell would be tasked with finding intelligence that could be declassified and used to counter the narrative, the magazine reported.“If the global media is talking about Israel killing innocent journalists, then immediately there’s a push to find one journalist who might not be so innocent, as if that somehow makes killing the other 20 acceptable,” the article quoted an intelligence source saying.The cell also reportedly sought information on Hamas’s use of schools and hospitals for military purposes, and failed attacks by Palestinian armed groups that harmed civilians there.Some in the unit were reportedly concerned about publishing classified material for public relations reasons rather than military or security objectives. Officers were told their work was crucial to Israel’s ability to keep fighting, one source said.“The idea was to (allow the military to) operate without pressure, so countries like America wouldn’t stop supplying weapons,” a second source said. “Anything that could bolster Israel’s international legitimacy to keep fighting.”The IDF has been approached for comment.On Friday, at least 16 Palestinians were killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza, including five who were trying to get food aid, medical sources told Al Jazeera.Israel also issued evacuation orders for northern parts of Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighbourhood, as it intensified military operations before a planned escalation of the ground war in Gaza, which has been widely criticised domestically and abroad.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warJournalist safetyWar reportingGazaPress freedomNewspapers & magazinesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The party said there had been no discussions about alternative candidates at any NEC meetings and no proposals put to NEC members about a selection process.Abbott said: “It does seem to be rather pre-empting the results of the investigation.”One figure on the left of the party said talk of replacing Abbott risked inflaming tensions between the leadership and grassroots members. “There’s no appetite among members for a stitch-up, they would want this to be fair after everything that’s happened,” they said.Abbott, who as the longest-serving female MP has the honorary title of mother of the house,lost the Labour whipin autumn 2023 after she wrote a letter to the Observer in which she argued that Jewish, Irish and Traveller people did not experience racism in the same way as Black people and likened their experience to that of people with red hair.Abbott said the letter published was a draft version, and that her comments had been taken out of context. She was readmitted to the party in time to retain her seat at the general election, but wassuspended again last monthafter telling the BBC in an interview that she did not regret the remarks.The Guardian understands that potential successors to Abbott include those who were in the frame to replace before general election, among them the London assembly member Sem Moema and the Hackney councillor Mete Coban.Abbott’s latest suspension caused unease among some party insiders, including NEC members, but they said her decision to repeat her original comments, despite previously apologising, made it harder for them to defend her.Labour sources have briefed that Abbott is unlikely to be readmitted to the parliamentary Labour party. It is thought that she plans to stand down at the next election, if not sooner. Sources close to the process said discussions about a potential successor are too important to be left to the last minute.Under party rules, a suspended MP is barred from standing as a candidate until their case is resolved. The NEC has the power to trigger a selection process if a sitting MP is not endorsed to stand again.The row over Abbott’s future comes as Labour prepares for its autumn conference.The disciplinary process over Abbott’s original Observer letter became one of the longest and most prominent internal rows of Keir Starmer’s leadership. Allies accused party leaders of deliberately dragging their feet to prevent her re-selection, while Labour HQ insisted the investigation was handled according to the rules.The seat is regarded as ultra-safe for Labour, even although her majority last year was halved to 15,000 last year amid a challenge from the Greens.Explore more on these topicsDiane AbbottLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Extreme emotions will accompany the champions throughout their title defence but were particularly apt on the night Anfield paid tribute to Diogo Jota and Arne Slot’s side showed the incredible will-to-win that defines them.Mohamed Salah was inconsolable after the final whistle. Moments after sealing an enthralling victory over Bournemouth and recreating Jota’s Baby Shark celebration, the Liverpool forward broke down in tears in front of the Kop as they sang inhonour of the tragic Portugal international. Jota’s wife, Rute Cardoso, children and family had found the strength to be present and were welcomed with a sign that read: ‘Rute, Dinis, Duarte, Matilda – Anfield will always be your home. You’ll Never Walk Alone.’ It was one moving moment among many as Anfield remembered their number 20 and his brother, André Silva, following their deaths in July.Liverpool 4-2 Bournemouth: Premier League season opener – liveRead moreThe headlines could have belonged to Federico Chiesa, who came off the bench to clinch the win and shatterBournemouthwith an 88th-minute volley. It was his first Premier League goal for the club but, given the emotion, the high drama and unfortunately allegations of racist abuse towards Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, Chiesa’s vital contribution may be overlooked. Semenyo scored two excellent goals to haul Andoni Iraola’s team level, and deservedly so, only for Chiesa’s and Salah’s late double act to rescue Liverpool.Hugo Ekitiké,Liverpool’s recent £69m signingfrom Eintracht Frankfurt, impressed on his Premier League debut and opened the scoring. His touch, movement and pace ensured a seamless assimilation into the Liverpool attack but one look at Slot’s substitute bench, where his striking options consisted of Chiesa and 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha, underlined why interest in Alexander Isak remains. For all the additions to the Liverpool ranks and departures from the Bournemouth squad, however, it was the visitors who looked the more enterprising team prior to Ekitiké’s breakthrough.Bournemouth have sold Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi to the powerhouses ofLiverpool, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain respectively this summer for a combined £144.8m. Their absences told defensively, but Iraola will take comfort from the quality of his side’s overall display.Marcos Senesi was fortunate in the extreme to avoid a red card for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity with 13 minutes gone. Attempting to intercept a pass intended for Ekitiké, the Bournemouth central defender miscued a clearance from his thigh on to his fingertips before clawing the ball away from the Liverpool striker, who would have been through on goal. It was a clear handball, so clear that Cody Gakpo picked up the ball to await the inevitable punishment. Instead, referee Anthony Taylor awarded Bournemouth a free-kick for a handball by Gakpo. It was some escape.Slot was further enraged when Taylor waved play on after a trip on Florian Wirtz. Semenyo took possession and avoided a dangerous challenge from Kerkez before being tripped by Alexis Mac Allister. Moments later, as the Bournemouth forward shaped to take a throw-in, a Liverpool fan moved to the front of the Main Stand and berated him. Semenyo informed Taylor he had been racially abused and the game was paused as the match official called over both managers and stewards. The fan, in a wheelchair, was escorted out of the stadium at half-time by three police officers.View image in fullscreenHugo Ekitiké pays tribute to Diogo Jota after scoring Liverpool’s first-half opener.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesEkitiké gave Liverpool the lead shortly after the depressing incident when, having exchanged passes with Mac Allister, he ran at Senesi and benefited from a ricochet off the defender to race through on goal. The France under-21 international was coolness personified as he sent Djordje Petrovic to his right and rolled a finish past the keeper’s left. Gakpo doubled the champions’ advantage early in the second half when he received Ekitiké’s pass on the edge of the area and cut across two Bournemouth players before finding the bottom corner.Liverpool were in the comfort zone, and Bournemouth almost made them pay. Semenyo twice punished loose defending – and it had been a feature of their entire performance – to haul the visitors level. The Ghana international was unmarked as he swept home David Brooks’ low centre from the left. There was a sense of inevitability about Bournemouth’s equaliser and it arrived when Salah overhit a pass towards Dominik Szoboszlai. Hamed Traorè intercepted and released Semenyo, who set off from deep inside his own half and did not meet a challenge of note until reaching the edge of the Liverpool penalty area. The forward ended his outstanding run by finding the bottom corner of Alisson’s goal.How Salah made amends. It was his cross that caused pandemonium inside the Bournemouth box and resulted in Chiesa volleying Liverpool back in front. In stoppage time Salah registered his customary opening day goal to put the result beyond doubt with a piercing finish beyond Petrovic. The Egypt international celebrated wildly by his standards. The tears that followed underlined the importance of this night to all at Liverpool.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

By 2010, London had a higher proportion of schools rated as good or outstanding by Ofsted than any other area of England.The initial phase of Rise began earlier this year, after 600 schools were identified as urgently needing support. More than 200 were matched with advisers and partners, and must create an approved plan for transformation before receiving up to £200,000 in extra funding spread over two years.The DfE said a further 200 schools would be added “very quickly” in the autumn, when the new school year commences, as a sign of the government’s recognition of the urgency.Collins said: “The emphasis [of Rise] is all about pace, because the one thing about schools that start to decline, the slide becomes embedded. They can’t recruit great staff, people start leaving, attitudes become habitual. You need to be radical to turn that around, and the longer you leave it, the harder it is. This is what is so shameful about these schools being left like this for so long.”He added: “One of the things about the London Challenge was that it was very high-profile and with a sense of endeavour – everyone was leaning into it, it had massive national leadership. There was a big effort, a clear effort, and that is what we are trying to replicate with Rise.”Jon Coles, the director of the London Challenge when it launched under the leadership of Tim Brighouse, and who is now the chief executive of the United Learning academy trust, said: “The history of the London Challenge shows that you can make a big difference, that these things are not inevitable.“Twenty years ago, inner London performed less well than every region in the country. And now the only place that outperforms inner London is outer London.“So things can change. But it requires people to decide they are going to work together, have a great strategy, take tough decisions, collaborate beyond boundaries, in order to make things better for children.”Thursday’s A-level results showed the gap between the best- and worst-performing regions widened again this year, with 32% of entries in London gaining the top A* or A grades, compared with fewer than 23% in north-east England.Young people in the north-east of England are also less likely to takeA-levelsthan their peers in London and the south-east. Research published by the DfE in July showed that more than half of children in inner London eligible for free school meals at the age of 15 went on to higher education by the age of 19, compared with 22% in the north-east and the east Midlands.Explore more on these topicsSchoolsBridget PhillipsonDepartment for EducationA-levelsSocial mobilityEducation policyEnglandShareReuse this content"

It’s about to spend hundreds of billions moreRead more“At Neil Young’s request, we are no longer using Facebook for any Neil Young related activities,” Reprise Records announced. “Meta’s use of chatbots with children is unconscionable. Mr. Young does not want a further connection with Facebook.”The report also has generated a response from US lawmakers.Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, launched an investigation into the company Friday, writing in a letter to Mark Zuckerberg that he would investigate “whether Meta’s generative-AI products enable exploitation, deception, or other criminal harms to children, and whether Meta misled the public or regulators about its safeguards”. Republican senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said she supports an investigation into the company.Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, called the policies “deeply disturbing and wrong”, adding that section 230, a law that shields internet companies from liability for the content posted to their platforms, should not protect companies’ generative AI chatbots.“Meta and Zuckerberg should be held fully responsible for any harm these bots cause,” he said.On Thursday, Reuters published an article about internal Meta policy documents that detailed ways in which chatbots are allowed to generate content. Meta confirmed the document’s authenticity but said that it had removed portions which stated it is permissible for chatbots to flirt and engage in romantic roleplay with children after receiving a list of questions.According to Meta’s 200-page internal policy seen by Reuters, titled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards”, the controversial rules for chatbots were approved by Meta’s legal, public policy and engineering staff, including its chief ethicist.The document defines what Meta staff and contractors should treat as acceptable chatbot behaviors when building and training the company’s generative AI products but says that the standards do not necessarily reflect “ideal or even preferable” generative AI outputs.The policy document said it would be acceptable for a bot to tell a shirtless eight-year-old that “every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply” but it also limits what Reuters described as “sexy talk”.The document states, for example, that “it is unacceptable to describe a child under 13 years old in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable”, including phrases like “soft rounded curves invite my touch”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although chatbots are prohibited from having such conversations with minors, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said, he acknowledged that the company’s enforcement was inconsistent.Meta is planning to spend around $65bn on AI infrastructure this year part of a broader strategy to become a leader in artificial intelligence.The head-long rush into AI comes by tech giants come with complex questions over limitations and standards over how, with what information, and with whom, AI chatbots are allowed to engage with users.Reuters also reported on Fridaythat a cognitively impaired New Jersey man grew infatuated with “Big sis Billie”, a Facebook Messenger chatbot with a young woman’s persona. Thongbue “Bue” Wongbandue, 76, reportedly packed up his belongings to visit “a friend” in New York in March. The so-called friend turned out to be a generative artificial intelligence chatbot that had repeatedly reassured the man she was real and had invited him to her apartment, even providing an address.But Wongbandue fell near a parking lot on his way to New York, injuring his head and neck. After three days on life support, he was pronounced dead on 28 March.Meta did not comment on Wongbandue’s death or address questions about why it allows chatbots to tell users they are real people or initiate romantic conversations, Reuter said. The company did, however, say that Big sis Billie “is not Kendall Jenner and does not purport to be Kendall Jenner”, referencing a partnership with the reality TV star.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyArtificial intelligence (AI)MetanewsShareReuse this content"

Sharia had saved people from “corruption, oppression, usurpation, drugs, theft, robbery, and plunder”, he said.“These are great divine blessings that our people should not forget and, during the commemoration of Victory Day, express great gratitude to Allah Almighty so that the blessings will increase,” Akhundzada said in comments shared on X.“If, against God’s will, we fail to express gratitude for blessings and are ungrateful for them, we will be subjected to the severe punishment of Allah Almighty,” he said.ICC issues warrant for Taliban’s supreme leader for persecution of womenRead moreLast month, the international criminal court issued arrest warrants for Akhundzada and the chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, accusing them ofcrimes against humanityfor the persecution of women and girls.The ICC said there were “reasonable grounds to believe” they had ordered policies that deprived women and girls of “education, privacy and family life and the freedoms of movement, expression, thought, conscience and religion”.This year’s anniversary celebrations are more muted than last year’s, when the Taliban staged a military parade at a US airbase, drawing anger from Donald Trump about the abandoned American hardware on display.Afghanistan is also gripped by a humanitarian crisis made worse by the climate crisis, millions of Afghansexpelled from Iranand Pakistan, and a sharp drop in donor funding.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanTalibanSouth and central AsiaWomennewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t think they’re far off. I stood there thinking: ‘Who do I ring to tell them?’ But I thought no one was going to believe me.”Wallabies are native to Australia but small wild populations descended from escapers do exist in the UK and sightings have become more common, especially in the Isle of Man.Ellis’s encounter on Tuesday was not to be the last. Suffolk police received a call of another sighting the next day about seven miles away. The animal hopped from the road into a field just outside the village of Wissett.A spokesperson for Suffolk police said that despite the brief flurry of attention no further sightings had been confirmed, and no individual or organisation had come forward to claim ownership of the animal.Police are asking the public to report any sightings directly to them.Occasional escapes from private collections have been documented in recent years. Wallabies are generally considered not dangerous to humans, but they can be unpredictable and should be treated with caution.Those hand-reared or accustomed to human presence can be gentle, but others can be easily startled, especially if they feel threatened.Explore more on these topicsSuffolkAnimalsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The dolphin bobbed in and out of the water, playfully engaging them and receiving belly rubs.Though the interaction appeared jovial and harmless, the MMO has issued a strict warning that such encounters “can harm dolphins leading to injury, death, or aggression”, urging the public to keep its distance.The MMO said the public should “never swim with, touch, feed, or approach dolphins. If a dolphin approaches you, calmly leave the area.”“Human interaction can cause dolphins to lose their natural wariness, leading to injury or even death,” the agency added. “Disturbed dolphins are also known to become aggressive toward people.“Dolphins may seem friendly, but they are wild animals. The dolphin in Lyme Bay has already been injured by a suspected boat propeller,” the MMO said. “Let’s protect them by keeping our distance and please share this message to respect their space.”Could giving this pod of dolphins the same legal rights as humans help keep them safe?Read moreWhale and Dolphin Conservation, a charity dedicated to protecting wild dolphins and whales, says dolphins can be disturbed not only by jetskis and motorboats but any intrusive human interaction. When people encounter dolphins, the WDC advises keeping a safe distance, leaving after about 15 minutes, and ensuring no more than two boats are within 300 metres of a group of dolphins.According to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, 28 different species of whales, dolphins and porpoises have been recorded in UK waters – including four types of dolphin: bottlenose, common, Risso’s and white-beaked. There are an estimated 700 bottlenose dolphins living off the UK’s shores.They can be encountered fairly regularly off the British coast, potentially coming into contact with swimmers or people sailing, interactions that can cause the animals harm.Explore more on these topicsDolphinsDorsetWildlifeMarine lifeEnglandCetaceansAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Israel Meteorological Service said the highest temperature recorded on Wednesday was 49.7C in Gilgal kibbutz, a settlement in the occupied West Bank, setting a historical record in the Jordan Valley.Aqaba, a port on the Red Sea, broke Jordan’s national heat record with a daytime maximum of 49.6C.Temperatures in Gaza were cooler but still soared above 40C. Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinians, said on Thursday the heat was “making an already desperate situation far worse” by increasing dehydration.

Recent data has shown the proportion of gen Z – those born roughly between 1997 and 2012 – who are of legal drinking age and have consumed alcohol in the past six months has increased by 7% between 2024 and 2025.Alcopops are apparently all the rage among gen Z customers, withbooming sales of Smirnoff Ice, Bacardi Breezers and BuzzBallz, while last year’s“brat summer” was said to herald the end of the clean-living era.The reality, experts say, is more complicated.“We’re seeing a generational recalibration, not a simple return to hedonism,” said Ivo Vlaev, a professor of behavioural science at Warwick University. “This isn’t a simple return to the past – it’s a complex blend of coping, compensation, identity expression and socioeconomic constraint. The behaviours may look familiar, but the psychology behind them has evolved.”He said the fact that gen Z came of age during a pandemic, climate crisis and increased concerns over the cost of living was a recipe for “psychological whiplash”.Key factors at play included a rebound from the restrictions of the Covid era with young people now “reasserting agency through social behaviours”.Vlaev said research showed that “when autonomy is suppressed, people later overcompensate with behaviours that signal freedom or control”. There was also an element of “self-soothing” as a result of rising levels of anxiety, depression and loneliness, as well as the glamorisation of certain drinks and behaviours on TikTok.Financial concerns may have also pushed the younger generation towards “present-biased decision-making”.“When the future feels unstable, people are less likely to invest in long-term health and more likely to seek short-term mood boosts, like alcohol or late nights out,” he said.Vlaev also said an element of “wellness culture” fatigue had probably set in. “Some gen-Zers are pushing back against the pressure to optimise every aspect of life,” he said.Richard Halstead, chief operation officer of consumer research at drinks market analysis company IWSR, said: “From a consumer research and data point of view, it does seem there is some pushback on this idea that we’re all perfect, having perfect pictures taken of us on Instagram and we’re all super in control of our lives.“Every cultural move has a countercultural move associated with it.”He said gen Z’s attitude towards drinking and socialising was more nuanced than is often portrayed in the media – gen Z were not “puritans” who abstain from alcohol, but nor did they like booze as much as previous generations.“The idea that gen Z do not drink at all or that they have turned their backs on alcohol is not supported by data,” he said. “The idea that they have a different relationship with alcohol compared to previous generations is supported by data.”He said that, for instance, gen Z were more likely to drink a wider variety of alcohol, and drink out in bars and restaurants.“Their pattern of behaviour is actually going out for a reason, as opposed to just meeting for a pint in the pub because the pub’s there and you’ve got nothing better to do,” he said.Dr Laura Tinner, a research fellow at the Centre for PublicHealthat the University of Bristol, said people should not underestimate the power of the alcohol companies themselves, keen to capture a younger audience they feared they were losing.“It’s not necessarily that there has been a swing in the pendulum or a return to previous drinking behaviours, it’s more that alcohol companies are continually trying to target young people with their products,” she said. “They are using the current revival and zeitgeist around 00s and 90s culture to design their products to target young people.”There was also a suggestion that gen Z were simply older – they are now roughly between the ages of 13 and 28 – so those at the older end of the group were more likely to have access to well paid jobs and disposable income.“I think we’re seeing some tailwinds develop,” said Halstead. “They’re getting older so some are probably in better paying, stable jobs and they’ve got more opportunity perhaps to do things that people with a bit more money like to do, which is go out and buy a drink and not worry too much about how much it costs you.”What many researchers were interested in was whether the characteristics that make gen Z different from their predecessors will stay with them as they age, with evidence suggesting generations become more and more similar as they get older.“We’ve always had a question about whether or not the decline [in drinking alcohol] will persist into adulthood,” said Dr Laura Fenton, a research associate at the University of Sheffield who specialises in youth drinking cultures.“What makes gen Z slightly distinct as a generation is their attitude towards risk. They’ve engaged in fewer [risky pursuits] proportionally compared to people their age 20 years ago – and that extends to sex, it extends to driving, it extends to smoking and drug use,” she said.“I think the question really is, is their approach to risk going to stay intact?”Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleAlcoholHealthFood & drink industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it is not kickboxing prowess that concludes the match. It is an attempted roundhouse kick that squarely misses its target, sending the kickboxer from a top university team tumbling to the floor.While traditional kickboxing comes with the risk of blood, sweat and serious head injuries, the competitors in Friday’s match at the inaugural World Humanoid Robot Games in Beijing faced a different set of challenges. Balance, battery life and a sense of philosophical purpose being among them.The kickboxers, pint-sized humanoid robots entered by teams from leading Chinese technological universities, are part of a jamboree of humanoid events taking place at China’s latest technology event. After spectators in the 12,000-seater National Speed Skating Oval, built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, stood for the Chinese national anthem on Friday morning, the government-backed games began.“I came here out of curiosity,” said Hong Yun, a 58-year-old retired engineer, sat in the front row. Seeing the robots race was “much more exciting than seeing real humans”, Hong added.View image in fullscreenRobots compete in a five-a-side football match on the first day of the World Humanoid Robot Games in Beijing on Friday.Photograph: Tingshu Wang/ReutersThe games put on display China’s prowess in humanoid robotics, a technological field that has been pushed to the forefront of the country’s artificial intelligence industry. The hype machine is in full swing.As well as kickboxing, humanoids participated in athletics,footballand dance competitions. One robot had to drop out of the 1500-metre because its head flew off partway round the course. “Keeping [the head] balanced while in movement is the biggest challenge for us,” said Wang Ziyi, a 19-year-old student from Beijing Union University, who was part of the team that entered the robot.Ever since a troupe of humanoid dancing robots took the stage at the 2025 Spring Festival Gala, a televised lunar new year’s celebration viewed nearly 17bn times online, Beijing has been enthusiastically pushing the adoption of “embodied AI” – an industry that wassingled out in this year’s government work reportin March.View image in fullscreenOne robot had to drop out of the 1500m partway because its head flew off.Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty ImagesThe social-media-friendly events reflect a more serious geopolitical reality: an intensifying US-Chinatechnological competitionthat could reshape the frontiers of AI.The technology has become a lightning rod forrelations between the two countries. And while the US still has the lead on frontier research, owing in part to Washington’s restrictions on the export of cutting-edge chips to China, Beijing is going all-in on real life applications, such as robotics.Several cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, have established 10bn yuan (£1bn) robotics industry funds. In January, the state-owned Bank of China announced plans for a 1tn yuan of financial support to the AI industry over the next five years.“If there is an area where [Beijing] thinks that China is ahead, or could be positioned as a world leader, then they really want to draw attention to that area,” said Dr Kyle Chan, a researcher at Princeton University.View image in fullscreenA robot is carried off after a kickboxing match on the first day of the games.Photograph: China News Service/Getty ImagesThere is something strangely ominous about seeing jerky, human-like robots with two arms, two legs, and blank heads being dragged out of the ring to be recharged by their human handlers.When it comes to humanoids, the Chinese industry has many advantages. Although US companies such as Tesla and Boston Dynamicsare still seen as the overall market leaders, several Chinese firms such as UBTech and Unitree Robotics – which supplied the boxing robots in Friday’s games – are catching up.Tesla relies on China for many of the parts needed to build the company’s physical humanoids. The US investment bank Morgan Stanley estimates that China-based supply chains produce robots at a third of the cost of non-China suppliers. “It appears to be very difficult to entirely decouple from China in this space,” wrote Sheng Zhong, the bank’s head of China industrials research, in a recent note.View image in fullscreenA robot built by the Chinese company Unitree Robotics plays a traditional drum.Photograph: Tingshu Wang/ReutersAs well as generating positive publicity on social media, China views humanoids as being part of the solution to the problems created by the country’s ageing population and shrinking workforce. A recent article in People’s Daily, a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist party, said robots could offer practical and emotional support for older people. “The vision of robot-assisted elderly care is not far away,” it said. Humanoid robots could also take the place of employees on factory lines as China tries to retrain and redeploy its workforce into more hi-tech jobs.But for all the hype, there is a big gap between humanoids stumbling over footballs and reliably handling daily tasks. Safely interacting with vulnerable humans would be another leap. “The home is probably one of the last places you’ll ever find a humanoid robot because of safety,” said Chan. “My general view on the whole humanoid explosion … is honestly a bit of scepticism.”View image in fullscreenA technician works on humanoid robots on the sidelines of the games.Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty ImagesTwo of the biggest barriers to the technology being useful outside of PR stunts are the complexity of the human-built environment and the hands needed to navigate it.While other forms of AI, such as large language models, can be trained using reams of digital data, there are much smaller datasets available for training an algorithm on how to walk through crowded restaurants or up and down flights of stairs. Although China’s efforts to get robots out into the real world can help companies to harvest more data, it is still a big bottleneck in the industry, Chan said.Dr Jonathan Aitken, a robotics teacher at the University of Sheffield, agreed. “The state of AI is nowhere near seeing humanoids operating out of uncontrolled environments,” he said.And while robots jumping and kicking looks impressive, mundane daily tasks such as handling a kitchen knife or folding laundry requires dexterous hands, a skill technology companies have yet to crack. A human hand has about 27 “degrees of freedom” – ie, independent movements through space. Tesla’s Optimus humanoid, one of the most advanced models on the market, has 22.Still, China has beat the odds before when it comes to turbocharged advances. Just 10 years ago, the country exported fewer than 375,000 cars a year. Now China is the world’s biggest automobile supplier, shipping nearly 6m vehicles annually. The European Union has increased tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles in an attempt to stem the flow.In China, the political and public will is firmly behind the humanoids. Zhan Guangtao came to the humanoid games with her two daughters on Friday, after her elder child’s school gave them free tickets. “It’s good to have my children in touch with the world’s most advanced robotics,” Zhan said. “Exposing them to hi-tech will broaden their horizons.”Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaRobotsArtificial intelligence (AI)Technology sectorComputingAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a candid interview, she talks about her emotionally gruelling time on I Fought the Law – and why she may never do a role like it againFri 15 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareAcommunity hall in north-east England has been hired for the afternoon to film a scene for one of the standout TV dramas of this year. However, it is off screen – in the cramped kitchen of the building near Hartlepool – that I am seeing one of the most extraordinary and moving tableaux that can have happened on a TV shoot.Standing before a monitor, Ann Ming, a retired surgical nurse, calmly observesSheridan Smithpretending to be her with the uncanny accuracy of appearance and speech that is the actor’s speciality. The shot cuts to a young woman. At this point, the production team tenses: this character is Julie Hogg, Ming’s daughter, who was murdered, aged 22, in 1989. How might someone in their 70s deal with seeing a double of herself and her lost child?“She looks like her,” says the bereaved mother, matter-of-factly. Such grace in bizarre circumstances will not surprise anyone who watches the ITV four-parter I Fought the Law. It shows Ming dealing first with what police believe to be Julie’s disappearance; then, after 80 days, the discovery of her body in the bathroom of a house forensic cops claimed to have carefully searched for five days. This led to the trial for murder of Billy Dunlop, who was acquitted when two juries could not reach verdicts. When the killer later confessed, he could not be tried again under the 800-year-old “double jeopardy” rule against being tried twice for the same crime. The main focus of the series is Ming’s campaign tooverturn that rule. She did so in 2006 – after 17 years.View image in fullscreenSheridan Smith in I Fought The Law.Photograph: Jay Brooks/ITV“I didn’t slag off police or judges or the government,” says Ming from an on-set trailer labelled “Real Ann”. “I just took it step by step, writing letters. I slept badly because of flashbacks and nightmares and so on. So my husband Charlie would find me in the middle of the night writing to another politician. I thought: ‘I’ve got the biggest mouth. I’m going to carry on.’”Did Ming find that the state relied on her eventually giving up? Much like another case of individuals fighting officialdom that was dramatised by ITV inMr Bates vs the Post Office? “Yes.” So was it stubbornness that kept her going? “No. I think it’s the injustice of it. When I look back, in the 70s, my mam had an argument with the council over her house and I wrote a letter to the secretary of state! And got a reply. So it must always have been in there somewhere. That was my first project.”Her latest is to prevent “him”, Dunlop – like many relatives of murder victims, she refuses to speak the killer’s name – being released on parole or transferred to an open prison: “I know he’ll probablyget out eventuallyand then I’ll have to deal with that. Hopefully it won’t be in my lifetime.”The series is adapted from Ming’s book, For the Love of Julie: “People said for years: ‘Why don’t you write a book?’ and I’d say: ‘It hasn’t got an ending.’ Once he was convicted, I was able to write it and it was cathartic. A ghost writer did the book for me [based on interviews] and I remember getting to the end of the transcript and thinking: ‘Wow, you got through all that and came out the other end.’”The “Real Ann” has a trailer because she is not only the subject of the story but, today, an actor.The scene at the community hall features a line-dancing class, Ming’s distracting pastime, and she cameos as one of the dancers: “I never did it before Julie. And then a friend of mine said: ‘Come on, you need to get out,’ so I started it. When Charlie got Parkinson’s, I couldn’t go for six years. For me it’s two and a half hours when you can’t concentrate on anything except the steps. So I now go five times a week. I wish Julie could have gone because she loved dancing.”During pre-production, she met Smith several times. Real people who have been portrayed on screen have told me they felt the actor studying them to steal gestures and inflections. Did Ming feel Smith doing that? “No! Was she doing that? I gelled to her straight away. I’d seen everything she’d done except for one, which they gave me. That was where Alison Steadman was her mother and she had to care for her after she’d had a stroke [Care, BBC One, 2018]. I had to do that for my husband and watching her was like watching me!”View image in fullscreenA real character  … Smith with Ann Ming.Photograph: Anastasia Arsentyeva/ITVAn audience enthralled by Ann’s agony at not being able to bring her daughter’s killer to justice despite his admission of guilt may wonder why the rule was held sacrosanct for eight centuries. “It’s a good question,” says screenwriter Jamie Crichton. “I spent a lot of time trying to find the most concise explanation of why ‘double jeopardy’ was a good idea. The best anyone offered was that it encouraged police to build the best case possible. If they thought they could keep coming back, they might be sloppy. They still have it in America, Australia, Canada and many other countries.”Having changed the law in the UK, Ming is looking beyond: “This programme – what I’d love is to send a copy to Donald Trump and say: ‘Please be brave – change the double jeopardy law all over America. Why are they frightened? People say it would mean everyone getting a retrial. But there are so many safeguards in the English law. It has to be ‘new and compelling’ evidence. When I was campaigning, someone at the Law Commission said it would only ever apply once in a blue moon. I said: ‘What if that blue moon was your son or your daughter?’”Usually, actors give interviews on set visits when they are not needed for shooting. Smith can’t today as she is in almost every scene. So it is almost a year later that I speak to the actor at the launch of the series. She apologises for “only being able to say hello” during filming but she has no need to be sorry: not only was there the volume of scenes, but almost every moment in the four hours is emotionally fraught. The director, Erik Richter Strand, told her he was amazed by how easily she seemed to find the necessary emotion. Is it simple?“Erik thinks it was,” says Smith. “Because he would say: ‘Now cry!’, ‘Now scream!’ And he got so used to me crying so much that I think he thought it was like a tap. But actually there’s a struggle underneath to get it.” At drama school, aren’t actors taught to be “in the moment”? “Yeah. But I didn’t go to drama school. So I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m blagging it. Really I just try to recreate the trauma the character would have gone through. I could never say: ‘Give me a tear stick and I’ll pretend to cry.’ I have to feel it.”Ming is the latest of several real-life people Smith has played, following Cilla Black inCilla; Charmian Biggs (wife of Great Train Robber Ronnie) inMrs Biggs; Sarah Sak, mother of a murder victim inFour Lives; Julie Bushby, searching for missing schoolgirl Shannon Matthews inThe Moorside; and cancer patient Lisa Lynch inThe C Word. Are these biographical roles policy or just what she is offered?View image in fullscreenFighting for it … Smith with Daniel York Loh as Charlie Ming in I Fought The Law.Photograph: Anastasia Arsentyeva/ITV“Not just professional offers. Lisa Lynch contacted me on Twitter and asked me to play her. I wasn’t conscious of it happening. But I think the time I can really act is when it’s someone’s pain. Whether it’s my pain coming out through the acting I don’t know. But I find doing the make-believe stuff much harder. With Mrs Biggs, I’d remember the night my brother died and my mum screaming so I’d tap into that. Now, as a mum, I imagine what if something happened to your child. So I was relieved to finish the job and get home to my son. But also aware that Ann doesn’t get to go home to her daughter. So the least I could do was go through those nine weeks’ torture. Although I don’t want to sound like a wanky actor. It is just acting, but at the same time I find playing a real person gives me purpose. I love doing comedy and make-believe but there’s something about playing a real person’s story.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And I didn’t realise Ann was watching – I don’t think I could have done it if I had known – until she walked on set and said: ‘It was like you’re in my body.’ And we were both bawling our eyes out. That was the reassurance I needed.”Their relationship, though, was not a complete love-in: “That day you were on set, she saw me smoking and said: ‘Get that cigarette out of your hand,’ and she told me I had too many tattoos.”I have been watching Smith’s work and interviewing her about it for two decades now and have often been alarmed by what these extraordinary emotional performances seem to take out of her. Is there a cost? “Yeah, there is. I think in the past I’ve used acting as therapy. I’m comfortable with this because I know you. But at the photocall today I was shaking. Ann couldn’t believe it. But, having moved up north with my little boy, suddenly coming back to London and having photographers shouting ‘This way, this way’, it’s overwhelming.“Obviously I used to drink and find my way through it that way – but now that I’ve found therapy, got my little boy, I’m sober, doing yoga and meditation, I’m a totally different person. I Fought the Law took it out of me and I’ll be mindful of what jobs I take in the future because I’m in the best place I’ve been. I have to always remember that the real-life characters have actually gone through this but I think a little bit of each character stays in me.”View image in fullscreenSmith as Myrtle in Opening Night.Photograph: Oliver Rosser/Feast CreativeLast year, in the playOpening Nightin London’s West End, she seemed, perhaps riskily, to be putting herself into the character of an actor struggling through a production while drunk, as had seemed to be the case with Smith in the musicalFunny Girlin 2015. Watching a scene in which Smith’s Opening Night character crawls around outside the theatre, I wonder if it was sensible to be doing this to herself?“I know! People offer these jobs and I’m still like the little girl from up north who thinks she’ll never work again.” But you were playing a version of? “Myself! I’ve never been that drunk on stage but, when she’s crawling across the pavement to the theatre, it definitely reflected Funny Girl and having the curtain brought down on me and all that. Doing the part was a way of facing my fears and coming to terms with it. I felt that if I could do that, I could do anything.”Even so, playing Ming has been “the hardest job I have done” and she plans to be more wary of roles that are an empathy decathlon: “I was always going back and forth between drinking and sobriety. But this time I feel it’s for real. I am, though, going to choose my parts very carefully. Sobriety and my son come first, so anything that might knock me off kilter I would be careful of. I go home and look into my little boy’s face and hope that one day he’ll be proud I did these things. With I Fought the Law, he just said: ‘Yukky wig.’ That was his review. Minus five stars. He just kept looking at the photo and laughing.”Smith has just completed The Cage, a lighter and wholly fictional BBC robbery drama but admits she is “ready to do comedy”. In an era of many TV remakes and reboots, some will wonder about the sitcom Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps,in which she appeared with Ralf Little, Natalie Casey, Will Mellor and Kathryn Drysdale in the first decade of this century.“I’d love to do that,” says Smith. “Especially after seeingGavin & Stacey, where they all came back together. I think Two Pints was like our uni for people who didn’t do uni. It would be a reunion with all your pals. I’d do it again in a heartbeat if everyone wanted to.”I Fought the Law is on ITV1 and ITVX on 31 August.Explore more on these topicsSheridan SmithDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Strictly class of 2025 has now been unveiled in full.As always, optimistically rumoured big names failed to materialise. There’s no politician, no newsreader, no minor royal. Stacey Solomon, Rob Brydon, Monica Galetti, Tom Parker-Bowles, Mo Farah and pretty much anyone who’s ever been on The Traitors were all hotly tipped but haven’t transpired. Anyone would think they didn’t want to have their sticky-out bottoms and sticky-up thumbs critiqued in front of millions.So which 15 celebrities (we deploy the term loosely) will be getting Spanx-clad and sequin-spangled on autumnal Saturday nights? Who could get their jazz hands on the glitterball trophy? Who’ll be sent home before their fake tan has dried? We’ve rated this year’s ballroom batch from worst to best in terms of likely sparkly success.15.Ross KingView image in fullscreenRoss King.Photograph: BBC/PAThe celeb bookers totally wanted Ross Kemp, didn’t they?

None have ever lifted the trophy, with 2006 runner-up Matt Dawson coming closest. Could he become the second consecutive Chris to win (after McCausland) and the third Chris overall (see also Hollins)? As a self-confessed “dad dancer”, no. He’ll likely lumber around like a teak wardrobe with a groin strain. Soz.13.Jimmy Floyd HasselbainkView image in fullscreenJimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.Photograph: BBC/PADespite all those kicks, flicks and tricks, male footballers traditionally fare even worse than rugby players. Only Robbie Savage has passed the contest’s midway mark and he’s half-afghan hound. Former Leeds, Chelsea and Netherlands striker Hasselbaink signed up to impress his Strictly-mad daughters. They should enjoy his participation while it lasts. A contender for the sparkly handled wooden spoon. “Don’t Hassle the Baink” won’t even become a catchphrase, sadly.12.Thomas SkinnerView image in fullscreenThomas Skinner.Photograph: BBC/PABosh. In one of the more curious career trajectories of recent times, Essex pillow salesman Skinner shot to cult fame on the 2019 series of The Apprentice. He’s since become a populist influencer who praises Donald Trump and struck up an unlikely friendship with JD Vance, while slating Labour, Just Stop Oil and the “woke brigade™”. Mainly, though, he posts his massive artery-clogging breakfasts on social media, always ending with his catchphrase “Bosh”. He’s Del Boy for the TikTok generation. Farage in Reebok Classics and a puffy gilet. Can he dance? He’ll give it a go for Britain.

Theatrical and elegant, she’s also become an LGBTQ+ heroine as one half of lesbian couple “Sukeve”.

His Spandex-clad colleague, Montell “Fire” Douglas, reached the quarter-final last year and he could do likewise. Expect muscly stripping, pugil stick props and (hopefully) the running man on a travelator.9.La VoixView image in fullscreenLa Voix.Photograph: PHOTOGRAPHER:/BBCVoilà, it’s La Voix. Rattling the earrings of Middle England comes Strictly’s first ever main series drag queen. The franchise tested the water in the Christmas special with Tayce, who duly won. La Voix, AKA Christopher Dennis from County Durham, was runner-up on last year’s Drag Race UK and Britain’s Got Talent semi-finalist. She’s trained in musical theatre, will look fabulous and generally slay but will La Voix get La Votes?8.Kristian NairnView image in fullscreenKristian Nairn.Photograph: BBC/PAHold the stage door, it’s Hodor the hoofer. Casting the Game of Thrones cult hero is a curveball that even Bran Stark didn’t see coming. Nairn admits: “This will be a huge challenge for me physically but I’m ready to rise to it.” The gentle giant has a thriving side hustle as a house DJ, so rhythm and musicality should be strengths. He’s also a total dude with a winning sense of humour, so will win over Westeros novices. Expect a cockle-warming journey of weight loss, self-discovery and dragon-themed routines, while various GoT alumni cheer him on from the front row. Winter is coming to the ballroom. You know nothing, Tony Beak.7.Karen CarneyView image in fullscreenKaren Carney.Photograph: BBC/PAThis is the summer of the Lionesses and in the absence of a current player – Leah Williamson was a rumoured target – midfielder-turned-pundit Carney is the next best thing. Expect goodwill in abundance when the Brummie wing wizard laces up her ballroom boots. There’s speculation that she’ll form half of Strictly’s first all-female partnership since 2022 (and only the third ever), which would be a welcome twist. A routine set to Sweet Caroline or Freed From Desire would blow the Elstree Studios roof off. Bring on the 4am karaoke sessions and victory parades.6.George ClarkeView image in fullscreenGeorge Clarke.Photograph: BBC/PANot to be confused with the Channel 4 property presenter and treehouse-botherer, this one is a YouTuber also known as “George Clarkey”. Honestly, I don’t know how they dream up these crazy nicknames. His comedy skits and Useless Hotline Podcast have seen him amass millions of followers. He’s played down his dance ability – saying he’ll “potentially fall over a fair bit” and “I once ordered pasodoble at a Spanish restaurant” – but the yoof vote could carry him to the final, à la Joe Sugg in 2018. Don’t forget to like and subscribe, guys. Guys?5.Vicky PattisonView image in fullscreenVicky Pattison.Photograph: BBC/PAShe’s been crowned Queen Of The Jungle on I’m a Celeb. Will she now be Queen Of The Jive? Canny lass Pattison found fame on Geordie Shore but has since carved out an impressive career as a documentary-maker, author, campaigner and presenter. Far brighter and funnier than reality stars are often given credit for, she could go even further than her mate Pete Wicks last year. It’ll also be fun watching her pro partner being baffled by her Tyneside accent. “What are these stottie cakes and broon ales?”4.Stefan DennisView image in fullscreenStefan Dennis.Photograph: BBC/PAStrewth, mate, it’s Paul Robinson from Neighbours. The bad-boy businessman and Ramsay Street Lothario is basically Ian Beale without the blubbing. He’s starred in West End musicals and had a pop career (who can forget his 1989 hit Don’t It Make You Feel Good?), so can hoof a bit. Jason Donovan, who played his on-screen brother Scott, reached the final. Could Erinsborough’s elder statesman find the perfect blend? He hails from Tawonga in Victoria, not far from judge Craig Revel Horwood’s home town of Ballarat, so could call in local favours in return for free drinks at Lassiters.3.Alex KingstonView image in fullscreenAlex Kingston.Photograph: BBC/PAWhile her fellow contestants supplied the usual platitudes about “comfort zones” and “being Strictly-fied”, Kingston’s quote on her official BBC announcement simply said: “Aaaaagghhh!!!!!!” We like her already. The ER and Doctor Who star was inspired to sign up by her pal Sarah Hadland, a runner-up last year. At 62, she might be the field’s oldest female but don’t bet against her. Classy casting. In your face, Dancing On Ice.2.Dani DyerView image in fullscreenDani Dyer.Photograph: BBC/PAOwn up, who else’s heart skipped a beat when they heard this name? So close to Danny Dyer doing a samba and yet so far. Sadly, he once said: “I get offered Strictly every year but I’ve got no desire to be mincing around in sequins.” Still, the daughter of the beloved cockney thesp is a decent signing in her own right. She’s fresh from the first dance at her wedding to West Ham captain Jarrod Bowen and sweetly describes Strictly as “the second most amazing thing I’ve done this year”. As a Love Island winner, Dyer Jr has form for triumphing in reality contests. We predict a waltz to Hammers anthem I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles, while her dad gets weepy in the front row.1.Ellie GoldsteinView image in fullscreenEllie Goldstein.Photograph: PRShe was the first model with Down’s syndrome to grace the cover of Vogue and partnered with Mattel to launch the first Barbie doll with Down’s syndrome. Now trailblazer Ellie Goldstein notches up another milestone by becoming the first Strictly contestant with Down’s syndrome. She’s already requested Nikita Kuzmin as her pro partner because “he’s hot and fit”. Don’t beat around the bush, Ellie, say what you mean. The irrepressible 23-year-old recently branched out into acting on CBBC’s Malory Towers. The myth-busting Mencap ambassador has the charisma, confidence and talent to make her bookies’ early favourite. It’s another step forward for inclusivity and could be the feelgood story of the autumn.Explore more on these topicsStrictly Come DancingTelevisionEntertainment TVBBCReality TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They belong to Martin, aka Mr Creep, the alter ego of Theodora van der Beek, all lank hair, faux leather jacket and grubby 70s aesthetic.To call Martin a character would be stretching a point: he does not actually do very much in this entertaining show, half lecture, half film screening. He is more object than protagonist. He is a symbol of every office pest, every man who gets uncomfortably close on public transport, every bloke with a warped sense of his sexual attractiveness to younger women. He eats a lot of ham.I See You Watching review – the male gaze in full effectRead moreThe show is a product of lockdown when the performer and her six-strong household decided to throw an office party at home, seeing as none of them had an office of their own. They took on roles from intern to boss and Van der Beek came as the office creep.

That friend is the kind you might hesitate to buy an expensive ticket for because there’s a chance she might not show up.“But in the spur of the moment, she’ll do something amazing,” says Rutledge, like the time her daughter was setting up a new apartment. Out of the blue, the type B friend showed up with a full set of dishes and a KitchenAid mixer.“We appreciate her ability to be completely spontaneous,” Rutledge says of her friend. “She inspires us to be more free-spirited.”The type B personality is having a moment. On TikTok,videoson being and celebrating type B have thousands of views; plenty also poke fun at it. Theviralityhas given some a label for how they operate; maybe you’re type Bat workornavigatingtype A spaces.View image in fullscreenHelene Rutledge views Type A people as being goal-oriented and punctual.Photograph: Courtesy Helene RutledgeBut it is not a scientifically validated way to understand personality. Over the last 50 years, it has become clear that there are no personality types, explains Colin DeYoung, the lab director of the DeYoung Personality Lab at the University of Minnesota. Instead, personality is more like a spectrum of traits.Categories may be comforting, but they can also be limiting. So why do we keep returning to them? Experts say they can help us understand human behavior and contemporary culture. But digging deeper into how personality works offers its own sort of satisfaction, and an honesty that goes beyond typology.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’What does it mean to betype B?Types A and B are more or less “historical artefacts”, says Christopher Soto, a psychology professor at Colby College. They wereintroducedin the late 1950s by cardiologists linking personality to heart attack risk. Type A behavior was characterized as competitive and work-driven, whiletype Bemerged as the less aggressive, laid-back opposite – essentially the antithesis of type A. (The tobacco industryfundedmuch of this research as part of a strategy to blame something other than cigarettes for poor health.)Is thetype B personality real?Over time, early findings related to types A and B didn’t hold up, says Soto. High anxiety correlated with health issues, but being conscientious and diligent were actually linked to better health.It’s also evident that most people don’t fit neatly into either type. Today, most personality researchers take a trait-based, rather than type-based, perspective, says Emorie Beck, an assistant professor at UC Davis who specializes in personality psychology. The gold standard for describing these trait differences is the Big Five model. The Big Five traits – openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism – are broad dimensions, explains Beck. People vary in their degree of each trait.Still, popular culture holds on to types. Definitions vary slightly, and people tend to highlight the traits they like, says Soto. For example, Rutledge views type A as being goal-oriented and punctual. Alexey Novikov, a clown and editor who feels more type B, views type A as rule–bound and capitalistic.“I don’t want to be type A,” says Novikov. “They seem tightly wound.”Why is thetype B personality going viral?As work culture has grown more intense and productivity-focused, interest in the type B personality has grown, says Soto. It may be a reaction to hustle culture. As people resist constant pressure, a more relaxed mindset is appealing.Rutledge has observed this rising appreciation for type B qualities. Once, society idealized type A drive in the workplace. Now, growing burnout and dissatisfaction at work have nudged people toward an appreciation for type B traits, she suggests.Why it’s good to admit when you’re wrong – and how to improveRead moreFor Novikov, the appeal lies in detaching from traditional notions of success. He used to work with many type A people and realized it wasn’t for him. “Moving away from that has given me a lot more headspace to enjoy my life,” he says.Typologies can reflect cultural niches, says Beck. People connect with labels that match traits they admire. Seeing others with the same label can feel validating, she explains.Kimberly Williams, an HR manager, says the type B conversation helped her realize she’s not an outlier: “It’s made me lessen this yearning to be a perfect type A person.”Why is thetype A/type B idea so persistent?Despite shaky scientific support, the type A/B concept persists.

Results can be thought-provoking and feel accurate. He acknowledges that being sorted into “different boxes” is an easier way to think about complex concepts.Such categories – including type A/type B,Myers-Briggs personality typesandEnneagram numbers– are often broad and positive. It can be easy to identify with where you’re placed – that’s their flaw, but also part of the charm, explains Soto.While not harmful in themselves, personality typologies can be misused, says Soto. Companies sometimes overvalue certain types and use flawed tests to match hires. There’s also the issue of self-criticism if you don’t fit the ideal.“For a long time, I would get down on myself because I wasn’t type A,” says Williams. Now she and her friends can laugh about it – and hold each other accountable. “It’s like, ‘OK guys, we know we’re all B so we need to put some controls in place and get here on time,’” she says.Is there any benefit to thetype A/type B dichotomy?At the very least, it’s simple. Beck says thinking in terms of traits can feel messy, especially when you also consider complexities like the idea that it may change depending on the situation.JoAnna Wendel, a science writer, says that she can appreciate her type A or type B qualities depending on the context. She values work boundaries and doesn’t feel the need for things to be a certain way. But she does feel type A when it comes to timeliness and scheduling in her personal life.“I’ve been the type A person on a trip with type B people,” says Wendel. “We’ve got to get to the airport on time – I’m not running down the terminal.”View image in fullscreenSusannah Bard says that not acting Type A felt like a hindrance when growing up.Photograph: Courtesy Susannah BardBut traits are not fixed. They can shift over time, shaped by life or intention. “There’s this lingering idea that people’s personalities can’t change, but that’s not true,” says DeYoung. If you want to change, Beck recommends practice, like allowing yourself to be bad at something if you’re overly concerned with success.Thinking in terms of traits, rather than types, also helps explain why people react differently to the same scenario, says DeYoung. This can help us see the strengths associated with our traits and find a path that fits who we are, he explains.Susannah Bard, a managing director of a creative agency, says that not acting type A felt like a hindrance when growing up. “I thought not being super good at school would mean I wouldn’t be successful in the workforce,” she says.Instead, she’s found the opposite to be true. In a career where thinking freely and creatively are prioritized, the qualities associated with type B are advantages.“We’re all individuals with different strengths and tendencies, and the range of all that probably takes up the whole alphabet,” says Bard.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our intrepid tester tries unexpected options, from pickled onion to tzatzikiTim DowlingFri 15 Aug 2025 09.16 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 13.35 EDTShareGenerally speaking, the moreTikToktrends you allow to pass you by in a year, the better. But some trends refuse to cease, and the egg flight is turning out to be one of them. The egg flight, in all its many forms, persists.Simply put, an egg flight is to hard-boiled eggs what a wine flight is to wine – a varietal sampling, presented in one sitting. Unlike devilled eggs, where the yolk is scooped out, mashed with mayonnaise and spices and piped back into its former cavity, the egg flight is just some eggs – most commonly three, in six upturned halves – with different stuff piled on top. The result is meant to be a quick but still fancy appetiser range, destined to impress your guests, your family, or at least the rest of TikTok.The originator and chief populariser of the egg flight (or #eggflight) is an American cookery blogger and TikToker called Alice Choi (AKA@hipfoodiemom1). She has been doing them for years, but her egg demonstrations first went viral this time last year, and egg-flight TikTok posts now number in the thousands. All over the world, people are still getting excited about their egg flights.Would-be egg-flight makers are encouraged to get creative and try new things, but in practice the discipline seems to involve a lot of imitation, in keeping with the average TikToker’s overarching definition of originality: the exact same thing, but with me doing it.In that same spirit, here are 10 popular variations, dutifully copied and ranked.A quick note: my eggs were boiled for just under 11 minutes, plunged into ice water, then carefully peeled and halved. Before you begin, I recommend putting a small blob of mayonnaise on the plate beneath each egg half to stop it rocking back and forth while you dress it.View image in fullscreenThe Classic.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The Guardian1. The Classic.Inone of her viral tutorials, @hipfoodiemom1 offers the closest thing we may ever have to an Egg Flight Theory: the ideal egg requires something creamy, topped by something tangy, topped by something sour and/or crunchy. The Classic is the most basic combo to follow that formula and it’s easily the best: mayo, dijon mustard and a slice of dill pickle. That’s it – stop there. It’s essentially a lazy person’s devilled egg, and, honestly, it cannot be improved upon.View image in fullscreenKimchi.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The Guardian2. Kimchi.Another of Choi’s creamy/tangy/sour stacks, with a mayo-mustard base and fermented cabbage at its apex. Overall this may be your best bet, since it’s easier to buy good kimchi in the UK than it is to find a decent dill pickle.View image in fullscreenSmoked salmon.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The Guardian3. Smokedsalmon.A popular school of thought in egg-flight circles involves treating the egg as if it were some other foodstuff – in this case, a bagel layered with cream cheese, smoked salmon, capers, dill and possibly some poppy or sesame seeds. This sort of variation often flounders on its implicit unfulfilled promise – a hard-boiled egg is not a bagel, after all – but it works here because all the ingredients share a general breakfast vibe.View image in fullscreenCaprese.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The Guardian4. Caprese.Mozzarella, tomato, a single, appropriately sized basil leaf and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. By now you will have noticed a key drawback to the egg flight: you need a huge variety of ingredients – in very small amounts – to produce six completely different eggs. There is ultimately more shopping than cooking involved. The caprese salad egg is a nice idea, but at this point the notion of not bothering is also beginning to take hold.5. Mexican.Across TikTok, you will find egg halves piled with a selection of some, if not all, of the following: guacamole, taco meat, tortilla slivers or crumbs, onion, tomato, sour cream, hot sauce, coriander, jalapeño. Of course that’s way too many things – I strongly advise you to stick with a maximum of four. Anyway, these ingredients are not the problem. The problem is the hard-boiled egg at the bottom: it doesn’t belong.View image in fullscreenPickled onion.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The Guardian6. Pickledonion.Again, the rule of smooth-tangy-sour applies here – you need all three to offset the rubbery blandness of the egg. Choi pickles her own onions with rosemary and cinnamon and always has a jar on hand, but you can easily manage a quick pickle – thinly sliced onion steeped in salt and rice vinegar for half an hour. Or, in an emergency, you can just use mayo, mustard and raw onion, although I can’t really imagine the set of circumstances that would lead to an egg-flight emergency.View image in fullscreenTzatziki.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The Guardian7.Tzatziki.My only original contribution to the egg-flight canon, because I found that I had some tzatziki on hand – Greek yoghurt mixed with grated cucumber, minced garlic and chopped mint, with a sprinkling of paprika on top. I don’t mean to blow my own horn, but this works better than perhaps it should. I have since seen other people on TikTok spooning tzatziki on eggs, and then pushing chickpeas into it. I cannot condone this.View image in fullscreenThe BLT.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The Guardian8. BLT.You get the idea: bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo. An enduring combination let down by the fact that the whole mouthful is still going to be 80% egg by weight – a flavour imbalance that simply cannot be corrected. It is possibly a little late in the game for me to confess that I don’t really care for hard-boiled eggs, and I’ve already consumed more of them in an afternoon than I normally would in a year.View image in fullscreenCaesar salad.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The Guardian9. Caesar salad.Even if you love hard-boiled eggs – and I’ve made my position clear – you must eventually accept that the egg flight is a steeply descending staircase: the law of diminishing returns comes into effect once you’ve passed half a dozen variations. When you start making a caesar salad on top of an egg – lettuce, miniature croutons, dressing, parmesan shavings – you’ve taken things too far. It looks better in a photograph than it’s ever going to taste.View image in fullscreenBurger.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The Guardian10. Burgeregg.Given my ambivalence toward the hard-boiled egg – which has long since curdled into full-blown hostility – the last variation I tried to make was always going to rank the lowest. This really was a disappointment, however: idiotically sized mini-burger, cheese square, tomato, ketchup. It’s not a burger and it is not a fitting topping for an egg. Null points, and never again.Explore more on these topicsEggsFoodSocial mediaTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There will always be at least some process of adaptation, particularly given the slight change of shape the arrival of Florian Wirtz has entailed.The danger forLiverpoolis that they give up points that could prove costly if this is a tight title race. While that transition goes on, results perhaps matter more than performances, so long as the trend of those performances is towards a greater cohesion.Chiesa and Salah’s late show earns Liverpool dramatic win against BournemouthRead moreImprovement certainly is needed. Liverpool cannot give up goals as easily as they did in the Community Shield and here if they are to defend their title. But they found a way to get the three points, the key goal coming from the most unlikely source of Federico Chiesa, and started the season with a win.And for all the talk of personnel changes and tactics, the image ofMohamed Salahstanding alone before the Kop after the final whistle, wiping the tears away with his cuff as fans sang the Diogo Jota song, was a poignant image of how difficult this season will inevitably be for Liverpool’s players.It’s not invalid to talk of the mundanities of football – indeed it’s a necessary part of the process – but equally this served as a reminder that grief is woven inevitably through this season. The football soap opera will perhaps struggle to find a vocabulary to discuss something so personal, so unpredictable, so potentially debilitating, but that does not mean that it is not there.The tributes before kick-off were moving and the minute’s silence for Jota and his brother reverently observed, but there was still a match to be played, for football, life, always goes on.Some of Liverpool’s new signings, it’s fair to say, have settled in rather better than others. Hugo Ekitiké embellished the good impression he had made in the Community Shield, but Milos Kerkez is finding settling in rather harder. The 21-year-old Hungarian had an awkward afternoon last Sunday, dragged about by Ismaïla Sarr, and he no more enjoyed facing his former team-mate Antoine Semenyo.View image in fullscreenFederico Chiesa fires home the decisive third goal as Liverpool managed to start the season with a win, despite Bournemouth’s comeback to 2-2.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAThere was a strange jitteriness to Kerkez throughout, as though he had begun to doubt himself and, in trying to rectify that with decisive contributions, had lost a degree of judgment. He was fortunate an early lunge on the Ghanaian made minimal contact but didn’t get away with an even wilder flying challenge on Adam Smith and was rightly booked.Not, it should be said, that Andy Robertson fared much better, having replaced Kerkez on the hour. Semenyo had darted in front of Kerkez to meet a low cross from Adrien Truffert early on and it was a very similar move that led to Bournemouth’s first goal four minutes later, David Brooks this time delivering the cross. The sense perhaps is that whatever unease Kerkez may be feeling after his step up, there is also a broader tactical issue.The Community Shield and this game maintained the pattern Liverpool had demonstrated during pre-season of looking very exciting going forward but far less impressive at the back. The adoption of a more man-to-man pressing system seems to have rendered them vulnerable to direct running into the tracts that are mystifyingly appearing behind or in front of the back four.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The shame is that what should have been an excellent night for Semenyo also involved him reporting an incident of racial abuse to the referee Anthony Taylor.Ekitiké made a rather more positive impression, although, as in the Community Shield, there was bewilderment that having taken one chance supremely well, he then fluffed a seemingly easier opportunity soon after. The goal he scored, though, was remarkable as he received the ball with six Bournemouth players around him, bundled through Marcos Senesi and then finished with a calm certainty.But more than the individuals the question mark is over the tweak to the system. Perhaps everything will look better when Ryan Gravenberch returns from suspension and can take up his place at the back of midfield. Certainly it’s hard to imagine him, whatever the diktats of the pressing system, leaving the centre of defence as exposed as it was for the Bournemouth equaliser. Dominik Szoboszlai has not convinced in the deeper role and it may be that his immediate future is as back-up to Wirtz.One of the issues thrown up by the Community Shield was the isolation of Salah but that, at least, looks as though it may be readily resolved. His link-up with Jeremie Frimpong is a work in progress, but there were early signs of an understanding with Ekitiké and he played a decisive role in Liverpool’s late surge for victory, his cross leading, via a series of shots, blocks and half-clearances, to Chiesa’s volleyed goal before he got the fourth with a typically decisive finish.This is a long way from the controlled Liverpool of last season but it remains, for now, a winning Liverpool.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolDiogo JotaMohamed SalahBournemouthFootball tacticsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Every decision relating to her career has been dissected and debated. The most banal details surrounding her personal life have been transfigured into headline news. In order to find herself on and off the tennis court, Raducanu has had to learn how to tune out the noise, which at times can be deafening.Only one month ago at Wimbledon, the discourse surrounding the 22-year-old reached diabolical lows. Even though her on-court performances were strong, it was impossible to escape the speculation surrounding her personal life. In the bowels of Center Court at the Cincinnati Open, I offer my own blunt perspective: I have never cringed as much as I did while watching people trying to pry into her romantic relationships at the All England Club. “Yeah, and Cam’s questions, too,” Raducanu responds, laughing. “That was terrible.Terrible.”She was referring to her compatriot Cameron Norrie’s post-match press conference, when a reporter asked him whether he was dating Raducanu. Norrie, who was being supported in his player box that day by his long-term partner, was as baffled as he was bemused. For Raducanu, though, such brazen intrusiveness from strangers has simply become part of her everyday life. “I know, I know,” she says, smiling. “I guess it comes with the territory, people being so curious. I think they’re more curious about this news than any tennis results and tennis news. But I just keep to myself, my private life to one side. It’s always funny when people try to find something out, but I try not to read into it so much.”That curiosity is not isolated to the internet and tabloids. When Raducanu is out in London, paparazzi will find her, even when she is doing nothing more than stepping on to a 345 bus somewhere in Wandsworth. “It’s really freaky, because you don’t know they’re there. And then you’ll see a photo of yourself the next day, and you’ll be like: ‘There’s no way they were there,’” she says.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu with the US Open trophy in 2021.Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPAConsidering her well-documented encounters with stalkers – one was arrested andhanded a five-year restraining orderafter stealing items from her front door in 2021 and another fixated person followed her across four different countries earlier this year – Raducanu has genuine concerns regarding her safety: “After theDubai incident, that was probably the worst [public attention] I’ve had,” she says. “I remember straight afterwards, I found it very difficult going out. I definitely had a bit of a leftover lag effect. But I’ve been a lot more astute, a lot more, I’d say, safe and I have someone with me. I don’t really go out on my own as much. No solo walks. Just always having someone watching my back.”Everything leads back to those three fateful weeks at the US Open in the summer of 2021, where Raducanu became the first qualifier to win a grand slam title in the open era. The spoils of victory were significant but Raducanu’s rapid success yielded considerable challenges. Along with the difficult results and constant criticism, her body constantly betrayed her. In 2023, after struggling physically for a long time, she underwent surgeries on both wrists and her left ankle.While she tried to prove herself on the court, Raducanu says, people within her team would tell her she was not tough. “I was obviously, like: ‘Oh, no, Iamtough enough,’” she says. “It wasn’t good to hear, because I always prided myself on being a hard worker and being tough. And I believe I am. I actually think it was more the people around me that were incorrect, and it led me to having three surgeries and double wrist surgery. I was overtraining and just covering it up, not saying I was in pain, even when I was. So it was really tough to hear. But as I’ve grown with experience, I kind of realised my body a bit more and trusted myself a bit more.”Mentally, things were even more challenging. As she failed to follow up her breakthrough victory with similar results, there were times when her mind twisted her US Open triumph into a negative memory, the source of her struggles. It was not until this year that she understood how to focus on her improvement and daily work, however gradual, rather than comparing every result with the 2021 US Open. Still, it remains a work in progress. “It’s [comparisons to the US Open] something that never fully leaves you,” Raducanu says. “I think it’s been four years now, I don’t think it’s fully gone away. Maybe in a few years, maybe when I’m older, more mature, but it’s hard to put that aside completely. It’s always in the back of your mind, but it’s more just being aware of those thoughts and then not letting it crash your day or ruin the work that you’re doing, and bringing it back to what I’m doing now, and the process.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve tried,” she says. “I’ve obviously been recommended to do it a lot, with what I went through. It was something that not many people, well actually, no one has gone through, which is probably the reason I did two sessions and I stopped. I was like: ‘Look, these guys, they don’t relate.’ And, to be honest, no other athlete has done what I’ve done, so I don’t know why I’m taking advice from them. So I was like: ‘OK, well, the only person who can help me is myself.’”For a long time the four defining cities of Raducanu’s life were listed in her biographies across her social media platforms. Her parents, Ion and Renee, originally come from Bucharest, Romania, and Shenyang, China, respectively while she was born in Toronto, Canada, and grew up in London, England. Her mother’s solo immigration from China to Canada has been an inspirational tale throughout her life. “I would say it’s funny when people ask where you’re from,” she says. “Obviously, I feel British. I’ve grown up there, But there are certain things, the way I think, I don’t think I am completely. So you have a little question about your identity. But I try not to read too much into it and try to just take the best from all the different worlds that I’ve been exposed to and grown up in.”Regardless of the subject at hand, Raducanu frequently notes the support and significance of her parents. She describes her upbringing as rigid and strict, but their tough love has made her the person she is today. “I was always brought up with really high standards, high expectations of myself, not much sympathy,” says Raducanu. “So when I was younger, that was tough, and even now. But I think it really shaped me to be the player I am, the person I am; pretty down to earth. They never got impressed by anything glitzy or high or anything.”View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu during her narrow defeat by Aryna Sabalenka in the Cincinnati Open.Photograph: Dylan Buell/Getty ImagesBoth Raducanu’s parents worked in finance and they passed on their numerical, logical mindsets. Over the past few years, however, part of her evolution as an adult has been understanding herself as a person. Her injury layoff in 2023, which initially seemed like a catastrophe, turned out to be essential for her personal development. Raducanu spent her time away from tennis travelling, including a long trip to China, trying different hobbies and gradually learning more about herself. She learned that she is also creative, which has significantly influenced her playing style on the court. “I kind of discovered the more artistic side – the piano, the painting, the reading, the philosophy, all of those things,” she says. “I really think it opened my eyes to another world. Now I’m kind of seeing how I can find an area where those two intersect, and have the creative side but also have the quantitative side.”With age and experience, Raducanu also has a greater understanding of her preferences when making general decisions. While discussing her decision making, Raducanu’s mind shifts to another source of criticism: her coaching history. “I’m a lot more clear on what I do and don’t like,” she says. “The experiences that I’ve had with different coaches … People love to say I’ve had so many different coaches but if I went into the details of a lot of them, people would not be saying the same thing. I just don’t do that, because I don’t want to “out” these people. So I keep it to myself.”Is it ever tempting? “When you see things like: ‘Oh, Emma on herninthcoach’, I’m like: ‘Guys, come on.’ Certain ones don’t count. If you’ve had a trial, you don’t have to carry on after the trial. A few have been trials, a few have been other situations. I just try and take the high road,” she says. Then she laughs. “And try to do what the royal family would do.”After years of rolling with the punches and gradually coming to understand herself, Raducanu seems to finally be in a positive place again. She speaks effusively about the great enjoyment she has found in her consistent daily work and she has thrown herself into becoming the best player she can be each day. Raducanu’s results are reflective of that shift and her ranking is on the rise. Her time in Cincinnati, her first week with her new coach, Francisco Roig, ended with acolossal three-hour battlewith Aryna Sabalenka, the world No 1, where she narrowly lost 7-6 (5) in the final set. Over the next few days, she will return to New York for the US Open more self-assured than she has been since she won the title.Our second conversation ends with a final question on Raducanu’s ambitions for the next few years beyond her results. After a beat, she shrugs. The hope, she says, is that the passion and joy she now feels each day about her daily work will endure. “I want to continue for the next few years to just keep enjoying because I would rather not do anything else or be anywhere else,” she says. “I see my friends, like, somewhere in the south of France, and they’re chilling on a boat or whatever, and I’m just like: ‘OK, well, it looks amazing,’ but when I’m putting in double session practices with the people around laughing, that fills me up so much more. So I’m really happy to have gotten to this place and [I want] to just continue that.”Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The 27-year-old has been accused of caring more about playing for Argentina and was linked with a move to Atlético Madrid this summer but Frank is confident the centre-back’s long-term future lies in north London.Premier League: 10 things to look out for on the opening weekendRead more“I’ve worked with him closely for more than five weeks; I’ve seen a very, very committed player who’s trained very well,” the Spurs manager said. “The staff have said to me they’ve never seen him train that well. He’s in a very good place. I see a player that will want to lead the team and push the team.”Frank was asked whether giving Romero the armband was potentially the first step towards the player extending his contract, which expires in two years. “Yes,” he said. “But I think when you name a captain it’s because you think he’s the best that can help the team no matter what now and also in the future. It’s not really linked with the contract situation. Of course he’s a very good player so I want him to stay longer.”Romero has lacked consistency at times but Frank is convinced of his quality. “I see a very big and very good player. What I like about him and why I have chosen him as captain is his leadership qualities on the pitch. There is a big respect for him from the players. Off the pitch as well he also sets the standards.“When I was 27 of course I thought I could do everything but I also found out that as a leader I am 1,000% better now, so he also needs to learn and become better and better, so I will do my best to guide him. His aggression is phenomenal. He is fantastic in the duels. When he gives that to the team, he can transform the team and give energy to the team so I think that’s extremely important.”Spurs impressedagainst Paris Saint-Germain in the Super Cup finalon Wednesday, taking a 2-0 lead before losing on penalties. They have a quick turnaround before hosting Burnley on Saturday in Frank’s first league game but the Dane believes that the Dutch centre-back Micky van de Ven, who had fitness problems last season, can handle two games a week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have spent almost £200m on players this ­summer.­Viktor Gyökeres is expectedto lead the line against United and the midfielder Martín Zubimendi is also likely to make his debut.Premier League 2025-26 preview No 1: ArsenalRead moreArteta’s side face a tricky run, with a trip to the champions, Liverpool, in their third match, before they face Manchester City at home on 21 September. But theArsenalmanager insisted they could draw on their ­previous experience to get over the line.“You keep digging, digging, ­digging and you have to be digging because one day the gold is going to be there,” he said. “That’s all the time. When I’ve been taught, when I’ve been educated, that’s it. For three seasons we’ve had more points than any other team in this league, which is incredible. That’s how you have all the consistency. Now we have to do it in a season to have one more point or the same amount of points and more goals different than any other team. That’s the objective.”City have actually accumulated four more points than Arsenal’s 247 over the past three seasons. Those clubs have spent similar gross amounts this summer but Liverpool have outstripped them and could add to their squad. Arteta confirmed Arsenal were also looking to bring in more players amid interest in Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze but believes they are capable of competing regardless.View image in fullscreenTony Adams called for Martin Ødegaard to be replaced as captain by Declan Rice.Photograph: John Walton/PA“I think we have great versatility, very different qualities in relation to the opposition as well,” he said. “We can manipulate that and have some great cohesion within those units so we are very happy with that.”The form of Martin Ødegaard will be crucial after he endured a testing season that yielded only three goals and eight assists in the league. Arteta said that despite suggestions from Tony Adams – who led Arsenal to the Double in 2002 – that Declan Rice should take over the captaincy, the Norwegian was the almost unanimous choice in a vote conducted this week by his staff and the rest of the players.“My opinion is clear and it’s not just my opinion, it’s all the staff and especially the players,” he said.Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetanewsShareReuse this content"

A source at the company described this week’s announcement as the culmination of a two-year journey into rugby.Unusually, the Newcastle purchase was driven by its London office rather than from company headquarters in Fuschl, Austria, which was behind moves into Formula One and extreme sports, as well as a growing football stable that now includes almost 10% of Leeds as well as the flagship clubs Red Bull Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg. Significantly, Red Bull Sport’s managing director, Oliver Mintzlaff, who oversaw theremoval of the F1 team principal Christian Hornerlast month, announced the takeover, which shows it has the backing of the people who matter.Red Bull has invested in rugby before and has endorsement deals with the England winger Jack Nowell and South Africa’s double World Cup-winning captain Siya Kolisi, having previously being a sponsor for England Rugby, but Newcastle are the first club it has bought. The process began when the London-based marketing executive team contacted the RFU andPremiershipRugby Limited two years ago to discuss potential investments.Firefighter, mother, tattooist: three rugby part-timers on their sacrifices to live a World Cup dreamRead more“We like rugby because it is where extreme sports meets the mainstream,” the Red Bull source said. “It’s exciting, fast-paced and contains that element of risk that appeals to our customers. We think rugby has been undervalued historically, and want to help grow the sport generally, and of course, in Newcastle, in particular.”Red Bull approached the talks with an open mind, but it soon became clear that rather than another sponsorship deal they wanted to buy a meaningful stake in a club or league. An invitation to invest in the proposed new breakaway league, R360, was dismissed with Red Bull preferring to partner with an established competition.With Worcester, London Irish and Wasps having gone out of business in the past three years, and seven of the 10 remaining Premiership clubseffectively trading insolvent, with net debts of more than £300m, there were no shortage of takers. While Red Bull spoke to other clubs, Newcastle soon emerged as the preferred option due a combination of their desperate need for funding and the potential upside – a big city club with a young population in a sports-mad region and no other professional rugby union club for 100 miles.“It’s a stroke of genius from Red Bull,” says Phillips, who now runs his own executive coaching company, Optimist Performance. “They’ve bought access to a huge market pretty cheaply. They can promote their products to all the students in Newcastle, Durham and York.“By buying a team at the bottom of the league they’re almost guaranteed to succeed, at least in relative terms. If there’s sporting success in the north-east, people follow pretty quickly.”View image in fullscreenThere has been little to celebrate in recent times at Newcastle, having won two games in the past two Premiership seasons.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesRed Bull’s other sporting investments have followed a similar model of buying distressed assets and embarking on transformation projects and Newcastle certainly fit that template.Steve Diamond’s side have won two Premiership games in the past two years so the only way is up, but Red Bull provided funding before the takeover was completed to facilitate the signings of the New Zealander back-rower Tom Christie from Crusaders and the Argentina scrum-half Simón Benítez-Cruz.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There will be considerable investment in the Kingston Park stadium, a new indoor facility is planned at their training ground and the matchday experience for fans is likely to be transformed, with exhibitions from extreme sports and live stunts on the cards. A new club badge will accompany the rebranded Red Bull name, while a kit launch is being planned for the middle of the season.For Premiership Rugby, the takeover is particularly timely as the domestic top-flight isalso being rebrandedthis season. From next month it will be known as the Gallagher Prem, part of a campaign to engage younger audiences by talking up the league’s intensity, physicality and occasional brutality.After the disastrous post-Covid years of decline and bankruptcy, club rugby has bounced back in the past couple of seasons, with TV viewing figures up 30% year-on-year in 2024-25, which persuaded TNT Sports to pay £200m for a new four-year rights deal.“It’s a unique investment,” says Simon Massie-Taylor, the chief executive of Prem Rugby. “Ultimately, Red Bull are in the business of selling drinks and part of their strategy is to tell really compelling stories about high performance, which they have a lot of experience in.“Red Bull are brilliant marketers and the Newcastle journey will be great for them. They’ve bought an under-performing team with the potential to significantly grow its fanbase – it will be fascinating to see it play out.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastlePremiershipRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His suspension was lifted upon appeal, allowing him to train with and support her onsite throughout the past two weeks in Cincinnati. “It’s great that he’s here in the box, finally, so it’s a good thing,” she said.Since Vukov’s suspension,Rybakina had repeatedly expressed her frustrationabout the ban and she was critical of the WTA. After he was provisionally suspended in January pending the outcome of its investigation, Rybakina said: “I don’t agree with a lot of things what the WTA do in the sense of my relationship with Stefano. As I said before, I have never made any complaints or any of these things. I always said that he never mistreated me.”Although he was banned from receiving credentials to tournaments, Vukov continued to train with Rybakina away from events. She has been working with the Italian former player Davide Sanguinetti since February. This week, Vukov and Sanguinetti have been providing her with advice in training and matches.During her post-match press conference, Rybakina opted not to speak in depth about her work with Vukov. Asked about how helpful it has been to have him onsite again, she responded curtly: “It’s always a help when the whole team is here with me.”View image in fullscreenElena Rybakina talks to coach Stefano Vukov in the stands while playing against Aryna Sabalenka at the Cincinnati Open.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesAnother significant match awaits Rybakina as she rekindles her rivalry with the third seed Iga Swiatek, who remains in excellent form since her Wimbledon victory and defeated the 28th seed Anna Kalinskaya 6-3, 6-4 to advance into the semi-finals.Later on Friday, the men’s second seed Carlos Alcaraz held firm against a quality performance from Andrey Rublev, the 11th seed, as he narrowly reached the semi-final with a 6-3, 4-6, 7-5 win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here, Alcaraz initially appeared to weather the storm as he broke serve for a 5-3 third-set lead but he missed a slew of first serves as he attempted to serve out the match and quickly found himself back at 5-5. Despite missing his first opportunity, Alcaraz maintained his composure and closed out the victory.Alcaraz will face either Ben Shelton or Alexander Zverev in the semi-finals. He and Jannik Sinner are again one round away from facing each other in what would be their fourth consecutive final against each other.Explore more on these topicsTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

But she struck an optimistic note on the eve of the Diamond League meeting in Silesia, Poland, as she readied herself to race again.Keely Hodgkinson storms to 800m gold for GB’s first athletics triumph in ParisRead more“It’s been a long time – over a year since Paris,” she said. “It wasn’t my plan to start this late. But I am just super happy to get back on the start line. I’ve missed it a lot. This is what I train to do. So I can’t wait to get out there and give it my absolute best and let’s see what happens.”Hodgkinson has been battling hamstring issues, which flared shortly after the Olympics and then returned on the eve ofthe Keely Klassic in February, where she had been intending to break the world indoor 800m record. She had hoped to return for last month’s London Diamond League, but had to wait until she was 100% ready again.“It’s been upsetting at times,” she said. “Missing London was hardest for me because I just wanted to be there in front of my home crowd. Yes, it has been frustrating but it makes the good times sweeter and it makes it even better to be here now.”The plan is test her fitness in Poland against a decent field that includes Oratile Nowe of Botswana, who posted the season’s best time of 1:57.49, as well as Gabriela Gajanova, the Slovakian who finished runner-up to Hodgkinson in the 2024 European Championships. If all goes well, she will run again four days later at the Diamond League in Lausanne.“I’ve come out ready to go, so I am just excited to put something together. It’s been a frustrating year. Back in June I was not able to do anything and coming off the back of winning the Olympics last year it was not ideal at all that I just couldn’t get on the start line.“Tomorrow is just a stepping stone on the way to Tokyo,” she added. “And I’m looking forward to getting out there and just being competitive again.”Explore more on these topicsKeely HodgkinsonAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Warriors were way below their best here, but the Robins were ­magnificent from start to finish.Dean Hadley’s first-half try ­coupled with three goals from the boot of Rhyse Martin proved to be enough to secure victory thanks to a stunning defensive rearguard that was only breached four minutes from time when Adam Keighran touched down. That set up a grandstand finale, but the Robins held firm in the final few minutes.It felt like a major psychological blow ahead of the playoffs. “The job’s not done,” Peters said. “We’ve got a tough and challenging run-in but the boys worked extremely hard for each other here. They’ll enjoy the win and they’ll enjoy the journey home.”Hadley’s try midway through the first half was the least Rovers deserved for their dominance with and without the ball. Martin converted that try and then added a penalty on the stroke of half-time to open up a two-score lead that, in truth, Wigan never looked like ­overturning all evening.View image in fullscreenAbbas Miski is tackled by Jai Whitbread and Jez Litten as Hull KR produced a defensive masterclass against Wigan.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA“I thought the best team won,” Wigan’s coach, Matt Peet, said. “If we’d managed to nick anything at the end it would have been against the run of play.”His team will have to improve come the playoffs if they are to defend their title but there is no doubt they have the ability to do so.They fell 10-0 behind in the ­second half when Martin added another ­penalty as Wigan continued to ­struggle. For large stretches, it looked as though the Warriors would be kept scoreless at home but they at least avoided that when Keighran finished a smart move with four minutes to go after a Robins handling error.However,Hull KRrode out some late pressure to all but guarantee their spot at the top of the table come the playoffs.WiganField; Miski, Eckersley, Wardle, Marshall; Keighran, Smith; Havard, O’Neill, Byrne, Walters, Farrell, Ellis.InterchangeMago, Leeming, Dupree, Hill.TryKeighran.GoalKeighran.Sin binFarrell.Hull KRBroadbent; Davies, Hiku, Batchelor, Burgess; Mourgue, Lewis; Sue, Litten, Whitbread, Hadley, Martin, Minchella.InterchangeWaerea-Hargreaves, Luckley, Tanginoa, Leyland.TryHadley.GoalsMartin (3).RefereeLiam Moore.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueWigan WarriorsHull KRRugby leaguematch reportsShareReuse this content"

But while we Israelis hide in our air-conditioned houses, offices and cars, the besieged residents of Gaza can only add the unbearable hot and humid atmosphere to theirstruggleto eat, drink and sleep, in constant fear of death. The starvation crisis that has exploded in Gaza this summer, following Israeli-imposed restrictions on the flow of humanitarian aid, continues to worsen despite mounting international pressure to allow in more food, medicine and critical supplies. And the killing has never stopped, while Israel is preparing for the next stage of the war to “annihilate Hamas”.Most Israelis are self-immunised to the horrors being endured by Palestinians in Gaza. Told by our government and mainstream media that there is no starvation, only Hamas propaganda and fake news spread by antisemites in the western media, they see no moral dilemma. And so, after almost two years of fighting, life in Tel Aviv recalls the antebellum days of endless partying. The beaches and restaurants are packed and Ben Gurion airport is busy again with summer vacationers flying to Greece. Israel’seconomic data is outperformingexpectations. Antiwar sentiment is limited to fear for the plight of Israeli hostages in Hamas tunnels, decreasing motivation to re-enlist inreservist units, and growingPTSD and suicidecases in the military. Nevertheless, most Israelis,even diehard critics of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, would give him carte blanche to continue with the ongoing punishment of Gaza.This public complacency allows Netanyahu to focus his attention on his favourite territory of political power-plays and media manipulation. His current aim issubordinating the military, and the ongoing war gives him an unprecedented opportunity.Zoom out: throughout his long, embattled political career, the chief rivals of Israel’s prime minister have been former military leaders. Having led the country’s most revered institution, they have been the epitome of its old liberal establishment, which Netanyahu vowed to crush and replace withnew elitescomposed of his socially conservative and religious supporters.Beginning with Yitzhak Rabin in the 1990s, Netanyahu has fought them all – military heroes such as Ariel Sharon and Ehud Barak and uniformed apparatchiks including Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot – and survived at the helm. But in a country fighting a permanent war, political control of the military is the key to leadership, and Netanyahu had been restrained by the de facto veto power of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and intelligence community over war-and-peace decision-making.Then came the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023, which the military and intelligence services had failed to anticipate and to contain in time. To most Israelis, it was the worst disaster in the country’s history. But not to Netanyahu, who sensed an unprecedented opportunity to consolidate his power and push aside his long-term rivals. He put the blame squarely on the shoulders of the military and intelligence top brass andprevented an independent inquiry. As the war has dragged on, security chiefs have been purged one after another, to be replaced by the prime minister’s loyalists. The purges have enabled him to spin the story and credit himself for the more successful moves against Hezbollah and Iran, and even for the downfall of the Assad regime in Syria.But self-praise was not enough to make the IDF an offshoot of the “Bibist” personality cult. Netanyahu could only envy his political partner and far-right leader Itamar Ben-Gvir, who had turned Israel’s police and prison service into his private militia bymanipulatingthe senior appointments process. In March, Netanyahu made his move to take over the Kirya, Israel’s answer to the Pentagon, in central Tel Aviv, nominating Lt Gen Eyal Zamir as the new IDF chief of staff. A broad-shouldered tank commander who had served as the prime minister’s military aide a decade earlier, Zamir had close-up knowledge of his former boss and his inner circle. The rightwing politicians and twitterati praised him as an “offensive” commander who would defeat Hamas, unlike his unlucky predecessor, Herzi Halevi, who carried the burden of the 7 October failure. And he was widely expected to preserve the draft exemption for ultra-Orthodox men, relieving Netanyahu of apolitical hot potato.At first, Zamir was quick to adapt. On 18 March, Israel breached ashort-lived ceasefirewith Hamas, intensifying its attacks and temporarily halting the flow of food and humanitarian aid into Gaza. In May, themilitary launched another operationto “eliminate Hamas” and appeared in sync with the stated goal of Netanyahu and the right wing: ethnic cleansing of Gaza by relocating its 2 million Palestinians into guarded enclaves, from which the only way out would be abroad.But it didn’t take long for the supposed Netanyahu crony to expose a different set of priorities. While showing no mercy for the Palestinians, Zamir behaved like the older, risk-averse version of his boss, putting the safety of his troops – and of the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza – above all. And he stuck to his predecessor’s support of Haredi conscription, issuing thousands of draft notes to ultra-Orthodox youth. By early August, as Hamas would not surrender, Netanyahu and his far-right coalition pledged to occupy the remaining Palestinian enclaves even at the risk of harming the hostages. This was Zamir’s moment of rebellion. He reportedlythreatened to resignif forced into a risky operation that would entail long-term occupation.Netanyahu was quick to seize the power-play opportunity, leading as usual from behind. Yair, the prime minister’s son and alpha dog whistler, accused Zamir of abanana-republic military coup.Matters came to a head in a heated security cabinet meeting on 6 August, at which the chief of staff warned against sending his troops into what was “tantamount … to a trap” and risking the hostages’ lives. The compromise was a decision to occupy only Gaza City, force its million inhabitants out and raze it – just as the IDF had already done in Rafah and Khan Yunis. A two-month deadline was given before implementation, leaving time for a last-minute hostages-for-ceasefire deal.The power struggle, however, did not stop after the cabinet decision, as defence minister Israel Katz kept up his pressure on Zamir to bow or leave. The once unthinkable idea of sacking the military chief after less than six months in office, an almost Stalinist pace of purging, has now been normalised in the public sphere. The supposed potential successor candidates are “more offensive” generals committed to obeying the prime minister and working towards Gaza’s total destruction.All this unfolds amid Gaza’s starvation crisis and hostages suffering in Hamas tunnels. On Sunday, a mass protest and strike has been organised, calling for an end to the war and the return of the hostages. It enjoys wide support in opinion polls, which Netanyahu is trying to ignore. Instead, he is doubling down on his dual mission of ethnic cleansing inGazaand consolidating his autocracy in Israel. And so, in an unpredictable twist, Lt Gen Zamir has cast himself as the unlikely leader of resistance to both goals – just like Netanyahu’s age-old military rivals.True to form, Netanyahu likes to keep his options open, while leaving his opponents with uneasy choices and telling different, and often contradictory, stories to different people. Israeli pundits debate whether he wants to end the war, reach a partial deal, or keep a low-level and less costly fight. Only two things are clear: the prime minister has an insatiable quest for power and longevity in office; and the death toll in Gaza from bombing and malnutrition keeps rising, while Israelis keep looking the other way.Aluf Benn is the editor-in-chief of HaaretzDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Big Dave was there to greet us.“Welcome to Chevening, JD,” he said.“Good to see you again,” I replied.“Let me show you, Usha and the kids around.”I have to say that I found the place a bit small and dingy, but I kept my thoughts to myself. I wasn’t there to upset anyone.“What’s this room?” I asked.Big Dave looked blank.‘We don’t want him’: Dance Against Vance protest at US vice-president’s Cotswolds holidayRead moreOne of his advisers chipped in. “It’s the bedroom,” she said.“That’s it,” Dave echoed. “It’s the bedroom”.“Nice,” I said. Maybe the bed had been a clue. Nothing gets past BD.After a short rest, we all went downstairs. BD suggested we go over to the private chapel.“Suits me,” I said. “Let’s get down to a half-hour power pray. Though best to agree the prayer agenda. Don’t want to confuse the almighty. OK. Are you ready? One, two, three, pray.”The next day started with a short walk around the garden, followed by top level discussions.“Let’s start with Gaza,” said Big Dave.“Fine by me. You go first.”“Well, the situation is appalling. What shall we do about it?”“No idea. The Donald wants to turn it into a Mediterranean Riviera resort.”“Maybe later. How about we both say how appalled we are and that we will have more talks about it soon?”“That works for me,” I said. “Let’s move on to Ukraine. It would be nice if that Zelenskyy guy was a bit more grateful for everything we’ve done for him.”“Mmm. I’m not sure that’s quite the best place to start. Could we agree the war has been terrible and that President Putin needs to accept a ceasefire?”“I’ll need to check that out with the president.”“Of course,” Big Dave nodded vigorously. “So that’s about it. Everything sorted. Where would the world be without us.How about a spot of fishing on the lake?”It was a top morning. Poor old Dave just stood there cluelessly holding his rod while the kids reeled in fish after fish.View image in fullscreenDavid Lammy fishing with JD Vance at Chevening.Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/PA“What am I doing wrong?” he groaned.I didn’t have the heart to tell him that I had previously arranged with the frogmen to attach a whole load of fish to my kids’ hooks. You don’t want to go disappointing the little ones.There was just time for one last round of competitive prayer and then it was time to move on.“It’s been good seeing you again, BD.”“And you, JD.”A few hours later, after a short visit to the quaint Hampton Court resort and spa next to the Thames – the kids somehow managed to get lost in the maze – and our motorcade pulled into our quaint little manor house in the village of Dean in the heart of the historic Cotswold mountains. There to greet us was our tour guide for the week. A rather creepy, needy guy called George Osborne.Ozzy is a strange fellow. Kept saying how he used to be chancellor of the exchequer and would I like to come on his podcast. Said it was him and David Cameron who were responsible for austerity.“Call me Mega,” he laughed nervously. “Making England Great Again.”I guess he’s just down on his luck these days. Nothing better to do than talk about how he used to be a someone and fix up bespoke holidays for the rich and famous like me. Still, I didn’t want to kick a man when he was down. So it was best to humour him. After all, he did arrange the rental.“I’ve arranged a small drinks reception,” he said. “Just a few Tory politicians who are keen to see you.”The pope’s last sacrifice in a lifetime of sacrifice: granting an audience to JD Vance |  John CraceRead morePersonally I couldn’t think of anything worse. Wasting time with a whole load of deadbeats who would be out of power for the foreseeable future. But needs must. I am doing God’s work.Later that evening I found myself corneredby some dude called Robert Jenrick, who insisted he was the real leader of the Tory party.“Don’t you hate foreigners?” he said. “I wouldn’t want my daughters to be surrounded by bearded blokes from inferior cultures who turn up here uninvited. No present company excepted. No offence.”“None taken.”I woke up the next morning and switched on the radio to the British Broadcasting Communism. How do the limeys cope with socialists taking over their airwaves? Just endless white noise about caring for foreigners. What’s wrong with a little recreational xenophobia? My irritation was interrupted by my phone ringing. A woman called Kemi Something.“I’m leader of the Tory party,” she pleaded.“What?”“I”m leader of the Tory party. Can we meet?”“Sorry. Busy. Am off to the Daylesford Farm shop. You can’t get any decent monterey jack cheese round here.”Click.Just then a policeman arrived. I’d been caught fishing without a licence. I could have been liable for a £2,500 fine. But he said he’d let me off this time. That’s the last time I trust Big Dave to arrange an expedition for me. As the police car pulled away, I saw a crowd of women waving pictures of me on placards. It was nice to be wanted. The Brits made me feel so welcome.

There’s a guy you don’t want to get too close to early in the morning. His breath reeked of cigarettes and booze. He seemed surprised I had come to the most dangerous country on the planet for my holidays. I suggested we start with a quick 45-minute prayer session to seek God’s guidance on rounding up foreigners and deporting them.It was almost time to leave for Scotland. Just needed to check in with the president ahead of hismeeting with Vladimir Putin.“How’s things, Mr President?” I asked.“All good here, JD.

But it was a very particular kind of failure she feared; one that follows a very particular kind of success. Living up to the fact of being Scotland’s first female first minister became, she writes in her new memoir, “almost an obsession”, which is arguably unhealthy but not unreasonable. To be the first woman (or indeed the first minority) in any field is to be uncomfortably aware of being on probation: the test case that sceptics will use to decide whether women in general can really hack it, but also the yardstick by which other women will judge whether representation actually makes a difference.You daren’t betray anything that looks like a sign of weakness, yet at the same time you’re endlessly under pressure to spill your guts on all the intimate stuff – miscarriage and menopause in Sturgeon’s case, pregnancy in high office for New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern, also the author of arecent memoir– lest other women feel you’re either holding out on useful information, making it all look too infuriatingly easy, or failing to do your bit to break some taboo. (Even Sturgeon, in an interview this week with the midlife women’spodcast The Shift, expressed surprise that, when she was figuring out how to manage menopausal symptoms in office, she couldn’t find anything to read about how other senior politicians had coped.) Suddenly, you’re not just a woman but an everywoman, supposed to magically embody every female voter who ever existed, even on issues where women in real life are impossibly divided – as they were over trans rights, the issue that ultimately holed Sturgeon’s premiership below the waterline.Representation can be a blessing and curse, even for a politician as gifted as Sturgeon undoubtedly has been. But is it also ultimately a distraction?Her book completes a trio of recent memoirs, alongside those of Ardern and Germany’sAngela Merkel, which feel like a final full stop on the end of an era in which putting a woman in power was expected somehow to change everything. All three at their peak were somewhat romantically held aloft as examples of a kinder, more emotionally literate politics: Merkel for opening her arms to Syrian refugees; Ardern for the unifying way sheled her countrythrough the immediate and potentially divisive aftermath of the Christchurch terrorist massacre;and Sturgeon for being the remain voter’s feminist yin to Boris Johnson’s laddish Brexiter yang.All three functioned at times as queens across the water for English leftwingers, wondering wistfully why they couldn’t have a leader like that. During the 2015 televised election debates in which Sturgeon took part, viewers furiously Googled whether it was possible to vote SNP south of the border. Merkel’s principled pushback against Donald Trump in his first presidency – remember that iconic image of herlooming commandinglyover a seated Trump at a G7 summit? – was as much admired and envied in parts of the UK as Ardern’s “zero Covid strategy” of sealing borders, at least until the latter was overwhelmed by new variants.Yet all three became bitterly polarising figures in time, as Sturgeon herself acknowledged to The Shift’s Sam Baker. The nature of the tribe in charge might have changed, but not the angry tribalism endemic in politics: so much for the patronising Barbieworld fantasy that if women ran the world, peace and love would rule the day.With hindsight, though, what all three of those pioneer female leaders really represented was a longing for someone to break the mould, and that hasn’t gone away. If anything, the impatience and frustration with mainstream politics building up in younger women suggests it is intensifying.Nicola Sturgeon’s immense political talent is undeniable. The nationalism was the problem | Martin KettleRead moreThe Scottish journalist Alex Massiewrote this week of the English tendency to idolise Sturgeon from a distance, even as Scots who experienced her government’s failings up close were losing patience with it. As an English journalist, I have to concede some truth in that. From a distance, it’s too easy to get hung up on the performance of leadership, at which she genuinely did excel, and forget about what it actually feels like to be governed by someone day in and day out. During the pandemic, I remember envying the way Scottish lockdown restrictions took into account children’s need for play, but more broadly the thought and seriousness that seemed to be going into Sturgeon’s policymaking when Johnson was still making jokes about squashing sombreros or turning a blind eye to drunken parties.Yet death rates in Scotlandweren’t noticeably betterthan in England, for reasons the Covid inquiry is still exploring. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, Ardern was failing to hit her much-vauntedtargets on child poverty, a reminder that personal values don’t necessarily trump the realities of a post-lockdown economy.The obvious moral to be drawn from all of this is that putting women on a pedestal simply because they’re women makes no more sense than taking lumps out of them for the same reason: that in a mature democracy, they would be judged simply on results. Since the least interesting thing about Kemi Badenoch’s increasingly erratic leadership of the Conservative party is her gender, perhaps it’s not too much to hope that we’re moving in that direction: that the joy of being the third or fourth or fifth woman through the door is that eventually people simply cease to care. But, if so, it will be the Sturgeons and the Arderns and the Merkels, with all their flaws, who paved the way.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

On Friday, there will be a two-minute silence at noon in the UK to honour the 80th anniversary of VJ Day. This is a moment not only for solemn remembrance, but also for reflection on the enduring bonds forged in the crucible of history – bonds that continue to resonate in our world today.At the darkest hour of the second world war, China and the UK fought on different frontsbut shared a common mission: to defend humanity against fascism and aggression. Millions of lives were lost, cities razed, and families torn apart. Yet in that darkness, courage and solidarity illuminated the way forward. The Chinese and British peoples stood shoulder to shoulder, united by sacrifice and a shared belief in freedom and justice.In Asia, Chinese forces made immense sacrifices to support allied efforts. In 1942, the Chinese Expeditionary Force marched over 1,500 gruelling kilometres through the jungles of Myanmarto rescue British forces trapped by Japanese troops. The campaign was costly, but it demonstrated China’s unwavering commitment to its allies.In Britain, thousands of Chinese seamen served with quiet courage in perilous convoys. They braved the freezing Atlantic to deliver fuel and supplies to British forces on the frontlines – often with little recognition and no promise of return. Their contribution remains a poignant chapter in our shared wartime history.One of the most moving examples of China-UK solidarity occurred in October 1942, when theLisbon Maru, a Japanese transport vessel carrying over 1,800 British prisoners of war, was mistakenly torpedoed by a US submarine. As the ship sank off the coast of Zhoushan in eastern China, local fishermen risked their lives, dodging volleys of Japanese gunfire, to rescue 384 survivors from the sea.In a letter to a family member ofa Lisbon Marusurvivor, President Xi Jinping commended this act of compassion and bravery as powerful proof of the wartime alliance between our countries and the enduring friendship between our peoples. Earlier this year, the story was brought to life for British audiencesin a documentary, The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru.View image in fullscreenPoster for The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru (2024)Photograph: Emei Film GroupBritish support for China’s resistance against Japanese aggression is equally etched in our collective memory. Across the UK, ordinary citizens formed aid organisations, held fundraisers, and sent donations to support the Chinese people. Among the most cherished names is George Hogg, a young man from Harpenden (aone-time reporterfor the Manchester Guardian). He journeyed to China to provide schooling and shelter for displaced children, dedicating his youth, passion and ultimately his life to a just cause. His internationalist spirit remains deeply cherished by the Chinese people.These moments of solidarity continue to inspire our relations today. Both China and the UK are permanent members of the UN security council, sharing a responsibility to uphold international peace and security. The UK was the first major western country to recognise the People’s Republic of China. Since we established full diplomatic ties in 1972, our people-to-people exchanges have flourished. In 2024, over 1.2m mutual visits were made. More than 200,000 Chinese studentsare studying in the UK, while over 50,000 British studentshave visited China for study programmes– long or short – over the past decade. Just last month, nearly 1,200 students from 61 UK secondary schools visited Chinaon an exchange programme– experiencing first-hand a millennia-old culture. In both countries, there is growing enthusiasm for more dialogue and engagement.With concerted efforts, China-UK relations have been put back on a path of improvement and renewal. At a time of global uncertainty, it is more important than ever to reaffirm our commitment to partnership. That means treating each other with mutual respect, managing differences properly, and responding to the aspirations of our peoples.It also means we need to deliver the outcomes of bilateral mechanisms such as the strategic dialogue, economic and financial dialogue, and energy dialogue, and also eliminate distractions, expand channels of communication, and strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation.Just as vital is our joint responsibility to safeguard the hard-won outcomes of the second world war and to uphold true multilateralism and an open global trading system. By working more closely to address global challenges like climate change and promote political solutions to regional hotspot issues, China and the UK can help inject new momentum into global peace and development.History has shown what China and the UK can achieve when we stand together. As we commemorate this historic anniversary, China is ready to work with the UK to carry forward the legacy of those who came before us.Let us honour the past not with nostalgia, but with action, telling the stories of courage and friendship that inspire new generations. Let us build a future where peace and prosperity prevail.The torch of friendship and solidarity, lit eight decades ago, must now light the way forward – for our two countries, for our peoples and for the world at large.Zheng Zeguang is Chinese ambassador to the UKDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s time to get offline and talk to each otherAlexander HurstIt’s tempting to scoff, but don’t dismiss the data. Modern man’s failure to forge real, meaningful friendships is bad for everyoneFri 15 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 07.47 EDTShareAt first I was startled when the psychologist Angelica Ferrara told me that most of the time it’s women, not men, who want to write abouther researchinto male loneliness. But this is the crux of the issue, isn’t it? That we men need to talk, and we don’t: not nearly enough, anyway.Since 1990, there has been a sharp decline in how many people men say they are close to, says Ferrara, who is a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford and a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics. In the US, two-thirds of men aged between 18 and 23 think thatnobody really knows them; one thirdhaven’t seen anyoneoutside their household in the past week; only afifth say they have friends they can really count on; and a staggering69% of young menthink “no one cares if men are OK”.Of course, women also experience this same loneliness, isolation and disconnection – at rates that are not far behind their male counterparts. In addition, many women in relationships with men find themselves doing something that Ferrara has named “mankeeping”, a term that hasrecently gone viral: picking up the emotional weight of being their male partner’s only intimate social connection. With this in mind, Ferrara has had her work dismissed as “himpathy” – in other words, too kind to adult men who should be able to look after themselves.While I understand the reflex to lash out and ask, “Why should a bunch of incels get so much attention?”, such a dismissal is a mistake. “Our lives are so interlinked,” as Ferrara put it to me: men’s failures to maintain close connections are hurting society at large.Since 2017, there has been amarked increasein the number of men inhabiting what some researchers refer to as the “man box”. That is, men who have deeply misogynistic beliefs about masculinity and gender roles: who want to know where their wife or girlfriend is at all times, who think they should always have the final say in a relationship, and who think gay men “are not real men”. The same survey found that 63% of men wished they were more “masculine”.Let me address men directly: this is our problem and our responsibility. We need to find a way out of this, and I think that starts with separating masculinity from “domination”. For too many men, domination is where masculinity is grounded. Dominating conversations online and offline, dominating the physical space around them, dominating women (“Your body, my choice,”Nick Fuentes tweetedafter Donald Trump’s second election victory). An identity formed around domination was always going to damage men, because it is fundamentally at odds with community. I think community is what whole swathes of alienated westerners are really yearning for deep down.In fact, I’d go so far as to say that domination is not only at odds with community, but with true confidence. Domination is something that the insecure seek as a means to generate confidence; the truly confident do not need it. Disturbingly, Taveeshi Gupta, the senior director of research at Equimundo, says being in the man box often correlates with a better sense of purpose, because men identify with the roles of provider and protector – an identification that women place on to men too, Gupta says. But what if we could get the same result by reframing this as care?“Men talk about their friendships with a lot of desire for what isnotthere,” says Ferrara, who, as part of her research, has conducted hundreds of interviews with men and their romantic partners. “One of the stereotypes that I combat, and that men combat too, is that men don’t need closeness.” I have male friendships whose natural setting is banter, and I have male friendships that involve deeper intellectual and emotional sharing, where we have found the space to just sit and talk, orrefaire le monde, as the French are fond of saying: to set the world straight.I do wonder if the ability to cultivate deeper connections can be taught. Ferrara and I are roughly the same age, and both from the US; neither of us encountered any kind of unit on identifying and discussing emotions in our elementary schooling. But she hit me with something surprising: among the men she has interviewed whodoreport having close relationships, a fair number of them (including a curious concentration of Canadians in particular) did talk about emotions and relationships at school.“There aren’t enough scripts for raising boys,” says Gupta. At an extremely young age, they talk openly about how they “love” their male friends, she says, and then society whisks that away from them and shoves them into a world where “they can’t have these relationships”. Sometimes that means literal scripts as well: Ferrara told me she could recall multiple examples from her childhood and adolescence of pop culture showing women discussing their feelings with each other, in shows such as Sex and the City. We both paused for a moment and tried to think of similar examples involving men. I couldn’t. Neither could she.We live in a cynical age, thick with essays about newly coined terms such as “heterofatalists”: people who are fed up with modern dating and are convinced there are no more “good men”. It is an age where the “manosphere” is full of grifters ready to prey on men’s loneliness and need for connection by selling them poor substitutes for real community, such as the sad bravado of masculinism. It would be devastating if all of this became a self-fulfilling narrative.It’s up to us – to men – to change the narrative. It has become a truism that it is tough to begin deep friendships later on in life, once we’re far away from the crucible of shared classrooms or university campuses. But it’s on us to make the effort to change this: to reach out, to ask deeper questions, to create that absent sense of community – hopefully in offline “third spaces” rather than online ones. We may not have had to face a glass ceiling above us, but too often we’ve put ourselves behind glass walls of our own making. Let’s shatter them.Alexander Hurst is a GuardianEuropecolumnistExplore more on these topicsMenOpinionPsychologyLonelinessEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Shall we?Lownie’s unauthorised 400-page book goes deep into the history of the royal family’s biggest liability, a man who, per the author’s sources, screams at his staff (sample quote: “who’s the fucking idiot who cut the meat up?”) in a way reminiscent of no one more so than that other famously rude member of the royal family, the late Princess Margaret. It covers the battle for Royal Lodge, in which the late queen’s second son is depicted as hanging on by his fingernails to the 30-room property in Windsor while behind the scenes Prince William works to get him out.Disappointingly, there are no specifics as to the exact nature of the “rude” remark Andrew allegedly made to Kate, the Princess of Wales. But the duke’s many eccentricities are itemised, including the stuffed animals on his bed well into adulthood, the daily “air showers” in which he sits on the balcony with his eyes shut sucking in air, and the enduring oddness of his relationship with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, whose long life of grift and overspending, according to Lownie, includes running up £4,000 in extra baggage charges by taking 25 suitcases on holiday. Ryanair would never allow it.On Andrew’s friendship with Epstein, the author writes, shrewdly I think, that “the prince was a useful idiot who gave [Epstein] respectability and access to political leaders and business opportunities”. Per the book, Andrew is venal, thick and often just nasty. One story recounts a camping trip he took at the age of 13, during which he threw his friends’ groundsheets in the river as a joke. “He thinks he’s funny, handsome and clever,” says the source of the story. “And he isn’t … He was a tosser.” Which, funnily enough, if Lownie is to be believed, is the same word used by Prince William to describe his uncle.TuesdayTo the country’s second royal family, the House of Beckham, where trouble comes this week in the form of the latest round of hostilities between eldest son Brooklyn and the rest of the clan. It’s now jumped from online snubs and coded insults to IRL estrangement as Brooklyn renews his wedding vows in America in a ceremony to which none of his family are invited.The real story, however, continues to play out most forcefully on Instagram, a mirror world in which the family arguably lives their fullest and most meaningful life. It’s no trivial breach, in these circumstances, that Romeo and Cruz have blocked Brooklyn on the platform (they have also blocked Brooklyn’s wife, Nicola Peltz). It’s hugely significant, as theSun noted this week, that Cruz dropped the comment “wrong brother, mate” when a follower teased him on Insta for changing jobs every five minutes.And now, this:Victoria Beckham, who has been faithfully liking her oldest’s son’s interminable cooking videos even as the rest of the family has held firm and ignored him, has finally hit her ceiling. At the time of writing, Brooklyn’s mother hasn’t liked any of the photos of the renewal ceremony to which she and the rest of the Beckhams were excluded.View image in fullscreenKemi: ‘No, you can’t have a Flake.’Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PAWednesdayHang on to your attention spans, a second season of With Love, Meghan is coming down the pike on Netflix and promises to be even more enchanting and whimsical than the first. Per the trailer, it looks as if Mindy Kaling is out after appearing to irritate Meghan in the first season, and her rival lifestyle influencer Chrissy Teigen is in to help Meghan get out of her “comfort zone” by slicing a loaf of bread and handling a salad. The show also promises “a confession about Prince Harry’s diet”. (Spoiler alert: he doesn’t like lobster.)To followers of the Archewell story, it might come as a surprise to learn that a second season has been ordered at all, although the volume of hate watchers of the first season probably pushed it towards modest success. Season two comes at a moment when Netflix is,reportedly, downgrading its relationship with the coupleby moving from an original deal reported to have been worth $100m to a less lucrative “first look” arrangement after a slew of projects never came to fruition.ThursdayIt’s A-level results day and while teenagers celebrate their results and weather the opinion pieces, Tatler magazine puts together ahelpful reminder of royal exam successover the ages. Let’s start with the king, bless him, who had a notoriously rough ride at Gordonstoun, where he passed five O-levels and two A-levels, achieving a B in history and a C in French.A generation down and the country’s most expensive education won Prince William three A-levels, in geography (A), art (B) and biology (C), while his brother managed two, a B in art and a D in geography – and unlike his father, made the sensible decision not to use the royal wild card to go on to Cambridge. And while it isn’t known what grades Prince Andrew achieved with his six O-levels and three A-levels, in 2008 the duke’s daughter, Princess Eugenie, gained by far the most impressive A-level tally of any recent royal with two As and a B in art, history of art, and English. As Tatler notes, the palace was so thrilled by this anomaly “they actually sent out a statement so they could tell the world”.FridayAnalarm callput out by English Heritage announces the demise of the traditional British pudding, and until recently I’d have said not a moment too soon. I am just old enough to remember someone putting a steaming bowl of yellow slop in front of me and calling it “spotted dick”. Young people who grew up eating Shake Shack frozen custard have no idea what “custard” used to mean, or encountered the spirit-sinking associations that come with the phrase “hot pudding”. Anyway, after eating an amazing sticky toffee pudding innocently ordered by my 10-year-old on the Isle of Wight last week, I have completely changed my mind and am joining the campaign.

The increasing threat to our health, our environments and wildlife must be addressed.Fri 15 Aug 2025 12.05 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 19.21 EDTShareBy ensuringthe collapse of UN talksseeking the first legally binding agreement on tackling plastic pollution, blockers in Geneva have failed the next generation. Most states are willing, even determined, to act. But the US joined petrostates obstructing action. Their children too will live to regret that.To say that plastics are part of our lives from cradle to grave is an understatement: microplastics have been foundin placentas, as well as blood and breast milk. While we can’t yet be certain of the full impact of the substances, we know that many have been linked to health effects and that foetuses, infants and young children are highly vulnerable. Microplastics have been shown to damage human cells in laboratory experiments, anda review published this monthdocumented how exposure is associated with increased risks of miscarriage, stillbirth, birth defects, impaired lung growth, childhood cancer and fertility problems as an adult.Yet even as our awareness of the danger to human and planetary health soars, so does plastic production, which is expected to triple – to more than a billion tonnes a year – within 35 years. Half of the plastic produced annually is for single-use items. In part, this growth is because petrostates see petrochemicals as their solution to maintaining demand given the shift towards renewables and nuclear in power generation.Three years ago, the prospect of a binding global treaty brought hope to all those concerned about the impact of plastics. But subsequent discussions failed and in Geneva this week, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and others insisted that actionshould be limited to tackling waste– which can only have awholly inadequate impact– not curbing production and halting the use of toxic chemicals in their manufacture. The US insisted that only voluntary measures were acceptable. Rightly, that was not enough for delegates from “high ambition” states, which include those in the EU, Britain, Canada and most of the global south. The insistence on a consensus decision allowed a minority to prevent the action needed.It is deeply disappointing that no agreement could be reached, and that none lies in sight, though perhaps not surprising, especially when diplomacy and multilateralism are struggling more generally. Many of those attending concluded that no deal was better than a weak one which might allow the pressure for real change to dissipate. They will continue their push, though not necessarily through the same mechanism, given this second failure. Some think another UN forum might be more successful.We cannot afford to despair. Campaigners also note that it took eight years of talks to agree an amendment on hydrofluorocarbons to the Montreal protocol on ozone-depleting substances. Some hope that China could play a critical role in making a shift: it is one of the world’s biggest producers of plastics, but it is less reliant on them, and Beijing could benefit from being regarded as a leader on this global environmental issue. In the meantime, countries can and must take action unilaterally, and within blocs, to reduce plastic usage. Some, like Colombia,are already taking significant steps.If the record number ofindustry lobbyistsin Geneva was a depressing sign of the entrenched interests that all who care about this issue must battle against, it was also proof that plastics producers know that change is possible and that the case for it grows stronger by the day. They have fought it off for now, but they must not prevail.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsOpinionPollutionUnited NationsFossil fuelsWasteHealtheditorialsShareReuse this content"

Producers need to revive the fresher and lighter vintages that their medieval ancestors once harvestedFri 15 Aug 2025 12.04 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 14.52 EDTShareThese are always anxious weeks in the Bordeaux vineyards, where 15% of France’s wine is grown, including in celebrated places like Chateau Latour and Chateau Mouton-Rothschild. In earlier years, this ritual anxiety among the region’s winegrowers had a pleasingly folkloric quality. In the middle of August, the grapes would ripen and their colour start to turn. About 45 days from now, tradition dictates, it will be time to start picking the 2025 vintage. As the wine writerEdmund Penning-Rowsellput it: “To pick or not to pick is the most momentous decision in the winemaking year in Bordeaux.”This once timeless rhythm is now collapsing. Part of the problem is theclimate crisis. Bordeaux still benefits from its moderate Atlantic climate. But south-west France is getting much hotter and drier. Even in the Gironde region, maximum temperatures have been close to 40C at times this past week. Adaptation, in the form of hardier grapes and greater crop diversity, feels unavoidable.A much larger challenge, however, is today’schanging wine market. Demand for red wine in general, and for the full-bodied, long maturing red wines with generally high alcohol content that are synonymous with Bordeaux in particular, has slumped. This has affected not just the signaturepremiers crusin which monarchs and the global rich have always invested, but also the vineyards producing the ordinary Bordeaux red wines sold in supermarkets around the globe. For a region whose wine output is 85% red, this is an existential crisis.Bordeauxproducesaround 650m bottles of wine each year; but it currently sells only 500m. Demand for red wine in France has fallen by 38% in the past five years; in the 10 years to 2023 the fall was 45%. Nor is the slump confined to France. Demand in the Chinese market hashalvedsince 2017.US tariffswill undoubtedly hit the 20% of Bordeaux exports that previously went across the Atlantic. These consumption changes are likely to be irreversible, at least in the short and medium term.A popular response for many would be to slash prices. Global Bordeaux prices soared outrageously in the Chinese boom years. But with consumers turning away in droves, and too many producers operating at a loss, price cuts havenot reshaped the market. With aid from the French government and the EU, about 15% of Bordeaux vineyards have instead been dug up and put to new uses, including olives and kiwifruit, since 2019.In the nick of time, there is now a more traditional but also genuinely radical idea – to produce lighter and less tannic wines. History is on this idea’s side. Bordeaux reds have been known for centuries in Britain asclaret. But this much debated word dates from when England’s Henry II and his descendants ruled in medieval Aquitaine. Back then, the reds of Bordeaux were often lighter, fresher wines known asclairet, somewhere between a modern red and a rosé,to be drunk young, which for the English meant soon after they arrived from their voyage from France.Small amounts of clairet are still produced in parts of the Bordeaux region even now. Today there are moves to expand production with the aim of winning new consumers who have rejected heavier reds. Clairet’s advocates say it should be drunk within a couple of years and should be drunk chilled. Traditional claret drinkers will upend their decanters in disgust. But clairet sounds just the thing to accompany a barbecue over a warm summer weekend.Explore more on these topicsWineOpinionClimate crisisBordeaux holidaysFranceFrench food and drinkeditorialsShareReuse this content"

The way I am is no statement, no protest, no challengeFri 15 Aug 2025 10.54 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 14.52 EDTShareRe your article (‘I’ve been spat on’: gender non-conforming women tell of toilet abuse after UK’s supreme court ruling, 12 August), while it is possible that these women’s experiences are as a result of the recent supreme court ruling, this has been happening to me and others I know for a long time. A very long time.My experience as a gender non-conforming 37-year-old woman is that, since I was about eight, I have been regularly mistaken for a boy or man, and that a few times a year, these incidents are deeply embarrassing to me or involve someone being openly hostile.For example, in 2022, when flying to the US, I was detained for an enhanced search because they did not believe that I was female, as stated in my passport. I was humiliated to the point of tears, not least because I had recently shaved my head for brain surgery for a tumour and had a prominent scar.I have long lived in a world where I expect to be mistaken for a man and feel on edge as a result. My crimes? Being 5ft 8in, slim-ish, with short hair, an angular face, a deeper voice, and preferring loose clothing. Perhaps my walk is a little confident. The chromosomes remain XX.This isn’t about the trans or non-binary debate. The real issue is that in this country, we have an extremely reductive view of what even a biological woman should look like, sound like and dress like. To an extent, the challenge to binaries has unfortunately and bizarrely played a role in reducing the visual and social footprint of natal womanhood even further. I am regularly asked by well-meaners my pronouns too – something I find just as insulting.The way I am is no statement, no protest, no challenge. It is simply how I have always been. Comfy, lazy, functional. Why should those be the preserve of men?Felicity HawksleyYorkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Then came ‘shrinking girl summer’ – is everyone getting smaller except me?, 10 August). Once again, a healthy, intelligent woman is made to feel not good enough by society because she is larger than a size 10.Then came anger, not with Stokes but with the media and brands that propagate a culture of skinny worship. I was born with a rare physical disability and have spent years coming to terms with the way my body is. I look disabled, I have scars from operations and a spinal curve surgeons couldn’t straighten, and I use mobility aids. To me, Stokes presents as an attractive, successful, healthy woman who is non-disabled (although this is her private business) with the good fortune to have two children. I wish Stokes and others could see themselves in that vein. Granted, it took me years to be happy in my own skin and see the strengths of my body, everything I’ve been through and the pleasure it can give and receive, but it’s doable.We are living in dark times when non-disabled women and men are wrecking their mental health and putting their physical health in danger with fad diets and weight-loss jabs, shrinking themselves to an ever-hungry and cold status to please others’ gazes and get likes on TikTok and Instagram. As a society we should be ashamed that we are engendering this, putting people at risk of eating disorders, malnutrition and mental health issues.We only have one body and if you’re fortunate enough to have one that works properly, you’ve won the jackpot.Name and address suppliedSelf-loathing, shame, isolation and the desire for slenderness are not an intrinsic or inevitable aspect of being fat, as features such as Rose Stokes’ seem to suggest. They are caused by fatphobia. This has been ruthlessly exploited by weight-loss industries, including the contemporary manufacturers of GLP-1 drugs. These purveyors are not called to account when their products fail or harm their users. Instead, fat people are made to feel responsible. We should have tried harder.For a more balanced view, I invite Guardian editors, writers and readers to consider a social movement that has been active for at least 50 years and which takes a critical view of the obesity‑industrial complex.The scholarly field of fat studies and the public health model known as “health at every size” are offshoots. There are many of us working in these areas, providing a more nuanced and hopeful understanding of fat subjectivity.Charlotte CooperLondonRose Stokes’ article strikes a chord across the femisphere. I would add that body dysmorphia has never been confined to women whose bodies don’t conform to skinny standards. The body-positivity movement liberated all women from these impossible strictures. It’s no coincidence that as soon as it arrived, and women began to take up more and powerful space, drugs were pumped out to make sure we take less.Danuta KeanHastings, East SussexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

After the outburst of negativity about tinnitus distress on your letters page (10 August), we feel compelled to put more than an element of good news into the discussion. Being able to hear tinnitus at some time is almost universal. Persistent distressing tinnitus is due in large part to the meaning ascribed to it and the subsequent strong emotions evoked, which establish a conditioned response that does not habituate. Sounds that are threatening demand our constant attention.Tinnitus retraining therapy, which follows the science of the Jastreboff model and our research, has been very successful. While there is no quick fix, this is a slow fix that really works when patiently followed, and is used by audiologists around the world. Visittinnitus.organdtinnitus-pjj.comto make up your own mind. You do not have to live with it.Jonathan HazellHonorary consultant neuro-otologist, University College London (retired);formerdirector, Tinnitus and Hyperacusis Centre, LondonPawel JastreboffVisiting professor,UCL; professor emeritus, department of otolaryngology, Emory University School of MedicineMy tinnitus started after the use of a plug-in mouse-repellant device that emits a high-pitch frequency and which, apparently, humans cannot hear. It continued mostly as a high-pitch constant noise just like the sound of the plug-in, but spiked once and sounded like a plane was about to crash into the room.When I can’t bear the high-pitched sound, I put in myNHSear devices that give off a white noise “shuffling” sound, cancelling out the noise in my head. I have chosen to live with it rather than suffer anxiety and distress because of it, as I know it will never go away.Karen RoyallWigton, CumbriaI am 73. I don’t know how long I have had tinnitus, but I certainly had it after a spell in a woodworking factory, unprotected, in 1970, and that’s 55 years and counting. Since then it has always been present, a continuous experience of multiple, swirling high-pitched whistles (like standing on the shore of an electronic ocean) accompanied by the tick-tick-tick of a pocket watch. It is at its worst when I am surrounded by silence, at night.But it has also conspired to make my presence in company more difficult, as my brain gets older and finds it more difficult to select the sounds it needs to focus on. I no longer go to parties and cannot hear in loud pubs or restaurants. It masks dialogue when I watch TV or films.I have given up expecting a cure. I don’t even expect my GP to care about it. Their indifference, derived, I think, from their impotence in the face of it, makes it embarrassing to refer to it. But its impact on my life, both working and social, has been huge and entirely negative.

But these are the ways I’ve found hope this summer amid the gloom, 8 August), I seek ways of finding hope in the face of overwhelming news. Jonathan rightly finds hope in sport and popular music.There’s a category he misses. We are in the midst of theBBC Proms, and, here in Scotland, theEdinburgh International Festival, where, earlier this month, a large orchestra of teenagers from New York showed whatjoy can come from classical music. The young folk from NYO2 practised, worked together, took instruction from an inspiring conductor and produced a brilliant, ebullient wall of sound and harmony. And they had a whale of a time.TheProms, too, offer new creativity alongside well-known favourites. Look, if you will, at the pleasure on the faces of the Prommers. There is hope, and one of its forms is classical music.Colin BrownEdinburghI couldn’t agree more with Jonathan Freedland. My family and I recently went to Stratford to watch the Royal Shakespeare Company’s stellar production ofThe Winter’s Tale. With its powerful depiction of the terrible evil that humans are capable of, as well as the abilities of both love and time to heal, Shakespeare’s sublime words reminded us that in deepest despair, we must indeed try to glimpse the stars.Catherine JessopLondonOur most used banner in TynesideExtinction Rebellionis entitled “Climate anxiety? The remedy is action.” Jonathan Freedland writes of watching cricket and seeing the “obsessive pursuit of excellence” as an antidote to the problems overwhelming the world.We believe that action is the best remedy, both to give us hope and to tackle the problems. And as an example of the pursuit of excellence, let us praise the action of the532 people arrestedin Parliament Square last weekend: this is what gives me hope.Tony WaterstonNewcastle upon TyneReading Jonathan Freedland’s piece is an excellent example of escapism and the vision it promotes of what humans can achieve in the most desperate of circumstances. But the determination of us little folk to fight against the odds is no match for the greed, ignorance, short-termism, political cowardice and persuasive distraction of the world’s ruling elite.Unfortunately for life on Earth, that balance will not shift until the ivory towers of the powerful are no longer proof against lethal heat, rampant disease, limited habitable space (with consequent global strife), dead oceans and catastrophic climate events. Then the mighty will share with us all a future that is not uncertain – but very short.Peter LoweNewcastle upon TyneI loved Jonathan Freedland’s piece. Escapism is essential for all. It reminded me of the Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief album, which containsa sketchbetween George Bernard Shaw, James Whistler and Oscar Wilde in front of the Prince of Wales: “Your majesty is like a stream of bat’s piss.” “What?” he exclaims. “I merely meant, your majesty, that you shine out like a shaft of gold whilst all around is dark.”We probably don’t need more bat piss but we (as in the world) have had enough dark. Whether it’s cricket or the Lionesses or Victoria Mboko’s tennis, we should all delight in the things that give us pleasure and help us avoid a doom scroll of news. (Also worth listening to the cheese shop sketch on the same album, when it all gets too much.)James KyddLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Turner was sentenced in July to five years in prison with three years of probation.The two were initiallyarrestedin May 2024 on theft charges after a Swat raid on Kingston’s South Florida mansion. Investigators told the court that Kingston used social media from April 2023 to March 2024 to arrange purchases of luxury items, and invited sellers to his Florida homes with the promise to feature them and their merchandise on his accounts. When it came time to pay for the items, such as a bulletproof Cadillac Escalade or an Audemars Piguet watch, Kingston or his mother texted the sellers fake wire receipts.During her trial, Turner admitted to falsifying wires for her son, which she claimed was an effort to protect him from scammers by delaying payments for luxury items. Kingston refused to testify. As evidence, the prosecution presented texts from Kingston to his mother that read “I told you to make [a] fake receipt” followed by “so it [looks] like the transfer will be there in a couple [of] days”.Before the judge delivered his sentence, Kingston apologized and said he had learned from his actions, according to theAssociated Press. His lawyer had previously asked the judge for home confinement, due to the non-violent nature of the crime and the fact that Kingston had paid back most of the people he defrauded.Born in Miami and raised in his parents’ native Kingston, Jamaica, the singer remains most famous for his 2007 single Beautiful Girls, which topped the Billboard charts. He has released four albums and collaborated with the likes of Nicki Minaj and Chris Brown. In 2011, he scored a modest hit with Justin Bieber on the track Eenie Meenie.According to federal court records, Turner pleaded guilty in 2006 to bank fraud for stealing over $160,000, and served nearly 18 months in prison. Turner and Kingston have been sued multiple times for failure to pay for luxury items, most recently by a Florida entertainment systems company in February 2024.Explore more on these topicsFloridaUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

A second asylum seeker has since been charged with sexual assault.During a hearing before Mr Justice Eyre on Friday, Epping district council’s lawyer Philip Coppel KC said the site had ceased to be used as a hotel – its “sole lawful use”. This, he argued, was a “clear breach” of planning law.He also cited the concerns of local people, as well as the safety of the asylum seekers themselves among the justifications for an immediate ban.The hotel’s owners said the planning issue was central – and was insufficient to justify the “exceptional step” of an immediate interim injunction. It could be dealt with via conventional enforcement action or at a final injunction hearing, they argued.Piers Riley-Smith, representing Somani Hotels, said asylum seekers had been housed at the Bell for about a year and a half without issue – with problems only arising recently.He told the court: “In reality, this is an injunction by the council against the [recent] protests and the civil unrest. The council has targeted the wrong institution.”Coppel claimed the placement of asylum seekers put the local community at “enhanced risk”. He said the alleged sexual offences took place close to the hotel – and that there were schools with about 1,800 children in similar proximity.“Having this sort of thing go on, with such a concentration of schools, with no measures to stop a repetition is not acceptable. That risk needs to be removed … parents have the well-founded apprehension that the continued placement of asylum seekers at the Bell hotel represents a risk to those students.”Coppel said the asylum seekers themselves were not safe. “The occupants, some of whom are vulnerable, are being housed in circumstances that can be described as intimidating. It is the last thing they need.”Riley-Smith said his client believed local people’s concerns were genuine. He said: “It is clear recent protests have expanded far beyond the local community and have gone into concerns about wider ideological or political issues.”He argued that, if there were an urgent need to remove the asylum seekers and return the site to a conventional hotel because of fears about criminality, it would need to be shown the average asylum seeker had a greater propensity to commit crime than the average hotel guest. There was no such evidence, Riley-Smith told the court.Moreover, he said, were protests to be used as a reason to grant an urgent injunction against housing asylum seekers, this could be repeated at any place being used to welcome them across the country.Eyre reserved judgment until next Tuesday and ordered the hotel’s owners not to take in any new asylum seekers before then.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumFar rightLocal governmentEssexEnglandShareReuse this content"

Cloudbursts have the potential to wreak havoc by causing intense flooding and landslides, affecting thousands of people in the mountainous regions.Experts say these intense downpours have become more frequent in recent years, partly owing to the climate crisis, and that the damage caused has also increased because of unplanned development in mountain regions.Dozens were injured as the deluge destroyed homes in villages in Buner, where authorities declared a state of emergency. Ambulances have transported 56 bodies to local hospitals, according to a government statement.View image in fullscreenAn aerial image shows Buner district submerged in flood water after flash floods.Photograph: APRescuers backed by boats and helicopters worked to reach stranded residents.

Bilal Faizi, a emergency service spokesperson in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said rescuers worked for hours to save 1,300 tourists after they were trapped by flash flooding and landslides in the Siran valley in Mansehra district on Thursday.The Gilgit-Baltistan region has been hit by multiple floods since July, sparking landslides along the Karakoram Highway, a key trade and travel route linking Pakistan and China that is used by tourists. The region is home to scenic glaciers that provide 75% of Pakistan’s stored water supply .Despite repeated government warnings about landslides and flash floods, many people still visited popular resorts in flood-hit areas in north and north-west Pakistan. A study released this week by World Weather Attribution, a network of international scientists, found rainfall from 24 June to 23 July was 10% to 15% heavier in Pakistan because of global heating. In 2022, the country’s worst monsoon season on record killed more than 1,700 people and caused an estimated $40bn (£29.5bn) in damage.1:06Dozens dead and hundreds missing after cloudburst triggers flood in Kashmir – videoIn Indian-administered Kashmir, rescuers searched for missing people in the remote Himalayan village of Chositi on Friday after60 people died in flash floods, officials said. Scores of people are missing.At least 300 people were rescued on Thursday after a powerful cloudburst sparked floods and landslides, but the operation was halted overnight. Officials said many missing people were believed to have been washed away.At least 50 seriously injured people were treated in local hospitals, many of them rescued from a stream filled with mud and debris. A disaster management official, Mohammed Irshad, said the number of missing people could increase.Meanwhile, more heavy rain is forecast for the area and is expected to cause flooding.Chositi in Kishtwar district is the last village accessible to motor vehicles on the route of an annual Hindu pilgrimage to a mountainous shrine. Officials said the pilgrimage, which began on 25 Julyand was scheduled to end on 5 September, was suspended.Flood waters swept away the main community kitchen set up for the pilgrims, as well as dozens of vehicles and motorbikes. More than 200 pilgrims were in the kitchen at the time of the flood, which also damaged or washed away many of the homes clustered in the foothills, officials said.View image in fullscreenRescue workers use earthmovers in the search for missing people after flash floods in Kishtwar district of Indian-administered Kashmir.Photograph: Farooq Khan/EPASneha, who gave only one name, said her husband and a daughter were swept away as flood water came down the mountain.

It is a surprisingly invasive process. Although it is known that many women experience abdominal pain and slight bleeding during implantation, the process itself had never been observed before.”Embryo implantation occurs when a fertilised egg attaches to the lining of the uterus about six to 12 days after ovulation.A platform that allows embryos to implant outside the uterus under controlled conditions was developed by the researchers. This platform, based on a gel made partly by collagen and uterine tissue, then enabled real-time fluorescence imaging and analysis of the embryo’s interactions with its environment.Embryos digging in to the uterine matrixAfter this, researchers carried out experiments with human and mouse embryos to compare the two implantation processes. They discovered that while a mouse embryo sticks to its surface, a human embryo penetrates the uterine tissue completely before growing from the inside out.The study also showed that during the implantation process, the human embryo released enzymes that broke down the surrounding tissue, and that this embryo also exerted traction forces on its environment.The failure of the implantation process is one of the maincauses of infertility, accounting for about 60% of miscarriages. According to the researchers, this study, which helps to improve understanding of the implantation process, could have a significant impact on fertility rates.Amélie Godeau, a researcher and co-first author of the study, said: “We observe that the embryo pulls on the uterine matrix, moving and reorganising it. It also reacts to external force cues. We hypothesise that contractions occurringin vivomay influence embryo implantation.”Explore more on these topicsScienceFertility problemsHealthBiologyWomen's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

Over two decades of polar research, he has always felt “relaxed and at home” on ice. But the accelerating climate breakdown is beginning to erode that sense of security.While mean global temperatures have not yet breached the 1.5C Paris target, the Arctic blew past that landmark long ago. Svalbard isheating seven times fasterthan the world average.View image in fullscreenDr Arwyn Edwards examines a sample of microbe-rich ‘cryoconite’ from glacier ice on Svalbard.Photograph: Ben MartynogaTime is running out to understand these fragile ecosystems and the trillions of dollars in climate costs they could unleash.Edwards describes the cold-adapted microbes he studies as “the watchkeepers and arch-agitators of Arctic demise”. Recent research implicates snow and ice-dwelling microbes in positive feedback loops that can accelerate melting. With more than70% of the planet’s freshwater stored in ice and snow– and billions of lives sustained by glacier-fed rivers – this has profound implications everywhere.Yet not all polar microbes amplify global heating. Emerging evidence suggests that certain populations are – for now – applying a brake to methane emissions.Frozen rainforestsUntil recent decades, most scientists assumedArcticice and snow were largely devoid of life. On Longyearbreen, a Svalbard glacier close to the world’s most northerly town, Edwards digs through the remnants of last winter’s snow pack, to explain how that assumption missed the mark.Edwards notes that allfresh snowfall contains microbesand, remarkably, microbes themselves can trigger snowflake formation. Each cubic centimetre of snow on the glacier contains hundreds to thousands of living cells, he says, and typically four times as many viruses – a microbial habitat as complex as topsoil. “The organisms that can survive here are very, very evolutionarily advanced,” Edwards says.During summer, snow surfaces can host red-pigmented algae that swim up and down through surface layers, seeking sunlight for photosynthesis without getting burned. Intense blooms create the phenomena known as ‘watermelon snow’ or “blood snow”, first described by Aristotle.View image in fullscreenMicrobe-rich ‘cryoconite granules’, also called ‘rainforests of the ice’, embedded in glacier ice.Photograph: Ben MartynogaBeneath the snow, Edwards’ shovel hits solid glacier ice – another rich habitat where microbes flourish despite intensely low temperatures, minimal nutrients, and extreme oscillations between perpetual winter darkness and the endless days of Arctic summer. “If I look at a glacier surface, I don’t see ice. I see … a three dimensional bioreactor,” Edwards says.Embedded in the ice are dark, soil-like fragments. Despite their unremarkable appearance, these “cryoconite granules” have been called the “frozen rainforests” of the ice. Each granule is a self-sustaining ecosystem in minature, containing diverse bacteria, fungi, viruses, protists and even tiny animals like tardigrades and worms.These microbial communities can exert influence on a global scale but Edwards is frustrated that many glaciologists treat them as mere “impurities”. “Oceanographers would not treat fish in the sea as impurities,” he says.Microbes that live in surface ice and snow produce dark-coloured pigments to harness sunlight and shield themselves from damaging UV light. They also trap dark-coloured dust and debris. Together, these factors darken snow and ice, causing it to absorb more heat and melt faster – a process known as “biological darkening”.Microbes also respond to global changes, such as increased nutrients fromair pollution, wildfire smoke orwind-blown dustfrom receding glaciers and expanding drylands. “The snowpack chemistry is now different to preindustrial era snow,” Edwards says. Rising temperatures and longer melt seasons caused by global heating further accelerate the growth of ice-darkening microbes.Together, these factors have the potential to trigger an amplifying positive feedback loop: ice-darkening microbes nudge up temperatures and accelerate melt, exposing more nutrient-rich debris that encourage the growth of yet more microbes, which darken the surface further still.View image in fullscreenEdwards steps over a melt channel beneath a Svalbard glacier.Photograph: Ben MartynogaEach summer, a biologically darkened zone, visible from space, covering at least 100,000 sq km, appears on the south-western part of the Greenland ice sheet. According to a2020 study, microbes there are responsible for 4.4 to 6.0 gigatons of runoff, representing up to 13% of total melt, from an ice mass that holds enough water to raise global sea levels by more than 7 metres. These effects areacknowledged in IPCC reportsbut not yet incorporated into climate projection models.Across the European Alps, Himalayas, central Asia and beyond, at least 2 billion people depend on glacial meltwater for drinking water, agriculture and hydropower. Yet even if the world meets Paris targets, half these glaciers willnot survivethis century.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In many parts of the Arctic, glaciers and permafrost cap vast underground stores of this potent greenhouse gas, preventing its release. Recent studies have also revealed that microbes thriving in the cold, dark, high-pressure worldunderneath glacierscan produce large volumes of fresh methane. Thawing permafrost and receding glaciers can triggerpreviously unanticipatedmethane emissions from deep underground.Across the fjord from Longyearbyen, Prof Andy Hodson, of the University Centre in Svalbard, demonstrates this at a collection of “pingos” – mounds formed when pressurised groundwater surges upward through frozen ground. The water that emerges is saturated with methane. Hodson likens the effect to glaciers and ice “fracking the landscape and pushing this gas out. We’ve got methane pissing out the ground from wherever fluids can migrate from beneath the permafrost.”On cue, a sudden belch of methane disturbs the surface of a pingo pool. “I’m not going to say there’s a 50 petagram methane bomb about to go off,” Hodson says. But with recent estimates suggesting emissions from Arctic feedback loops could add$25-70tnto climate costs, the stakes couldn’t be higher.View image in fullscreenProf Andy Hodson stands on a natural methane seep known as a ‘pingo’.Photograph: Ben MartynogaOne reason Hodson remains relatively calm about this particular site is because he and colleaguesdiscovered recentlythat specific microbial communities living in the pingo can out-compete methane-producing microbes and actively consume methane. “This is where the methanotrophs [‘methane eaters’] are really saving the day,” Hodson says. Methanotrophs will certainly not curtail emissions everywhere but without them, much more methane would escape.‘A terminally ill glacier’Standing on the surface of Foxfonna, a central Svalbard glacier, Edwards describes how the ice surface here is 4 metres lower than it was last summer, with the glacier much diminished since his first visit in 2011. “This is a terminally ill glacier,” says Edwards, “This is palliative, and yet nobody cares.”Like every animal body, each glacier hosts its ownunique microbiome, sometimes containing species found nowhere else. As Edwards searches in vain for a particular microbial habitat he studied last year, likely lost to melt and erosion, he likens his experience to coral reef biologists watching their study sites bleach and die. These imperilled snow- and ice-dwelling microbial species not only have intrinsic and scientific value, but potentially tremendous economic worth, too. Their genetic adaptations to extreme cold, darkness and low nutrients represent a library of possible biotechnological solutions for medicine, industry and waste management. As global heating advances, society is rapidly losing its opportunity to use, study, and conserve this unique trove of biological diversity.Edwards advocates for an international repository to preserve polar microbial diversity – analogous to Svalbard’s Global Seed Vault, which stores crop varieties in permafrost vaults nearby. “Ultimately, when I retire or die, I want [a microbial repository] to act as an enduring resource for future generations, because they will not have this glacier or that glacier, or that glacier over there,” he says, gesturing to the huge, endangered landscape.Many visitors come to witness Svalbard’s spectacular wildlife, which remains abundant – for now. On a boat trip to a central fjord, we encounter more than 80 beluga whales. Yet even this thriving pod depends on invisible microbes: the whales feed on fish that consume plankton nourished by marine microbes, which themselves depend on nutrients released by nearby glaciers – habitats partly controlled by the microbes Edwards studies.View image in fullscreenNordenskiöldbreen, a glacier in central Svalbard.Photograph: Ben MartynogaIt’s a reminder that polar microbes don’t just influence ice melt and global climate; they underpin entire ecosystems. Without them, this abundance would vanish.Edwards compares his regular trips to the Arctic to visiting his father suffering from vascular dementia in a care home. Each visit revealed further loss. “It’s a step-by-step progression,” he says. “You wouldn’t see it dwindling day by day.”Explore more on these topicsArcticGlaciersClimate crisisEndangered habitatsPolar regionsConservationWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

The research may also point toward other diseases potentially caused by Pfas that have not yet been identified, the authors said.The study is among the first to examine howPfaschemicals impact gene activity, called epigenetics.“This gives us a hint as to which genes and which Pfas might be important,” said Melissa Furlong, a University of Arizona College of PublicHealthPfas researcher and study lead author.Waste from agricultural plant poisoned US town’s water with Pfas, lawsuits allegeRead morePfas are a class of about15,000 compoundsmost frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environmentThe study checked the blood of about 300 firefighters from four departments across the country who were exposed to high levels of Pfas. The chemicals are the main ingredient in most firefighting foam, and are frequently used in “turnout gear” worn by firefighters because of their heat repelling propertiesFurlong said she was surprised to find the number of genes and biological pathways that were impacted by Pfas, which suggests the chemicals may cause or contribute to a broad range of health problems. The study did not prove the chemicals cause certain diseases, but findings point to biological changes that might precede disease.Genes play a range of roles in developing or preventing disease, and Pfas essentially change the way the genes are supposed to act, Furlong said. A gene may act as tumor suppressor, but the Pfas interferes with how it expresses, which affects whether cancer develops, or the type of cancer.For example, PFOS, among the most common and dangerous Pfas compounds, reduces levels of miR-128-1-5p, a gene tied to cancer development. Branched forms of PFOS were linked to changes in five other genes, including some that regulate cancer development.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDetox Your KitchenFree weekly newsletterA seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite the deadlock, they said they would carry on with a resumed session in the future.‘The ocean is spitting our rubbish back’: Italy’s museum of plastic pollutionRead moreSome NGOs called the failed talks a “blow to multilateralism”, and there was reflection among some delegates on how best to move forward: for instance, without the participation of petrostates that had obstructed the talks.Agnès Pannier-Runacher, France’s minister for ecological transition, said she was “disappointed” and “angry” that a handful of countries “guided by short-term financial interests” had bloked the adoption of an ambitious treaty.France, the EU and more than 100 countries, from every continent, “did everything possible” to obtain an agreement to reduce plastic production, to ban the most dangerous products and to protect human health, she said.Emma Hardy, the UK’s head of delegation and marine minister, said: “I’m hugely disappointed that an agreement wasn’t reached, but am extremely proud of the way the UK worked tirelessly until the end to seek an ambitious and effective treaty.”Colombia’s delegate, Sebastián Rodríguez, said: “The negotiations were consistently blocked by a small number of states who simply don’t want an agreement.”Tuvalu, speaking for 14 Pacific small island developing states, said: “For our islands this means that without global cooperation and state action, millions of tonnes of plastic waste will continue to be dumped in our oceans, affecting our ecosystem, food security, livelihood and culture.”China’s delegation said the fight against plastic pollution was a long marathon and the temporary setback represented a new starting point to forge consensus. It urged countries to work together to offer future generations a planet without plastic pollution.Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the chair of the negotiating committee, wrote and presented two drafts of treaty text based on the views expressed by the countries, but representatives from 184 countries rejected both as a basis for their negotiations.View image in fullscreenLuis Vayas Valdivieso chaired the negotiating committee that tried to get a treaty over the line.Photograph: Martial Trezzini/EPASaudi Arabia said both drafts lacked balance, and Saudi and Kuwaiti negotiators suggested the latest proposal, presented in the early hours of Friday, took other states’ views more into account. It addressed plastic production, which they considered to be outside the scope of the treaty.The Friday draft did not include a limit on plastic production but recognised that current production and consumption levels were “unsustainable” and global action was needed.There was little clarity on the way forward as delegates left the UN meeting on Friday morning. But there was acknowledgment that lessons needed to be learned and a new approach was needed.Jessika Roswall, the European commissioner for environment, said she saw the outcome of the talks as a good basis for a resumed session, but they must “be honest and learn from the process that has brought us here today”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Saudi Arabia said the drafts lacked balance.Photograph: Martial Trezzini/EPA“We need to consider how to approach this and whether to consider without [petrostates’] participation,” he said. “Many ambitious countries also have great hope in China, a country that not only has a much more diverse economy than some of its petrostate allies, but also has a demonstrated interest in showing leadership to solve global problems. This is the beginning of the beginning of the world’s attempt to address plastic pollution.”Christina Dixon, of the Environmental Investigation Agency, said the failure to reach a deal was a “blow to multilateralism”. If talks resume they needed a “new dynamic, a new chair and empowerment for delegates to utilise the right to vote … Its going to be really difficult to keep doing the same thing again and expect a different result – that’s the definition of insanity.”Melissa Sky, a senior lawyer at the Center for International Environmental Law, said:“If countries hope to ever achieve a treaty that meaningfully addresses plastics pollution, they will either need to vote at the INC [Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee] or take the negotiation elsewhere”Valdivieso said the session had merely been adjourned rather than ended. Countries and the secretariat “will be working to try to find a date and also a place” for resuming the talks, he told Agence France-Presse.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsSeascape: the state of our oceansUnited NationsPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

That includes many Republicans from districts whobenefited mostfrom the IRA’s green credits, and those who spent months attempting to defend renewable energy tax credits from the budget bill’s provisions, such as Representative Andrew Garbarino of New York and Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John Curtis of Utah.‘Shooting ourselves in the foot’: how Trump is fumbling geothermal energyRead moreThe new report from the environmental advocacy group Climate Power totalled up the funds the bill’s backers have accepted from the fossil fuel industry over the course of their political careers, finding that House members accepted $54.4m and senators accepted $51.5m.“These Republicans in Congress are caught red-handed taking massive donations from the oil and gas industry, and voting to give them billions and to destroy their competition from their own state’s clean energy industries,” the analysis says.With House midterm elections scheduled for next year, Climate Power also looked at fossil fuel donations to the 15 House Republicans deemed most vulnerable to an electoral challenge, according to the Cook Political Report, which independently analyzes the political viability of elections and campaigns. All 15 backed the mega-bill, and together, they accepted more than $3m in donations from the fossil fuel industry, the authors found.Hailing from Colorado, Iowa, Arizona, New Jersey, California, Michigan and New York, the lawmakers on the list are from regions that have seen benefits from the IRA’s credits for wind and solar energy, as well as battery manufacturing. The mega-bill puts more than 110,000 jobs from the three sectors at risk in the 15 lawmakers’ districts, and is also expected toraise consumers’ energy billsby up to $200 annually by 2030, according to the climate policy thinktankEnergy Innovation.Some on the list had previously critiqued the bill: Congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa, who has accepted $229,179 in oil and gas contributions, pledged to support clean energy tax credits but backed the legislation anyway, while Colorado’sJeff Hurd, pledged to oppose the bill due to its cuts to Medicaid but ended up supporting it.“These Republican members of Congress all represent moderate swing districts with close elections, where voters of both parties expect their representatives to look out for them, not to kill their jobs and raise their utility bills for the sake of out-of-state special interests,” said Pete Jones, a director at Climate Power. “These members chose who to stand up for, and they picked their billionaire donors.”Big oil spent a stunning $445m throughout the last election cycle to influenceTrumpand Congress, Climate Powerfound in January.The industry also poured more than $19m into Trump’s inaugural fund, accounting for nearly 8% of all donations it raised, areport found last month.“We will be a rich nation again, and it is thatliquid goldunder our feet that will help to do it,” Trump said in his inaugural address.Since re-entering the White House, Trump has passed not only the anti-environmental One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but has also signed a slew of executive orders and policies aimed at cracking down on clean energy and boosting already-booming oil and gas.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentDemocracy and justiceUS CongressUS politicsDonald TrumpJoe BidenTrump administrationFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

A Royal Navy veteran, Alfred Conway, from Lincolnshire, watched as his great granddaughter laid a wreath on the Burma railway memorial at the arboretum. George Durrant, who served in the intelligence corps, appeared on stage to urge people not to forget the sacrifices made by his comrades.In Japan, Emperor Naruhito spoke of his “deep remorse” on the anniversary and said he felt “a deep and renewed sense of sorrow” in a sombre speech in an indoor arena in the centre of the Japanese capital.VJ Day, Ukrainian PoWs and a field of sunflowers: photos of the day – FridayRead moreA visit by two cabinet ministers to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo angered countries that suffered Japanese military atrocities, particularly China and South Korea, AFP reported. The shrine, which the country’s Asian neighbours view as a symbol of Japan’s wartime aggression, honours 2.5 million mostly Japanese soldiers who perished since the late 19th century but also enshrines convicted war criminals.Japan’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, a political moderate, sent a customary offering to Yasukuni, according to Kyodo news. No Japanese prime minister has visited the shrine since 2013, when a trip by then-premier Shinzo Abe sparked fury in Beijing and Seoul.China’s foreign ministry on Friday summoned the chief minister of Japan’s embassy in China, Yokochi Akira, to lodge solemn representations over Japanese politicians visiting the war shrine, according to a ministry statement, Reuters reported.View image in fullscreenA Lancaster bomber flanked by a Hurricane and Spitfire form a Battle of Britain memorial flypast.Photograph: Alastair Grant/ReutersIn an audio message before the national service of remembrance to the nation, realms and Commonwealth, Charles spoke of allied prisoners of war “who endured years of brutal captivity: the starvation, disease and cruelty that tested the very limits of human endurance” and the “mental and physical scars” the war left on those who survived. He vowed the service and sacrifice of VJ Day heroes “shall never be forgotten”.In what is believed to be the most direct reference by a British monarch to the suffering in Hiroshima and Nagasaki after their atomic bombings, he said: “We should also pause to acknowledge that in the war’s final act, an immense price was paid by the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – a price we pray no nation need ever pay again.”More than 90,000 British troops were casualties in the war against Japan, and nearly 30,000 died according to the Royal British Legion, while more than 12,000 Britons were among the 190,000 Commonwealth troops held as prisoners of war by the Japanese.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer with a second world war veteran after the service.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesOf the Allied forces, the US suffered the greatest losses, with more than 100,000 killed in action. In Hiroshima and Nagasaki, more than 200,000 people were killed by the US bombs and in the months after succumbing to radiation sickness, the effects of burns and other serious injuries.Hundreds of buildings across the UK were due to be lit up on Friday evening to mark VJ Day 80, including Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street, the Houses of Parliament, the Tower of London, Tower 42, the Shard, Blackpool Tower, Gateshead Millennium Bridge, Durham Cathedral, Cardiff Castle, the Cenotaph and the White Cliffs of Dover.Explore more on these topicsSecond world warKing Charles IIIMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

The first redundancies will be made on Tuesday.The government’s decision creates uncertainty over a further 4,000 jobs in the industry’s supply chain including farmers and hauliers. Bioethanol is a petrol substitute produced from agricultural products.Vivergo opened a redundancy programme in June. At that point the government held talks with the company, more than a month afterABF warned that the US trade deal was an “existential threat”allowing US producers, for the first time, to compete litre-by-litre under a new duty free agreement for American ethanol.ABF and Ensus, the owner of the other major bioethanol plant in the UK, said the US deal would have a huge knock-on effect on wheat farmers who supplied their plants, as well as the UK’s lead in clean fuels.A spokesperson for ABF said on Friday: “It is deeply regrettable that the government has chosen not to support a key national asset. We have been left with no choice but to announce the closure of Vivergo and we have informed our people.“We have been fighting for months to keep this plant open. We initiated and led talks with government in good faith. We presented a clear plan to restore Vivergo to profitability within two years under policy levers already aligned with the government’s own green industrial strategy.”ABF had warned the US trade deal, hailed as a triumph for Starmer, was a killer blow because it scrapped tariffs on a quota of 1.4bn litres of imports from the US, the exact size of the UK production, as part of the agreement with Trump in May.The US trade deal was a victory for the car industry which had tariffs slashed from 27.5% to 10%. The steel industry is still facing 25% tariffs but the UK government is hoping these will be scrapped after further negotiation.Government sources said they had to prioritise the 320,000 jobs in auto, steel and aerospace and added that the ethanol plants had faced financial problems before the US deal.Sources in the National Farmers’ Union believe Trump’s negotiators had said that in exchange for slashing tariffs on cars and steel they wanted US farmers to have access to either the British pork or ethanol industries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Keny policethreatened her with arrestunder the Terrorism Act for holding a Palestinian flag and having signs saying “Free Gaza” and “Israel is committing genocide”.chartMurton filmed police telling her that even such general statements “all come under proscribed groups, which are terror groups that have been dictated by the government”.During the exchange, one officer said the phrase “Free Gaza” was “supportive of Palestine Action”, that it was illegal “to express an opinion or belief that is supportive of a proscribed organisation”, and that she had committed that offence with her signs.Falkner wrote: “Whilst we acknowledge police expertise in assessing security risks, we want to emphasise that any interference with protest rights must be lawful and assessed case by case.“Heavy-handed policing or blanket approaches risk creating a chilling effect, deterring citizens from exercising their fundamental rights to freedom of expression and assembly through fear of possible consequences.“This concern extends beyond those directly affected by police engagement to the broader health of our democracy, because the perception that peaceful protest may attract disproportionate police attention undermines confidence in our human rights protections.”Falkner urged ministers and police to make sure all officers were given “clear and consistent guidance on their human rights obligations in relation to protest”, which should “ensure that the appropriate balance is maintained between public safety and the protection of essential human rights”.Murton told the Guardian last week that her solicitorshad issued a letter of claimon her behalf to the chief constable of Kent police, in what was also said to be a move to remind other police forces of their responsibilities towards peaceful protests.Falkner said in a statement: “The right to peaceful protest is fundamental to our democracy and must be protected even when dealing with complex and sensitive issues.“We recognise the genuine challenges the police face in maintaining public safety, but we are concerned that some recent responses may not strike the right balance between security and fundamental rights.“Our role as the national human rights institution is to uphold the laws that safeguard everyone’s right to fairness, dignity and respect. When we see reports of people being questioned or prevented from peaceful protests that don’t support proscribed organisations, we have a duty to speak out.”The Liberal Democrats called on Cooper to act swiftly. Lisa Smart, the party’s home affairs spokesperson, said: “The lack of clarity that has been given to police officers has led to confusion, increasing tensions and risks creating a chilling effect on freedom of speech.“The home secretary needs to step in and give officers, often dealing with incredibly complex and sensitive situations, clear direction as to what is expected of them at protests.“Without that officers will be left exposed and those exercising their democratic rights worried about the consequences.”The warning comes in the context of wider police operations targeting protesters who, unlike Murton, appear to directly express support for Palestine Action, which is illegal given the group’s banned status.Membership of, or support for, the group is a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison under the Terrorism Act.The group was proscribed last month after incidents includingone in which four people were arrestedover damaged caused to two Voyager aircraft at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.In the latest of a series of mass protests against the decision, more than 500 peoplewere arrestedin London last Saturday, almost all for displaying placards or signs allegedly supportive of Palestine Action. Half of those arrested were aged 60 or above, according to police figures. On Friday night the Metropolitan poice said a further 60 people would be prosecuted for “showing support for the proscribed terrorist group Palestine Action”.Amnesty International UK said that while it welcomed the EHRC letter, the watchdog had “failed to acknowledge the hundreds of people unfairly arrested for peacefully exercising their right to free expression”.Sacha Deshmukh, the organisation’s chief executive, said: “This isn’t just about the chilling effect on freedom of speech for people ‘not linked to any proscribed organisation’, as the EHRC states, it’s also about the excessive policing of citizens’ right to protest against a decision made by their elected government.“Under international human rights law, protest speech should only be criminalised if it incites violence, hatred or discrimination. Holding a placard and peacefully stating opposition to a government decision to proscribe an organisation cannot realistically be treated as an example of incitement.”Downing Street has justified the ban on Palestine Action by saying it is “a violent organisation that has committed violence, significant injury, extensive criminal damage”, a description one of its co-foundershas saidis false and defamatory.The Home Office said the issues the EHRC had raised were an operational matter for the police. The Met referred the query to the Home Office.Explore more on these topicsProtestEquality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)Human rightsUK security and counter-terrorismPoliceYvette CoopernewsShareReuse this content"

I just wanted my life back, but he was still roaming freely, searching for me.”She added: “The world’s not set up for female victims and minorities to be listened to and believed. I think that’s a really hard thing to live with. That’s what’s so long-lasting about this trauma. It’s the shattered belief that if something bad happens, someone will protect me.”Keating subjected Saper to incessant messages in which he shared sexual fantasies, including that he would “go Fifty Shades of Grey” on her – a reference to the erotic bestseller – and wanted to abduct her.Jurors found Keating guilty of stalking after a trial at Portsmouth crown court, Hampshire, earlier this year. The court was told he went to Bali and visited bars and restaurants close to Saper’s home, messaging her to say: “You’re never getting rid of me.” When he returned to the UK, he was arrested and police found rope in his luggage.Saper’s complaints came after survivors of stalking, campaigners for women’s safety and heads of law enforcement raised concerns over continuing failings by police in England and Wales totackle perpetrators and protect victims.They said that while some forces were doing innovative work on stalking, others were not improving quickly enough, leading to a “patchwork” service and victims facing a “postcode lottery”.Last week, a 71-year-old man from Berkshire, Phil Appleton, wasordered not to contact the actor Anna Frielor go to the area where she lives after admitting to stalking her. He is to be sentenced next month.On Friday, Saper appeared in court after flying to the UK from Bali to give a statement to court as part of Keating’s sentencing.In the statement, she said: “In the two and a half years between when I first reported to the police and when they finally pressed charges, I have been forced to carry unreasonable burdens, navigate bureaucratic red tape and muster resilience in the face of persistent obstacles to justice.“My case was transferred between more than a dozen police officers and departments. Evidence was lost multiple times, or never passed on during transfers. Each time, it was like starting over.“Rob even harassed the female officers assigned to my case, one of whom was removed for her protection; but after that, my case sat unassigned for months, and my emails to the police were left ignored, while he continued to freely stalk me and terrorise me.“It was only after two and a half years of this hell, when he posted flights to return to Bali, photos and videos of me, and the words ‘Round Two’ that he was finally charged with stalking.”Speaking outside court, Saper said police officers in Indonesia and the UK “diminished” her case and she was subjected to “victim blaming”. She said UK police told her: “Well, just stop posting on Instagram.”She said: “There were so many times where we’d leave a report and then not hear anything, follow up and there was no record of the report.”Stalked: how a relentless campaign of online abuse derailed one woman’s lifeRead moreSaper said her case was transferred from a Sussex police force to Hampshire police at one point as Keating moved from one neighbouring county to the other. It led to another delay, she said. “That was horrific. That was outrageous.”DI Katt Green, from Hampshire and Isle of Wight constabulary, said: “It’s important to remember that our inquiries involved liaising with other forces and the logistics of engaging and supporting a victim who was abroad.“There was also a prolonged period during 2024 when all parties involved were outside of the UK, which limited the inquiries that could be undertaken during this time.”Sussex police have also been approached for comment. Keating will be sentenced on 9 October.In the UK, theNational Stalking Helplineis on 0808 802 0300 or email via theirinquiry form.

It is expected to become a major hurricane by Sunday morning.The National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miamireported on Xthat Erin, the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, was several hundred miles east of the northern Leeward Islands, with maximum sustained winds of 70mph.It had been expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Friday early afternoon but reached the designation a little earlier, as it approached the north-eastCaribbean, prompting forecasters to warn of possible flooding and landslides, and strengthen into a major category 3 storm late this weekend.The NHC has warned of the storm strengthening into a category 3 hurricane, bringing possible flooding and landslides.Private sector forecaster AccuWeather went further. “Erin is forecast to explode into a powerful category 4 hurricane as it moves across very warm waters in the open Atlantic. Water temperatures at the surface and hundreds of feet deep are several degrees higher than the historical average,” said Alex DaSilva, AccuWeather’s lead hurricane expert.Weather tracker: Typhoon Podul pounds southern TaiwanRead moreStorm watches were issued for Anguilla and Barbuda, St Martin and St Barts, Saba and St Eustatius and St Maarten, with torrential rain forecast to start late Friday in Antigua and Barbuda, the US and BritishVirgin Islands, and the southern and eastern parts of the US territory of Puerto Rico, east of the Dominican Republic and Haiti.Up to 4in (10cm) of rain are expected in the region, with isolated totals of up to 6in, according to the NHC. Forecasters have also warned of dangerous swells.“There is still uncertainty about what impacts Erin may bring to portions of the Bahamas, the east coast of the United States, and Bermuda in the long range,” NHC said on Friday.Hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry said to the Associated Press that Erin is forecast to eventually take a sharp turn north-east that would put it on a path between the US and Bermuda.“The forecasts for next week still keep the future hurricane safely east of the mainland US,” he said.Erin formed from a cluster of showers and thunderstorms that moved off the African coast last week, becoming a tropical rainstorm near the Cabo Verde Islands and dumping up to 8in of rain in five hours. Televisão África reported that at least six people died, with more missing, after flash flooding.AccuWeather predicted Erin would create dangerous surf and rip currents up the US east coast next week, with waves reaching up to 15ft in North Carolina.Explore more on these topicsUS weatherHurricanesNatural disastersFloridaPuerto RicoVirgin IslandsCaribbeannewsShareReuse this content"

Haddadi said the AU endorsed the campaign, adding it aligned with its goal of “reclaiming Africa’s rightful place on the global stage” amid growing calls for reparations for colonialism and slavery.The AU will advocate for wider map adoption and discuss collective actions with member states, Haddadi added.The Mercator projection is still widely used, including by schools and tech companies.

Police at the time initially refused to consider the murder a hate crime, and tens of thousands of people protested to demand justice.View image in fullscreenPeople march in tribute to Ilan Halimi in February 2006.Photograph: Pascal Pavani/AFP/Getty ImagesThe president of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, Yonathan Arfi, said on Friday that the felling of the tree was extremely painful. “There is nothing more cowardly, and those who have murdered his memory are no better than those who took his life 20 years ago,” he said. “This is not just another antisemitic act, it is a way for antisemites to shout that they are here more than ever.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Held prisoner for ransom, he was tortured for 24 days before he was found naked, bound and gagged on 13 February 2006.Youssouf Fofana, the head of the gang called the Barbarians, was sentenced to life in prison for Halimi’s murder.

But And Just Like That insulted their intelligence, obscured them with poorly written newbies, left them with far too little to do – and now they’re goneRebecca NicholsonFri 15 Aug 2025 09.56 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 14.52 EDTShareAfter 27 years, some of TV’s most beloved characters have left our screens for ever. Throughout Sex and the City, Carrie Bradshaw chronicled her loves, infatuations, affairs, heartbreaks, friendships, high fashion, homes, work and more, all over a cosmopolitan or five. Throughout what would turn out to be the final season of its spin-off,And Just Like That, she finally ended her extremely on/off 20-year-relationship with country boy Aidan, a man revived for the series with a cruel streak and all the subtlety of Elmer Fudd, and slowly bought furniture for her enormous mansion.In many ways, the entire series was an inglorious swansong. And Just Like That first appeared in 2021, and devotees of the original might have held a tentative flicker of hope that in returning to these beloved characters, now in their 50s, it might find a way to repurpose some of its former magic for this new stage of life. It began with a splash by killing off Carrie’s husband, Mr Big, who had a heart attack while overdoing it on his stationary exercise bike.Some felt that such a casual death was disrespectful to the show’s history – something that would become a running theme – but it did, at least, suggest that the show was not going to hold back, or tiptoe around its past and legacy.View image in fullscreenSex and the City original Charlotte was joined by new characters such as Lisa for the spin-off series.Photograph: HBOUnfortunately, it went in the other direction, careering all over that legacy like a toddler just learning to walk. There would be no Samantha, of course:Kim Cattrall, who played her, has long been open about her poor relationship with her former cast mates and her lack of interest in returning to the show.And Just Like That tried to plug the Samantha gap with new friends, finding Samantha’s ambition in a documentary-maker, Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker), and her sex drive in real estate agent Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury), though both mostly felt like superfluous distractions from the core characters.Cattrall did return as Samantha for 71 seconds, during the season two finale, but only to phone Sarah Jessica Parker’s Carrie to let her know that she wouldn’t make it to the party, after all. The scene was delicious, camp and regal, but a stark reminder of how much the character was missed.From its earliest days, And Just Like That became synonymous with hate-watching. This reached its peak with Miranda’s divorce from Steve and affair with Che Diaz, a non-binary standup comedian, who turned into one of the internet’sfavourite least-favourite characters. Che was poorly written, sure, but they were indicative of the show’s haphazard handling of ageing. It largely examined getting older by placing characters in a state of bewilderment at how much the world had changed since the early 00s, which felt shallow and unflattering to their intelligence. They would be confused by podcasts, or restaurants with digital menus. The wit and acidic humour of Sex and the City allowed it to ask big questions, not all of which have aged well, but in And Just Like That, there was simply an admission that nobody really knew what was going on any more.View image in fullscreenGoodbye Carrie: the character in And Just Like That’s finale.Photograph: HBOAll of its worst tendencies came out inthe finale. Oddly, it mostly ended up being about Charlotte’s friend Mark, Brady, the mother of Brady’s unborn child and her confusingly obnoxious young genderqueer friends (let it go!). It was a shrug of a plotline that washed its hands of everything that made the characters what they once were, by deciding not to make it about the characters at all.Through much of the last season, there was a sense that Carrie has nothing to do but wander around in couture, aimlessly, too rich to have any ambitions left, other than a now vague notion of romantic love. It is not a tragedy that she waved farewell to the land ofSex and the Cityas a single woman, but it is not as poignant as the writers seem to believe it is, either. It’s nothing-ey, an ambient inbetween, a very And Just Like That-esque, “will this do?”. After a particularly hideous blocked-toilet episode, Carrie said the punchline that the whole scene was written to deliver: “Shit happens.” It was a muted note on which to bow out.They knew the end was coming, that much is clear. At the start of August, in the statement announcing that it would be ending for good, showrunner Michael Patrick King said that when writing the last episode, “it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop”.Wonderful might have been pushing it. It has been a curious four years, full of superfluous nonsense, not unpleasant, but not a patch on its TV ancestor. That blocked toilet, overflowing, was doing some heavy lifting when it came to the metaphor. It is hard to argue that And Just Like That should have gone on, when it became so evident that it had nowhere to go.Explore more on these topicsAnd Just Like ThatTelevisionSex and the CitySarah Jessica ParkerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A hot comb sizzling fresh from the stove, the gentle whirring of a sewing machine. A group of women cross-legged on the floor, swapping clothes and gossip: who got turned away at the club door last weekend? Who might show up tonight?For the London-based archivist Deborah Carnegie, there is something atavistic and sacred about the pre-night out ritual, in particular for Black British women. It is the subject of her latest work, a photography archive spanning 1950 to the present day, chronicling Black British women’s Saturday night fashion across the decades.Presented for the first time at this summer’s London College of Fashion’s Fashioning Frequencies exhibition, Carnegie’s collection is the result of months spent gathering images from family photo albums, nightclub photographers’ archives and submissions from friends. (The show has now closed; Carnegie is looking for a new venue to show her photos.)We’re meeting for lunch at Jumbi, one of south-east London’s extant African-Caribbean bars (and a spot I have spent many an evening in, in my Saturday night best; at night it is transformed into a sea of swaying bodies and rum punches under ambient red lights.). “I used to go out round here all the time back in my day,” Carnegie says over plantain and jerk rice. “It’s nice that places like this still exist.“For so long our style has been disparaged as ‘ghetto’,” she says. In the 90s, Carnegie studied fashion as an undergraduate in Surrey. “My teachers at college used to ask me: ‘Who’s going to wear this?’ And I would think: ‘I’ve already got clients!’”Carnegie’s work is a paean to a community whose influence on the country’s fashion she feels has gone underacknowledged. But the subject is personal as well as academic. Growing up in the 60s, she lived with her great-aunt, who ran a nightclub in the cellar of their south London flat.“I’d be in the living room and see guests going downstairs in their fur coats – hair done, jewellery on – and the men in their pinstripe suits and trilby hats,” she says. “My auntie’s rule was that you had to get dressed up if you wanted to go downstairs.”Her great-aunt came to the UK from Jamaica as part of the Windrush generation, and was one of the Britons who helped lay the foundations of a Black British aesthetic. Combining fabrics inspired by Africa, the Caribbean and the UK, there was noticeably more colour in their palettes, compared with the pallid austerity of postwar Britain. At the time, it was seen as outre.The Thurrock Gazette reported in 1948:“Dressed in an odd assortment of clothes, many wearing ties of dazzling designs, over 450 Jamaicans arrived at Tilbury Docks on the Empire Windrush.”“Colour wasn’t as popular in the UK, so we used to make our own outfits out of materials for tablecloths: the greens, blues, oranges,” Carnegie says; they were “inspired by the front rooms in the Caribbean”. Money was an issue but no obstacle to style. “Back in the day, we just made our clothes ourselves,” she says. “We were poor, and most of the dresses didn’t fit our bodies anyway – we had big tits and big bums – so clothes here just didn’t fit us right.”There is a warm familiarity in the images. We may not be hot-combing our hair and reupholstering tablecloths any more, but there is still a thread of continuity running through the 70 years of nightlife documented in Carnegie’s archive, whether it’s getting ready to step on to the linoleum of a 1950s blues night, or a 2000s Afrobeats weekender.“Hair is still a focal point,” she says, “and dressing head-to-toe: the lashes, the nails, too.” Black British women remain, according to Carnegie, tastemakers when it comes to fashion. You only need to look at the pervasiveness of trainer culture, oversized hoops or the slick-back bun in recent years to see her point.“That has always been the way,” she says. “When I was growing up, I never saw Black women on the runway or in magazines. But we’ve always been at the forefront. When we weren’t allowed in those spaces, we made Saturday night our catwalk.”Saturday night life: images from the collectionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Deborah CarnegieA photo of Carnegie’s great-aunt on her wedding day in 1956, this portrait resists tradition. Instead of a white dress, she wore a bespoke suit tailored by her dressmaker, its neat buttons lending elegance and definition, her hair pressed with a hot iron. “She didn’t want a traditional white wedding,” says Carnegie. “The buttons really make the suit and define the look.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Bouzidi gives us the time-honoured scenario of a smalltown movie theatre’s last day before closing down, resonantly named the Royal Alamo and showing for its last stand a couple of films on 35mm. The place has been stricken, of course, by the prevalence of digital streaming, although the wistful mood doesn’t seem too different from Bogdanovich’s The Last Picture Show from 1971, when Netflix wasn’t a problem.The Royal Alamo is now a bittersweet place of memories whose spirit is perhaps epitomised by the two guys listlessly working at the concessions stand, and bickering amusingly like Kevin Smith’s Clerks. (“That movie where Johnny Depp played the creepy paedophile … ”, “Willy Wonka?”, “Yeah”) The title might imply that some concessions are metaphorical. Perhaps doing a dull job is a concession made in return for privileged access to the dream factory.One is Hunter (Rob Riordan), who can’t believe he’s been wasting his life working here since high school and at one moment has the humiliation of having to serve a guy in his class who is now a big deal. Hunter does not, in fact, watch the movies showing at the Royal Alamo, although his final moments are not, in fact, too dissimilar from those of Olivia Colman in Sam Mendes’s sadness-of-cinema filmEmpire of Light. The other concessions guy is Lorenzo (Jonathan Lorenzo Price) who has a football scholarship at Tampa, Florida and so unlike all these other losers, he has a ticket out of this no-hope small town, but confides his own anxieties to Deana (Lana Rockwell) who sells tickets. The place is managed by grumpy Luke (Steven Ogg) whose dad built the place in the early 1970s.Madsen has a cameo playing Fuel, who resembles a character deleted from Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: a cheerful, bleary guy who wanders in and asks Deana – whom he calls “Toots” – for a free ticket to the movie they’re showing because he did the stunts on it; he cordially sidles up to a woman in the auditorium and presents her with his card, in case she should need a stuntman. This good-natured appearance redoubles the film’s cinephile tristesse and its ancestor-worship, although maybe this rather familiar subject needs an injection of new ideas that Concessions, however amiable, does not really provide.Concessions screened at theEdinburgh film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmMichael MadsenDrama filmsEdinburgh film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

I have in the pastwondered aloudif Kötting might tackle the challenges of being with Eden more straightforwardly. But perhaps that was obtuse of me; it could be that it is only this complex, layered, tonally elusive approach which refuses the conventional grammar of clinical concern does justice to the idea of seeing the world as Eden sees it.The film has Eden dressed in a blue gingham pinafore dress of the kind associated with Alice in Wonderland (and therefore, perhaps, associating her with the idea of a journey or pilgrimage which is often a trope in Kötting’s films). She is in a group alongside other adults with learning-development issues and on the shop floor of a factory where they are pretending that they are producing “memory blocks” with machine tools and 3D printers: hollowed-out metal blocks which are the containers or constituent elements of memory. They participate in the fiction that these blocks will stimulate consciousness and send them back in time to happy memories; 3D animated images of nuts and bolts float across the screen.They are a happy supportive group with a genial relationship with Kötting, whose voice can be heard off-camera. At one point he asks them where they would like to travel; one woman says Prague, Eden says France (a place of happy memories) and another man says Locarno in Switzerland, because he likesVon Kleist’s ghost storyThe Beggar Woman of Locarno. Eden is also shown walking in huge landscapes, alone with her walking frame, or with her friends, or with others in fancy dress and costumes.These unselfconscious performances or enactments might be bringing us close to an understanding of what Eden thinks and feels – but maybe that isn’t the point and perhaps Eden, or those close to her, have no great need for this kind of insight and the object is more a kind of quietist harmony. Either way, the calmly purposeful originality of Kötting’s work is valuable.The Memory Blocks screened at theEdinburgh film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsEdinburgh film festivalFestivalsLearning disabilityDisabilityNeurodiversityreviewsShareReuse this content"

That summer, the Russian government hadcracked downon the remaining independent media in the country, designating outlets and journalists it found irksome as “foreign agents”. Loktev, who moved to the US from the Soviet Union at age nine, had several journalist friends now required to submit detailed financial reports to the government and affix an all-caps disclaimer to any output, be it an article or an Instagram post of their cat, declaring it the work of a foreign agent.‘Death always feels imminent’: a moving Netflix documentary on prison, music and forgivenessRead moreLoktev began shadowing her friend Anna Nemzer, a host on the country’s only remaining independent news channel, TV Rain (Dozhd, in Russian), which was on the growing list of “foreign agents” meant to chill any press critical of Vladimir Putin’s regime. She was particularly interested in Sonya Groysman and Olga Churakova, two female journalists in their 20s who, with youthful gusto, started the podcastHi, You’re a Foreign Agentto document how their new notoriety affected their lives. “I thought I was making a film about these young journalists who were dealing with this. I thought it was going to be called The Lives of Foreign Agents,” Loktev recalled recently. “I thought I was making a film about people trying to figure out how you live in a country where you oppose the government. How long can you keep working? How do you keep fighting when you live under a regime you oppose?”Instead, Loktev’s film, My Undesirable Friends: Part One – Last Air in Moscow, became a record of Russian independent media’s last gasps under Putin, a time capsule of a world that no longer exists. Loktev tells us so in the opening minutes of this astonishing five-hour film (now playing in theaters, with a break between chapters 1-3 and 4-5): “The world you are about to see no longer exists,” she says over footage of bright storefronts in Moscow. “None of us knew what was about to happen.” In February 2022, four months after Loktev started filming, Russia launched a full-scale invasion ofUkraine, a shock even to the clear-eyed journalists who had reported on Putin’s mobilization of troops in the days and weeks prior. Within a week, much of the country’s civil society and independent pressfled. The first chapter of My Undesirable Friends, filmed in October 2021, ends with a chilling note: every person you just saw now lives in exile.Much of My Undesirable Friends thus plays out like a thriller, with characters trying to figure out their next move with what we know to be limited time. On some level, they know it, too, even if they do not yet believe it. “A year from now, we’ll remember October 2021 as Eden,” Groysman tells Loktev in the first chapter. “In a year, half your characters won’t be inRussia, and someone will certainly end up in jail.” Most of the independent journalists Loktev followed are young women just old enough to remember a time when Russian society was freer, and are loth to let it go without a fight. At one point, Groysman shows the camera a bunch of magazines that she kept from 2012, her senior year of high school, that support LGBTQ+ rights or bolster the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny or encourage dissent, all unimaginable a decade later.Groysman and Churakova form part of a tight core of journalists, across a handful of remaining outlets, who anchor the film with disarming warmth and humor; in one scene, as Loktev films Groysman folding laundry at her unsettled Moscow apartment, the latter jokingly chastises: “An American journalist is digging through Russian dirty laundry!” The two podcast hosts overlap with Ksenia Mironova, a fellow journalist whose fiance, Ivan Safronov, was indefinitely jailed on trumped-up charges after he investigated Russian defense contracts. (Safronov wassentencedto 22 years in prison in September 2022, a sham verdict meant tothreaten journalists.) Mironova calmly recounts how the authorities upended their apartment in the raid that took Safronov away – a terrifying possibility within a dark range of common intimidation tactics. “Some of our characters have been searched, some of their places were bugged,” said Loktev. “They were constantly afraid of when they would have to leave, or when they would have to stop working or worse, when they would be arrested.”Nevertheless, they keep working. Mironova keeps reporting, even as she breaks when sending care packages to Safronov that will almost certainly never reach him. So do Irina Dolinina and Alesya Marokhovskaya, even after their studio is bugged and they lose their rare trial contesting the foreign agents label. So does Elena Kostyuchenko, an exceptionally daring reporter for the storied investigative outlet Novaya Gazeta, even after several of her colleagues have been killed; at the outset of the invasion, she manages to slip into Ukraine. So does Nemzer, the host of a short-lived TV Rain program called Who’s Got the Power? on civil society leaders, even as the noose tightens on free speech in the country. Just before going on air with her university thesis adviser to talk about the detention of her parents’ friend, an academic also designated a “foreign agent”, Nemzer reflects on the surreality of the collapse in real time: “It’s this constant attempt, on one hand, not to panic or become hysterical – everything is OK, everything is OK. On the other hand, you can’t allow yourself to get used to this.”Again and again, each journalist tries to articulate the strange cognitive dissonance of life going on as the society you knew crumbles. There are several scenes of warm camaraderie – birthday parties, group dinners, New Year’s wishes for a better year in 2022 that now feel haunted. Frank conversation of daunting opposition and unbelievable risks are mixed with references to Harry Potter – Putin makes an easy comparison to Voldemort – and Instagram trends. What is an acute crisis to independent journalists seems minor to many other Russians – Michelin-star restaurants open in Moscow, cafes are full. Several have relatives who are not as critical of the regime; Marokhovskaya must hide her girlfriend from her conservative family. As a sociologist tells Groysman: “This feeling that we’re in a state of war, and everyone around us is not, is typical for totalitarian regimes.”It is hard, as an American writer, not to see reflections in the current US administration, which has made moves strikingly, chillingly similar to Putin. “When I was making this, it felt like something that happens over there,” said Loktev. “And just in the last six months, it’s startling how many things in the film are being echoed here.” Journalistskicked outof the presidential press pool in favor of uncritical sycophants. Universitiescowedandsanctioned. Thefiring of the Bureau of Labor Statistics chiefover unflattering data, theerasure of Trump’s impeachmentsfrom the Smithsonian, thepurging of the Kennedy Center board– all mirror actions taken by the Putin regime.View image in fullscreenKsenia Mironova.Photograph: Julia Loktev“We’re experiencing something we have not experienced before, and we don’t know how to deal with it,” said Loktev of the US. “We go outside, there’s nice cafes, life looks normal. And meanwhile, men in hooded masks are snatching people into unmarked vans.” The dissonance coursing through Loktev’s film – so much calm, amid so much catastrophe – is “how life looks when this happens. Thatishow life looks under an authoritarian regime. It’s just not how we imagine it.”For Loktev’s subjects, life and work are inextricable; both cratered abruptly after the stateshut downTV Rain and other outlets, threatening criminal penalties. As captured in the final chapter, most fled that night, hopping on the next available flight – to Istanbul, to Tbilisi, to Mongolia – with whatever they could pack in two hours. Loktev stayed one extra day, to make sure her footage uploaded to the cloud, in case her drives were confiscated. She is at work on Part Two, titled Exile, which picks up two days after the mass exodus, as her subjects continue to work from the US and Europe, trying to report honestly on Russia for Russian audiences.In the third chapter, in late December 2021, Nemzer acknowledges how futile that task could be, even before the disastrous invasion. In a commemorative year-end video for TV Rain, she recalls a year spent asking human rights activists why they keep working when they’re persecuted; asking lawyers why they keep going to court when it’s rigged; asking journalists why they keep investigating when exposure changes nothing. The answer, always, was to create a record of truth. “Sometimes I ask myself, ‘God, what am I doing?’” she says. “I have one answer. If all these people are creating a record, then I’m going to try too.”My Undesirable Friends stands as its own staggering record, of people “who kept fighting despite the odds, who were continuing to speak the truth”, said Loktev. “They kept doing this even as they were named foreign agents, even as they risked arrest. They just kept doing it.”My Undesirable Friends will show at Film Forum in New York City from 15 August with a UK date to be announcedThis article was amended on 15 August 2025. A previous version erroneously stated that Ivan Safronov was sentenced to 24 years in prison. He was sentenced to 22 years.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Contestants who have abuse screamed in their face. Cash prizes. This documentary about a horrific 00s weight-loss reality TV series in the US makes for deeply troubling watchingPhil HarrisonFri 15 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 08.49 EDTShareThe mid-2000s were a peculiar time in television. After the dubious 90s innovations of Jerry Springer in the US were followed by the UK launch of Big Brother, it was clear that using the travails of so-called ordinary people as fuel for small-screen entertainment was an idea with legs. There was a mini goldrush of sorts as programme makers realised that conflict, extremity and dysfunction would always sell – and that any human-interest subject could be shoehorned into some version of reality TV.In Britain, ITV’s The Jeremy Kyle Show began casting its malign spell in 2005. In the US, something similarly queasy (and enduring) had arrived a year earlier in the shape of NBC’s weight loss bootcamp-meets-bearpit, The Biggest Loser, which took contestants living with obesity then belittled them with humiliating tasks such as moving food from one place to another using only their teeth. It deployed fitness coaches to scream abuse in their faces, and weighed them in front of a studio audience. For the series winner, there was, in addition to a newly slimline body, a large cash prize.The first former contestant we meet in this three-part documentary about the show is season eight winner Danny Cahill. Danny does not look like someone who has lost large amounts of weight. This is an intimation of trouble ahead. Could it be that losing weight over a recklessly short period of time is not a sustainable way of combating obesity? Might it even be dangerous? Quite possibly. We’re told that a high percentage of former contestants who later took part in a New York Times study put much of their weight back on after the show. And the study suggested the programme’s hothouse methods caused people’s metabolisms to slow, making them less able to process food quickly.How about aftercare? The Biggest Loser simply didn’t bother with it, as the producers openly admit. In the context of the stories in Fit for TV, that feels unforgivable. For season one winner Ryan Benson, weight loss quickly became a means to an end. “I lost all focus on getting healthy,” he says. “It was about winning.” Shortly after the final episode, blood was found in his urine. It was around that time that he was congratulated (after a fashion) by one of the show’s two fitness trainers, the permanently snarling Jillian Michaels. “Ryan, you just made me a millionaire,” she apparently said.Michaels declined to be interviewed for this series, which is a shame from a journalistic point of view but a relief in every other way. The show’s other gym beast, Bob Harper, does front up. He is fairly forthright in his defence of the show, claiming that many people were helped – although his habit of lifting his small dog on to his lap when difficult subjects arise feels revealing. He also manages, in four throwaway words, to make a watertight case against the show. “Everyone knows it’s diet,” he says, when discussing sustainable weight loss strategies. What offhand disdain for viewers and participants is contained in that short sentence. Everyone here is being taken for a mug. Because when it comes to the creation of TV, what use is a diet? Watching peoplenoteating doughnuts and burgers is no fun. Can’t we push them until they vomit instead?Chainsaws, shame and lifelong damage: inside TV’s horrific relationship with plus-size peopleRead moreThe author and podcaster Aubrey Gordon, who has written and spoken extensively about weight-related issues, pinpoints the crucial problem.The Biggest Loser wanted to have its calorific cake and eat it. It encouraged participants to trust the process and then misled them at every turn. “The show was trying to do deep emotional work,” she says. “But it didn’t want to have people who were credentialed to do it.” And so, she suggests that the trainers became pseudo-therapists as well as drill sergeants. They were both carrot and stick. Ultimately, the documentary claims that they simply couldn’t be trusted, as evinced in their giving contestants caffeine pills to stimulate energy and suppress appetite, even as the programme’s resident medic was telling them not to drink coffee.Perhaps fittingly, this documentary feels somewhat frantic in places – it’s as jittery and frenetic as a caffeine-fuelled workout. It would probably have benefited from fewer voices, a little more analysis and a clearer narrative through-line. However, the stories it tells are powerful enough to stick in the memory, as warnings from recent history. As the age of truly nasty reality TV passes (for now), documentaries about these kinds of shows are starting to feel like their own microgenre, with their own tropes. As with earlier series about Jerry Springer (on Netflix) and Jeremy Kyle (on Channel 4), there is a limited, grudging mea culpa or two. There is also plenty of buck-passing. There are obvious villains and equally obvious victims. And somewhere at the back of it all is a sense that, even at this point, it’s all in the game. For now, TV’s appetite for extremity has taken a back seat to its willingness to acknowledge duty of care. This may not always be the case.Fit for TV: The Reality of the Biggest Loser is on Netflix.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewReality TVDocumentaryObesityFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Hull …” Chiedu Oraka grins, pointing his mic towards the middle of a near-empty recording studio. Silence – for now, at least. Next week, that pause will be filled by 20,000 voices at Craven Park stadium, where the local rapper will openColdplay’s latest UK run of Music of the Spheres tour dates. And he is determined to make that crowd his own. “There’s going to be people there who haven’t seen me before, so I want to give them everything – new songs, old ones and a party,” he says. “I’m proper buzzing for it.”Last year, Oraka played Glastonbury, opened for Skepta at South by Southwest and supported the Brit-award-winning rapper Casisdead. But theseColdplayshows are the 37-year-old’s biggest gigs yet – and Hull’s most high-profile music events in years. The gigs reflect Coldplay’s effort to reach working-class areas, while 10% of the proceeds from ticket sales will go to the Music Venue Trust, which protects grassroots venues. Chris Martin enlisting Oraka fulfils part of that ethos to uplift communities.View image in fullscreen‘Proper buzzing’ … Chiedu Oraka performing at the Nordoff and Robbins Northern Music awards in Liverpool this year.Photograph: Richard Martin-Roberts/Getty Images“Chris FaceTimed me from his studio in LA and said: ‘I’m coming to your city. How can I help you?’” says Oraka. We are speaking at Yankee Land, aHullfast food spot renowned for its chips. Oraka is a family friend who has been anointed with his own box meal: a giant burger with turkey bacon, fries, chilli cheese bites and popcorn chicken. Today, however, he has opted for a chicken burger, strips and a chocolate milkshake.“I was just brazen with it,” he continues. “Like: ‘Mate, I wanna support you on both shows.’” They announced the newson social mediawith a staged video call, in which Martin repeatedly butchered the pronunciation of Chiedu, before conceding that Coldplay would be, Oraka says, “closing the show for me”. The line was Martin’s idea; the mispronunciation gag came from earlier conversations, when the frontman struggled with his name.Over email, Martin keeps up the shtick: “I discovered Chiedu while learning about the music scene in Hull, and after we spoke a bit I asked him if he’d be open to us closing for him there. He took his time, but eventually agreed, as long as we don’t look him in the eye.”In Yankee Land, at least, the 6ft 7in (2-metre) star wears his homegrown celebrity status with warm humility. Staff repeatedly offer to replenish our spread of food. “Hey, Chie!” is followed by promises to text meet-up plans. “Everyone’s my best mate now,” he laughs, recalling the frenzy that followed the Coldplay news. “Like: ‘Oh, Iknewhe was always going to do it!’”Oraka was born and raised by a single mother on a council estate in north Hull and his identity is at the core of his artistry. They were the only Black family in the area; he grew up surrounded by white classmates who didn’t understand his Nigerian heritage. Racism was so entrenched that some of his friends hid from their parents the fact they were hanging out with a Black kid.‘A funny accent draws bare attention’: how regional rappers stormed the chartsRead more“We were eating pounded yam and when my friends came over they were weirded out by it,” he says. “I was embarrassed. I just wanted to fit in.” He soon started getting into trouble. By 10, he was arrested for shoplifting; in 2007, he went to prison for fighting. “I’ve gone through the system of crime, I’ve sold drugs – the stereotypical ‘Black thing’ to do.” Now, through music, Oraka wants to tell a different story.Sonically, the rapper is indebted to London, switching with ease between grime, garage and UK funky. But on his debut mixtape, 2024’s Misfit, Oraka raps about mental health and race through the lens of a working-class northerner. On Own Kind, he is candid about feeling like an outsider in mainstream Black spaces: “At home, I’m way too Black / When I leave it’s not the same.” On No Need, he voices his mum’s fear of him ending up like Christopher Alder, a Black man whodied in police custody in Hull in 1998. “I’m trying to northernise the Black experience, because it’s more than just inner-city London,” he says.Oraka says he has encountered hostility in the London-centric music industry, from comments about his accent to a lack of interest from Black music outlets. “I really wanted to be accepted in the GRM Daily, Link Up TV, Mixtape Madness world – you know, the main Black media. And I just wasn’t getting no love,” he says. “When a Black guy raps about drugs and jail, it unfortunately sells, because that’s the language people understand. But there are stories to be told from kids who grew up like me. I just want a level playing field.”Oraka has since learned to embrace his difference as a “superpower” – hence his slogan “The Black Yorkshireman”, which today is emblazoned on the back of his T-shirt. A new EP, Undeniable, will drop in October, accompanied by a UK tour that kicks off at the New Adelphi Club in Hull, a tiny venue that has hosted Oasis and fellow local success story the Housemartins.View image in fullscreenBehind the scenes … Oraka and the producer and hype man Deezkid in rehearsal.Photograph: James WhincupHis new music, he says, is “going to show the listener that I mean business. I’m coming for the title of king of the north.” He catches himself to avoid disrespecting the incumbent royal. “I’m not trying to slate Bugzy Malone – I think he’s unreal. What he’s done for northern rappers is mad. He created the blueprint.”Diversity in Hull has improved significantly since Oraka’s childhood. But afterlast summer’s riotsand the election of a Reform mayor in East Yorkshire this spring, Oraka acknowledges that there is still work to be done. “That was embarrassing,” he says, of last year’s violence. “That’s not a true reflection of Hull at all. It’s just a very small minority. The recent election was terrible – unfortunately, a lot of these people are sheep. They don’t do their own research and follow the bandwagon. It’s very toxic.”The weight of this moment is not lost on Oraka and he is prepared for the pressure that comes with increased visibility. “This is an opportunity for young Black kids from Hull to see me supporting the biggest band in the world. Like: if he can do it, there’s hope for us,” he says, beaming. “I feel that responsibility and I’m relishing it. I was born to do this.”Undeniable is released via Republic of Music on 31 October.

But celebrity is always relative – and, for better or worse, most Proms artists don’t also headline stadium gigs.But Japanese composer and conductorJoe Hisaishi doesand, at 74, is a Proms debut artist like no other. He came on stage to waves of screaming and phones brandished to capture the moment. Never heard of him? You’re probably not part of the vast fanbase of the“cultural phenomenon” Studio Ghibli. Hisaishi is the John Williams of anime, responsible for the music in global hits fromMy Neighbour TotorotoThe Boy and the Heron.The European premiere of Hisaishi’s symphonic suite from the latter opened this Prom, with the composer switching between his own soulful piano part and conducting theRoyal Philharmonic Orchestra. Quacking produced by brass mouthpieces provoked giggles and the orchestra luxuriated in the expansive majesty of Hisaishi’s scoring. But this remained a short concert recap of one of Hisaishi’s blandest film scores.View image in fullscreenDouble duty … Hisaishi and countertenor John Holiday.Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCHisaishi’s suite The End of the World (another European premiere) was more ambitious. There were hints of Stravinsky, strictly atonal lyricism and big band jazz alongside symphonic landscaping that marshalled the RPO,BBC SingersandPhilharmonia Chorusinto sweeping waves of sound, all colourful post-minimalism topped by frothing strings. CountertenorJohn Holidaydid double duty with a starkly beautiful solo in the central movement and a final, crooning rendition of Skeeter Davis’s 1960s pop numberThe End of the World, stratospheric violins providing eerie “wrong” notes that soured an otherwise saccharine texture.In a flash of inspired programming,Steve Reich’s The Desert Music followed, led with tireless concentration by Hisaishi. This is epic minimalism, demanding immense stamina from the performers to sustain Reich’s vibrantly pulsing texture for 50 minutes. Two percussionists were allocated page turners, such is the score’s relentlessness. The BBC Singers andNational Youth Voices– lightly amplified, as Reich demands – produced a remarkable, studio-mixed choral blend, while the RPO’s labour-intensive loops and licks were intricately moreish, the slow-spun fabric utterly hypnotic.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

Chia focuses on piano on tracks such as Pandan, poignant ambient jazz in the style of Matthew Bourne or Ryuichi Sakamoto; Blue, a study in thick, aqueous reverb; and Do U Forget a Feeling?, with more reverb set against a crisp beat, as if tapped out on an MPC sampler.It’s the first of three excellent rhythmic tracks at the album’s heart: make sure to stick Exhibition on the best system you can to appreciate the penetrating bass, as well as the melodic effects which recall grime productions (especially Skepta’s signature video-game squelch). As this cosmopolitan album plays through, it’s like being carried with dream logic from garden to mall to club and back again. Chia has said the album is, in part, borne out of “a contemplation of a split soul from living between two places for so long”. She captures the poignancy of living so restlessly, seeing such varied beauty, but never fully building a life around it.Ben Beaumont-ThomasThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenDijon.Photograph: Zachary Harrell JonesDijon – Higher!After co-writing Justin Bieber’s recent UK No 1 Daisies, the R&B musician follows up with his own astounding, surprise-dropped second album.

Having spent two decades retrofitting the breakneck melodic hardcore of their early work with rafter-shaking hooks and gleaming production, the Chicago veterans’ 10th album is a hulking thing, its bombast and righteous anger fed by vocalist Tim McIlrath, who finds the middle ground between Strike Anywhere and Creedence Clearwater Revival more often than you might think possible.View image in fullscreenRise Against: RicochetWorking in tandem with producer Catherine Marks, fresh from Grammy wins for her work onBoygenius’s The Record, and mixer-to-the-stars Alan Moulder, they regularly square the circle between blood-and-guts emotion and high-sheen recording craft. McIlrath’s community-minded political sloganeering finds the perfect vehicle in the wrecking-ball sonics of Sink Like a Stone and Nod, an opener that taps into the double-time urgency of their career-shaping 2006 track Prayer of the Refugee.There is a very fine line between going big and becoming broad, though, and Rise Against do occasionally cross it. I Want It All’s stomping garage rock fails to rise much above pastiche, and power ballad Gold Long Gone is too slick for its own good. They pull it back thanks to moments such as Black Crown. A collaboration with Manchester Orchestra’s Andy Hull, it’s a gut-wrenching warning against apathy as the world burns that also happens to sound like a million bucks.Explore more on these topicsPunkPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Dr Eitan Rose is a hot mess of guilt and self-hatred who buys cocaine from the hospital pharmacist to put in his nasal spray and has a talent for getting himself caught in comically compromising positions. Admittedly, the unexpected death by heart attack of his old enemy, consultant Dr Douglas Moran, does get him out of a tight corner. However, given that the man had just recorded a normal electrocardiogram, Eitan is suspicious – although the police see nothing amiss until his attempts to investigate cause him to become the number one suspect. The mixture of hospital soap, humour – some of it, such as the porter named Cole, rather laboured – and serious point-making won’t work for every reader, but Eitan’s manic energy carries us through what is, on the whole, a zippy and enjoyable read.View image in fullscreenMurder Takes a Vacationby Laura Lippman (Faber, £9.99)Lighter in tone than her previous books, bestselling American writer Lippman’s latest novel puts Muriel Blossom, a supporting actor in the author’s PI Tess Monaghan series, centre stage. The sixtysomething widow is on her first trip to Europe but her plans go awry when she meets the charming Allan on her flight to London and misses her connection. After a delightful day spent in his company, Mrs Blossom continues to Paris as planned, but things take an unexpected turn when she learns that her erstwhile companion has died in suspicious circumstances and it becomes clear that somebody is taking a great deal of interest in the contents of her luggage. And who is the mysterious Danny Johnson, who seems to want to be her new best friend? Masterful plotting and pacing, elements of American-in-Europe-style romantic comedy, a lightness of touch and a delightful protagonist add up to a top-notch holiday read.View image in fullscreenThe Final Vowby MW Craven (Constable, £20)The seventh instalment in Craven’s award-winning series sees grumpy maverick cop Washington Poe recalled from a punishment posting on a Royal Navy/Border Force initiative – we catch up with him as he’s bludgeoning a recalcitrant colleague with a halibut – for the purpose of tracking down a sniper who is causing widespread panic by picking people off, apparently at random, in different locations. There’s plenty of action and some splendid set pieces, including Poe’s visit to trauma therapist Dr Clara Lang, who, it’s fair to say, has some issues of her own. The central “odd couple” relationship between Poe and filterless genius Tilly Bradshaw provides some light relief, as does Poe’s upcoming wedding to sarcastic pathologist Estelle Doyle. Craven sticks to his tried-and-tested formula, complete with a trademark smattering of fascinating facts, and although the dramatic ending is somewhat undermined by an information dump explaining events, this is a high-octane thriller that won’t disappoint.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: book jacketThe Dead Husband Cookbookby Danielle Valentine (Viper, £16.99)When editor Thea is offered a chance to work on a celebrity chef’s tell-all memoir, she jumps at it. Maria Capello not only has a cookery empire – books, a television show and a range of sauces – but she also has a mystery in her life: the chef husband who disappeared 30 years earlier, about whom speculation has long been rife. She is, however, paranoid about leaks, and insists that Thea work on the book at her farm in the Catskill mountains. The place is not quite the Instagrammer’s dream Thea had imagined: it’s isolated and foreboding, with a slaughterhouse on the premises, strange family members and a walk-in freezer that may contain something more than animal carcasses … Atmospheric, suspenseful and studded with interesting recipes (I can vouch for the spiced pear galette), this is a compelling take on marriage, motherhood, love, and the sacrifices that women are routinely expected to make.Explore more on these topicsBooksCrime and thrillers roundupCrime fictionThrillersFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Many of that book’s issues, including the psychic damage he incurred from events he witnessed in Indonesia, East Timor and Afghanistan in the 1990s and early 2000s, are reinflected in this, his first novel.Kit and Lara live in a remote village in the deep rainforest. She works for a small, undependably financed NGO. He’s a stay-at-home husband, living for their baby daughter Helen. While Lara presents as impulsive yet practical and barely able to contain her own energy, Kit is dreamy, internalised, exhibiting a calmness that falls easily into dissociation. “This is your life,” she shouts at him shortly before they leave the UK, “a day of your life, and it requires your presence.” He’s struggling with the local language. His wife has neglected to tell him that he’s speaking it in the female register, which is why the villagers are so amused by him. Beneath the trees, the light is “filtered to a soupy dimness”. The villagers claim to be able to tell a child’s fortune from its teeth. The baby, kept in a heavily air-conditioned pod in the space beneath their stilted house, has a rash. Her future, it seems, will feature a long journey: a prediction, Kit observes politely, that he recognises from fortune tellers in his own country.The cumulative effect is sometimes of a novel that can’t quite decide whether to be closely observant or distanced to abstractionThough there are outright tensions between husband and wife, and a sense that neither of them is entirely connected with their situation, their life maintains a fractious stability until the arrival of English journalist Court Hardy. Hardy brings them up to date on the political context of their idyll, and warns them that they’re now living in the middle of a war. Lara vanishes. After an attack on the village, Kit and his daughter are ejected into the rainforest, along with a villager called Obson, a handful of the village children, and the novel’s MacGuffin – the memory card from Hardy’s camera, which in the right hands will reveal direct superpower interference in the conflict. To say much more about the plot would be to spoil it.We are left to guess where these events occur. Lloyd Parry provides broad clues, but anyway it’s in some sense less a nation than a fabular Everywhere, with the local language known only as “the Tongue”, the country always referred to as “the Country”. The Country has been invaded by “the Neighbour”. The nation financing the war is “the Superpower” (or, as Lara formulates it, “the Confederated States of Uncle Fuckface”). Meanwhile, where Kit and Lara are an easily recognisable contemporary couple, Hardy – stout, middle-aged and blustering, his dialogue cluttered with exclamations such as “Fuckaroo” – strikes the reader as the comedy war correspondent of a previous generation. The cumulative effect is sometimes of a novel that can’t quite decide whether to be closely observant or distanced to abstraction; realistic or rawly satirical. The reader, unsure how or in what direction to suspend disbelief, looks around furtively for authorial support.After this uneasy beginning, In the Green Heart settles to its real task. The forest quickly reveals itself as a central character. Despite his familiarity with its outskirts, Kit is “unprepared for the experience of being enclosed” by it. The air feels “thick and unstirring”. “Time itself,” he muses, was “muffled and distorted”. Obson and the good-natured children pluck “dark festoons” of leeches from each other’s bodies. Kit can’t keep up with them. He feels like “a man swimming in the shallows, who suddenly finds himself above a trench of ocean miles deep”. He’s brought along a compass, but magnetic ores in the surrounding rock render it useless. “It’s OK, Mr Kristian,” Obson reassures him, “I know a way.” But soon enough Obson seems lost, too. As agents of the Superpower close in, intent on retrieving the memory card, the forest becomes the centre of Kit’s struggle against his own personality; only Helen’s few remaining plastic-packaged nappies seem more symbolic. “Crisp as wafers, the opposite of the forest with its wet and profusion, its endless ramifying life”, they console him for his lost entitlement.“The Green Heart” is a nicely ambiguous phrase, suggesting the heart of a forest, certainly; but equally a human heart under-tested by experience. Kit is lost and his core is green, too. All that connects him to his own experience is the relationship of care with his daughter, presented without distance and in constant wonder. We feel it even more powerfully than we feel his glassy, self-protective dissociation, or his furtive admiration for the forest dwellers who keep him and his daughter alive if not entirely “safe”. Helen is an “immense gamble with his own happiness”. His love for her is “helpless, without walls or will”. By the end of the nightmare – and it is a nightmare, determinedly evoked – the war and its politics, particularly in the interplay between global and national, have supplanted both meanings of the title.In a tour-de-force final dialogue between Kit and the recently deposed president of the Country, Lloyd Parry explores the foetid jungle of relationships between local power and superpower. In the Green Heart is a strange tale: a little awkward, intensely political, designed to lay bare the fictions of a contemporary colonialism yet inseparable from the closeup portrait of a man attempting to both shelter in and break out of an internal psychic trap. In short, very contemporary.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Single-player, story-led action experiences with a weekend’s worth of choreographed set pieces and an open world glazed with a fine mist of collectibles … But here in 2025, the age of the Battle Pass and live service forever games, Hangar 13’s solo adventure about Sicilian crime families feels almost as dated as its 1900s setting.In fact, The Old Country has few new ideas to contribute to the cover shooter genre, nor to the Mafia series itself. Hangar 13 already produced aremake in 2020 of the original Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven, but in this game it often feels like the studio’s remaking it yet again in a different setting. Both the storyline and structure of its individual missions seem to be at the very least giving a reverential nod of the fedora to that 2002 title.View image in fullscreenYou can see where this is going … Mafia: The Old Country.Photograph: 2K GamesCase in point: the “win a race to impress your Don” mission trope. This chapter was infamous in the original Mafia because the 1930s race cars were extremely hard to handle and the race was all but unwinnable, but it was also a sophisticated multi-stage mission structure full of sabotage, theft and unexpected double-crossings. Mafia: The Old Country simply has you riding out to a town where a race is due to take place, then tells you the Don needs a replacement rider and drops you into the saddle for an uneventful canter around a course that features no real challenge. Ten years ago, such a by-the-numbers experience would have been criticised, but right now the scarcity of games like this means you’re inclined to look past the basic mission design and enjoy its strongest assets instead: its story, and its sense of time and place.It’s 1904 and you are Enzo Favara, an unfortunate young man with no family to speak of who finds himself working down in the sulphur mines with his fellowcarusiin their yellow-stained rags and shaven heads. After working conditions at the mine tip past horrific and into fatal, Enzo stands up to his sadistic employers and makes a powerful enemy in Don Ruggero Spadaro, the local “businessman” who owns the mine. Not to worry, though – after fleeing, he’s taken in by Don Torrisi, a rival of Spadaro’s, who appreciates the young man’s bravery and work ethic. You can see where this is going.View image in fullscreenRich setting … Mafia: The Old Country.Photograph: 2K GamesWhat follows is your typical ascendancy through the ranks of a crime family, expressed through the medium of knife fights and old timey shootouts, in the era when reloading a pistol takes three to five days. Local businesses refuse to pay up. Workers go on strike. Bandits and rival families threaten your reputation. You journey to a locale that’s conveniently littered with waist-high cover, hunker down and set to them.In fairness to Enzo and his associates, missions aren’t always about all-out violence. At times you’re sneaking around, distracting guards by throwing coins and bottles to lure them away from your path. There’s a lot of riding horses and driving cars and plenty of expository chat to deepen the context of your actions either side of the fracas. These mechanics outside combat are not especially exciting, but this is a mafia game. It’s not trying to be a deep, systems-laden experience – it just wants to tell you a gangster story.And by the skin of its teeth, it succeeds in that endeavour. But it does so via premise rather than plot. The beats are predictable. The memorable moments aren’t clever lines of dialogue or dramatic denouements, but vivid historical details. Pheasants strung up in pantries, baskets of citrus fruit piled high in fields. Workers stamping on grapes in the Torrisi vineyard. Historically accurate recipes for spezzatino di maiale on kitchen counters. The Sicilian dialect peppered throughout each conversation (I heartily recommend going all-in and changing to Sicilian audio localisation with English subtitles). Here is a game that has done its research, and brought to life a geographical and historical setting previously unvisited by games. And done it so well that it proves to be Mafia: The Old Country’s saving grace.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There wasn’t a British classroom without a teenager wearing Jackson’s G-Unit clothing, while his catchy hits Candy Shop and In Da Club dominated the radio. The backstory of this Queens-born New Yorker – how he survived being shot nine times only to become one of the world’s biggest rappers – also made for compelling lore.That year, 50 Cent sold more than a million copies in one week with his sophomore studio album, The Massacre. In a bid to cash in on this superstardom, his label Interscope Records planned a twin strategy: a Hollywood biopic (Get Rich or Die Tryin’) and a licensed video game, 50 Cent: Bulletproof – both to be released by November 2005. “I think the general public are going to be blown away by my game,” 50 Cent told the website IGN. “It feels more like an action film.”British developer GenuineGames, previously responsible for a poorly received Fight Club tie-in, was tasked with creating Fiddy’s 128-bit era adventure. The problem was it only had 11 months to do it. “I remember we’d get to the office at 7am and wouldn’t leave until about 11pm,” recalls the game’s artist Han Randhawa. “We all lived on a diet of KFC. 50 Cent became my whole life. I even read up the doctor’s report from when he got shot, just so I could put bandages on his 3D character in the right places.”The game’s designer, Haydn Dalton, says: “It’s funny, because this was a game about these dudes from the hood, and yet here was this white guy from the north-west of England writing all their in-game dialogue. It was kind of awkward, but I didn’t have much time, so it was about making stuff up on the fly.”View image in fullscreenShoot first, questions later …Photograph: THQTime has been surprisingly kind to50 Cent: Bulletproof, which is 20 this November. In this shooter, 50 Cent gets caught up in a shadowy underground network full of dodgy terrorists, racist biker gangs and mouthy mafia members. Looking to track down whoever riddled him with those nine bullet wounds, 50 and his G-Unit gang (including Tony Yayo, Young Buck and Lloyd Banks) race through inner city environments, shooting first and asking questions later.It’s as if G-Unit has been modelled on the A-Team, with each member bringing something unique (Yayo is an explosives expert; Banks picks locks), while the game also has surprisingly intuitive cover mechanics, whereby your squad ducks behind walls during shootouts. With its screenplay written by the Sopranos’ writer Terence Winter, the cinematic cut-scenes involving 50 Cent conversing with corrupt Det McVicar are a particular thrill.Power player: how 50 Cent went from rapper to unlikely TV kingpinRead moreHe is a dirty cop voiced by a madcap Eminem, who constantly demands more extortion money so he can send his kid to expensive karate classes. The White rapper’s McVicar is joined by Dr Dre, who voices a stoned arms dealer who says things like “That’s some serious shit right there”, whenever 50 Cent purchases a rocket launcher. The game is stacked full of licensed 50 Cent songs, too, meaning you can kick a heavy in the face while Wanksta plays in the background.“We were really blessed, because 50 Cent felt more like a superhero than just a rapper,” explains the game’s director David Broadhurst. “The idea was to make him a Black James Bond.” Yet Broadhurst admits the British development team missed out on a lot of this production’s glitz and glamour. “Vivendi [the game’s publisher] kept us away from 50 Cent and G-Unit; we’d get sent all their audio. I remember 50 Cent had invested in Vitamin Water, so we had to put the drink into the game as a purchasable item.”View image in fullscreenConcept art for 50 Cent: Bulletproof.Photograph: Vivendi Universal GamesSpecific requests are something Randhawa also remembers. He says that G-Unit member Tony Yayo wanted constant revisions made to his character’s face. “I knew I’d done a good job on Yayo,” laughs Randhawa. “When we wrapped one of the executive producers came over to me and was like: ‘The other members of G-Unit say you absolutely nailed Yayo’s ugliness!’”According to Dalton, the original idea was for 50 Cent: Bulletproof to be more of an open world game akin to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. An early build allowed 50 to jump on the subway to navigate the Big Apple, but strict deadlines meant the development team settled for a more straightforward experience. Dalton reveals: “One idea was that 50 managed all these hookers in the street and they’d go out and collect drug money for him. 50 could control these women through a mobile phone and a special Pimp Management System (PMS). I know people might cringe at this feature today, but Bulletproof was a product of its time.”Whereas other rap video games, such as those in the Def Jam fighting series, had violently pinned emcees against one another, Bulletproof refreshingly depicted rappers as the heroes. “It was a nice to have a piece of art where the rapper was the outright hero rather than the antihero,” explains former G-Unit Records’ executive producer Sha Money XL.View image in fullscreen‘If you shot at G-Unit in 2005 then we were gonna shoot back’ …Photograph: Vivendi Universal GamesMoney XL helmed the 50 Cent: Bulletproof soundtrack and he admits the game’s title could easily have been seen by the rapper’s many enemies as a call to violence. “Maybe some people wanted to test if 50 really was bulletproof, but if anyone was going to shoot at G-Unit in 2005 then we were gonna shoot back. Back then, 50 was the kind of person you either loved or you hated.”This divisiveness might explain why 50 Cent: Bulletproof was savaged by critics. The game only has a 52% score on Metacritic, with reviewers criticising the game’s clunky aiming. The game’s director believes there was a clear agenda against the production from the off.“It was obvious a lot of the reviewers hadn’t even played Bulletproof,” Broadhurst says. “Maybe they didn’t like licensed games or a Black lead character who sold drugs. I don’t know, but a lot of people were picking it up expecting something bad and coming away feeling surprised when it turned out to be pretty good.”There were scrapped plans for a direct Bulletproof sequel, where the focus was on urban warfare and G-Unit surviving amid an America caught up in a civil war. However, 50 Cent: Bulletproof did inspire an underrated 2009 sequel via the Swordfish Studios-developed50 Cent: Blood in the Sand, where Fiddy bizarrely fights the war on terror throughout the Middle East, pissed off after having a crystal skull stolen by terrorists.Furious, funny and potentially fatal: hip-hop’s 20 greatest diss tracks – ranked!Read moreThese two 50 Cent titles weren’t a trigger for more hip-hop video games. Dalton has a theory as to why: “50 Cent was the last truly global mainstream rap superstar. There’s been a vacuum since. Even though our game made a lot of money, a new rapper game just isn’t obvious.”Owing to the complex licensing agreements in place, it’s unlikely there will be a remaster of 50 Cent: Bulletproof any time soon. But for those who want a time machine back to 2005, tracking down a copy of the original on eBay is essential.As Dalton puts it: “Yes our game was rushed, but I don’t have any regrets. When you go on Reddit you see a lot of people nostalgic for what we created. I’m not so sure a Drake game would hit the same way as he’s too soft by comparison. There aren’t many rappers right for a video game, but 50 Cent was 100% one of them.”Explore more on these topicsGames50 CentRetro gamesRapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What elevatesMiles., a tribute to jazz legend Miles Davis, is the role of musicianJay Phelps. Not only does he give a credible imitation of Davis’s spare trumpet style, he also plays along convincingly to backing tapes ofKind of Blue, regarded by many as the definitive jazz album.Phelps is more than an incidental player. A constant presence in a production written and directed by Oliver Kaderbhai, Phelps plays a Davis acolyte trying to learn from the master, while the pressure of a record company advance looms over him.What was the secret ingredient, he wants to know, that turned Kind of Blue into a bestselling jazz album? How much did it depend on the collaborators, including John Coltrane and Bill Evans? Where did it fit into the musician’s history of drug abuse and womanising? Now aged 32, the same as Davis at the recording in 1959, could he ever hope to achieve as much?Answering some of these questions – and evading others – is Benjamin Akintuyosi in the title role. With a raspy post-op voice gurgling up from deep in his throat, he plays Davis as sharp, forthright, hard to impress but passionate in his enthusiasms. His is a tale of musical obsession offset by a lack of money; creative innovation offset by racial prejudice.With his influences stretching to Stravinsky, Prokofiev and Debussy, as well as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and the street rhythms of Afro-Irish tap dance, Davis’s musicality is more deeply felt than his Juilliard education might suggest. Kind of Blue, he says in the play, is “my pain on a 78”, an experiment he thought had failed.With projections by Colin J Smith adding to the period detail, the show is a fact-packed, reverent and loving testament to the complicated man behind a musical benchmark.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalMiles DavisJazzreviewsShareReuse this content"

Over 75 minutes, using six puppeteers, two percussionists and a choir of 12 – the excellent Ars Nova Copenhagen – they aim to create the world before our very eyes before nearly destroying it, twice. And all by manipulating some lanterns, a few swathes of silk and a handful of fragments reminiscent of flotsam. The action is measured, the sound world haunting, and the visuals, nimbly lit by Ayumu “Poe” Saegusa, are effective, but it does take a while to get going.Ruo, who was born in China and lives in the US, writes assured, distinctive music, fusing east and west in a way that feels natural and authentic. Here, he deploys an array of tuned and untuned percussion instruments, some of them used in traditional Chinese orchestras, but most familiar to western ears. Gongs, finger cymbals, marimba and Tibetan singing bowls put in appearances, yet all are used sparingly. Vocally, too, there’s a certain austerity, whether in sober chant or rhythmic chatter. Melismatic melodies and ululating choruses lend cross-cultural spice to Ruo’s musical melting pot.The work tells four tales drawn from Chinese myths transcribed in the fourth century BC. Judiciously chosen, their contemporary resonances range from the climate crisis to the boundless hubris of humankind. In the first, the death of the hairy titan Pan Gu creates sun and moon, mountains and rivers, and finally humans. The second tells of a drowned princess reborn as a vengeful bird. The third relates how 10 over-enthusiastic suns are whittled down to one to prevent them burning up the planet, and the fourth how the dim-witted giant Kua Fu tries and fails to capture the sun that remains.View image in fullscreenPuppet masters … Book of Mountains and Seas.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianThe choir, robed like monks and with only their faces illuminated, tackle the intricate lines with confidence and a sure sense of pitch, singing in a combination of Mandarin and an unfathomable made-up language. The former appears now and again as surtitles, the latter does not. It is left to Twist and his puppeteers to tell us what is going on, which on the whole they do with craft and clarity. The imagery for tales one and two is a trifle plain: the story of the embittered bird and the ocean is told with little more than a crimson-fringed kite and a rippling white sheet.The propulsive fourth story, however, where the deconstructed fragments come together to create the sun-hunting giant, is visually arresting. But it’s the stately progression of the 10 lanterns in the third tale, where graceful movement echoes music of piercing beauty, that lingers longest.At theLyceum, Edinburgh, until 16 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Classical musicOperaPuppetryTheatreEdinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a fine set, a candid dispatch (like all Long’s shows) from the frontline of life-as-Josie, now 43, negotiating a painful separation from the father of her kids, and deeply alarmed at the state of the world. It also deftly deploys the defunct animals conceit to excavate optimism in the millennial cycle of extinction and recovery. And optimism, as any Josie fan will tell you, is the Long game.It starts more like early-career, scrapbook-era Long than the recent vintage, with pictures – not always easy to see – of prehistoric predators she’s sketched on flashcards. It’s a hobby, this paleolithic passion, that she’s developed with her children – whom we later meet fraying their mother’s patience with their early rises and demands to be carried, then being coached by Long in far-left politics. Other domestic snapshots include the tale of the recent concussion that changed Long’s perspective on life (including, very funnily, how she experiences the length of each second), and a near-death experience suffered by the family hamster, elsewhere to be found discussing his captivity with the house mice.Thanks for Being Here review – Ontroerend Goed’s joyful show puts the audience in the spotlightRead moreMainly, her attention is given over to larger beasts. Every animal on Earth today, she contends, had a surprisingly larger, or smaller, ancestor. Consider the giant ground sloth, as big as an elephant; then consider what we’ve done to ourselves, removing from the environment almost all the other animals as big as we are. Long’s show toggles between dark despair (at our capacity for destruction, and by extension at “these troubled times”) and wonder, imagining a life for her family in the painted Chauvet caves, 30,000 years ago. That image contrives to be both playful and poignant in Long’s hands, in a show that ranges across territory – much as the dromornithidae and eohippus once did – that other comics seldom approach.AtPleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Josie LongComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not so in I See You Watching. Here, the male view – in particular the male view of women – is insistent, demanding, explicit.Playing a figure of authoritarian power, actor David Calvitto barks out commands: he wants his women to be pretty, demure, sluttish, compliant, hard-working, domestic, worldly, Madonna and whore. He could be running an audition with a keen eye for what the market demands or, more likely, he could be articulating base male desires.And because he is patrolling the auditorium when he issues these instructions, he is on our side, physically if not politically. Objectified on the other side of the footlights is Kylie Westerbeck, playing a wannabe star in spangly majorette gear, clumsily tossing a baton and dancing with ugly enthusiasm. Calvitto wonders if she could be better.Swiping Right review – punchy questions about dating across the political divideRead moreEager to please, ambitious to succeed, she does her best to obey his contradictory commands. She is fashioned in his image and has no resources to argue back. Conditioned from infancy, she has no thought for herself beyond the empty allure of Hollywood fame.Devised by Westerbeck with director Melanie Stewart and writer John Clancy forBlind Faith Theatre, I See You Watching is an extended riff on a simple idea. The more relentlessly it delves, the more it outlines a spectrum of subjugation: at one end, a woman laughs politely at a man’s unfunny jokes; at the other, a child is farmed out to a pornographer.The production makes its point but, for all the charisma of Westerbeck and Calvitto, it makes it bluntly, hammering home a message in a way that is uncomfortable and unnerving even if it should not come as too much of a surprise.AtGilded Balloon, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalWomenreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now 80, he looks backByMichael HannFri 15 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 10.45 EDTShareThere were once two brothers from an Irish background, living in the outer suburbs of a hip city. They got in a band and one of them turned out to be a genius songwriter and arranger. For a few years everything they touched turned to gold. Then they fell out, bitterly, each blaming the other for everything that had gone wrong.It’s the story of not just the Gallagher brothers, but also John and Tom Fogerty. Like Noel, John was the brilliant songwriter, arranger, lead guitarist and producer – but he was also like Liam, the frontman with one of the great rock’n’roll voices. Whereas Tom Fogerty, who had been the original lead singer of the group that eventually becameCreedence Clearwater Revival, had nothing without his brother’s genius.The first strains came when Tom began to resent his younger brother’s leadership, and the demands he made on the rest of the band. It widened when Tom was the first to quit, in 1971. It became a chasm after Creedence completely split. Fantasy, the tiny jazz label that had been the only one to offer the young band a deal – a staggeringly onerous deal, demanding 180 songs over five years on a meagre royalty – freed the other three from their commitments, but refused to let John go, and kept ownership of his songs.Things soured further throughout the 1980s, when John battled to extricate himself from Fantasy, and from the failed offshore savings scheme the label had pushed him into which had left him without any of the rewards from his Creedence years. Each time, Tom took Fantasy’s side, proclaiming John’s nemesis, Fantasy boss Saul Zaentz, to be his friend. The two never reconciled. Tom died, aged 48, in 1990.View image in fullscreenCreedance Clearwater Revival … from left, Doug Clifford, Tom Fogerty, John Fogerty and Stu Cook.Photograph: Didi ZillThe John Fogerty sitting in his home in California – dressed, inevitably, in a plaid shirt, a giant photo of himself on stage in 1969 hanging behind him – is cheery and tolerant on our video call, not the raging man he was through the decades after Creedence split in 1972. He has the stability of a long and happy marriage to his wife, Julie. And, as of two years ago, he has ownership of the 69 songs he wrote for Creedence, 20 of them also additionally rerecorded with two of his sons, Shane and Tyler. They will be released this month as Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years.He looks back over the years when he was fighting for his songs, and sighs. “The best way I can describe it is I was imprisoned wrongfully and sent away to the penitentiary for many, many years.”Creedence, without anyone really noticing, have remained the biggest rock band of the 1960s: of any band from that decade, only the Beatles have more listeners on Spotify each month. Weeks after he turned 80, Fogerty played a barnstormingPyramid stage setat Glastonbury festival this summer, and the greatest hits album, Chronicle – released without Fogerty’s consent in 1976 – is, like, Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours, permanently lodged in the US album chart (currently at No 57). But Creedence don’t have the tumultuous love lives, the thinly veiled Broadway plays and TV dramas, the hanging out with Harry Styles. They may be the most unglamorous major band in rock history.“I’m a great believer in songs,” Fogerty says. “If you have enough songs, even if your playing is kind of average, you can go far.”But why do those songs – Fortunate Son, Bad Moon Rising, Proud Mary, Born on the Bayou, Green River, Have You Ever Seen the Rain, Lodi and so many more – endure so strongly? Perhaps its because Creedence simply sound like America: you can hear John Steinbeck and Mark Twain in them, as well as Little Richard and Howlin’ Wolf. Their name harks back to something innocent, and those plaid shirts – at a time when their California contemporaries were donning hippy finery – kept the package timeless.During his boyhood in the San Francisco Bay Area town of El Cerrito, “I had very strong input,” says Fogerty. “My mom gave me a record when I was three years old, and it was songs by Stephen Foster. She explained that he had been a songwriter.” Foster, a century earlier, had composed many of the songs that passed down in American folklore – Oh! Susanna, Camptown Races and more. Fogerty also paid attention to Pete Seeger and the folk revival, and to country music. “Even though I always considered myself pretty much a mainstream rock’n’roll kid, all these other influences were there.”By the time Creedence broke through in 1968 with a cover of Dale Hawkins’ Susie Q – the start of an astounding run that resulted in nine Top 10 hit singles up to Sweet Hitch-Hiker in 1971, and three classic albums in 1969 alone – the Fogertys, and rhythm section Stu Cook and Doug Clifford, had been making records under various names and in varying line-ups since 1961. By the time he started writing for Creedence, Fogerty knew exactly what he wanted to achieve. Each side of a seven-inch single was rehearsed for six weeks before recording it to achieve maximum impact, and the other three were instructed in exactly how they had to play.I never really thought I had a nervous breakdown, but I would say I was not wellThe result was that Creedence sounded like the tightest, most powerful garage band in the world. They were a juggernaut, but they could convey emotion as well. “For every song I wrote I threw 10 away,” Fogerty says. “When you heard one of my songs, I wanted there to be no doubt it was a really good song. It sounds grandiose to say it, but I was trying to have that as my career goal.”With no competent manager and a label that didn’t have a clue, Fogerty determined he would have to do everything. “The absolute coin of the realm, the only thing that I had to spend, was the music I could create. I became manic about it, but also paranoid, meaning I just had to work really, really hard. Whatever energy I had, I applied it completely to furthering the career of the band. And when the jealousy [from the other three members, who also wanted to write songs] began, I thought I could cure that by working hard.”View image in fullscreen‘For every song I wrote, I threw 10 away’ …Photograph: David McListerBut it didn’t work. Tom left after their sixth album, Pendulum. Fogerty believes it’s because his bluff had been called: he knew he would have to write songs for the next one, and that he wasn’t good enough to step up. So for the final one, Mardi Gras, Fogerty let Clifford and Cook write. “It was something I had been putting off, or pushing back against, because I thought they were incapable and it would mean career suicide.” It turned out to be just that – panned by critics, it failed to make the US Top 10 and Fogerty later called it “horse manure”. On 16 October 1972, Creedence announced their split.Thus began the wilderness years. There was a solo album in 1973, of covers, but Fogerty still owed Fantasy eight original albums. So he went on strike, until David Geffen bought out his deal and brought him to Asylum for one underpowered record in 1975, and then more or less nothing until 1985’s hit album Centerfield, which resulted in him being sued by Zaentz for plagiarising himself. Fogerty won that one, but had to pay Zaentz for defamation over the song Zanz Kant Danz (later rerecorded and renamed Vanz Kant Danz). And still Zaentz wouldn’t sell him the Creedence catalogue.What Fogerty describes in his autobiography – an inability to write any new songs, an allergic reaction to his old ones (he would turn off the radio if they came on), a refusal to play live in any meaningful sense, periods of heavy drinking, reckless behaviour, disturbed sleep – sounds like an ongoing, decades-long breakdown.“I never really thought I had a nervous breakdown, but I would say I was not well,” he says. “Not stable, or even-keeled, or normal. It would manifest itself in strange ways: I remember going into a department store to buy some socks, and I was unable to approach the salesperson because it was far too complicated for me. It sounds pathetic.”No, it doesn’t. It sounds like someone very sick.“Yeah. I guess I might have seen a shrink, but I was in the middle of the stream swimming and just trying to keep my head above water.” The rage, he says, could make him difficult to be around. “I tried to be nice. I tried to be humble, but there were times when I would explode. That could come out if I was near people, or even if I was quite alone. It happened a few times when I was alone in the wilderness, fishing, and I’d just go off into a rage about my gear.”I tell him it sounds as though, more than anything else, he needed someone to take care of him. He had been, in effect, chief executive of a multinational company before he was 25, and had been working since childhood. Everyone who was meant to take care of him had let him down.“Well, yes, that’s true. And, boy, there’s nothing like that sense that somebody cares for you and they’re taking care of you. After I met Julie, she insisted some therapy would help me. I was telling the doctor about my situation with the band and he said, ‘Well, that’s betrayal. You were betrayed.’ And that’s the first time I’d been given a word to describe the situation.”Proud Mary (Live in Hackney, London at EartH Theatre)Fantasy wasn’t the issue by this point. Zaentz was. So when he sold his share of the company to Concord in 2004, Fogerty returned more or less immediately. Concord now owned the Creedence catalogue, and had no desire to make an enemy of their signing. Almost immediately, it reinstated the royalties Fantasy had previously withheld, and it was open to selling Fogerty his songs. It took a further 19 years, but it did happen, and Fogerty was delighted. “This is something I thought would never be a possibility,” he tweeted in January 2023. “After 50 years, I am finally reunited with my songs.”The first fruits of that ownership come in the form of the Legacy album. One of the first songs he worked on for it was what he believes to be his first great song, Proud Mary, the unlikely rock’n’roll number about a Mississippi paddle steamer. He built up the backing track, making it sound ragged and raw but thrillingly precise, exactly as Creedence did. Then he listened back to his first vocal takes.“There was what they call an epiphany. The track sounded really stunning, and the lead vocal paled by comparison. And it finally dawned on me: John, when you were doing this way back when, it was life or death for you. I came from a state of if not poverty, then the lower economic rungs. It was very important and necessary to be great, as great as whatever was in me. And at that point I felt as if I was going through a portal, and really trying to be that person again. I continued to work on Proud Mary that way and I ended up in a place I felt very good about.“My wife told me she’d been watching me from the control room, and she said she could see it in my face that I actually was making myself go back, so I continued to work that way with the rest of the songs. I’m just an adventurer, you know, like an explorer coming back to the homeland.”It’s an oddity that Fogerty’s legacy rests on songs written in such a short span of time. Only two of his solo albums (Centerfield and 1997’s Blue Moon Swamp) come within spitting distance of Creedence. It’s terrifying, too, that a song such as Fortunate Son – about how the sons of wealth avoid fighting the wars their fathers profit from – remains relevant, especially now the US is governed by one of those fortunate sons.View image in fullscreenFogerty on stage at Glastonbury in June.Photograph: Shane Anthony Sinclair/Getty Images“I wrote that song during the administration of Richard Nixon. NowDonald Trumpis almost a direct descendant, skipping the years since 1974. Of course, Mr Trump is doing everything on steroids compared to Nixon. I think Nixon did have some shame. I don’t get that sense these days.”Fogerty, the all-American musician (right down to being a hunter), must have some pretty staunch Maga types among his fans. Does that trouble him? “There’s certainly no secret about a song like Fortunate Son, or Who’ll Stop the Rain” – the rain representing the rot in the Nixon era. “You know what my worldview must be. But I don’t hold fans responsible for the activities of Mr Trump. I wish everyone was a little bit more towards the middle. The older you get, you’re just sorry that everything’s so kneejerk.”The great imponderable, given how much misery it caused him, is whether Fogerty might have been happier without his success. If he had written and recorded all those songs, but no one had ever bought them and there had been no money to fight over, would he have happily gone back to El Cerrito?John Fogerty review – a triumphant celebration of Creedence Clearwater classicsRead more“I like to hope that being a history teacher – if I found my partner and had this wonderful life I have found – would have made me very happy. But my second answer … I don’t know if you can see the picture on the wall behind me.” He gestures to that print of him in full flight as a young man.“Someone asked me about that, about a month ago: ‘Tell me about that guy up on the wall back there.’ Maybe a couple days before that particular question had been asked, I actually had this conversation in my mind: John, would you trade places and be that 24-year-old who was so confused and unhappy and scratching his head trying to figure out life? Would you trade places? Or would you be the person you are now at 80? And my answer was, and it’ll always be, I want to be the guy I am here now, even though I’m 80. That poor young man had youth, for sure, but he was so confused about what was going on with his gift. I wouldn’t want to live even one day like that. I prefer being really happy, very settled, completely in love with my wife, Julie, having raised great kids. It’s a sense of being that’s irreplaceable.”Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years is released 22 August on ConcordThis article was amended on 15 August 2025. Tom Fogerty died when he was 48, not 58 as an earlier version of this article said.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockDonald TrumpinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The 87-year-old British director has directed 30 films: his first, The Duellists with Tom Conti and Harvey Keitel, came out in 1977, and his newest, The Dog Stars, starring Guy Pearce and Josh Brolin, is due in 2026.What’s perhaps as impressive as his epic vision as a director, has been his important – and frequently unorthodox – choices. For 1979’s Alien, he cast Sigourney Weaver over the more traditional male hero. He only agreed to direct 1982’s Blade Runner after becoming inpatient and leaving what became 1994’s Dune. Scott bought the rights to 1991’s Thelma & Louise for $500,000 after chancing upon the script. He was convinced to direct 2000’s Gladiator when he was showna 19thcentury painting by French artist Jean-Léon Gérômeof the crowd giving a thumbs down (as in: kill him) to a winning gladiator, standing over his defeated opponent.View image in fullscreenSigourney Weaver and Ridley Scott on the set of Alien, 1979.Photograph: Ronald GrantHad Scott chosen different projects, would cinematic history have been altered? What if he hadn’t turned down Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines to do 2001’s Black Hawk Down? For every Kingdom of Heaven, Matchstick Men and Robin Hood, there lies an unmade Ridley Scott epic. His recent years have seen him trap Matt Damon on Mars in The Martian, turn Joaquin Phoenix into Napoleon, and reboot Gladiator. He’s also returned to the Alien franchise with Prometheus and Alien Covenant, and was apparently so convinced when shown around the set of the newAlien: Earth TVprequel series, the first thing he said was:“Fuck me, that’s my set.”For lucky Londoners, the BFI Southbank is staging a celebratory Ridley Scott season this September and October, including an in-person Q&A on 5 October. But you can get in there first as the great man has agreed to sit for the Guardian Readers Interview. There’s plenty to ask. What’s the best perk of being a Sir? Does he have a special hotline to Russell Crowe, who’s starred in five Ridley Scott movies? Does he regret leaving his 1960s job as a set designer on Doctor Who?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the actors and writers Linus Karp and Joseph Martin will be tying the knot at the Edinburgh fringe, walking down the aisle of the Pleasance Grand on Saturday. Tickets to attend are £12 a pop – and they hope to avoid getting star ratings.“It’s surprisingly affordable,” says Martin. “We’d been looking at doing it in London and that was ‘the first Tuesday of every month at 8.30am, only bookable three years in advance’. Our work is loud, queer and joyous, and this felt like a good way to represent that side of us. It’s silly and ridiculous, but it feels right.” There will be a dramatic entrance and special-guest speeches, but their vows will be real. “We wouldn’t ever do anything for attention,” deadpans Karp.It will, however, do no harm in raising the profile of their other show,The Fit Prince(Who Gets Switched on the Square in the Frosty Castle the Night Before [Insert Public Holiday Here]). The show grew out of their binge-watching of romantic films during a bout of Covid and, like their previous tributes to Princess Diana andGwyneth Paltrow, is served with a mixture of camp irony and genuine affection.“Audiences can tell when you’ve done something with derision,” says Martin. “We love the films on which it is based, the good and the bad – and, boy, are there many bad ones!”As the big day approaches, how are the pre-wedding jitters? “This is the first time we have debuted a show in Edinburgh so maybe this level of stress will change things,” says Karp. “We’ll see if halfway through the fringe we still want to get married.”‘It’s physically demanding – you can’t let your partner down’View image in fullscreen‘Opening in Edinburgh has been vulnerable and exhilarating’ … Isak and Eowynn Enquist.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianA double helping of married couples are responsible for the aerial dance showImago. Created by two former Cirque du Soleil stars, this “epic tragic love story” is now entrusted to another husband and wife. And “entrusted” is the right word: nothing symbolises dependency more powerfully than an acrobat holding on to an airborne partner. Using apparatus devised to keep the performers in the air for unusually long periods, this is a show requiring high levels of trust.“It is emotionally and physically demanding and we know we can’t let our partner down on stage,” says Gabrielle Martin, who developed Imago with Jeremiah Hughes before she retired from the stage. “The truth is that gravity is trying to pull us apart. The chemistry and the struggle are real.”Hughes describes a three-minute sequence in which he would be suspended in the air with his wife hanging on his foot: “At no point was I thinking, ‘This feels hard on my body, we should have a break.’ It was: ‘She’s 15 feet off the ground. There’s no question of stopping.’”The couple are now directingEowynn and Isak Enquist in Imago, which has the dreamlike aesthetic of dance, rather than the shock and awe of circus. “It’s a cathartic journey for the audience,” says Martin. “And it is for Eowynn and Isak on stage.”For Martin and Hughes, working and playing together – not to mention bringing up a two year old – is a natural state of affairs. “So many of our production conversations are pillow talk,” says Hughes. “This work has brought a lot of beauty into our life and we’ve truly enjoyed placing it on to these new performers, who have also had to learn how to communicate when they’re exhausted and in the air. I don’t know that it could have happened with two that were not in an intimate relationship.”Martin adds: “We know how intense Edinburgh is, having been there once before – I remember crying my way home every other night.” How are the Enquists holding up? “People said it was going to be a whirlwind experience: we now understand what they meant. We have been training for Imago for two years – opening in Edinburgh has been vulnerable and exhilarating.”‘It’s easier to create an hour-long show to express how you feel than say it directly’View image in fullscreen‘Marnina and Micah get along way better than Eric and I’ … Chris Grace (seated) and Eric Michaud, directors of Couplet: Honey Honey Moon Moon.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianA honeymoon comedy set in the aftermath of a calamitous wedding is the work of another double helping of married couples. Created by Los Angeles musical duo Marnina Schon and Micah O’Konis, both fringe newcomers,Couplet: Honey Honey Moon Moonis directed by comedians Chris Grace and Eric Michaud, both Edinburgh old-hands.Revelling in their own cantankerousness, Grace and Michaud have been energised by the positive vibes of the younger couple. “Marnina and Micah get along way better than Eric and I do,” laughs Grace.“They’re much better fighters, I guess,” says Michaud. “Or they’re conflict avoidant,” says Grace. “It’s an ongoing debate about whether we want to model our relationship on theirs or they want to model theirs on ours.”View image in fullscreenHeightened comedy … Marnina Schon and Micah O’Konis, stars of Couplet: Honey Honey Moon Moon.Photograph: Jack MorrisSchon and O’Konis are classically trained musicians who tell the story of their relationship from inception to marriage through songs such as Our Wedding Venue Burned Down. The distinctive nature of their genderqueer relationship is summed up in People Think We’re Straight.“With Eric and me, it’s pretty obvious if we’re holding hands that we’re gay,” says Grace. “Marnina and Micah present as heteronormative. We were both at their wedding earlier this year and when family members gave speeches they used correct pronouns, which was a big milestone for them.”The show sees the funny side of all this. “They quote a line from aNew York Times interviewthat says there’s nothing they can’t sing and laugh their way through – and that’s really true,” says Michaud. “Rather than fighting, they’ll sit down and write a song. They’ll harness those feelings and create something out of it.”“They’re probably like us in that it’s almost easier to create an hour-long show to express how you feel than say it directly,” says Grace, who is also creating a new standup show every afternoon in27 Hours. “There’s a heightened comedic sensibility to their show but there’s not a ton of artifice.”Michaud agrees: “They seem unshakable as a couple, which is inspiring.” Grace quips back: “They have a joie de vivre that, as middle-aged men, we do not share.”‘We go to each other for solace’View image in fullscreenAbigail and Shaun Bengson, stars of Ohio.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianIf you want to know what love at first sight feels like, just ask Abigail and Shaun Bengson. Eighteen years ago, Abigail was invited to join Shaun’s band. Straight away they wrote a song. Three weeks later they were married.“Since then it’s all been making art together,” says Shaun, arriving in Edinburgh from the US with his parents and two children. Having met through music, they find it impossible to distinguish between their creative life and any other aspect of their relationship. “We were fired in the kiln of being musicians,” says Abigail. “We go to each other for solace.”Their show,Ohio, a music-theatre hybrid, is autobiographical in a way that both find exposing. It is about Shaun’s inherited degenerative hearing loss, their movement away from religion and their coming to terms with mortality. They call it an “ecstatic grief concert”.“The stage is where I feel the most unmasked and the most free,” says Abigail. “It is a vulnerable place to be but it’s also a place of power. Shaun and I are both disabled and our situations are degenerative. We’ve thought of it as a bummer, but mostly because it’s new and scary. We’re making this to get less afraid and more free about what it means to be a person moving into disability.”A few days in, the couple have tackled their fringe debut with characteristic enthusiasm. “It’s been gorgeous,” they say. “We’re entering the review maelstrom so we’re holding each other close: as autistic folks we’re used to being misunderstood and underestimated. What matters most is what happens in the room, which is when we feel most joyful.”‘We’ve been too exhausted to talk to each other’They met through comedy, working together on student sketches at the University of Bristol, and when lockdown put everything on hold, Ada Player and Bron Waugh simply carried on improvising. With a relationship like that, it is little wonder that their debut fringe show,Ada and Bron: The Origin of Love, is a compendium of offbeat skits on a theme of intimacy.“They’re characters we’ve been improvising since university and they all ended up being doomed romances and weird couples,” says Waugh, whose work on television with Player includes the short Channel 4 comedy Peaked. “We’ve taken tiny nuggets of our relationship, timesed them by 10 and made them into these cartoonish love stories,” says Player.View image in fullscreen‘The whole show is done in our pants and vest tops’ … Ada Player and Bron Waugh, stars of The Origin of Love.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianHow is their work/life balance? “You can make rules about not talking about the show in the evening, but sometimes it’s fun to do that,” she says. “It’s a constant back and forth. But it has made our stress around the show low, because if it’s our whole life, everything has to feel fun, light and energetic.”Waugh looks uncertain about that, but stressful or not, working from home has given The Origin of Love its distinctive quality. “We made the show in this closed space,” says Player. And even the costumes reflect the lockdown theme. “The whole show is done in our pants and vest tops,” says Waugh, although pianist Ed Lyness will be in a tux. “That would normally be something we’d be shy about, but because we’ve made the show in our bedrooms, we’ve not thought about what it would feel like in front of people.”Are there any tensions between Ada and Bron after their opening gigs? “Our show is at 11pm so resetting our body clocks means we’ve been too exhausted to talk to each other, let alone fight,” says Waugh. “Once we have settled into a rhythm we will have more energy to have a proper domestic,” says Player. “Honestly, can’t wait!”The Fit Prince …is at Pleasance Courtyard until 25 August.Awkward Prods Get Married (But for Real)is at Pleasance Courtyard on 16 August.Imagois at Assembly Roxy until 24 August.Couplet: Honey Honey Moon Moonis at Assembly Rooms until 24 August.Ohiois at Assembly Roxy until 24 August.Ada and Bron: The Origin of Loveis at Pleasance Courtyard until 24 August.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalFestivalsTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was a volunteer in the playground at my kids’ school in Littleton, Colorado, and when the school announced they were going to have a Crazy Hair Day for dads, I said, “Let’s do a mohawk!” My kids thought it was a great idea. So I went to the barber shop and came back with a small mohawk.My wife, Julie, wasn’t so keen, and I promised I’d shave it off the next day. But my hair went down really well in the playground and I decided to keep it like that for a while. The community we live in is a small one and very conservative, but everyone seemed to accept my new look, even though some people said I must be having a midlife crisis.Julie works in education and had no real experience of styling anyone’s hair when she started helping with mine. Through trial and error she got really good at it – now she’s the artist and I’m her palette. I think the first picture mohawk we did was a phoenix, then an Irish flag to celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day.After that, I’d just suggest whatever came into my head. My mohawk became a billboard for music I liked – Lynyrd Skynyrd, Metallica, Modern English – as well as important causes, both local and international. I’d also celebrate birthdays and memorialise people who had died.Experience: I was attacked by a wild tigerRead moreMy boss at the grocery store where I worked made no objection, perhaps partly because people would come in just to see what design I was wearing that day. I loved creating holiday mohawks. I’ve had the Easter bunny pooping jelly beans on my head, while for Halloween I’d go out with it covered in cartoon pumpkins. At Christmas, Julie would paint it green and decorate it with real fairy lights and baubles, or shape it into a pair of reindeer antlers.Early on, we started posting pictures of our designson Facebookand later we opened an accounton Instagram, too. That’s when I started to get attention from outside our town, quickly racking up followers. About a year in, I received my first commission – a doughnut shop in Washington DC got in touch to ask if I had ever considered putting the name of a company on my mohawk. We didn’t know what to charge so we just said $75 (£56), and were astonished when they paid.Nowadays, we make sure to always have about a dozen colours of spray in our cupboard, as you never know from one day to the next what people are going to ask for. We’ve bought a proper stencil machine, too. At first, Julie cut those out by hand, and did a pretty good job, but now they’re perfect every time.Despite everything I’ve put it through, I still have a solid hairline for a 58-year-oldGetting the mohawk up takes about 15 minutes, but painting it can take anything from one to three hours. Some weeks I become burned out and take a little break, but on others we’ll do five paid ads on one side of my mohawk and five of our own design on the other. We charge more now; we’ve reached the point where the mohawk commissions pay all our bills and I don’t have to go out to work.I’ve learned to avoid any overtly political messages, as when you’re posting on social media they can become an open door to hell. But I enjoy recording short videos and reels to back up the messages on my hair. My aim when I started out was “Bringing back smiles, one mohawk at a time”. And, several thousand mohawks later, that hasn’t changed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Given that all this started as a joke, it’s amazing where it has ended up. We’re even looking at opening a themed business, The Mohawk Bob Bar & Grill.Nowadays, my mohawk is 14in (35cm) tall – a good size for painting messages on, but not too large to be impractical. I’ve seen specimens much taller than mine, but something that big wouldn’t fit in my car. Despite everything I’ve put it through, I still have a solid hairline for a 58-year-old – I’ve been pretty lucky with that. Perhaps one day it’ll all fall out and I’ll have to start faking it, but until then, I don’t think my mohawk’s ever coming off.As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

After many evenings involving wine and a lot of begging not to sell to anyone else, the neighbour finally revealed she wanted to downsize. “I was poised to strike, but was convinced it would fall through” says Duke. “We ended up swapping houses, which was an unusual way to move, but it suited us both.”View image in fullscreenFiona Duke in the front room. The rug, from Etsy, dictated the colours of the Soho Home sofas. The fireplace is from the Architectural Forum; wall lights from Pure White LinesDuke was very familiar with the layout of the house, in Old Moulsham, Chelmsford, by the time they moved in, and was eager to get on with the modernisation. However, having stretched themselves to the limit with a hefty mortgage, Duke had agree with her husband not to begin any work until they had the money, so it was years before she could start. “Nothing worked. The water flow was awful and we had to live with it for six years, which was tough. On the upside, it was great for parties, as we didn’t really care what happened to it!”Once she got started though, it was all systems go. The family moved out for a year, but Duke was on site every day, working from her studio in the garden. The house was gutted and an extension over the garage was built, followed by a full internal refit, transforming the place from creaky and drab to thoroughly inspiring and full of colour.View image in fullscreen‘If it’s a dark space, embrace that,’ says Fiona. ‘For the snug, I already had the corner sofa and simply worked around it.’ The joinery screening is by Luxmoore & CoThe refurbishment started with the head-turning entrance hall. “It’s very wide, so it could take a lot of pattern, hence the encaustic reclaimed floor tiles, which came from an old Spanish casa,” says Duke. “I’d had them in the garage for years before I could lay them. I still get a buzz seeing them.”A snug, with joinery painted a warm brick shade, has been created in a narrow space running adjacent to the hall, with a new internal screen replacing the wall, to let in some light. “It’s easy to see why people love snuggling up in there. It’s cosy; the most popular room in the house.”While the front room is largely unchanged structurally, a reclaimed red marble fireplace has added some drama, as have vintage Italian wall lights, which happily rub shoulders with a designer pendant from Pinch. Duke admits to being obsessed with lighting and had bought every lamp and shade before work started. “Having the lights means you can decide and fit them while the electrician is on-site. It’s very difficult to do this retrospectively.”View image in fullscreenThe flat-fronted wooden units in the kitchen, with exposed dovetail joints, by Luxmore & CoThe back of the house has been meticulously planned and encompasses spacious kitchen, dining and lounging areas, into which natural light flows through huge steel-framed windows. Duke sketched out a design for the kitchen, with cabinetry by Luxmore & Co, favouring flat-fronted wooden units with exposed dovetail joints to further elevate them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHouse to HomeFree weekly newsletterEight emails packed with tips to brighten up your home - whatever your budgetEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I chose leather for the seats to make it super hard-wearing.” A utility room opens off the live/eat space, as does a cold store-cum-larder, which has been given a colour drench in a muddy bronze/green.Upstairs, a super-king bed in the main bedroom is flanked by space-saving bedside tables. The muted floral wallpaper has a clever pattern that gives vibrancy, and artworks hung off-centre add a quirky feel. “My husband can’t get his head around these, but I like a vignette. It makes things come together very satisfyingly, if a little to one side, and a vase or lamp can take your eye to a different place.”View image in fullscreen‘The reclaimed hall tiles are very forgiving,’ says Fiona. The sideboard, left by previous owners, is a nice foil to the contemporary artworkThe children’s bedrooms are decorated in cheery contemporary schemes with fun retro accents; pinstripe wallpaper for her daughter’s room, with a mustard velvet upholstered bed; and for her son’s, a sky-blue painted half-wall that makes the orange elements in the accessories and bedding pop.The family bathroom has been enlarged to allow the shower to have a deeper recess. Like other rooms it’s decorated in a pleasing melange of designer and high street finds. The wall lights are Fritz Fryer numbers; the stool is Ikea basic. “I like to create eclectic, elegant spaces, mixing modern with vintage and reclaimed materials,” Duke says. “Embracing imperfections with these older pieces helps to create a relaxed, authentic way of living, and that makes me very happy.”Explore more on these topicsInteriorsHomesDesignfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Whisky – or whiskey if we’re talking about the Irish or American stuff – continues to enjoy widespread appeal. Whether you’re picking up a bottle for your scotch-loving relative’s birthday, restocking the home bar or looking for a couple of new nightcaps, the choice can be pretty overwhelming.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.While scotch is arguably the most famous type of whisky, there’s quality and interest to be found far and wide, with premium distilleries doing exciting things in places such as India, Japan, the Nordic countries and beyond. The beauty of whisky-making is that so much expression comes from the landscape where the grain and water are sourced, together with the skill and preferences of the blender; so each whisky’s profile offers something different to be explored.From smoothly sweet Speyside whiskies to the harmonious balance of the Japanese blends, all the way up to the seriously spendy aged single malts, tasting and trying is the only way to discover which whisky tickles your fancy beyond these loose geographic profile styles.But, after carefully testing every whisky on this list against many more, I’m satisfied there is something here to please every palate. Spicy rye just asking to be made into a manhattan, silky bourbons to satisfy your inner Don Draper and a surprising English entry I can’t get enough of; these are my top whisky picks to buy right now.I tasted each one neat – to get a clear comparison across the board, you understand – before mixing up any cocktails that the style particularly inspired, and I suggest you do the same. The fun’s all in the trying.The best whisky in 2025Best aged single maltView image in fullscreenGlenmorangie 18-year-old the Infinita, 70cl£123.95 at Master Of Malt£123.88 at AmazonIt’s easy to spend silly money on aged single malts, but this (almost) accessibly priced 18-year-old Glenmorangie is a safe bet for scotch fans. Its honeyed spice notes morph into burnt orange, jasmine and wood smoke for a deeply delicious dram for any whisky connoisseur. This tasted fantastic rounding off a special dinner as a celebratory digestif.Best sustainable whiskyView image in fullscreenNc’nean organic single malt,70cl£51.75 at the Whisky Exchange£55 at Master of MaltMade from organic barley on the wild west coast of Scotland, Nc’nean is single malt scotch – but not as you know it. Female-founded, B Corp-certified and the first UK whisky distillery to achieve net zero emissions, it tastes good and does good. It’s also a Great Taste Award winner. It’s fresh and lively with lemon and opens up to candied citrus sweets with a dash of tropicality. I found it divine in a highball with a sprig of fresh mint.Best unusual whiskyView image in fullscreenRampur double cask single malt whisky,70cl£56 at Majestic£59.99 at AmazonIndia may not be the first place you think of for whisky – but think of India you should. Rampur Distillery has been distilling for almost a century using Himalayan groundwater to add a uniquely Indian flavour. Extreme weather means the casked whisky matures rapidly, leading to deeper levels of flavour and complexity. Think heady cinnamon spice, salted caramel and all things nice in this must-try bottle.Best aged blended whiskyView image in fullscreenGlenAllachie White Heather 15-year-old, 70cl£57.50 at Master of Malt£57.50 at the Whisky ExchangeWhite heather is a rare variant of the ubiquitous purple flower with rich symbolism in Scottish folklore; stumbling across a patch is said to bring luck, and brides often include a sprig in their bouquet. Lucky you to be trying this wonderful blend from GlenAllachie’s master distiller, I say. Single malts from across Scotland combine to create a heather-honeyed balance of oranges, mocha and a faint wisp of smoke – I found it dangerously drinkable.Best peated whiskyView image in fullscreenTobermory Ledaig 10-year single malt scotch, 70cl£40.75 at the Whiskey Exchange£38.95 at AmazonHailing from the Inner Hebridean Isle of Mull, this is a more approachable peated whisky than the famed neighbouring Islay styles. More freshness and minerality make for a more measured sip, yet it still retains that unmistakable smoky island character. Soft peat mingles with a medicinal nose that’s happily more peppery and vanilla-based on the palate, though the background of smoke persists. At this price, you can afford to try it even if you think island whiskies aren’t for you; you may just surprise yourself.Best Japanese whiskyView image in fullscreenThe Matsuisakura cask whisky, 70cl£165 at Selfridges£134.91 at AmazonThe Kurayoshi Distillery has been producing spirits since 1910, using fresh volcanic water from nearby Mount Daisen’s snowmelt. This single malt’s pale hue offers no hint of the richness within, which boasts a floral, spicy nose and bold bakery flavours, with pepper on the palate. The floweriness on the finish is a fitting nod to the Japanese cherry blossom sakura casks used to age the whisky. I found this opened up nicely with a drop of water.Best small-batch whiskyView image in fullscreenHolyrood Distillery Ambir single malt, 70cl£58.25 at the Whisky Exchange£63.95 at Royal Mile WhiskiesFresh from winning gold in the small-batch category at the World Whiskies Awards, Ambir is the third iteration of single malts from newcomer Holyrood Distillery. Using four speciality malts chosen for their dessert-style textures and flavours, Ambir is perfect for enjoying as an after-dinner drink. The tempting tastes of Scottish tablet, buttery fudge and jammy cornflake tart abound, with a subtle leathery savouriness taking it back from the brink of being too simplistic. Enjoy with – or as – pudding.Best experimental whiskyView image in fullscreenNoble Rebel Hazelnut Harmony, 70cl£37 at Master of Malt£39.95 at the Whisky ExchangeGo nuts for this boldly experimental blended whisky from Loch Lomond Distillery, where toasted hazelnuts, almonds and oak are expertly layered with indulgent vanilla and honeycomb flavours and more than a touch of pear crumble. Using fine single malts from across the country, this is a mouthwatering marriage of grains if you like your whiskies sweet, sticky and smoke-free.Best bourbonView image in fullscreenWoodford ReserveKentucky bourbon, 70cl£37.50 at Morrisons£39 at the Whisky ShopThis universally popular super-smooth bourbon is as good as a gift as it is for drinking yourself. Kentucky’s favourite straight, Woodford Reserve is harmoniously balanced, with warming aromas, dried fruit and a creamy finish. Best enjoyed neat – although it’s also my go-to for a Don Draper-worthy old fashioned.Best Speyside whiskyView image in fullscreenBenromach Contrasts Organic Speyside single malt, 70cl£51.75 at the Whisky Exchange£51.75 at Master of MaltThis is the whisky that first made me fall in love with whisky. Impossibly smooth, with unexpected but harmonious flavours of banana split, a hit of pepper and tons of malt, Benromach Contrasts Organic is typically Speyside in terms of its sweetness and light, but with a cocoa richness, aged maturity and interest that its price tag suggests. It’s also the world’s first Soil Association-accredited organic scotch. Drinks like a dream in a hip flask on a cold country walk.Best Islay whisky selectionView image in fullscreenSmokehead whisky skull gift tin, 3 x 5cl£24.95 at Royal Mile Whiskies£18.45 at AmazonFans of Islay scotch will enjoy making their way through this Smokehead selection flight. There are three single malts laden with seaweed, fiery peat and sweetness to be explored: original; High Voltage 58%; and Rum Rebel, which is matured in Caribbean rum casks for a tropical explosion alongside the signature sea spray and smoke.Best whisky gift setView image in fullscreenIsle of Raasayscotchgift set,70cl£69.99 at SelfridgesThe rugged Hebridean island of Raasay (population 194) is home to Raasay Distillery, which produces this lightly peated single malt. Matured in rye, oak and bordeaux casks, this is a complex drop with flavours of wild dark fruit, toffee, spice and smoke. Take this smartly boxed set next time you need a dinner party gift for a whisky-drinking host: two beautifulGlencairntasting glasses are included alongside the decanter-style bottle for sharing.Best sherry-led whiskyView image in fullscreenThe LakesWhiskymaker’s Reserve No7, 70cl£83.75 at the Whisky Exchange£84.50 at AmazonThe Lakes Distillery has quickly made a name for itself in new world whisky, and with expressions like this one, I can see why. The Whiskymaker’s Reserve No 7 is a single malt made in the image of whiskies likeDalmore; sherry-led, matured in oloroso and pedro ximénez casks, plus a few red wine casks thrown in for good measure. The result is richly fruited with warming spices and layers of woodiness, complex, clever and evocative of long Lake District walks. While it’s not the most affordable whisky on this list, you won’t regret putting your hand in your pocket for a little treat this tempting.Joanne Gould is afood, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Skin feels the effects of travelling even if you’re not moving outside your time zone. As consultant dermatologist Dr Anjali Mahto says, long stints sitting in train carriages, ferries, cars or planes “expose skin to stressors, such as aircon or low cabin humidity, which can make it feel tight or dry, due to what’s known as transepidermal water loss.” She adds that “disrupted sleep patterns, dehydration from limited water intake, and poor diet choices” can lead to dullness, puffiness and inflammation.Eyes are particularly affected by long trips, especially if you’re looking at a phone or other screen for long periods, or a contact lens wearer with naturally dry eyes like myself. “Screens cause us to blink less, while dry air and overall dehydration can leave eyes gritty, sore and tired,” says consultant ophthalmic surgeon Ali Mearza. However, a little pampering on the go, plus some smart tech, can help to mitigate the worst effects.This year, I’ve taken train journeys across Italy, an overnight long-haul flight to Sri Lanka, and mini buses through the hairpin roads of the Alps. Along the way I’ve tried and tested plenty of products. These are the travel beauty saviours that have kept me feeling my best, many of which I wouldn’t go on a trip without.Beauty hacks for long journeysKeep hydratedView image in fullscreenLarq bottle filtered flip top, 500ml£49.50 at Larq£39.95 at AmazonDehydration can exacerbate skin dryness and dullness after travel, so keep on track by drinking the recommendedsix to eight cups of fluid a day. Larq’s sleek smart-tech water bottle has a filtration system that removes heavy metals, chlorine and other particulates to improve the taste of tap water on the go. It comes on a carabiner so you can pop it on a backpack when you need to be hands-free.For more, read our guide tothe best water bottles tried and testedCalm your nervesView image in fullscreenRoss J Barr Calm patches£15 for 10 at Selfridges£15 for 10 at Victoria HealthIf, like me, travelling makes you feel a little antsy or fatigued, you may find these herb-infused aromatherapy patches help you feel more at ease. I pop them on the temples or wherever I’m seeking relief – they have a soothing effect and can be used for many things, from headaches to tension and even brain fog. Pat them on to skin for a couple of minutes to allow them to work. These include chuanxiong for a calming effect, safflower to reduce inflammation and asarum for aches and pains.Multitasking skin sprayView image in fullscreenClinisoothe+ skin purifier, 100ml£14.95 at Sephora£14.20 at AmazonIf you’ve not heard of hypochlorous acid, then it’s time to get familiar.Beautyinsiders swear by its effectiveness at calming and cleansing skin. It has a skin-neutral pH, so it’s gentle on sensitive and acne-prone complexions. Clinisoothe is a multitasking skin spray with a high purity of hypochlorous – and for me, it’s a must-have when travelling. Spritz it on your face – keep your eyes closed – or body whenever skin feels tight, irritated, or in need of a cleanse. I also use it on surfaces in my vicinity when on a long-haul journey. Don’t let the word acid scare you: hypochlorous acid is naturally produced by the body as an antimicrobial with healing function.Hydration for the eyesView image in fullscreenPeep Club instant relief eye spray, 17ml£15 at Peep Club£15 at AmazonIf you suffer from dry eyes like me, Peep Club’s gentle spray provides instant relief for dry and itchy eyes. A single spray on closed lids hydrates and comforts not just theeyes, but the delicate eyelid and undereye area too. It contains colourless sea buckthorn oil to help soften skin and lock in moisture.A nice smell to escape any bad onesView image in fullscreenDiem Quiet Riot eau de parfum£25 for 10ml plus case at DiemYou can’t control the smells around you, especially on public transport, but you can control your own. I like to pack a mini perfume to transport myself somewhere sweeter-smelling at a moment’s notice. Diem’s reusable twist-to-release case and 10ml minis are ideal for travel, and are eau de parfums, so they’re longer lasting than diluted eau de toilettes. I love Quiet Riot: it has fresh matcha and basil leaf notes, and the magnolia and osmanthus are comforting and calming.For more, read our guide to thebest travel minisAn app to help with jet lagView image in fullscreenTimeshifter app£9.99 per plan or £21.99 a year at TimeshifterIf you’re changing time zone on your trip, then several things can help minimise the jet lag: light exposure, altering your bedtime and wake-up alarm and controlling caffeine intake. This app has been a saviour for me on long-haul trips as it does all the hard work for you, suggesting new timings for your routine once you input your flight details.Lightweight glasses for long journeysView image in fullscreenJimmy Fairly Elvie framesFrom £135 at Jimmy FairlyFor comfort and hygiene, contact lenses are best swapped for glasses during travel, especially in aeroplane cabins where low humidity can dry out eyes. Larger frames can feel cumbersome when worn for long periods, so I like Jimmy Fairly’s petite, Miu Miu-style Elvie ones as they’re lightweight and comfy.Drink greens on the goView image in fullscreenWelleCo the Super Elixir mini£2 at WelleCoHigh-sodium travel snacks can leave you feeling sluggish, bloated and dehydrated – not helped by sitting still for hours. So, when packing fresh food isn’t an option, I pop a greens powder in my water bottle to add antioxidants and fibre to my fluid intake. Elle Macpherson’s WelleCo Super Elixir comes in sachets that are super-handy for travel, and I enjoy the taste much more than many similar products.Antioxidant capsulesView image in fullscreenBeauty Pie Superactive capsules£27 at Beauty PieThese Beauty Pie capsules are filled with serum for a dose of the antioxidants vitamin E and C, whichhelp shield skin from light and pollution damage. Twist the neck of a capsule to release the serum and apply before moisturiser in advance of a long journey. I transfer a bunch to areusable travel potto use on the go.Remove your makeupView image in fullscreenBioderma Sensibio H2O micellar water cleanser for sensitive skin, 100ml£6.49 at Superdrug£6.50 at Look FantasticMakeup can quickly make skin feel tight on planes and trains and is likely to clog pores in such occlusive conditions. I whip it off as soon as I can with micellar water. Bioderma’s is a lovely toning formula that removes every trace when used with a reusable pad, and feels nice and refreshing. It also means you don’t have to splash any water from a sketchy onboard sink on your face.Soothe tired eyesView image in fullscreenSummer Fridays Jet Lag undereye patches£25 for six at Space NK£25 for six at SephoraSummer Fridays’ cult patches are the perfect in-flight treat for tired eyes. They’re filled with ingredients to soothe the delicate eye area, from hydrating glycerine to calming panthenol and niacinamide, as well as caffeine to reduce puffiness. I wear them for about 20 minutes on clean skin, then follow up with moisturiser and SPF so I’m ready for arrival.The best eye creams: 10 favourites for banishing bags, puffiness and fine lines – testedRead moreA handbag-sized moisturiserView image in fullscreenAlpha-HHighTide water cream, 15ml£15.99 at Cosmetify£15.99 at Face the FuturePack a light, quenching moisturiser such as this water cream in your handbag to apply before and during your long journey.

So a broad-spectrum SPF is a must, even if you’re inside. Ultra Violette’s new formula is light and won’t clog pores, plus it feels smooth to apply.For more, read Sali Hughes’s guide tothe best sunscreensSkin barrier protectionView image in fullscreenSunsolve MD Detox + Shield SPF50, 48ml£77 at LibertySunsolve MD’s Detox + Shield SPF50 is designed to protect the skin from environmental stressors, with a mineral formula (meaning it creates a physical barrier on the skin) that still feels lightweight. It also promises to strengthen the skin’s protective barrier over time, so if you have sensitive skin and are hopping between cities, it could be worth the hefty price.Block out stressful noiseView image in fullscreenLoop earplugs Quiet 2£19.95 at Loop Earplugs£19.95 at AmazonI’m sensitive to noise and swear by Loop’s reusable silicone earplugs to keep me feeling calm in loud spaces, or to help me switch off when it’s time to sleep. They’re easy to clean and come in a travel case.A lip mask for long journeysView image in fullscreenDrunk ElephantPlump-C tripeptide lippe mask, 15ml£26 at Sephora£26 at Cult BeautyThe sensitive skin on lips can feel particularly parched while travelling, so patting on a lip mask during a long journey, or the night after, can help keep them juicy. This new Drunk Elephant launch is a treatment version of its popular balm, restoring hydration and softness with marula oil and shea butter. It also has a plumping effect, if that’s your bag.For more, read our guide tothe best lip balms tried and testedA luxury travel pillowView image in fullscreenSlip Jet Setter striped silk travel pillow£120 at Selfridges£120 at SephoraSpending hours lying on a synthetic pillow can leave skin feeling itchy or aggravated – especially when you’re in close, occlusive conditions. Slip’s silk travel pillow feels like the ultimate luxury, and is much more comfy than plane handouts.Treat your skinView image in fullscreenBeauty of Joseon centella asiatica calming mask£5 each at Superdrug£6 for three at Look FantasticApplying a sheet mask is a great way to treat skin during transit, even if you get a few funny looks. K-beauty favourite Beauty of Joseon’s soothing centella asiatica mask is made with three types of hyaluronic acid for intense hydration and won’t stress sensitive skin. Apply on a cleansed face or on top of a serum, wear for about 20 minutes and massage the remaining product into the face and neck.Massage your faceView image in fullscreenFaceGym Face Coach Q10 face oil, 30ml£56 at Look Fantastic£56 at SelfridgesView image in fullscreenFaceGym multi-sculpt high-performance contouring tool£50 at Cult Beauty£53 at Look FantasticIf you’re prone to puffiness when travelling, try massaging your face with (clean!) knuckles gently from the neck up, using a serum or oil. I like FaceGym’s Face Coach oil for this – and even better, use the brand’s gua sha for the massage to aid lymphatic drainage. It’s stainless steel, so it will also cool and calm skin.A toothbrush great for travelView image in fullscreenSuri electric toothbrushFrom £63.75 at Suri£63.75 at HealfFor overnight journeys and travel in general, this is hands down my favourite electric toothbrush. Made from sleek aluminium, it’s much lighter than other models and can be bought with a UV light charging case that neutralises bacteria. The battery lasts for up to 40 days, too.For more, read our guide tothe best electric toothbrushes tried and testedMoisture for frazzled hairView image in fullscreenSam McKnight Happy Endings nourishing balm mini, 30ml£22 at Sam McKnight£22 at Cult BeautyThe low humidity on trains and planes can dry out hair as well as skin. So, for when ends start to feel frazzled, or if you want to give locks a zhoosh before you land, pack Sam McKnight’s multitasking Happy Endings balm. It’s one of my hair care ride or dies: it instantly nourishes and smoothes, and can also be used to define layers, but it’s not heavy or greasy.A post-travel breath freshenerView image in fullscreenSelahatin Blue Forever eau d’extrait oral, 18.5ml£36 at Niche BeautyIf you need a quick breath freshen-up, this Selahatin spray looks and tastes luxurious. It contains liquorice, which has antibacterial benefits, as well as refreshing citrus and peppermint.Hayley Spencer is a journalist and editor with 15 years’ experience of writing on topics spanning style, beauty and wellnessExplore more on these topicsSkincareThe FilterBeautyWomen's hairHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But he knew for sure they would be a big hindrance as soon asDonald Trumpannounced late last month that he was slapping a 15% levy on all goods from the European Union.“The first email I received was from my cork provider,” Burke recalled. “He said he’d take on 2% of the additional cost of importing corks from Europe, but I would have to absorb the other 13%. Then my barrel supplier got in touch, pushing me to put in my orders as fast as possible because every new French barrel coming across the Atlantic after the tariffs was going to come with a $100 or $150 fee.”Every one of these messages was a gut punch for Burke’s five-year-old family-run business, Dresser Winery, which sits on an idyllic hillside outside Paso Robles and specializes in big, bold reds. Burke sent a note out to his wine club members earlier this year telling them he did not plan on increasing prices for the fall shipment, but he realized he could no longer honor the commitment.“If we do that,” he said flatly, “we have to shut the business down.”It turns out even US wine producers are heavily reliant on foreign components – everything from French oak barrels, which give the wine a buttery, vanilla finish in contrast to the much less appealing brown sugar taste of American oak, to glass bottles and corks and the wine-making equipment itself.“Every single product we use, from our pumps to the de-stemmer, comes with instructions written in six languages,” Burke explained. “Could we produce some of these things here? Sure, but it would take three years to get production up and running, and that’s not the way the specialization has been.”As another producer from Paso Robles, Paul Hoover of Still Waters Vineyards, put it: “The only thing in my bottles made in America is the wine.”Ostensibly, Trump’s tariffs on imported goods are supposed to give a competitive boost to American entrepreneurs like Burke and Hoover. But the theory does not really apply to the wine business – not only because so many of the materials used to makeCaliforniawine come from overseas, but also because people do not buy wine based on price alone.“It is a fundamental misunderstanding of wine drinkers and the wine marketplace,” the National Association of Wine Retailers, an industry lobby group, said in ablistering statementin response to the 15% tariff announcement.View image in fullscreen‘When an American wine drinker asks for red Burgundy, they do not substitute Oregon pinot noir when the Burgundy is out of their price range or unavailable. They simply don’t make a purchase.’Photograph: Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images“Champagne is not sparkling wine. Bordeaux is not simply cabernet sauvignon or merlot … America’s independent fine wine retailers understand better than most that when an American wine drinker asks for red Burgundy, they do not substitute Oregon pinot noir when the Burgundy is out of their price range or unavailable. They simply don’t make a purchase.”Burke echoed this sentiment, saying he had to control his reaction recently when a Trump supporter came to his winery and told him he must be excited about the business opportunities the tariffs will create. “People aren’t buying my bottles because of tariffs on French wines, that’s for sure,” he said. “If anything, I’m competing against other Californian and American wines. With European wines, it’s not a real competition at all. They’re very different regions, very different products.”California wines are far from the cheapest because of the high cost of land and labour in the Golden state. For that reason, many producers live or die by the quality of what they make and the sort of subtle distinctions that come from varietals grown in a particular microclimate, or in a particular soil, or aged in a particular barrel.Price still matters, because fine wines are a discretionary spending item, and if the economy or people’s personal finances are struggling it is often one of the first things that consumers stop buying. The National Association of Wine Retailers, said it was worried about tariffs generally, not just on wine, because inflation and an uncertain business climate would hurt its members’ bottom line just as much.“The increased costs of living that will result from the recently enacted tariffs, along with the significant increase in prices for wines … will only push down consumption further, thereby harming the American wine industry to a degree from which many of its participants will not recover,” the group said.In Paso Robles, which has seen an explosion in the number of wineries over the past two decades to about 250 and has become a major weekend tourist hub for wine lovers from San Francisco and Los Angeles, some of the harmful effects are being felt already.Joel Peterson, executive director of the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance, said international orders were drying up as the reverberations from Trump’s trade war echo around the globe. “We have wine sitting in a warehouse that is specially labeled for the Canadian market that producers can’t sell,” he said. “We’ve had no orders from the UK since Trump’s so-called Liberation Day in April. People are scared to order those wines.”Domestic retailers say they have not seen significant price increases kick in yet – for either domestic or European wines – but are already starting to struggle simply because of the uncertainty created by the White House’s constantly shifting messages on where and at what rate it intends to impose tariffs.“We’re not in a recession but it’s what I call a recess market,” said Jim Knight, co-owner of the Wine House in Los Angeles, which specializes in small-label boutique wines from the United States and around the world. “People have money, they’re just not spending it … If the president made a decision and stuck with it, we could plan for it. But we haven’t been able to plan for it.”Knight’s business has a particular problem with high-end French wines it bought in advance years ago – right after the grapes were harvested – and presold to customers with an anticipated 10% mark-up. When tariffs on European wines were briefly at 10% earlier this year, Knight was looking at his entire profit being wiped out, since tariffs are imposed when goods arrive in the United States, not when they are purchased. Now, at 15%, he’s looking at taking a loss that might force him to lay off workers or otherwise shrink his business.For now, he is letting the wine sit in a temperature-controlled storage unit in France and hoping Trump might still bend to pressure from the industry to create a tariff exception for wines and spirits. An industry initiative calledToasts not Tariffshas been lobbying the White House hard to do exactly that.More broadly, Knight said he was worried that small European producers would no longer offer their limited production to the US market, and that some of the specialist importers, the ones who love the same smaller label wines he does, will go out of business. “Importers of wine from the European Union are American businesses too,” he remarked.That helps explain why a US distributor of European wines and spirits,VOS Selectionsof New York, has been the lead plaintiff in alawsuitchallenging the constitutionality of Trump’s tariffs – a case that led to an initial ruling against the administration in the court of international trade at the end of May.Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University who has spearheaded the suit, said the nature of the wine business was a vivid illustration of the harm that tariffs can do. “Many of the wines our client imports simply cannot be produced in the United States because of differences in climate, soil and other factors,” he said. “We’re not benefiting American industry, we’re damaging it and hurting consumers.”Not every wine producer sees the economic outlook as uniformly gloomy. Hoover, of Still Waters Vineyards, said the cost of storing and transporting wine was a greater burden than the price of corks or bottles – particularly for California producers who have too much inventory on their hands following a post-Covid boom-and-bust cycle. He said he was relieved at adrop in fuel pricesin recent months and saw opportunities if they fell further.He was modestly hopeful, for example, that he could tap into sales opportunities on the east coast where he was previously priced out. “Before the tariffs, a boat coming from Europe could deliver wine to the east coast more efficiently than I could getting it across the United States on a truck,” he said. “Let’s see how that looks going forward. Energy costs are the key to this. Let’s hope the tariffs don’t monkey that up.”One of the main reasons that people in the wine business do not believe the tariffs will benefit domestic producers, as the White House is promising, is that they have seen this scenario play out before, during Trump’s first term as president.In 2019, the administration imposed a25% tariffon most European wines, among other products, in retaliation for European subsidies on Airbus passenger jets. Trump said at the time that the relatively low price of French wines was unfair to California producers, but no evidence emerged that the tariff did anything to redress that perceived unfairness. “It did not increase my domestic wine sales at all,” Knight said.Explore more on these topicsWineWest CoastCaliforniaTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Customise this one by swapping the almonds for pistachios, and serving it with cherries or other seasonal fruit. Do seek out the anise seeds, though, because they add such a lovely pop of flavour. The praline can be made up to a week ahead and stored in an airtight container in the freezer, while the semifreddo itself will keep happily in the freezer for about a week.Honey and almond semifreddo with nectarinesPrep5 minCook1 hr 15 minFreezeOvernightServes8For the praline90g sugar70g whole roasted almondsPinch of sea saltFor the semifreddo5 egg yolks20g runny honey80g caster sugar2 egg whites300ml double cream1 tsp anise seeds, lightly toasted and crushed in a mortarFor the nectarines2 tsp caster sugar2 tsp lemon juice2 tsp runny honeyA pinch of salt4 ripe nectarines1 sprigfresh basil or mint, leaves roughly tornLine a baking tray with greaseproof paper and set aside. To make the praline, put the sugar and 30ml water in a small saucepan and set it over a low heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then turn up the heat to medium-high and cook, without stirring but swirling the pan occasionally, until the mix turns a deep golden colour. Stir in the almonds, then pour on to the lined tray, sprinkle with sea salt and leave to cool and harden. Once hardened, break up the praline, then pulse in a food processor (or bash with a rolling pin) to break down into small, irregular pieces no larger than 1cm. Store in an airtight container in the freezer until needed.Line the base and sides of a 10cm x 20cm loaf tin with greaseproof paper, leaving a generous overhang to help you lift the semifreddo out later. Fill a medium saucepan a third of the way up with water and bring to a simmer. In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks, honey and 40g sugar, then set the bowl over the pan, ensuring the base isn’t touching the water. Whisk for six to eight minutes, until thick and pale, then take off the heat and whisk (ideally over a bowl of ice) until cooled.Put the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer and whisk until white and foamy. Gradually beat in the remaining 40g sugar, whisking until it dissolves and the mix comes to firm peaks. Scrape the meringue into the egg yolk bowl, but don’t mix it in just yet.In the same bowl and with the same whisk attachment (no need to wash them), whip the cream to soft peaks. Scrape this into the yolk bowl, too, then add the anise seeds and praline, and fold until just combined. Scrape the mixture into the lined tin, smooth the top and freeze overnight (or for up to a week).About 30 minutes before serving, prepare the nectarines. In a medium bowl, whisk the sugar, lemon juice, honey and salt. Halve and stone the nectarines, then cut them into 1cm wedges. Toss with the syrup and herbs, then leave to macerate.To serve, lift the semifreddo out of its tin using the overhang, then cut into roughly 2½cm-thick slices. Arrange on plates, spoon the nectarines on top and serve at once.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotIce-cream and sorbetDessertFruitSummer food and drinkEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"

What’s more, I haven’t dated anyone. This isn’t a question of labels – I have objectively not seen anyone for 10 years.I’m a straight man and I have felt quite a bit of shame about not dating and not seeing anyone, and I have lied about my circumstances to family and friends. “Oh, yeah, I’ve been on dates,” and “Oh, yeah, I have a sex life,” are some of the lies I have repeated.I have more or less gotten over the reasons why I might have isolated myself emotionally from other people. I no longer tell myself that I am unlikable/unlovable, and am open to the idea that other people could be attracted to me. But, I can’t fathom how to meet anyone. I can’t read anyone’s body language, and feel flirt-illiterate.

How can I be ‘quietly intelligent’? | Leading questionsRead moreEleanor says:There’s plenty of advice on how to get “a date” or “a girlfriend”, as though they’re a uniform species. Like catching “a trout”. Some such advice is fine (be punctual, don’t expect mind reading), but I’d be wary of treating dating as a uniform activity – one big sport where everyone but you knows the rules. Dating’s different for everyone. Just like the friendships between high school girlfriends have different norms and origins from the friendships between golf buddies, your dating life will look particular to you. Figuring it out isn’t about figuring out how to “date”per se.It’s about figuring out how to be yourself enough that the people who are looking for you can find you.With that in mind, here are some generalisations that should be treated as exactly that.Go where your people are likely to be“People” are everywhere, but you’re not just trying to meet people, you’re trying to meetyourpeople. Go where they’re likely to be – joint activities, hobbies, shared friend groups. Expanding your romantic life often involves just expanding your social life: making sure you’re out, known, in the habit of chatting to people you don’t know.Flirting is not about getting laidIt might help to think of flirting as an extension of social bonding rather than a strategy unique to dating. It’s just creating chemistry. Do you make people feel like the most interesting thing in the room? Do you hold eye contact a smidge longer in a way that suggests they’re fascinating? Does it seem as though there’s some mischief that you’re in on together? When figuring out whether people are flirting with you, it’s the same thing in reverse. If someone is trying to build some chemistry, they will find reasons to share things with you.Check the baggageA lot of philosophers worry that our closest relationships often start in a bit of deception: we act like our best selves in early romance. In fact, I think this is for good reason. You don’t want to make your neurosis or baggage the other person’s responsibility at first. In your case, you’ve felt unlovable in the past and you worry about your inexperience. But I don’t think it’s dishonest not to disclose this. The risk of sharing these things is they could become symbols for both of you – a date can’t just be a date, a rejection can’t just be a rejection. It becomes a symbol of your worth or romantic viability. That’s a lot to put out there in the early stages of getting to know someone – for them and for you. It’s important to have your own ways of dealing with the fears and vulnerabilities dating can bring up. Since you have learned ways to manage your negative self-talk, it sounds as though you’re well on the way. Let yourself be seen for you, not for your fears and woes.I love dance so much. How do I decide if I want it as a career or just a hobby? | Leading questionsRead moreAnd when in doubt, you can just ask. You mentioned finding it hard to read body language, feeling “flirt illiterate”. Partly this is by design. A lot of flirting deliberately retains its plausible deniability. That being said, if your challenges reading social cues are general, not dating-specific, it may be worth coming up with direct and friendly ways to clarify: “I’m not always sure if I’ve read the vibe right, but would you like to get a drink or dinner together?” Some people will feel liberated if you give them permission to say exactly what they mean.I know this stuff feels like an impossible world to break into, but believe me that dating is just an extension of the social interactions you’re used to.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Princess Polly, available on Asos in the UK, has a lot in common with other ultra-fast fashion brands. Although a little more expensive than Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing, the Australian-American multinational offers the same kind of trend-driven, low-priced clothes, mostly made from polyester. At the time of writing, shoppers can peruse more than 2,000 dresses, from a £6 pink mini dress to an £82 cream maxidress. There are bikini bottoms for £3 and barrel-leg jeans from £8. But there is one key difference between Princess Polly and its competitors. In early July, it became B Corp certified, bringing the certification’s integrity into question.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.B Corp is the world’s most recognisable corporate responsibility certification and, since its inception in 2006, has been awarded to businesses that meet its “high standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency,” including Patagonia, the Body Shop and the Guardian. The B stands for “beneficial”.The B Corp label has long symbolised a business dedicated to caring for people and planet. Through a rigorous, months- or even years-long verification process, it is intended to hold companies to high standards by measuring positive impact on workers, community, environment and customers. However, at the time of writing, Princess Polly is running a buy-one-get-one-60%-off promotion, pushing excess product in a way that doesn’t seem to align with B Corp values.View image in fullscreenCheap at half the price ... £8 barrel-leg jeans by Princess Polly.Photograph: Princess PollyDale McCarthy, whose carbon-neutral certified swimwear label Bondi Born was awarded B Corp status in 2020, says the news left her “deeply disappointed ... It makes a mockery of it.” “[Now] it seems any company can get certified if they issue enough policies and tick enough boxes, even if the fundamentals of the business are a major contributor to environmental damage,” she says.Another B Corp fashion brand, New Zealand designer Kowtow, takes issue with Princess Polly’s business model, which relies on producing vast volumes of clothing. “It contributes to a hyperconsumerist culture,” says its managing director, Emma Wallace. “The root [problem] of overproduction … needs to be addressed.” A newreport from the Apparel Impact Institute(pdf) attributes the apparel industry’s 7% emissions increase to ultra-fast fashion, overproduction and a reliance on virgin polyester.On its website, Princess Polly says: “We’re on a mission to make on-trend fashion sustainable”, and notes it has introduced a range of measures, including using “lower-impact materials” such as recycled polyester and organic cotton in 30% of its “new arrivals”.View image in fullscreen‘Deeply disappointed’ … Bondi Born, whose founder, Dale McCarthy, is critical of Princess Polly’s certification.Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/EPASustainability campaigners and industry observers voice scepticism. “It’s greenwashing,” says Alden Wicker, the founder of theSubstack EcoCult, which reports on sustainability issues in the industry. “You can’t run a certification like this based on vibes. Anybody who wants a better world when it comes to how we purchase and consume fashion would have values that clash with the ethos of this brand.”B Corp has found itself on shaky ground recently, not just because of Princess Polly. In February, after the certification of several companies not usually associated with good environmental practice, the famously ethically minded soap company Dr Bronner’s dropped the certification,stating: “Sharing the same logo and messaging … [with] companies with a history of serious ecological and labour issues, and no comprehensive or credible eco-social certification of supply chains, is unacceptable to us”.David Bronner, the company’s CEO, is unimpressed with the certification of Princess Polly. “It’s just single-use plastic. You could be doing all kinds of good stuff, but if that’s your product offering, then that’s inherently not better for the world.”Princess Polly says it’s “proud of its environmental, social and governance progress”, and highlights that its focus is on two areas: ethical sourcing (100% of its mostly Chinese garment manufacturers have a “valid ethical manufacturing audit”) and environmental impact (it has pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 2030). But its circularity initiatives are scant (you can read its policy here) and it only hasa vague commitmentto paying living wages.In a statement provided in response to specific questions about Princess Polly’s certification, B Lab, the business behind B Corp, wrote: “B Corp certification is holistic; it doesn’t evaluate a product or service, nor is it exclusively focused on a single social or environmental issue.”With about 10,000 companies certified, now including various well-known multinationals, B Lab says the movement is “intentionally diverse”. But to some, this broad-church approach reveals another shortcoming. “If your theory of change is engaging big and questionable players and helping them be marginally better, you need to distinguish companies that are going way beyond that,” says Bronner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The minimum score for certification is 80 points but critics point out a business can be weak in one area and make up for it in another. Businesses must reapply for certification after three, and then five, years. At least some of the contention is with using a points-based system that brands can leverage by hiring consultants able to help them navigate the application process. In other words, says McCarthy: “large companies can afford teams of lawyers and document writers”, which are resources less likely to be available to smaller businesses.View image in fullscreenPaying attention … sustainable fashion designer and advocate Amy Powney.Photograph: Trish WardChange is coming. After a five-year consultation process, the certification is due to be updated next year. Under B Lab’s new standards, companies will need to meet minimum requirements across seven areas including: climate action, environmental stewardship and circularity.Since 2024,the sustainable fashion designer and activist Amy Powneyhas been pursuing B Corp certification for her new label, Akyn. She says the new B Corp standards are more onerous for circularity, waste, overproduction and human rights, so “it will be interesting to see if [Princess Polly] pass in three years”.As for the ongoing desirability of the B Corp label and its ability to signal brand value to conscious consumers, the jury remains out. Powney will still apply and at Kowtow the certification remains useful. “It has empowered our team to work on the tough stuff, ask questions of our suppliers and collaborate on solutions,” says Wallace.For Bronner, who won’t be returning, the new standards are “directionally getting better but still failing in certain fundamental ways”. Bondi Born’s McCarthy remains sceptical: “I’ll wait and see whether B Corp as a brand continues to dilute itself until it’s meaningless – or not.”To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletterSustainable fashionFashion industryEthical businessCorporate governancenewslettersShareReuse this content"

We started in Lake Bled. Teens loved the Dolinka ziplines, the summer toboggan run, hiking in Vintgar gorge and swimming in Lake Bled. You can hire paddleboards and boats. If you have the money, there is rafting and canyoning too. After seeing the incredible Postojna cave, we went up the Vogel cable by Lake Bohinj. Half-board at theBohinj Eco hotelkept the teens amply fed and it also has an aquapark, bowling and plenty of games to boot. We finished the trip off with shopping in Ljubljana and the best ice-cream ever at Romantika.

We have been twice with our teens, and sent friends too! A mile-long beach where teenagers can roam and paddleboard, an easy train journey to explore Rome, lunchtime pizza slices with locals cheering on the footie at L’Angolo delle Crepes. Plus the opportunity to sleep in a castle at hostel prices. Fluffy white towels aplenty, but also a gleaming kitchen if you want to cook. Don’t miss the nearby necropolis for an Indiana Jones-style adventure. Fireworks over the castle and a hilarious Italian Beatles cover band were theciliegina sulla torta!MargaretDracula and bear-spotting in RomaniaView image in fullscreenBrown bears cross a road in Romania.Photograph: Heckepics/Getty ImagesThe best European trip with my teen (so far) has to be Romania. We stayed in Brașov, booked an apartment with a pool and had the best time. There is so much to do and lots of easy public transport. We ate outdoors at little cafes on the street, took a cable car up the mountain, went on a trip to see bears in the forest (up close and personal!), had a tree-top adventure at Adventure Park and visited Dracula’s castle. The town itself is historic and beautiful, and the people are so welcoming. It’s not your typical British tourist destination but it makes for a fabulous adventure.KateWhen in Rome … take a Vespa tour!View image in fullscreenVespas in Rome.Photograph: Loop Images Ltd/AlamyRome in October half-term. Coliseum and Forum tours gave the right balance of interesting history, fun facts and a bit of gore that most teenagers would be entranced by! Walked a lot without seeming to walk a lot. A two-hour Vespa tour was the highlight. You hang on to the drivers and they negotiate the traffic, show you a different Rome with local knowledge and attitude. To complete the adventure: guaranteed great food, gelato and, for weary parents of an evening, vino cheapo!RuthAustria’s Alpine summer wonderlandView image in fullscreenA waterpark in Saalbach-Hinterglemm.Photograph: Josef Kubes/AlamySaalbach-Hinterglemm in Austria in the summer meant hiking, ebiking and waterparks. Take advantage of the Joker card for free or reduced-price access to lots of activities.

Plenty to keep teens entertained.HilaryAn epic train journey across EuropeView image in fullscreenThe Deyrolle taxidermy shop in Paris.Photograph: Only France/AlamyLast summer I went with my two children on a trip north through Scandinavia, then back via the Baltic countries. This turned into an epic 5,000-mile train journey, which we each took part in planning. The 10-year-old’s focus was on cycling, swimming, play parks and cat cafes. The 14-year-old took us to the KGB headquarters in Riga, a tour around Berlin, and a visit to the Deyrolle taxidermy shop in Paris. By handing over some planning and responsibility to the kids, I could relax; they were engaged in activities away from their devices and their geography knowledge improved!Sarah PatelCosmopolitan and exotic AntwerpView image in fullscreenThe cafe at MoMu.Photograph: Stany Dederen/Matthias De BoeckAntwerp by Eurostar was perfect.

He’s the age where we can enjoy both Disneyland and then take in the Hockney retrospective at the stunning Fondation Louis Vuitton. Back at base we watched city life unfold from our French windows and then sampled Lebanese, Laos and French meals in the bustling streets around. Nearer to town, the family-run Eats Thyme is a standout.GingerGigoloWinning tip: Oompah and cable cars in BavariaView image in fullscreenA terrace on the summit of the Germany’s highest mountain, Zugspitze.Photograph: Mauritius Images /AlamyA two-centre holiday to Munich and Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Bavaria, Germany, is a must with teenagers as there is so much to see and do. In Munich they loved the atmosphere in the beer halls – eating pretzels and listening to the oompah band and watching the Rathaus-Glockenspiel in the square. A visit to the Olympiapark is also recommended. In Garmisch-Partenkirchen there is a toboggan run, which is great fun, and nearby is the beautiful Zugspitze mountain and cable car, with boating on Eibsee lake. Bavaria has plenty to keep teenagers entertained and active, for a very enjoyable holiday.Richard WatkinsView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsFamily holidaysReaders' travel tipsEurope holidaysTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.One of the things that makes gardening so perpetually, addictively interesting to me is how it challenges beliefs I’d previously held about myself – often on an annual basis. Some beliefs are big, others are smaller, such as my dislike of asters.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Ask me in the middle of spring, when everything is new and fresh, and the tulip petals look as if they’ve been streaked with a fan-shaped brush, and I will confidently say I’m not an aster fan. Too fussy, too much lilac, too bushy. But scoot forward six months, and I regret I hadn’t planted a few in the gaps that appear at this time of year.For the uninitiated, asters – also known as Michaelmas daisies because they are often in flower in late September – are a large group of several species of shrubby daisies.They are unfussy to grow, will put up with part shade or full sun, and aren’t particularly needy, as long as they’re not subjected to drought or boggy conditions. In short, there’s probably somewhere in your growing space that could accommodate one where there isn’t anything else growing for the next few months. I’ve been prompted to think about asters because we’ve just moved into a house with a blank slate of a back garden, and the promise of a good, dry garden out the front. The number of ornamental plants growing across both could be counted on one hand, and the bog-standard pale purple (a colour that always reminds me of Tammy Girl circa 1998, iykyk) aster is among them.If you wanted something more keenly purple, ‘Violetta’ is real wizard’s-robe territoryIf you’re starting a garden from scratch, with not much money, addressing whether you can accept what’s currently happy there is a fair basis for a contented relationship. I’m beginning to think I will welcome them not only into the front garden, but also into the back, where my dreams ofPiet Oudolf-style clouds of dew-dropped asters will shiver into future autumns.Oudolf – the Dutch garden designer whose clumps of naturalistic planting have inspired more contemporary gardens than most – deployedA. umbellatusin the Oudolf Field atHauser & Wirthart centre in Bruton, Somerset. It’s white, which makes it a great palette-cleanser for the bolder, warmer tones of late-summer and autumn planting, and pleasingly tall.I’m also eyeing upA. pyrenaeus‘Lutetia’, a favourite ofBeth Chatto’s, which has large, spidery flowers in the palest lilac. If you wanted something more keenly purple, check outSymphyotrichum novi-belgii‘Violetta’, which is real wizard’s-robe territory.Some will flower long into the autumn, and then offer up graceful skeletons for catching frost. In spring, cut them back, remind yourself you once said you didn’t like asters, and be grateful you’ve changed your ways.Explore more on these topicsGardensGardening advicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

La Paz, featuring the clock that runs backwards.Photograph: Andrew Sutherland/AlamyAfter years of prosperity driven by a natural gas boom, reserves dwindled during the final years of Morales’s presidency, triggering an economic crisis that has deepened ever since.“The gas that should have sustained the country for much longer – and then generated resources to be invested in other sectors, diversifying the economy – wasn’t used that way,” said Alvarez.Under Arce, the economy has deteriorated further: by July 2025,annual inflation had reached 24.8%, the highest level since at least 2008. Just as Bolivia celebrates 200 years of independence, there areshortages of fuel and US dollars, leading to scarcities andlong queues even for bread.Deadly clashes over Morales candidacy deepen Bolivia crisis in election run-upRead more“Everything is more expensive, and we’re barely getting by,” said Quispe, who previously voted for Mas but now plans to vote for Medina because “the left just isn’t working any more”.Leticia Guarachi Padilla, a 35-year-old leftist entrepreneur who runs a small business installing blinds and curtains, plans to spoil her ballot in protest over Morales’s exclusion from the race.The first Indigenous president in Bolivia’s history and the country’s longest-serving leader, from 2006 to 2019, Morales was barred by the constitutional court, which ruled that he has already exceeded the two-term limit, and the electoral court, which has argued that his party is not formally registered.Since October, he hasremained entrenched in central Bolivia, wherehundreds of coca farmershave prevented police fromexecuting an arrest warrantissued against him over allegations that hefathered a child with a 15-year-old while in office.12:45Tracking down Evo Morales, Bolivia’s fugitive ex-president, in his jungle hideout – videoIn recent weeks, Morales has urged supporters to cast blank votes – claiming that if the number of spoiled ballots exceeds the share won by the top candidate,it would mean he had won.The highest-polling leftwing name is that of Andrónico Rodríguez, a 36-year-old senator, polling third to fifth.Once seen as Morales’s natural heir due to his Indigenous roots and leadership in the coca growers’ union, Rodríguez was labelled a traitor by his former mentor after deciding to launch his own candidacy and has seemed unable to rally support from the fragmented left.“I voted for Evo every time he ran, and I don’t regret it because he promoted structural changes that favoured the poorest,” said Padilla, who acknowledged the former president’s “problems”, including “his relationships with underage girls and the fact that he sees himself as a saviour, driven more by ego”. But she still believes he should have run.“Voting for Doria or Quiroga means voting for imperialism and for the US to retake control of Bolivia,” she said.View image in fullscreenJorge ‘Tuto’ Quiroga Ramírez greets supporters during his closing campaign rally in La Paz on Wednesday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIf no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, or at least 40% with a 10-point lead over the runner-up, a second round will be held on 19 October, which would be unprecedented in the country’s history.Doria Medina and Quiroga are running for the fourth time, but stillpresent themselves as political outsiders. Both advocate spending cuts as their main strategy to tackle the economic crisis.Quiroga says he would prioritise relations with the United States, while Doria Medina has promised to restore the supply of dollars and fuel within 100 days.His campaign slogan is “100 días, carajo” (100 days, dammit), a reference not to the Argentine president Javier Milei’s libertarian rallying cry “Viva la libertad, carajo!” (Long live freedom, dammit!), but to the2005 plane crash Doria Medina survived, after which he said: “Carajo, no me puedo morir” (I can’t die, dammit!).Riding a motorbike decorated with campaign flags, automotive engineer Juan Pablo Rodríguez, 28, attended Doria Medina’s final rally in La Paz on Tuesday with his wife, Michelle López, also 28, and their one-year-old daughter. “Samuel can fix the crisis because he’s a great businessman,” he said.View image in fullscreenA campaign poster for the presidential candidate Samuel Doria Medina in La Paz on Thursday.Photograph: Rodrigo Sura/EPAOne of Bolivia’s wealthiest men, with a fortune in cement, hospitality and fast food, Doria Medina told the Guardian that if elected, he plans to restore the Plaza Murillo clock to its original, clockwise direction: “Rationality will return, at last.” The current clock, he said, symbolised a country “moving backwards”.The clock – with the number 12 still at the top, but with hands turning to the left to count the hours – wasinstalled in 2014 on the initiative of David Choquehuanca, then foreign minister under Morales and now vice-president under Arce.He claimed it was a way to affirm Bolivia’s identity as a “southern nation”, arguing that a southern hemisphere sundial shadow moves left.But physicist Francesco Zaratti, an emeritus professor at the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés, has long argued the clock “makes no scientific sense”, noting that in Bolivia the shadow can sometimes move right.“When we have a new president, I bet it’ll be one of the first things to go, as a symbolic end to Mas’s 20-year cycle in power,” said Zaratti.Grover Quispe Lima, 35, looks at the clock every day as he sells maize to feed the hundreds of pigeons in Plaza Murillo. He has been walloped by the crisis, with maize prices rising from 120 (£13) to 200 (£21) bolivianos in a year.“To me, it’s irrelevant whether the clock moves backwards or forwards – the only thing that matters is that the next president improves our country,” he said.Explore more on these topicsBoliviaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mohammedine said he had been acting “on behalf of the French intelligence service, which mobilised political leaders, civil society actors and military personnel” in Mali. Some reports in Mali have identified Vezilier as a flight officer who waslistedon the French government website Légifrance as a lieutenant colonel as of 2020.There was no immediate word from France, Mali’s former colonial ruler, on Vezilier’s arrest.“The transitional government informs the national public of the arrest of a small group of marginal elements of the Malian armed and security forces for criminal offences aimed at destabilising the institutions of the republic,” Mohammedine said. “The conspiracy has been foiled with the arrests of those involved.”A national television channel broadcast photos of 11 people it said were members of the group that planned the coup, and Mohammedine identified two generals he accused of being part of the plot, which he said had begun on 1 August.One of them, Gen Abass Dembélé, is a former governor of the central Mopti region. He was abruptly dismissed in May, when he demanded an investigation into allegations that the army had killed civilians in the village of Diafarabé.The other, Gen Néma Sagara, was lauded for her role in fighting militants in 2012.Rida Lyammouri, an analyst at the Morocco-based Policy Center for the New South, told Associated Press Mali’s rulers were well aware of discontent among the population and members of the military.“The military leaders are simply not willing to let those grievances build into something more, like a coup, and therefore these arrests seem more of a way to intimidate than a legitimate coup attempt,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have seen this behaviour against journalists, civil society and political leaders, so it’s not surprising to see this against military members.”Mali, along with neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger, has long fought an insurgency by armed militants, including some allied with al-Qaida and Islamic State.After two military coups, the ruling juntaexpelled French troopsin 2022 and turned to Russia for security assistance. But the security situation remains precarious, and attacks by militantshave intensified in recent months.Gen Assimi Goïta was granted another five years in power in June, despite the junta’s earlier promises of a return to civilian rule by March 2024.

As the storm travelled overland, it dumped large amounts of rain across the south of the island, with 440mm recorded in parts of Pingtung County, causing widespread flooding and agricultural damage.Schools, offices and businesses closed as the storm approached, and more than 7,000 people were evacuated from their homes, mainly in mountainous regions, amid fears of flash flooding and landslides.Almost 300,000 homes lost power, shipping routes were suspended, and about 400 flights were cancelled, including domestic trips.Podul then veered north-east across the Taiwan strait and weakened slightly to a severe tropical storm, before making landfall once again in Fujian province,China, in the early hours of Thursday.Despite weaker winds, Podul lashed south-east China with similarly torrential rain – Macau on the south coast recorded 110mm in an hour.Cape Verde experienced similar downpours on Monday after Tropical Storm Erin developed nearby, causing flash flooding on the north-west islands of Santo Antão and São Vicente. The latter received 193mm of rain within five hours, more than 150% of the yearly average.View image in fullscreenFlooding in São Vicente, Cape Verde.Photograph: ReutersAt least nine deaths have been reported, with several people missing and about 1,500 displaced. Erin will pass to the north of the Caribbean over the weekend, and is expected to achieved hurricane status.Meanwhile, as a heatwave grips the Middle East, the Dead Sea and Jordan Valley have particularly suffered in recent days. The region is susceptible to high temperatures because of its low altitude – it is several hundred metres below sea level in places – and temperatures approached 50C (122F) on Wednesday.Unusually high humidity – about 80% at times – has contributed to the sweltering temperatures. As humid air cools more slowly than drier air, overnight cooling has been limited, leading Israel to record its highest overnight minimum on Wednesday, when it reached 38C near Mount Sodom.Temperature records were also set in southern and westernEuropethis week as yet another heatwave swept the continent. Alongside myriad date records, several all-time peaks were hit in southern France on Sunday and Monday, including in the department of Aude (43.4C) and the cities of Angoulême, Bergerac and Bordeaux (42.1C, 42.1C and 41.6C respectively).Also on Monday, it reached record highs in the Croatian cities of Šibenik (39.5C) and Dubrovnik (38.9C).Explore more on these topicsTaiwanWeather trackerHurricanesMiddle East and north AfricaAsia PacificCape VerdeChinaEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

The paintings represent the thoughts, culture, and religion of the Kassena people, literally written on the walls.Tiébélé in southern Burkina Faso is one of only four Burkinabé sites on theUnesco world heritage list. But it is now on the brink of extinction. “Nowadays, it’s easier to build with metal roofs and cement,” says Abdou Anè, a young resident in Tiébélé.For many years, Tiébélé was an unmissable tourist destination in Burkina Faso. But thejihadist violencethat has been rumbling through the country and its neighbours, Mali and Niger, since 2015 is deterring visitors. To reach Tiébélé, for example, a visitor has to cross a bridge known as Nazinon, which was attacked some time ago. Drivers have to keep to 30km/h and it is under heavy military control.The failed coup d’état of 2015 and subsequent unrest has dampened the tourism industry, with numbers declining every year.View image in fullscreenTiébélé in Burkina Faso is famous for its traditional Kassena architecture and intricately painted houses.Photograph: Olympia de Maismont/AFP/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, the threat to the delicate structures from climate change is growing. “To paint the walls, they must be completely dry, but now the rain is unpredictable, and it has already happened that it starts raining while we’re working on restoration,” says Anè. Plastic sheets are not enough to protect the paintings. “Even though we are very proud to be recognised as a world heritage site, we also need help to keep preserving it.”“Sometimes we get rain during periods when we didn’t before. Before, in March or April, we would get one rain known as the ‘mango rain’, but today we can get three to four rains”, says Anè. “There are trees that no longer produce, and it’s with those that we used to build our houses. This worries the population, especially the elderly who remember what the climate used to be like, because it’s a new kind of change. The rain comes abundantly – more than what people expected. It’s a phenomenon people don’t understand. For example, now we are in August and there is no rain. People are really worried. Those who have seen the seasons of the past and compare them to today are worried. Those who were born into this situation don’t understand the change.”In Kassena culture, found only in this region of the world, the women are responsible for painting the houses. For the unique painted lines, they use pigments extracted from laterite stone, clay, basalt, and even cow dung – materials native to the region. To fix the markings to the walls, they boil the fruit of the néré tree, also known as the “flour tree”, to make a varnish that seals the paint. All this knowledge and skill resides in the head of octogenarianKaye Tintama, recognised as a “living human treasure” by Unesco, a living library responsible for passing on the decoration techniques and the meanings behind the walls and shapes of Tiébélé’s houses to new generations.View image in fullscreenThe threat of climate change to the delicate structures is growing.Photograph: Olympia de Maismont/AFP/Getty ImagesThe award-winning architect Francis Kéréhas been inspiredby the way the Kassena have used natural materials to protect themselves from intense heat and heavy rain for hundreds of years. “[The] Kassena passed his architecture to the present, to the future generations, and this method is inspiring for me,” Kéré told the Guardian.The shape of the houses is significant. Round houses such as Ané’s are for unmarried men, but those shaped like a figure of eight are for older women and unmarried daughters, and rectangular houses are for young couples. “They inspired me to use locally available materials to create the habitat, but also the way they create, they involve all the community, which is highly important for me,” says Kéré.Many of the houses feature a small entrance door to prevent animals from coming in, but also to force visitors to kneel, a position of vulnerability that allows inhabitants to neutralise a possible intruder.The rooftops are designed to dry cereals after the harvest. On the walls, reliefs of snakes symbolise the spirits of grandmothers or the cultural guardian spirit of the Kassena people, who appears once a year during which the population must remain silent and avoid music as it passes. It’s a monument under open skies that now coexists with concrete, sheet metal, and iron windows. “It’s very hard to find straw to make the roofs,” explains Ané as he points to the paillote of his house, destroyed by the wind.The men are in charge of building the houses. It takes a month and a mix of earth, straw, and logs to build the structure. “Chemical products have weakened the soil,” explains Ané, lamenting that the houses no longer last like they used to.In this part of the world, the climate crisis is felt in an accelerated way and without the resources to face it. Even though Sahel countries contribute only1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, they are among those suffering the most from its consequences: temperatures have risen 1.5 times faster than the global average. Additionally,80% of Burkina Faso’s populationlives from agriculture and land-based work.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisBurkina FasoHeritageAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

On 7 August, Solomon Islands prime minister Jeremiah Maneletold parliament that no dialogue partnerswould be invited to the annual gathering.Countries outside the Pacific, known as “dialogue partners,” have attended the forum since 1989, to work with Pacific leaders and contribute to discussions around development and regional security. While not an official partner,Taiwanhas attended the meetings as a “development partner” for more than three decades.The decision by Honiara, a close ally of Beijing, has fuelled speculation the move was aimed at keeping Taiwan out of the meeting. It has raised questions over China’s growing sway in Pacific diplomacy and whether regional unity can hold.Caught in the contest between China and the west, the Cook Islands asks where its future liesRead moreTuvalu, along with the Marshall Islands and Palau, are theonly Pacific countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, in what Beijing views as an affront to its One China principle.In an interview with the Guardian, Teo said he would wait to see how other Pacific leaders respond before deciding whether or not to attend the forum next month, expressing “disappointment” at the last-minute exclusion of external countries.“The region does not need these kinds of distractions,” Teo said. “We have far more important issues to focus on, rather than letting ourselves be pressured from outside.”Teo said he had written to Manele outlining concerns around the inconvenient timing of the decision, and his “difficulties supporting the justification” behind the move.“We’ll … see what the rest of the leaders’ response is to the proposal by the Solomons, and then we’ll make our decision,” he said.“I’ll wait for the final decision on this arrangement, and then reconsider my participation,” he said.The annual forum is the main mechanism through which leaders define region-wide policy agendas.Teo added he “won’t be surprised” if China was behind the decision to block partners from the forum, saying the unusual move broke with decades of precedent in the region.“There is no denying that China is trying to extend its footprint in the Pacific, and so is the US,” Teo said.“My own personal view is that we do need their development assistance, but we do not need the competition and conflict overshadowing our development agenda in the Pacific.”View image in fullscreenFeleti Teo.Photograph: Tala Simeti/The GuardianThe Guardian contacted China’s embassy in Honiara for comment.A US state department spokesperson said Washington was “disappointed” by the move to exclude partners, and reaffirmed support for the attendance of all partners, including Taiwan, at the forum.Trump administration asks tiny Pacific nation of Palau to accept migrants deported from USRead more“All [forum] partners, and that includes Taiwan, should be invited to participate … regardless of where it is hosted – just as countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan invite all dialogue partners, including China,” the spokesperson said.Taiwan said it “urges that that existing arrangements be maintained”, adding that its participation at the Pacific meetings would “further strengthen cooperation”.Not all of Taiwan’s Pacific allies have opposed the decision to exlude foreign attenders to the forum.Palau, which will host the forum in 2026, says it “respects and acknowledges” Solomon Islands’ decision to block all foreign attendees, with the office of the president saying it allows members “to focus on the critical intra-regional issues at this year’s forum”.Solomon Islandsswitched diplomatic allegiances from Taiwan to Chinain 2019 and three years later, the countries signed acontroversial security pact. Honiara has also received significant Chinese funding,including a recent $US1m donation to buy 27 cars to transport delegates during the forum.Dr Sarina Theys, senior lecturer in diplomacy and international affairs at the University of the South Pacific, said Solomon Islands’ decision may be an attempt to avoid openly choosing between China and Taiwan.“The only way to do that is then to just not invite anyone,” Theys said.Niuone Eliuta, first secretary at theTuvaluHigh Commission in New Zealand, said he had “no doubt China is behind this decision” to block external partners from the upcoming forum.“This day and age China is very much influencing what’s going on in the Pacific,” Eliuta said, adding that excluding donor partners could mean countries miss out on vital support such as climate funding.“This is a temporary fix, moving development dialogue partners out of the Solomon Islands,” Eliuta said. “I just hope no countries break away from PIF.”Concerns over Beijing’s influence on the Forum are not new. At last year’s meeting in Tonga, segments of the Pacific leader’s communique that referenced Taiwan were altered,a decision many believe to be an outcome of China’s influence. In 2022, two Chinese defence attacheswere ejected from the Forum’s meeting in Suvawhile caught listening to a visual address given by US vice-president Kamala Harris.Explore more on these topicsTuvaluPacific leaders: in their wordsPacific islandsPacific Islands ForumAsia PacificChinaSolomon IslandsnewsShareReuse this content"

It recently announced plans to scrap the tax break for items from all countries later this month.The EU said in February it wouldphase out its exemptionon customs duties for low-value parcels.Founded by theentrepreneur Chris Xu, Shein is headquartered in Singapore and runs most of its operations from China but sells all its goods outside the country and has recently begun manufacturing in other countries including Turkey and Brazil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She will need to juggle the demands of MPs such asNationals senator Matt Canavan and Liberal Andrew Hastiethat she drop the net zero target with the views of her city MPs, who know they could go the way of their former colleagues who lost seats to teal independents.Let alone doing the right thing for the planet.For the NSWCoalition, energy policy has been an area of mostly bipartisan agreement – until now.In 2020, the then energy minister Matt Kean, a Liberal who now chairs the Climate Change Authority, released the energy roadmap that showed how NSW would meet its objective to deliver a 70% cut in emissions by 2035 compared to 2005 levels, and net zero by 2050.It was supported by both sides.But last week the first signs of an unravelling emerged.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailJust before the NSW parliament rose for a long break, the Liberal MP for Goulburn,Wendy Tuckerman, resignedfrom the shadow ministry over her own party’s failure to listen to her concerns about windfarms.Ostensibly, it was over a failure of the leadership to consult on the electricity infrastructure bill, which the government said was urgent.View image in fullscreenNSW energy minister Penny Sharpe.Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAPThe bill gave the energy minister, Penny Sharpe, the power to fast-track investments in synchronous condensers, which are urgently needed for grid stability. According to her office, it did no more than broaden the definition of priority infrastructure to ensure investments in this critical infrastructure by the privately owned electricity distributors could proceed.Whether it did more than that depends on who you ask.The Minns government says it doesn’t alter the planning and consultation process for major infrastructure such as transmission lines.But it was a bridge too far for Tuckerman, whose electorate is part of a renewable energy zone and has seen dozens of projects proposed.“I have had countless calls, emails and comments from community members that feel like they have just been kicked while they are down. They are bearing the brunt of poor planning and … the government’s lack of accountability. They are not being listened to,” she said.“I can no longer in good conscience be a part of a process that sidelines the voices of constituents and regional communities, or which undermines my ability to represent the people that put me here.”There’s no doubt that Tuckerman’s electorate is concerned about the scale of windfarm development – as is the Orana region near Dubbo.But the concerns have been turbocharged and taken to a wider audience by the Daily Telegraph, which has run no fewer than five stories in the space of two weeks about the harm that windfarms were causing farmers in Tuckerman’s electorate.These were then amplified across other News Corp platforms including news.com.au and Sky News, who interviewed the Telegraph journalists about their coverage, and by 2GB.At the same time, the rightwing advocacy group Advance has announced a campaign to kill off “weakling” Liberals who support the net zero climate target.Advance members are being bombarded with emails seeking donations, with the aim to raise $450,000 before the end of August.Most of Advance’s efforts seem focused on the federal Liberals, but the anti-net zero sentiment has reached the NSW Nationals, at least in the grassroots party. At their conference in June in Coffs Harbour, they voted to drop support for net zero.The problem for Speakman is that the climate issue could quickly become a wedge that will be used by the right to further fuel the leadership speculation that is already bubbling.Speakman is undoubtedly under pressure. There’s no immediate appetite to replace him among the dominant moderate faction from which he comes.But there is concern about a lack of cut-through, particularly as a recent Resolve poll in July in the Sydney Morning Herald showed Labor with a commanding primary vote lead over the Coalition of 38% (up five points on the last result in April) to 32% (down four), with the Greens up two to 13%.ThePoll Bludger estimatedthis would imply a two-party Labor lead of at least 57-43, compared with 54.3-45.7 at the March 2023 election.A 5% swing would see the Liberals lose another five seats and condemn them to a further two terms of opposition.“People are starting to worry about saving the furniture,” one Liberal said.Developing Coffs Harbour foreshore will amount to a ‘desecration of the land’, traditional owners sayRead moreThe Kiama byelection on 13 September will be a test for Speakman. If he puts in a good showing, the troops might calm down. But with an election due in March 2027, the window for leadership bloodletting is fast approaching.Both sides were claiming underdog status in the South Coast seat, which was most recently held by the Liberalturned Independent Gareth Ward who resignedafter being convicted of rape. Ward enjoyed enormous personal support even after the charges were laid, so it’s difficult to say whether voters will chose to punish the Liberals or follow the conventional wisdom of byelections and give the government of the day a good kick.In the meantime, the climate wars are simmering again and they’ve reached the doors of Macquarie Street.A NSW parliamentary committee is due to release a report on the renewable energy zones and their impact on rural communities as early as next week. It will provide an opportunity for the opponents of net zero to target more “weakling” Liberals – and it will test out Speakman’s skill in managing a difficult issue for his troops.Explore more on these topicsNew South Wales politicsNew South WalesCoalitionanalysisShareReuse this content"

More than 50 of the affected courses were international study options attached to other degrees. The pause will last until the end of the autumn 2026 semester.The freeze comes as the university pursues $100m in cost cuts. In April, UTS told its staff that 150 academics and 250 operational employees could lose their jobs, or about a tenth of the workforce.Labor MPs urge government to prioritise reform of ‘failed’ job-ready university graduates schemeRead moreThe faculty of society and design took the biggest hit, followed by the faculty of health, while the science, engineering, business, law and transdisciplinary faculties also each saw courses cut and nine majors have been suspended.UTS said in a statement that current students would not be affected and sought to allay fears over job losses.UTS’s vice-chancellor, Andrew Parfitt, told staff in an email on Thursday that the suspensions would not necessarily mean changes to their employment and no decision had been made to permanently cut the courses affected by the freeze.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailBut an academic staff member in the international studies program, who did not want to be named out of fear of repercussions, said: “That’s not how that’s being interpreted by staff.”The staff member added: “If it’s our courses that have been paused … those job cuts will lie within our programs.”Parfitt’s email to staff said courses chosen for suspension had been put forward by their faculties and received low student enrolments. A quarter of the suspended courses had no enrolments but the majority had at least 25 students, a UTS spokesperson said.The international studies staff member said that employees were not only devastated but also confused over the numbers, and argued that some degrees affected, such as those in education and public health, were socially valuable.“UTS is saying that it’s no longer going to train primary or secondary teachers during what’s effectively also a teacher shortage,” the staff member said. “There’s also a deep sadness, if you speak to people, because the way this is being done is kind of framed in corporate speak, [not] the language of what a public university should be doing in Australia.”Some staff felt physically ill and others left work early after learning of the course suspensions, said Dr Sarah Attfield, the UTS branch president for the National Tertiary Education Union.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said in a statement to the Guardian that it was unable to progress with releasing details of its proposed changes as it is still in a Fair Work Commission dispute with the National Tertiary Education Union over the restructure.“We understand that many staff are feeling anxious and are eager to review the details of the change proposal,” a UTS spokesperson said in the statement, adding “we remain hopeful that we will be able to resolve the dispute and release those proposals to staff soon”.UTS is one ofseveral Australian universities that has announced cuts to jobsand courses in the last 12 months as the sector struggles with declining revenue.Documents released under freedom of information laws show UTS has agreed to pay KPMG nearly $5m in fees for advice on the restructure, which has further raised staff ire, according to Dr Hossai Gul, a UTS lecturer.“External consultants are being paid millions to make recommendations about our operations when our own staff [can] identify issues and solve them collaboratively,” she said. “[It] undermines our mission, damages trust, and creates a culture of fear.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian universitiesAustralian educationIndustrial relationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Preparations for the three-day event have been exhaustive and Chalmers works at a pace few people in the ministerial wing can sustain.Armed with a small page of handwritten notes, Chalmers told this column that the process of consulting with hundreds of individuals and organisations about how to turn around the country’s productivity challenges had been more than worthwhile, as 30-odd attenders prepare to take their seats at the cabinet table on Tuesday morning.There’s no doubt new approaches are needed.Can AI deliver economic nirvana? Only if workers can monitor and shape how it’s used | Peter LewisRead moreProductivity has barely grown at all since 2016. The stagnation in theAustralian economyposes a threat to living standards, since working smarter is the long-run driver of securing higher incomes for households.Ken Henry, the former Treasury boss and summit invitee, puts the challenge another way. He calculates Australian workershave lost about $500,000in potential pay rises over the past 25 years because of sclerotic productivity growth.“I see it as three days to help inform three budgets,” Chalmers said, sitting at a conference table in the office previously occupied by Wayne Swan, his former boss and mentor. Family photos and a curated collection of books about politics and history dominate the space.Conscious of messaging and expectations in Canberra and beyond, Chalmers said outcomes from the roundtable would fuel and inform future decisions of the government, helping set a direction for Labor in this term of parliament an others to come. Solutions to emerging problems such as AI and an ageing population are also badly needed.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe event itself has required more than a little productivity already. Treasury received 900 submissions – twice the number of pitches received before Labor’s jobs and skills summit early in the government’s first term. Chalmers has held boardroom talks with business leaders and lobby groups, while ministers have convened more than 40 preparatory meetings of their own, attended by about 700 people. TheProductivityCommission has released a slew of reports to guide the process.Bureaucrats in Chalmers’ department have used AI to organise and structure this massive input of ideas, including the predictable mix of kite flying, influence peddling and ambit claims.On Friday, Chalmers sat down with his state and territory counterparts for the last of these events. Talking up consensus, the group agreed to work towards faster approvals for major infrastructure projects, to cut cumbersome and outdated regulation, to boost competition and build more homes more quickly.Some serious ideas are in the mix, illustrated by an awkwardly timed Treasury leak this week, which showed Labor was preparing to move forward with reforms to clear a backlog of30,000 housing approvals held upby outdated environmental laws, as well as new rules for AI and a pause on changes to the National Construction Code.“There’s been a heap of effort,” Chalmers said. “Working around the clock for four weeks to make sure that people’s voices are heard and that we can shape up a meaningful and useful roundtable.”The meeting has become an organising tool for Labor’s second term, including allowing Chalmers and Albanese to test ideas with voters and the media and rule some out. The prime minister has also stressed the government won’t misjudge its mandate or foist new taxes on the electorate.Overdue ideas already firmly in need of resolution are being attached as well: changes to Howard-era national environmental laws will get a kick along and Anthony Albanesetelegraphed this weekthat road user charging rules for electric vehicles would be thrashed out over the roundtable. Here a phased-in and staged approach is expected, treating heavy vehicles differently to ensure EV take-up continues to grow in line with the renewables transition.Labor might even come away with an idea or two for major reform proposals to take to voters at the next election, putting its thumping victory over Peter Dutton to use.But the lead-up to the summit hasn’t all been smooth sailing.It emerged on Wednesday that Chalmers and Albanese had held a face-to-face meeting last week aftera reported “frisson”over expectations for the summit. Albanese appeared frustrated at some mission creep for the talks and the pair discussed the need to “be on the same page” about major tax reform plans and the scale of Labor’s ambition. After the story emerged, both were quick to say they meet all the time, while the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, talked up their cooperation at the heart of the government.Despite not wanting to shut down ideas ahead of the summit, Albanese and Chalmers have rejected calls to change the rate and base of the GST and ruled out negative gearing and capital gains tax concession rule changes. The Australian Council of Trade Unions called for a four-day week for workers, without any loss of pay, a reform that feels both eminently possible in the future but too ambitious for the present.The Greens want Labor to move faster with expensive plans for universal childcare, an ambition Albanese islaying the groundwork for already, while the Coalition is both taking part in the talks and deriding them as akin to a tour of Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory. It is unclear who will play the role of Augustus Gloop in this scenario.Coalition compares Labor’s economic summit to Willy Wonka’s golden tickets as it criticises ‘privileged talkfest’Read moreLabor can’t afford not to be bold. It has identified the productivity problem and told voters it is better placed than the Coalition to manage the economy. Chalmers wants to be remembered as a reforming treasurer, and aspires to higher office, but will need to convince his colleagues – and the sometimes more cautious prime minister – of the case for ambition.Chalmers and Albanese made their own job harder by raising the prospect of sweeping tax reform at the start of the process, only to quickly shut down some of the serious proposals in a bid to manage expectations.But the best way to undermine claims that the roundtable is a stage-managed talkfest is to make it a success: to take up real economic reform options that drive growth and boost productivity.Strengthening the budget and lifting living standards is as necessary as it is difficult, but buy-in from roundtable participants will be a crucial start – even if Labor has to spend political capital to get the job done.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsJim ChalmersAnthony AlbaneseAustralian economyProductivityLabor partynewsShareReuse this content"

Ukraine’s military claimed credit for the attack and the overnight bombing of an oil refinery at Samara on the Volga River, deep inside Russia.Ukraine’s general staff said the ship hit, the Port Olya-4, was “loaded with components” for Shahed-type drones “and ammunition from Iran”. The port, it added, was an “important logistics hub for the supply of military goods”.Kyiv’s forces have repeatedly shown they can strike military logistics and energy targets hundreds of miles insideRussia, although the attacks only appear to have a dampening impact on the Kremlin’s long-term war effort.Putin ready to make Ukraine deal, Trump says before Alaska summitRead moreAs the US president prepares to meet his Russian counterpart in Alaska to discuss ending the Ukraine war and other bilateral issues, Ukraine remains under pressure in the battle on land, as demonstrated by a breach in its defences in the eastern Donbas last weekend.Several Russian saboteur groups pierced the Ukrainian frontlines by about 6 miles in a strategically important part of the front in Donetsk province near the road junction of Dobropillya, where supply routes had passed east to Kramatorsk.On Friday troops from Kyiv’s elite Azov Corps were leading efforts alongside the 79th and 82nd brigades to mop up the infiltration, but the breach, while apparently contained, has not been eliminated.On Friday Ukraine’s president, Voldoymyr Zelenskyy, said Ukraine was succeeding in “countering the attempts of Russian forces to gain a foothold” – and said a decision had been made to further reinforce the sector and the regional frontline.Troop shortages and the sheer length of the active frontline, at more than 600 miles long, mean the point of contact is not continuously held. Instead, it is made up of a series of foxholes that Russian attackers seek to sneak past using small lightly armed deep reconnaissance groups (DRGs).Ukraine-Russia map FridayAn intense Russian effort to achieve drone superiority in the sector since early May has made it more difficult for Ukraine to repel the infiltrators, according to Sam Cranny-Evans, a military analyst with the Royal United Services Institute thinktank.The Russians, he said, had established “some form of aerial dominance” over the Pokrovsk area that had “enabled them to work on further isolating Ukrainian units in the area, hitting logistics vehicles moving to and from the front, as well as troop rotations”.Ukraine, he believed, may “struggle to respond to a breakthrough with the available forces” as a result, a challenge compounded by the fact that units such as the Azov that are thrown into the frontline to deal with Russian infiltrations “are already stressed and extended from several recent deployments”.Earlier this week, Zelenskyy described the attack as politically timed, and said Russia would use it to try to show US leaders it was gradually winning the war and that continuing support for Kyiv would be wasted.On Friday, referencing the summit, the president added: “The Russian army continues to suffer significant losses in its attempts to secure more favourable political positions for the Russian leadership at the meeting in Alaska.”Ukraine’s military released images of what appeared to be a significant fire at the Syzran oil refinery in Russia’s Samara region. The plant, the general staff said, “produces a wide range of fuels, including aviation kerosene” and supplied the country’s military.The Russian governor of Samara said a drone attack caused a fire at an unspecified “industrial enterprise” but that it had been put out quickly.The Shahed drones that bomb Ukraine’s cities nightly were designed in Iran, and earlier in the war Russia was dependent on supply from Tehran, with shipments travelling over the Caspian Sea between the two countries.However, Russia now makes Shahed drones in two factories of its own after the technology was shared – meaning Iran, also weakened after its own war with Israel, is a less significant military support.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpVladimir PutinEuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Police at the time initially refused to consider the murder a hate crime, and tens of thousands of people protested to demand justice.View image in fullscreenPeople march in tribute to Ilan Halimi in February 2006.Photograph: Pascal Pavani/AFP/Getty ImagesThe president of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, Yonathan Arfi, said on Friday that the felling of the tree was extremely painful. “There is nothing more cowardly, and those who have murdered his memory are no better than those who took his life 20 years ago,” he said. “This is not just another antisemitic act, it is a way for antisemites to shout that they are here more than ever.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Held prisoner for ransom, he was tortured for 24 days before he was found naked, bound and gagged on 13 February 2006.Youssouf Fofana, the head of the gang called the Barbarians, was sentenced to life in prison for Halimi’s murder. The son of Ivorian immigrants, Fofana had recruited followers among young people from Paris’s bleak immigrant suburbs.Two other trees planted in Halimi’s memory were vandalised and sawed down in 2019 in the southern suburb of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, where Halimi was found dying near a railway track.Reported antisemitic acts in France surged from 436 in 2022 to 1,676 in 2023, before dipping to 1,570 last year, according to the interior ministry.Explore more on these topicsFranceAntisemitismEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And if it’s a bad meeting, it’ll end very quickly, and if it’s a good meeting, we’re going to end up getting peace in the pretty near future.”View image in fullscreenTrump’s motorcade in Washington on Friday morning.Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APTrump also said a second meeting – not yet confirmed – between him, Putin and Zelenskyy would be the more decisive.“The second meeting is going to be very, very important, because that’s going to be a meeting where they make a deal. And I don’t want to use the word ‘divvy’ things up, but you know, to a certain extent, it’s not a bad term, OK?” Trump told Fox News Radio.He was referring to the possibility that Zelenskyy will have toaccept “land swaps”– the handing over of Ukrainian territory to Russia, potentially including some not captured by Moscow.Later on Thursday, Trump suggested that any second, trilateral meeting could happen quickly – and possibly take place in Alaska. “Tomorrow, all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly,” he said. “I’d like to see it actually happen, maybe in Alaska.”Map of Russian advances in UkraineAny such meeting would be a concession by Putin since he refuses to recognise Zelenskyy as the legitimate leader ofUkraine.Trump conceded he was unsure whether an immediate ceasefire could be achieved, but expressed interest in brokering a peace agreement. On Putin, he said: “I believe now, he’s convinced that he’s going to make a deal. I think he’s going to, and we’re going to find out.”Zelenskyy will face a difficult choice if Putin rejects Ukraine’s call for a full 30-day ceasefire and offers only a partial break in the fighting, particularly if Trump thinks a three-way meeting should still go ahead.The Ukrainian president spent much of Thursday in London discussingWednesday’s video call between European leaders and Trumpwith the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer. European leaders were largely relieved with the way the conversation went, but know Trump is unpredictable and prone to acting on instinct, rather than sticking to a script.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the gardens of 10 Downing Street.Photograph: Simon Dawson/No 10 Downing StreetThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said changes on the battlefield could make peace harder. “To achieve a peace, I think we all recognise that there’ll have to be some conversation about security guarantees,” he said.Trump has rejected offering such guarantees before, but it is possible European security guarantees could be agreed. Rubio said he believed Trump had spoken by phone to Putin four times and “felt it was important to now speak to him in person and look him in the eye and figure out what was possible and what isn’t”.Starmer and Zelenskyy met in Downing Street for breakfast on Thursday and hailed “a visible chance for peace” as long as Putin proved he was serious about ending the war.European leaders emerged from Wednesday’s meeting reassured that Trump was going into his summit focused on extracting Putin’s commitment to a durable ceasefire and was not seeking to negotiate over Ukraine’s head.The plan for Trump and Putin to hold a joint press conference after their talks suggests the White House is optimistic the summit will bring about a breakthrough. Moscow is determined that the summit should not just focus on Ukraine but also agree steps to restart US-Russian economic cooperation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a separate statement, Zelenskyy said there had been discussions about the security guarantees required to make any deal “truly durable if the United States succeeds in pressing Russia to stop the killing”.On Wednesday Starmer co-chaired a virtual meeting of the “coalition of the willing” – a European-led effort to send a peacekeeping force to Ukraine to enforce any deal – where he said there was a “viable” chance of a truce.On Thursday the prime minister gave Zelenskyy a bear hug in the street outside the door to No 10 in a symbol of continuing British solidarity with the Ukrainian cause. Similar public displays of solidarity followed thedisastrous February meetingbetween Trump and Zelenskyy, when the two leaders quarrelled in front of the cameras in the White House.View image in fullscreenZelenskyy and Starmer embrace in Downing Street.Photograph: James Veysey/ShutterstockFurther sanctions could be imposed on Russia should the Kremlin fail to engage, and Starmer said the UK was already working on its next package of measures targeting Moscow.Trump has frequently said he will know if he can achieve peace in Ukraine only by meeting Putin personally. He sets great faith in his personal relationship with the Russian leader, but on Wednesday he played down expectations of what he could do to persuade Putin to relent. At the same time he warned there would be“very severe consequences”for Russia if Putin did not agree to a ceasefire, a veiled threat to increase US sanctions on Russian oil exports.As Ukraine battles to hold lines, Trump may find Putin difficult to persuadeRead moreHe has so far held off from imposing such economic pressure on Russia, but by the end of the month the US is due to impose additional tariffs on Indian imports into the US as a punishment for India continuing to buy Russian oil.The UK would like to see the US consider other, more targeted sanctions, either on the shadow fleet of Russian oil tankers or on refineries that use Russian oil. But Moscow briefed that the Alaska summit, far from leading to extra economic pressure on the Russian economy, would instead include discussion and agreements on new US-Russian economic cooperation, a step that would relieve the pressure on Russian state finances.Some European leaders took heart from the detailed grasp of the issues shown on the call by the US vice-president, JD Vance, and by hints that Trump could be willing to contribute US assets to a European-led security guarantee for Ukraine in the event of a peace agreement.The Alaska summit, due to start at 11.30am local time (2030 BST), will include aone-to-one meetingbetween Trump and Putin, with interpreters, then a wider meeting.The Russian delegation will include the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov; the defence minister, Andrei Belousov; the finance minister, Anton Siluanov; the head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev; and Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaKeir StarmerForeign policyEuropeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The label was reversed before the man was attacked, one of the sources said.Earlier this week,Israel killed the Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif and three colleaguesin their makeshift newsroom, after claiming Sharif was a Hamas commander. The killings focused global attention on the extreme dangers faced by Palestinian journalists in Gaza and Israel’s efforts to manipulate media coverage of the war.Foreign reporters have been barred from entering Gaza apart from a few brief and tightly controlled trips with the Israeli military, who impose restrictions including a ban on speaking to Palestinians.Palestinian journalists reporting from the ground are the most at risk in the world, with more than 180 killed by Israeli attacks in less than two years, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Israel carried out 26 targeted killings of journalists in that period, the CPJ said, describing them as murders.Israel has produced an unconvincing dossier of unverified evidence on Sharif’s purported Hamas links, and failed to address how he would have juggled a military command role with regular broadcast duties in one of the most heavily surveilled places on Earth. Israel did not attempt to justify killing his three colleagues.Before the attack, press freedom groups and Sharif himself had warned that Israeli accusations of Hamas links, first made in 2024, were designed to “manufacture consent to kill”. They had been revived and repeated with increasing frequency after his reporting on famine in Gaza went viral.Intelligence sources told +972 magazine that the “legitimisation cell” worked to undermine the work done by Palestinian journalists as well as their protected status under international law.Officers were eager to find a media worker they could link to Hamas, because they were convinced Gaza-based journalists were “smearing [Israel’s] name in front of the world”, a source was quoted saying.In at least one case, they misrepresented evidence to falsely claim a reporter was an undercover militant, two sources said, although the designation was reversed before an attack was ordered.“They were eager to label him as a target, as a terrorist, to say it’s OK to attack him,” one recalled. “They said: during the day he’s a journalist, at night he’s a platoon commander. Everyone was excited. But there was a chain of errors and corner-cutting.”“In the end, they realised he really was a journalist,” the source added, and the reporter was taken off the target list.Israel’s government often gave the army orders about where the unit should focus their work, and the primary motive of the “legitimisation cell” was public relations, not national security, the sources said.When media criticism of Israel over a particular issue intensified the cell would be tasked with finding intelligence that could be declassified and used to counter the narrative, the magazine reported.“If the global media is talking about Israel killing innocent journalists, then immediately there’s a push to find one journalist who might not be so innocent, as if that somehow makes killing the other 20 acceptable,” the article quoted an intelligence source saying.The cell also reportedly sought information on Hamas’s use of schools and hospitals for military purposes, and failed attacks by Palestinian armed groups that harmed civilians there.Some in the unit were reportedly concerned about publishing classified material for public relations reasons rather than military or security objectives. Officers were told their work was crucial to Israel’s ability to keep fighting, one source said.“The idea was to (allow the military to) operate without pressure, so countries like America wouldn’t stop supplying weapons,” a second source said. “Anything that could bolster Israel’s international legitimacy to keep fighting.”The IDF has been approached for comment.On Friday, at least 16 Palestinians were killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza, including five who were trying to get food aid, medical sources told Al Jazeera.Israel also issued evacuation orders for northern parts of Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighbourhood, as it intensified military operations before a planned escalation of the ground war in Gaza, which has been widely criticised domestically and abroad.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warJournalist safetyWar reportingGazaPress freedomNewspapers & magazinesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Overnight temperatures in parts of Jordan and Israel this week remained a full 5C hotter.View image in fullscreenTemperature records have been set in the Jordan Valley.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianShibli said 2025 had already broken records for nighttime heat intensity in many parts of the country, though not for length or the number of events.The climate scientist added that she and her children were suffering, but that she “thanked God” for technology such as air conditioning, which she has in her home, office and car.“The people that can’t handle it are the people without air conditioning, and those who work on the street, like cleaners and builders,” she said.Daytime temperatures also reached deadly peaks, with highs of close to 50C in Israel and thePalestinian territories. The Israel Meteorological Service said the highest temperature recorded on Wednesday was 49.7C in Gilgal kibbutz, a settlement in the occupied West Bank, setting a historical record in the Jordan Valley.Aqaba, a port on the Red Sea, broke Jordan’s national heat record with a daytime maximum of 49.6C.Temperatures in Gaza were cooler but still soared above 40C. Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinians, said on Thursday the heat was “making an already desperate situation far worse” by increasing dehydration. It added that limited electricity and fuel – amid bombardments and forced displacement – meant there was no relief from the heat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Whoever harms the people of Israel, whoever kills children, whoever kills women … we will erase them,” Ben Gvir says in Hebrew.Barghouti tries to respond but is interrupted by Ben Gvir, who says: “No, you know this.

Announcing the review’s findings in May, Microsoft said it had “found no evidence to date” the Israeli military had failed to comply with its terms of service or used Azure “to target or harm people” in Gaza.However, the recent Guardian investigationprompted concerns among senior Microsoft executivesabout whether some of its Israel-based employees may have concealed information about how Unit 8200 uses Azure when questioned as part of the review.Microsoft said on Friday the new inquiry would expand on the earlier one, adding: “Microsoft appreciates that the Guardian’s recent report raises additional and precise allegations that merit a full and urgent review.”The company is also facing pressure from a worker-led campaign group, No Azure for Apartheid, which has accused it of “complicity in genocide and apartheid” and demanded it cut off “all ties to the Israeli military” and make them publicly known.Responding to the announcement, the group criticised Microsoft’s decision to launch an inquiry, describing it as “yet another tactic to delay” meeting its demands.Since the Guardian and its partners, +972 and Local Call, revealed Unit 8200’s sweeping surveillance project last week, Microsoft has been scrambling to assess what data the unit holds in Azure.Several Microsoft sources familiar with internal deliberations said the company’s leadership was concerned by information from Unit 8200 sources interviewed for the article, including claims that intelligence drawn from repositories of phone calls held in Azure had been used to research and identify bombing targets inGaza.Israel’s 22-month bombardment of the territory, launched after the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023, has killed more than 60,000 people, the majority of them civilians, according to the health authority in the territory, though the actual death toll is likely to be significantly higher.Senior Microsoft executives had in recent days considered an awkward scenario in which Unit 8200, an important and sensitive customer, could be in breach of the company’s terms of service and human rights commitments, sources said.Quick GuideContact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He is detained in Ganot prison, in central Israel, and is almost unrecognisable.Ben-Gvir’s visit had been described as being part of the pursuit of a policy of stricter conditions for Palestinian prisoners, but the emergence of the video suggests the footage may have been its primary purpose.“You won’t win. Whoever messes with the nation of Israel, whoever murders our children and women, we will wipe them out,” he says. “You should know this, [this happened] throughout history.”View image in fullscreenMarwan Barghouti being escorted to a court hearing in 2012.Photograph: Baz Ratner/ReutersBen-Gvir, the leader of the far-right Jewish Power party, said this year that “there is no reason for a gram of food or aid to enter Gaza”.He serves as the national security minister despite a conviction in 2007 for incitement to racism and supporting a terrorist organisation.Barghouti, who is sometimes compared to Nelson Mandela, is a senior figure in Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah movement and is hugely popular in in the West Bank and Gaza. He is seen as one of the few figures who could meaningfully reconcile rival Palestinian factions.Palestinians have long sought his release, reportedly including him in recent hostage negotiations, but Israel has refused.The footage of Barghouti shows the first images of him in a decade. The organisation that represents Palestinian prisoners has alleged that Israeli prison officers have assaulted him; a claim Israel has denied.In the video, Barghouti, who is standing in a white T-shirt, tries to speak, but Ben-Gvir interjects and the short clip ends. The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the incident, describing Ben-Gvir’s actions as “organised state terrorism”.The Palestinian Authority vice-president, Hussein al-Sheikh, described it as “the epitome of psychological, moral and physical terrorism”.The emergence of the footage follows similar grandstanding this week by Ben-Gvir’s fellow far-right minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who said he would “bury” the idea of Palestinian statehood after announcing a huge new illegal settlement construction.Explore more on these topicsIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Since then, they have imposed their interpretation of Islamic law on daily life, including sweeping restrictions on women and girls, based on edicts from their leader,Hibatullah Akhundzada.Friday’s anniversary programme, which also included speeches from cabinet members, was only for men. An outdoor sports performance, initially expected to feature Afghan athletes, did not take place.Rights groups, foreign governments and the UN have condemned the Taliban for their treatment of women and girls, who remain barred frommany jobs,education beyond sixth gradeand most public spaces.View image in fullscreenA helicopter drops flower petals above the Wazir Akbar Khan hilltop in Kabul.Photograph: Wakil Kohsar/AFP/Getty ImagesMembers of the United Afghan Women’s Movement for Freedom staged an indoor protest against Taliban rule on Friday in the north-eastern Takhar province.“This day marked the beginning of a black domination that excluded women from work, education, and social life,” the movement said in a statement shared with Associated Press. “We, the protesting women, remember this day not as a memory, but as an open wound of history, a wound that has not yet healed. The fall ofAfghanistanwas not the fall of our will. We stand, even in the darkness.”There was also an indoor protest in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad.Afghan women held up signs that said “Forgiving the Taliban is an act of enmity against humanity” and “August 15th is a dark day.” They were fully veiled, except for their eyes, in the photographs.View image in fullscreenTaliban fighters parade in the streets of Kabul during the celebrations.Photograph: Siddiqullah Alizai/APEarlier in the day, the Taliban leader had said God would severely punish Afghans who were ungrateful for Islamic rule in the country, according to a statement.Akhundzada, who is seldom seen in public, said in a statement that Afghans had endured hardships and made sacrifices for almost 50 years so that Islamic law, or sharia, could be established. Sharia had saved people from “corruption, oppression, usurpation, drugs, theft, robbery, and plunder”, he said.“These are great divine blessings that our people should not forget and, during the commemoration of Victory Day, express great gratitude to Allah Almighty so that the blessings will increase,” Akhundzada said in comments shared on X.“If, against God’s will, we fail to express gratitude for blessings and are ungrateful for them, we will be subjected to the severe punishment of Allah Almighty,” he said.ICC issues warrant for Taliban’s supreme leader for persecution of womenRead moreLast month, the international criminal court issued arrest warrants for Akhundzada and the chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, accusing them ofcrimes against humanityfor the persecution of women and girls.The ICC said there were “reasonable grounds to believe” they had ordered policies that deprived women and girls of “education, privacy and family life and the freedoms of movement, expression, thought, conscience and religion”.This year’s anniversary celebrations are more muted than last year’s, when the Taliban staged a military parade at a US airbase, drawing anger from Donald Trump about the abandoned American hardware on display.Afghanistan is also gripped by a humanitarian crisis made worse by the climate crisis, millions of Afghansexpelled from Iranand Pakistan, and a sharp drop in donor funding.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanTalibanSouth and central AsiaWomennewsShareReuse this content"

Cloudbursts have the potential to wreak havoc by causing intense flooding and landslides, affecting thousands of people in the mountainous regions.Experts say these intense downpours have become more frequent in recent years, partly owing to the climate crisis, and that the damage caused has also increased because of unplanned development in mountain regions.Dozens were injured as the deluge destroyed homes in villages in Buner, where authorities declared a state of emergency. Ambulances have transported 56 bodies to local hospitals, according to a government statement.View image in fullscreenAn aerial image shows Buner district submerged in flood water after flash floods.Photograph: APRescuers backed by boats and helicopters worked to reach stranded residents.

The rare and intense weather event blamed for deadly India flash floodRead moreDeaths were reported from different parts of Pakistan on Thursday. Bilal Faizi, a emergency service spokesperson in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said rescuers worked for hours to save 1,300 tourists after they were trapped by flash flooding and landslides in the Siran valley in Mansehra district on Thursday.The Gilgit-Baltistan region has been hit by multiple floods since July, sparking landslides along the Karakoram Highway, a key trade and travel route linking Pakistan and China that is used by tourists. The region is home to scenic glaciers that provide 75% of Pakistan’s stored water supply .Despite repeated government warnings about landslides and flash floods, many people still visited popular resorts in flood-hit areas in north and north-west Pakistan. A study released this week by World Weather Attribution, a network of international scientists, found rainfall from 24 June to 23 July was 10% to 15% heavier in Pakistan because of global heating. In 2022, the country’s worst monsoon season on record killed more than 1,700 people and caused an estimated $40bn (£29.5bn) in damage.1:06Dozens dead and hundreds missing after cloudburst triggers flood in Kashmir – videoIn Indian-administered Kashmir, rescuers searched for missing people in the remote Himalayan village of Chositi on Friday after60 people died in flash floods, officials said. Scores of people are missing.At least 300 people were rescued on Thursday after a powerful cloudburst sparked floods and landslides, but the operation was halted overnight. Officials said many missing people were believed to have been washed away.At least 50 seriously injured people were treated in local hospitals, many of them rescued from a stream filled with mud and debris. A disaster management official, Mohammed Irshad, said the number of missing people could increase.Meanwhile, more heavy rain is forecast for the area and is expected to cause flooding.Chositi in Kishtwar district is the last village accessible to motor vehicles on the route of an annual Hindu pilgrimage to a mountainous shrine. Officials said the pilgrimage, which began on 25 Julyand was scheduled to end on 5 September, was suspended.Flood waters swept away the main community kitchen set up for the pilgrims, as well as dozens of vehicles and motorbikes. More than 200 pilgrims were in the kitchen at the time of the flood, which also damaged or washed away many of the homes clustered in the foothills, officials said.View image in fullscreenRescue workers use earthmovers in the search for missing people after flash floods in Kishtwar district of Indian-administered Kashmir.Photograph: Farooq Khan/EPASneha, who gave only one name, said her husband and a daughter were swept away as flood water came down the mountain.

Authorities made makeshift bridges on Friday to help stranded pilgrims cross a muddy water channel, and used dozens of earthmovers to shift boulders, uproot trees and electricity poles and remove other debris.Throughout Friday, authorities evacuated almost 4,000 pilgrims stranded in various parts of the forested area, officials said.

Keny policethreatened her with arrestunder the Terrorism Act for holding a Palestinian flag and having signs saying “Free Gaza” and “Israel is committing genocide”.chartMurton filmed police telling her that even such general statements “all come under proscribed groups, which are terror groups that have been dictated by the government”.During the exchange, one officer said the phrase “Free Gaza” was “supportive of Palestine Action”, that it was illegal “to express an opinion or belief that is supportive of a proscribed organisation”, and that she had committed that offence with her signs.Falkner wrote: “Whilst we acknowledge police expertise in assessing security risks, we want to emphasise that any interference with protest rights must be lawful and assessed case by case.“Heavy-handed policing or blanket approaches risk creating a chilling effect, deterring citizens from exercising their fundamental rights to freedom of expression and assembly through fear of possible consequences.“This concern extends beyond those directly affected by police engagement to the broader health of our democracy, because the perception that peaceful protest may attract disproportionate police attention undermines confidence in our human rights protections.”Falkner urged ministers and police to make sure all officers were given “clear and consistent guidance on their human rights obligations in relation to protest”, which should “ensure that the appropriate balance is maintained between public safety and the protection of essential human rights”.Murton told the Guardian last week that her solicitorshad issued a letter of claimon her behalf to the chief constable of Kent police, in what was also said to be a move to remind other police forces of their responsibilities towards peaceful protests.Falkner said in a statement: “The right to peaceful protest is fundamental to our democracy and must be protected even when dealing with complex and sensitive issues.“We recognise the genuine challenges the police face in maintaining public safety, but we are concerned that some recent responses may not strike the right balance between security and fundamental rights.“Our role as the national human rights institution is to uphold the laws that safeguard everyone’s right to fairness, dignity and respect. When we see reports of people being questioned or prevented from peaceful protests that don’t support proscribed organisations, we have a duty to speak out.”The Liberal Democrats called on Cooper to act swiftly. Lisa Smart, the party’s home affairs spokesperson, said: “The lack of clarity that has been given to police officers has led to confusion, increasing tensions and risks creating a chilling effect on freedom of speech.“The home secretary needs to step in and give officers, often dealing with incredibly complex and sensitive situations, clear direction as to what is expected of them at protests.“Without that officers will be left exposed and those exercising their democratic rights worried about the consequences.”The warning comes in the context of wider police operations targeting protesters who, unlike Murton, appear to directly express support for Palestine Action, which is illegal given the group’s banned status.Membership of, or support for, the group is a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison under the Terrorism Act.The group was proscribed last month after incidents includingone in which four people were arrestedover damaged caused to two Voyager aircraft at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.In the latest of a series of mass protests against the decision, more than 500 peoplewere arrestedin London last Saturday, almost all for displaying placards or signs allegedly supportive of Palestine Action. Half of those arrested were aged 60 or above, according to police figures. On Friday night the Metropolitan poice said a further 60 people would be prosecuted for “showing support for the proscribed terrorist group Palestine Action”.Amnesty International UK said that while it welcomed the EHRC letter, the watchdog had “failed to acknowledge the hundreds of people unfairly arrested for peacefully exercising their right to free expression”.Sacha Deshmukh, the organisation’s chief executive, said: “This isn’t just about the chilling effect on freedom of speech for people ‘not linked to any proscribed organisation’, as the EHRC states, it’s also about the excessive policing of citizens’ right to protest against a decision made by their elected government.“Under international human rights law, protest speech should only be criminalised if it incites violence, hatred or discrimination. Holding a placard and peacefully stating opposition to a government decision to proscribe an organisation cannot realistically be treated as an example of incitement.”Downing Street has justified the ban on Palestine Action by saying it is “a violent organisation that has committed violence, significant injury, extensive criminal damage”, a description one of its co-foundershas saidis false and defamatory.The Home Office said the issues the EHRC had raised were an operational matter for the police. The Met referred the query to the Home Office.Explore more on these topicsProtestEquality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)Human rightsUK security and counter-terrorismPoliceYvette CoopernewsShareReuse this content"

But why are London schools outperforming all other regions?Here are some reasons:1.The London ChallengeIn 2003, the Blair government launched an initiative to transform schools in the capital. At the time, London schools were perceived to be some of the worst in the country. At its peak, the London Challenge had a budget of£40m a year, working with local authorities, investing in school leadership, building new secondary schools and sixth forms, as well as radically expanding the academisation of new and existing schools. There was also an incentive to build extended schools that offered services to students and their families outside the classroom. As a result, 30% of London schools were graded as outstanding in 2010 byOfsted, compared with 17.5% nationally. Although the Schools Challenge was later stretched to Greater Manchester and the Black Country, London is considered to be the success story.2.TeachersDue to higher pay and cultural attractiveness, teachers are more inclined to train and work in the capital, therefore a higher level of teaching is arguably available to London students. TheTeach First programmewas a targeted intervention that started in 2002 with the aim of recruiting university graduates to train as teachers in challenging schools. The first cohort of trainees were placedexclusivelyin London secondary schools between 2003 and 2006. Although trainees are distributed across regions, London has the highest concentration, with more than a quarter of Teach First schools being in the capital in 2019.3.GentrificationThe changing class demographics in London have had a noticeable effect on the quality of schools in the city. In the past few decades, young families have chosen to remain in there rather than moving to suburban areas, as once was the norm. As a result, formerly impoverished boroughs such as Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Brixton have become more middle class and, over time, schools in the capital have received an increased number of pupils from families with higher levels of education, improving the schools’ results.4.ImmigrationLondon remains the most ethnically diverse region in the country. Research shows that parents from migrant families often have higher ambitions of social mobility through educational means, knownacademicallyas the “London effect”. In 2017, the former education secretary Michael Govesaid“there’s lots of evidence that London having become more diverse has contributed to educational standards rising”. However,researchfrom King’s College London shows that, if only white London pupils are considered, London still outperforms all other regions in the UK.5.Range of schoolsLondon contains a higher concentration of schools within one region. This gives families more choice to send their children to schools and sixth forms that align with their interests and academic progression. Additionally, students are able to commute across the capital, granting the opportunity to attend specialist schools that may have otherwise been out of reach.Explore more on these topicsSchoolsEnglandA-levelsExamsnewsShareReuse this content"

The dolphin bobbed in and out of the water, playfully engaging them and receiving belly rubs.Though the interaction appeared jovial and harmless, the MMO has issued a strict warning that such encounters “can harm dolphins leading to injury, death, or aggression”, urging the public to keep its distance.The MMO said the public should “never swim with, touch, feed, or approach dolphins. If a dolphin approaches you, calmly leave the area.”“Human interaction can cause dolphins to lose their natural wariness, leading to injury or even death,” the agency added. “Disturbed dolphins are also known to become aggressive toward people.“Dolphins may seem friendly, but they are wild animals. The dolphin in Lyme Bay has already been injured by a suspected boat propeller,” the MMO said. “Let’s protect them by keeping our distance and please share this message to respect their space.”Could giving this pod of dolphins the same legal rights as humans help keep them safe?Read moreWhale and Dolphin Conservation, a charity dedicated to protecting wild dolphins and whales, says dolphins can be disturbed not only by jetskis and motorboats but any intrusive human interaction. When people encounter dolphins, the WDC advises keeping a safe distance, leaving after about 15 minutes, and ensuring no more than two boats are within 300 metres of a group of dolphins.According to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, 28 different species of whales, dolphins and porpoises have been recorded in UK waters – including four types of dolphin: bottlenose, common, Risso’s and white-beaked. There are an estimated 700 bottlenose dolphins living off the UK’s shores.They can be encountered fairly regularly off the British coast, potentially coming into contact with swimmers or people sailing, interactions that can cause the animals harm.Explore more on these topicsDolphinsDorsetWildlifeMarine lifeEnglandCetaceansAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is a surprisingly invasive process. Although it is known that many women experience abdominal pain and slight bleeding during implantation, the process itself had never been observed before.”Embryo implantation occurs when a fertilised egg attaches to the lining of the uterus about six to 12 days after ovulation.A platform that allows embryos to implant outside the uterus under controlled conditions was developed by the researchers. This platform, based on a gel made partly by collagen and uterine tissue, then enabled real-time fluorescence imaging and analysis of the embryo’s interactions with its environment.Embryos digging in to the uterine matrixAfter this, researchers carried out experiments with human and mouse embryos to compare the two implantation processes. They discovered that while a mouse embryo sticks to its surface, a human embryo penetrates the uterine tissue completely before growing from the inside out.The study also showed that during the implantation process, the human embryo released enzymes that broke down the surrounding tissue, and that this embryo also exerted traction forces on its environment.The failure of the implantation process is one of the maincauses of infertility, accounting for about 60% of miscarriages. According to the researchers, this study, which helps to improve understanding of the implantation process, could have a significant impact on fertility rates.Amélie Godeau, a researcher and co-first author of the study, said: “We observe that the embryo pulls on the uterine matrix, moving and reorganising it. It also reacts to external force cues. We hypothesise that contractions occurringin vivomay influence embryo implantation.”Explore more on these topicsScienceFertility problemsHealthBiologyWomen's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

The party said there had been no discussions about alternative candidates at any NEC meetings and no proposals put to NEC members about a selection process.Abbott said: “It does seem to be rather pre-empting the results of the investigation.”One figure on the left of the party said talk of replacing Abbott risked inflaming tensions between the leadership and grassroots members. “There’s no appetite among members for a stitch-up, they would want this to be fair after everything that’s happened,” they said.Abbott, who as the longest-serving female MP has the honorary title of mother of the house,lost the Labour whipin autumn 2023 after she wrote a letter to the Observer in which she argued that Jewish, Irish and Traveller people did not experience racism in the same way as Black people and likened their experience to that of people with red hair.Abbott said the letter published was a draft version, and that her comments had been taken out of context. She was readmitted to the party in time to retain her seat at the general election, but wassuspended again last monthafter telling the BBC in an interview that she did not regret the remarks.The Guardian understands that potential successors to Abbott include those who were in the frame to replace before general election, among them the London assembly member Sem Moema and the Hackney councillor Mete Coban.Abbott’s latest suspension caused unease among some party insiders, including NEC members, but they said her decision to repeat her original comments, despite previously apologising, made it harder for them to defend her.Labour sources have briefed that Abbott is unlikely to be readmitted to the parliamentary Labour party. It is thought that she plans to stand down at the next election, if not sooner. Sources close to the process said discussions about a potential successor are too important to be left to the last minute.Under party rules, a suspended MP is barred from standing as a candidate until their case is resolved. The NEC has the power to trigger a selection process if a sitting MP is not endorsed to stand again.The row over Abbott’s future comes as Labour prepares for its autumn conference.The disciplinary process over Abbott’s original Observer letter became one of the longest and most prominent internal rows of Keir Starmer’s leadership. Allies accused party leaders of deliberately dragging their feet to prevent her re-selection, while Labour HQ insisted the investigation was handled according to the rules.The seat is regarded as ultra-safe for Labour, even although her majority last year was halved to 15,000 last year amid a challenge from the Greens.Explore more on these topicsDiane AbbottLabournewsShareReuse this content"

In the Senate, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland will sponsor the resolution.‘It’s not illegal to be homeless’: disquiet as Trump crews clear DC encampmentsRead more“The only emergency here is a lawless president experiencing a growing public relations emergency because of hisclose friendshipwith Jeffrey Epstein and his stubborn refusal to release the Epstein file despite his promise to do so,” said Raskin in a statement shared with the Guardian.The Home Rule Act of 1973 states that DC residents have the authority to govern their local affairs, including by electing a mayor and local council members. But because DC is considered a “federal district” rather than a state, the president and Congress (where DC residents have no voting representatives) are given the legal ability to manage local laws and local tax dollars.Under the act, the president has limited power to temporarily take over the DC police department for “federal purposes” under “special conditions of an emergency”. On Monday, Trump signed an executive order granting himselfdirect control of the MPDin a highly controversial andsuspected premeditatedmove.But lawmakers argue that the special conditions have not been met and that Congress has the authority to end such emergency control through a joint resolution.In a substantial development early on Friday evening, White House officials and attorneys for Washington DC agreed to scale back the executive order of the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, regarding the federal takeover of the city’s police department.Under the new agreement, DC’s Metropolitan police department will remain under the control of the DC police chief, Pamela Smith, instead of the Drug and Enforcement Administration’s top administrator, Terry Cole,accordingtoreports.According to the joint resolution’s sponsors, the president has attempted to rationalize his decision to place local police under federal control and increase militarization of the city by pushing a misleading account of DC’s crime rate, which has actually declined for two consecutive years andrecently hit its lowest pointin three decades.“President Trump’s incursions against DC are among the most egregious attacks on DC home rule in decades,” said Norton. “DC residents are Americans, worthy of the same autonomy granted to residents of the states … No emergency exists in DC that the president did not create himself, and he is not using the DC Police for federal purposes, as required by law.”Lawmakers say that his actions have worsened public safety by blocking DC’s access to $1bn in locally generated funds intended for police, fire, emergency services and other safety programs.Additionally, the resolution notes that Trump has removed or reassigned many of DC’s prosecutors, creating a backlog in criminal cases and delaying justice for victims. He also pardoned or granted clemency to nearly 1,600 people involved in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol in 2021, including hundreds found guilty of assaulting law enforcement officers.Explore more on these topicsWashington DCUS CongressUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS policingnewsShareReuse this content"

Cantrell and the bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, allegedly plotted to foster their personal and romantic relationship while he was clocked in at work and being paid to provide her with protection.As Guardian reporting partner WWL Louisianareported, Cantrell also allegedly arranged for Vappie to accompany her on at least 14 out-of-state trips, including to Scotland and the United Arab Emirates,claiming concerns about her safety that required protection. The trips cost the New Orleans’ city government more than $70,000, not counting Cantrell’s travel expenses, the charging documents filed on Friday said.The pair were also accused of using a city-owned apartment on the edge of New Orleans’s Jackson Square, in its historic French Quarter neighborhood, to spend time together while Vappie was supposed to be on duty.Cantrell and Vappie, 52, are accused of then seeking to cover up the relationship by using an encrypted messaging program and deleting at least some of the 15,000 messages they exchanged, as well as lying to federal agents, grand jurors, colleagues and the public.When a New Orleans resident took photos of the Cantrell and Vappie dining together and drinking wine, the mayor filed a police report and temporarily obtained a restraining order, he said.Friday’s charges also allege that Vappie “attempted to persuade” New Orleans’s interim police superintendent from December 2022 to October 2023, Michelle Woodfork, to “make it right” and exonerate him as investigators circled.Cantrell then met with Woodfork – in front of Vappie – and told her she would not be offered the long-term superintendent’s post, the indictment contended.Cantrell and Vappie are facing charges of wire fraud, obstruction of justice, conspiracy to commit both of those crimes, false statements and untrue declarations to a grand jury.Vappie had already been charged in July 2024 – shortly after he retired from the New Orleans police – with wire fraud and lying to FBI agents.The allegations against him and Cantrell called to mind the 2018 scandal thatcostthe Nashville mayor, Megan Barry, her job and centered on an affair with her bodyguard, Robert Forrest. Prosecutors who obtained the 2024 charges against Vappie alleged he researched that case online two years beforehand.Friday’s charges against Cantrell also come after the September 2024 indictment of New Orleans businessman Randy Farrell. Farrell was charged with exchanging gifts with the mayor so she would allegedly fire a municipal employee who was investigating Farrell’s building inspection company.Among the alleged gifts were tickets to a January 2019 New Orleans Saints football game, which was being played with a Super Bowl appearance on the line, a cellphone and lunch at an upscale Ruth’s Chris Steak House in the city.Vappie and Farrell had pleaded not guilty to the charges previously filed against them.While theDonald Trump-led US justice department obtained the indictment against Cantrell about seven months into the Republican’s second presidency, the federal investigation into the mayor began while Joe Biden – her fellow Democrat – was in his second full year in the Oval Office.The timing of Friday’s indictment coincided with the grand jurors being scheduled to wind down their work. Such panels are typically in place for six months, but this one had been extended twice since first convening in February 2024.Cantrell’s office issued a statement saying it would not comment on Friday’s indictment until it had been reviewed by her defense attorney, Eddie Castaing.At a press briefing, the acting US attorney in New Orleans, Michael Simpson, accused Cantrell and Vappie of “an incredible betrayal” of the public’s trust in its own government.Cantrell, a native of Compton, California, had been a New Orleans city council member beforewinning electionas its first-ever female mayor in November 2017.She succeeded Mitch Landrieu, who later worked for Biden’s White House as its infrastructure czar.The Cantrell administration’s first four-year term was partly marked by its guiding the city through the Covid-19 pandemic. And, in 2019, New Orleans registered a 47-year low of homicides.Cantrell wasre-electedin November 2021, and her second term has been considerably turbulent.The federal investigation began with 2022 subpoenas issued regarding an image consultant she employed. Her husband – Jason, with whom she had a daughter – unexpectedly died in August 2023.And, as the AP noted, her civic profile receded as she locked herself into feuds with a hostile city council while alienating former confidantes as well as supporters. The city council responded by weakening the mayor’s power through voter-approved changes to the municipal governing charter.Cantrell and her remaining allies maintain that, as a Black woman, she has been treated differently from her male predecessors.Simpson on Friday denied that race or gender factored into the investigation against Cantrell.Cantrell was term-limited from seeking another stint as mayor and is due to leave office in January. Several candidates have signed up to run to replace her in a primary election set for October.Only one other person who has served as New Orleans mayor has been charged with federal crimes: Ray Nagin.Nagin was the New Orleans mayor when the failure of federal levees there during Hurricane Katrina on 29 August 2005 destroyed the city and caused about 1,400 deaths. He was charged after leaving office and convicted in 2014 on charges of bribery, honest services wire fraud, money laundering, filing false tax returns and conspiracy. He then received a 10-year prisonsentence.TheAssociated Press and WWLLouisianacontributed reportingExplore more on these topicsNew OrleansUS crimeLouisianaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The agency has returnedmore than $21bnto US consumers since its founding.Workers at top US consumer watchdog sound warning as Trump bids to gut agencyRead moreRussell Vought, director of the office of management and budget and the architect of Project 2025, the rightwing blueprint drawn up ahead of Trump’s re-election, was appointed acting director of the CFPB in February.TheTrump administrationhas yet to nominate a permanent candidate for the director role since withdrawing its previous nominee in May.US circuit judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both Trump appointees, ruled in favor of the administration on Friday. The district court behind the initial decision “lacked jurisdiction to consider the claims predicated on loss of employment”, the majority wrote.In a dissent, circuit judge Cornelia Pillard, who was appointed by Barack Obama, said the lower court had acted properly in blocking the Trump administration from eradicating the CFPB entirely as the lawsuit played out.Pillard wrote: “It is emphatically not within the discretion of the President or his appointees to decide that the country would benefit most if there were no Bureau at all.”Senator Elizabeth Warren, ranking member of the Senate banking, housing, and urban affairs committee who played a significant role in the creation of the CFPB, said: “Today’s divided panel decision willfully ignores the Trump administration’s unprecedented and lawless attempt to destroy an agency created by Congress that has helped millions of families across the country.”The ruling was described as a “disgrace” by Cat Farman, president of the CFPB union. “It empowers Donald Trump to unilaterally eliminate vital public services established by Congress. Without a functioning CFPB, there is less oversight of the biggest banks, which means more fraud and less help for veterans and the elderly who are major targets for financial scams.”Farman added: “[CFPB workers] aren’t giving up our fight to defend the rule of law from executive overreach and protect the hard-earned paychecks of working people from Wall Street greed.”Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationLaw (US)US politicsConsumer rightsUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

It would also help shore up the chipmaker’s finances at a time whenIntelhas been slashing jobs as part of a wider cost-cutting drive.Talks over the potential investment stem from a meeting that took place between the US president, Donald Trump, and the Intel chief executive, Lip-Bu Tan, this week, days after Trumpcalled for Tan to resign, accusing him of having ties to the Chinese Communist party. Bloomberg suggested Tan was likely to stay in charge of the chipmaker.Trump calls for resignation of Intel chief a day after 100% chip tariff threatRead moreCommenting on the Bloomberg report, the White House spokesperson Kush Desai said: “Discussion about hypothetical deals should be regarded as speculation unless officially announced by the administration.”However, the news still sparked excitement among investors, with shares rising as much as 8.9% on Thursday before closing 7.4% higher at the end of trading at $23.86 (£17.60). That pushed the company’s market value to $104.4bn.A stake in Intel would mark the Trump administration’s latest attempt to intervene in key private industry. He has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs of up to 100% on imported semiconductors and chips, which could favour Intel as a US-based semiconductor firm.Earlier this week, the US government announced a deal that would result in the chipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devicespaying 15% of their revenues from Chinese AI chip sales to the US government. Last month, the defence department also announced it would take a $400m preferred stake in the US rare earth producer MP Materials.However, an investment in Intel would mark a U-turn from Trump’s recent aggressive rhetoric against the company’s leadership.Trump took to the Truth Social media platform on Thursday last week to allege: “The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!”Trump’s social media outburst came shortly after the US Republican senator Tom Cotton wrote a letter to the Intel chair, Frank Yeary, over Tan’s investments and ties to semiconductor companies that are reportedly linked to the CCP and the People’s Liberation Army, the party’s military arm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Certified pedophiles.” The artwork for the global hit single features an image of Drake’s home dotted with icons used to identify the homes of registered sex offenders.Drake has denied the allegations, and in January filed a lawsuit against UMG – not Lamar himself – alleging that it “approved, published and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track” that was “intended to convey the specific, unmistakable and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response”.The label initially responded that the suit was “utterly without merit”.View image in fullscreenLucian Grainge said that he never heard the song prior to its release.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesDrake’s latest motion argued that Drake believes “Grainge was personally involved in decisions made regarding the marketing and promotion of [Not Like Us] around its release”.Lawyers for UMG have now called for Drake’s motion to be denied, labelling it a “transparent attempt to use discovery to harass UMG and force it to waste time and resources out of spite” and that his “attempts to show Sir Lucian’s relevance are so strained that they defy credulity”.In legal documents, Grainge declared that he never heard the song prior to its release.Lawyer Rollin A Ransom continued: “The premise of Drake’s motion – that he could not have lost a rap battle unless it was the product of some imagined secret conspiracy going to the top of UMG’s corporate structure – is absurd. Sir Lucian is the CEO of a multinational enterprise; his days are spent determining and implementing global strategy, not vetting individual tracks or album covers or driving the release and promotional plans for any one recording.”Drake previously agreed not to seek documents from Grainge, the letter states. “And even if Sir Lucian had any responsive documents, they would surely be captured by discovery from UMG’s other document custodians, who were actually responsible for releasing and promoting Not Like Us. Drake does not come close to meeting his burden of showing that Sir Lucian must be a custodian.”The letter concludes: “Drake argues that Sir Lucian must be a custodian for no other reason than because Drake asked for him. That is entirely inconsistent with the law and is particularly inappropriate given that Drake’s request is clearly based on a desire to harass UMG, rather than for a legitimate reason.”Drake has not responded to the new filing. The Guardian has contacted his representatives.UMG is seeking to have the case dismissed entirely,claiming in Marchthat Drake “lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated … diss tracks are a popular and celebrated art form centred around outrageous insults, and they would be severely chilled if Drake’s suit were permitted to proceed”.Explore more on these topicsDrakeKendrick LamarUniversal MusicnewsShareReuse this content"

But he knew for sure they would be a big hindrance as soon asDonald Trumpannounced late last month that he was slapping a 15% levy on all goods from the European Union.“The first email I received was from my cork provider,” Burke recalled. “He said he’d take on 2% of the additional cost of importing corks from Europe, but I would have to absorb the other 13%. Then my barrel supplier got in touch, pushing me to put in my orders as fast as possible because every new French barrel coming across the Atlantic after the tariffs was going to come with a $100 or $150 fee.”Every one of these messages was a gut punch for Burke’s five-year-old family-run business, Dresser Winery, which sits on an idyllic hillside outside Paso Robles and specializes in big, bold reds. Burke sent a note out to his wine club members earlier this year telling them he did not plan on increasing prices for the fall shipment, but he realized he could no longer honor the commitment.“If we do that,” he said flatly, “we have to shut the business down.”It turns out even US wine producers are heavily reliant on foreign components – everything from French oak barrels, which give the wine a buttery, vanilla finish in contrast to the much less appealing brown sugar taste of American oak, to glass bottles and corks and the wine-making equipment itself.“Every single product we use, from our pumps to the de-stemmer, comes with instructions written in six languages,” Burke explained. “Could we produce some of these things here? Sure, but it would take three years to get production up and running, and that’s not the way the specialization has been.”As another producer from Paso Robles, Paul Hoover of Still Waters Vineyards, put it: “The only thing in my bottles made in America is the wine.”Ostensibly, Trump’s tariffs on imported goods are supposed to give a competitive boost to American entrepreneurs like Burke and Hoover. But the theory does not really apply to the wine business – not only because so many of the materials used to makeCaliforniawine come from overseas, but also because people do not buy wine based on price alone.“It is a fundamental misunderstanding of wine drinkers and the wine marketplace,” the National Association of Wine Retailers, an industry lobby group, said in ablistering statementin response to the 15% tariff announcement.View image in fullscreen‘When an American wine drinker asks for red Burgundy, they do not substitute Oregon pinot noir when the Burgundy is out of their price range or unavailable. They simply don’t make a purchase.’Photograph: Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images“Champagne is not sparkling wine. Bordeaux is not simply cabernet sauvignon or merlot … America’s independent fine wine retailers understand better than most that when an American wine drinker asks for red Burgundy, they do not substitute Oregon pinot noir when the Burgundy is out of their price range or unavailable. They simply don’t make a purchase.”Burke echoed this sentiment, saying he had to control his reaction recently when a Trump supporter came to his winery and told him he must be excited about the business opportunities the tariffs will create. “People aren’t buying my bottles because of tariffs on French wines, that’s for sure,” he said. “If anything, I’m competing against other Californian and American wines. With European wines, it’s not a real competition at all. They’re very different regions, very different products.”California wines are far from the cheapest because of the high cost of land and labour in the Golden state. For that reason, many producers live or die by the quality of what they make and the sort of subtle distinctions that come from varietals grown in a particular microclimate, or in a particular soil, or aged in a particular barrel.Price still matters, because fine wines are a discretionary spending item, and if the economy or people’s personal finances are struggling it is often one of the first things that consumers stop buying. The National Association of Wine Retailers, said it was worried about tariffs generally, not just on wine, because inflation and an uncertain business climate would hurt its members’ bottom line just as much.“The increased costs of living that will result from the recently enacted tariffs, along with the significant increase in prices for wines … will only push down consumption further, thereby harming the American wine industry to a degree from which many of its participants will not recover,” the group said.In Paso Robles, which has seen an explosion in the number of wineries over the past two decades to about 250 and has become a major weekend tourist hub for wine lovers from San Francisco and Los Angeles, some of the harmful effects are being felt already.Joel Peterson, executive director of the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance, said international orders were drying up as the reverberations from Trump’s trade war echo around the globe. “We have wine sitting in a warehouse that is specially labeled for the Canadian market that producers can’t sell,” he said. “We’ve had no orders from the UK since Trump’s so-called Liberation Day in April. People are scared to order those wines.”Domestic retailers say they have not seen significant price increases kick in yet – for either domestic or European wines – but are already starting to struggle simply because of the uncertainty created by the White House’s constantly shifting messages on where and at what rate it intends to impose tariffs.“We’re not in a recession but it’s what I call a recess market,” said Jim Knight, co-owner of the Wine House in Los Angeles, which specializes in small-label boutique wines from the United States and around the world. “People have money, they’re just not spending it … If the president made a decision and stuck with it, we could plan for it. But we haven’t been able to plan for it.”Knight’s business has a particular problem with high-end French wines it bought in advance years ago – right after the grapes were harvested – and presold to customers with an anticipated 10% mark-up. When tariffs on European wines were briefly at 10% earlier this year, Knight was looking at his entire profit being wiped out, since tariffs are imposed when goods arrive in the United States, not when they are purchased. Now, at 15%, he’s looking at taking a loss that might force him to lay off workers or otherwise shrink his business.For now, he is letting the wine sit in a temperature-controlled storage unit in France and hoping Trump might still bend to pressure from the industry to create a tariff exception for wines and spirits. An industry initiative calledToasts not Tariffshas been lobbying the White House hard to do exactly that.More broadly, Knight said he was worried that small European producers would no longer offer their limited production to the US market, and that some of the specialist importers, the ones who love the same smaller label wines he does, will go out of business. “Importers of wine from the European Union are American businesses too,” he remarked.That helps explain why a US distributor of European wines and spirits,VOS Selectionsof New York, has been the lead plaintiff in alawsuitchallenging the constitutionality of Trump’s tariffs – a case that led to an initial ruling against the administration in the court of international trade at the end of May.Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University who has spearheaded the suit, said the nature of the wine business was a vivid illustration of the harm that tariffs can do. “Many of the wines our client imports simply cannot be produced in the United States because of differences in climate, soil and other factors,” he said. “We’re not benefiting American industry, we’re damaging it and hurting consumers.”Not every wine producer sees the economic outlook as uniformly gloomy. Hoover, of Still Waters Vineyards, said the cost of storing and transporting wine was a greater burden than the price of corks or bottles – particularly for California producers who have too much inventory on their hands following a post-Covid boom-and-bust cycle. He said he was relieved at adrop in fuel pricesin recent months and saw opportunities if they fell further.He was modestly hopeful, for example, that he could tap into sales opportunities on the east coast where he was previously priced out. “Before the tariffs, a boat coming from Europe could deliver wine to the east coast more efficiently than I could getting it across the United States on a truck,” he said. “Let’s see how that looks going forward. Energy costs are the key to this. Let’s hope the tariffs don’t monkey that up.”One of the main reasons that people in the wine business do not believe the tariffs will benefit domestic producers, as the White House is promising, is that they have seen this scenario play out before, during Trump’s first term as president.In 2019, the administration imposed a25% tariffon most European wines, among other products, in retaliation for European subsidies on Airbus passenger jets. Trump said at the time that the relatively low price of French wines was unfair to California producers, but no evidence emerged that the tariff did anything to redress that perceived unfairness. “It did not increase my domestic wine sales at all,” Knight said.Explore more on these topicsWineWest CoastCaliforniaTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But new tariffs threaten her business modelAdvertising partnerAbout this contentAimee RawlinsFri 15 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 09.55 EDTShareIn 2016, turmeric lattes wereall the rage, but Sana Javeri Kadri thought the ones in San Francisco, where she lives, tasted nothing like the fresh spices she grew up with in India.A former line cook who was doing marketing for a Bay Area grocer, Javeri Kadri “knew [her] way around spices”, but was new to the industry. Still, she booked a ticket home to Mumbai, hoping that she could get richer flavors into US pantries.After reaching out to a number of growers, she met an organic turmeric farmer and, using her tax refund and a loan from her parents, bought a batch of the crop. It became the foundation of Diaspora Co, which Javeri Kadri launched the following year at just 23.From the outset, Javeri Kadri aimed to bypass industrial spice farms, whose products she found bland, and instead source from farmers using regenerative practices. This meant working directly with the producers and paying them a living wage.“By rough math, I probably reached out to around 2,500 farmers,” she said.After two years of growing a US market for her turmeric, Javeri Kadri added black pepper to the mix. For a while after that, it was an “exponential growth curve”, she said.Today Diaspora Co has 24 employees and sells around 40 different spices and blends, sourced from 140 different farms in India and Sri Lanka.View image in fullscreenDiaspora Co spice products on display at in the spice aisle at Gjusta Grocer.Photograph: Jonathan Alcorn/The GuardianDiaspora Co is part of a wave of new spice companies, includingBurlap & Barreland Spicewalla, that center sourcing from sustainable farms, paying producers a living wage, building a more transparent (and streamlined) supply chain – steps they say allow them to put noticeably fresher spices on the market.Javeri Kadri said it was common knowledge in the industry that because of the long supply chains, it can take years for spices to reach consumers, meaning they are “expired before they even get to you”.She said Diaspora Co farmers rotate their crops, maintain plant diversity and use water-retention systems – regenerative practices that not only minimize the farms’ carbon footprint, but also make them more resilient to climate shocks.That meant when extreme flooding struck Tamil Nadu, India, last year, Diaspora’s cardamom farm “had such great aerated soil and such good irrigation, they were only in standing water for a few hours before the soil and the property was able to flush itself clean”, minimizing losses, she said.Javeri Kadri stressed that her partners were already practicing sustainable agriculture before she arrived on the scene, but she connects them with each other. “If you get them talking, they problem-solve themselves,” she said. “They’re all experts.”Diaspora Co enjoys low worker turnover and lasting partnerships, something Javeri Kadri attributes to the company’s commitment to fair wages. “Once we build a relationship with them, it never goes anywhere,” she said.In 2022, Diaspora Co launched a fund for farm workers, offering financial literacy workshops and providing seed money to open bank accounts, among other things. At a cardamom farm, workers asked for a community room and kitchen, which Javeri Kadri admitted wasn’t what she expected. But “it’s what they need, not what we think sitting in America that they need,” she said. “Really the point of it is that we listen to the workers directly.”Franco Fubini, a Diaspora Co board member and founder and CEO of sustainable food sourcing platform Natoora, said Javeri Kadri wasn’t just “trading spices”, she was building a unique supply chain and helping to catalyze demand for products that “are created in harmony with nature”.He added: “Whenever you have a company that is creating a market by stimulating demand, buying the right product, paying the right price for it, and creating a healthy farming ecosystem – that is what revolutionizing the food system is all about.”Diaspora’s efforts to, as Javeri Kadri puts it, “decolonize the spice trade” have also proven profitable. She’s raised about $2.5m from angel investors in the last few years, and though she declined to share revenue numbers, she said the company had grown twentyfold over the past five years. Its spices are now sold in 400 US stores, and last year, with help from Natoora, Diaspora Co expanded into the UK.View image in fullscreenSana Javeri Kadri adjusts her company’s spice products on display at Gjusta Grocer.Photograph: Jonathan Alcorn/The GuardianRather than pressuring existing partners to produce more and more, which could tax the land (and workers), Javeri Kadri said she plans to keep adding new farm partners in order to continue to boost production.Javeri Kadri has other projects on the horizon, including a new Masala Chai tea blend, another blend developed with the former Top Chef host Padma Lakshmi, and acookbookfeaturing recipes from partner farms. “A lot of people tell me, ‘Oh, Indian food is intimidating or heavy or complicated,’ and the whole premise of the book is, how do we make it as bright and fresh and accessible as possible?” Javeri Kadri said.She plans to roll out these projects while managing an altogether new challenge: This month,Donald Trumpsaid he would raise tariffs on Indian products to 50%, a move that Javeri Kadri predicts will cost her company between $100,000 and $200,000 by the end of the year, leaving her no choice but to eventually raise prices. (She said they had already paid about $20,000 in tariffs since April, when the US imposed its initial levies.)Javeri Kadri’s entire business model is built on sourcing spices from the areas they are indigenous to in south Asia, which means she couldn’t pivot her supply chain even if she wanted to.“People will say, ‘Well, we don’t need those exotic ingredients anyway,’” she said. But, she added, “there’s nothing as American as apple pie. And apple pie relies on cinnamon. An American classic is vanilla ice cream; we don’t grow vanilla. A lot of these ingredients are inherently not exotic, but they come from elsewhere.”Tariffs could have an especially devastating effect on mission-driven companies like Diaspora, which operate on small margins even as they prioritize single-source farms and fair labor, said David Ortega, the Noel W Stuckman chair in food economics and policy at Michigan State University. “These tariff price increases can really jeopardize those priorities.”With the higher tariffs – and the economic uncertainty surrounding trade policy – Javeri Kadri acknowledges that it may be hard to grow in the US market over the coming years. Her approach?“We grow elsewhere. We go where we’re not penalized for doing business,” she said. “It’s very simple.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessThe New Face of Small BusinessTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsSan FranciscoCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It could resemble Samsung’sFlip design– closer to a 2000s-style clamshell phone – or itsFold, more like a foldable iPad.AJPMorgan reporthas suggested that the first foldable iPhone will be revealed in September 2026, priced at $1,999 (£1,474), and will likely expand a foldable phone market expected to reach 19m units in 2025.The rectangular tablet has been a mainstay of phone design for the last 15 years, but could Apple betting on the flip phone be a sign that’s about to change?Tech experts said the new product launch probably reflected the fact that people now mostly access the internet on their phones, rather than laptops or tablets, and are looking for a device that optimises that experience – but the high price point suggests it will remain a premium product.“Apple and all other smartphone makers are somewhat stymied by the fact the smartphone has become somewhat of a boring category – it’s absolutely essential in people’s daily lives, but it no longer has the excitement of the next big thing,” said Ben Wood, an analyst at the tech consultancy CCS Insight.This is why Apple has been reaching for new designs that can get people talking – for example, the ultra-thin iPhone, expected to be launched in September.Wood thinks Apple is entering the foldable market because other companies have experimented first. Samsung’s initial Galaxy Fold designs were bedevilled by screen problems, but next week’s Galaxy Flip and Fold 7 triple release, featuring slimmer designs and bigger screens, is expected to represent the “next generation” of foldable phones, which Samsung will be hoping reversesthe flatlining salesin 2024.“Apple is rarely first to anything – it’s not typically a company that dives in with both feet – it likes to take its time, see how it can refine and optimise it, and deliver the best, most reliable experience, then it jumps,” Wood said.He noted that Samsung’s flip phone has been more popular than the fold model “because it’s cheaper and has captured imagination of the population who like the idea of having something different from everyone else”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This, combined with the fact that young people, especially, tend to use smartphones to go online, suggests that the foldable design could offer an ideal compromise for future consumers.Prof Ben Carter, who researches how smartphones impact our lives at King’s College London, agreed that video watching was “one of the wins” for foldable phones, especially since videos constitute a growing proportion of the content that people consume. Foldable phones can have larger screens and can also be propped up for easier viewing.He thought there could be mental health benefits to a design resembling a “mini-laptop that you can close down”. His research shows that disabling notifications is highly effective in reducing screen time and tackling smartphone addiction.If the screen is not visible, it removes the “variable reward scheme” – the same process by which gambling addiction works, whereby not knowing when you will receive a reward makes something more compelling. “If you can switch it off, more like a laptop, that distraction has gone,” he said, though he noted there waws not yet evidence that people are using foldable phones in this way.This might be especially beneficial for children, who receive on average more than 200 notifications a day – though the high price point of foldable phones makes it unlikely that many will have access to them until their parents pass on secondhand models several years after launch.Prof David Ellis, the chair of behavioural science at the University of Bath, said that other draws include the fact that screens are better protected and fit into a smaller pocket, as well as the “sense of nostalgia that comes with a flip phone”.But he added that it might not be the gamechanger people are expecting: Apple doesn’t have a “100% success rate – theVision Pro[headset] has been a spectacular failure”.Explore more on these topicsAppleMobile phonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Extreme emotions will accompany the champions throughout their title defence but were particularly apt on the night Anfield paid tribute to Diogo Jota and Arne Slot’s side showed the incredible will-to-win that defines them.Mohamed Salah was inconsolable after the final whistle. Moments after sealing an enthralling victory over Bournemouth and recreating Jota’s Baby Shark celebration, the Liverpool forward broke down in tears in front of the Kop as they sang inhonour of the tragic Portugal international. Jota’s wife, Rute Cardoso, children and family had found the strength to be present and were welcomed with a sign that read: ‘Rute, Dinis, Duarte, Matilda – Anfield will always be your home. You’ll Never Walk Alone.’ It was one moving moment among many as Anfield remembered their number 20 and his brother, André Silva, following their deaths in July.Liverpool 4-2 Bournemouth: Premier League season opener – liveRead moreThe headlines could have belonged to Federico Chiesa, who came off the bench to clinch the win and shatterBournemouthwith an 88th-minute volley. It was his first Premier League goal for the club but, given the emotion, the high drama and unfortunately allegations of racist abuse towards Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, Chiesa’s vital contribution may be overlooked. Semenyo scored two excellent goals to haul Andoni Iraola’s team level, and deservedly so, only for Chiesa’s and Salah’s late double act to rescue Liverpool.Hugo Ekitiké,Liverpool’s recent £69m signingfrom Eintracht Frankfurt, impressed on his Premier League debut and opened the scoring. His touch, movement and pace ensured a seamless assimilation into the Liverpool attack but one look at Slot’s substitute bench, where his striking options consisted of Chiesa and 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha, underlined why interest in Alexander Isak remains. For all the additions to the Liverpool ranks and departures from the Bournemouth squad, however, it was the visitors who looked the more enterprising team prior to Ekitiké’s breakthrough.Bournemouth have sold Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi to the powerhouses ofLiverpool, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain respectively this summer for a combined £144.8m. Their absences told defensively, but Iraola will take comfort from the quality of his side’s overall display.Marcos Senesi was fortunate in the extreme to avoid a red card for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity with 13 minutes gone. Attempting to intercept a pass intended for Ekitiké, the Bournemouth central defender miscued a clearance from his thigh on to his fingertips before clawing the ball away from the Liverpool striker, who would have been through on goal. It was a clear handball, so clear that Cody Gakpo picked up the ball to await the inevitable punishment. Instead, referee Anthony Taylor awarded Bournemouth a free-kick for a handball by Gakpo. It was some escape.Slot was further enraged when Taylor waved play on after a trip on Florian Wirtz. Semenyo took possession and avoided a dangerous challenge from Kerkez before being tripped by Alexis Mac Allister. Moments later, as the Bournemouth forward shaped to take a throw-in, a Liverpool fan moved to the front of the Main Stand and berated him. Semenyo informed Taylor he had been racially abused and the game was paused as the match official called over both managers and stewards.

The France under-21 international was coolness personified as he sent Djordje Petrovic to his right and rolled a finish past the keeper’s left. Gakpo doubled the champions’ advantage early in the second half when he received Ekitiké’s pass on the edge of the area and cut across two Bournemouth players before finding the bottom corner.Liverpool were in the comfort zone, and Bournemouth almost made them pay. Semenyo twice punished loose defending – and it had been a feature of their entire performance – to haul the visitors level. The Ghana international was unmarked as he swept home David Brooks’ low centre from the left. There was a sense of inevitability about Bournemouth’s equaliser and it arrived when Salah overhit a pass towards Dominik Szoboszlai. Hamed Traorè intercepted and released Semenyo, who set off from deep inside his own half and did not meet a challenge of note until reaching the edge of the Liverpool penalty area. The forward ended his outstanding run by finding the bottom corner of Alisson’s goal.How Salah made amends. It was his cross that caused pandemonium inside the Bournemouth box and resulted in Chiesa volleying Liverpool back in front. In stoppage time Salah registered his customary opening day goal to put the result beyond doubt with a piercing finish beyond Petrovic. The Egypt international celebrated wildly by his standards. The tears that followed underlined the importance of this night to all at Liverpool.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Other sanctions include a 25% reduction in official visits for the 2025–26 season, a 14-week ban on recruiting communications, and four years’ probation.Disguises, subterfuge and conspiracy: college football’s sign-stealing scandal explainedRead moreThe controversy dates back to early in the 2023 season, when reports emerged that Michigan’s football program was running a covert sign-stealing operation. In American college football, teams often use hand signals to communicate plays from the sideline, and while deciphering those signals is not against NCAA rules, schools are barred from sending representatives to scout future opponents in person or from using electronic equipment to record signals.According to the NCAA, former staffer Connor Stalions orchestrated a vast off-campus, in-person scouting scheme during the 2021, 2022 and 2023 seasons. Using a network of staff, interns, and acquaintances he dubbed the “KGB,” Stalions purchased and transferred game tickets – spending nearly $35,000 in 2022 alone – so others could film future opponents’ signal callers from the stands. The footage, which Stalions referred to as “dirty film”, was then used to decode thousands of signals, information he shared with prominent coaching staff members. Evidence included ticket receipts, transfer data, and witness testimony.The NCAA documented 56 scouting instances covering 52 games against 13 future opponents. Stalions also attended at least one future opponent’s game himself. Investigators said the full scope and advantage gained “will never be known” because of the deliberate destruction and withholding of materials, including Stalions admitting he disposed of his phone – and possibly film – in a pond.The scandal led to multiple failures to cooperate. Stalions, Harbaugh, Moore and then–director of player personnel Denard Robinson destroyed materials or provided false and misleading information. Moore deleted a 52-message text thread with Stalions the day after the scheme became public, later conceding it was a reaction to the news. Harbaugh refused to provide records or sit for an interview.The investigation also uncovered unrelated recruiting violations, including impermissible benefits to four prospects and nearly 100 impermissible recruiting messages before allowable dates. Those violations were attributed to several former assistants, including Jesse Minter, Steve Clinkscale and Chris Partridge, as well as Robinson.The NCAA classified the scouting and most cooperation failures as Level I violations – its most severe – and the recruiting and “failure to monitor” charges as Level II. The panel concluded Michigan’s compliance staff was rebuffed, dismissed and disregarded by Harbaugh’s program, creating “a culture of noncompliance”.Stalions received an eight-year show-cause order; Harbaugh a 10-year show-cause beginning in 2028; Robinson a three-year show-cause. Moore, now head coach, was given a two-year show-cause and a three-game suspension, with one game to be served in 2026 after Michigan’s self-imposed two-game ban in 2025.Despite Michigan’s status as a “repeat violator” and the case’s Level I–Aggravated classification – grounds for a multi-year postseason ban – the panel chose financial penalties instead, saying a ban would unfairly punish current players for the actions of former coaches and staff.Michigan open the 2025 season at home against New Mexico on 30 August. Moore will serve his suspension after the 6 September game at Oklahoma, missing matchups with Central Michigan and Nebraska. Whether he will appeal the additional 2026 game remains unclear.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsMichiganUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The concept lured in top names, including British Olympic sprinters Daryll Neita and Matthew Hudson-Smith, and 1500m world champion Josh Kerr, with the promise of swift payouts and a bold new stage for elite sprinting and middle-distance races.The season began with meets in Kingston, Miami and Philadelphia, though the latter was trimmed from three days to two as costs mounted. The finale in Los Angeles, scheduled for June, wascancelled altogetherafter organizers failed to secure promised investment. Johnson said the move was designed “to avoid further losses” and begin the “lengthy process of stabilizing the company to get back on track”.“It is incredibly difficult to live with the reality that you’ve built something bigger than yourself while simultaneously feeling like you’ve let down the very people you set out to help,” Johnsonsaid in a statementon Friday. “We promised that athletes would be fairly and quickly compensated.

Johnson blamed the crisis on “circumstances beyond our control” after committed funding failed to materialize, but insisted the league had no plans to fold.Instead, he said, Grand Slam is “putting systems and partnerships in place” to ensure such a breakdown never happens again. “While I am no stranger to setbacks and overcoming obstacles, this current situation of not being able to pay our athletes and partners has been one of the most difficult challenges I’ve ever experienced. The 2026 season will not happen until these obligations are met – and that is my number one priority.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But many believe MLS is more interested in its own position than the wellbeing of fansAlexander AbnosFri 15 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 05.02 EDTShareThe man in the Make America Great Again hat could not have been more direct.“I’m being evicted from the premises because we can’t wear Donald Trump hats in public,” he said to his camera from the stands at a St Louis City game in late July. A security official lingered in the background, asking him to leave as he delivered his next line: “Trump is not welcome here.”The man, Michael Weitzel, is a season ticket holder who was eventually led outside the gates of the stadium as the security official told him that he sympathized, that he was a “Trumper” too, but that he had to follow policy.Weitzel’s video is fairly tame, as these things go – the situation never escalates beyond a somewhat exasperated conversation. It went viral nonetheless, with a parade of influencers and publications that don’t ordinarily pay much attention to Major League Soccer suddenly taking a very keen interest in what seemed to be a landmark one-sided enforcement against political speech. Some even called it a first amendment issue – which it isn’t, because the first amendment concerns government action andMLSis a private business.What it is, though, is the latest of a long line of incidents to shine a spotlight on MLS’s fan code of conduct, which has banned political displays in some form for much of the league’s history. Regardless of wording, the policy has seemingly always been a controversy magnet. It is also emblematic of one of MLS’s foundational challenges as it pursues its goal of being one of the top leagues of the world – how to live up to both the norms of global soccer, and those of major American sports leagues, even when the two are wildly different.League commissionerDon Garber defendedthe policy earlier this year when asked by the Guardian aboutanti-Ice signsand banners that were confiscated at various games – actions that have caused a revolt among multiple supporters’ groups.“We want our stadiums to stay safe,” Garber said. “We want to ensure that we’re having displays that are not going to incite anyone, and at the same time not take care of one audience, and at the same time having to deal with another audience that might be on the other side of this issue. The best way to do that is to have the policy we have.”MLS has discouraged political displays in its fan code of conduct for many years, with theremoval of banners reading “Refugees welcome”from a Toronto FC game in 2015 standing as an early example. The league’spolicyat the time simply asked fans to create an environment “free from … political or inciting messages”. A new wording, institutedat the start of the 2019 season, was slightly more specific, banning the use of “political … language and/or gestures”. In each case, MLS, its clubs, and the security officials hired for each game were given a wide berth to determine what was and was not political. This was swiftly identified as a problem by the Independent Supporters’ Council (ISC), an organization representing the league’s supporters’ groups.“We, as an organization, feel strongly on ensuring that displays of human rights are not mistaken for political statements,”a 2019 ISC statementread in part. “Political engagement is sometimes necessary in securing human rights for all, but that does not make the message of human rights inherently political.”From the World Cup logo to new club crests, soccer designs are losing an edgeRead moreThe statement turned out to be prescient. Months after it was issued, the league drew the ire of several groups bybanning the displayof the “Iron Front” symbol, a logo featuring a trio of encircled arrows pointing diagonally downward. The symbol was first used by an anti-Nazi paramilitary group during the second world war. It is now a lesser-known but graphically impactful way of expressing anti-fascist sentiment. MLS determined that the symbol represented a political movement (antifa), and banned it. The fans resisted. Within months,the ban was dropped, and the policy changed to the version that rules the league today. This version outlaws “electioneering, campaigning or advocating for or against any candidate, political party, legislative issue, or government action.”The new language seemed like it might have clarified things by inserting more specific language. Yet situations like Weitzel’s, or the anti-Ice banner removals, or the New England Revolution’sremoval of a “Free Rumeysa” banner, continue to raise questions about the scope of the policy, and how it is best enforced.“I think it’s a quite confusing and unclear rule,” said Emerson Sykes, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU, who is a soccer fan and has researched MLS’s policy and its recent headline-grabbing controversies. “I think when you apply these rules to these different situations, the problem with vague rules comes into play, specifically the issue of consistent enforcement. So there’s the rule and then there’s how it’s actually experienced by folks. The same banner in one place might not mean the same thing in another place and that’s just the nature of speech and what makes it very difficult to enforce these kinds of rules. That’s why we really don’t let the government do it. This is a private entity, so they’re allowed to do it, but some of the same pitfalls show up.”MLS, for its part, is aware of the difficulty of enforcement across 30 teams in 28 cities spanning two countries, in venues where different private security companies may be making the decisions on the ground. A source with knowledge of the league’s thinking on the policy, who was granted anonymity to protect relationships within the game, told the Guardian that league officials believe the St Louis situation could have been handled differently, but that they consider it and other headline-grabbing situations like it to be the exception rather than the norm.Still, it’s hard to imagine that situations like that won’t come up again, especially amid the second Trump administration’s headlong dive into authoritarianism. The United States’ political candidates, legislative issues, and actions increasingly have a direct impact on MLS’s own fans – perhaps moreso than at any point in the history of the league. This is especially true of Hispanic and Latin American communities that MLS has previously estimated comprise about 30% of its fanbase. These are communities whichhave been the target of repeated raids by Ice, and who have been specifically demonized by Trump and his most senior advisers.In MLS, though, fans and officials must walk a tightrope. The source familiar with MLS’s thinking said that often, an acceptable fan display comes down to framing. “Abolish Ice,” the source said, is a message that the league considers to have nothing to do with the game, does not overlap with human rights, and is a straightforwardly adversarial political statement. The Nashville SC supporters’ banner reading “We’re not all here,” meanwhile, is deemed to be acceptable – a reference to the fact that Ice is affecting the community of fans in the stands, without referencing the agency directly. Similarly, they said that while the league would most likely consider an anti-supreme court message in the wake of the overturning Roe v Wade to have been against policy, a banner that read “abortion is healthcare” would be deemed more acceptable.Ultimately, the source stressed that the league’s focus above all else is on risk management on a game-by-game basis. Political messages, which can be inciting on their own, can get taken to a new level in the middle of the heightened emotions of a full stadium, where alcohol is commonplace and judgements are impaired as a result.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am in no way discouraging or disparaging athlete activists, they are some of my favorite people in history, but I do understand why a league would be hesitant to have their stadium and their games become political side shows. At some level it’s inescapable because politics is everywhere, identities are everywhere, but it is not a political forum. It is not a political debate. It’s not a political rally. It’s a sporting event and so it’s understandable that some different rules might apply.”MLS is in regular communication with the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL about security procedures, yet the league is an outlier even among those North American men’s major leagues. All have fan codes of conduct either league-wide or for individual teams, but few of those codes of conduct mention politics – and when they do, it’s often specifically about banning political signs or banners, not a blanket ban on political displays. Among the most popular women’s leagues, the NWSL’s fan code of conduct closely mirrors that of MLS. The WNBA’s doesn’t mention politics.Elsewhere in soccer, none of Europe’s five major men’s soccer leagues (the Premier League, Serie A, Bundesliga, La Liga and Ligue 1) have an official policy concerning political speech from fans, though individual clubs may. For some clubs, political displays from fans are expectedor even encouraged, with traditions dating back generations. But comparisons are difficult, in part because of how the game has evolved with most clubs around the world, which were often founded as cultural institutions, while MLS and every other North American major sports league have only ever intended to be business-first.“The norms around fan conduct very so widely across countries and across leagues,” Sykes points out. “It can be difficult to draw any direct lines and it’s really so context specific – what MLS thinks is going to be inciting versus what is actually inciting is one question but also what’s going to be inciting in one stadium and one city or in one league might be very different from another.”Aside from the NWSL, MLS’s political policy falls most closely in line with entities that oversee international soccer: Concacaf, Uefa, Caf, the AFC, OFC and Fifa. In each of those cases, the confederations have faced numerous allegations of inconsistency. This was most recently notable in Qatar for the 2022 World Cup, whereReutersand other outlets reported that stadium security allowed fans wearing “Free Palestine” shirts into games, while removing those who wore shirts supporting Iran’s “Woman, life freedom” protests.In both of those cases, the line between the political actions of a government and a human rights issue is blurred. In the United States in 2025 it is much the same. “Make America Great Again” is of course associated closely with one particular political figure, but you’d be hard-pressed to argue it isn’t a social and cultural movement as well (not to mention the fact that Trump is no longer a candidate for office, as Sykes points out, thus theoretically making him exempt from MLS’s policy). Ice is a government entity empowered by legislation, but people are protesting its actions, whichjust one report links to at least 510 credible human rights violations.Multiple MLS officials who spoke on background for this piece stressed that the process of enforcing the policy is collective between the clubs, supporters’ groups, security and the league office, but it’s still unclear if there is a way to enforce MLS’s no politics rule without occasionally curtailing the ability of fans to speak out in favor of human rights.It also opens up plenty of room for hypocrisy. MLS has banned both Israeli and Palestinian flags from its venues, with special dispensation given in the case of an Israeli or Palestinian players’ presence on a roster, and usually only when displayed in a supporters’ section and hung from the stadium. The ban on political speech has been used as justification for this. Yet the US flag, representing a country that is responsible for no shortage of geopolitically fraught conflicts, gets a moment in the spotlight at nearly every game with the playing of the national anthem, a tradition across all North American major sports leagues. Political statements as passive as wearing a hat or holding a banner might get a fan kicked out of an MLS game, but team owners maydonate many millions of dollarsto political candidates and Pacs without consequence.MLS could rescind its policy or leave it up to individual clubs, but doing so could open the door to any number of conflicts between fans in an era of heightened political tension, in a culture unused to those sorts of things happening at sporting events, with a president who will seize upon it for personal gain. In the minds of MLS, this not only makes games less safe, it also would bring the league further from the financial and cultural juggernauts of the nation’s other sports leagues – a unique factor that few other domestic soccer competitions in the world deal with in quite the same way.Ultimately, one source said, MLS is more concerned with its own position than its fans’ beliefs.Explore more on these topicsMLSUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Governance failures, and a troubled safeguarding record, could cost the US more than podium places at LA 2028Fri 15 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 08.14 EDTShareIn three years’ time, the swimming programme for the Los Angeles Olympics will unfold over nine days and nights on the grandest stage the sport has ever known. A purpose-built pool inside SoFi Stadium in Inglewood will be the centerpiece ofa 38,000-capacity open-air natatorium, transforming the $5bn home of the NFL’s Rams and Chargers into what’s said to be the largest swimming venue in history. For the United States, a rare Summer Games on home soil should be a coronation, a chance to showcase the depth of its talent in the country’s most spectacular arena. Yet Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of them all, fears the US swimming program is in no shape to seize the moment.Phelpshas launched a withering attackon USA Swimming’s leadership, accusing it of “weak” stewardship, “poor operational controls” and presiding over years of organizational drift. The 23-times Olympic gold medalist said he would think twice about letting his own sons join the system in its current state. His concerns, he says, stretch back to his own competitive career, when athlete voices were too often brushed aside in the name of keeping the peace and presenting a united front. “This isn’t on the athletes,” he wrotein a lengthy Instagram statement. “This is on the leadership of USA Swimming.”The decline he sees is cultural and structural as much as competitive. In 2016, Phelps was part of a US swim team in Rio that, by his measure, was “arguably the most successful in the sport’s history”, winning 57% of the medals available in the pool. Eight years later in Paris, that share fell to 44% – the lowest for Team USA since the 1988 Olympics – a downtick he cites as evidence the cracks in the system have widened. An open letter he sent earlier this year to USASwimming, co-signed by other medallists, world record holders, coaches and staff, was, he says, ignored. His prescription is sweeping: an independent review of the board, improved athlete services and renewed grassroots investment to reverse flagging membership.Other greats share his alarm. The 12-times Olympic medalist Ryan Lochterecently posted a meme, also shared by Phelps, likening USA Swimming to an interred corpse, while three-time Olympic champion and NBC analyst Rowdy Gaines has gone public with his concernsin an op-ed for Swimming World magazine. Gaines calls the organization’s year-long absence of a CEO a “leadership void” at the worst possible time. He warns that even thetable-topping nine gold medalswon at this summer’s world championships in Singapore – despite the severegastroenteritis outbreakthat badly compromised the US team – should not mask “deeper structural issues under the surface”. Both men see LA 2028 as a deadline: the last chance to repair the system before the lights go up in Inglewood.View image in fullscreenMichael Phelps competes at the 2016 Rio Olympics, where the United States won 57% of the medals available in the pool. That share dropped to 44% last year in Paris.Photograph: François-Xavier Marit/AFP/Getty ImagesNotably, Phelps’s broadside does not directly address the most damaging area of USA Swimming’srecent history: its handling of sexual abuse, harassment and athlete safeguarding. Earlier this year, incoming CEO Chrissi Rawak resigned after just nine days when the organization learned of an undisclosed SafeSport complaint against her from her coaching days. The US Center for SafeSport itself, which handles such allegations, has been in anongoing state of turmoil: its own chief executive was dismissed amid scrutiny of hiring practices, including an investigatorwho himself was later chargedwith multiple sex crimes, including rape, sex trafficking and soliciting prostitution. Survivors have reported retraumatization through flawed investigations, and their trust in both SafeSport and USA Swimming’s vetting processes remains fragile at best, if not fractured beyond repair.These controversies form the unspoken backdrop to Phelps’s and Gaines’s governance concerns. Their focus is on performance, leadership and resources, but the weaknesses they describe – poor oversight, slow action, lack of accountability – are the same flaws critics have long identified in the organization’s handling of abuse cases. If USA Swimming cannot convincingly address either set of problems, the sport risks arriving at the once-in-a-lifetime platform of a home Games with not only a competitive deficit, but a deficit of credibility.A home Olympics is an exceptional and defining moment for any sport. For American swimming, LA 2028 offers the chance to inspire a new generation, boost grassroots participation and cement the sport’s place in a crowded US sporting landscape. It is also, as Gaines notes, a one-shot opportunity: miss it and the momentum may be lost for decades. That is why the absence of a clear vision, not least a permanent leader, concerns those who understand both the stakes and the clock. SoFi Stadium may promise the grandest stage in Olympic history, but whether USA Swimming will be ready for it remains an open question.Explore more on these topicsSwimmingMichael PhelpsLA Olympic Games 2028USA Olympic teamRyan LochteUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Every decision relating to her career has been dissected and debated. The most banal details surrounding her personal life have been transfigured into headline news. In order to find herself on and off the tennis court, Raducanu has had to learn how to tune out the noise, which at times can be deafening.Only one month ago at Wimbledon, the discourse surrounding the 22-year-old reached diabolical lows. Even though her on-court performances were strong, it was impossible to escape the speculation surrounding her personal life. In the bowels of Center Court at the Cincinnati Open, I offer my own blunt perspective: I have never cringed as much as I did while watching people trying to pry into her romantic relationships at the All England Club. “Yeah, and Cam’s questions, too,” Raducanu responds, laughing. “That was terrible.Terrible.”She was referring to her compatriot Cameron Norrie’s post-match press conference, when a reporter asked him whether he was dating Raducanu. Norrie, who was being supported in his player box that day by his long-term partner, was as baffled as he was bemused. For Raducanu, though, such brazen intrusiveness from strangers has simply become part of her everyday life. “I know, I know,” she says, smiling. “I guess it comes with the territory, people being so curious. I think they’re more curious about this news than any tennis results and tennis news. But I just keep to myself, my private life to one side. It’s always funny when people try to find something out, but I try not to read into it so much.”That curiosity is not isolated to the internet and tabloids. When Raducanu is out in London, paparazzi will find her, even when she is doing nothing more than stepping on to a 345 bus somewhere in Wandsworth. “It’s really freaky, because you don’t know they’re there. And then you’ll see a photo of yourself the next day, and you’ll be like: ‘There’s no way they were there,’” she says.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu with the US Open trophy in 2021.Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPAConsidering her well-documented encounters with stalkers – one was arrested andhanded a five-year restraining orderafter stealing items from her front door in 2021 and another fixated person followed her across four different countries earlier this year – Raducanu has genuine concerns regarding her safety: “After theDubai incident, that was probably the worst [public attention] I’ve had,” she says. “I remember straight afterwards, I found it very difficult going out. I definitely had a bit of a leftover lag effect. But I’ve been a lot more astute, a lot more, I’d say, safe and I have someone with me. I don’t really go out on my own as much. No solo walks. Just always having someone watching my back.”Everything leads back to those three fateful weeks at the US Open in the summer of 2021, where Raducanu became the first qualifier to win a grand slam title in the open era. The spoils of victory were significant but Raducanu’s rapid success yielded considerable challenges. Along with the difficult results and constant criticism, her body constantly betrayed her. In 2023, after struggling physically for a long time, she underwent surgeries on both wrists and her left ankle.While she tried to prove herself on the court, Raducanu says, people within her team would tell her she was not tough. “I was obviously, like: ‘Oh, no, Iamtough enough,’” she says. “It wasn’t good to hear, because I always prided myself on being a hard worker and being tough. And I believe I am. I actually think it was more the people around me that were incorrect, and it led me to having three surgeries and double wrist surgery. I was overtraining and just covering it up, not saying I was in pain, even when I was. So it was really tough to hear. But as I’ve grown with experience, I kind of realised my body a bit more and trusted myself a bit more.”Mentally, things were even more challenging. As she failed to follow up her breakthrough victory with similar results, there were times when her mind twisted her US Open triumph into a negative memory, the source of her struggles. It was not until this year that she understood how to focus on her improvement and daily work, however gradual, rather than comparing every result with the 2021 US Open. Still, it remains a work in progress. “It’s [comparisons to the US Open] something that never fully leaves you,” Raducanu says. “I think it’s been four years now, I don’t think it’s fully gone away. Maybe in a few years, maybe when I’m older, more mature, but it’s hard to put that aside completely. It’s always in the back of your mind, but it’s more just being aware of those thoughts and then not letting it crash your day or ruin the work that you’re doing, and bringing it back to what I’m doing now, and the process.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve tried,” she says. “I’ve obviously been recommended to do it a lot, with what I went through. It was something that not many people, well actually, no one has gone through, which is probably the reason I did two sessions and I stopped. I was like: ‘Look, these guys, they don’t relate.’ And, to be honest, no other athlete has done what I’ve done, so I don’t know why I’m taking advice from them. So I was like: ‘OK, well, the only person who can help me is myself.’”For a long time the four defining cities of Raducanu’s life were listed in her biographies across her social media platforms. Her parents, Ion and Renee, originally come from Bucharest, Romania, and Shenyang, China, respectively while she was born in Toronto, Canada, and grew up in London, England. Her mother’s solo immigration from China to Canada has been an inspirational tale throughout her life. “I would say it’s funny when people ask where you’re from,” she says. “Obviously, I feel British. I’ve grown up there, But there are certain things, the way I think, I don’t think I am completely. So you have a little question about your identity. But I try not to read too much into it and try to just take the best from all the different worlds that I’ve been exposed to and grown up in.”Regardless of the subject at hand, Raducanu frequently notes the support and significance of her parents. She describes her upbringing as rigid and strict, but their tough love has made her the person she is today. “I was always brought up with really high standards, high expectations of myself, not much sympathy,” says Raducanu. “So when I was younger, that was tough, and even now. But I think it really shaped me to be the player I am, the person I am; pretty down to earth. They never got impressed by anything glitzy or high or anything.”View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu during her narrow defeat by Aryna Sabalenka in the Cincinnati Open.Photograph: Dylan Buell/Getty ImagesBoth Raducanu’s parents worked in finance and they passed on their numerical, logical mindsets. Over the past few years, however, part of her evolution as an adult has been understanding herself as a person. Her injury layoff in 2023, which initially seemed like a catastrophe, turned out to be essential for her personal development. Raducanu spent her time away from tennis travelling, including a long trip to China, trying different hobbies and gradually learning more about herself. She learned that she is also creative, which has significantly influenced her playing style on the court. “I kind of discovered the more artistic side – the piano, the painting, the reading, the philosophy, all of those things,” she says. “I really think it opened my eyes to another world. Now I’m kind of seeing how I can find an area where those two intersect, and have the creative side but also have the quantitative side.”With age and experience, Raducanu also has a greater understanding of her preferences when making general decisions. While discussing her decision making, Raducanu’s mind shifts to another source of criticism: her coaching history. “I’m a lot more clear on what I do and don’t like,” she says. “The experiences that I’ve had with different coaches … People love to say I’ve had so many different coaches but if I went into the details of a lot of them, people would not be saying the same thing. I just don’t do that, because I don’t want to “out” these people. So I keep it to myself.”Is it ever tempting? “When you see things like: ‘Oh, Emma on herninthcoach’, I’m like: ‘Guys, come on.’ Certain ones don’t count. If you’ve had a trial, you don’t have to carry on after the trial. A few have been trials, a few have been other situations. I just try and take the high road,” she says. Then she laughs. “And try to do what the royal family would do.”After years of rolling with the punches and gradually coming to understand herself, Raducanu seems to finally be in a positive place again. She speaks effusively about the great enjoyment she has found in her consistent daily work and she has thrown herself into becoming the best player she can be each day. Raducanu’s results are reflective of that shift and her ranking is on the rise. Her time in Cincinnati, her first week with her new coach, Francisco Roig, ended with acolossal three-hour battlewith Aryna Sabalenka, the world No 1, where she narrowly lost 7-6 (5) in the final set. Over the next few days, she will return to New York for the US Open more self-assured than she has been since she won the title.Our second conversation ends with a final question on Raducanu’s ambitions for the next few years beyond her results. After a beat, she shrugs. The hope, she says, is that the passion and joy she now feels each day about her daily work will endure. “I want to continue for the next few years to just keep enjoying because I would rather not do anything else or be anywhere else,” she says. “I see my friends, like, somewhere in the south of France, and they’re chilling on a boat or whatever, and I’m just like: ‘OK, well, it looks amazing,’ but when I’m putting in double session practices with the people around laughing, that fills me up so much more. So I’m really happy to have gotten to this place and [I want] to just continue that.”Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

It will be a proud moment for all but perhaps none will deserve it more than the part-timers who have to juggle playing rugby with jobs outside the sport to make ends meet.Among many diverse life stories are the tales of three props: the Canadian firefighter Olivia DeMerchant, the Brazilian tattoo artist and animator Samara Vergara, and the Samoan property manager and mother of four Denise Aiolupotea.Flashing mouthgards for concussion to be introduced at Women’s Rugby World CupRead moreAiolupotea, who plays in New Zealand for the Hurricanes at club level, has had financial help from her family to achieve her World Cup dream given the non-professional status of the Samoa team. Additional support from her husband and family has enabled her to prepare while juggling a full-time job in a packed schedule.“A typical week when we are at home and not in camp, I get up to train at 5am, get home and sort the kids out for school, go and do my day of work and come home,” says Aiolupotea. “If there’s after-school things I tend to that but there’s also training in the evening as well.“We have a makeshift home gym, so it’s easily accessible if I need to be at home and can’t get out to the gym. I have to squeeze it in whenever I can. It doesn’t end at the weekends. I have to do game replacements or recovery to make sure my body is in a position to start another week.”Aiolupotea admits it is “financially challenging” but worth it as “the jersey means a lot more”. She adds: “I take all the opportunities I can get and my family are so proud to have someone go to the World Cup, it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity for me so it’s something I couldn’t give up.View image in fullscreenSamoa’s Denise Aiolupotea attempts to get past Volatiana Rasoanandrasana of Madagascar during the WXV 3 2024 match.Photograph: Christopher Pike/World Rugby/Getty Images“I really wanted to be a part of it after being part of the Dubai team who qualified [at WXV 3]. It’s definitely a challenge and not easy being away from home, we miss milestones and the children miss us like crazy, but they are also so proud to see us on that world stage.”DeMerchant, who will be paid by Canada during the World Cup, has been a firefighter since 2023 and will be competing at her fourth tournament.Before her first World Cup, she did “odds and ends” jobs to fit around rugby before moving to a physio clinic and then firefighting. “I really like the team aspect of firefighting,” says DeMerchant, who plays for Halifax Tars and previously had a spell at Exeter Chiefs. “I really like working with others for the same goal. Problem solving with firefighting is something that is really valid. I like helping my community, I enjoy working as a team and problem solving is something that is always fun.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was unable to compete in the Pacific Four Series in May, against the US, New Zealand and Australia, because she could not get the time off. It has taken a lot of organisation around her shifts to travel to England for the World Cup.“My employer was really great, I told my chiefs what I planned to do and they were pretty supportive,” she says. “I am working a lot in October and November when I get back but I think I had to have 21 days off, I used all of my vacation time, time in lieu that I had built up and a lot of switches with co-workers.”Brazil’s Vergara is part of the first South American squad to qualify for a Women’s Rugby World Cup. She diversified her income after the pandemic, adding tattooing alongside her animation work. She has long balanced work with sport having been a muay thai fighter before switching to rugby in 2017.View image in fullscreenSamara Vergara sports a Stitch tattoo as well as tattooing clients and some of her international teammates.Photograph: FotojumpVergara, who plays for Pasteur in São Paulo, is self-employed, which makes scheduling easier but more stressful in other areas. She will receive some pay from the Brazilian union during the tournament but says: “I won’t lie, it’s not easy. There’s always the worry that I might not find a temporary job that fits with the athletic schedule. So it’s very, very hard but we do what we have to do. It’s really hard. Sometimes I have to prioritise rugby because we have a lot of training sessions and physiotherapy. It’s difficult.”Vergara, who recently tattooed some of her international teammates, says it can take a toll on her mental health but that Brazil have psychologists to support the players. The prop speaks to other players who are in a similar position.Such an experience is common across the tournament. All three players, and many like them, balance early mornings, late nights, work and training. Their stories reflect a sport moving towards full professionalism. Though they come from different countries and careers, they arrive in England with a shared goal: competing for the World Cup.Explore more on these topicsSportWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025Women's rugby unionRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Adams’s first British title was in 1989 at age 17, still the youngest ever, but in the next 20 years he concentrated on the world championship, coming within a hair’s breadth of a reunification match with Garry Kasparov in 2004 before losing in the Fide final.Starting with 2010, Adams made the British championship his priority, and he won five crowns in the next decade. Literally so, for the event trophy has been in the shape of a crown since the very first championship in 1904, and engravers now struggle to find space on it to add new names.View image in fullscreenMichael Adams with the British Championship trophyPhotograph: Yuri Krylov/English Chess FederationBetween 2010 and 2019 Adams won the British title five times, setting up his current record attempt. He still retains his international ambitions, is the reigning world over-50 champion, and is competing in the strongRubinstein Memorialbeginning on Friday at Polanica-Zdroj, Poland.Two titles are still required before Adams can surpass the 10 championships of the late Penrose, and that may be difficult. A new generation of talents is emerging in England, encouraged by a £1.5m support grant over three years for elite talents announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, last month. The funding, which will start in April 2026, will be split equally between the Department for Education and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.The pre-tournament favourite and top seed was Nikita Vitiugov, but the former Russian champion struggled to find his best form and wasdefeated decisivelyby Stuart Conquest in the final round, in an encounter which was awarded the joint best game prize.The 2025 championship was keenly fought, with six players sharing the lead at the start of round nine. Adamswon after a speed tie-breakwith fellow veteran Conquest, 58. Final leading scores were Adams, Conquest, and Peter Roberson (eliminated in the first round of tie-breaks) 7/9, Gawain Maroroa Jones, Svyatoslav Bazakutsa (Ukraine), and Jonah Willow 6.5.View image in fullscreen3985:IM Siva Mahadevan v GM Nikita Vitiugov, British Championship, Liverpool 2025.Black to move and win.The championship marked a breakthrough for junior talent. England’s youngest ever grandmaster Shreyas Royal, 17, was among the leaders for seven rounds, including anelegant winagainst Marcus Harvey, before falling into a trapagainst Conquest.Bodhana Sivanandan, 10, continues to break records. The Harrow primary schoolgirl, who at eight won three world girls gold medals with a combined total of 33 straight wins, achieved her third and final norm for the WIM title with a 2300 rating performance, a full year younger than the previous record.In the final round, Sivanandan became the youngest girl ever to defeat a grandmaster in a classical game when GM Peter Wellsoverstepped the time limitin a lost position.At 10 years five months, Sivanandan was six months younger than the previous world record holder, Carissa Yip of the US, who defeated GM Alexander Ivanov at the 2014 New England Open (not 2019, as widely misquoted) aged 10 years 11 months. Yip has been the US woman champion for the past two years.

The Surrey 11-year-old achieved hisfirst international master norm, easily a UK age record, defeated two grandmasters in succession, and displayed remarkable maturity and stamina, including drawing a 145-move game.Banerjee is again in action this week at theKingston Invitationalorganised by the Guardian’s Stephen Moss followed immediately by theNorthumbria Mastersin Newcastle. It is a tough schedule for an 11-year-old. TheMindsports Internationalis also under way in London.There was criticism of the British Championship format after round eight of nine came with 28 players, more than a quarter of the field, separated by just a single point. Possible remedies are to restore an 11-round championship, with two extra double round days early on; and/or raising the rating floor for entries. However, Alex Holowczak, the influential EnglishChessFederation director of events, has said: “I see one round per day as sacrosanct for the British.”The prize money (Adams received £4,400) is low for an era in which life-changing amounts are on offer for international chess events. When the government grant for elite talent becomes available, it would be reasonable to earmark at least £25,000 to boost the national championship prize money at the University of Warwick in August 2026.In 1954,first prize in the British Championshipwas £35 and second was £15.

The 27-year-old has been accused of caring more about playing for Argentina and was linked with a move to Atlético Madrid this summer but Frank is confident the centre-back’s long-term future lies in north London.Premier League: 10 things to look out for on the opening weekendRead more“I’ve worked with him closely for more than five weeks; I’ve seen a very, very committed player who’s trained very well,” the Spurs manager said. “The staff have said to me they’ve never seen him train that well. He’s in a very good place. I see a player that will want to lead the team and push the team.”Frank was asked whether giving Romero the armband was potentially the first step towards the player extending his contract, which expires in two years. “Yes,” he said. “But I think when you name a captain it’s because you think he’s the best that can help the team no matter what now and also in the future. It’s not really linked with the contract situation. Of course he’s a very good player so I want him to stay longer.”Romero has lacked consistency at times but Frank is convinced of his quality. “I see a very big and very good player. What I like about him and why I have chosen him as captain is his leadership qualities on the pitch. There is a big respect for him from the players. Off the pitch as well he also sets the standards.“When I was 27 of course I thought I could do everything but I also found out that as a leader I am 1,000% better now, so he also needs to learn and become better and better, so I will do my best to guide him. His aggression is phenomenal. He is fantastic in the duels. When he gives that to the team, he can transform the team and give energy to the team so I think that’s extremely important.”Spurs impressedagainst Paris Saint-Germain in the Super Cup finalon Wednesday, taking a 2-0 lead before losing on penalties. They have a quick turnaround before hosting Burnley on Saturday in Frank’s first league game but the Dane believes that the Dutch centre-back Micky van de Ven, who had fitness problems last season, can handle two games a week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The investigation came to light in August 2023, ending the Brazilian’s hopes of joining Manchester City that month, and had the potential to end the 27-year-old’s career.Premier League 2025-26 preview No 19: West Ham UnitedRead moreConfirmation of a regulatory commission finding the case against Paquetá to be not provedarrived last month. The Brazil international, who joined West Ham for £51m three years ago, has gone on to perform wellin pre-seasonand Potter senses that the former Lyon player’s mood has been lifted by no longer being under suspicion.“I think he’s done really well,” West Ham’s head coach said. “Admirable in terms of how he dealt with the situation. Like any human being there are good days and bad. But he’s managed to stay relatively consistent throughout it all. I think there’s a weight lifted off him. He’s been fighting for his career, essentially. When that’s away, then you get a lighter version.”It is unsurprising that Paquetá’s performances dipped after he was charged. He looked unfocused at times and was dropped at the end of last season. His talent is not in doubt though, and Potter is pleased to have him available. West Ham have no intention of selling Paquetá.“We’re delighted to have him,” Potter said. “We’re delighted that what’s been hanging over him has been cleared. It’s been an incredible test for him and the support he’s had from his family and from his teammates and from the club has been incredible. I’m sure he’ll say the same. But for Lucas it’s been a tough time.“He’s a player that we understand, we love, his quality is incredible. Our challenge is to help him bring that out to the best of his ability, to fit with what we’re trying to do. If we can do that he’s a massive asset for us.”West Ham, who open with a trip to Sunderland on Saturday afternoon, have made four signings and are looking to buy two midfielders. They are reluctant to return with an improved offer for Southampton’s Mateus Fernandes, whose £60m valuation is deemed unrealistic.Potter is not working with a big budget and stressed the need to remain compliant with profitability and sustainability regulations but insisted West Ham were capable of playing exciting football even if they do not add more energy and creativity in midfield.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

Yet, behind a resolutely brave face, even Newcastle’s manager acknowledges, albeit tacitly, that he has lost control of the situation.The Sweden striker is so keen to force through a move to Liverpool that he has, in effect, gone on strike. After resisting overtures to be reintegrated with the squad,Isak continues to train aloneand, it is understood, will shortly be fined the maximum permissible two weeks’ wages for making himself unavailable for Saturday’s season opener at Aston Villa.“I’ve said many times I want Alex to train and play,” Howe said on Friday. “I’ve had those conversations with him.” Pressed on whether Isak could rejoin the squad before the end of this month, he shrugged. “I don’t know,” he said. “Alex will control that.”So how did it come to this? Isak, disgruntled at not receiving the pay rise he believed he had been promised during the summer of 2024, left plenty of clues about his mindset last season. In an BBC interview with Alan Shearer last winter and then before the Carabao Cup final the 25-year-old was noncommittal, to say the least, about his future.It would be inconceivable to think a manager as tuned-in as Howe would not have second-guessed his leading scorer’s disillusion. In perhaps the most revealing moment of Friday’s press conference he was asked whether, when Newcastle sealed Champions League qualification in May, he was confident of Isak fulfilling the three remaining years on his contract.“I was not thinking of any individual in that moment, so I can’t really give an answer on that,” he said.View image in fullscreenEddie Howe said of the standoff with Isak: ‘No situation is ever as simple as it seems on the outside.’Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty ImagesThen came a query as to why Newcastle had acted as if blind to Isak’s unhappiness and potential for disruptive behaviour in June. Had they placed the striker on the market then, an auction would surely have unfolded. There would also have been more alternative attacking options for the board to pursue.“I understand why you might think that,” said Howe. “But no situation is ever as simple as it seems on the outside.”It rather provokes the question as to whether he had embraced reality while Newcastle’s Saudi Arabian owners remained in denial and believed they could keep Isak for at least another year. Technically they can, but unhappy players do not make for harmonious, let alone winning, teams.Howe said of Isak, among other things, skipping the pre-season tour of Singapore and South Korea: “I don’t think it has been healthy for us. I don’t deny that’s been a big challenge. Alex, for me, is one of the best strikers in the world, if not the best. To miss him from your squad leaves a huge gap.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a difficult period for us. There was nothing I could do to affect that.“When you have a player that good who is not part of your group it’s difficult for the other players to fully understand it and to know how to react.“But there’s been an acceptance we have to make the best of the situation; the atmosphere within the group has been very good in the last couple of weeks. I can’t look you in the eye and say it’s brought us closer together, but, sometimes, these things can unify you in a way you didn’t know possible.”For all Isak’s rich attacking talent the road to reintegration is perilous. “I don’t think you can achieve anything with a squad that’s not totally united and keen to represent the club,” said Howe, pointedly. “In order for any player to play well you have to be in that mental place where you want to play. The league’s so hard that, if you’re not there, the games can become very difficult, very quickly.”The problem is that unlessLiverpoolmake an offer somewhere nearer Newcastle’s £150m valuation of Isak than the £110m they have had rejected, the club is unlikely to sanction a sale.Liverpool are not expected to bid again until Newcastle sign at least one replacement.A deal for Brentford’s Yoane Wissa is close, but, for the moment, Howe is without a specialist striker. He will field a winger, Anthony Gordon, out of position at centre-forward against Villa.“Alex’s situation’s not in my hands,” he said before turning typically diplomatic. “But I’ll go with whatever hand I’m dealt.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HoweLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 26-year-old is available after Luis Enrique, the PSG coach, signed Lucas Chevalier from Lille to replace the Italy No 1.After 17 years at the top, a tough job is taking a toll on Pep Guardiola | Jonathan WilsonRead moreAt the Club World Cup in June Ederson described speculation regarding leaving City as “99% fake news” but he is now weighing up a transfer, with Galatasaray a potential suitor. City want him to stay and have not received any approaches or bids. On Friday Guardiola was asked whether Ederson would travel to Wolves for Saturday’s late afternoon Premier League opener.“Apparently, yeah,” the manager said. “Ederson didn’t come to me and said he wanted to leave or he has an offer. All the players here are our players and I want them. What’s going to happen in three weeks [before the window closes], nobody knows.”Last month City signed James Trafford from Burnley in a £27m deal, leaving them with three goalkeepers who would consider themselves capable first choices, Stefan Ortega completing that group.Ederson’s compatriot Savinho is being monitored by Tottenham. He is not in Saturday’s squad due to injury but it is not thought this would prevent any potential transfer.Guardiola said: “Whether it’s Tottenham in that case or any other club, a player should call the club [if they wish to move]. I am only concerned right now that Savinho will be with us for the rest of the season and hopefully many years because, at 21 with the potential he has, he has to improve in final positions but he is an extraordinary player.“At the end, as always, the desire of the players is above everything but then they have to find an agreement with the club. If they don’t reach an agreement, the player will be here because the club spends money on those players.”Guardiola was asked whether he had spoken to Savinho and Ederson regarding their futures. “No. If they want to leave, they will come to me,” he said. “If they want to leave, they will knock on my door.”View image in fullscreenSavinho has been linked with a move to Tottenham before the transfer window closes.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Ed Sykes/Apl/SportsphotoRodri had a setback inCity’s 4-3 Club World Cupdefeat by Al-Hilal in his fifth appearance after a anterior cruciate injury but Guardiola said the midfielder would travel to Wolves.“His knee is perfect but he came back against Juventus [at Club World Cup] and after [against Al-Hilal] had an injury of six weeks with his leg,” he said. “We have to try to avoid that [again]. He needs minutes in training sessions, a few minutes if possible with the games. We want a comeback, not steps back. Then you have the dynamic where you cannot get rhythm. He made good sessions already and tomorrow he is travelling, and we will decide if he can play some minutes.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolanewsShareReuse this content"

They have spent almost £200m on players this ­summer.­Viktor Gyökeres is expectedto lead the line against United and the midfielder Martín Zubimendi is also likely to make his debut.Premier League 2025-26 preview No 1: ArsenalRead moreArteta’s side face a tricky run, with a trip to the champions, Liverpool, in their third match, before they face Manchester City at home on 21 September. But theArsenalmanager insisted they could draw on their ­previous experience to get over the line.“You keep digging, digging, ­digging and you have to be digging because one day the gold is going to be there,” he said. “That’s all the time. When I’ve been taught, when I’ve been educated, that’s it. For three seasons we’ve had more points than any other team in this league, which is incredible. That’s how you have all the consistency. Now we have to do it in a season to have one more point or the same amount of points and more goals different than any other team. That’s the objective.”City have actually accumulated four more points than Arsenal’s 247 over the past three seasons. Those clubs have spent similar gross amounts this summer but Liverpool have outstripped them and could add to their squad. Arteta confirmed Arsenal were also looking to bring in more players amid interest in Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze but believes they are capable of competing regardless.View image in fullscreenTony Adams called for Martin Ødegaard to be replaced as captain by Declan Rice.Photograph: John Walton/PA“I think we have great versatility, very different qualities in relation to the opposition as well,” he said. “We can manipulate that and have some great cohesion within those units so we are very happy with that.”The form of Martin Ødegaard will be crucial after he endured a testing season that yielded only three goals and eight assists in the league. Arteta said that despite suggestions from Tony Adams – who led Arsenal to the Double in 2002 – that Declan Rice should take over the captaincy, the Norwegian was the almost unanimous choice in a vote conducted this week by his staff and the rest of the players.“My opinion is clear and it’s not just my opinion, it’s all the staff and especially the players,” he said.Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetanewsShareReuse this content"

The newBrentfordhead coach was 15 when he left his native Dublin to join the Wolves academy when they snapped up five of Ireland’s most promising young players, including a certain Robbie Keane, in 1995. But despite becoming the club’s youngest captain in more than a century Andrews dropped down the divisions with MK Dons before earning a move back to the Premier League with Blackburn and becoming an established international.There has been a similar trajectory to his coaching career. He started under Karl Robinson in Milton Keynes after retiring in 2015, then worked as Stephen Kenny’s assistant for the Republic of Ireland. Andrews also spent time at Sheffield United before arriving at Brentford last summer as the set-piece coach. Beingasked to replace Thomas Frankin his first senior role at the age of 44 bucks the growing trend of younger managers, but the former midfielder has plenty of experience to call on as he opens a new chapter at Nottingham Forest on Sundaytomorrow.Premier League 2025-26 preview No 4: BrentfordRead more“I’ve been through a lot of ups and downs – I’ve been in this industry for 29 years,” Andrews said. “I’ve been in every division, international football, every age group. Some people come into it at a certain stage and there might have been a trendy football club playing a trendy way, and that’s good for them. But this is my path, and I’m pretty happy with the path I’ve been on.”He added: “I [always] knew I wanted to be a head coach. I think after retirement I probably felt I wanted to do it at that stage and I probably could have taken opportunities or could have gone for more opportunities. But I quickly realised that I needed to do more. I needed to put myself in a better position by going through different experiences, which I did. It’s probably been a windy road to a point.”Andrews has spent time closely observing Ireland’s rugby team and several other sports as part of the preparation. He also cites the influence of managers he worked under in a playing career that also took him to West Brom and Bolton, including Roy Hodgson, Sam Allardyce and Giovanni Trapattoni. Andrews recognises there cannot be many harder first assignments than taking over at Brentford in a summer when they have sold theirtop scorer, Bryan Mbeumo, captain, Christian Nørgaard, and goalkeeper Mark Flekken, and with Yoane Wissa wanting to join Newcastle, which has led to his omission from the Forest game.“I don’t feel like I’ve got a point to prove,” Andrews said. “I’m very comfortable in my shoes. I understand that people will be looking at it, obviously. I think the narrative around set-piece coach to head coach is quite a nice one, isn’t it? It doesn’t tell the bigger picture, obviously. But again, I’m OK with that. I’m all right with a little bit of scepticism around me. I think you’d underestimate this club at your peril. I think they’ve proved that over numerous years.View image in fullscreenCaoimhin Kelleher, one of Brentford’s summer signings, in action against QPR in a pre-season friendly.Photograph: Tom Cusden/PPAUK/Shutterstock“I truly believe that if I didn’t feel ready for this role, I wouldn’t have taken it. I really wouldn’t have taken it. I wouldn’t have just taken it to be a head coach. I would have went on that road a little bit longer and found the way to get here at the right time. So I feel I’m absolutely ready.”Brentford, in keeping with their reputation for innovation, were the first Premier League club to employ a set-piece coach and Andrews picked up the mantle last season as they ended up with 13 set-piece goals – the joint-fifth best total. He acknowledged it would take time to stamp his own imprint on a squad after Frank’s almost seven years in charge but believes the arrivals of Caoimhín Kelleher, Jordan Henderson and the Dutch midfielder Antoni Milambo will help to plug some of the gaps created by the high-profile departures.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am big on that. And I think the big one for me is that my team will play with an edge. I think we train with that. I watched it last year and I want to continue to nudge that. I think the signings we have made help that as well.”Andrews, the third Ireland-born manager of a Premier League side after Joe Kinnear and Roy Keane, said he had spoken to Frank “on a couple of occasions”, including on the day of Tottenham’s Super Cup game against Paris Saint-Germain this week. Such has been his obsession with Brentford’s first game of the season that, on the same evening, he found himself distracted during a meal with his wife.“I was having fajitas and [she] was talking to me and it was straight out of my head,” he said. “I was thinking about training and what we were doing [the next day]. I think it’s a healthy obsession. Whether she does or other people do is probably up for debate. But I think you have to be serious about what you’re doing if you want to be successful.”Explore more on these topicsBrentfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Have Manchester City rediscovered their mojo? Have Arsenal finally found the missing pieces of the jigsaw? Will Chelsea’s midsummer Copa Gianni endeavours catch up with them? Can any or all of the three promoted sides make a decent fist of not going straight back down this time? Will Fulham finish 11th or 12th? How adverse an effect will being the father of twins going through the terrible twos have on the form of Jarrod Bowen? Some early clues to the answers of these and many other questions will be provided this weekend as the latest beautifully packaged model of the Premier League rolls off the assembly line, kicking off with tonight’s ding-dong between Liverpool and what’s left of a Bournemouth carcass that has been feasted upon by a wake of vultures during the transfer window. A club so resilient and resourceful that at one point theyexhibited the massed ranks of their lame and haltDavid Blaine-style in a perspex box at the Vitality Stadium, Andoni Iraola’s side will almost certainly be just fine.‘Not in my hands’: diplomatic Howe has lost control of Isak’s Newcastle futureRead moreHopes are high that we might have a title race on our hands and in Viktor Gyökeres, Arsenal have finally got that big No 9 their fans have craved for so long. With decent cover in every position and another graduate from the Emirates creche, Max Dowman [bornDecember 2009– Football Daily Ed] ready to take his first tentative steps into the top-flight cauldron, there are high hopes this season might finally be the mythical “next season” we’ve been assured has been coming for the past four years. Of course, it’s all fun and games until somebody loses one or more key players to the random vagaries of mid- to long-term knack, gah and ouch as Arsenal, Manchester City and various other clubs discovered in the last campaign, while others – including the reigning champions – remained comparatively unscathed.Beyond the obvious title contenders there are currently countless imponderables. Are Everton good again? Has the cloud over Old Trafford reached peak mushroom? What now for Alexander Isak? Will the Thomas Frank factor work at Spurs? In deciding to stick with Daniel Farke, Leeds are adjudged to have taken something of a gamble on an apparently decent coach whose previousPremier Leagueforays have been a study in dignified mournfulness. Farke may well be the first top-flight manager to lose his job unless somebody tonks Burnley first and Scott Parker goes full Scott Parker. While their north-eastern neighbours try to prepare for the new season in the face of an unseemly, very public and ongoing one-man mutiny, Sunderland have quietly gone about the business of unveiling 11 (and counting) on-the-face-of-it astute new signings. That suggests they might finally have put that Netflix banter era behind them, but given the club’s history of slapstick, only time will tell. With this season’s relegation places looking nowhere near as nailed-on as last year, the scramble to avoid them could go right down to the wire. Or at the very least, early April.In, among, and around the football we’ll have all the usual controversies, gripes and grumbles about on-field and in-bunker officialdom, a body of men and women whose already difficult job is being made increasingly tough by forensic scrutiny,the rise of Ref Cam, occasionally inexplicable ineptitude and an increasingly unfathomable handball law that seems tailored specifically to infuriate, baffle and enrage. Oh yes, the Premier League is back and to paraphrase the late American comedian Bill Hicks, bear with it while managers, players and broadcasters everywhere plaster on a fake smile and plough through this sh!t one more time.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEThe Premier League is back, baby.

Slot went to console Semenyo immediately after Liverpool’s dramatic 4-2 victory.A statement from Liverpool read: “Liverpool Football Club is aware of an allegation of racist abuse made during our Premier League game against AFCBournemouth. We condemn racism and discrimination in all forms, it has no place in society or football. The club is unable to comment further as tonight’s alleged incident is the subject of an ongoing police investigation, which we will support fully.”Andoni Iraola, the Bournemouth head coach, said Semenyo was upset after the game but praised the Ghana international for maintaining his composure and scoring two fine goals at Anfield to draw the visitors level. “It’s a shame that in the first game of the Premier League season, with two teams playing a really good game, we have to be talking about something that should be in the past but is not in the past,” said Iraola. “It is something that is still a big problem. Antoine was calm in the heat of the moment. We asked him if he could continue and he was composed but he is asking why these things are happening today? It is a shame.”Slot said the night should have been all about the emotional tributes to Jota, which left Mohamed Salah in tears after the game, and Liverpool’s thrilling victory. “It is unacceptable in any stadium, especially Anfield,” said the Liverpool head coach. “It shouldn’t happen but unfortunately we definitely have to talk about it. It should be about Diogo and how the tributes were. I spoke to Antoine after the game and said the club will do everything we can to find the person responsible. Big credit to him if something happens to him and he can perform like this. He is not only a great player but very strong mentally. But it is unacceptable.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolBournemouthRacenewsShareReuse this content"

His suspension was lifted upon appeal, allowing him to train with and support her onsite throughout the past two weeks in Cincinnati. “It’s great that he’s here in the box, finally, so it’s a good thing,” she said.Since Vukov’s suspension,Rybakina had repeatedly expressed her frustrationabout the ban and she was critical of the WTA. After he was provisionally suspended in January pending the outcome of its investigation, Rybakina said: “I don’t agree with a lot of things what the WTA do in the sense of my relationship with Stefano. As I said before, I have never made any complaints or any of these things. I always said that he never mistreated me.”Although he was banned from receiving credentials to tournaments, Vukov continued to train with Rybakina away from events. She has been working with the Italian former player Davide Sanguinetti since February. This week, Vukov and Sanguinetti have been providing her with advice in training and matches.During her post-match press conference, Rybakina opted not to speak in depth about her work with Vukov. Asked about how helpful it has been to have him onsite again, she responded curtly: “It’s always a help when the whole team is here with me.”View image in fullscreenElena Rybakina talks to coach Stefano Vukov in the stands while playing against Aryna Sabalenka at the Cincinnati Open.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesAnother significant match awaits Rybakina as she rekindles her rivalry with the third seed Iga Swiatek, who remains in excellent form since her Wimbledon victory and defeated the 28th seed Anna Kalinskaya 6-3, 6-4 to advance into the semi-finals.Later on Friday, the men’s second seed Carlos Alcaraz held firm against a quality performance from Andrey Rublev, the 11th seed, as he narrowly reached the semi-final with a 6-3, 4-6, 7-5 win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here, Alcaraz initially appeared to weather the storm as he broke serve for a 5-3 third-set lead but he missed a slew of first serves as he attempted to serve out the match and quickly found himself back at 5-5. Despite missing his first opportunity, Alcaraz maintained his composure and closed out the victory.Alcaraz will face either Ben Shelton or Alexander Zverev in the semi-finals. He and Jannik Sinner are again one round away from facing each other in what would be their fourth consecutive final against each other.Explore more on these topicsTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Rute Cardoso, the wife of Diogo Jota, and the couple’s three children are expected to attend Liverpool’s first competitive game since the tragic summer passing of Jota and his brother, Andre Silva. Tributes to both men will be paid before the game.Howard Webb, the head of the PGMOL, has said that he seesno way back to refereeingfor scandal-hit official David Coote, who was sacked last year.Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler has said it is his belief the club can hold on to midfielder Carlos Baleba for another season despite strong interest from Manchester United.There has been “no change” to thestand-off involving Newcastle United and Alexander Isak, according the club’s head coach, Eddie Howe, who told reporters whatever happens next is out of his control but he can envisage a scenario where the on-strike striker plays for the club again.Bournemouth are closing in on a deal to signthe Liverpool forward Ben Doakfor £25m and could even spirit the 19-year-old Scot away from Anfield on their team coach after tonight’s match. Liverpool have just announced the signing of the 18-year-old centre-backGiovanni Leoni from Parmafor an initial fee of £26m.Bayern Munich have opened talks with Chelsea over a deal for their out-of-favour forward Christopher Nkunku, who never really impressed during the limited opportunities afforded to him at Stamford Bridge in the past two years.Dominic Calvert-Lewin has become the latest target man to be plucked from the revolving carousel of No9s. The former Everton striker has joined Leeds on a free transfer in what could be a canny bit of business if the 28-year-old’s new employers can keep him out of the treatment room.Unai Emery reckons his Aston Villa team are “not a contender to be in the top seven” this season as their efforts at summer squad-maintenance and rebuilding are being hamstrung by profit and sustainability rules.And Nuno Espirito Santo’s first press conference of the season was a similar study in existential angst as the Nottingham Forest manager bemoaned the lack of sufficient additions to his squad ahead of a season in which the club will be competing in Europe for the first time in 30 years.ShareUpdated at13.06 EDT"

It could resemble Samsung’sFlip design– closer to a 2000s-style clamshell phone – or itsFold, more like a foldable iPad.AJPMorgan reporthas suggested that the first foldable iPhone will be revealed in September 2026, priced at $1,999 (£1,474), and will likely expand a foldable phone market expected to reach 19m units in 2025.The rectangular tablet has been a mainstay of phone design for the last 15 years, but could Apple betting on the flip phone be a sign that’s about to change?Tech experts said the new product launch probably reflected the fact that people now mostly access the internet on their phones, rather than laptops or tablets, and are looking for a device that optimises that experience – but the high price point suggests it will remain a premium product.“Apple and all other smartphone makers are somewhat stymied by the fact the smartphone has become somewhat of a boring category – it’s absolutely essential in people’s daily lives, but it no longer has the excitement of the next big thing,” said Ben Wood, an analyst at the tech consultancy CCS Insight.This is why Apple has been reaching for new designs that can get people talking – for example, the ultra-thin iPhone, expected to be launched in September.Wood thinks Apple is entering the foldable market because other companies have experimented first. Samsung’s initial Galaxy Fold designs were bedevilled by screen problems, but next week’s Galaxy Flip and Fold 7 triple release, featuring slimmer designs and bigger screens, is expected to represent the “next generation” of foldable phones, which Samsung will be hoping reversesthe flatlining salesin 2024.“Apple is rarely first to anything – it’s not typically a company that dives in with both feet – it likes to take its time, see how it can refine and optimise it, and deliver the best, most reliable experience, then it jumps,” Wood said.He noted that Samsung’s flip phone has been more popular than the fold model “because it’s cheaper and has captured imagination of the population who like the idea of having something different from everyone else”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This, combined with the fact that young people, especially, tend to use smartphones to go online, suggests that the foldable design could offer an ideal compromise for future consumers.Prof Ben Carter, who researches how smartphones impact our lives at King’s College London, agreed that video watching was “one of the wins” for foldable phones, especially since videos constitute a growing proportion of the content that people consume. Foldable phones can have larger screens and can also be propped up for easier viewing.He thought there could be mental health benefits to a design resembling a “mini-laptop that you can close down”. His research shows that disabling notifications is highly effective in reducing screen time and tackling smartphone addiction.If the screen is not visible, it removes the “variable reward scheme” – the same process by which gambling addiction works, whereby not knowing when you will receive a reward makes something more compelling. “If you can switch it off, more like a laptop, that distraction has gone,” he said, though he noted there waws not yet evidence that people are using foldable phones in this way.This might be especially beneficial for children, who receive on average more than 200 notifications a day – though the high price point of foldable phones makes it unlikely that many will have access to them until their parents pass on secondhand models several years after launch.Prof David Ellis, the chair of behavioural science at the University of Bath, said that other draws include the fact that screens are better protected and fit into a smaller pocket, as well as the “sense of nostalgia that comes with a flip phone”.But he added that it might not be the gamechanger people are expecting: Apple doesn’t have a “100% success rate – theVision Pro[headset] has been a spectacular failure”.Explore more on these topicsAppleMobile phonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It would also help shore up the chipmaker’s finances at a time whenIntelhas been slashing jobs as part of a wider cost-cutting drive.Talks over the potential investment stem from a meeting that took place between the US president, Donald Trump, and the Intel chief executive, Lip-Bu Tan, this week, days after Trumpcalled for Tan to resign, accusing him of having ties to the Chinese Communist party. Bloomberg suggested Tan was likely to stay in charge of the chipmaker.Trump calls for resignation of Intel chief a day after 100% chip tariff threatRead moreCommenting on the Bloomberg report, the White House spokesperson Kush Desai said: “Discussion about hypothetical deals should be regarded as speculation unless officially announced by the administration.”However, the news still sparked excitement among investors, with shares rising as much as 8.9% on Thursday before closing 7.4% higher at the end of trading at $23.86 (£17.60). That pushed the company’s market value to $104.4bn.A stake in Intel would mark the Trump administration’s latest attempt to intervene in key private industry. He has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs of up to 100% on imported semiconductors and chips, which could favour Intel as a US-based semiconductor firm.Earlier this week, the US government announced a deal that would result in the chipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devicespaying 15% of their revenues from Chinese AI chip sales to the US government. Last month, the defence department also announced it would take a $400m preferred stake in the US rare earth producer MP Materials.However, an investment in Intel would mark a U-turn from Trump’s recent aggressive rhetoric against the company’s leadership.Trump took to the Truth Social media platform on Thursday last week to allege: “The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!”Trump’s social media outburst came shortly after the US Republican senator Tom Cotton wrote a letter to the Intel chair, Frank Yeary, over Tan’s investments and ties to semiconductor companies that are reportedly linked to the CCP and the People’s Liberation Army, the party’s military arm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But were the 90s as blissful as we remember?Rhiannon Lucy CosslettFri 15 Aug 2025 10.00 EDTShareWhen I look back on my 1990s childhood, it’s hard not to feel nostalgic. We roamed for miles without supervision, riding our bikes, building dens and swimming in streams. After school, we did crafts or played board games and, though the internet existed, my parents would boot me off to use the landline. Media was tangible – tapes, CDs, VHS – and often consumed as a family. I still recall the thrill of going to the video shop to choose a film.It’s normal to feel like this, especially once you have babies of your own, and the social media algorithms know it. In the three years since I had my son and started writing the Guardian’sRepublic of Parenthood column, I’ve noticed a huge upswing of interest in “90s parenting” and, this year, the trend seems to have exploded. Former 90s kids are in the thick of it, trying to work out how to parent our own children. There’s a feeling that huge advances in technology have resulted in a commensurate loss. But what of? Is it possible to get it back? And was parenting really better back then?“Yes. Full stop,” says Justin Flom, a father of two and content creator based in Las Vegas, whobuilt a replica Blockbuster video storefor his daughters in one of the rooms of his house. “The whole family would pile into the car, head to the video store and roam the aisles while deciding what to watch,” he says of his own childhood. “It felt exciting, full of possibility. Scrolling online just isn’t the same.” There’s something about going to a physical place to choose a film together, as well as the anticipation and the delayed gratification when finally watching, that made it feel like an event. “Everyone remembers that blue and yellow sign, the carpet, the ritual of choosing a movie together.”Some parents are giving their kids landlines, creating a retro bubble of resistance against screensNot everyone has the space or the budget to do what Justin has, but the reasoning underpinning his decision would be familiar to many. “As a parent, I’m constantly guarding my children against content I don’t think is good for their brains,” he says. “We prefer older movies and shows, partly because I think the pacing is healthier. They’re not as chaotic or overstimulating.” His girls love the Home Alone movies, Harriet the Spy and Dennis the Menace, and their current favourite is George of the Jungle. Like Justin, I have been drawn towards 1990s media for my son. Current favourites are Pooh’s Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin and Teletubbies, which were both made in 1997 and are a welcome contrast to the frenetic speed of more modern shows.Justin’s Blockbuster room is a way of making screen time intentional, and that seems to be at the heart of this idea of 90s parenting. “In the 90s, the critique was that TV would rot your brain, but it was stationary,” he says. “It lived in your living room. Now, media follows us everywhere. It’s in our pockets, on demand, nonstop. In my house, we work hard to compartmentalise media. It happens at a specific time and in a specific place. That’s part of what made Blockbuster special: it was a destination.”View image in fullscreenComposite: Getty ImagesWith increasing fears about the effects of screen time, and parent-led campaigns such asSmartphone Free Childhoodgaining popularity, it’s no surprise so many of us are looking back to the era just before they exploded. Some parents –and schools– are even giving their children landlines. Agroup of parentsin South Portland in the US has done it so their kids can call each other, creating a “retro bubble” of resistance against screens. Scrolling through 90s parenting-themed reels on Instagram (I’m aware of the irony), I’m struck bya videoof a group of adults and kids having a back garden water fight (organised via landline, of course), having put all their smartphones in a bowl on top of a high cupboard. It takes me back to a time when we weren’t stuck behind screens and our summers often saw all the neighbourhood kids engaged in huge water fights. It was when the mums joined in – coming out with a bucket or washing up bowl so you knew they meant business – that you’d get really excited.Jess Russell is a big believer in the importance of play. A former primary school teacher and special needs coordinator, Jess is now a stay-at-home mum to two children, aged one and three, and uses her Instagram account@playideasforlittlesto campaign for more learning through play in the curriculum. “I grew up in the countryside, and we were outside all the time. My mum was a stay-at-home mum. We’d do lots of arts and crafts at home,” she says. She’s trying to replicate this with her own children by giving them a slower pace of life, with lots of time in the garden and playing board games such as Hungry Hungry Hippos, and only watching TV as a family.Long stretches of unremarkable time were a gift I didn’t know I’d miss, and I want that for my kids. I don’t want to schedule every hour of their livesOne of the reasons Jess left teaching was because she was disillusioned by the direction of education, away from play-based fun towards a more results-driven system. She feels lucky to be able to stay at home to look after her children – which was far more common in the 90s, when you didn’t always need two incomes to cover housing costs. I feel the same about working part-time, and wonder if 90s nostalgia is partly to do with modern parents having to work all hours to keep their heads above water, when they’d like more time with their kids and for it to be playful.It’s not just about screens, I realise, it’s about connection, family time and, actually, time more generally. “Parenting in the 90s was basically just ‘slow’ parenting,” says Jess. That means not ferrying kids from activity to activity so days are jam-packed. Boredom is important, says Melanie Murphy, a mother of two from Dublin, who describes herself as“your nostalgic millennial mum friend” on Instagram. “Long stretches of unremarkable time were a gift I didn’t know I’d miss, and I want that for my kids. I don’t want to schedule every hour of their lives. I don’t want their lives to go by while their eyes are fixed on a device inches from their faces.”View image in fullscreenComposite: Getty ImagesIt is when her children, aged two and four, are bored, says Melanie, that their imaginations really take over. “They’ll build forts, the floor will be lava, underneath the table will become a dragon’s den. We go outside in old clothes and get filthy looking for bugs. They’ll ‘help me’ cook the dinner and clean the house … We play music and have dance parties. We watch my old DVDs on a projector. We colour and paint for hours and read lots of books. Treasure hunts, picnics, making a mess, simple conversations. My husband and I have pulled back on structured activities, adult-led plans and screen time, and as a result our house constantly looks like a bomb has dropped, but the kids are happy so we don’t care.”No doubt some 90s kids will laugh bitterly reading that.One funny videoabout 90s childhoods describes them as following your mum around changing rooms and having your hair cut in the kitchen, both experiences I can identify with. When I ask a friend if she mothers like a 90s parent, or knows anyone who does, she replies: “Hmmm … as in sleep training, lots of TV and Crispy Pancakes?”What I long for isn’t a time machine, but a nice blend: the laid-back spirit of 90s parenting with the emotional awareness and knowledge we have todayShe has a point. Every 90s parenting proponent I speak to, though, is well aware of the danger of rose‑tinted spectacles (round ones with wire frames, naturally). I ask Melanie which aspects of the 90s she might want to leave in the past. “The physical discipline. Being taught to ‘toughen up’ instead of allowing emotions to pass through the body as they’re meant to,” she says, also citing sleep training and the ‘naughty step’. The list goes on: “Secondhand smoke everywhere. The neglect of mental health … Gender stereotyping was off the charts, so was diet culture and UPF (ultra-processed foods) culture.” Her mum was in WeightWatchers, and Melanie used to binge on Pop-Tarts, then try to “undo” the snacks with sit-ups. That can all stay in the past. She also points out not all families were watching films together. In some, there was “little to no supervision of media consumption” and the children would see some incredibly inappropriate and traumatic content.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In my own case, though, I look back wistfully on how “free range” I was as a child. Justin’s experience was similar. “My parents didn’t always know where I was and that was OK,” he says. “I got hurt sometimes. Kids used to break their arms sometimes. And then we learned not to do the thing that broke our arm.” (I did indeed break my arm.)View image in fullscreenComposite: Getty Images“That kind of risk-taking is important. It’s how kids learn judgment. These days, we bubble-wrap childhood so tightly that we’re taking those lessons away,” he says. There has been too much of an overcorrection, he thinks, and people “are longing for something a little looser, a little more analogue. Parenting that’s not ruled by fear.”In other words, we are looking to redress the balance. “We know so much more now – about emotions, neurodiversity, safeguarding, food – and that’s obviously a good thing,” says Melanie. “What I long for isn’t a time machine, but a nice blend: the laid-back spirit of 90s parenting with the emotional awareness and knowledge we have today.”I thought it was worth talking to someone who actually was a parent in the 90s about it, so Jess put me in touch with her mum, Lynn. “I had precious time with my children and I really value that,” she says of their long days spent outdoors, at home or with friends. She points out that shops used to be closed on a Sunday, and the simple joy of that being a day for family. “Today’s parents are craving that simplicity in family time.View image in fullscreenComposite: Getty Images“We lived in a two-bedroom house, and I had a rubbish car … Now people feel as if they have to sustain this standard of living. I feel really sorry for them, because there’s just too much pressure.” I ask Lynn if there is anything that is better now, and she struggles to think of anything. “I really admire mums nowadays because you’re balancing so much. I just didn’t have that. It was really quite straightforward.”I’ll confess that when I first encountered the concept of 90s parenting, I thought it was a bit of a sentimental gimmick, driven by ageing millennials in thrall to social media algorithms. But if that is the case then why, writing this, do I feel so … sad? Perhaps the combined pressures of childcare and working, not to mention exhaustion (my son hasn’t been sleeping) are making me feel wobbly, but I suddenly feel close to tears thinking about choosing a VHS in the local Spar, even though that film was Scream (1996) and my mum made us turn it off. I can’t quite seem to shake this feeling of loss, and of wanting to return to a simpler time. Maybe I just need more fun in my life. Time for a water fight, I think.

They reproduce sexist and racist caricatures more at home in the country’s imagined monocultural past.Can AI deliver economic nirvana? Only if workers can monitor and shape how it’s used | Peter LewisRead moreBasic prompts, tired tropesIn May 2024, we asked: what do Australians and Australia look like according to generative AI?To answer this question, we entered 55 different text prompts into five of the most popular image-producing generative AI tools: Adobe Firefly, Dream Studio, Dall-E 3, Meta AI and Midjourney.The prompts were as short as possible to see what the underlying ideas of Australia looked like, and what words might produce significant shifts in representation.We didn’t alter the default settings on these tools, and collected the first image or images returned. Some prompts were refused, producing no results. (Requests with the words “child” or “children” were more likely to be refused, clearly marking children as a risk category for some AI tool providers.)Overall, we ended up with a set of about 700 images.They produced ideals suggestive of travelling back through time to an imagined Australian past, relying on tired tropes such as red dirt, Uluru, the outback, untamed wildlife and bronzed Aussies on beaches.View image in fullscreen‘A typical Australian family’ generated by Dall-E 3 in May 2024We paid particular attention to images of Australian families and childhoods as signifiers of a broader narrative about “desirable” Australians and cultural norms.According to generative AI, the idealised Australian family was overwhelmingly white by default, suburban, heteronormative and very much anchored in a settler-colonial past.‘An Australian father’ with an iguanaThe images generated from prompts about families and relationships gave a clear window into the biases baked into these generative AI tools.“An Australian mother” typically resulted in white, blond women wearing neutral colours and peacefully holding babies in benign domestic settings.View image in fullscreen‘An Australian mother’ generated by Dall-E 3 in May 2024The only exception to this was Firefly which produced images of exclusively Asian women, outside domestic settings and sometimes with no obvious visual links to motherhood at all.Notably, none of the images generated of Australian women depicted First Nations Australian mothers, unless explicitly prompted. For AI, whiteness is the default for mothering in an Australian context.View image in fullscreen‘An Australian parent’ generated by Firefly in May 2024Similarly, “Australian fathers” were all white. Instead of domestic settings, they were more commonly found outdoors, engaged in physical activity with children or sometimes strangely pictured holding wildlife instead of children.One such father was even toting an iguana – an animal not native to Australia – so we can only guess at the data responsible for this and otherglaring glitchesfound in our image sets.Alarming levels of racist stereotypesPrompts to include visual data of Aboriginal Australians surfaced some concerning images, often with regressive visuals of “wild”, “uncivilised” and sometimes even “hostile native” tropes.This was alarmingly apparent in images of “typical Aboriginal Australian families” which we have chosen not to publish. Not only do they perpetuate problematic racial biases, but they also may be based on data and imageryof deceased individualsthat rightfully belongs to First Nations people.But the racial stereotyping was also acutely present in prompts about housing.Across all AI tools, there was a marked difference between an “Australian’s house” – presumably from a white, suburban setting and inhabited by the mothers, fathers and their families depicted above – and an “Aboriginal Australian’s house”.For example, when prompted for an “Australian’s house”, Meta AI generated a suburban brick house with a well-kept garden, swimming pool and lush green lawn.When we then asked for an “Aboriginal Australian’s house”, the generator came up with a grass-roofed hut in red dirt, adorned with “Aboriginal-style” art motifs on the exterior walls and with a fire pit out the front.View image in fullscreen‘An Aboriginal Australian’s house’, generated by Meta AI in May 2024The differences between the two images are striking.

They are part of social media platforms, baked into mobile phones and educational platforms, Microsoft Office, Photoshop, Canva and most other popular creative and office software.In short, they are unavoidable.Our research shows generative AI tools will readily produce content rife with inaccurate stereotypes when asked for basic depictions of Australians.Given how widely they are used, it’s concerning that AI is producing caricatures of Australia and visualising Australians in reductive, sexist and racist ways.Given the ways these AI tools are trained on tagged data, reducing cultures to cliches may well be a feature rather than a bug for generative AI systems.Tama Leaver is a professor of internet studies at Curtin University.

Single-player, story-led action experiences with a weekend’s worth of choreographed set pieces and an open world glazed with a fine mist of collectibles … But here in 2025, the age of the Battle Pass and live service forever games, Hangar 13’s solo adventure about Sicilian crime families feels almost as dated as its 1900s setting.In fact, The Old Country has few new ideas to contribute to the cover shooter genre, nor to the Mafia series itself. Hangar 13 already produced aremake in 2020 of the original Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven, but in this game it often feels like the studio’s remaking it yet again in a different setting. Both the storyline and structure of its individual missions seem to be at the very least giving a reverential nod of the fedora to that 2002 title.View image in fullscreenYou can see where this is going … Mafia: The Old Country.Photograph: 2K GamesCase in point: the “win a race to impress your Don” mission trope. This chapter was infamous in the original Mafia because the 1930s race cars were extremely hard to handle and the race was all but unwinnable, but it was also a sophisticated multi-stage mission structure full of sabotage, theft and unexpected double-crossings. Mafia: The Old Country simply has you riding out to a town where a race is due to take place, then tells you the Don needs a replacement rider and drops you into the saddle for an uneventful canter around a course that features no real challenge. Ten years ago, such a by-the-numbers experience would have been criticised, but right now the scarcity of games like this means you’re inclined to look past the basic mission design and enjoy its strongest assets instead: its story, and its sense of time and place.It’s 1904 and you are Enzo Favara, an unfortunate young man with no family to speak of who finds himself working down in the sulphur mines with his fellowcarusiin their yellow-stained rags and shaven heads. After working conditions at the mine tip past horrific and into fatal, Enzo stands up to his sadistic employers and makes a powerful enemy in Don Ruggero Spadaro, the local “businessman” who owns the mine. Not to worry, though – after fleeing, he’s taken in by Don Torrisi, a rival of Spadaro’s, who appreciates the young man’s bravery and work ethic. You can see where this is going.View image in fullscreenRich setting … Mafia: The Old Country.Photograph: 2K GamesWhat follows is your typical ascendancy through the ranks of a crime family, expressed through the medium of knife fights and old timey shootouts, in the era when reloading a pistol takes three to five days. Local businesses refuse to pay up. Workers go on strike. Bandits and rival families threaten your reputation. You journey to a locale that’s conveniently littered with waist-high cover, hunker down and set to them.In fairness to Enzo and his associates, missions aren’t always about all-out violence. At times you’re sneaking around, distracting guards by throwing coins and bottles to lure them away from your path. There’s a lot of riding horses and driving cars and plenty of expository chat to deepen the context of your actions either side of the fracas. These mechanics outside combat are not especially exciting, but this is a mafia game. It’s not trying to be a deep, systems-laden experience – it just wants to tell you a gangster story.And by the skin of its teeth, it succeeds in that endeavour. But it does so via premise rather than plot. The beats are predictable. The memorable moments aren’t clever lines of dialogue or dramatic denouements, but vivid historical details. Pheasants strung up in pantries, baskets of citrus fruit piled high in fields. Workers stamping on grapes in the Torrisi vineyard. Historically accurate recipes for spezzatino di maiale on kitchen counters. The Sicilian dialect peppered throughout each conversation (I heartily recommend going all-in and changing to Sicilian audio localisation with English subtitles). Here is a game that has done its research, and brought to life a geographical and historical setting previously unvisited by games.

Here, the team that made the shooter reflect on how it all happenedThomas HobbsFri 15 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 04.01 EDTShareThe rapper50 Cent(real name Curtis Jackson) was inescapable back in 2005. There wasn’t a British classroom without a teenager wearing Jackson’s G-Unit clothing, while his catchy hits Candy Shop and In Da Club dominated the radio. The backstory of this Queens-born New Yorker – how he survived being shot nine times only to become one of the world’s biggest rappers – also made for compelling lore.That year, 50 Cent sold more than a million copies in one week with his sophomore studio album, The Massacre. In a bid to cash in on this superstardom, his label Interscope Records planned a twin strategy: a Hollywood biopic (Get Rich or Die Tryin’) and a licensed video game, 50 Cent: Bulletproof – both to be released by November 2005. “I think the general public are going to be blown away by my game,” 50 Cent told the website IGN. “It feels more like an action film.”British developer GenuineGames, previously responsible for a poorly received Fight Club tie-in, was tasked with creating Fiddy’s 128-bit era adventure. The problem was it only had 11 months to do it. “I remember we’d get to the office at 7am and wouldn’t leave until about 11pm,” recalls the game’s artist Han Randhawa. “We all lived on a diet of KFC. 50 Cent became my whole life. I even read up the doctor’s report from when he got shot, just so I could put bandages on his 3D character in the right places.”The game’s designer, Haydn Dalton, says: “It’s funny, because this was a game about these dudes from the hood, and yet here was this white guy from the north-west of England writing all their in-game dialogue. It was kind of awkward, but I didn’t have much time, so it was about making stuff up on the fly.”View image in fullscreenShoot first, questions later …Photograph: THQTime has been surprisingly kind to50 Cent: Bulletproof, which is 20 this November. In this shooter, 50 Cent gets caught up in a shadowy underground network full of dodgy terrorists, racist biker gangs and mouthy mafia members. Looking to track down whoever riddled him with those nine bullet wounds, 50 and his G-Unit gang (including Tony Yayo, Young Buck and Lloyd Banks) race through inner city environments, shooting first and asking questions later.It’s as if G-Unit has been modelled on the A-Team, with each member bringing something unique (Yayo is an explosives expert; Banks picks locks), while the game also has surprisingly intuitive cover mechanics, whereby your squad ducks behind walls during shootouts. With its screenplay written by the Sopranos’ writer Terence Winter, the cinematic cut-scenes involving 50 Cent conversing with corrupt Det McVicar are a particular thrill.Power player: how 50 Cent went from rapper to unlikely TV kingpinRead moreHe is a dirty cop voiced by a madcap Eminem, who constantly demands more extortion money so he can send his kid to expensive karate classes. The White rapper’s McVicar is joined by Dr Dre, who voices a stoned arms dealer who says things like “That’s some serious shit right there”, whenever 50 Cent purchases a rocket launcher. The game is stacked full of licensed 50 Cent songs, too, meaning you can kick a heavy in the face while Wanksta plays in the background.“We were really blessed, because 50 Cent felt more like a superhero than just a rapper,” explains the game’s director David Broadhurst. “The idea was to make him a Black James Bond.” Yet Broadhurst admits the British development team missed out on a lot of this production’s glitz and glamour. “Vivendi [the game’s publisher] kept us away from 50 Cent and G-Unit; we’d get sent all their audio. I remember 50 Cent had invested in Vitamin Water, so we had to put the drink into the game as a purchasable item.”View image in fullscreenConcept art for 50 Cent: Bulletproof.Photograph: Vivendi Universal GamesSpecific requests are something Randhawa also remembers. He says that G-Unit member Tony Yayo wanted constant revisions made to his character’s face. “I knew I’d done a good job on Yayo,” laughs Randhawa. “When we wrapped one of the executive producers came over to me and was like: ‘The other members of G-Unit say you absolutely nailed Yayo’s ugliness!’”According to Dalton, the original idea was for 50 Cent: Bulletproof to be more of an open world game akin to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. An early build allowed 50 to jump on the subway to navigate the Big Apple, but strict deadlines meant the development team settled for a more straightforward experience. Dalton reveals: “One idea was that 50 managed all these hookers in the street and they’d go out and collect drug money for him. 50 could control these women through a mobile phone and a special Pimp Management System (PMS). I know people might cringe at this feature today, but Bulletproof was a product of its time.”Whereas other rap video games, such as those in the Def Jam fighting series, had violently pinned emcees against one another, Bulletproof refreshingly depicted rappers as the heroes. “It was a nice to have a piece of art where the rapper was the outright hero rather than the antihero,” explains former G-Unit Records’ executive producer Sha Money XL.View image in fullscreen‘If you shot at G-Unit in 2005 then we were gonna shoot back’ …Photograph: Vivendi Universal GamesMoney XL helmed the 50 Cent: Bulletproof soundtrack and he admits the game’s title could easily have been seen by the rapper’s many enemies as a call to violence. “Maybe some people wanted to test if 50 really was bulletproof, but if anyone was going to shoot at G-Unit in 2005 then we were gonna shoot back. Back then, 50 was the kind of person you either loved or you hated.”This divisiveness might explain why 50 Cent: Bulletproof was savaged by critics. The game only has a 52% score on Metacritic, with reviewers criticising the game’s clunky aiming. The game’s director believes there was a clear agenda against the production from the off.“It was obvious a lot of the reviewers hadn’t even played Bulletproof,” Broadhurst says. “Maybe they didn’t like licensed games or a Black lead character who sold drugs. I don’t know, but a lot of people were picking it up expecting something bad and coming away feeling surprised when it turned out to be pretty good.”There were scrapped plans for a direct Bulletproof sequel, where the focus was on urban warfare and G-Unit surviving amid an America caught up in a civil war. However, 50 Cent: Bulletproof did inspire an underrated 2009 sequel via the Swordfish Studios-developed50 Cent: Blood in the Sand, where Fiddy bizarrely fights the war on terror throughout the Middle East, pissed off after having a crystal skull stolen by terrorists.Furious, funny and potentially fatal: hip-hop’s 20 greatest diss tracks – ranked!Read moreThese two 50 Cent titles weren’t a trigger for more hip-hop video games. Dalton has a theory as to why: “50 Cent was the last truly global mainstream rap superstar. There’s been a vacuum since. Even though our game made a lot of money, a new rapper game just isn’t obvious.”Owing to the complex licensing agreements in place, it’s unlikely there will be a remaster of 50 Cent: Bulletproof any time soon. But for those who want a time machine back to 2005, tracking down a copy of the original on eBay is essential.As Dalton puts it: “Yes our game was rushed, but I don’t have any regrets. When you go on Reddit you see a lot of people nostalgic for what we created. I’m not so sure a Drake game would hit the same way as he’s too soft by comparison. There aren’t many rappers right for a video game, but 50 Cent was 100% one of them.”Explore more on these topicsGames50 CentRetro gamesRapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

USA Swimming’s failure runs deeper than medalsBryan Armen GrahamThe 23-times gold medallist warns of drift and weak leadership. Governance failures, and a troubled safeguarding record, could cost the US more than podium places at LA 2028Fri 15 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 08.14 EDTShareIn three years’ time, the swimming programme for the Los Angeles Olympics will unfold over nine days and nights on the grandest stage the sport has ever known. A purpose-built pool inside SoFi Stadium in Inglewood will be the centerpiece ofa 38,000-capacity open-air natatorium, transforming the $5bn home of the NFL’s Rams and Chargers into what’s said to be the largest swimming venue in history. For the United States, a rare Summer Games on home soil should be a coronation, a chance to showcase the depth of its talent in the country’s most spectacular arena. Yet Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of them all, fears the US swimming program is in no shape to seize the moment.Phelpshas launched a withering attackon USA Swimming’s leadership, accusing it of “weak” stewardship, “poor operational controls” and presiding over years of organizational drift. The 23-times Olympic gold medalist said he would think twice about letting his own sons join the system in its current state. His concerns, he says, stretch back to his own competitive career, when athlete voices were too often brushed aside in the name of keeping the peace and presenting a united front. “This isn’t on the athletes,” he wrotein a lengthy Instagram statement. “This is on the leadership of USA Swimming.”The decline he sees is cultural and structural as much as competitive. In 2016, Phelps was part of a US swim team in Rio that, by his measure, was “arguably the most successful in the sport’s history”, winning 57% of the medals available in the pool. Eight years later in Paris, that share fell to 44% – the lowest for Team USA since the 1988 Olympics – a downtick he cites as evidence the cracks in the system have widened. An open letter he sent earlier this year to USASwimming, co-signed by other medallists, world record holders, coaches and staff, was, he says, ignored. His prescription is sweeping: an independent review of the board, improved athlete services and renewed grassroots investment to reverse flagging membership.Other greats share his alarm. The 12-times Olympic medalist Ryan Lochterecently posted a meme, also shared by Phelps, likening USA Swimming to an interred corpse, while three-time Olympic champion and NBC analyst Rowdy Gaines has gone public with his concernsin an op-ed for Swimming World magazine. Gaines calls the organization’s year-long absence of a CEO a “leadership void” at the worst possible time. He warns that even thetable-topping nine gold medalswon at this summer’s world championships in Singapore – despite the severegastroenteritis outbreakthat badly compromised the US team – should not mask “deeper structural issues under the surface”. Both men see LA 2028 as a deadline: the last chance to repair the system before the lights go up in Inglewood.View image in fullscreenMichael Phelps competes at the 2016 Rio Olympics, where the United States won 57% of the medals available in the pool. That share dropped to 44% last year in Paris.Photograph: François-Xavier Marit/AFP/Getty ImagesNotably, Phelps’s broadside does not directly address the most damaging area of USA Swimming’srecent history: its handling of sexual abuse, harassment and athlete safeguarding. Earlier this year, incoming CEO Chrissi Rawak resigned after just nine days when the organization learned of an undisclosed SafeSport complaint against her from her coaching days. The US Center for SafeSport itself, which handles such allegations, has been in anongoing state of turmoil: its own chief executive was dismissed amid scrutiny of hiring practices, including an investigatorwho himself was later chargedwith multiple sex crimes, including rape, sex trafficking and soliciting prostitution. Survivors have reported retraumatization through flawed investigations, and their trust in both SafeSport and USA Swimming’s vetting processes remains fragile at best, if not fractured beyond repair.These controversies form the unspoken backdrop to Phelps’s and Gaines’s governance concerns. Their focus is on performance, leadership and resources, but the weaknesses they describe – poor oversight, slow action, lack of accountability – are the same flaws critics have long identified in the organization’s handling of abuse cases. If USA Swimming cannot convincingly address either set of problems, the sport risks arriving at the once-in-a-lifetime platform of a home Games with not only a competitive deficit, but a deficit of credibility.A home Olympics is an exceptional and defining moment for any sport. For American swimming, LA 2028 offers the chance to inspire a new generation, boost grassroots participation and cement the sport’s place in a crowded US sporting landscape. It is also, as Gaines notes, a one-shot opportunity: miss it and the momentum may be lost for decades. That is why the absence of a clear vision, not least a permanent leader, concerns those who understand both the stakes and the clock. SoFi Stadium may promise the grandest stage in Olympic history, but whether USA Swimming will be ready for it remains an open question.Explore more on these topicsSwimmingMichael PhelpsLA Olympic Games 2028USA Olympic teamRyan LochteUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

But while we Israelis hide in our air-conditioned houses, offices and cars, the besieged residents of Gaza can only add the unbearable hot and humid atmosphere to theirstruggleto eat, drink and sleep, in constant fear of death. The starvation crisis that has exploded in Gaza this summer, following Israeli-imposed restrictions on the flow of humanitarian aid, continues to worsen despite mounting international pressure to allow in more food, medicine and critical supplies. And the killing has never stopped, while Israel is preparing for the next stage of the war to “annihilate Hamas”.Most Israelis are self-immunised to the horrors being endured by Palestinians in Gaza. Told by our government and mainstream media that there is no starvation, only Hamas propaganda and fake news spread by antisemites in the western media, they see no moral dilemma. And so, after almost two years of fighting, life in Tel Aviv recalls the antebellum days of endless partying. The beaches and restaurants are packed and Ben Gurion airport is busy again with summer vacationers flying to Greece. Israel’seconomic data is outperformingexpectations. Antiwar sentiment is limited to fear for the plight of Israeli hostages in Hamas tunnels, decreasing motivation to re-enlist inreservist units, and growingPTSD and suicidecases in the military. Nevertheless, most Israelis,even diehard critics of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, would give him carte blanche to continue with the ongoing punishment of Gaza.This public complacency allows Netanyahu to focus his attention on his favourite territory of political power-plays and media manipulation. His current aim issubordinating the military, and the ongoing war gives him an unprecedented opportunity.Zoom out: throughout his long, embattled political career, the chief rivals of Israel’s prime minister have been former military leaders. Having led the country’s most revered institution, they have been the epitome of its old liberal establishment, which Netanyahu vowed to crush and replace withnew elitescomposed of his socially conservative and religious supporters.Beginning with Yitzhak Rabin in the 1990s, Netanyahu has fought them all – military heroes such as Ariel Sharon and Ehud Barak and uniformed apparatchiks including Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot – and survived at the helm. But in a country fighting a permanent war, political control of the military is the key to leadership, and Netanyahu had been restrained by the de facto veto power of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and intelligence community over war-and-peace decision-making.Then came the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023, which the military and intelligence services had failed to anticipate and to contain in time. To most Israelis, it was the worst disaster in the country’s history. But not to Netanyahu, who sensed an unprecedented opportunity to consolidate his power and push aside his long-term rivals. He put the blame squarely on the shoulders of the military and intelligence top brass andprevented an independent inquiry. As the war has dragged on, security chiefs have been purged one after another, to be replaced by the prime minister’s loyalists. The purges have enabled him to spin the story and credit himself for the more successful moves against Hezbollah and Iran, and even for the downfall of the Assad regime in Syria.But self-praise was not enough to make the IDF an offshoot of the “Bibist” personality cult. Netanyahu could only envy his political partner and far-right leader Itamar Ben-Gvir, who had turned Israel’s police and prison service into his private militia bymanipulatingthe senior appointments process. In March, Netanyahu made his move to take over the Kirya, Israel’s answer to the Pentagon, in central Tel Aviv, nominating Lt Gen Eyal Zamir as the new IDF chief of staff. A broad-shouldered tank commander who had served as the prime minister’s military aide a decade earlier, Zamir had close-up knowledge of his former boss and his inner circle. The rightwing politicians and twitterati praised him as an “offensive” commander who would defeat Hamas, unlike his unlucky predecessor, Herzi Halevi, who carried the burden of the 7 October failure. And he was widely expected to preserve the draft exemption for ultra-Orthodox men, relieving Netanyahu of apolitical hot potato.At first, Zamir was quick to adapt. On 18 March, Israel breached ashort-lived ceasefirewith Hamas, intensifying its attacks and temporarily halting the flow of food and humanitarian aid into Gaza. In May, themilitary launched another operationto “eliminate Hamas” and appeared in sync with the stated goal of Netanyahu and the right wing: ethnic cleansing of Gaza by relocating its 2 million Palestinians into guarded enclaves, from which the only way out would be abroad.But it didn’t take long for the supposed Netanyahu crony to expose a different set of priorities. While showing no mercy for the Palestinians, Zamir behaved like the older, risk-averse version of his boss, putting the safety of his troops – and of the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza – above all. And he stuck to his predecessor’s support of Haredi conscription, issuing thousands of draft notes to ultra-Orthodox youth. By early August, as Hamas would not surrender, Netanyahu and his far-right coalition pledged to occupy the remaining Palestinian enclaves even at the risk of harming the hostages. This was Zamir’s moment of rebellion. He reportedlythreatened to resignif forced into a risky operation that would entail long-term occupation.Netanyahu was quick to seize the power-play opportunity, leading as usual from behind. Yair, the prime minister’s son and alpha dog whistler, accused Zamir of abanana-republic military coup.Matters came to a head in a heated security cabinet meeting on 6 August, at which the chief of staff warned against sending his troops into what was “tantamount … to a trap” and risking the hostages’ lives. The compromise was a decision to occupy only Gaza City, force its million inhabitants out and raze it – just as the IDF had already done in Rafah and Khan Yunis. A two-month deadline was given before implementation, leaving time for a last-minute hostages-for-ceasefire deal.The power struggle, however, did not stop after the cabinet decision, as defence minister Israel Katz kept up his pressure on Zamir to bow or leave. The once unthinkable idea of sacking the military chief after less than six months in office, an almost Stalinist pace of purging, has now been normalised in the public sphere. The supposed potential successor candidates are “more offensive” generals committed to obeying the prime minister and working towards Gaza’s total destruction.All this unfolds amid Gaza’s starvation crisis and hostages suffering in Hamas tunnels. On Sunday, a mass protest and strike has been organised, calling for an end to the war and the return of the hostages. It enjoys wide support in opinion polls, which Netanyahu is trying to ignore. Instead, he is doubling down on his dual mission of ethnic cleansing inGazaand consolidating his autocracy in Israel. And so, in an unpredictable twist, Lt Gen Zamir has cast himself as the unlikely leader of resistance to both goals – just like Netanyahu’s age-old military rivals.True to form, Netanyahu likes to keep his options open, while leaving his opponents with uneasy choices and telling different, and often contradictory, stories to different people. Israeli pundits debate whether he wants to end the war, reach a partial deal, or keep a low-level and less costly fight. Only two things are clear: the prime minister has an insatiable quest for power and longevity in office; and the death toll in Gaza from bombing and malnutrition keeps rising, while Israelis keep looking the other way.Aluf Benn is the editor-in-chief of HaaretzDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But when I saw the longlist, I had to actFri 15 Aug 2025 11.40 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 11.44 EDTShareLast week, I withdrew my nomination from the longlist for the Polari first book prize. The awards had become mired in controversy due to the nomination of the Irish author John Boyne, best known for The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, for the main prize for his novel Earth. Four days before the longlist announcement, Boyne hadwritten in the Irish Independent, celebrating JK Rowling “as a fellow terf” and saying of women who had “pilloried” her for her gender activism: “For every Commander Waterford, there’s a Serena Joy standing behind him, ready to pin a handmaiden down as her husband rapes her.”I think such a viewpoint is abhorrent, but Boyne is free to hold whatever views he wants. What was unacceptable was astatementfrom the Polari prize addressing the backlash, emphasising its commitment to “support trans rights and amplify trans voices”, but defending Boyne’s inclusion on the grounds that submissions are assessed purely “on the merits of craft and content” and that “within our community, we can at times hold radically different positions on substantive issues”.I immediately withdrewupon reading it, after the resignation of judge Nicola Dinan, who won the prize last year, and withdrawal of fellow longlisted author Mae Diansangu. Since then, a further judge has withdrawn and at least 16 authors across both lists have excused themselves from consideration. It was not a difficult or painful decision – I felt misled about the principles underpinning the organisation and I no longer cared to be awarded by it. I have, in the past, been shortlisted for my work alongside writers whose views I did not agree with. But in those instances, their positions didn’t undermine the stated values and politics of the prize. This isn’t a matter of differing views, but of an institution properly and accurately representing itself.The prize has always been for the entire LGBTQ+ community, as evidenced by previously shortlisted, and winning, entries from trans writers. And so it is a contradiction to include someone who is trans-exclusionary (terf stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminist). The prize claims that it does “not eliminate books based on the wider views of the writer”. But a prize claiming to be a celebration of LGBTQ+ inclusion should know that the condition of trans people isn’t reducible to a debate in which people are simply holding “different positions” – they are a minority group facing unprecedented levels of harassment and political antagonism.Not all of my fellow longlisted authors have chosen this path; some have, while affirming their commitment to trans rights, stated their intentions to remain. Avi Ben-Zeev (the only trans author nominated)stated his reasoningas, “If I walk away, I’m erasing my trans story” andregretted that“transphobia has shifted the conversation away from the celebration of LGBTQ+ literature”, while emphasising the solidarity between longlisted writers regardless of their decision.I can understand such a position, but I think it undermines collective solidarity, rather than being an example of it. I think there is significant power in authors acting as a collective bloc. I was particularly moved by the example of the US writers whowithdrew from the PEN America literary awardslast year, in protest against the institution’s lack of criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza. And to me, the real celebration of LGBTQ+ literature has come not from the prize, but from the community that has rallied behind the withdrawn authors. Our withdrawal has been followed by a 800-strong petition to remove Boyne from the longlist. That is not about him per se – he is obviously suffering great personal upset at this situation. It is, once again, about the stated aims of the organisation.We have, of course, been subjected to the usual name-calling: described as the “Trans Taliban” and “Queer Isis” by Julie Bindel; accused of being proponents of “radicalised”, “totalitarian” politics by Canadian novelist Allan Stratton.Some have accused critics of bullyingBoyne, and compromising freedom of speech and expression. But we have not called for his books to be pulped, and evidently he has, and continues to be, more than free to share whatever views he likes and write as many books as he wants.Boyne has sinceissued a statementoutlining his views on trans rights and calling on the writers who have withdrawn their nominations to restore themselves to the longlist, writing that he has “shelves full of awards at home” and that while he would not withdraw, he would ask the judges not to shortlist him. Perhaps some writers will take up this offer. But from where I stand, the response is not for Boyne to propose, as this action is not specifically about him – it is about Polari as an institution.Where does it go from here? This year’s prizes are still going ahead and a “shortlist” will still, somehow, be forged from the depleted pool of authors (PEN America, under similar circumstances, had the good sense to cancel its awards). Polari has also said it will be “undertaking a full review of the prize processes”, to avoid the “hurt and anger” caused by this year’s awards. I do wonder what that will look like. Poring through the public statements of all authors to ensure that nothing offending has been said? I can only hope that whatever processes are put in place will be sufficient to secure the confidence of the queer writers who have found themselves having to weather abuse and hostility for taking a public stand.Mostly, though, I think – with or without Boyne’s nomination – Polari needs to figure out what it wants to be. If it wants to be a prize that is inclusive of trans-exclusionary views and writers, it is free to do this and must accept that large swaths of the community will find this intolerable and disengage.I suspect that this reluctance to commit is exactly because of that. As the response to this boycott has shown, the swell of public support is behind those who are supportive of the entire LGBTQ+ community. At one time, Polari seemed to recognise this: Bindel herselfhasnoted that in 2021, after “the trans train had chugged into town”, she was told by its organisers that her presence at an event would cause “a major pushback”. Polari finds itself at another crossroads, called upon to tell us what kind of organisation it is and where it really stands. Perhaps bridges will be rebuilt and the community will return, or we will go off and build something else.Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the Guardian.

For the first time in living memory, younger Australians risk facing lower living standards than those before them. This is not acceptable to the union movement, so our one big idea is to rebalance the tax system so that productivity gains are fairly shared, housing becomes more affordable and essential services are properly funded.Australia’s current tax system is exploited by big business and the ultra-wealthy, entrenching intergenerational inequality and placing affordable housing out of young workers’ reach, which threatens the services and infrastructure we all rely on.We need a minimum 25% tax on gas export revenues, a minimum 25% tax for trust funds and individuals earning more than $1m, and a one investment property limit for negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount benefits, with the grandfathering of current arrangements for five years. These changes have a simple intention: to make sure everyone pays their fair share, so productivity gains flow across society fairly.What are the benefits?These proposed reforms would help restore fairness and opportunity for young Australians to get ahead in their lives.Is AI going to steal your job? Not if you work in cleaning, construction or hospitality, Australian report findsRead moreFor the past 25 years, productivity increases have gone back into company profits, shareholder dividends, share buybacks and executive bonuses. Working people know that every time they check their bank accounts, there is no “direct debit system” where the extra profits generated by increased productivity are automatically shared with them.Australia is a rich country but, for decades, as the “economic pie” has got bigger, corporations have not just taken their own bigger slice, they have been eating into ours. The way to stop this is to make sure workers have strong rights at work to get the pay rises they deserve and to make sure our tax system ensures everyone – not just the ordinary worker – pays their fair share of taxes.There are flaws in our tax system that disadvantage younger Australians and reinforce intergenerational inequity. Just1% of taxpayers own 25% of investment properties, fuelling house prices, skyrocketing rents and putting home ownership out of reach. House prices have gone up at twice the rate of wages in the last 25 years. The result? Workers can no longer afford to live near their jobs, while young people face high rents and are priced out of buying homes. It is true that housing supply needs to increase, but the tax system is adding to the affordability problem and that needs to change.What are the downsides?The loudest complaints will come from those who have gamed the system to accumulate enormous economic and political power. Australia’s economy is dominated by an artificially inflated property market, in addition to a small number of large companies in a small number of industries.Claims that working people will automatically be better off if productivity increases are wrong.Dr Jim Stanford’s recent paperon productivity shows that if real wages had grown at the same rate of productivity since 2000, average wages would be 18% – or $350 per week – higher than they are now.What you won’t hear from big business is the real reason productivity growth in Australia has been slow: they have prioritised distributing profits rather than investing in capital, research and people.Commonwealth Bank urged to repay fees of 2 million low-income customers after posting record profitRead moreWorkers’ rights are not “red tape”, they are the way we get pay rises and limits on working hours. They are essential to workers benefiting from the productivity gains our hard work creates. If we take them away, workers will get even less.How practical is it?Our proposed reforms are targeted and achievable. These are simple changes that close loopholes and restore balance, because we recognise that the problem isn’t everyday investors who are looking to build a nest egg with a housing investment, the problem is that the current tax system rewards investing in housing as an asset class so the richest mega-investors are accumulating a large number of properties, tying up capital that could be invested in things that contribute to productivity growth and forcing property prices up beyond what any ordinary working person can afford.How politically risky is it?Working people pay their fair share of tax, we just want everyone else to as well. Ninety-one people with an income over $1m paid no income tax in 2022-23. Not one cent! When the very wealthy pay less tax than a bus driver or an aged care worker, something is very wrong. Trust funds have also become tax minimisation schemes for rich people, and mega-profitable resource companies are also getting away with paying little or no corporate tax. Our proposals are about ensuring the economy works for those who actually keep it running: working people.Sally McManus is a trade unionist and political activist who has served as the secretary of the Australia Council of Trade Unions since 2017Explore more on these topicsAustralian economyOne Big IdeaAustralian trade unionsLabor partyAustralian politicsBusinesscommentShareReuse this content"

One, demanding mastery of gear stick, accelerator and clutch – greater control at the risk of stalling – the other offering a simpler ride.These days the debate has moved on. The majority of new cars are automatic and an increasing shareare electric.New data from the Electric Vehicle Council shows sales of electric vehicles continue to climb in Australia, with 12% of new sales between January and June being battery electric or plug-in hybrids – up from 9.6% in the same period last year.As a new generation approaches their Ls and Ps, a new dilemma arises – is it better to learn in an electric or a petrol vehicle?What do the rules say about learning in an EV?There arenow 350,000 electric carson Australian roads, says the Electric Vehicle Council’s chief executive, Julie Delvecchio. Of those, about 43% are driven in outer suburban Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane – often households with solar panels, off-street parking and longer commutes – and 18% in the regions, she says.A burning issue: why it’s time to ditch the wood-fired heater and opt for eco alternativesRead more“Given that the future of driving is electric, it just makes sense that we’d be teaching our kids on the cars that they’ll be actually using in the years ahead.”In most states, learners can drive any light car, so long as they are supervised by someone with a full Australian driver’s licence.Once on their probationary licence – in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia – young drivers are banned from getting behind the wheel of anything classed as a high-powered vehicle. The restriction applies to any vehicle with a power-to-weight ratio higher than 130 kilowatts per tonne, which rules out some popular electric models like Tesla’s Model Y,according to EV Central.When it comes to motorcycles, many states still require learners to start with a petrol vehicle, says Dr Chris Jones, president of the Australian Electric Vehicle Association.“If you’re going to learn how to ride a motorcycle and you want to get your open bike license – which means unrestricted power-to-weight – you do need to do that on a petrol bike with gears and a clutch. You can’t do that on an EV motorcycle,” he says.Can I sit my test in an EV?Students can take their test in an electric car, according to state and territory transport departments. However, restrictions on the use of driver support systems vary, so it’s worth checking the rules for your state or territory beforehand.For example, in NSW driver support features such as self-parking, speed assist and cruise control must be turned off during the driving test, while in Queensland they can still be used.Some jurisdictions require the car to have a centre-mounted park brake – electric or lever – to be accessible from the front passenger seat.What are the pros and cons?Tarik Menzies from No Yelling Driving School, who manages a fleet of driving instructors across Queensland and Victoria, says occasionally parents will request their child learns in a petrol car.For some it’s about manual transmission, he says, a feature rarely found in electric vehicles. “They think their child learning manual is a useful skill – like doing maths without the calculator.”Learning in a manual is increasingly uncommon, however.Transportfor NSW data shows in 2024 the number of manual driving tests (28,392) was a tenth of the amount of automatic tests (289,426).Others are not yet ready for the change in technology, Menzies says – even though when it comes to automatic cars, there’s very little difference between learning in an electric versus a petrol car.Kathryn Collier, who manages METEC Driver Training, says there’s a couple of small differences for learners to be aware of. Electric cars often have better torque and can be quicker off the mark, she says.“Also be aware that your car may well be silent. So be extra vigilant in looking out for vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists because they won’t hear you.”The road safety organisation, which provides school driver programs for more than 80 schools in Melbourne and Victoria, has a range of vehicles for students to learn in, including a Nissan Leaf, to give young people the experience of driving an electric vehicle.So which one is better to learn in?Parents switching to a shiny new electric car might be tempted to hold on to their older model for their teenagers to learn in.But Collier recommends young drivers learn in “the safest car you can afford”, ideally one with a five-star Ancap rating.“A lot of young people tend to get the hand-me-down vehicles from other members of the family,” she says. “We would argue that the most vulnerable driver should really be in the safest car possible.”Jones says the learning process is a good opportunity to share tips about the “non-driving bits” of driving an EV – how to use a public charger, charging etiquette and scheduling your home charging to make the most of cheap energy.“In our experience learner drivers (and drivers generally) adapt pretty quickly when it comes to EVs”, the Electric Vehicle Council’s Julie Delvecchio says. “Often, once they get in an EV … they never want to go back to petrol and diesel, because it’s so smooth, so quiet and easy to drive.”Regardless of what car they learn in, Menzies says learning to drive is an empowering experience for most young people. “We see the joy that it brings, as well as the disappointment when they fail.”“In our culture, getting your licence is somewhat of a right of passage for the young person becoming a big person.”Share your experiencePlease share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Luckily, it’s all being kept very privateFri 15 Aug 2025 08.49 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 16.00 EDTShareWhat is “Brand Beckham”? I don’t mean to question the very idea of a celebrity brand – far from it. In fact, part of the reason that celeb-watching phrases like “the brand” and “controlling the narrative” have gone completely mainstream is because of David andVictoria Beckham. So ubiquitous is the professionalisation of celebrity these days, and so media-literate is the public, that it’s hard to remember just how revolutionary the Beckhams were in British culture back in the day. Twenty-five years ago, nobody except some rarefied elite publicist wanged on about narratives. But now everyone knows how to read an influencer. Almost all celebrities are regarded primarily as people who are selling something. Furthermore, people act like mis-selling a lifestyle is worse than several major financial crimes.Anyway, back to the brand. What is the Beckham brand? Not their many specific product brands, nor the many other ones to which they lend their images for advertising. The thing I’m talking about is more like a movie star’s screen persona. The unifying characteristic, the theme that permeates all their roles, the magic that fans go back for. In the case of the Beckhams, the brand is really their family. Two became six.In the more distant past, this meant Victoria and David selling news of their pregnancies to OK! magazine, then selling the first baby photos and so on. In the age of Instagram, as their children have grown up, it has meant constantly tending this idyllic image by posting private family moments, having everyone show up en masse for the launch of each other’s football seasons/fashion shows/face primers/food lines/50th birthday marathons, and dutifully sending daily public messages of love, support and thanks to each other across social media platforms where others can see them. Whether it’s family or business – and sometimes it isn’t entirely clear where the dividing line is – it’s all very much the family business.As distilled in David’s Netflix documentary – self-commissioned, naturally – the message is that no matter what triumph or disaster comes their way, the Beckham family are about each other. Any adversity is folded into their story and ends up being repurposed into (lucrative) triumph because this is a family that sticks together, and which draws its strength from that. It’s aspirational and sometimes charming. It has worked.So what happens when a gaping hole is blown in the idyll? In some of the most eye-popping showbiz news of the summer, it has emerged beyond all doubt that one of the family – firstborn Brooklyn – wants nothing to do with the others. If the idea of a feud was plausibly deniable back when Brooklyn and his wife, Nicola Peltz, got married three years ago, it was harder to maintain when the pair didn’t show up for any of David’s 50th birthday celebrations this May. It is now impossible, following Brooklyn and Nicola’s decision to post to Instagram huge numbers of photos of their very recentwedding vow renewal ceremony. (Vow renewals: another part of modern celeb culture that didn’t really happen before they happened in magazine buy-ups or on social media.) Details of the lavish big day? The ceremony was officiated by Nicola’s billionaire father, Nelson, and she wore her mother’s wedding dress. Oh, and not a single member of the Beckham family was there, and it’s said they only found out about it by reading it online.Questions abound, from various sides of the fence. To a list of occupations which already includes footballer, photographer, model,monograph authorand chef, is Brooklyn adding hostage? How can the Beckhams bear the pain of rejection? Or do people really cut themselves off from highly functional families? One of Nicola’s friends who attended the ceremony posted in praise of having “the guts to walk away” from “a toxic family”. Victoria’s own self-commissionedNetflix documentarywas due to come out this autumn (executive producer: David Beckham). How on earth is it going to spin this? Anything other than four hours of open-heart soul-searching is going to look a bit “Tractor production up in Volgograd!”The cautionary sadness is that these questions can’t really be considered invasive because they relate to a show the Beckhams have eagerly invited us to watch at every possible moment. The family has so assiduously cultivated the public engagement with their internal dynamics, choosing daily to live out loud across social media. For better – but now, for worse. It feels a little much to slap the adjective “Shakespearean” on a story which involves a guy who once included the worst picture ever taken of an elephant ina coffee-table bookof his own photography (launch party held at Christie’s London). But there is certainly a tragic irony that social media, which the Beckhams have hitherto controlled so masterfully – has been the place that exposed their schisms.They were undone by omission, given that one of the other things our first family have embodied is a complete shift in showbiz journalism. So much entertainment coverage now comes from parsing who is or isn’t tagged in Instagram posts, who has stopped following who, who omitted to like this or that. And anyone can do this. It’s a form of mass Kremlinology.At the peak of their tabloid fame – or the first peak, perhaps we should say now – it became commonplace to suggest that in the modern era, the Beckhams were our real royal family. They seemed a reaction against all that old blood, that nepo privilege, that public repression of private truth. But now? Well, perhaps some of the plotlines are converging. Perhaps the House of Windsor and the House of Beckham are not so different after all.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

On Friday, there will be a two-minute silence at noon in the UK to honour the 80th anniversary of VJ Day. This is a moment not only for solemn remembrance, but also for reflection on the enduring bonds forged in the crucible of history – bonds that continue to resonate in our world today.At the darkest hour of the second world war, China and the UK fought on different frontsbut shared a common mission: to defend humanity against fascism and aggression. Millions of lives were lost, cities razed, and families torn apart. Yet in that darkness, courage and solidarity illuminated the way forward. The Chinese and British peoples stood shoulder to shoulder, united by sacrifice and a shared belief in freedom and justice.In Asia, Chinese forces made immense sacrifices to support allied efforts. In 1942, the Chinese Expeditionary Force marched over 1,500 gruelling kilometres through the jungles of Myanmarto rescue British forces trapped by Japanese troops. The campaign was costly, but it demonstrated China’s unwavering commitment to its allies.In Britain, thousands of Chinese seamen served with quiet courage in perilous convoys. They braved the freezing Atlantic to deliver fuel and supplies to British forces on the frontlines – often with little recognition and no promise of return. Their contribution remains a poignant chapter in our shared wartime history.One of the most moving examples of China-UK solidarity occurred in October 1942, when theLisbon Maru, a Japanese transport vessel carrying over 1,800 British prisoners of war, was mistakenly torpedoed by a US submarine. As the ship sank off the coast of Zhoushan in eastern China, local fishermen risked their lives, dodging volleys of Japanese gunfire, to rescue 384 survivors from the sea.In a letter to a family member ofa Lisbon Marusurvivor, President Xi Jinping commended this act of compassion and bravery as powerful proof of the wartime alliance between our countries and the enduring friendship between our peoples. Earlier this year, the story was brought to life for British audiencesin a documentary, The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru.View image in fullscreenPoster for The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru (2024)Photograph: Emei Film GroupBritish support for China’s resistance against Japanese aggression is equally etched in our collective memory. Across the UK, ordinary citizens formed aid organisations, held fundraisers, and sent donations to support the Chinese people. Among the most cherished names is George Hogg, a young man from Harpenden (aone-time reporterfor the Manchester Guardian). He journeyed to China to provide schooling and shelter for displaced children, dedicating his youth, passion and ultimately his life to a just cause. His internationalist spirit remains deeply cherished by the Chinese people.These moments of solidarity continue to inspire our relations today. Both China and the UK are permanent members of the UN security council, sharing a responsibility to uphold international peace and security. The UK was the first major western country to recognise the People’s Republic of China. Since we established full diplomatic ties in 1972, our people-to-people exchanges have flourished. In 2024, over 1.2m mutual visits were made. More than 200,000 Chinese studentsare studying in the UK, while over 50,000 British studentshave visited China for study programmes– long or short – over the past decade. Just last month, nearly 1,200 students from 61 UK secondary schools visited Chinaon an exchange programme– experiencing first-hand a millennia-old culture. In both countries, there is growing enthusiasm for more dialogue and engagement.With concerted efforts, China-UK relations have been put back on a path of improvement and renewal. At a time of global uncertainty, it is more important than ever to reaffirm our commitment to partnership. That means treating each other with mutual respect, managing differences properly, and responding to the aspirations of our peoples.It also means we need to deliver the outcomes of bilateral mechanisms such as the strategic dialogue, economic and financial dialogue, and energy dialogue, and also eliminate distractions, expand channels of communication, and strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation.Just as vital is our joint responsibility to safeguard the hard-won outcomes of the second world war and to uphold true multilateralism and an open global trading system. By working more closely to address global challenges like climate change and promote political solutions to regional hotspot issues, China and the UK can help inject new momentum into global peace and development.History has shown what China and the UK can achieve when we stand together. As we commemorate this historic anniversary, China is ready to work with the UK to carry forward the legacy of those who came before us.Let us honour the past not with nostalgia, but with action, telling the stories of courage and friendship that inspire new generations. Let us build a future where peace and prosperity prevail.The torch of friendship and solidarity, lit eight decades ago, must now light the way forward – for our two countries, for our peoples and for the world at large.Zheng Zeguang is Chinese ambassador to the UKDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But it was a very particular kind of failure she feared; one that follows a very particular kind of success. Living up to the fact of being Scotland’s first female first minister became, she writes in her new memoir, “almost an obsession”, which is arguably unhealthy but not unreasonable. To be the first woman (or indeed the first minority) in any field is to be uncomfortably aware of being on probation: the test case that sceptics will use to decide whether women in general can really hack it, but also the yardstick by which other women will judge whether representation actually makes a difference.You daren’t betray anything that looks like a sign of weakness, yet at the same time you’re endlessly under pressure to spill your guts on all the intimate stuff – miscarriage and menopause in Sturgeon’s case, pregnancy in high office for New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern, also the author of arecent memoir– lest other women feel you’re either holding out on useful information, making it all look too infuriatingly easy, or failing to do your bit to break some taboo. (Even Sturgeon, in an interview this week with the midlife women’spodcast The Shift, expressed surprise that, when she was figuring out how to manage menopausal symptoms in office, she couldn’t find anything to read about how other senior politicians had coped.) Suddenly, you’re not just a woman but an everywoman, supposed to magically embody every female voter who ever existed, even on issues where women in real life are impossibly divided – as they were over trans rights, the issue that ultimately holed Sturgeon’s premiership below the waterline.Representation can be a blessing and curse, even for a politician as gifted as Sturgeon undoubtedly has been. But is it also ultimately a distraction?Her book completes a trio of recent memoirs, alongside those of Ardern and Germany’sAngela Merkel, which feel like a final full stop on the end of an era in which putting a woman in power was expected somehow to change everything. All three at their peak were somewhat romantically held aloft as examples of a kinder, more emotionally literate politics: Merkel for opening her arms to Syrian refugees; Ardern for the unifying way sheled her countrythrough the immediate and potentially divisive aftermath of the Christchurch terrorist massacre;and Sturgeon for being the remain voter’s feminist yin to Boris Johnson’s laddish Brexiter yang.All three functioned at times as queens across the water for English leftwingers, wondering wistfully why they couldn’t have a leader like that. During the 2015 televised election debates in which Sturgeon took part, viewers furiously Googled whether it was possible to vote SNP south of the border. Merkel’s principled pushback against Donald Trump in his first presidency – remember that iconic image of herlooming commandinglyover a seated Trump at a G7 summit? – was as much admired and envied in parts of the UK as Ardern’s “zero Covid strategy” of sealing borders, at least until the latter was overwhelmed by new variants.Yet all three became bitterly polarising figures in time, as Sturgeon herself acknowledged to The Shift’s Sam Baker. The nature of the tribe in charge might have changed, but not the angry tribalism endemic in politics: so much for the patronising Barbieworld fantasy that if women ran the world, peace and love would rule the day.With hindsight, though, what all three of those pioneer female leaders really represented was a longing for someone to break the mould, and that hasn’t gone away. If anything, the impatience and frustration with mainstream politics building up in younger women suggests it is intensifying.Nicola Sturgeon’s immense political talent is undeniable. The nationalism was the problem | Martin KettleRead moreThe Scottish journalist Alex Massiewrote this week of the English tendency to idolise Sturgeon from a distance, even as Scots who experienced her government’s failings up close were losing patience with it. As an English journalist, I have to concede some truth in that. From a distance, it’s too easy to get hung up on the performance of leadership, at which she genuinely did excel, and forget about what it actually feels like to be governed by someone day in and day out. During the pandemic, I remember envying the way Scottish lockdown restrictions took into account children’s need for play, but more broadly the thought and seriousness that seemed to be going into Sturgeon’s policymaking when Johnson was still making jokes about squashing sombreros or turning a blind eye to drunken parties.Yet death rates in Scotlandweren’t noticeably betterthan in England, for reasons the Covid inquiry is still exploring. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, Ardern was failing to hit her much-vauntedtargets on child poverty, a reminder that personal values don’t necessarily trump the realities of a post-lockdown economy.The obvious moral to be drawn from all of this is that putting women on a pedestal simply because they’re women makes no more sense than taking lumps out of them for the same reason: that in a mature democracy, they would be judged simply on results. Since the least interesting thing about Kemi Badenoch’s increasingly erratic leadership of the Conservative party is her gender, perhaps it’s not too much to hope that we’re moving in that direction: that the joy of being the third or fourth or fifth woman through the door is that eventually people simply cease to care. But, if so, it will be the Sturgeons and the Arderns and the Merkels, with all their flaws, who paved the way.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s time to get offline and talk to each otherAlexander HurstIt’s tempting to scoff, but don’t dismiss the data. Modern man’s failure to forge real, meaningful friendships is bad for everyoneFri 15 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 07.47 EDTShareAt first I was startled when the psychologist Angelica Ferrara told me that most of the time it’s women, not men, who want to write abouther researchinto male loneliness. But this is the crux of the issue, isn’t it? That we men need to talk, and we don’t: not nearly enough, anyway.Since 1990, there has been a sharp decline in how many people men say they are close to, says Ferrara, who is a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford and a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics. In the US, two-thirds of men aged between 18 and 23 think thatnobody really knows them; one thirdhaven’t seen anyoneoutside their household in the past week; only afifth say they have friends they can really count on; and a staggering69% of young menthink “no one cares if men are OK”.Of course, women also experience this same loneliness, isolation and disconnection – at rates that are not far behind their male counterparts. In addition, many women in relationships with men find themselves doing something that Ferrara has named “mankeeping”, a term that hasrecently gone viral: picking up the emotional weight of being their male partner’s only intimate social connection. With this in mind, Ferrara has had her work dismissed as “himpathy” – in other words, too kind to adult men who should be able to look after themselves.While I understand the reflex to lash out and ask, “Why should a bunch of incels get so much attention?”, such a dismissal is a mistake. “Our lives are so interlinked,” as Ferrara put it to me: men’s failures to maintain close connections are hurting society at large.Since 2017, there has been amarked increasein the number of men inhabiting what some researchers refer to as the “man box”. That is, men who have deeply misogynistic beliefs about masculinity and gender roles: who want to know where their wife or girlfriend is at all times, who think they should always have the final say in a relationship, and who think gay men “are not real men”. The same survey found that 63% of men wished they were more “masculine”.Let me address men directly: this is our problem and our responsibility. We need to find a way out of this, and I think that starts with separating masculinity from “domination”. For too many men, domination is where masculinity is grounded. Dominating conversations online and offline, dominating the physical space around them, dominating women (“Your body, my choice,”Nick Fuentes tweetedafter Donald Trump’s second election victory). An identity formed around domination was always going to damage men, because it is fundamentally at odds with community. I think community is what whole swathes of alienated westerners are really yearning for deep down.In fact, I’d go so far as to say that domination is not only at odds with community, but with true confidence. Domination is something that the insecure seek as a means to generate confidence; the truly confident do not need it. Disturbingly, Taveeshi Gupta, the senior director of research at Equimundo, says being in the man box often correlates with a better sense of purpose, because men identify with the roles of provider and protector – an identification that women place on to men too, Gupta says. But what if we could get the same result by reframing this as care?“Men talk about their friendships with a lot of desire for what isnotthere,” says Ferrara, who, as part of her research, has conducted hundreds of interviews with men and their romantic partners. “One of the stereotypes that I combat, and that men combat too, is that men don’t need closeness.” I have male friendships whose natural setting is banter, and I have male friendships that involve deeper intellectual and emotional sharing, where we have found the space to just sit and talk, orrefaire le monde, as the French are fond of saying: to set the world straight.I do wonder if the ability to cultivate deeper connections can be taught. Ferrara and I are roughly the same age, and both from the US; neither of us encountered any kind of unit on identifying and discussing emotions in our elementary schooling. But she hit me with something surprising: among the men she has interviewed whodoreport having close relationships, a fair number of them (including a curious concentration of Canadians in particular) did talk about emotions and relationships at school.“There aren’t enough scripts for raising boys,” says Gupta. At an extremely young age, they talk openly about how they “love” their male friends, she says, and then society whisks that away from them and shoves them into a world where “they can’t have these relationships”. Sometimes that means literal scripts as well: Ferrara told me she could recall multiple examples from her childhood and adolescence of pop culture showing women discussing their feelings with each other, in shows such as Sex and the City. We both paused for a moment and tried to think of similar examples involving men. I couldn’t. Neither could she.We live in a cynical age, thick with essays about newly coined terms such as “heterofatalists”: people who are fed up with modern dating and are convinced there are no more “good men”. It is an age where the “manosphere” is full of grifters ready to prey on men’s loneliness and need for connection by selling them poor substitutes for real community, such as the sad bravado of masculinism. It would be devastating if all of this became a self-fulfilling narrative.It’s up to us – to men – to change the narrative. It has become a truism that it is tough to begin deep friendships later on in life, once we’re far away from the crucible of shared classrooms or university campuses. But it’s on us to make the effort to change this: to reach out, to ask deeper questions, to create that absent sense of community – hopefully in offline “third spaces” rather than online ones. We may not have had to face a glass ceiling above us, but too often we’ve put ourselves behind glass walls of our own making. Let’s shatter them.Alexander Hurst is a GuardianEuropecolumnistExplore more on these topicsMenOpinionPsychologyLonelinessEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Our reunion this winter in Melbourne should have been pure joy – a celebration of survival and friendship – but it began in the quiet rows of a Muslim graveyard. We were there for the funeral of our mutual friend, Barez.I saw the grief on their faces as we stood for the final prayers. “It is so sad,” Simon said softly, his voice carrying that mix of resignation and wisdom you only hear from people who have faced loss head on.Later that afternoon, driving through Melbourne’s southern suburbs, we joined other Reuters colleagues for lunch at an Afghan restaurant. The scent of cardamom rice, grilled kebabs and freshly baked naan wrapped around us like a memory. Over green tea, we slipped into the past – and suddenly I was back in Kabul on 15 August 2021.Let me explain, my dear son, why I left you in Afghanistan. Hang in there, I have not given up  | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreAt midday I was sipping pomegranate juice at a roadside cafe in the heart of the city, just across the street from the Presidential Palace. It was a hot, tense day. Rumours had swirled since dawn: Taliban fighters were advancing on the capital, checkpoint after checkpoint falling to them without a shot fired.The sound came suddenly – the sharp crackle of gunfire. It seemed to come from everywhere at once. Panic spread like a shockwave through the street.For months Afghans had lived under the shadow of the US withdrawal but no one imagined the end would come this quickly. Only that morning government officials were assuring the public that Kabul was secure. By noon the illusion was gone.I later learned the shots came from a bank, where security guards fired AK-47s into the air to control a desperate crowd of customers trying to withdraw their savings. But in that moment we all assumed the worst – that Taliban fighters were already here, storming the heart of the city.I left my half-finished glass on the table, paid the bill and ran for my car. Within hours the Taliban were in control of police stations, hoisting their white flags, and establishing checkpoints. Shop shutters slammed shut. The city held its breath.Within hours my phone buzzed with a message from Simon Gardner – urgent but calm: “Get to the safehouse now. We will figure out the next steps.”I didn’t know Simon before that day. As a British journalist based in London, his efforts protected not only the lives of reporters on the frontlines but also the very principle of a free press and, in a way, democracy itself. From that first message, he became my lifeline – working contacts, finding routes and keeping me focused when fear threatened to paralyse me.1:10Chaos at Kabul airport as Taliban seize control of Afghan capital – videoFor days I tried to reach Kabul airport. The scenes were apocalyptic – tens of thousands of people crushed against its gates, the roar of military planes, gunshots echoing as desperate crowds surged forward. I returned to the safehouse more than once, my attempts ending in failure and near disaster. Simon never once suggested giving up. “We just had to keep trying,” he says now. “The situation was changing by the hour – we had to adapt.”Eventually I made it out. I had toleave my family behindfor their safety. But reaching Islamabad was only the end of the first chapter. I landed with little more than a backpack and the clothes I was wearing. Weeks turned into months of uncertainty. I couldn’t return to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan – it was too dangerous. But the road ahead was blocked by paperwork, shifting immigration rules and the political realities of resettlement.That’s when James McKenzie entered the picture. A longstanding Reuters colleague from Sydney whom I barely knew, he arrived in Islamabad with a clear mission: to help get Afghan journalists out of limbo.James’s style was different from Simon’s. Where Simon was the strategist, James was the steady hand on the shoulder – the one who kept morale alive. He would spend hours with displaced families, trying out his limited Persian to make everyone smile, explaining complex forms and navigating the wall of bureaucracy that stood between us and safety.The process was gruelling but somehow, between Simon’s network and James’s persistence, the impossible became possible. Months later I stepped off a plane on to Australian soil.View image in fullscreenA token of appreciationNow, four years later, hosting the two in Melbourne – where I feel at home – was heartwarming. At the Afghan restaurant I gave Simon and James a small gift: coins engraved with the name of Dorothea Mackellar, the Australian poet whose words for me capture the contradictions of belonging to more than one land.I love a sunburnt country,A land of sweeping plains,Of ragged mountain ranges,Of droughts and flooding rainsShadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

The Strictly class of 2025 has now been unveiled in full.As always, optimistically rumoured big names failed to materialise. There’s no politician, no newsreader, no minor royal. Stacey Solomon, Rob Brydon, Monica Galetti, Tom Parker-Bowles, Mo Farah and pretty much anyone who’s ever been on The Traitors were all hotly tipped but haven’t transpired. Anyone would think they didn’t want to have their sticky-out bottoms and sticky-up thumbs critiqued in front of millions.So which 15 celebrities (we deploy the term loosely) will be getting Spanx-clad and sequin-spangled on autumnal Saturday nights? Who could get their jazz hands on the glitterball trophy? Who’ll be sent home before their fake tan has dried? We’ve rated this year’s ballroom batch from worst to best in terms of likely sparkly success.15.Ross KingView image in fullscreenRoss King.Photograph: BBC/PAThe celeb bookers totally wanted Ross Kemp, didn’t they? All it took was one typo in an email and here we are. The Los Angeles correspondent on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine bills himself as “the King of Hollywood”.

We’ll see about that …14.Chris RobshawView image in fullscreenChris Robshaw.Photograph: PHOTOGRAPHER:/BBCEx-England rugby union captain Robshaw is the ninth rugger bugger to swap oval balls for glitterballs. None have ever lifted the trophy, with 2006 runner-up Matt Dawson coming closest. Could he become the second consecutive Chris to win (after McCausland) and the third Chris overall (see also Hollins)? As a self-confessed “dad dancer”, no. He’ll likely lumber around like a teak wardrobe with a groin strain. Soz.13.Jimmy Floyd HasselbainkView image in fullscreenJimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.Photograph: BBC/PADespite all those kicks, flicks and tricks, male footballers traditionally fare even worse than rugby players. Only Robbie Savage has passed the contest’s midway mark and he’s half-afghan hound. Former Leeds, Chelsea and Netherlands striker Hasselbaink signed up to impress his Strictly-mad daughters. They should enjoy his participation while it lasts. A contender for the sparkly handled wooden spoon. “Don’t Hassle the Baink” won’t even become a catchphrase, sadly.12.Thomas SkinnerView image in fullscreenThomas Skinner.Photograph: BBC/PABosh. In one of the more curious career trajectories of recent times, Essex pillow salesman Skinner shot to cult fame on the 2019 series of The Apprentice. He’s since become a populist influencer who praises Donald Trump and struck up an unlikely friendship with JD Vance, while slating Labour, Just Stop Oil and the “woke brigade™”. Mainly, though, he posts his massive artery-clogging breakfasts on social media, always ending with his catchphrase “Bosh”. He’s Del Boy for the TikTok generation. Farage in Reebok Classics and a puffy gilet. Can he dance? He’ll give it a go for Britain. Bosh again!11.Balvinder SopalView image in fullscreenBalvinder Sopal.Photograph: PHOTOGRAPHER:/BBCFrom Walford to Waltzford, from duff-duffs to cha-chas. Recruiting from EastEnders, Strictly’s Elstree Studios neighbour, is an annual tradition but it backfired last year afterJamie Borthwick was suspended from the soap after a video showing him using an ableist slur while on set at Strictly.Balvinder, AKA soap matriarch Suki Panesar, is way too smart for such idiotic gaffes. Theatrical and elegant, she’s also become an LGBTQ+ heroine as one half of lesbian couple “Sukeve”. Let’s hope she makes it to Halloween so she can be “Spooky Suki”.10.Harry Aikines-AryeeteyView image in fullscreenHarry Aikines-Aryeetey.Photograph: BBC/PADave Arch’s band, ready! Contender, ready! First out of the sparkly starting blocks was Nitro from Gladiators, AKA former Olympic sprinter Harry Aikines-Aryeetey. His glorified audition was the Christmas special, when he threw Nancy Xu around like she was an Elf On A Shelf, pulled off some “pec-ography” and came a creditable second. His Spandex-clad colleague, Montell “Fire” Douglas, reached the quarter-final last year and he could do likewise. Expect muscly stripping, pugil stick props and (hopefully) the running man on a travelator.9.La VoixView image in fullscreenLa Voix.Photograph: PHOTOGRAPHER:/BBCVoilà, it’s La Voix.

La Voix, AKA Christopher Dennis from County Durham, was runner-up on last year’s Drag Race UK and Britain’s Got Talent semi-finalist. She’s trained in musical theatre, will look fabulous and generally slay but will La Voix get La Votes?8.Kristian NairnView image in fullscreenKristian Nairn.Photograph: BBC/PAHold the stage door, it’s Hodor the hoofer. Casting the Game of Thrones cult hero is a curveball that even Bran Stark didn’t see coming. Nairn admits: “This will be a huge challenge for me physically but I’m ready to rise to it.” The gentle giant has a thriving side hustle as a house DJ, so rhythm and musicality should be strengths. He’s also a total dude with a winning sense of humour, so will win over Westeros novices. Expect a cockle-warming journey of weight loss, self-discovery and dragon-themed routines, while various GoT alumni cheer him on from the front row. Winter is coming to the ballroom. You know nothing, Tony Beak.7.Karen CarneyView image in fullscreenKaren Carney.Photograph: BBC/PAThis is the summer of the Lionesses and in the absence of a current player – Leah Williamson was a rumoured target – midfielder-turned-pundit Carney is the next best thing. Expect goodwill in abundance when the Brummie wing wizard laces up her ballroom boots. There’s speculation that she’ll form half of Strictly’s first all-female partnership since 2022 (and only the third ever), which would be a welcome twist. A routine set to Sweet Caroline or Freed From Desire would blow the Elstree Studios roof off. Bring on the 4am karaoke sessions and victory parades.6.George ClarkeView image in fullscreenGeorge Clarke.Photograph: BBC/PANot to be confused with the Channel 4 property presenter and treehouse-botherer, this one is a YouTuber also known as “George Clarkey”. Honestly, I don’t know how they dream up these crazy nicknames. His comedy skits and Useless Hotline Podcast have seen him amass millions of followers. He’s played down his dance ability – saying he’ll “potentially fall over a fair bit” and “I once ordered pasodoble at a Spanish restaurant” – but the yoof vote could carry him to the final, à la Joe Sugg in 2018. Don’t forget to like and subscribe, guys. Guys?5.Vicky PattisonView image in fullscreenVicky Pattison.Photograph: BBC/PAShe’s been crowned Queen Of The Jungle on I’m a Celeb. Will she now be Queen Of The Jive? Canny lass Pattison found fame on Geordie Shore but has since carved out an impressive career as a documentary-maker, author, campaigner and presenter. Far brighter and funnier than reality stars are often given credit for, she could go even further than her mate Pete Wicks last year. It’ll also be fun watching her pro partner being baffled by her Tyneside accent. “What are these stottie cakes and broon ales?”4.Stefan DennisView image in fullscreenStefan Dennis.Photograph: BBC/PAStrewth, mate, it’s Paul Robinson from Neighbours. The bad-boy businessman and Ramsay Street Lothario is basically Ian Beale without the blubbing. He’s starred in West End musicals and had a pop career (who can forget his 1989 hit Don’t It Make You Feel Good?), so can hoof a bit. Jason Donovan, who played his on-screen brother Scott, reached the final. Could Erinsborough’s elder statesman find the perfect blend? He hails from Tawonga in Victoria, not far from judge Craig Revel Horwood’s home town of Ballarat, so could call in local favours in return for free drinks at Lassiters.3.Alex KingstonView image in fullscreenAlex Kingston.Photograph: BBC/PAWhile her fellow contestants supplied the usual platitudes about “comfort zones” and “being Strictly-fied”, Kingston’s quote on her official BBC announcement simply said: “Aaaaagghhh!!!!!!” We like her already. The ER and Doctor Who star was inspired to sign up by her pal Sarah Hadland, a runner-up last year. At 62, she might be the field’s oldest female but don’t bet against her. Classy casting. In your face, Dancing On Ice.2.Dani DyerView image in fullscreenDani Dyer.Photograph: BBC/PAOwn up, who else’s heart skipped a beat when they heard this name? So close to Danny Dyer doing a samba and yet so far. Sadly, he once said: “I get offered Strictly every year but I’ve got no desire to be mincing around in sequins.” Still, the daughter of the beloved cockney thesp is a decent signing in her own right. She’s fresh from the first dance at her wedding to West Ham captain Jarrod Bowen and sweetly describes Strictly as “the second most amazing thing I’ve done this year”. As a Love Island winner, Dyer Jr has form for triumphing in reality contests. We predict a waltz to Hammers anthem I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles, while her dad gets weepy in the front row.1.Ellie GoldsteinView image in fullscreenEllie Goldstein.Photograph: PRShe was the first model with Down’s syndrome to grace the cover of Vogue and partnered with Mattel to launch the first Barbie doll with Down’s syndrome. Now trailblazer Ellie Goldstein notches up another milestone by becoming the first Strictly contestant with Down’s syndrome. She’s already requested Nikita Kuzmin as her pro partner because “he’s hot and fit”. Don’t beat around the bush, Ellie, say what you mean. The irrepressible 23-year-old recently branched out into acting on CBBC’s Malory Towers. The myth-busting Mencap ambassador has the charisma, confidence and talent to make her bookies’ early favourite. It’s another step forward for inclusivity and could be the feelgood story of the autumn.Explore more on these topicsStrictly Come DancingTelevisionEntertainment TVBBCReality TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A hot comb sizzling fresh from the stove, the gentle whirring of a sewing machine. A group of women cross-legged on the floor, swapping clothes and gossip: who got turned away at the club door last weekend? Who might show up tonight?For the London-based archivist Deborah Carnegie, there is something atavistic and sacred about the pre-night out ritual, in particular for Black British women. It is the subject of her latest work, a photography archive spanning 1950 to the present day, chronicling Black British women’s Saturday night fashion across the decades.Presented for the first time at this summer’s London College of Fashion’s Fashioning Frequencies exhibition, Carnegie’s collection is the result of months spent gathering images from family photo albums, nightclub photographers’ archives and submissions from friends. (The show has now closed; Carnegie is looking for a new venue to show her photos.)We’re meeting for lunch at Jumbi, one of south-east London’s extant African-Caribbean bars (and a spot I have spent many an evening in, in my Saturday night best; at night it is transformed into a sea of swaying bodies and rum punches under ambient red lights.). “I used to go out round here all the time back in my day,” Carnegie says over plantain and jerk rice. “It’s nice that places like this still exist.“For so long our style has been disparaged as ‘ghetto’,” she says. In the 90s, Carnegie studied fashion as an undergraduate in Surrey. “My teachers at college used to ask me: ‘Who’s going to wear this?’ And I would think: ‘I’ve already got clients!’”Carnegie’s work is a paean to a community whose influence on the country’s fashion she feels has gone underacknowledged. But the subject is personal as well as academic. Growing up in the 60s, she lived with her great-aunt, who ran a nightclub in the cellar of their south London flat.“I’d be in the living room and see guests going downstairs in their fur coats – hair done, jewellery on – and the men in their pinstripe suits and trilby hats,” she says. “My auntie’s rule was that you had to get dressed up if you wanted to go downstairs.”Her great-aunt came to the UK from Jamaica as part of the Windrush generation, and was one of the Britons who helped lay the foundations of a Black British aesthetic. Combining fabrics inspired by Africa, the Caribbean and the UK, there was noticeably more colour in their palettes, compared with the pallid austerity of postwar Britain. At the time, it was seen as outre.The Thurrock Gazette reported in 1948:“Dressed in an odd assortment of clothes, many wearing ties of dazzling designs, over 450 Jamaicans arrived at Tilbury Docks on the Empire Windrush.”“Colour wasn’t as popular in the UK, so we used to make our own outfits out of materials for tablecloths: the greens, blues, oranges,” Carnegie says; they were “inspired by the front rooms in the Caribbean”. Money was an issue but no obstacle to style. “Back in the day, we just made our clothes ourselves,” she says. “We were poor, and most of the dresses didn’t fit our bodies anyway – we had big tits and big bums – so clothes here just didn’t fit us right.”There is a warm familiarity in the images. We may not be hot-combing our hair and reupholstering tablecloths any more, but there is still a thread of continuity running through the 70 years of nightlife documented in Carnegie’s archive, whether it’s getting ready to step on to the linoleum of a 1950s blues night, or a 2000s Afrobeats weekender.“Hair is still a focal point,” she says, “and dressing head-to-toe: the lashes, the nails, too.” Black British women remain, according to Carnegie, tastemakers when it comes to fashion. You only need to look at the pervasiveness of trainer culture, oversized hoops or the slick-back bun in recent years to see her point.“That has always been the way,” she says. “When I was growing up, I never saw Black women on the runway or in magazines. But we’ve always been at the forefront. When we weren’t allowed in those spaces, we made Saturday night our catwalk.”Saturday night life: images from the collectionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Deborah CarnegieA photo of Carnegie’s great-aunt on her wedding day in 1956, this portrait resists tradition. Instead of a white dress, she wore a bespoke suit tailored by her dressmaker, its neat buttons lending elegance and definition, her hair pressed with a hot iron. “She didn’t want a traditional white wedding,” says Carnegie. “The buttons really make the suit and define the look.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It is quintessential 90s.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Deborah CarnegieTaken in 2001, Carnegie, (far right), her sister Sam (second from left) and their friends are shown waiting at a bus stop in Wandsworth on their way to Notting Hill carnival.

Not so in I See You Watching. Here, the male view – in particular the male view of women – is insistent, demanding, explicit.Playing a figure of authoritarian power, actor David Calvitto barks out commands: he wants his women to be pretty, demure, sluttish, compliant, hard-working, domestic, worldly, Madonna and whore. He could be running an audition with a keen eye for what the market demands or, more likely, he could be articulating base male desires.And because he is patrolling the auditorium when he issues these instructions, he is on our side, physically if not politically. Objectified on the other side of the footlights is Kylie Westerbeck, playing a wannabe star in spangly majorette gear, clumsily tossing a baton and dancing with ugly enthusiasm. Calvitto wonders if she could be better.Swiping Right review – punchy questions about dating across the political divideRead moreEager to please, ambitious to succeed, she does her best to obey his contradictory commands. She is fashioned in his image and has no resources to argue back. Conditioned from infancy, she has no thought for herself beyond the empty allure of Hollywood fame.Devised by Westerbeck with director Melanie Stewart and writer John Clancy forBlind Faith Theatre, I See You Watching is an extended riff on a simple idea. The more relentlessly it delves, the more it outlines a spectrum of subjugation: at one end, a woman laughs politely at a man’s unfunny jokes; at the other, a child is farmed out to a pornographer.The production makes its point but, for all the charisma of Westerbeck and Calvitto, it makes it bluntly, hammering home a message in a way that is uncomfortable and unnerving even if it should not come as too much of a surprise.AtGilded Balloon, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalWomenreviewsShareReuse this content"

In a candid interview, she talks about her emotionally gruelling time on I Fought the Law – and why she may never do a role like it againFri 15 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareAcommunity hall in north-east England has been hired for the afternoon to film a scene for one of the standout TV dramas of this year. However, it is off screen – in the cramped kitchen of the building near Hartlepool – that I am seeing one of the most extraordinary and moving tableaux that can have happened on a TV shoot.Standing before a monitor, Ann Ming, a retired surgical nurse, calmly observesSheridan Smithpretending to be her with the uncanny accuracy of appearance and speech that is the actor’s speciality. The shot cuts to a young woman. At this point, the production team tenses: this character is Julie Hogg, Ming’s daughter, who was murdered, aged 22, in 1989. How might someone in their 70s deal with seeing a double of herself and her lost child?“She looks like her,” says the bereaved mother, matter-of-factly. Such grace in bizarre circumstances will not surprise anyone who watches the ITV four-parter I Fought the Law. It shows Ming dealing first with what police believe to be Julie’s disappearance; then, after 80 days, the discovery of her body in the bathroom of a house forensic cops claimed to have carefully searched for five days. This led to the trial for murder of Billy Dunlop, who was acquitted when two juries could not reach verdicts. When the killer later confessed, he could not be tried again under the 800-year-old “double jeopardy” rule against being tried twice for the same crime. The main focus of the series is Ming’s campaign tooverturn that rule. She did so in 2006 – after 17 years.View image in fullscreenSheridan Smith in I Fought The Law.Photograph: Jay Brooks/ITV“I didn’t slag off police or judges or the government,” says Ming from an on-set trailer labelled “Real Ann”. “I just took it step by step, writing letters. I slept badly because of flashbacks and nightmares and so on. So my husband Charlie would find me in the middle of the night writing to another politician. I thought: ‘I’ve got the biggest mouth. I’m going to carry on.’”Did Ming find that the state relied on her eventually giving up? Much like another case of individuals fighting officialdom that was dramatised by ITV inMr Bates vs the Post Office? “Yes.” So was it stubbornness that kept her going? “No. I think it’s the injustice of it. When I look back, in the 70s, my mam had an argument with the council over her house and I wrote a letter to the secretary of state! And got a reply. So it must always have been in there somewhere. That was my first project.”Her latest is to prevent “him”, Dunlop – like many relatives of murder victims, she refuses to speak the killer’s name – being released on parole or transferred to an open prison: “I know he’ll probablyget out eventuallyand then I’ll have to deal with that. Hopefully it won’t be in my lifetime.”The series is adapted from Ming’s book, For the Love of Julie: “People said for years: ‘Why don’t you write a book?’ and I’d say: ‘It hasn’t got an ending.’ Once he was convicted, I was able to write it and it was cathartic. A ghost writer did the book for me [based on interviews] and I remember getting to the end of the transcript and thinking: ‘Wow, you got through all that and came out the other end.’”The “Real Ann” has a trailer because she is not only the subject of the story but, today, an actor.The scene at the community hall features a line-dancing class, Ming’s distracting pastime, and she cameos as one of the dancers: “I never did it before Julie. And then a friend of mine said: ‘Come on, you need to get out,’ so I started it. When Charlie got Parkinson’s, I couldn’t go for six years. For me it’s two and a half hours when you can’t concentrate on anything except the steps. So I now go five times a week. I wish Julie could have gone because she loved dancing.”During pre-production, she met Smith several times. Real people who have been portrayed on screen have told me they felt the actor studying them to steal gestures and inflections. Did Ming feel Smith doing that? “No! Was she doing that? I gelled to her straight away. I’d seen everything she’d done except for one, which they gave me. That was where Alison Steadman was her mother and she had to care for her after she’d had a stroke [Care, BBC One, 2018]. I had to do that for my husband and watching her was like watching me!”View image in fullscreenA real character  … Smith with Ann Ming.Photograph: Anastasia Arsentyeva/ITVAn audience enthralled by Ann’s agony at not being able to bring her daughter’s killer to justice despite his admission of guilt may wonder why the rule was held sacrosanct for eight centuries. “It’s a good question,” says screenwriter Jamie Crichton. “I spent a lot of time trying to find the most concise explanation of why ‘double jeopardy’ was a good idea. The best anyone offered was that it encouraged police to build the best case possible. If they thought they could keep coming back, they might be sloppy. They still have it in America, Australia, Canada and many other countries.”Having changed the law in the UK, Ming is looking beyond: “This programme – what I’d love is to send a copy to Donald Trump and say: ‘Please be brave – change the double jeopardy law all over America. Why are they frightened? People say it would mean everyone getting a retrial. But there are so many safeguards in the English law. It has to be ‘new and compelling’ evidence. When I was campaigning, someone at the Law Commission said it would only ever apply once in a blue moon. I said: ‘What if that blue moon was your son or your daughter?’”Usually, actors give interviews on set visits when they are not needed for shooting. Smith can’t today as she is in almost every scene. So it is almost a year later that I speak to the actor at the launch of the series. She apologises for “only being able to say hello” during filming but she has no need to be sorry: not only was there the volume of scenes, but almost every moment in the four hours is emotionally fraught. The director, Erik Richter Strand, told her he was amazed by how easily she seemed to find the necessary emotion. Is it simple?“Erik thinks it was,” says Smith. “Because he would say: ‘Now cry!’, ‘Now scream!’ And he got so used to me crying so much that I think he thought it was like a tap. But actually there’s a struggle underneath to get it.” At drama school, aren’t actors taught to be “in the moment”? “Yeah. But I didn’t go to drama school. So I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m blagging it. Really I just try to recreate the trauma the character would have gone through. I could never say: ‘Give me a tear stick and I’ll pretend to cry.’ I have to feel it.”Ming is the latest of several real-life people Smith has played, following Cilla Black inCilla; Charmian Biggs (wife of Great Train Robber Ronnie) inMrs Biggs; Sarah Sak, mother of a murder victim inFour Lives; Julie Bushby, searching for missing schoolgirl Shannon Matthews inThe Moorside; and cancer patient Lisa Lynch inThe C Word. Are these biographical roles policy or just what she is offered?View image in fullscreenFighting for it … Smith with Daniel York Loh as Charlie Ming in I Fought The Law.Photograph: Anastasia Arsentyeva/ITV“Not just professional offers. Lisa Lynch contacted me on Twitter and asked me to play her. I wasn’t conscious of it happening. But I think the time I can really act is when it’s someone’s pain. Whether it’s my pain coming out through the acting I don’t know. But I find doing the make-believe stuff much harder. With Mrs Biggs, I’d remember the night my brother died and my mum screaming so I’d tap into that. Now, as a mum, I imagine what if something happened to your child. So I was relieved to finish the job and get home to my son. But also aware that Ann doesn’t get to go home to her daughter. So the least I could do was go through those nine weeks’ torture. Although I don’t want to sound like a wanky actor. It is just acting, but at the same time I find playing a real person gives me purpose. I love doing comedy and make-believe but there’s something about playing a real person’s story.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And I didn’t realise Ann was watching – I don’t think I could have done it if I had known – until she walked on set and said: ‘It was like you’re in my body.’ And we were both bawling our eyes out. That was the reassurance I needed.”Their relationship, though, was not a complete love-in: “That day you were on set, she saw me smoking and said: ‘Get that cigarette out of your hand,’ and she told me I had too many tattoos.”I have been watching Smith’s work and interviewing her about it for two decades now and have often been alarmed by what these extraordinary emotional performances seem to take out of her. Is there a cost? “Yeah, there is. I think in the past I’ve used acting as therapy. I’m comfortable with this because I know you. But at the photocall today I was shaking. Ann couldn’t believe it. But, having moved up north with my little boy, suddenly coming back to London and having photographers shouting ‘This way, this way’, it’s overwhelming.“Obviously I used to drink and find my way through it that way – but now that I’ve found therapy, got my little boy, I’m sober, doing yoga and meditation, I’m a totally different person. I Fought the Law took it out of me and I’ll be mindful of what jobs I take in the future because I’m in the best place I’ve been. I have to always remember that the real-life characters have actually gone through this but I think a little bit of each character stays in me.”View image in fullscreenSmith as Myrtle in Opening Night.Photograph: Oliver Rosser/Feast CreativeLast year, in the playOpening Nightin London’s West End, she seemed, perhaps riskily, to be putting herself into the character of an actor struggling through a production while drunk, as had seemed to be the case with Smith in the musicalFunny Girlin 2015. Watching a scene in which Smith’s Opening Night character crawls around outside the theatre, I wonder if it was sensible to be doing this to herself?“I know! People offer these jobs and I’m still like the little girl from up north who thinks she’ll never work again.” But you were playing a version of? “Myself! I’ve never been that drunk on stage but, when she’s crawling across the pavement to the theatre, it definitely reflected Funny Girl and having the curtain brought down on me and all that. Doing the part was a way of facing my fears and coming to terms with it. I felt that if I could do that, I could do anything.”Even so, playing Ming has been “the hardest job I have done” and she plans to be more wary of roles that are an empathy decathlon: “I was always going back and forth between drinking and sobriety. But this time I feel it’s for real. I am, though, going to choose my parts very carefully. Sobriety and my son come first, so anything that might knock me off kilter I would be careful of. I go home and look into my little boy’s face and hope that one day he’ll be proud I did these things. With I Fought the Law, he just said: ‘Yukky wig.’ That was his review. Minus five stars. He just kept looking at the photo and laughing.”Smith has just completed The Cage, a lighter and wholly fictional BBC robbery drama but admits she is “ready to do comedy”. In an era of many TV remakes and reboots, some will wonder about the sitcom Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps,in which she appeared with Ralf Little, Natalie Casey, Will Mellor and Kathryn Drysdale in the first decade of this century.“I’d love to do that,” says Smith. “Especially after seeingGavin & Stacey, where they all came back together. I think Two Pints was like our uni for people who didn’t do uni. It would be a reunion with all your pals. I’d do it again in a heartbeat if everyone wanted to.”I Fought the Law is on ITV1 and ITVX on 31 August.Explore more on these topicsSheridan SmithDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But And Just Like That insulted their intelligence, obscured them with poorly written newbies, left them with far too little to do – and now they’re goneRebecca NicholsonFri 15 Aug 2025 09.56 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 14.52 EDTShareAfter 27 years, some of TV’s most beloved characters have left our screens for ever. Throughout Sex and the City, Carrie Bradshaw chronicled her loves, infatuations, affairs, heartbreaks, friendships, high fashion, homes, work and more, all over a cosmopolitan or five. Throughout what would turn out to be the final season of its spin-off,And Just Like That, she finally ended her extremely on/off 20-year-relationship with country boy Aidan, a man revived for the series with a cruel streak and all the subtlety of Elmer Fudd, and slowly bought furniture for her enormous mansion.In many ways, the entire series was an inglorious swansong. And Just Like That first appeared in 2021, and devotees of the original might have held a tentative flicker of hope that in returning to these beloved characters, now in their 50s, it might find a way to repurpose some of its former magic for this new stage of life. It began with a splash by killing off Carrie’s husband, Mr Big, who had a heart attack while overdoing it on his stationary exercise bike.Some felt that such a casual death was disrespectful to the show’s history – something that would become a running theme – but it did, at least, suggest that the show was not going to hold back, or tiptoe around its past and legacy.View image in fullscreenSex and the City original Charlotte was joined by new characters such as Lisa for the spin-off series.Photograph: HBOUnfortunately, it went in the other direction, careering all over that legacy like a toddler just learning to walk. There would be no Samantha, of course:Kim Cattrall, who played her, has long been open about her poor relationship with her former cast mates and her lack of interest in returning to the show.And Just Like That tried to plug the Samantha gap with new friends, finding Samantha’s ambition in a documentary-maker, Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker), and her sex drive in real estate agent Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury), though both mostly felt like superfluous distractions from the core characters.Cattrall did return as Samantha for 71 seconds, during the season two finale, but only to phone Sarah Jessica Parker’s Carrie to let her know that she wouldn’t make it to the party, after all. The scene was delicious, camp and regal, but a stark reminder of how much the character was missed.From its earliest days, And Just Like That became synonymous with hate-watching. This reached its peak with Miranda’s divorce from Steve and affair with Che Diaz, a non-binary standup comedian, who turned into one of the internet’sfavourite least-favourite characters. Che was poorly written, sure, but they were indicative of the show’s haphazard handling of ageing. It largely examined getting older by placing characters in a state of bewilderment at how much the world had changed since the early 00s, which felt shallow and unflattering to their intelligence. They would be confused by podcasts, or restaurants with digital menus. The wit and acidic humour of Sex and the City allowed it to ask big questions, not all of which have aged well, but in And Just Like That, there was simply an admission that nobody really knew what was going on any more.View image in fullscreenGoodbye Carrie: the character in And Just Like That’s finale.Photograph: HBOAll of its worst tendencies came out inthe finale. Oddly, it mostly ended up being about Charlotte’s friend Mark, Brady, the mother of Brady’s unborn child and her confusingly obnoxious young genderqueer friends (let it go!). It was a shrug of a plotline that washed its hands of everything that made the characters what they once were, by deciding not to make it about the characters at all.Through much of the last season, there was a sense that Carrie has nothing to do but wander around in couture, aimlessly, too rich to have any ambitions left, other than a now vague notion of romantic love. It is not a tragedy that she waved farewell to the land ofSex and the Cityas a single woman, but it is not as poignant as the writers seem to believe it is, either. It’s nothing-ey, an ambient inbetween, a very And Just Like That-esque, “will this do?”. After a particularly hideous blocked-toilet episode, Carrie said the punchline that the whole scene was written to deliver: “Shit happens.” It was a muted note on which to bow out.They knew the end was coming, that much is clear. At the start of August, in the statement announcing that it would be ending for good, showrunner Michael Patrick King said that when writing the last episode, “it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop”.Wonderful might have been pushing it. It has been a curious four years, full of superfluous nonsense, not unpleasant, but not a patch on its TV ancestor. That blocked toilet, overflowing, was doing some heavy lifting when it came to the metaphor. It is hard to argue that And Just Like That should have gone on, when it became so evident that it had nowhere to go.Explore more on these topicsAnd Just Like ThatTelevisionSex and the CitySarah Jessica ParkerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hull …” Chiedu Oraka grins, pointing his mic towards the middle of a near-empty recording studio. Silence – for now, at least. Next week, that pause will be filled by 20,000 voices at Craven Park stadium, where the local rapper will openColdplay’s latest UK run of Music of the Spheres tour dates. And he is determined to make that crowd his own. “There’s going to be people there who haven’t seen me before, so I want to give them everything – new songs, old ones and a party,” he says. “I’m proper buzzing for it.”Last year, Oraka played Glastonbury, opened for Skepta at South by Southwest and supported the Brit-award-winning rapper Casisdead. But theseColdplayshows are the 37-year-old’s biggest gigs yet – and Hull’s most high-profile music events in years. The gigs reflect Coldplay’s effort to reach working-class areas, while 10% of the proceeds from ticket sales will go to the Music Venue Trust, which protects grassroots venues. Chris Martin enlisting Oraka fulfils part of that ethos to uplift communities.View image in fullscreen‘Proper buzzing’ … Chiedu Oraka performing at the Nordoff and Robbins Northern Music awards in Liverpool this year.Photograph: Richard Martin-Roberts/Getty Images“Chris FaceTimed me from his studio in LA and said: ‘I’m coming to your city. How can I help you?’” says Oraka. We are speaking at Yankee Land, aHullfast food spot renowned for its chips. Oraka is a family friend who has been anointed with his own box meal: a giant burger with turkey bacon, fries, chilli cheese bites and popcorn chicken. Today, however, he has opted for a chicken burger, strips and a chocolate milkshake.“I was just brazen with it,” he continues. “Like: ‘Mate, I wanna support you on both shows.’” They announced the newson social mediawith a staged video call, in which Martin repeatedly butchered the pronunciation of Chiedu, before conceding that Coldplay would be, Oraka says, “closing the show for me”. The line was Martin’s idea; the mispronunciation gag came from earlier conversations, when the frontman struggled with his name.Over email, Martin keeps up the shtick: “I discovered Chiedu while learning about the music scene in Hull, and after we spoke a bit I asked him if he’d be open to us closing for him there. He took his time, but eventually agreed, as long as we don’t look him in the eye.”In Yankee Land, at least, the 6ft 7in (2-metre) star wears his homegrown celebrity status with warm humility. Staff repeatedly offer to replenish our spread of food. “Hey, Chie!” is followed by promises to text meet-up plans. “Everyone’s my best mate now,” he laughs, recalling the frenzy that followed the Coldplay news. “Like: ‘Oh, Iknewhe was always going to do it!’”Oraka was born and raised by a single mother on a council estate in north Hull and his identity is at the core of his artistry. They were the only Black family in the area; he grew up surrounded by white classmates who didn’t understand his Nigerian heritage. Racism was so entrenched that some of his friends hid from their parents the fact they were hanging out with a Black kid.‘A funny accent draws bare attention’: how regional rappers stormed the chartsRead more“We were eating pounded yam and when my friends came over they were weirded out by it,” he says. “I was embarrassed. I just wanted to fit in.” He soon started getting into trouble. By 10, he was arrested for shoplifting; in 2007, he went to prison for fighting. “I’ve gone through the system of crime, I’ve sold drugs – the stereotypical ‘Black thing’ to do.” Now, through music, Oraka wants to tell a different story.Sonically, the rapper is indebted to London, switching with ease between grime, garage and UK funky. But on his debut mixtape, 2024’s Misfit, Oraka raps about mental health and race through the lens of a working-class northerner. On Own Kind, he is candid about feeling like an outsider in mainstream Black spaces: “At home, I’m way too Black / When I leave it’s not the same.” On No Need, he voices his mum’s fear of him ending up like Christopher Alder, a Black man whodied in police custody in Hull in 1998. “I’m trying to northernise the Black experience, because it’s more than just inner-city London,” he says.Oraka says he has encountered hostility in the London-centric music industry, from comments about his accent to a lack of interest from Black music outlets. “I really wanted to be accepted in the GRM Daily, Link Up TV, Mixtape Madness world – you know, the main Black media. And I just wasn’t getting no love,” he says. “When a Black guy raps about drugs and jail, it unfortunately sells, because that’s the language people understand. But there are stories to be told from kids who grew up like me. I just want a level playing field.”Oraka has since learned to embrace his difference as a “superpower” – hence his slogan “The Black Yorkshireman”, which today is emblazoned on the back of his T-shirt. A new EP, Undeniable, will drop in October, accompanied by a UK tour that kicks off at the New Adelphi Club in Hull, a tiny venue that has hosted Oasis and fellow local success story the Housemartins.View image in fullscreenBehind the scenes … Oraka and the producer and hype man Deezkid in rehearsal.Photograph: James WhincupHis new music, he says, is “going to show the listener that I mean business. I’m coming for the title of king of the north.” He catches himself to avoid disrespecting the incumbent royal. “I’m not trying to slate Bugzy Malone – I think he’s unreal. What he’s done for northern rappers is mad. He created the blueprint.”Diversity in Hull has improved significantly since Oraka’s childhood. But afterlast summer’s riotsand the election of a Reform mayor in East Yorkshire this spring, Oraka acknowledges that there is still work to be done. “That was embarrassing,” he says, of last year’s violence. “That’s not a true reflection of Hull at all. It’s just a very small minority. The recent election was terrible – unfortunately, a lot of these people are sheep. They don’t do their own research and follow the bandwagon. It’s very toxic.”The weight of this moment is not lost on Oraka and he is prepared for the pressure that comes with increased visibility. “This is an opportunity for young Black kids from Hull to see me supporting the biggest band in the world. Like: if he can do it, there’s hope for us,” he says, beaming. “I feel that responsibility and I’m relishing it. I was born to do this.”Undeniable is released via Republic of Music on 31 October.

Here, the team that made the shooter reflect on how it all happenedThomas HobbsFri 15 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 04.01 EDTShareThe rapper50 Cent(real name Curtis Jackson) was inescapable back in 2005. There wasn’t a British classroom without a teenager wearing Jackson’s G-Unit clothing, while his catchy hits Candy Shop and In Da Club dominated the radio. The backstory of this Queens-born New Yorker – how he survived being shot nine times only to become one of the world’s biggest rappers – also made for compelling lore.That year, 50 Cent sold more than a million copies in one week with his sophomore studio album, The Massacre. In a bid to cash in on this superstardom, his label Interscope Records planned a twin strategy: a Hollywood biopic (Get Rich or Die Tryin’) and a licensed video game, 50 Cent: Bulletproof – both to be released by November 2005. “I think the general public are going to be blown away by my game,” 50 Cent told the website IGN. “It feels more like an action film.”British developer GenuineGames, previously responsible for a poorly received Fight Club tie-in, was tasked with creating Fiddy’s 128-bit era adventure. The problem was it only had 11 months to do it. “I remember we’d get to the office at 7am and wouldn’t leave until about 11pm,” recalls the game’s artist Han Randhawa. “We all lived on a diet of KFC. 50 Cent became my whole life. I even read up the doctor’s report from when he got shot, just so I could put bandages on his 3D character in the right places.”The game’s designer, Haydn Dalton, says: “It’s funny, because this was a game about these dudes from the hood, and yet here was this white guy from the north-west of England writing all their in-game dialogue. It was kind of awkward, but I didn’t have much time, so it was about making stuff up on the fly.”View image in fullscreenShoot first, questions later …Photograph: THQTime has been surprisingly kind to50 Cent: Bulletproof, which is 20 this November. In this shooter, 50 Cent gets caught up in a shadowy underground network full of dodgy terrorists, racist biker gangs and mouthy mafia members. Looking to track down whoever riddled him with those nine bullet wounds, 50 and his G-Unit gang (including Tony Yayo, Young Buck and Lloyd Banks) race through inner city environments, shooting first and asking questions later.It’s as if G-Unit has been modelled on the A-Team, with each member bringing something unique (Yayo is an explosives expert; Banks picks locks), while the game also has surprisingly intuitive cover mechanics, whereby your squad ducks behind walls during shootouts. With its screenplay written by the Sopranos’ writer Terence Winter, the cinematic cut-scenes involving 50 Cent conversing with corrupt Det McVicar are a particular thrill.Power player: how 50 Cent went from rapper to unlikely TV kingpinRead moreHe is a dirty cop voiced by a madcap Eminem, who constantly demands more extortion money so he can send his kid to expensive karate classes. The White rapper’s McVicar is joined by Dr Dre, who voices a stoned arms dealer who says things like “That’s some serious shit right there”, whenever 50 Cent purchases a rocket launcher. The game is stacked full of licensed 50 Cent songs, too, meaning you can kick a heavy in the face while Wanksta plays in the background.“We were really blessed, because 50 Cent felt more like a superhero than just a rapper,” explains the game’s director David Broadhurst. “The idea was to make him a Black James Bond.” Yet Broadhurst admits the British development team missed out on a lot of this production’s glitz and glamour. “Vivendi [the game’s publisher] kept us away from 50 Cent and G-Unit; we’d get sent all their audio. I remember 50 Cent had invested in Vitamin Water, so we had to put the drink into the game as a purchasable item.”View image in fullscreenConcept art for 50 Cent: Bulletproof.Photograph: Vivendi Universal GamesSpecific requests are something Randhawa also remembers. He says that G-Unit member Tony Yayo wanted constant revisions made to his character’s face. “I knew I’d done a good job on Yayo,” laughs Randhawa. “When we wrapped one of the executive producers came over to me and was like: ‘The other members of G-Unit say you absolutely nailed Yayo’s ugliness!’”According to Dalton, the original idea was for 50 Cent: Bulletproof to be more of an open world game akin to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. An early build allowed 50 to jump on the subway to navigate the Big Apple, but strict deadlines meant the development team settled for a more straightforward experience. Dalton reveals: “One idea was that 50 managed all these hookers in the street and they’d go out and collect drug money for him. 50 could control these women through a mobile phone and a special Pimp Management System (PMS). I know people might cringe at this feature today, but Bulletproof was a product of its time.”Whereas other rap video games, such as those in the Def Jam fighting series, had violently pinned emcees against one another, Bulletproof refreshingly depicted rappers as the heroes. “It was a nice to have a piece of art where the rapper was the outright hero rather than the antihero,” explains former G-Unit Records’ executive producer Sha Money XL.View image in fullscreen‘If you shot at G-Unit in 2005 then we were gonna shoot back’ …Photograph: Vivendi Universal GamesMoney XL helmed the 50 Cent: Bulletproof soundtrack and he admits the game’s title could easily have been seen by the rapper’s many enemies as a call to violence. “Maybe some people wanted to test if 50 really was bulletproof, but if anyone was going to shoot at G-Unit in 2005 then we were gonna shoot back. Back then, 50 was the kind of person you either loved or you hated.”This divisiveness might explain why 50 Cent: Bulletproof was savaged by critics. The game only has a 52% score on Metacritic, with reviewers criticising the game’s clunky aiming. The game’s director believes there was a clear agenda against the production from the off.“It was obvious a lot of the reviewers hadn’t even played Bulletproof,” Broadhurst says. “Maybe they didn’t like licensed games or a Black lead character who sold drugs. I don’t know, but a lot of people were picking it up expecting something bad and coming away feeling surprised when it turned out to be pretty good.”There were scrapped plans for a direct Bulletproof sequel, where the focus was on urban warfare and G-Unit surviving amid an America caught up in a civil war. However, 50 Cent: Bulletproof did inspire an underrated 2009 sequel via the Swordfish Studios-developed50 Cent: Blood in the Sand, where Fiddy bizarrely fights the war on terror throughout the Middle East, pissed off after having a crystal skull stolen by terrorists.Furious, funny and potentially fatal: hip-hop’s 20 greatest diss tracks – ranked!Read moreThese two 50 Cent titles weren’t a trigger for more hip-hop video games. Dalton has a theory as to why: “50 Cent was the last truly global mainstream rap superstar. There’s been a vacuum since. Even though our game made a lot of money, a new rapper game just isn’t obvious.”Owing to the complex licensing agreements in place, it’s unlikely there will be a remaster of 50 Cent: Bulletproof any time soon. But for those who want a time machine back to 2005, tracking down a copy of the original on eBay is essential.As Dalton puts it: “Yes our game was rushed, but I don’t have any regrets. When you go on Reddit you see a lot of people nostalgic for what we created. I’m not so sure a Drake game would hit the same way as he’s too soft by comparison. There aren’t many rappers right for a video game, but 50 Cent was 100% one of them.”Explore more on these topicsGames50 CentRetro gamesRapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Over 75 minutes, using six puppeteers, two percussionists and a choir of 12 – the excellent Ars Nova Copenhagen – they aim to create the world before our very eyes before nearly destroying it, twice. And all by manipulating some lanterns, a few swathes of silk and a handful of fragments reminiscent of flotsam. The action is measured, the sound world haunting, and the visuals, nimbly lit by Ayumu “Poe” Saegusa, are effective, but it does take a while to get going.Ruo, who was born in China and lives in the US, writes assured, distinctive music, fusing east and west in a way that feels natural and authentic. Here, he deploys an array of tuned and untuned percussion instruments, some of them used in traditional Chinese orchestras, but most familiar to western ears. Gongs, finger cymbals, marimba and Tibetan singing bowls put in appearances, yet all are used sparingly. Vocally, too, there’s a certain austerity, whether in sober chant or rhythmic chatter. Melismatic melodies and ululating choruses lend cross-cultural spice to Ruo’s musical melting pot.The work tells four tales drawn from Chinese myths transcribed in the fourth century BC. Judiciously chosen, their contemporary resonances range from the climate crisis to the boundless hubris of humankind. In the first, the death of the hairy titan Pan Gu creates sun and moon, mountains and rivers, and finally humans. The second tells of a drowned princess reborn as a vengeful bird. The third relates how 10 over-enthusiastic suns are whittled down to one to prevent them burning up the planet, and the fourth how the dim-witted giant Kua Fu tries and fails to capture the sun that remains.View image in fullscreenPuppet masters … Book of Mountains and Seas.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianThe choir, robed like monks and with only their faces illuminated, tackle the intricate lines with confidence and a sure sense of pitch, singing in a combination of Mandarin and an unfathomable made-up language. The former appears now and again as surtitles, the latter does not. It is left to Twist and his puppeteers to tell us what is going on, which on the whole they do with craft and clarity. The imagery for tales one and two is a trifle plain: the story of the embittered bird and the ocean is told with little more than a crimson-fringed kite and a rippling white sheet.The propulsive fourth story, however, where the deconstructed fragments come together to create the sun-hunting giant, is visually arresting. But it’s the stately progression of the 10 lanterns in the third tale, where graceful movement echoes music of piercing beauty, that lingers longest.At theLyceum, Edinburgh, until 16 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Classical musicOperaPuppetryTheatreEdinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

In one-to-one encounters such as The Smile Off Your Face and Internal, they have put the spectator at the heart of their own drama, often to discombobulating effect. In the hall of mirrors of A Game of You, Alexander Devriendt’s company made you the unwitting star of someone else’s play, and inAudience, it tested the limits of what you deemed acceptable on stage.Earnest commentators have fretted over the ethics of all this (me, I love the head-spinning thrill of it all), but even though Thanks for Being Here might raise similar questions about privacy and consent, it is done in such a spirit of communal joy, you would have to be unusually sensitive to object. Funny, accepting and warm-hearted, this celebration of the shared experience is the perfect festival show.The joke, which becomes apparent only as the performance progresses, is that everything we are watching has been generated by the audience: either those of us here today or those who have seen it previously. As with Internal, which was a mix of speed-dating and group therapy, no performance is ever the same, being determined by the participants, even as the underlying structure is solid.My audience played their parts consummately, instinctively understanding the rules of entering the auditorium, finding a seat, getting comfortable, puzzling over the performance, wondering if it could be improved and, no doubt, discussing it in the bar afterwards. It would be normal to credit the performers, Karolien De Bleser, Charlotte De Bruyne, Patricia Kargbo and Leonore Spee – and they do indeed bring a deliciously deadpan observational wit – but the real accolades go to all of us for being the show we demanded and for doing it so unselfconsciously.

What elevatesMiles., a tribute to jazz legend Miles Davis, is the role of musicianJay Phelps. Not only does he give a credible imitation of Davis’s spare trumpet style, he also plays along convincingly to backing tapes ofKind of Blue, regarded by many as the definitive jazz album.Phelps is more than an incidental player. A constant presence in a production written and directed by Oliver Kaderbhai, Phelps plays a Davis acolyte trying to learn from the master, while the pressure of a record company advance looms over him.What was the secret ingredient, he wants to know, that turned Kind of Blue into a bestselling jazz album? How much did it depend on the collaborators, including John Coltrane and Bill Evans? Where did it fit into the musician’s history of drug abuse and womanising? Now aged 32, the same as Davis at the recording in 1959, could he ever hope to achieve as much?Answering some of these questions – and evading others – is Benjamin Akintuyosi in the title role. With a raspy post-op voice gurgling up from deep in his throat, he plays Davis as sharp, forthright, hard to impress but passionate in his enthusiasms. His is a tale of musical obsession offset by a lack of money; creative innovation offset by racial prejudice.With his influences stretching to Stravinsky, Prokofiev and Debussy, as well as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and the street rhythms of Afro-Irish tap dance, Davis’s musicality is more deeply felt than his Juilliard education might suggest. Kind of Blue, he says in the play, is “my pain on a 78”, an experiment he thought had failed.With projections by Colin J Smith adding to the period detail, the show is a fact-packed, reverent and loving testament to the complicated man behind a musical benchmark.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalMiles DavisJazzreviewsShareReuse this content"

Rubbery, bulbous things, they look as if they would leave a trail of slime if they touched you. And they probably want to touch you. They belong to Martin, aka Mr Creep, the alter ego of Theodora van der Beek, all lank hair, faux leather jacket and grubby 70s aesthetic.To call Martin a character would be stretching a point: he does not actually do very much in this entertaining show, half lecture, half film screening. He is more object than protagonist. He is a symbol of every office pest, every man who gets uncomfortably close on public transport, every bloke with a warped sense of his sexual attractiveness to younger women. He eats a lot of ham.I See You Watching review – the male gaze in full effectRead moreThe show is a product of lockdown when the performer and her six-strong household decided to throw an office party at home, seeing as none of them had an office of their own. They took on roles from intern to boss and Van der Beek came as the office creep. Getting to know the enemy, she found Martin, with his perfumed breath and poor spatial awareness, strangely compelling. What if she could look at the world through his eyes?Swiping Right review – punchy questions about dating across the political divideRead moreNow, reading from cue cards, she takes us through a series of movies, AI-generated fantasies and TV clips to talk about the objectifying lens of the male gaze and men’s almost imperceptible encroachments on female space (elsewhere in Edinburgh,Red Like Fruithas a similar theme).Some sections are more fully realised than others in a show Van der Beek admits is developing all the time, but she has inventiveness and eccentric charm to carry her through, not to mention a particularly disgusting way with processed meat. The show’s tone is quirky, messy and wry, even while its message is on point.AtBanshee Labyrinth, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalSexual harassmentreviewsShareReuse this content"

Certified pedophiles.” The artwork for the global hit single features an image of Drake’s home dotted with icons used to identify the homes of registered sex offenders.Drake has denied the allegations, and in January filed a lawsuit against UMG – not Lamar himself – alleging that it “approved, published and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track” that was “intended to convey the specific, unmistakable and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response”.The label initially responded that the suit was “utterly without merit”.View image in fullscreenLucian Grainge said that he never heard the song prior to its release.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesDrake’s latest motion argued that Drake believes “Grainge was personally involved in decisions made regarding the marketing and promotion of [Not Like Us] around its release”.Lawyers for UMG have now called for Drake’s motion to be denied, labelling it a “transparent attempt to use discovery to harass UMG and force it to waste time and resources out of spite” and that his “attempts to show Sir Lucian’s relevance are so strained that they defy credulity”.In legal documents, Grainge declared that he never heard the song prior to its release.Lawyer Rollin A Ransom continued: “The premise of Drake’s motion – that he could not have lost a rap battle unless it was the product of some imagined secret conspiracy going to the top of UMG’s corporate structure – is absurd. Sir Lucian is the CEO of a multinational enterprise; his days are spent determining and implementing global strategy, not vetting individual tracks or album covers or driving the release and promotional plans for any one recording.”Drake previously agreed not to seek documents from Grainge, the letter states. “And even if Sir Lucian had any responsive documents, they would surely be captured by discovery from UMG’s other document custodians, who were actually responsible for releasing and promoting Not Like Us. Drake does not come close to meeting his burden of showing that Sir Lucian must be a custodian.”The letter concludes: “Drake argues that Sir Lucian must be a custodian for no other reason than because Drake asked for him. That is entirely inconsistent with the law and is particularly inappropriate given that Drake’s request is clearly based on a desire to harass UMG, rather than for a legitimate reason.”Drake has not responded to the new filing. The Guardian has contacted his representatives.UMG is seeking to have the case dismissed entirely,claiming in Marchthat Drake “lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated … diss tracks are a popular and celebrated art form centred around outrageous insults, and they would be severely chilled if Drake’s suit were permitted to proceed”.Explore more on these topicsDrakeKendrick LamarUniversal MusicnewsShareReuse this content"

Contestants who have abuse screamed in their face. Cash prizes. This documentary about a horrific 00s weight-loss reality TV series in the US makes for deeply troubling watchingPhil HarrisonFri 15 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 15 Aug 2025 08.49 EDTShareThe mid-2000s were a peculiar time in television. After the dubious 90s innovations of Jerry Springer in the US were followed by the UK launch of Big Brother, it was clear that using the travails of so-called ordinary people as fuel for small-screen entertainment was an idea with legs. There was a mini goldrush of sorts as programme makers realised that conflict, extremity and dysfunction would always sell – and that any human-interest subject could be shoehorned into some version of reality TV.In Britain, ITV’s The Jeremy Kyle Show began casting its malign spell in 2005. In the US, something similarly queasy (and enduring) had arrived a year earlier in the shape of NBC’s weight loss bootcamp-meets-bearpit, The Biggest Loser, which took contestants living with obesity then belittled them with humiliating tasks such as moving food from one place to another using only their teeth. It deployed fitness coaches to scream abuse in their faces, and weighed them in front of a studio audience. For the series winner, there was, in addition to a newly slimline body, a large cash prize.The first former contestant we meet in this three-part documentary about the show is season eight winner Danny Cahill. Danny does not look like someone who has lost large amounts of weight. This is an intimation of trouble ahead. Could it be that losing weight over a recklessly short period of time is not a sustainable way of combating obesity? Might it even be dangerous? Quite possibly. We’re told that a high percentage of former contestants who later took part in a New York Times study put much of their weight back on after the show. And the study suggested the programme’s hothouse methods caused people’s metabolisms to slow, making them less able to process food quickly.How about aftercare? The Biggest Loser simply didn’t bother with it, as the producers openly admit. In the context of the stories in Fit for TV, that feels unforgivable. For season one winner Ryan Benson, weight loss quickly became a means to an end. “I lost all focus on getting healthy,” he says. “It was about winning.” Shortly after the final episode, blood was found in his urine. It was around that time that he was congratulated (after a fashion) by one of the show’s two fitness trainers, the permanently snarling Jillian Michaels. “Ryan, you just made me a millionaire,” she apparently said.Michaels declined to be interviewed for this series, which is a shame from a journalistic point of view but a relief in every other way. The show’s other gym beast, Bob Harper, does front up. He is fairly forthright in his defence of the show, claiming that many people were helped – although his habit of lifting his small dog on to his lap when difficult subjects arise feels revealing. He also manages, in four throwaway words, to make a watertight case against the show. “Everyone knows it’s diet,” he says, when discussing sustainable weight loss strategies. What offhand disdain for viewers and participants is contained in that short sentence. Everyone here is being taken for a mug. Because when it comes to the creation of TV, what use is a diet? Watching peoplenoteating doughnuts and burgers is no fun. Can’t we push them until they vomit instead?Chainsaws, shame and lifelong damage: inside TV’s horrific relationship with plus-size peopleRead moreThe author and podcaster Aubrey Gordon, who has written and spoken extensively about weight-related issues, pinpoints the crucial problem.The Biggest Loser wanted to have its calorific cake and eat it. It encouraged participants to trust the process and then misled them at every turn. “The show was trying to do deep emotional work,” she says. “But it didn’t want to have people who were credentialed to do it.” And so, she suggests that the trainers became pseudo-therapists as well as drill sergeants. They were both carrot and stick. Ultimately, the documentary claims that they simply couldn’t be trusted, as evinced in their giving contestants caffeine pills to stimulate energy and suppress appetite, even as the programme’s resident medic was telling them not to drink coffee.Perhaps fittingly, this documentary feels somewhat frantic in places – it’s as jittery and frenetic as a caffeine-fuelled workout. It would probably have benefited from fewer voices, a little more analysis and a clearer narrative through-line. However, the stories it tells are powerful enough to stick in the memory, as warnings from recent history. As the age of truly nasty reality TV passes (for now), documentaries about these kinds of shows are starting to feel like their own microgenre, with their own tropes. As with earlier series about Jerry Springer (on Netflix) and Jeremy Kyle (on Channel 4), there is a limited, grudging mea culpa or two. There is also plenty of buck-passing. There are obvious villains and equally obvious victims. And somewhere at the back of it all is a sense that, even at this point, it’s all in the game. For now, TV’s appetite for extremity has taken a back seat to its willingness to acknowledge duty of care. This may not always be the case.Fit for TV: The Reality of the Biggest Loser is on Netflix.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewReality TVDocumentaryObesityFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Pine, Evans, Pratt, Hemsworth. And they all looked the same, especially Pratt ‘n’ Evans and Pine ‘n’ Hemsworth (plus Hemsworth had 17 brothers who also looked the same, which felt like an unnecessary layer of complication). Then Evans became Captain America and Hemsworth became Thor and that sorted things out a tad, although Pratt ran interference as Star-Lord in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise for a bit.Anyway. Limitless is a reality-documentary sort of thing by the Hemsworth one (if you need further elucidation, he is Australian and looks like a handsome teddy bear with an unparalleled fitness regime). In the first series he investigated ways to deal with stress and shock, and how to slow the ageing process and other ills that flesh is heir to. In the fifth episode, he found out he had two copies of theheritable gene for Alzheimer’s disease, making him eight to 10 times more likely than the average person to get it. This added an unexpected note of gritty realism to proceedings and seemed to give our seemingly otherwise invincible hero understandable pause for thought.‘We are obsessed with weight’: Bob Harper on life as a trainer on The Biggest LoserRead moreNow he is back with a shorter second series, Limitless: Live Better Now, looking at ways to improve not just his physical resilience but mental too. The three episodes cover ways in which to reformulate his approach to the chronic back pain he has suffered since he was a teenager, whether we can benefit from facing up to the things that most scare us and, in the opening instalment, how to protect ourselves against cognitive decline.The expert consulted recommends learning a musical instrument as one of the best ways of keeping over-40-year-old neurons firing and synaptic pathways forming in a nicely plastic manner. There are also the emotional and social bonds that music can engender, she notes. “That depends,” says Hemsworth, who seems to have managed to retain to an impressive extent his antipodean dryness in the face of Hollywood excess, “how well you can play”.He can, it turns out, already get by on the guitar well enough, so he needs something more challenging. His palEd Sheeran– a charmingly low-key unperformative friendship – tries him out on a few other instruments in his studio. They opt for the drums. It is a bold choice for a man without any notable sense of rhythm. Even bolder is the goal of being able to accompany Sheeran in a rendition of his hit Thinking Out Loud as part of his stadium tour in two months’ time.View image in fullscreenCaught in a snare … Chris Hemsworth in Limitless.Photograph: National Geographic/PAHemsworth recruits another pal to teach him how to play. His fellow Australian Ben Gordon is the drummer with the heavy metal bandParkway Driveand is chosen for his personal “Zen quality”. At the end of their first lesson, Gordon remarks that it is “pretty hard to find something Chris is bad at. But I think we’ve found it.” There is a chance, he says, that the audience’s favourite song “could be severely butchered by Chris”. To be fair, he does say it serenely.Hemsworth’s lack of natural talent is soon coupled with a lack of time to rehearse amid all the other demands on his time. “Chris doesn’t really have his head around that yet,” says Gordon, serenely, of the chorus, as the weeks tick by. “He can’t just muscle his way through this,” says Gordon calmly, more weeks and less rehearsal time later.A couple of weeks before the big night, Gordon has him rehearse with his Parkway Drive bandmates. “What’s becoming clear,” Hemsworth says at the end, “is that I really can’t keep time.” “You chose the wrong instrument, mate,” says one of the band, cheerfully. “It was a trainwreck.”Somehow – and it is not my place to speculate on how this might have been achieved, perhaps with someone counting him in via earbud or frantically conducting just out of sight of the camera – it is alright on the night, and 70,000 paying customers do not have their night ruined and Hemsworth feels that the experience has future-proofed his brain in some small way. Hurrah!The same goes for the techniques he is taught by a palliative care doctor and the triple amputee BJ Miller, the MMA champion Kim Dong-hyun, a training session with South Korean special forces and a Buddhist ceremony to cope with pain, and with his experience of climbing a 600ft dam in the Swiss Alps in the name of exposure therapy and testing his hyperfocus capacities. Good for him. He’s a warmly personable presence, even if he doesn’t much endanger the truism that actors are best when they are given a script to follow. But at least now we know for sure how to pick him out of a Chris lineup in an emergency. Just show them a drum kit and see which one quails.Limitless: Live Better Now is on Disney+ nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionChris HemsworthFactual TVEd SheeranreviewsShareReuse this content"

Many of that book’s issues, including the psychic damage he incurred from events he witnessed in Indonesia, East Timor and Afghanistan in the 1990s and early 2000s, are reinflected in this, his first novel.Kit and Lara live in a remote village in the deep rainforest. She works for a small, undependably financed NGO. He’s a stay-at-home husband, living for their baby daughter Helen. While Lara presents as impulsive yet practical and barely able to contain her own energy, Kit is dreamy, internalised, exhibiting a calmness that falls easily into dissociation. “This is your life,” she shouts at him shortly before they leave the UK, “a day of your life, and it requires your presence.” He’s struggling with the local language. His wife has neglected to tell him that he’s speaking it in the female register, which is why the villagers are so amused by him. Beneath the trees, the light is “filtered to a soupy dimness”. The villagers claim to be able to tell a child’s fortune from its teeth. The baby, kept in a heavily air-conditioned pod in the space beneath their stilted house, has a rash. Her future, it seems, will feature a long journey: a prediction, Kit observes politely, that he recognises from fortune tellers in his own country.The cumulative effect is sometimes of a novel that can’t quite decide whether to be closely observant or distanced to abstractionThough there are outright tensions between husband and wife, and a sense that neither of them is entirely connected with their situation, their life maintains a fractious stability until the arrival of English journalist Court Hardy. Hardy brings them up to date on the political context of their idyll, and warns them that they’re now living in the middle of a war. Lara vanishes. After an attack on the village, Kit and his daughter are ejected into the rainforest, along with a villager called Obson, a handful of the village children, and the novel’s MacGuffin – the memory card from Hardy’s camera, which in the right hands will reveal direct superpower interference in the conflict. To say much more about the plot would be to spoil it.We are left to guess where these events occur. Lloyd Parry provides broad clues, but anyway it’s in some sense less a nation than a fabular Everywhere, with the local language known only as “the Tongue”, the country always referred to as “the Country”. The Country has been invaded by “the Neighbour”. The nation financing the war is “the Superpower” (or, as Lara formulates it, “the Confederated States of Uncle Fuckface”). Meanwhile, where Kit and Lara are an easily recognisable contemporary couple, Hardy – stout, middle-aged and blustering, his dialogue cluttered with exclamations such as “Fuckaroo” – strikes the reader as the comedy war correspondent of a previous generation. The cumulative effect is sometimes of a novel that can’t quite decide whether to be closely observant or distanced to abstraction; realistic or rawly satirical. The reader, unsure how or in what direction to suspend disbelief, looks around furtively for authorial support.After this uneasy beginning, In the Green Heart settles to its real task. The forest quickly reveals itself as a central character. Despite his familiarity with its outskirts, Kit is “unprepared for the experience of being enclosed” by it. The air feels “thick and unstirring”. “Time itself,” he muses, was “muffled and distorted”. Obson and the good-natured children pluck “dark festoons” of leeches from each other’s bodies. Kit can’t keep up with them. He feels like “a man swimming in the shallows, who suddenly finds himself above a trench of ocean miles deep”. He’s brought along a compass, but magnetic ores in the surrounding rock render it useless. “It’s OK, Mr Kristian,” Obson reassures him, “I know a way.” But soon enough Obson seems lost, too. As agents of the Superpower close in, intent on retrieving the memory card, the forest becomes the centre of Kit’s struggle against his own personality; only Helen’s few remaining plastic-packaged nappies seem more symbolic. “Crisp as wafers, the opposite of the forest with its wet and profusion, its endless ramifying life”, they console him for his lost entitlement.“The Green Heart” is a nicely ambiguous phrase, suggesting the heart of a forest, certainly; but equally a human heart under-tested by experience. Kit is lost and his core is green, too. All that connects him to his own experience is the relationship of care with his daughter, presented without distance and in constant wonder. We feel it even more powerfully than we feel his glassy, self-protective dissociation, or his furtive admiration for the forest dwellers who keep him and his daughter alive if not entirely “safe”. Helen is an “immense gamble with his own happiness”. His love for her is “helpless, without walls or will”. By the end of the nightmare – and it is a nightmare, determinedly evoked – the war and its politics, particularly in the interplay between global and national, have supplanted both meanings of the title.In a tour-de-force final dialogue between Kit and the recently deposed president of the Country, Lloyd Parry explores the foetid jungle of relationships between local power and superpower. In the Green Heart is a strange tale: a little awkward, intensely political, designed to lay bare the fictions of a contemporary colonialism yet inseparable from the closeup portrait of a man attempting to both shelter in and break out of an internal psychic trap. In short, very contemporary.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

But the actors and writers Linus Karp and Joseph Martin will be tying the knot at the Edinburgh fringe, walking down the aisle of the Pleasance Grand on Saturday. Tickets to attend are £12 a pop – and they hope to avoid getting star ratings.“It’s surprisingly affordable,” says Martin. “We’d been looking at doing it in London and that was ‘the first Tuesday of every month at 8.30am, only bookable three years in advance’. Our work is loud, queer and joyous, and this felt like a good way to represent that side of us. It’s silly and ridiculous, but it feels right.” There will be a dramatic entrance and special-guest speeches, but their vows will be real. “We wouldn’t ever do anything for attention,” deadpans Karp.It will, however, do no harm in raising the profile of their other show,The Fit Prince(Who Gets Switched on the Square in the Frosty Castle the Night Before [Insert Public Holiday Here]). The show grew out of their binge-watching of romantic films during a bout of Covid and, like their previous tributes to Princess Diana andGwyneth Paltrow, is served with a mixture of camp irony and genuine affection.“Audiences can tell when you’ve done something with derision,” says Martin. “We love the films on which it is based, the good and the bad – and, boy, are there many bad ones!”As the big day approaches, how are the pre-wedding jitters? “This is the first time we have debuted a show in Edinburgh so maybe this level of stress will change things,” says Karp. “We’ll see if halfway through the fringe we still want to get married.”‘It’s physically demanding – you can’t let your partner down’View image in fullscreen‘Opening in Edinburgh has been vulnerable and exhilarating’ … Isak and Eowynn Enquist.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianA double helping of married couples are responsible for the aerial dance showImago. Created by two former Cirque du Soleil stars, this “epic tragic love story” is now entrusted to another husband and wife. And “entrusted” is the right word: nothing symbolises dependency more powerfully than an acrobat holding on to an airborne partner. Using apparatus devised to keep the performers in the air for unusually long periods, this is a show requiring high levels of trust.“It is emotionally and physically demanding and we know we can’t let our partner down on stage,” says Gabrielle Martin, who developed Imago with Jeremiah Hughes before she retired from the stage. “The truth is that gravity is trying to pull us apart. The chemistry and the struggle are real.”Hughes describes a three-minute sequence in which he would be suspended in the air with his wife hanging on his foot: “At no point was I thinking, ‘This feels hard on my body, we should have a break.’ It was: ‘She’s 15 feet off the ground. There’s no question of stopping.’”The couple are now directingEowynn and Isak Enquist in Imago, which has the dreamlike aesthetic of dance, rather than the shock and awe of circus. “It’s a cathartic journey for the audience,” says Martin. “And it is for Eowynn and Isak on stage.”For Martin and Hughes, working and playing together – not to mention bringing up a two year old – is a natural state of affairs. “So many of our production conversations are pillow talk,” says Hughes. “This work has brought a lot of beauty into our life and we’ve truly enjoyed placing it on to these new performers, who have also had to learn how to communicate when they’re exhausted and in the air. I don’t know that it could have happened with two that were not in an intimate relationship.”Martin adds: “We know how intense Edinburgh is, having been there once before – I remember crying my way home every other night.” How are the Enquists holding up? “People said it was going to be a whirlwind experience: we now understand what they meant. We have been training for Imago for two years – opening in Edinburgh has been vulnerable and exhilarating.”‘It’s easier to create an hour-long show to express how you feel than say it directly’View image in fullscreen‘Marnina and Micah get along way better than Eric and I’ … Chris Grace (seated) and Eric Michaud, directors of Couplet: Honey Honey Moon Moon.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianA honeymoon comedy set in the aftermath of a calamitous wedding is the work of another double helping of married couples. Created by Los Angeles musical duo Marnina Schon and Micah O’Konis, both fringe newcomers,Couplet: Honey Honey Moon Moonis directed by comedians Chris Grace and Eric Michaud, both Edinburgh old-hands.Revelling in their own cantankerousness, Grace and Michaud have been energised by the positive vibes of the younger couple. “Marnina and Micah get along way better than Eric and I do,” laughs Grace.“They’re much better fighters, I guess,” says Michaud. “Or they’re conflict avoidant,” says Grace. “It’s an ongoing debate about whether we want to model our relationship on theirs or they want to model theirs on ours.”View image in fullscreenHeightened comedy … Marnina Schon and Micah O’Konis, stars of Couplet: Honey Honey Moon Moon.Photograph: Jack MorrisSchon and O’Konis are classically trained musicians who tell the story of their relationship from inception to marriage through songs such as Our Wedding Venue Burned Down. The distinctive nature of their genderqueer relationship is summed up in People Think We’re Straight.“With Eric and me, it’s pretty obvious if we’re holding hands that we’re gay,” says Grace. “Marnina and Micah present as heteronormative. We were both at their wedding earlier this year and when family members gave speeches they used correct pronouns, which was a big milestone for them.”The show sees the funny side of all this. “They quote a line from aNew York Times interviewthat says there’s nothing they can’t sing and laugh their way through – and that’s really true,” says Michaud. “Rather than fighting, they’ll sit down and write a song. They’ll harness those feelings and create something out of it.”“They’re probably like us in that it’s almost easier to create an hour-long show to express how you feel than say it directly,” says Grace, who is also creating a new standup show every afternoon in27 Hours. “There’s a heightened comedic sensibility to their show but there’s not a ton of artifice.”Michaud agrees: “They seem unshakable as a couple, which is inspiring.” Grace quips back: “They have a joie de vivre that, as middle-aged men, we do not share.”‘We go to each other for solace’View image in fullscreenAbigail and Shaun Bengson, stars of Ohio.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianIf you want to know what love at first sight feels like, just ask Abigail and Shaun Bengson. Eighteen years ago, Abigail was invited to join Shaun’s band. Straight away they wrote a song. Three weeks later they were married.“Since then it’s all been making art together,” says Shaun, arriving in Edinburgh from the US with his parents and two children. Having met through music, they find it impossible to distinguish between their creative life and any other aspect of their relationship. “We were fired in the kiln of being musicians,” says Abigail. “We go to each other for solace.”Their show,Ohio, a music-theatre hybrid, is autobiographical in a way that both find exposing. It is about Shaun’s inherited degenerative hearing loss, their movement away from religion and their coming to terms with mortality. They call it an “ecstatic grief concert”.“The stage is where I feel the most unmasked and the most free,” says Abigail. “It is a vulnerable place to be but it’s also a place of power. Shaun and I are both disabled and our situations are degenerative. We’ve thought of it as a bummer, but mostly because it’s new and scary. We’re making this to get less afraid and more free about what it means to be a person moving into disability.”A few days in, the couple have tackled their fringe debut with characteristic enthusiasm. “It’s been gorgeous,” they say. “We’re entering the review maelstrom so we’re holding each other close: as autistic folks we’re used to being misunderstood and underestimated. What matters most is what happens in the room, which is when we feel most joyful.”‘We’ve been too exhausted to talk to each other’They met through comedy, working together on student sketches at the University of Bristol, and when lockdown put everything on hold, Ada Player and Bron Waugh simply carried on improvising. With a relationship like that, it is little wonder that their debut fringe show,Ada and Bron: The Origin of Love, is a compendium of offbeat skits on a theme of intimacy.“They’re characters we’ve been improvising since university and they all ended up being doomed romances and weird couples,” says Waugh, whose work on television with Player includes the short Channel 4 comedy Peaked. “We’ve taken tiny nuggets of our relationship, timesed them by 10 and made them into these cartoonish love stories,” says Player.View image in fullscreen‘The whole show is done in our pants and vest tops’ … Ada Player and Bron Waugh, stars of The Origin of Love.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianHow is their work/life balance? “You can make rules about not talking about the show in the evening, but sometimes it’s fun to do that,” she says. “It’s a constant back and forth. But it has made our stress around the show low, because if it’s our whole life, everything has to feel fun, light and energetic.”Waugh looks uncertain about that, but stressful or not, working from home has given The Origin of Love its distinctive quality. “We made the show in this closed space,” says Player. And even the costumes reflect the lockdown theme. “The whole show is done in our pants and vest tops,” says Waugh, although pianist Ed Lyness will be in a tux. “That would normally be something we’d be shy about, but because we’ve made the show in our bedrooms, we’ve not thought about what it would feel like in front of people.”Are there any tensions between Ada and Bron after their opening gigs? “Our show is at 11pm so resetting our body clocks means we’ve been too exhausted to talk to each other, let alone fight,” says Waugh. “Once we have settled into a rhythm we will have more energy to have a proper domestic,” says Player. “Honestly, can’t wait!”The Fit Prince …is at Pleasance Courtyard until 25 August.Awkward Prods Get Married (But for Real)is at Pleasance Courtyard on 16 August.Imagois at Assembly Roxy until 24 August.Couplet: Honey Honey Moon Moonis at Assembly Rooms until 24 August.Ohiois at Assembly Roxy until 24 August.Ada and Bron: The Origin of Loveis at Pleasance Courtyard until 24 August.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalFestivalsTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Performed by Sophie Anna Veelenturf of the Belgian company Berlin, it considers how much political opinions should affect our social and sexual relationships.Veelenturf talks directly from experience. An eager participant in online dating, she wonders which potential partners she is filtering out – and, likewise, which of them is filtering her out – because of their stated political leanings. On an app such as Bumble, she identifies herself as being leftwing and consequently meets like-minded people. In an increasingly polarised society, one tribe has decreasing opportunity to talk to the other. Left and right do not even meet, let alone exchange views.View image in fullscreenVeelenturf ponders politics …Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianBut there are exceptions. At the ages of 17, 21 and 23, Veelenturf dated three rightwing men, who she identifies respectively as Max, Noah and Jeff. As part of her research for Swiping Right, which consists primarily of recorded conversations, she contacted these and other friends and ex-partners to see how big a part they thought political difference played in their relationships.The picture that builds up is nuanced. There are those who seek to convert their partner to what they regard as the obvious rightness of their worldview. There are others who enjoy the excitement of being with someone who thinks passionately and independently even when they disagree. Some have too little interest in politics to care; others discover you can keep a lid on differences only until those differences start affecting life choices, such as the friend’s husband whose conservative values conflicted with her independence.That is before you include those free thinkers who vote right on some issues and left on others. Veelenturf is willing to be open minded, even if there are some lines she will not cross. If the show is theatrically constrained by its reliance on recordings, it raises spiky questions about the tricky business of getting along.AtZoo Southside, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreRelationshipsEdinburgh festivalDatingreviewsShareReuse this content"

But celebrity is always relative – and, for better or worse, most Proms artists don’t also headline stadium gigs.But Japanese composer and conductorJoe Hisaishi doesand, at 74, is a Proms debut artist like no other. He came on stage to waves of screaming and phones brandished to capture the moment. Never heard of him? You’re probably not part of the vast fanbase of the“cultural phenomenon” Studio Ghibli. Hisaishi is the John Williams of anime, responsible for the music in global hits fromMy Neighbour TotorotoThe Boy and the Heron.The European premiere of Hisaishi’s symphonic suite from the latter opened this Prom, with the composer switching between his own soulful piano part and conducting theRoyal Philharmonic Orchestra. Quacking produced by brass mouthpieces provoked giggles and the orchestra luxuriated in the expansive majesty of Hisaishi’s scoring. But this remained a short concert recap of one of Hisaishi’s blandest film scores.View image in fullscreenDouble duty … Hisaishi and countertenor John Holiday.Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCHisaishi’s suite The End of the World (another European premiere) was more ambitious. There were hints of Stravinsky, strictly atonal lyricism and big band jazz alongside symphonic landscaping that marshalled the RPO,BBC SingersandPhilharmonia Chorusinto sweeping waves of sound, all colourful post-minimalism topped by frothing strings. CountertenorJohn Holidaydid double duty with a starkly beautiful solo in the central movement and a final, crooning rendition of Skeeter Davis’s 1960s pop numberThe End of the World, stratospheric violins providing eerie “wrong” notes that soured an otherwise saccharine texture.In a flash of inspired programming,Steve Reich’s The Desert Music followed, led with tireless concentration by Hisaishi. This is epic minimalism, demanding immense stamina from the performers to sustain Reich’s vibrantly pulsing texture for 50 minutes. Two percussionists were allocated page turners, such is the score’s relentlessness. The BBC Singers andNational Youth Voices– lightly amplified, as Reich demands – produced a remarkable, studio-mixed choral blend, while the RPO’s labour-intensive loops and licks were intricately moreish, the slow-spun fabric utterly hypnotic.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

From childhood, she studied under master hardanger fiddler Knut Hamre, exploring the tunes, styles and effects associated with her instrument: its sympathetic strings, funnelled under the fingerboard, are particularly hypnotic, vibrating in response to the notes resonating above, as they do on the sitar and sarangi.View image in fullscreenBenedicte Maurseth: Mirra.Photograph: HubroA follow-up to Maurseth’s 2022 Nordic music prize-winning Hárr, Mirra is named after an old dialect word describing wild reindeer running together in a circling pattern. Norwegian folk’s rhythmic repetitions feed Maurseth’s intricate compositions (as do the influences of minimalism and Krautrock), but the contributions of her bandmates, and the rustling textures of animal sounds, are also key. The bass and electronics of Mats Eilertsen and the melodic percussion of Håkon Stene suggest honks and heavy steps, especially in the jangling title track and the ominous Jaktmarsj (Hunting March). The tremulous Kvitkrull (Reindeer Lichen) is influenced by 1978 Canadian film Sámi Herders, while Nysnø Over Reinlav (Fresh Snow Over Reindeer Moss) includes field recordings of 13 animals, including gyrfalcons, whimbrels and wolverines, alongside producer Morten Qvenild’s fluttering piano.Throughout the album, Maurseth’s fiddle is bowed, plucked and droned, evoking winds and weathers of all strengths. Her tentative, edgy melody on Kalven Reiser Seg (The Calf Rises), conveying the early hours of a deer’s life, is also a highlight. Maurseth recently said she has only seen wild reindeer twice in her life, despite living near them, once in herds of hundreds when she was seven. The possibility of fleeting magic, both instrumental and animal, is her album’s sparkling backbone.Folk, fiddles and foot-stomping: how gen Z rebooted old-school Norwegian musicRead moreAlso out this monthLondon duoSpafford Campbell’sTomorrow Held (Real World)brings a dreamy idea to life – what Talk Talk would sound like making an album inspired by British traditional music. Owen Spafford’s stark playing overlays Louis Campbell’s guitar reverb and minimalist shimmers to gorgeous effect in the instrumentals, while its sole song, the Campbell-sung All Your Tiny Bones, leans towards the dreamier moments of Bastille and Alt-J. Rooted in the traditions of English folk, Americana and old time music,Antony Hurley’sHowl for More (Lanterne)is a lovely, languid set of travelling songs, written between southern Italy, Mexico and the Kent coast. Finally,Teppana Jänis (Death is Not The End)is a fizzing, century-splicing collaboration betweenJänis, a Finnish zither player recorded on wax cylinders in the mid-1910s, singerTaito Hoffrén, who died in 2024, and contemporary kantele playerArja Kastinen.Explore more on these topicsFolk musicFolk album of the monthNorwayreviewsShareReuse this content"

Single-player, story-led action experiences with a weekend’s worth of choreographed set pieces and an open world glazed with a fine mist of collectibles … But here in 2025, the age of the Battle Pass and live service forever games, Hangar 13’s solo adventure about Sicilian crime families feels almost as dated as its 1900s setting.In fact, The Old Country has few new ideas to contribute to the cover shooter genre, nor to the Mafia series itself. Hangar 13 already produced aremake in 2020 of the original Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven, but in this game it often feels like the studio’s remaking it yet again in a different setting. Both the storyline and structure of its individual missions seem to be at the very least giving a reverential nod of the fedora to that 2002 title.View image in fullscreenYou can see where this is going … Mafia: The Old Country.Photograph: 2K GamesCase in point: the “win a race to impress your Don” mission trope. This chapter was infamous in the original Mafia because the 1930s race cars were extremely hard to handle and the race was all but unwinnable, but it was also a sophisticated multi-stage mission structure full of sabotage, theft and unexpected double-crossings. Mafia: The Old Country simply has you riding out to a town where a race is due to take place, then tells you the Don needs a replacement rider and drops you into the saddle for an uneventful canter around a course that features no real challenge. Ten years ago, such a by-the-numbers experience would have been criticised, but right now the scarcity of games like this means you’re inclined to look past the basic mission design and enjoy its strongest assets instead: its story, and its sense of time and place.It’s 1904 and you are Enzo Favara, an unfortunate young man with no family to speak of who finds himself working down in the sulphur mines with his fellowcarusiin their yellow-stained rags and shaven heads. After working conditions at the mine tip past horrific and into fatal, Enzo stands up to his sadistic employers and makes a powerful enemy in Don Ruggero Spadaro, the local “businessman” who owns the mine. Not to worry, though – after fleeing, he’s taken in by Don Torrisi, a rival of Spadaro’s, who appreciates the young man’s bravery and work ethic. You can see where this is going.View image in fullscreenRich setting … Mafia: The Old Country.Photograph: 2K GamesWhat follows is your typical ascendancy through the ranks of a crime family, expressed through the medium of knife fights and old timey shootouts, in the era when reloading a pistol takes three to five days. Local businesses refuse to pay up. Workers go on strike. Bandits and rival families threaten your reputation. You journey to a locale that’s conveniently littered with waist-high cover, hunker down and set to them.In fairness to Enzo and his associates, missions aren’t always about all-out violence. At times you’re sneaking around, distracting guards by throwing coins and bottles to lure them away from your path. There’s a lot of riding horses and driving cars and plenty of expository chat to deepen the context of your actions either side of the fracas. These mechanics outside combat are not especially exciting, but this is a mafia game. It’s not trying to be a deep, systems-laden experience – it just wants to tell you a gangster story.And by the skin of its teeth, it succeeds in that endeavour. But it does so via premise rather than plot. The beats are predictable. The memorable moments aren’t clever lines of dialogue or dramatic denouements, but vivid historical details. Pheasants strung up in pantries, baskets of citrus fruit piled high in fields. Workers stamping on grapes in the Torrisi vineyard. Historically accurate recipes for spezzatino di maiale on kitchen counters. The Sicilian dialect peppered throughout each conversation (I heartily recommend going all-in and changing to Sicilian audio localisation with English subtitles). Here is a game that has done its research, and brought to life a geographical and historical setting previously unvisited by games. And done it so well that it proves to be Mafia: The Old Country’s saving grace.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We started in Lake Bled. Teens loved the Dolinka ziplines, the summer toboggan run, hiking in Vintgar gorge and swimming in Lake Bled. You can hire paddleboards and boats. If you have the money, there is rafting and canyoning too. After seeing the incredible Postojna cave, we went up the Vogel cable by Lake Bohinj. Half-board at theBohinj Eco hotelkept the teens amply fed and it also has an aquapark, bowling and plenty of games to boot. We finished the trip off with shopping in Ljubljana and the best ice-cream ever at Romantika. Three happy teenagers.SueAll aboard in the NetherlandsView image in fullscreenCanal boats were a hit for tipster Annette’s family.Photograph: Wiskerke/AlamyOur favourite family holiday was to the Netherlands: taking turns playing captain guiding electric hire boats on canals; tilting our ice-cream cones at windmills at Zaanse Schans; cycling to the broad, clean beaches for mocktails in cabanas; Amsterdam for the colourful Pride parade counterpointed by a quiet, calming visit to De Poezenboot (which teen could resist a cat sanctuary on a canal boat?). And staying in Haarlem in an apartment with speedy wifi kept the teens happy while we indulged in morning strolls through medieval cobbled streets to Grote Markt for coffee and people-watching.AnnetteProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

We have been twice with our teens, and sent friends too! A mile-long beach where teenagers can roam and paddleboard, an easy train journey to explore Rome, lunchtime pizza slices with locals cheering on the footie at L’Angolo delle Crepes. Plus the opportunity to sleep in a castle at hostel prices. Fluffy white towels aplenty, but also a gleaming kitchen if you want to cook. Don’t miss the nearby necropolis for an Indiana Jones-style adventure. Fireworks over the castle and a hilarious Italian Beatles cover band were theciliegina sulla torta!MargaretDracula and bear-spotting in RomaniaView image in fullscreenBrown bears cross a road in Romania.Photograph: Heckepics/Getty ImagesThe best European trip with my teen (so far) has to be Romania. We stayed in Brașov, booked an apartment with a pool and had the best time. There is so much to do and lots of easy public transport. We ate outdoors at little cafes on the street, took a cable car up the mountain, went on a trip to see bears in the forest (up close and personal!), had a tree-top adventure at Adventure Park and visited Dracula’s castle. The town itself is historic and beautiful, and the people are so welcoming. It’s not your typical British tourist destination but it makes for a fabulous adventure.KateWhen in Rome … take a Vespa tour!View image in fullscreenVespas in Rome.Photograph: Loop Images Ltd/AlamyRome in October half-term. Coliseum and Forum tours gave the right balance of interesting history, fun facts and a bit of gore that most teenagers would be entranced by! Walked a lot without seeming to walk a lot. A two-hour Vespa tour was the highlight. You hang on to the drivers and they negotiate the traffic, show you a different Rome with local knowledge and attitude. To complete the adventure: guaranteed great food, gelato and, for weary parents of an evening, vino cheapo!RuthAustria’s Alpine summer wonderlandView image in fullscreenA waterpark in Saalbach-Hinterglemm.Photograph: Josef Kubes/AlamySaalbach-Hinterglemm in Austria in the summer meant hiking, ebiking and waterparks. Take advantage of the Joker card for free or reduced-price access to lots of activities. Hire a car to make the most of local resorts with lakeside beach clubs, alpine zoos, glacier visits and summer toboggan runs. Plenty to keep teens entertained.HilaryAn epic train journey across EuropeView image in fullscreenThe Deyrolle taxidermy shop in Paris.Photograph: Only France/AlamyLast summer I went with my two children on a trip north through Scandinavia, then back via the Baltic countries. This turned into an epic 5,000-mile train journey, which we each took part in planning. The 10-year-old’s focus was on cycling, swimming, play parks and cat cafes. The 14-year-old took us to the KGB headquarters in Riga, a tour around Berlin, and a visit to the Deyrolle taxidermy shop in Paris. By handing over some planning and responsibility to the kids, I could relax; they were engaged in activities away from their devices and their geography knowledge improved!Sarah PatelCosmopolitan and exotic AntwerpView image in fullscreenThe cafe at MoMu.Photograph: Stany Dederen/Matthias De BoeckAntwerp by Eurostar was perfect. Coffee and buns at Pakt every morning, cool galleries like MoMu and Fomu every day, kilo vintage shopping, art nouveau streets, incredible Korean, Vietnamese and Nepalese restaurants, and bikes! Perfect October break.GeorgiaPostcard from the edge of Belleville, ParisView image in fullscreenDavid Hockney paintings at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris.Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersA brief holiday for us this year with our 15-year-old son but it was plenty – five nights in a gorgeous apartment on the edge of Belleville, Paris, not far from Buttes-Chaumont. He’s the age where we can enjoy both Disneyland and then take in the Hockney retrospective at the stunning Fondation Louis Vuitton. Back at base we watched city life unfold from our French windows and then sampled Lebanese, Laos and French meals in the bustling streets around. Nearer to town, the family-run Eats Thyme is a standout.GingerGigoloWinning tip: Oompah and cable cars in BavariaView image in fullscreenA terrace on the summit of the Germany’s highest mountain, Zugspitze.Photograph: Mauritius Images /AlamyA two-centre holiday to Munich and Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Bavaria, Germany, is a must with teenagers as there is so much to see and do. In Munich they loved the atmosphere in the beer halls – eating pretzels and listening to the oompah band and watching the Rathaus-Glockenspiel in the square. A visit to the Olympiapark is also recommended. In Garmisch-Partenkirchen there is a toboggan run, which is great fun, and nearby is the beautiful Zugspitze mountain and cable car, with boating on Eibsee lake. Bavaria has plenty to keep teenagers entertained and active, for a very enjoyable holiday.Richard WatkinsView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsFamily holidaysReaders' travel tipsEurope holidaysTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Customise this one by swapping the almonds for pistachios, and serving it with cherries or other seasonal fruit. Do seek out the anise seeds, though, because they add such a lovely pop of flavour. The praline can be made up to a week ahead and stored in an airtight container in the freezer, while the semifreddo itself will keep happily in the freezer for about a week.Honey and almond semifreddo with nectarinesPrep5 minCook1 hr 15 minFreezeOvernightServes8For the praline90g sugar70g whole roasted almondsPinch of sea saltFor the semifreddo5 egg yolks20g runny honey80g caster sugar2 egg whites300ml double cream1 tsp anise seeds, lightly toasted and crushed in a mortarFor the nectarines2 tsp caster sugar2 tsp lemon juice2 tsp runny honeyA pinch of salt4 ripe nectarines1 sprigfresh basil or mint, leaves roughly tornLine a baking tray with greaseproof paper and set aside. To make the praline, put the sugar and 30ml water in a small saucepan and set it over a low heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then turn up the heat to medium-high and cook, without stirring but swirling the pan occasionally, until the mix turns a deep golden colour. Stir in the almonds, then pour on to the lined tray, sprinkle with sea salt and leave to cool and harden. Once hardened, break up the praline, then pulse in a food processor (or bash with a rolling pin) to break down into small, irregular pieces no larger than 1cm. Store in an airtight container in the freezer until needed.Line the base and sides of a 10cm x 20cm loaf tin with greaseproof paper, leaving a generous overhang to help you lift the semifreddo out later. Fill a medium saucepan a third of the way up with water and bring to a simmer. In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks, honey and 40g sugar, then set the bowl over the pan, ensuring the base isn’t touching the water. Whisk for six to eight minutes, until thick and pale, then take off the heat and whisk (ideally over a bowl of ice) until cooled.Put the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer and whisk until white and foamy. Gradually beat in the remaining 40g sugar, whisking until it dissolves and the mix comes to firm peaks. Scrape the meringue into the egg yolk bowl, but don’t mix it in just yet.In the same bowl and with the same whisk attachment (no need to wash them), whip the cream to soft peaks. Scrape this into the yolk bowl, too, then add the anise seeds and praline, and fold until just combined. Scrape the mixture into the lined tin, smooth the top and freeze overnight (or for up to a week).About 30 minutes before serving, prepare the nectarines. In a medium bowl, whisk the sugar, lemon juice, honey and salt. Halve and stone the nectarines, then cut them into 1cm wedges. Toss with the syrup and herbs, then leave to macerate.To serve, lift the semifreddo out of its tin using the overhang, then cut into roughly 2½cm-thick slices. Arrange on plates, spoon the nectarines on top and serve at once.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotIce-cream and sorbetDessertFruitSummer food and drinkEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"

His book Porter and Stout: A Complete History, which had taken him seven years to write, was published three days later.It covers 300 years and 56 countries, and caps an impressive output of entertaining, informative and myth-debunking books. They include Beer: The Story of the Pint (2004); Amber, Gold & Black: The History of Britain’s Great Beers (2010); Strange Tales of Ale (2015); and Around the World in 80 Beers: A Global History of Brewing (2024). He won several awards from the British Guild ofBeerWriters.Born in Hampstead, Martyn grew up in Stevenage. His father, Arthur, was a bricklayer and his mother, Daphne (nee Donno), a shorthand typist. Martyn went to Alleyne’s grammar school in Stevenage, then studied politics at Sussex University, followed by a diploma in journalism at the City of London Polytechnic. In 1995 he gained an MBA from Thames Valley University.Starting out as a reporter in Hitchin on the Stevenage Comet, he was an editor on the Informer stable of newspapers in Surrey and west London, which is where we were fellow journalists and became friends. Later Martyn was a subeditor on the Times, the Daily Telegraph and the South China Morning Post.At the Times he rose to the challenge brilliantly when asked to write a four-line headline across a single column width for a story about Michael Foot, the then Labour party leader, leading a committee looking at nuclear disarmament. Martyn said: “I certainly wasn’t going to get ‘nuclear’ or ‘disarmament’ or ‘committee’ to fit, so after a struggle I decided on ‘Foot chairs arms body’, then thought ‘Foot heads arms body’ would at least give a laugh to the revise sub. To my astonishment, the headline was printed.”In 2007, Martyn launched a popular, award-winning blog,Zythophile– the word, derived from Greek, means “a lover of beer”. The range of categories – nearly 60, from ageing beer to yeast – demonstrated his sweep of knowledge. There are 105 posts alone on beer styles.Martyn’s writing packed a punch. “If I read once more that porter got its name because it was ‘popular with the porters of Covent Garden, Smithfield and Billingsgate’, I am going to slap someone with a malt shovel,” he wrote, in what turned out to be his last post. A lover of books and music, Martyn was affable, modest and humorous, and in demand at conferences and beer-judging competitions worldwide. The University of Gastronomic Sciences in Pollenzo, Italy, used his writing for course work.Martyn is survived by his wife, Emer, from whom he separated four years ago but with whom he remained great friends, their daughter, Mara, and his younger brother, Dave.Explore more on these topicsBeerOther livesFood and drink booksManufacturing sectorFoodobituariesShareReuse this content"

But he knew for sure they would be a big hindrance as soon asDonald Trumpannounced late last month that he was slapping a 15% levy on all goods from the European Union.“The first email I received was from my cork provider,” Burke recalled. “He said he’d take on 2% of the additional cost of importing corks from Europe, but I would have to absorb the other 13%. Then my barrel supplier got in touch, pushing me to put in my orders as fast as possible because every new French barrel coming across the Atlantic after the tariffs was going to come with a $100 or $150 fee.”Every one of these messages was a gut punch for Burke’s five-year-old family-run business, Dresser Winery, which sits on an idyllic hillside outside Paso Robles and specializes in big, bold reds. Burke sent a note out to his wine club members earlier this year telling them he did not plan on increasing prices for the fall shipment, but he realized he could no longer honor the commitment.“If we do that,” he said flatly, “we have to shut the business down.”It turns out even US wine producers are heavily reliant on foreign components – everything from French oak barrels, which give the wine a buttery, vanilla finish in contrast to the much less appealing brown sugar taste of American oak, to glass bottles and corks and the wine-making equipment itself.“Every single product we use, from our pumps to the de-stemmer, comes with instructions written in six languages,” Burke explained. “Could we produce some of these things here? Sure, but it would take three years to get production up and running, and that’s not the way the specialization has been.”As another producer from Paso Robles, Paul Hoover of Still Waters Vineyards, put it: “The only thing in my bottles made in America is the wine.”Ostensibly, Trump’s tariffs on imported goods are supposed to give a competitive boost to American entrepreneurs like Burke and Hoover. But the theory does not really apply to the wine business – not only because so many of the materials used to makeCaliforniawine come from overseas, but also because people do not buy wine based on price alone.“It is a fundamental misunderstanding of wine drinkers and the wine marketplace,” the National Association of Wine Retailers, an industry lobby group, said in ablistering statementin response to the 15% tariff announcement.View image in fullscreen‘When an American wine drinker asks for red Burgundy, they do not substitute Oregon pinot noir when the Burgundy is out of their price range or unavailable. They simply don’t make a purchase.’Photograph: Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images“Champagne is not sparkling wine. Bordeaux is not simply cabernet sauvignon or merlot … America’s independent fine wine retailers understand better than most that when an American wine drinker asks for red Burgundy, they do not substitute Oregon pinot noir when the Burgundy is out of their price range or unavailable. They simply don’t make a purchase.”Burke echoed this sentiment, saying he had to control his reaction recently when a Trump supporter came to his winery and told him he must be excited about the business opportunities the tariffs will create. “People aren’t buying my bottles because of tariffs on French wines, that’s for sure,” he said. “If anything, I’m competing against other Californian and American wines. With European wines, it’s not a real competition at all. They’re very different regions, very different products.”California wines are far from the cheapest because of the high cost of land and labour in the Golden state. For that reason, many producers live or die by the quality of what they make and the sort of subtle distinctions that come from varietals grown in a particular microclimate, or in a particular soil, or aged in a particular barrel.Price still matters, because fine wines are a discretionary spending item, and if the economy or people’s personal finances are struggling it is often one of the first things that consumers stop buying. The National Association of Wine Retailers, said it was worried about tariffs generally, not just on wine, because inflation and an uncertain business climate would hurt its members’ bottom line just as much.“The increased costs of living that will result from the recently enacted tariffs, along with the significant increase in prices for wines … will only push down consumption further, thereby harming the American wine industry to a degree from which many of its participants will not recover,” the group said.In Paso Robles, which has seen an explosion in the number of wineries over the past two decades to about 250 and has become a major weekend tourist hub for wine lovers from San Francisco and Los Angeles, some of the harmful effects are being felt already.Joel Peterson, executive director of the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance, said international orders were drying up as the reverberations from Trump’s trade war echo around the globe. “We have wine sitting in a warehouse that is specially labeled for the Canadian market that producers can’t sell,” he said. “We’ve had no orders from the UK since Trump’s so-called Liberation Day in April. People are scared to order those wines.”Domestic retailers say they have not seen significant price increases kick in yet – for either domestic or European wines – but are already starting to struggle simply because of the uncertainty created by the White House’s constantly shifting messages on where and at what rate it intends to impose tariffs.“We’re not in a recession but it’s what I call a recess market,” said Jim Knight, co-owner of the Wine House in Los Angeles, which specializes in small-label boutique wines from the United States and around the world. “People have money, they’re just not spending it … If the president made a decision and stuck with it, we could plan for it. But we haven’t been able to plan for it.”Knight’s business has a particular problem with high-end French wines it bought in advance years ago – right after the grapes were harvested – and presold to customers with an anticipated 10% mark-up. When tariffs on European wines were briefly at 10% earlier this year, Knight was looking at his entire profit being wiped out, since tariffs are imposed when goods arrive in the United States, not when they are purchased. Now, at 15%, he’s looking at taking a loss that might force him to lay off workers or otherwise shrink his business.For now, he is letting the wine sit in a temperature-controlled storage unit in France and hoping Trump might still bend to pressure from the industry to create a tariff exception for wines and spirits. An industry initiative calledToasts not Tariffshas been lobbying the White House hard to do exactly that.More broadly, Knight said he was worried that small European producers would no longer offer their limited production to the US market, and that some of the specialist importers, the ones who love the same smaller label wines he does, will go out of business. “Importers of wine from the European Union are American businesses too,” he remarked.That helps explain why a US distributor of European wines and spirits,VOS Selectionsof New York, has been the lead plaintiff in alawsuitchallenging the constitutionality of Trump’s tariffs – a case that led to an initial ruling against the administration in the court of international trade at the end of May.Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University who has spearheaded the suit, said the nature of the wine business was a vivid illustration of the harm that tariffs can do. “Many of the wines our client imports simply cannot be produced in the United States because of differences in climate, soil and other factors,” he said. “We’re not benefiting American industry, we’re damaging it and hurting consumers.”Not every wine producer sees the economic outlook as uniformly gloomy. Hoover, of Still Waters Vineyards, said the cost of storing and transporting wine was a greater burden than the price of corks or bottles – particularly for California producers who have too much inventory on their hands following a post-Covid boom-and-bust cycle. He said he was relieved at adrop in fuel pricesin recent months and saw opportunities if they fell further.He was modestly hopeful, for example, that he could tap into sales opportunities on the east coast where he was previously priced out. “Before the tariffs, a boat coming from Europe could deliver wine to the east coast more efficiently than I could getting it across the United States on a truck,” he said. “Let’s see how that looks going forward. Energy costs are the key to this. Let’s hope the tariffs don’t monkey that up.”One of the main reasons that people in the wine business do not believe the tariffs will benefit domestic producers, as the White House is promising, is that they have seen this scenario play out before, during Trump’s first term as president.In 2019, the administration imposed a25% tariffon most European wines, among other products, in retaliation for European subsidies on Airbus passenger jets. Trump said at the time that the relatively low price of French wines was unfair to California producers, but no evidence emerged that the tariff did anything to redress that perceived unfairness. “It did not increase my domestic wine sales at all,” Knight said.Explore more on these topicsWineWest CoastCaliforniaTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"
